        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>How deep does Alex ever go? It&#39;s always <em>muh globalists reptillians Bilderberg</em> You think Alex doesn&#39;t know about neo Aristotlean elite bloodlines? The Vatican? Khazarian crypto Jews? Rothschilds Rockerfellers? Come on. </p>

<p><a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=dYl9iZlArjM">why is Alex Gatekeeping for CNP?</a> </p>

<p>Well maybe because a little bit of research into them will take you from Rothschilds all the way to Trump.</p>

<p>Well first we can start with you see Jerome Corsi (Washington correspondent Infowars) is a member of <a href="http://wariscrime.com/new/how-the-big-brother-controls-alternative-media/">CNP</a> - council for national policy. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.google.co.uk/amp/www.rawstory.com/2016/08/trump-campaign-ceo-and-manager-part-of-secret-extremist-right-wing-group-splc/amp/">As is Bannon.</a> Conway. Erik Prince of blackwater fame. Oliver North. Iran Contra. Cocaine running under Bush. So we see the same necons of Bush cabinet, behind Trump this time around. Breitbart was <a href="http://www.npr.org/2017/03/22/521083950/inside-the-wealthy-family-that-has-been-funding-steve-bannon-s-plan-for-years">founded by the Mercer family.</a>.</p>

<hr/>

<p>The Mercer family <a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Space:Rothschild&#x27;s_Bank_-_The_Best_Club_In_London">are an old Rothschild proxy, very old money.</a><br/>
 Its a rarely discussed but very relevant fact that <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/amp/s/amp.theguardian.com/politics/2017/feb/26/us-billionaire-mercer-helped-back-brexit">Mercer was decisive in securing key positions for his long time family advisers </a> - Kellyane Conway &amp; Robert Bannon . In addition to working as assets on Mercer family projects, <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/amp/s/www.bloomberg.com/amp/politics/articles/2016-08-17/trump-s-new-team-brings-deep-ties-to-major-donor">Mercer had Conway organise the spending for Cruz&#39;s failed campaign.</a> . After which they changed their support to Trump. <a href="https://littlesis.org/org/37180/Council_for_National_Policy">The Mercer Foundation also happens to be the #1 financier of CNP</a>. <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/amp/s/www.bloomberg.com/amp/politics/articles/2016-11-11/rebekah-mercer-daughter-of-major-donor-named-to-trump-role">You may have seen Rebekah Mercer</a> named as part of Trumps transition team.</p>

<hr/>

<p>150 CNP members recently signed a draft of an executive order, <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/amp/s/www.toddstarnes.com/column/conservatives-call-on-trump-to-protect-religious-liberty%3Fformat%3Damp">to protect Religious Liberty</a> .</p>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>If signed it would create wholesale exemptions from a range of nondiscrimination laws and regulations “for people and organizations who claim religious objections to same-sex marriage, premarital sex, abortion, and trans identity.” </p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>After 8, years of liberal policies from Obama, the introduction of such a bill is designed to cause extreme unrest and division. As is always the case- when we fight each other, we remain blissfully unaware of the hidden hands.</p>

<p>So it becomes clear, not only is Trump controlled opposition, but the alternative media that support him, his advisers, shady conservative think tanks that produce his policy and the (sadbuttrue)worlds most recognisable conspiracy personality are all Rothschild/ Cabal entities. <a href="http://www.spirituallysmart.com/Jones-CIA.htm">Alex has acknowledge his family worked in the CIA</a>.</p>

<hr/>

<p>None of this new however. If you&#39;ve been following Trumps cabinet picks, you might remember <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/amp/www.latimes.com/politics/la-na-pol-wilbur-ross-commerce-20161208-story,amp.html">Wilbur Ross?</a>. Working for Rothschild inc in 1990 Ross helped Trump avoid bankruptcy after the latter missed multiple bond payments on the struggling Taj Mahal. 
At the time it was known Trumps finances were unravelling and he&#39;d been unable to secure finances until Rothschild Inc sent Ross to save the day.</p>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>When asked why he&#39;d made a deal with Trump, Ross insisted that Trump was worth saving.
&quot;“The Trump name is still very much an asset,” he said.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>The Rothschild were wise to deploy Mercer &amp; Ross to assist Trump over the years, they certainly seem to have accquired a prime asset in Trump, no doubt. The President of the United States is fully under Rothschild/Cabal control. A traitor is in the White House. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The bigger point is that CFR/left and CNP/right represent a synthetic binary that is inauthentic (that&#39;s what I mean by synthetic). They are both funded by the same ppl and rather than advocate for  relevant policy, they work in tandem to control a divided public. All the talking heads, money, propaganda is leveraged for this vital goal: keep ppl divided, so they&#39;re distracted from asking bigger questions. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>“If you don&#39;t have a plan, you become part of somebody else&#39;s plan.” ― Terence McKenna</p>

<p>Substituting the word &quot;solution&quot; for plan I think is how the specifics of this works. Because bringing up another saying that&#39;s quoted often: &quot;Focus on the solution, not the problem&quot;.</p>

<p>People have bought into the notion that the &quot;solution&quot; is human beings are by nature &quot;competitive&quot;. Thus the overwhelming and oppressive &quot;war&quot; mentality literally everywhere (this &quot;war&quot; mentality has permeated every single aspect of our global culture that I&#39;ve had a chance to observe in my 40 years of existence - and this is what I&#39;ve referred to in my numerous past posts referring to the &quot;nightmare that is my domestic situation).</p>

<p>Not saying competition is &quot;wrong&quot;. What I am saying is there&#39;s a choice of how to view the world. And how one views the world is what will be created. If one were to view the world as &quot;cooperative&quot; in place of &quot;competitive&quot; - then that is the world that person would inhabit.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s a little bit of Seth talking about this from Unknown Reality Vol 1 page 457:</p>

<p>&quot;Your world view is your personalized interpretation of the physical universe. If that view is expansive, then you have far greater leeway in creating your experience.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This post is a wake up call to a sub that used to be able to see past the false dichotomy. I wrote a piece on rising Democrat star Tulsi Gabbard, calling her membership of CFR info question. If you continue in my post history past that post to before the election you&#39;ll see me stating that Trump had done a good job in calling attention to the bs media. I was very much willing to give him a chance till he gave me reason to do otherwise. Having done so since taking office, my stance has changed accordingly.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Were you aware of Mercers relationship <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/amp/s/amp.theguardian.com/politics/2017/feb/26/robert-mercer-breitbart-war-on-media-steve-bannon-donald-trump-nigel-farage">with Farage?</a>  </p>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Prominent rightwing journalist Andrew Breitbart, who founded the site but died in 2012, told Bannon that they had “to take back the culture”. And, arguably, they have, though American culture is only the start of it. In 2014, Bannon launched Breitbart London, telling the New York Times it was specifically timed ahead of the UK’s forthcoming election. It was, he said, the latest front “in our current cultural and political war”. </p>

<p>Cambridge Analytica worked for the Trump campaign and, so I’d read, the Leave campaign. When Mercer supported Cruz, Cambridge Analytica worked with Cruz. When Robert Mercer started supporting Trump, Cambridge Analytica came too. And where Mercer’s money is, Steve Bannon is usually close by: it was reported that until recently he had a seat on the board.</p>

<p>On its website, Cambridge Analytica makes the astonishing boast that it has psychological profiles based on 5,000 separate pieces of data on 220 million American voters – its USP is to use this data to understand people’s deepest emotions and then target them accordingly. The system, according to Albright, amounted to a “propaganda machine”.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>Mercer controls companies that influenced both the leave campaign and us election. Two of the greatest political shocks in history. At the heart of each, the Rothschild proxy. This is not a coincidence.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The reserve currency transition is a cycle that has typically lasted in history somewhere between 80 to 110 years. Officially, the US dollar has been the reserve currency for 68 years. However, the US dollar was used in trade much before, since the 1920s, in fact. That would put the US dollar closer to 90+ years as the reserve currency.</p>

<p>It has happened many times before. &quot;They&quot; cycle through countries about once every hundred years. When the debt is unbearably high, &quot;they&quot; crash the system and move on to the next country. Parasites.</p>

<p>Once again and slowly: unless an economic miracle happens, the US dollar is going to crash down. Trump might have been hired to do exactly that.</p>

<p>And yet, exactly at this phase there is a Council for National Policy member Steve Bannon in the WH, the same Bannon who is obsessed with the theory of <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/book-steve-bannon-is-obsessed-with-the-fourth-turning-2017-2">The Fourth Turning</a></p>

<p><em>This fact should concern every American.</em></p>

<p><em>In the book, authors William Strauss and Neil Howe theorize that the history of a people moves in 80-to-100 year cycles called &quot;saecula.&quot; The idea goes back to the ancient Greeks, who believed that at a given saeculum&#39;s end, there would come &quot;ekpyrosis,&quot; a cataclysmic event that destroys the old order and brings in a new one in a trial of fire.</em></p>

<p><em>This era of change is known as the Fourth Turning, and Bannon, like Strauss and Howe, believes we are in the midst of one right now.</em></p>

<p><em>According to the book, the last two Fourth Turnings that America experienced were the Civil War and the Reconstruction, and then the Great Depression and World War II. Before that, it was the Revolutionary War.</em></p>

<p><em>All these were marked by periods of dread and decay in which the American people were forced to unite to rebuild a new future, *</em>but only after a massive conflict in which many lives were lost.** It all starts with a catalyst event, then there&#39;s a period of regeneracy, after that there is a defining climax in which a war for the old order is fought, and then finally there is a resolution in which a new world order is stabilized.*</p>

<p><em>This is where Bannon&#39;s obsession with this book should cause concern. He believes that, for the new world order to rise, there must be a massive reckoning. That we will soon reach our climax conflict. *</em>In the White House, he has shown that he is willing to advise Trump to enact policies that will disrupt our current order to bring about what he perceives as a necessary new one.** He encourages breaking down political and economic alliances and turning away from traditional American principles to cause chaos.*</p>

<p>Bannon is prepping you. /s</p>

<p>Does it really have to be this way?</p>

<p>Where is proof that bannon is obsessed with that book. Author provides zero sources or proof, just flat out calls it as fact.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For example:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/steve-bannon-apocalypse_us_5898f02ee4b040613138a951">Steve Bannon Believes The Apocalypse Is Coming And War Is Inevitable</a></p>

<p>(...) Bannon, who’s now ensconced in the West Wing as President Donald Trump’s closest adviser, has been portrayed as Trump’s main ideas guy. But in interviews, speeches and writing — and especially in his embrace of Strauss and Howe — he has made clear that he is, first and foremost, an apocalypticist.</p>

<p>In Bannon’s view, we are in the midst of an existential war, and everything is a part of that conflict. Treaties must be torn up, enemies named, culture changed. Global conflagration, should it occur, would only prove the theory correct. For Bannon, the Fourth Turning has arrived. The Grey Champion, a messianic strongman figure, may have already emerged. The apocalypse is now.</p>

<p>“What we are witnessing,” Bannon told The Washington Post last month, “is the birth of a new political order.”</p>

<p>(...)</p>

<p>“This is the fourth great crisis in American history,” Bannon told an audience at the Liberty Restoration Foundation, a conservative nonprofit, in 2011. “We had the Revolution. We had the Civil War. We had the Great Depression and World War II. This is the great Fourth Turning in American history, and we’re going to be one thing on the other side.”</p>

<p>Major crises “happen in about 80- or 100-year cycles,” Bannon told a conference put on by the Republican women’s group Project GoPink that same year. “And somewhere over the next 10 or 20 years, we’re going to come through this crisis, and we’re either going to be the country that was bequeathed to us or it’s going to be something that’s completely or totally different.”</p>

<p>The “Judeo-Christian West is collapsing,” he went on. “It’s imploding. And it’s imploding on our watch. And the blowback of that is going to be tremendous.”</p>

<p>War is coming, Bannon has warned. In fact, it’s already here.</p>

<p>It seems they might have succeeded with the idea implanting in your case. Here my advice to you: if war, then let&#39;s fight them with their own weapons. Become wealthy. They are afraid of rich and influential middle/working calls that has time to think WHY is is governed by incompetent genocidal maniacs. How do you become wealthy? Demand that Trump takes the evil bankers down, seizes the Federal Reserve and issues interest-free currency to finance major infrastructure projects that will generate major wealth and benefit the working class. Problem solved. No real, destructive wars needed.</p>

<p>Current 4th turning seems to fall in with a trump presidency. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Illuminati was formed in 1776.</p>

<p>The cold war never ended. WWIII was conceived on 9/11, if there will be one. A third world war may cover a financial crash of the USD, like it did before. Hopefully WWIII will be aborted.</p>

<p>With the way the Federal Reserve private banking cartel is set up, the USD will eventually crash. Without the petrodollar system, the USD would have collapsed decades ago. The USD is the world reserve currency and effects the value of most, if not, all other currencies, especially fiat ones. Under the petrodollar system, many countries are forced to trade oil for USD. Leaders and governments that decide to use another, often gold backed currency, are taken out (Saddam Hussein, Gaddafi, etc.).</p>

<p>Global Elites like the Rothschilds have funded both sides of many western wars since Napoleon. After WWI, the Rockefellers and the Rothschilds created the League of Nations, a step into global governing. The same and other global elites financed the second world war (included papa HW Bush&#39;s papa, who has funded the Nazis in WWII).</p>

<p>After WWII, the Rockefellers and the Rothschilds created the United Nations. The Rockefellers and the Rothschilds are two of the families of &quot;The Council of 13&quot; (highest known, but others may be even above them) of the &quot;Illuminati&quot; - but for not getting labeled as a &quot;nutter&quot; - call them the global elites. </p>

<p>Anyway, there are people that profit from the war industry itself (Haliburton, Boeing, arms &amp; ammunition manufacturers ect.).</p>

<p>Certain global elites started in oil and/or banking (such as the Rockefellers and Rothschilds), which remain as key avenues. Some families have also went into big pharma, biotech, MSM, federal politics, etc.</p>

<p>All wars are bankers wars. Most, if not all wars in the last or few centuries were just business opportunities and to expand powers of business and revenue (the fundamental basis of the global elites (see Confessions of an Economic Hitman by John Perkins, War is a Racket by Major General Smedley D Butler (the highest decorated general in US history (served 33 years and 4 months))), the Shock Doctrine by Naomi Klein, etc.).</p>

<p>The wars of the lest century and onward are at least for profit and natural resources like oil, minerals, gold (See Ukraine - most of their gold went missing after the western backed Neo Nazis took over the government) - but it does not end there - their thirst for power includes controlling forieng government puppets, central banks, and leverage over Russia, especial in those regions.</p>

<p>However, the people (Rockefellers, Rothschilds, other global elites) also control Russia (or at least the people above them control them both). One or some of the people that are running the IMF and/or World Bank also control the Russian powered BRICS banks.</p>

<p>The end goal of these global elites is rather cliche - they want total control over everything on this planet, like a psychopath. The end goal of most of these western global elites is to have a one world government and one world currency, all under their control. </p>

<p>These powers that be want total control over everything and everyone on this planet, just like how the original Illuminati had wanted to do before they were caught and diminished. </p>

<p>Were they truely executed or did they reimerged like a Phoenix from a satanic hellfire? The original Bavarian Illuminati had contingency plans for if they were discovered and stopped. By the way things are going, their contingency plans have prevailed.</p>

<p>However, and especially thanks to internet and instant communications, many people are awakening to the evils of certain big governments and big corporations that seem to be orchestrating the end goals of this original Illuminati group, weather they are the Illuminati, or just a new set of few individuals looking for absolute power over everything on this planet, even after they had accumulated vast amounts of wealth.</p>

<p>These global elite families, extended families, political puppets, etc. all want control over all monies, countries, and all aspects of us plebs on this planet full of sleeping giants that are just emerging from their deep slumber and are now awakening in much more and full force than ever before thanks to internet and instant communications.</p>

<p>People in your previous generation (if you are as young as me) may have thought masses were waking up big-time, but failed to do anything - they may just well see the greater humanity awake -right now or very soon. </p>

<p>Think of the experiment/story of the &quot;100th monkey&quot;. After nuclear bombs were tested, years later some researchers decided to put a pack of monkeys on an island that had been nuked. They taught some of the monkeys to wash radioactive coconuts in water for cleansing, because the shells above radiation. Not many monkeys did at the beginning. The monkeys that did wash them taught others, slowly building up like a curve on a data graph. It took time to kick in, but by the time the 100th monkey started washing his coconut, all of the other monkeys of the population joined into what the dissenting monkeys were doing, by washing their coconuts!</p>

<p>We are in extraordinary times right now as humans on earth. Big things seem like they may be coming. Do not feel defeated and hopeless, although how difficult it may seem. By the looks of it, the anti-humanist global elites are shitting themselves right now as they are loosing power as the general populations are waking up to their bullshit!</p>

<p>A free and prosperous human race will endure without negative interference of these anti-humanist global elites ruining everything!</p>

<p>Live long and prosper brothers/sisters!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nothing. We can never pay it back. It&#39;s pretty much impossible to do so. Most likely what trump is gonna do is inflate, and inflate away the debt. Mnuchin has already state he wants to move the debt back to 10 25 50 year, possibly 100 year instead of short term like which Clinton transitioned it over to. Fixed Intrest rates on the whole debt then inflate. He complains about others devaluing their currency and them ripping us off when they do that. He can&#39;t stop them. He&#39;s gonna do it himself. A decade of basically 0% interest with huge amounts of fiscal and monetary easing already has an inflation bubble. If the ultra rich tried to spend their money on tangibles we&#39;d have a ton of inflation.

<p>Also, nobody got suckered into voting for him. Trump supporters voted for him because of what he promised in his campaign. Guess what? He&#39;s keeping to his promises more so than any President we&#39;ve seen in modern history. He&#39;s not a career politician. He made promises and he&#39;s trying his hardest to keep them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not sure you comprehend the situation. The American &quot;democracy&quot; is broken and has been for decades, and not because evil Russians decided to expose DNC corruption. Long before Trump arrived. &quot;There is a traitor in the White House&quot; is a meaningless statement. They are all traitors. For 100 years or more the West has killed Muslims by the millions and invaded their countries in the name of oil.</p>

<p>But it is a two party system. The choice doesn&#39;t matter, except that which causes the most chaos. More of the same won&#39;t fix anything. Not voting won&#39;t do much. Voting 3rd party is equally useless, because one of the two parties will win anyway. Thus the only practical choice is Trump, and after that whatever candidate that has the best chance of winning while upsetting the most amount of people.</p>

<p>A vote for Trump is a vote for unrest, for dissatisfaction, for saying we don&#39;t want more of the same. You might say he is the same, but I don&#39;t think millions of people would have marched in the streets against the president if Hillary had won.</p>

<p>Mostly a lurker round these parts since I live on T_D but isn&#39;t this exactly the shit that as a conspiracy mod you should be against? Taking sides and telling people what to read?</p>

<p>Seriously, this is nothing but a bunch of circumstantial evidence tying in people related by only one degree of separation, this is amateurish, and Im not against it being posted, I&#39;m hugely against it being promoted. </p>

<p>I think it reflects poorly on the mods here, and hey, if you guys personally think Alex Jones is compromised thats cool, but let the rest of us draw that conclusion on our own if we want.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thats a fair response, thankyou for taking the time to articulate it. Too much of the time ppl respond emotionally and from unflinching partisan positions. Any discourse is better than throwing around insults. I keep an open mind in regards to whether or not Trump is the real deal. like if i&#39;m shown the absolute provable in court evidence (with chain of custody) Im not going to be making excuses for him.

    <div class="md"><p>Of course.</p>

<p>Your concerns on my potential bias are valid and understood. But consider it this way:</p>

<p>What would a president do who was really for the people?</p>

<p>Well he&#39;d sign an executive order authorising the US government to issue usury free currency, as opposed to purchasing dollars from the corrupt Cabal operated federal reserve.
It&#39;s really that simple.</p>

<p>Rather than pay 24-36% interest to Rothschild central bankers, <a href="http://www.michaeljournal.org/articles/politics/item/abraham-lincoln-and-john-f-kennedy">Lincoln chose to do just that.</a> </p>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>In 1972, the United States Treasury Department was asked to compute the amount of interest that would have been paid if that 400 million dollars would have been borrowed at interest instead of being issued by Abraham Lincoln. They did some computations, and a few weeks later, the United States Treasury Department said the United States Government saved 4 billion dollars in interest because Lincoln had created his own money</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>So why hasn&#39;t Trump done that? What&#39;s his excuse? The president of the United States is permitted by the constitution to issue executive orders that carry the full force of the law.
If Trump was really for the people, he&#39;d sign that order and watch the judicial review explain to the American people why they can&#39;t have debt free currency.</p>

<p>Without being grandiose at all, JFK and Lincoln were aware of the risks, but risks be damned as an honest man carrying the weight of millions with your authority. Rather than judge trump by the status quo, why not men who&#39;ve enacted tangible change? </p>

<p>But what does he do instead? Cabinet filled with Goldman. CNP. Increase in military spending. Intensities furthered in M.E. Can American afford a $54B increase in military spending?</p>

<p>I hoped Trump would be legit. He doesn&#39;t seem to be. These associations aren&#39;t trivial and I&#39;d definitely encouraged you conducting  further ancillary research around any claims I&#39;ve made. More than happy to speak on this further with you.</p>

<p>Peace </p>

    <div class="md"><p>As a devil&#39;s advocate position, why do you think they have direct and convincing evidence. According to OP rough theory, the chain of influence is something like Rothschilds-&gt;Mercers-&gt;CNP-&gt;Conway/Bannon et al.-&gt;Trump. Trump could even be largely unaware of this. Each link in the chain only needs to communicate broad policy goals, letting the lower ranks decide how to implement the details. Much of these conversations could be done in person, making intelligence difficult to produce and harder to publicize without revealing highly sensitive sources. </p>

<p>A level higher, why do you assume that the dems would want to deal a kill shot to Trump? From the merely two-party duopoly level, assuming that what democrats want individually is to be reelected, what&#39;s better than a scandalous Trump presidency? In four years, or maybe two, they get to run against Trump and all the down-ticket candidates running ads about Trump being a Russian puppet, and whatever else he does that&#39;s distasteful. As a Democratic congressman, I&#39;d feel pretty good about my seat and my personal fortunes. </p>

<p>On a level higher than this, let&#39;s say the Rothschilds/cabal/whoever are largely playing both sides. Why would they out essentially themselves, especially when this Russia narrative is working so well for them? You have the bulk of the populace polarized against each other, and no one paying attention to the hidden hands pulling both sets of strings. Plus, the Russian bogeyman has seen a resurgence as the Islamist one was losing its sheen. As an agent of the cabal, I&#39;d feel pretty good about the current situation. </p>

<p>Also, just for the record, simply having a post stickyed is not an endorsement of the content, nor a reflection of its validity; but rather a sign that the mods felt it was of high value to the community or reflected a standard of quality (with regards to its form, not content) which servers as an exemplar for posts going forward.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This post does not seem to match any of your stated criteria. In fact, it can&#39;t even get past 50 upvotes, certainly not a poor metric to factor into ones judgment in this situation, despite being among the first thing you read when coming to this sub. </p>

<p>This post contains no evidence to back up its claims, and slandering the current president is very popular on this site, although you do not see it often in this sub due to the influx of t_d users. One of the new mods shilling the thread doesn&#39;t sit well with me, either.</p>

<p>Stickying posts such as these makes this sub&#39;s users, as well as yourselves as moderators, look daft. Regardless of anyone&#39;s political affiliations, I contend that is something none of us want. </p>

<p>If you look through the comments, they&#39;re riddled with fallacies. No attempts to speak to the concrete source backed associations made. Fair enough if you disagree with the narrative but nobody&#39;s even trying to argue against the premise in the post. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yo. Shills (shareblue, ctr, or any other astroturfin&#39; ngo) are posting &quot;pro Trump&quot; to muddy the waters and plant disinformation, it&#39;s all a part of their core agenda. &quot;If you can&#39;t beat them, join them&quot;-organized infiltration and subversion. Trump could also be playing the Rothschilds we just don&#39;t have all the confirmations to know whether he actually is a patriot thru n thru or would sell out his nation and the people just like the nwo cabalists. But anyhow, even if it&#39;s all the same, this is a game of compromises sometimes. If you can&#39;t take the heat get out, find a safe space and play dough.

<p>But I don&#39;t cotton well to mods of a conspiracy subreddit telling me what to think.  I wasn&#39;t happy when it was being done to push a pro-trump agenda, and I&#39;m not happy with this either.</p>

<p>In a place like this, mods forcing things down people&#39;s throats is the <em>last</em> thing I want to see.  Balancing that agenda with the other side of the political spectrum doesn&#39;t improve much.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying you&#39;re wrong, mind.  It&#39;s pretty obvious that a lot more people whine when Trump is the one being bashed in the sticky.</p>

Random shouts of &#39;this sub is compromised&#39;, and the occasional mocking of mods that they are so inconsistent in their world-view - flipfloppers if you will on what deserves to be stickied. And how they all seem to ignore the fact that the conspiracy itself is interesting, instead attacking the content of the conspiracy.

<p>Fake news? So the reversal on Trump&#39;s Muslim ban is fake news? Flynn&#39;s resignation is fake news?

<p>Obama only signed a $800 billion stimulus package while they dove into the beast that is healthcare reform, you know, back when people were sentenced to death because they had pre-existing conditions.  </p>

<p>But that took them nearly a year to get through, they should&#39;ve been ramming it through in &lt;2 weeks so it could fail before even making it to the house floor.  You know, like the Republicans/Trump did.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t defend Trump. He&#39;s a terrible person and even more terrible president. You posted a great post, showing the leftist ties and leftist control, but by loving Trump you prove you are not objective.</p>

<p>Trump is as bad as anyone, he stole an old lady house to build a parking lot for his casino on that ground, only after expensive and long trial was she able to retain her home, in which she&#39;s lived her whole life of over 60 years. </p>

<p>He&#39;s a garbage person, he is an asshole, he is opportunistic pig, zero compassion, zero care for others!</p>

<p>He mocked a disabled reporter, he did, he made fun of him in his campaign in front of everyone. He did not attack him on his political positions which is absolutely fine, he attacked him on his misfortune, on his disability. That is a cruel and piece of trash thing to do. </p>

<p>He&#39;s treated his former wives with disdain and really poorly, he&#39;s been divorced 2 times, has had affairs while married several times. This is again just an asshole, piece of trash thing to do. </p>

<p>He&#39;s talked about his daughter Ivanka in such sexual terms, on Howard Stern over 4-5 different shows he&#39;s talked about her big tits, amazing ass, great body, model looks, on a TV interview for his campaign when asked what is the one love he shares with his daughter he said:&quot;SEX&quot;. WTF? Which father says that about him and his daughter? WTF? That is sick.</p>

<p>And that is just his garbage, filthy, character from hell. His policies are even worse than he is. He is the worst of both world. He has the worst ideas of republicans and worst ideas of democrats. </p>

<p>Hi is a big government, big spender, big military, anti immigration republican. Worst of all worlds!</p>

He&#39;s been a corrupt, heartless asshole for years in NYC and the entire city hates him. He stiffed banks and contractors numerous times to the point where he had to turn to foreign institutions. He&#39;s lied, conned and cheated the system for years. But middle America doesn&#39;t know this because they don&#39;t give two shits about New York&#39;s elites. 
He&#39;s basically the poor man&#39;s version of a rich, successful businessman. He plates everything in gold and has the most garish sense of style I&#39;ve ever seen. I mean have you see his apartment in NYC? It&#39;s basically almost satire. <a href="http://www.idesignarch.com/wp-content/uploads/Donald-Melania-Trump-Manhattan-Penthouse_1.jpg">http://www.idesignarch.com/wp-content/uploads/Donald-Melania-Trump-Manhattan-Penthouse_1.jpg</a>.

<p>All incorrect. There&#39;s sources for each claim. The YouTube video shows Alex jones shilling to hide the CNP.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s break it down further so you can just select:</p>

<p>A)the Mercer family are a Rothschild proxy?
B)Wilbur Ross worked for Rothschild inc?
C)Trump has been assisted on multiple occasions by the Rothschilds
D)CNP is controlled by Mercer?
E)CNP operates as conservative version of CFR?</p>

<p>If you agree with all of these, then what I&#39;ve posted must be a plausible narrative.</p>

<p>If you don&#39;t, then let&#39;s hear it u/kybarnet ?</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>So it becomes clear, not only is Trump controlled opposition, but the alternative media that support him, his advisers, shady conservative think tanks that produce his policy and the (sad but true) worlds most recognizable conspiracy personality are all Rothschild/ Cabal entities.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here&#39;s where it sort of breaks down. This is your main point, and yet you conclude opening with &quot;thus it becomes clear&quot;. It&#39;s a very concentrated point that doesn&#39;t have much context. Is your point that Trump / Conservative independent media is funded by &#39;Rothschild&#39;s something&#39; and NOT other or all media? It&#39;s a strange jump to essentially go through 5 series of inheritance chains of media succession without essentially include every powerful figure in the world or whatever. Is your assessment that Trump Media is the only thing controlled by Rothschild?...</p>

<p>If you had opened with your main point to start, it would have been a better post.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Rothschild were wise to deploy Mercer &amp; Ross to assist Trump over the years, they certainly seem to have acquired a prime asset in Trump, no doubt. The President of the United States is fully under Rothschild/Cabal control. A traitor is in the White House</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Pretty emotional. &quot;A Traitor&quot; is a bit of a stretch. Under your definition, aren&#39;t there like 5,000,000 traitors in the US? The rest is all conjecture. &quot;wise to deploy&quot; a &quot;prime asset&quot; &quot;no doubt&quot; &quot;under Rothschild / Cabal control&quot;... It&#39;s a lot of filler without substance.</p>

<p>Lose the hysteria and you&#39;ll write more persuasively.</p>

<p>I dot think it will</p>

<p>Jones didn&#39;t invent pedogate.</p>

<p>He only barely covered it with great reluctance.</p>

<p>He was being called out for firing Joe Biggs after he reported it.</p>

<p>All his listeners are well aware of Jones stance on pizzagate.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t focus on Comet instead look at the coded language in Podesta&#39;s emails and the links to spirit cooking.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know what or who &quot;Brock&#39;s vault dwelling virgins&quot; is meant to be, but I&#39;ve already pointed out several legitimate grievances against Jones.  Do you remember his appearance on Piers Morgan?

<p>U/Sagittariuscraig called an entire sub to brigade this post. That explains the abnormal voting patterns observed. New accounts that had never posted here before. </p>

<p>Why all the effort to derail this post? I&#39;ve havent seen tactics like this since the election.</p>

<p>Guys we need to speak up! Whether you agree with what I said or not. People are conspiring to influence your opinion. Imagine for every upvote u/Sagittariuscraig brigaded, was an upvote? How would you perceive the content you&#39;d just read? The goal is to alter your reality so you&#39;re unable to see the truth. Don&#39;t let them win.</p>

<p>A number of people from there do comment here, but this sub doesn&#39;t often talk about much other than Trump or those against him so he might have been calling the sub to promote the Mandela Effect here.</p>

<p>The Mandela Effect concept has been under heavy attack from just about everywhere to the point that even the original sub has become a troll infested swamp. The level of hate I see against it has been an eye opener. To some people it&#39;s worse than suggesting there wasn&#39;t a holocaust.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I work in insurance, 24 million don&#39;t get aca subsidies, Medicare isnt cut, it&#39;s growth is slowed, and aca shoveled as many people into Medicare as the conservative Democrats would tolerate. That&#39;s where majority of people got their insurance that benefited from aca. so that many people wouldn&#39;t lose insurance, and it wouldn&#39;t raise premiums. Even Cbo who overestimated aca benefits stated 10%drop in premiums, of course this is just a bandaid because the adverse selection problem isn&#39;t solved. You have to go full 1 rate for everyone no choice, maybe a slight variance, or completly discrinitory on everything. You cannot say a market economy, yet you cannot discriminate based on preexisting conditions. Healthy people will not get it because they are subsiding others hugely, and if your health goes bad then get insurance. Group insurance doesn&#39;t have this problem, but single market does </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Trump isn&#39;t a Rothschild asset at all, the Rothschild&#39;s are furious about Trump getting into power.</p>

<p>What&#39;s going on is actually very simple, we have Gloablists Vs Zionists, the Globalists are the ones who prioritize setting up a UN world government funded by climate taxes - Rockefeller, Rothschild, Soros are key players, Hillary, Obama etc work for them. UN and EU is all part of this agenda.</p>

<p>The Zionists are the ones who prioritize Israel-first, protecting Israel and taking control of the countries surrounding them. As long as you leave these guys alone, they won&#39;t bother you, unless you are a neighbor. Some of the top ones aren&#39;t very visible, the the more visible players are Rupert Murdoch, Breitbart, Infowars, WikiLeaks, Trump, Brexit campaign etc.</p>

<p>These guys all used to work together, but now that the globalist plan is in it&#39;s advanced stages, Soros and Co had decided that a firm hand would be needed with Israel, as otherwise nobody would trust the world government if Israel could get away with whatever they wanted. The Zionists weren&#39;t happy with the way things were going, so they&#39;ve now started to dismantle bit by bit the Globalist project for world government. That is what Brexit is about, that is what Trump is about, that is why Trump is not going along with the climate change agenda, as those taxes are to fund the Globalist world government. The Zionists have allied with nationalists, and they are fast gaining ground on the Globalists.</p>

<p>Of course, the Globalists know exactly who was trying to influence the US election using WikiLeaks etc, but nobody is allowed to say it, so instead they publicity blame Russia who actually had very little to do with it, though were pleased with the result.</p>

<p>This is an unusual moment when the Zionists are currently allied with most people on /conspiracy, everyone is needed onboard to defeat the Globalist project, it is like at the end of the film Avatar where all tribes around the planet had to unite to fight the most powerful and evil enemy of all.</p>

<p>Basically, Trump follows the &quot;globalist&quot; agenda perfectly.

<p>Meanwhile, Trump gets all of his information from Rupert Murdoch, openly pals around with Nigel Farage and Marie Le Pen, and has a daughter who takes vacations in Croatia with Murdoch&#39;s ex-wife and Putin&#39;s girlfriend. Oh yeah, and he may have collaborated with Vladimir Putin and Julian Assange to leak the DNC&#39;s e-mails.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Seems like trump is more a Rothschild asset than a foe, contrast to his stark anti-establishment, anti-globalist public outcry during his campaign. Opensecrets illustrates his campaign funders, although dark money was most definitely utilized, Hilary in actuality was given millions in US dollar from the Saudis, commercial banks, arms dealers and defense contractors. Why now is trump supporting the bankers and corporatist agenda? </p>

<hr/>

<p>I believe trump is a divide and conquer puppet. For he can create the needed resentment and outcry the globalist need. Disillusion the middle class; present false hope and intentionally have it fail while the elites scurry to cipher the last drop of oil before the environmental shift has commenced. The new world order is ripe with disillusion and controlled oppositions. </p>

<hr/>

<p>Trump is all of those things and more. HE IS THE COINTELPRO. He disillusions the middle class by siding with their worries only to reap what they suffer. He will never talk about the real enslavers of this world, if he did then we would know that he isn&#39;t a marionette. </p>

<hr/>

<p>These four years will provide the evidence needed for people to come to terms with the new world order. It will disillusion the middle class to willfully accept a new one world economic system that is controlled by the very same people that people here are against. We will accept it because it will seem appropriate and better for the greater good. But with unlimited power comes oppression. </p>

<hr/>

<p>The dems will introduce the Council on Foregin Relations member Tulsi Gabbard in 2020. This women is a controlled opposition. Of course she seems to side with reddit Conspiracy and our concerns regarding SYRIA and the NATO arming of terrorists but it&#39;s merely a PSYOP. Ask yourself why CNN continued to have her on, talking about how the U.S. Was funding ISIS? Why wasn&#39;t anyone else allowed to talk about this during the time of the weapon funneling? CNN cut off anyone who mentioned this, so why now? Please, don&#39;t fall for it anymore. Be villigant.</p>

<p>Yep, anyone not aware of all the legal nonsense surrounding this stuff: The notion is to treat the world as being owned by those handful of super-trillionaires you mentioned, and then argue that any climate activity whatsoever harms the economic interests of the trillionaires, thus they have standing in courts. They use fake science model data in court to show that new startup X produces carbon, which negatively impacts the bottom line of those preexisting massive corporations. Thus they feel like they are owed damages by the startup, and to avoid throwing a legal case against every startup, they want to just institutionalize a carbon tax that will be levied against everyone and ultimately paid to those trillionaires.</p>

<p>They literally want you to pay rent just for living in &#39;their&#39; world.</p>

<p>This isn&#39;t the first time superrich people have instituted such a scheme across multiple societies, it is just the first time climate has been used as an excuse. Normally there&#39;s some religious elements to it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ah i see. So the sum total of this submission (and by association my entire posting history has been some marketing Jedi mind trick where I do what exactly? I present sources I haven&#39;t read to produce a premise that isn&#39;t mine to impress people I dont know?</p>

<p>So where does this leave us?</p>

<p>Of course, <em>I know</em> this is laughable. But anything I say to someone whose arrived at the conclusion you have, would only serve as testament to your hypothesis. •Aha! Classic long form defense manoeuvre!* </p>

<p>So then, it seems I must disagree with you and leave you to believe what you will.</p>

<p>Comparative expertise. The post was not a magazine insert. In this forum, readers are able and welcome, should they so choose, to analyze that which is proffered, and to submit arguments in rebuttal.</p>

<p>Are they not?</p>

<p>SUCCESSFUL people who work in marketing know that most sales are NOT made by appealing to logic, reason, and thoughtful consideration, but to the baser instincts of emotion, impulse and appeals to the innate desire to be accepted as part of the &quot;in-group&quot; - the &quot;cool people&quot;.</p>

<p>That&#39;s why <strong><em>SUCCESSFUL people who work in marketing</em></strong> can get away with selling worthless concoctions that are <em>&quot;guaranteed to make you lose 30 pounds in 30 days&quot;</em> or grow you an irresistible &quot;TWELVE INCH PENIS!&quot;. </p>

<p>In modern marketing, logic smells, and bullshit sells... which is why you tried to counter OP&#39;s referenced argument with BULLSHIT.</p>

<p>AMIRITE?</p>

<p>No, but you used the word &quot;fraud&quot; or at least insinuated it. You have made zero effort to address the central point in my post- merely spoke to the tone of the argument. Rather than employ the same fallacy (or another) can you state what exactly it is that you disagree with?</p>

<p>Close. &quot;Evil offers the illusion of fighting itself to create false divisions for us to rally behind&quot;</p>

<p>Divide and Conquer is a good way, but a better way would be to say &quot;the conqeuered stay conquered when divided&quot;</p>

<p>By creating synthetic dialogues between both sides of the political spectrum (which they control CFR- Council Foreign Relations|CNP it matters not whose elected, as both sides inevitably enact policy that will achieve same outcomes. You saw before the election how Clinton camp conspired to elevate Trump as pied piper candidate to weaken the field? The media is easily manipulated as we know. Fuelling Trump angst at this point only serves to deepen the divisions the election fermented. More divisions - less unity. More confirmation bias to increase Trumps credibility &quot;they&#39;re attacking him so he must be legit&quot;</p>

<p>How exactly? Has Trump signed an executive order to give the federal government the power to issue debt free currency? No.You&#39;re aware the Federal reserve is a cabal bank that sells Dollars to US government with interest? Lincoln saved America $400B during the short live experiment with the  Greenbacks issued to fight the civil war. Rather than pay interest on loans from Central bankers (of which Rothschilds were amongst them) and cripple the people with debt, he had the conviction to do what was right. As did JFK. </p>

<p>Trump signals his alliances when he fills his cabinet with Goldman. Is surrounded by CNP. Propped up in alternative media by CNP ((Rothschild)) and raises military spending by $54B whilst Americans struggle.
<strong>Can America afford a $54B increase in military spending?</strong></p>

<p>I could enumerate a litany of things trump would do if he wasn&#39;t a continuation of the corruption that&#39;s passed for POTUS since JFK. Trump has not shown he&#39;s for the people, so I&#39;m not for him.</p>

As you said divide and conquer this thread could also be said the same and be a false narrative to turn us against a man who is on our side. If he is working for Rothschild then why he is purposely helping America grow by helping it get higher wage jobs and his plan is to create 14.5 million more jobs in the US? As I said his actions contradict everything you suggest and what Rothschild wants unless they changed their mind. </p>

<p>Other things to note Trump mentioned about getting rid of the federal reserve. Also for Goldman Sachs unless we have more info you can&#39;t say he is working for Rothschild. The Republican party could am have forced him to have them like they forced Reagan to have Bush as his VP or these Goldmen Each individuals have turned or be convinced to help humanity than do what Rothschild wants and have went rogue against Rothschild. </p>

<p>In the 1930s, the Western press heavily criticized Hitler. The result was a war that made billions (trillions in todays dollars) for the war profiteers and central bankers. Note that I&#39;m not saying Trump is Hitler—I find those arguments facile—I&#39;m saying that wars and conflicts make huge sums of money for certain people, and that using the press to demonize a willing or unwilling agent can be hugely beneficial to that end. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying OP is in on it, maybe he was just taken by the wave. Anyway, it&#39;s interesting topic, but these methods are tiresome.</p>

<p>You&#39;re right - to a degree.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been following Mercer since I saw him discussed in the sub yes. Didn&#39;t start digging into him in any depth until I saw the Religious Liberty bill gaining traction at start of March. The bill seemed so obviously at odds with Obamas policy it seemed a deliberate attempt to provoke an already divide populace. Strategies of division are Cabal calling cards, seeing the CNP at the heart of the bill should ring alarm bells when you dwell a bit on its financing. </p>

<p>Is what I&#39;ve presented 100% bonafide fact? No, in my current station in life, I&#39;d never possess the means verify that. What I&#39;ve presented are associates in the public record of what appears to suggest nefarious intent. Disputing the premise on its merits, varies from outright denial the associations exists. The former is a discussion I&#39;m happy to have, the latter? Not so much.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We&#39;re getting a lot of complaints for this being a sticky, and I thought I&#39;d share my reasons for voting for it to be stickied:</p>

<p>First, I think it represents a viewpoint that has not been adequately discussed on this sub. The MSM has been pumping out the message that Trump is in bed with Putin since the election, and so far I&#39;ve seen no conclusive proof to that end. Yet this post specifically goes into details of members of Trump&#39;s administration that are members of CNP and closely associated with the Mercer family, notably Bannon and Conway. This is not speculation; this is in the public record. </p>

<p>So what does that have to do with anything? I wouldn&#39;t say that Trump is &quot;owned&quot; by CNP or the Rothschilds at this point, but I find it very important to examine who&#39;s influencing his administration at the policy and PR levels. Even if you are of the belief that Trump is genuine and wishes to drain the swamp, shouldn&#39;t you be concerned with what organizations have sway within his inner circle? Perhaps you should be even more concerned than an anti-Trumper, because such an organization could derail any meaningful reforms that Trump would want to enact as President. </p>

<p>I think it&#39;s important to view the world and the US political sphere in a nuanced and non-black-and-white manner. Political organizations and parties are not monolithic, and nor are their interests always at odds with each other. There are layers upon layers of deception built into the very system. One useful tool in peeling back these layers is to see who&#39;s affiliated with whom and how tightly. An affiliation does not in itself demonstrate shared goals or ideology, but it can inform it. This post lays out some affiliations that are not often discussed in either the pro-Trump or anti-Trump camps. And it should be of some concern even to the anti-Trumpers that the media is dwelling on the ephemeral Russia connection while ignoring CNP almost altogether. </p>

<p>Finally, a word on Alex Jones. I think it was a somewhat poor choice to begin the post with him, and he&#39;s a bit of a red herring in this discussion. Sure, if the CNP connection is valid and pertinent, then his refusal to discuss it at length makes him look culpable, but most people on this sub already have their mind made up about him one way or another. If he is disinfo, then we can expect ~90% of what he says to be true(ish), so him ignoring CNP does not necessarily give us any more than prima facie evidence anyway. My takeaway re: AJ is that we shouldn&#39;t rely on one source, even if they&#39;ve had good results in the past. We need to be aware of their blind spots. </p>

Beyond the sheep-pens of the believers in mythologies, there exist two fundamentally opposed views of what to do with the world, of what direction to adopt in steering the historical movement of the human species. One elite, the humanists, the Pla- tonic or Neoplatonic faction, is dedicated to steering the course of history away from rule through mythologies. The other, the /_ristotelians and their heirs, is corn- mitted to strengthening the rule by mythology, for the purpose of establishing a permanent, &quot;feudal-like&quot; utopia of obedient, simple-minded folk ruled by a ten- ured neo-Aristotelian oligarchy.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>Elements of the the humanists (Neoplatonic) were the architects of the American revolution. Black Guelph (Neo Aristotelian) - are the oligarchical faction, that&#39;s ruled us since time immemorial. Their current centre is the British monarchy.</p>

<p>I&#39;d highly recommend reading the article I linked. Larouche JR is a very unique source - check his bio out, very illuminating.</p>

<p>Trapped in the myth of duality. Can you see how limiting a perspective that is? Ok imagine the false dichotomy really does exist. You win...how exactly?By uniting with &quot;right&quot; to defeat &quot;left&quot;?</p>

<p>What is the goal? To vanquish your opponent? What then. These are your neighbours- surely it&#39;s more prudent to look past synthetic divisions to realise <em>they</em> are against - <em>not us vs each other</em>.
These illusions have been designed to keep you looking <em>here</em>. But whilst you&#39;re focused on &quot;the other side&quot; - military spending just went up $54B.</p>

<p>Cabinet filled to bursting with Goldman. Increased intensities fighting CIA-ISIS in Middle East. Can America afford to continue in the same vein after 8 years of single digit growth? </p>

<p>These associations are present and cannot be ignored. If you disagree with the narrative I&#39;ve presented, then that&#39;s another thing altogether. But don&#39;t say you&#39;re fine with Rothschild influence permeating so pervasively into the the presidency. </p>

<p>I am no Alex Jones fan but this actually has nothing to do with Alex Jones.  There is a clear organized hit taking place right now.  They got AJ to denounce PG, Youtube got it trending in their top 25, simultaneously the sub is flooded with anti-AJ posts.  Yes, this is such obvious organized CTR-style disinformation.  Whenever you see someone screaming &quot;CNP CNP&quot; you know they are a CTR shill.  The whole &quot;CNP&quot; nonsense was dreamed up by David Brock and his toxic disgusting hoards of paid shills that infect reddit and r/politics. </p>

<p>Now that infection has now spread into the moderation team of r/conspiracy</p>

<p><em>THE MODS RESPONSIBLE FOR VOTING STICKYING AND VOTING FORT THAT STICKY NEED TO IMMEDIATELY BE REMOVED FROM THIS SUB</em></p>

<p>These scum will bring down the last open discussion forum that is r/conspiracy.  The last bastion for uncontrolled opposition to globalist world order.  They have shown their true colors by taking part in the organized propaganda.</p>

<p>This is evidence they are getting their orders from somewhere outside the sub and that they are here to disrupt the narrative.</p>

<p><strong>OUT OUT OUT</strong> with these mods</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry, but incorrect. It&#39;s the same family.</p>

<p>Mercers father was <a href="http://m.institutionalinvestor.com/Article.aspx?ArticleId=3646526"> Thomas Mercer. His father, a scientist whose research at Albuquerque’s Lovelace Foundation for Medical Education and Research</a> was funded by Atomic Energy Commission.</p>

<p>Have you heard of the <em>Baruch Plan</em>? Tl:dr It was a proposal for One World Government  delivered from US government to Stalin in 1946, created by Bernard Baruch &amp; David Lilienthal (known Rothschild agent but more importantly - <strong>Head of The Atomic Energy Commission</strong>)
 Lord Viktor Rothschild had a keen focus on the plan as part of Israels &quot;Peace Movement&quot; and plans  to secure nuclear capability.</p>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>This &quot;Baruch Plan&quot; was canvassed in the issues of 1946 and put to Stalin. By the end of that year, Stalin had rejected it, on the grounds that it required submission to Washington, and the Cold War had begun.</p>

<p>The Mercers and Rothschilds have been working together for some time. Follow the money and names.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, most of our politicians are corrupted individuals. Wholly bought out. This is news to you? 
You see Trumps attacks as testament to his credibility, yes? But you know from wikileaks how Trump was elevated as a pied piper candidate with Clinton supplied-media focus?
There are factions within the elite. Clearly Hillary was the hot favourite, so most threw in with her. It seems the Rothschild hedged their bets with Trump (as they&#39;re known to do) and picked a winner. 
If anyone&#39;s playing 4d chess, it&#39;s them. Ross bailed Trump out in 1990. Mercer Family has been backing him for last couple years.
Rothschild money and influence wherever you look. This post left out Roy Kohn. Epstein, as I wanted to keep it fairly simple. But those guys are pedophile blackmail artist who operate under Zionist orders (Rothschild/Cabal). Yet more troubling associations. At some point they stop being coincidences. </p>

<p>Let&#39;s break it down further so you can just select:</p>

<p>A)the Mercer family are a Rothschild proxy?
B)Wilbur Ross worked for Rothschild inc?
C)Trump has been assisted on multiple occasions by the Rothschilds
D)CNP is controlled by Mercer?
E)CNP operates as conservative version of CFR?</p>

I see. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5jq201/high_level_insider_explains_terrorism/?st=J0QOIUJV&amp;amp;sh=29e1d4f4">This</a> might help allay concerns that I&#39;m somehow in cahoots with the mods. They took down another 7 after that. Take a look through the comments to see people saying the exact things you&#39;ll read across this post:</p>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The mods are compromised </p>

<p>Although I admit I don&#39;t browse conspiracy a whole lot I have never seen a sticky post that takes a political side.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>Me neither, and I&#39;m on here a lot. I had no idea the post would be tagged until it was. Having observed the sub over the last year, my guess is the mods took a decision to swing the sub back towards its origins after it began to look like the _Donald2.
Was tagging my (admittedly very decisive) post the best way to accomplish that? In some ways. Something Of this ilk needed to happen- were a community of free thinkers- loyal to each other - not the throne. But at the same time I understand how so many have bought into trump. Hope is a powerful thing and can be manipulated by those who&#39;d seek to quell a rising tide. I understand why some may have been offended to find a partisan community taking sides. Difficult decision either way, never going to please everyone. In that instance, one must stay true to their character and act from their conscience. Which they seem to have done.</p>

If you had a brain, you could see just what Trump and Alex Jones have done for the people&#39;s movement for quite sometime now, it negates whatever fallacies you are digging up.

I bet if given enough time, anyone in the world can be connected to the Rothschilds, you do realize they own or are affiliated with 90% of all the companies in the world.

    <div class="md"><p>False again. </p>

<p>Here&#39;s an example:</p>

<p>&quot;As is Bannon. Conway. Erik Prince of blackwater fame. Oliver North. Iran Contra. Cocaine running under Bush. So we see the same necons of Bush cabinet, behind Trump this time around. Breitbart was founded by the Mercer family..&quot;</p>

<p>You lazily rattle off incomplete sentences and then the sources to which you link don&#39;t even provide justification for whatever it is you&#39;re trying to assert. </p>

<p>Another example: you say Alex Jones is &quot;gatekeeping for CNP,&quot; and as a source you link to an entire YouTube video which shows nothing of the sort. </p>

<p>You are lazily asserting things and refusing to provide any precise detail. </p>

<p>Attempts to popularize the notion that Trump is a Rothschild or an insider working for Soros cannot work in principle, since we are exposed to literally hundreds of articles per day constituting attacks on him by that very establishment. </p>

<p>So, try something else. </p>

<p>You cannot just speak loose conspiracy theorist-lingo and expect it to fool anyone. You are incompetent because you don&#39;t realize most of the population has a fundamental distrust of anything reported by the media now. </p>

<p>IF you really want to discredit Trump, you should have the media start supporting whatever he does.  </p>

<p>As for trying it online, you are in an even worse situation. Most of the people, particularly on this sub and others, will pick apart the claims and analyze for truth or falsity. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have never understood why exactly people believe Trump is on the side of the people.  For one his very rhetoric and many past actions in the business world show a clear lack of compassion and empathy - which is a telltale sign of a sociopath /psychopath. That alone should be enough to question Trump &#39;s legitimacy (I personally do not trust people who visibly lack compassion), but even without that it just seems crazy to me that someone that is not an inside man could somehow become the US president - one of the most powerful public positions on this planet! (When the voting can be so easily rigged in a variety of ways) </p>

<p>His actions, even now,  are pointing to him obviously not being on the side of the populace - his appointments of Wall Street insiders and members of the elite to government positions should say enough about his true intentions.  And don&#39;t even get me started on Jones...the most fearmongering individual in the &quot;truth&quot; movement....</p>

<p>I do still feel however that Trump &#39;s movement has inadvertently awakened many people, so in a way good has been done,  especially if some of those that have seen beyond the veil look deeper and see past the divisions incited by his campaign (especially left / right when it comes to politics) .</p>

<p>The way to fight the elites is fundamentally compassion and empathy. If the people are not divided, afraid and pitted against each other in hate and anger they will become free at last. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Bernie is not a communist.
On the American political spectrum he&#39;s left center, in Europe he&#39;s centrist:
<a href="https://www.politicalcompass.org/images/usprimaries2016.png">https://www.politicalcompass.org/images/usprimaries2016.png</a></p>

<p>(Ignore Trump on this scale for now, since he keeps flip flopping and lying, it&#39;s hard to tell
where on the spectrum he really is, only time will tell if he&#39;s a NEOcon or more centrist)</p>

<p>The &quot;Bernie&#39;s a commie&quot; is political bullshit from the corporate media (INCLUDING CNN).
It&#39;s like calling Trump a fascist. Even that&#39;s not true.
But he&#39;s definitely been corrupt before, hence his ties to the mafia, gaming the system financially and dodging tax, and other real controversies. He&#39;s even flip flopped on drug prices (therefore he&#39;s now kissing big pharma&#39;s ass).
It&#39;s a joke to claim he&#39;s &quot;always been anti-corruption&quot;.
Come on.
I give Trump the benefit of the doubt for now but to claim he&#39;s squeeky clean is ridiculous.
He has his own agendas. 
Unfortunately they also might include the zionist one since he&#39;s friendly with Breitbart and Netanyahu and kissing Israel&#39;s ass all the time at everyone else&#39;s expense.</p>

<p>You need to question everything before solidifying your opinion on politics.
You just assumed the media was telling the truth about Bernie being a &quot;communist&quot;
and you didn&#39;t fact check it yourself from a variety of sources.
You need to be more careful.</p>

<p>Trump&#39;s only a lesser evil compared to Clinton and that&#39;s not impressive at all.
Bernie and Jill Stein are the real anti-establishment.
Why was Bernie ignored while zionist Trump given over $2 billion worth of free advertising from
the corporate media (CNN, FOX NEWS, MSNBC, etc.) ?
The establishment preferred Hillary but Trump isn&#39;t exactly a wrench in their plan.
Bernie would actually have rocked the boat.</p>

<p>If you want your taxes to go to things that ACTUALLY benefit you
like universal health care, affordable or free college, better infrastructure, etc.
instead of wars in the middle east for the bankers, then you should have voted Bernie.
But the DNC rigged the primaries.
The democrats AND republicans are both right wing authoritarians.
The bankers who want an NWO one world government are fascist wannabes.
This current NEOlib/NEOcon system is just a few steps away from fascism.
Moving leftward is not a bad idea considering capitalism is fucking up without
adequate socialism.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a ratio remember and right now, the balance has tipped so far to the capitalism side
that millions are in poverty, homeless, struggling, etc.
If you let the red scare bullshit you into getting
scared of all leftism, then you&#39;re a lost cause and easily manipulated.
Obamacare isn&#39;t even left wing, it&#39;s privatized, meaning it&#39;s RIGHT WING.
Insurance companies and big pharma benefit from that.
And we had idiot right wingers (especially republican worshippers)
claiming Obama was a socialist! LOOOOL.
Obama is a NEOlib like Clinton.
NEOlib/NEOcon, it&#39;s the same globalist right wing authoritarian bullshit that screws over
the workers.
I highly recommend not getting confused with political labels
(until you learn basic political science from multiple sources and judge fr yourself)
and instead just read his policies and ask around the Bernie sub for answers to any questions you have.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As a &#39;left wing&#39; Green Party, Bernie Sanders supporting foreign libertarian socialist type person, this whole post is both redundant and unclear. Redundant in that people are already aware he is a billionaire president, and shares the interests of the richest people on the planet. Unclear in that you&#39;re making massive leaps of logic.  Simply being super rich, corrupt, in bed with fossil fuel industries, etc does not make him completely in control of a Cabal, or a specific rich family. Maybe he is, but you&#39;ve certainly not supported that allegation with this stickied post.  </p>

<p>This post reminds me of a certain Democratic Party strategy, where allegations are made without proof, thereby weakening the legitimacy of any critique itself.<br/>
IMO if this were not stickied we would not be here talking about it. No revelations at all. Perhaps I&#39;m being too harsh, considering how many t_d supporters show up here.<br/>
The question should be: Why is it a problem that the richest trillionaires are still in charge of the government? The debate should be ideological, that is where real change can occur. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Of course, I touched on the subject further down the post:</p>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The Elite factions are divided into Humanist, who follow Platonic teachings &amp; black Guelph/Mystery Babylon - Aristotle ](<a href="http://wlym.com/archive/campaigner/7806.pdf">http://wlym.com/archive/campaigner/7806.pdf</a>) </p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>There are secret societies ((mystery schools)) on both sides of the coin - as you may have noticed, the bad guys ie- Oligarchy - are winning. There are however, lesser discussed factions who have worked for millennia to instil humanist policies, through application of the Platonic method. Understanding their mythology, will help to illuminate how they contrast and how these beliefs manifest:</p>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Beyond that first broad level of division_between the knowledgeable and the credulous, the secret knowledge is distinguished by the division of elites into two irreconcilable factions. Beyond the sheep-pens of the believers in mythologies, there exist two fundamentally opposed views of what to do with the world, of what direction to adopt in steering the historical movement of the human species. One elite, the humanists, the Platonic or Neoplatonic faction, is dedicated to steering the course of history away from rule through mythologies. The other, the Aristotelians and their heirs, is corn- mitted to strengthening the rule by mythology, for the purpose of establishing a permanent, &quot;feudal-like&quot; utopia of obedient, simple-minded folk ruled by a tenured neo-Aristotelian oligarchy.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>The humanists (Neoplatonic) were the architects of the American revolution. Black Guelph (Neo Aristotelian/Mystery Babylon) - are the oligarchical faction, that&#39;s ruled us since time immemorial. Their current centre is the British monarchy.</p>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>During most of the past 2,500 years, oligarchs have been identified by their support for the philosophical writings of Aristotle and their rejection of the epistemology of Plato. Aristotle asserted that slavery is a necessary institution, because some are born to rule and others to be ruled. He also reduced the question of human knowledge to the crudest sense certainty and perception of &quot;facts.&quot; Aristotle&#39;s formalism is a means of killing human creativity, and therefore represents absolute evil. This evil is expressed by the bestialist view of the oligarchs that human beings are the same as animals.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s a guy with a lot of money and extreme political leanings.
He finances politicians who implement the policies he likes.
He funds a major think tank that articulates and disperses his agenda.
He&#39;s the financial backing to a platform that&#39;s come to be synonymous with the movement he essentially created. 
His two advisers work closely across a number of family projects.</p>

<p>This is all before Trump. </p>

<p>Mercer was backing Cruz initially, but threw in with Trump after Cruz&#39;s dismal primary run. Everything you see from that point is Mercer. Breitbart became Trumps personal news network. Cambridge Analytics, Mercers election influencing analytics firm, joined Bannon and Conway to work on Trumps campaign. <em>Bye Ted!</em> Only $13.5M lost on his campaign. Small change in the long run.. and short run I guess. During the election revelation of the corrupt dealings of the <em>Clinton Foundation</em> was a considerable discomfort for her campaign. Widely viewed documentary &quot;Clinton Cash&quot;,  detailed numerous conflicts of interest between the Clintons family foundation and their government service. The organisation that produced it &quot;Government Accountability Institute&quot; was funded by Bannon with Mercer finances.Bear in mind the book was released while Mercer was still backing Cruz. It wasn&#39;t till the support switched to Trump that the documentary was premiered at the Cannes film festival.</p>

<p>Trumps run to the White House: policies, smear campaigns, advisers, platform- were in place long before he was. He&#39;s essentially a front for Robert Mercer, is he not? 
Think about this: if Mercer has enough sway over Trump to place his family assets in charge of his campaign: why would you believe any of Trumps cabinets picks were his?</p>

<p>Does Mercer just fall back at this point? Having literally done everything behind the scenes to support a successful Presidential campaign, he just hands the keys to Donald and lets him get on with it? How plausible does that seem. </p>

<p>Sorry, I couldn&#39;t resist.  This just reminds me too much of Soros.  How many more Victor von Doom impersonators are there out there, that nobody has ever heard of, I wonder?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just pointed out to another poster the gulf in policy on Israel between breitbart, the nyt ilk, and the Trump administration. No offense, but your theory fails. Another alternative is that Cruz was the last chance to take out the Trump wild card. That theory, my theory, holds up just fine. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If this is true then all humanity is fucked. There is no hope because you&#39;d have to be brainless to think the Clinton&#39;s were any better. If this is true and Trump doesn&#39;t really want to help America then basically the masses are caught in a war of elite psychopaths trying to control the world of their greedy selves. If this is true then we have all been conned and manipulated by even probably the same groups that supported Clinton. Basically there&#39;s absolutely nothing anyone could do.</p>

<p>Some people saw Trump as their last hope to save humanity from so corruption. Some people believe the elites have not only monopolized all media to try to control the minds of the masses, but are now paying people and organizations to go on websites like Reddit to make fake posts full anti trump propaganda. </p>

<p>People are mostly pretty set in their beliefs. I hate to admit it, but I am one of those people that find it extremely difficult to trust MSM and Reddit nowadays. If Trump and Alex Jones really are evil and working with the elites... that&#39;s a hard thought to process or bring to light in my mind and probably many of my fellow conspiracy theorists. Mainly because of this is true then like I said in my first paragraph. We are all fucked. There is no good side. There is no one in a significant position of power to help save the planet from corruption. If this was true the what&#39;s the point of caring anymore?</p>

<p>Frankly, this post gives no solutions. If Trump is evil and corrupt, are you suggesting Hillary was a better choice? You&#39;re not going to convince any real people on this sub this is true. </p>

<p>Your post, if true, only truly says one thing to me. We&#39;re all fucked so stop giving a shit about anything and have fun. Enjoy life. While we still have it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s a guy with a lot of money and extreme political leanings.
He finances politicians who implement the policies he likes.
He funds a major think tank that articulates and disperses his agenda.
He&#39;s the financial backing to a platform that&#39;s come to be synonymous with the movement he essentially created. 
His two advisers work closely across a number of family projects.</p>

<p>This is all before Trump. </p>

<p>Mercer was backing Cruz initially, but threw in with Trump after the formers dismal primary run. Everything you see from that point is Mercer. Breitbart became Trumps personal news network. Cambridge Analytics, Mercers election influencing analytics firm, joined Bannon and Conway to work on Trumps campaign. <em>Bye Ted!</em> Only $13.5M lost on his campaign. Small change in the long run.. and short run I guess. During the election revelation  of <em>Clinton Foundation</em>&#39;s corrupt dealings was a source of considerable discomfort for her campaign. Widely viewed documentary &quot;Clinton Cash&quot;,  detailed numerous conflicts of interest between the Clintons family foundation and their government service. The organisation that produced it &quot;Government Accountability Institute&quot; was funded by Bannon with Mercer finances.Bear in mind the book was released while Mercer was still backing Cruz. It wasn&#39;t till the support switched to Trump that the documentary was premiered at the Cannes film festival.
Mercer attended on his yacht - Sea<a href="http://www.traditioninaction.org/religious/f032_Owl.htm">Owl</a> </p>

<p>Trumps run to the White House: policies, smear campaigns, advisers, platform- were in place long before he was. He&#39;s essentially a front for Robert Mercer, is he not? 
Think about this: if Mercer has enough sway over Trump to place his family assets in charge of his campaign: why would you believe any of Trumps cabinets picks were his?</p>

<p>Does Mercer just fall back at this point? Having literally done everything behind the scenes to support a successful Presidential campaign, he just hands the keys to Donald and lets him get on with it? How plausible does that seem. </p>

<p>Everything you&#39;ve read is independently verifiable. Your request for &quot;proof&quot; is illogical as you know it can never be fulfilled. Your decision to support Trump was made with the same &quot;proof&quot; that&#39;s been presented in the post -media sources, why isn&#39;t that enough now? Both sides are owned, that&#39;s always been the case. Trump is no different.</p>

But this is nonsense, yes Robert Mercer funded brietbart news from the beginning as well as the investigative journalists that outed Hillary. He also is apparently maybe acquainted with a Rothschild but he was a software programmers that wrote and got rich off a candlesticking type stock price prediction software. All the connections between him and Trump are well known, him and his daughter were he first to take full advantage of citizens united and pretty much bought this election.

With him coming out against the Freedom Caucus with the slimeball Paul Ryan, I&#39;m starting to have my doubts.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think the EU is anything but a ploy to keep the monetary system under the thumb of the iron bank. But the dynamics of the monetary system are rapidly changing. The EU is crumbling while countries like Italy, Spain and Greece are selling off assets in order to stave off defaults.</p>

<p>The inevitability of an EU collapse was always part of the playbook. That money eventually had to go back to the banks.</p>

<p>Why would they want to support someone that is blatantly anti-NWO and wants to disassemble the European Union which is the Rothschilds &quot;dream&quot; long term project?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because the rules of the game have changed. Strong EU and strong euro currency is not wished for anymore. Unless a miracle happens, the US dollar will soon end its life as &quot;reserve currency,&quot; see the graphics <a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2013-10-13/guest-post-how-much-longer-will-dollar-be-reserve-currency">here</a> and read about the life-cycle of world reserve currencies <a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2014-08-14/world-reserve-currencies-what-happened-during-previous-periods-transition">here</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The reserve currency transition is a cycle that has typically lasted in history somewhere between 80 to 110 years. Officially, the US dollar has been the reserve currency for 68 years. However, the US dollar was used in trade much before, since the 1920s, in fact. That would put the US dollar closer to 90+ years as the reserve currency.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It has happened many times before. &quot;They&quot; cycle through countries about once every hundred years. When the debt is unbearably high, &quot;they&quot; crash the system and move on to the next country. Parasites.</p>

<p>Once again and slowly: unless an economic miracle happens, the US dollar is going to crash down. Trump might have been hired to do exactly that.</p>

<p>Democrats have strategically done their best to keep as many black people in poverty as possible. Intentionally breaking up families, promoting/condoning and CREATING &quot;thug culture&quot;, incentivizing young girls to have kids with no father. The democrats never stopped being the racist KKK party, they just got sneaker about it. </p>

<p>When Trump won and the first policy outline he released was &quot;New Deal for Black America&quot;, reading it and seeing that he was planning on addressing damn near every sneaky bullshit that the democrats have put in place since the 60s (Fuck LBJ), I honestly teared up. I felt like such a pussy but, knowing that he saw the problems, intended on trying to fix them and would inevitably catch hell and be labeled a &quot;racist&quot; for even trying. I.e Forcing banks to stop denying black people business loans. </p>

<p>Hell, he&#39;s already given 5x more money to historical black colleges than our previous president. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Practically speaking, just look at where most of the wealth in the Western word is concentrated, particularly the US. Nearly all the media in the world is owned by Jews. Rothschild family alone owns nearly every central bank in the world. The US will send $38 billion in military aid to Israel over the next 10 years. Zionists exert their power way beyond Israeli borders. Israel holds significant power over US foreign policy. It also enforces legal crackdown on Israel-protesters in Western countries.</p>

<p>While dealings with Russians seems like petty incompetent corruption from the Trump camp, he is beholden to the Heritage Foundation, the Zionists, Saudi Arabia, the military industrial complex, the bankers, big pharma, big oil, etc. All this is clear from just looking at his actions in his first 100 days in office. </p>

<p>Even if the Soros Deep State is out to get him so the left can finally install sharia law in the US (xenophobia worked wonders for him during the 2016 elections), Trump is an incompetent swindler beholden to his own set of handlers. The Russia thing is juicier because he could even be under blackmail from a Russian Honey Trap.</p>

<p>All I see is a shitty failed replacement plan he co-authored that pretty much embodied all the fake lies the paid corporate shill politicians said about Obamacare and Trump pointing fingers at Ryan for taking all the blame when people realised how shit it was. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wait - Obama &quot;fucked up the healthcare industry&quot; AND he also didn&#39;t make it worse than it was before? You can&#39;t have it both ways. Sounds like you just don&#39;t like Obama because feelings.</p>

<p>And eventually, it ended up with their being a piece in The Wall Street Journal where Magerman spoke out about what Bob Mercer thinks politically. And it had been very hard for people outside of the firm to know what Bob Mercer&#39;s agenda was and why he was getting so involved in politics. And Magerman kind of spilled the beans.</p>

<p>He said that Mercer wanted to shrink the government to the size of a pinhead and that he doesn&#39;t think that - he basically has a philosophy, according to Magerman, that values people on the basis of what they earn. He doesn&#39;t think human beings have intrinsic value. He thinks that if you are a schoolteacher and you earn 2 million times less than Mercer earns, then you&#39;re 2 million times less valuable than Mercer is. And he believes that if you are on welfare, you have negative value. And what Magerman said was, and he&#39;s not talking about economically. He means as a human being.</p>
