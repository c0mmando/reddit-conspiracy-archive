       if the public knew the earth was flat, the scientific establishment would collapse instantly, NASA would shut down, angry mobs would demand what the government did with the billions of tax dollars that went to fund NASA, people will ask "if they lied to us about the shape of the earth what else did they lie about?"
      </p>
      <p>
       more importantly the religious would have all the proof that the earth indeed has a Creator. they will say their beliefs have been proven 100% and will demand all authority. Nations will turn into theocracies and all opposition to religion will be dealt with seriously.
      </p>
      <p>
       The elite know earth is flat and they also know what will happen if the truth was disclosed. thats why they are scared shitless and that's why they are covering up the true shape of the earth.

       the issue is
      </p>
      <p>
       1) people thought the earth was flat hundred of years ago, pre NASA and scientific establishment existed.
      </p>
      <p>
       2) Nations were pretty much theocracies pre modern times..
      </p>
      <p>
       this doesn't make sense.. if flat earth were truth, why would people go from truth = lie.

       Gotta correct you, the Aztecs believed it to be flat and they were in the centre of it. But they were also in a city in a lake in the mountains in a desert, so they didn't know much outside of that.

       Yea that's better. I'm not even saying the earth
       <em>
        couldn't
       </em>
       be flat, I have no idea if it's round, flat, oblong or dickbutt- shaped (wouldn't that be fun) and I'm open to hearing the reasoning behind all of those ideas. I just think we should tackle the Alien conspiracy first and then we can bug them about the shape of the planet.

       1) Why not go ahead and link whatever youre getting at.
       <br/>
       2)  Just because we can predict something with a formula doesnt mean we understand even the slightest thing about its origin, or
       <em>
        why
       </em>
       its so.  There are too many examples to list.  Furthermore, conjecture usually inappropriately attaches itself to good maths.  For instance, special relativity has a good basis in math, but insanely terrible explanations surrounding it.
      </p>
      <p>
       What ... are
       <em>
        you
       </em>
       in college / grad school or something, in the midst of your indoctrination?
      </p>
      <p>
       If you had to ask me or anyone with an open mind, big bang is a pretty poor model, when all assumptions are truly understood and taken into account.  Id say the same of quantum physics (and relativity) even though ive taken courses and am aware of the predictive powers of both (I have been officially indoctrinated, that is)
      </p>
      <p>
       If youd like I can explain why I say what I say.  But if you dig it into yourself, the poor assumptions should also be pretty clear, given youve an analytical mind, not too whacked by modern scientism's gospel.

       Ok lets preemptively give up treating Joes rabies diagnosis because we dont know if he got bit by a bat, dog, or ate some bad meat. We can predict Joes grim future from the thousands of historical data points and using the satanic powers of germ theory...but its all usless and all data is presumed falsified , just ignore that it has PREDICTIVE power by powers of magnitude,  way way WAY beyond any subjective egocentric  1500 Aristotelian worldview.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also look at your cell phone again and be afraid of it. It shouodnt be working.. all those trillions of electrons behaving in extremly predictable way in the far far future .even a year from now, when you turn your phone on..all those trillions of electrons will still behave AS PREDICTED BY QUANTUM MECHANICS.....the most validated, tested, measured branch of science in history by literaly orders of magnitude...
      </p>
      <p>
       Unless you can come up with a MORE USEFUL MODEL that can PREDICT THE FUTURE by a fine accuracy of better than .00000000000000000000001 like QM can.
The real consiracy is a pathological ego dismissing the work and history of ten thousand people smarter than you or I , who have spent lifetimes and careers investigating and falsifying hypothesis, gathering data, building and useing measuring tools that work....all the evidence you need is shown in the success of technology..applied science..
Instead just dismiss with a wave of your hand while providing NO PREDICTABLE MODEL that works better.

       Quantum mechanics isnt obligated to make sense intuitively or human sense to be correct and validated. Our commonsense is hopelessly flawed because we only intuitivly know our own time and space scales  that we live in.
 I think youre complaining more about popcultural popularizations and explinations of science(specificly those areas of the very large and very small) that tries to make analogies to understand without the math. Like when we all conceptualize an atom  and electrons as balls orbiting around a central mass in perpetual motion....because thats the image from high school textbooks....but is grossly inaccurate, simplistic and does  not really describe the phenomena or make any  logical sense if you analyze the drawing too long. But anyone who knows physics beyond feel good movies about superstrings will tell you to toss out all preassumptions about understanding QM. Even Feynman said you dont understand QM if you think you understand it.

       The real scientists admit they are in a state of no knowledge about the explanation .... yes, yes some powerful predictions have been made.  But please keep mind that sometimes, we actually cant make predictions and must use statistics.

       human has any idea whats going on at the aub atomic level.  No one has ever evem seen an electrom but we "use" them all the time.

       I think cosmology is so very guilty of poisoning our senses, and its not only through the usually guilty pop sci cake and/or simplified journalism  Although Neil Tyson is beyond useless for anyone past 15 years old, most professional cosmologists and theoretical physicists take the Big Bang very seriously.  And theres tremendous issues if ones an undoctrinated critical thinker, who fears not being isolated from the tribe.

       How are you defining "science" ? Science is only a self correcting method of investigation.
Observe, measure, test, predict this is all of science
. What flaws are in this methodology?
Theres no authority in science, no pope..the hero is the one who can falsify long standing ideas. You minimize  the value of Predictive and Explanatory powers, when thats the very definition of validity in EVERY field of investigation( technology works doesnt it)
You build a strawman of "we dont really understand it so its all falsified (and pointless).....like a heart doctor isnt a real doctor because hes ignorant of all the details of  stemcell fetal heart development (even though he is a sucsessful doctor, as evidenced by his predictive powers, using  "usless science" to predict your future heart complications.)

       If youre looking for a way to include supernaturalism in naturalism. Or if you are rejecting science (naturalism) because its not including super-natural things.....this is the crux maybe of the problem?  It helps to define Naturalism and "Super"(latin for above natural law.) In a nut shell , starting in the Renaissance   its was realized that the universe had Laws that operated in predictable ways = mechanical motions. 
This contradicted Aristotelian  christian cosmologies , because God moves the heavens and that wierd comet was a prophecy of doom.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now that comet is no longer a curse or prophecy of doom...Its PREDICTABLE and explainable. Now we know what comets are made of , its mass, its FUTURE motions ...no demons behind the comet controling when it will appear.....
      </p>
      <p>
       Science isnt  antisupernatural....it  just doesnt need supernaturalism to explain phenomena of comets.
Because every single test and mesurment is showing a mechanical universe...this  naturaly contradicts supernaturalism...
But is also the very thing responsible for the industrial age and modernity....it all comes from a understanding that the motions of the universe follow law...
Natural Theology and deism are some good historical compromises and lots of debates 1800's you can find in History of Philosophy of Science subjects

       I agree with everything you say but I just the opposite opinion. I think it's the people who believe in flat earth who are the ones that part of a physiological operation.

       I'm starting a new movement. The earth isn't flat or round. Square Earth for life bitches. Not cubed , flat 2 dimensional square. We are all in a big Minecraft sandbox. False 3rd dimensions portrayed in 2. Mind blown. WTF
