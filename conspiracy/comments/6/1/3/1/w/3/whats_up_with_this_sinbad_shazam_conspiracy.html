    <div class="md"><p>I think you cleared it up for me!! Thank you for the memory about the president&#39;s kid and secret service agent. Because I always thought THAT was the genie movie &quot;Shazam&quot;. But it&#39;s not. </p>

<p>Ok so I think why many of us have confusing memories about this movie. &quot;Kazaam&quot; came out in 1996 and it stars Shaq as a Genie to help a troubled youth with gang violence. That same year, &quot;First Kid&quot; came out staring Sinbad as a fun secret service agent to protect the presidents son. </p>

<p>I bet most everyone gets these films confused because both films likely had commercial previews that aired during popular TV time (Saturday Morning Cartoons, After School, etc.). Being young, impressionable kids...we prolly just got Shaq and Sinbad confused in our minds, because well, they are both big, bald, black men. </p>

<p>TLDR: I think mandela effect can largely be explained away by people&#39;s poor memories. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This should be in the mandela effect subreddit.</p>

<p>But to answer your question - No, we are not trying to mess with people&#39;s head. Many of us (I am one of them) clearly remember a movie from the 1990s that Sinbad was in. He was a genie and the movie was titled Shazaam.</p>

<p>And no, we are not remember the Shaq/Kazaam movie.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The &quot;heart&quot; thing I always believed came from being told to put your hand over your heart growing up. The arm doesn&#39;t cover the chest as well if you go where the heart really is, so they move it over. I remember being told where the heart was the same as you do. </p>

<p>It is interesting how being told something seemingly so benign could change how you thought about somethng so fundamental though. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Or when various people fictional or otherwise, have been saved by something in the breast-pocket of their jacket or shirt, it&#39;s always because if whatever it wasn&#39;t there it would have hit their heart...

<p>My brain goes so many places with this lol when I get into it I sound crazy but that was honestly one of the stranger ones for me.</p>
