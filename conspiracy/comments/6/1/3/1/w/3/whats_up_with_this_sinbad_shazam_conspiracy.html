       Its supposed to be an example of the Mandela Effect but I honestly think it's just people misremembering Kazaam with Shaq. Shaq is a genie in the film and the genie trope has an intrinsic correlation with the name Sinbad because it sounds Arabian.

       Where's your heart located in your body?

      <p>
       This one freaked me out more because I knew where and could describe it but for whatever reason (possibly that I'm just not remembering it but that seems unlikely) it looks completely foreign.

       Yes it's mostly bullshit but that other part of it is really strange.

       I have a damn good memory for things I actually care about. I've always had people tell me it's in the left side of my body. Every anatomical picture I remember seeing had it there. Even shit in movies like people getting stabbed or shot.
       <em>
        Even an ER show
       </em>
       . Some guy had a knife "just above his heart" in the left side of his chest.

      <p>
       That and the liver wasn't so goddamn huge.

       The "heart" thing I always believed came from being told to put your hand over your heart growing up. The arm doesn't cover the chest as well if you go where the heart really is, so they move it over. I remember being told where the heart was the same as you do.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is interesting how being told something seemingly so benign could change how you thought about somethng so fundamental though.

       When I think of him as an actor I've always associated him with this movie and only this movie.  I just found out last year that it never happened.  I remember both movies as having entirely different plots.  I could be totally nuts, or maybe our timeline's getting fucked with.

       Anyone who's ever watched I Love Lucy religiously back in the day will know that Ricky Ricardo says "Lucy, you got some splainin' to dooo!" in almost every episode.  It was his catchphrase whenever Lucy fucked up.  Or was it?

       I think you cleared it up for me!! Thank you for the memory about the president's kid and secret service agent. Because I always thought THAT was the genie movie "Shazam". But it's not.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ok so I think why many of us have confusing memories about this movie. "Kazaam" came out in 1996 and it stars Shaq as a Genie to help a troubled youth with gang violence. That same year, "First Kid" came out staring Sinbad as a fun secret service agent to protect the presidents son.
      </p>
      <p>
       I bet most everyone gets these films confused because both films likely had commercial previews that aired during popular TV time (Saturday Morning Cartoons, After School, etc.). Being young, impressionable kids...we prolly just got Shaq and Sinbad confused in our minds, because well, they are both big, bald, black men.
      </p>
      <p>
       TLDR: I think mandela effect can largely be explained away by people's poor memories.

       True, there have been a lot of references through the years and that could absolutely contribute to false memories.  But on the flip side, why would everybody since then intentionally misquote what's arguably the most iconic TV show (other than the Simpsons) in American history?

       Some of these can be attributed to mis-remembering but there are too many that are head scratchers for me to discount it altogether.
Something weird is happening and there are a lot more examples, do some reading on those subs and see if any stick out to you.

       But to answer your question - No, we are not trying to mess with people's head. Many of us (I am one of them) clearly remember a movie from the 1990s that Sinbad was in. He was a genie and the movie was titled Shazaam.
      </p>

       And no, we are not remember the Shaq/Kazaam movie.

       The "heart" thing I always believed came from being told to put your hand over your heart growing up. The arm doesn't cover the chest as well if you go where the heart really is, so they move it over. I remember being told where the heart was the same as you do.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is interesting how being told something seemingly so benign could change how you thought about somethng so fundamental though.
