       You can see and even feel the division now days. It's the worst I have ever seen it. And of course it appears to be coming from both sides.... The regulars here and the history buffs should already know they play both sides of every conflict. It is divide and conquer. Always has been..
      </p>
      <p>
       You don't have to pick a side. You should not look at the next person and try to assign them to a side either. Aristotle's quote holds the truth.... Yes their are forces trying to polarize us all.. They hope for attention, even bad attention, to rope you in by emotions to create a scene that may gain them a greater audience. .
      </p>
      <p>
       Some seem to forget that this is not really an activists sub. If you have chose a side and became to emotionally involved then maybe it's time for a break and to reconnect with nature. Notice how events have been just non stop every other day? If it is not one thing it is another. It gets you wound up. And keeps you wound up. Makes you more emotionally involved in the great stage, just where they want you.
      </p>
      <p>
       The way to stay sane while searching for the truth in these turmoiled confusing times is to follow Aristotle's wisdom. I see what's been going on in the sub and felt we all needed reminded of this.

       OK - I meant communist. And communism cannot being accomplished without central
       <em>
        authority
       </em>
       ... and its primary tool to its end is pointing guns.
      </p>
      <p>
       ...What in the world do you mean "we?"
      </p>
      <p>
       Personal property is a sacred, and I mean
       <em>
        sacred
       </em>
       , concept. But this entire scheme, if you break our presence on Earth down to primal dynamics, lends itself
       <em>
        only
       </em>
       to decisions and the consequences of our decisions and this includes personal property.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you claim land, you'd better be prepared to fight for it and defend it.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you claim
       <em>
        anything
       </em>
       as yours, whether you earned it through noble efforts or not, you'd better be prepared to protect it.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, it is the mark of
       <em>
        civilization
       </em>
       to recognize that what an individual gains through his own efforts belongs to him, and it is immoral to lay claim to what others have gained through their own efforts. See - leftists don't want to admit this... that entire idea of "wealth redistribution" is so goddamn loony that if you simply bring the concept to their living room, they say, "No! That's
       <em>
        my
       </em>
       TV."
      </p>
      <p>
       Any kind of coerced welfare is evil at its core. Period. If policy were instituted where the government revokes its recognition of personal property based on the notion that "ownership perpetuates evil against others"
       <em>
        directly
       </em>
       infringes on my right to live as a sovereign individual because the policy doesn't acknowledge
       <em>
        my
       </em>
       existence, which is noble, moral and honest. The entire concept breaks down at the onset.

       You are right, but he had a lot of really great things to say. Btw, for you and anyone else listening right now.  Jan Irvin of gnostic media did a really good mind map on this very subject (McKenna) constellated around a financial elite figure R Gordon Wasson and his ties between CIA and MI6 with the 'golden thread' being the MKULTRA and associated artichoke, mockingbird, cointelpro programs
