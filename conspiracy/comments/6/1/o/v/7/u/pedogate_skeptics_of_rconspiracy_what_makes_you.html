    <div class="md"><p>Maybe John Podesta is some secret pedo, who knows. But that email can only sound sinister if you want it to be.</p>

<p>It&#39;s literally just some families getting together. Secondly, it&#39;s not even to Podesta. He&#39;s just CC&#39;d, and it sounds like he&#39;s not even attending the get together. And did you seriously think that email was referring to an actual Uber? It&#39;s just old people being cheesy as hell, calling this Bonnie lady an &quot;Uber service&quot; since she&#39;s driving their kids over.</p>

<p>To me, the only email that is actually strange to me is the pizza related handkerchief email. But even then, that&#39;s not enough for more to accuse anyone of being a pedophile.</p>

<p>So, a coworker of the campaign, has to bring her kids with her, via Uber, to a working outdoor lunch party, and the kids have a heated pool to play in = Podesta fucks unsupervised children in a hot tub? </p>

<p>This is what makes the Pizzagate circus ridiculous. I&#39;m not denying there&#39;s a pedophilia ring in DC, Hollywood, internationally. I do not think the Wikileaks emails from Podesta show evidence of being involved. We&#39;re still on the cusp of what Vault 7 and the Podesta emails means, as far as US politics. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Skeptic here: After the DNC leaks I was constantly looking at the shit coming out, and while the actual politics shit (mainly against Bernie) was the most interesting for me, it was impossible to ignore the PG stuff coming out. In fact, I wanted to believe at first.</p>

<p>I&#39;m largely skeptical because I haven&#39;t seen anything concise presented. Whenever I asked for a video that connects the dots, it always seems like a rabbit hole that demands a lot of assumptions and very poorly presented.</p>

<p>What I&#39;ll submit, there was some sketchy shit going on, the DNC is wrapped up in a lot of BS and they definitely were speaking in code, however, I&#39;m not convinced it suggests a huge pedo ring for globalists. </p>

<p>Also, I think a lot of the conspiracy folks also take giant leaps that is off putting for me. Going from Podesta is a pedo without evidence to podesta is a part of a huge ring connected at the highest levels of government, entertainment, etc...is too big of a leap to me before believing he&#39;s a pedo in the first place.</p>

<p>If someone thinks there are new sources that help prove the PG theories in concise ways, I&#39;ll watch them, but I&#39;m unconvinced. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>if youve been paying attention at all to this sub at least, you would know the pedo stuff is hugely actual and very covered up.  </p>

<p>so when we get a trove like this, we are definitely looking for any confirmation.  it&#39;s not like these people are not already suspicious, consider podesta&#39;s art collection, just that.  </p>

<p>and in the emails we find obvious code language using well known codes for pedophilia.  Then look at the symbols, then the bands that played there ie Heavy Breathing, and wow, that stuff is all creepy and suspicous as fuck too.    </p>

<p>what i haven&#39;t heard is anyone from your viewpoint have any assertion whatsoever for what they may have actually been talking about with a pizza related map.  were they hunting a pizza treasure?  were they opening up a pizza factory?  I don&#39;t know, what do you think it was?  </p>

<p>So it&#39;s not just 1 suspicious thing in these emails or at the pizza shop, it&#39;s like hundreds of suspicious things.   </p>

<p>Then there would have to be signs of others in government agencies, and people caught trafficking, and guess what?</p>

<p>Laura Silsby, Alefantis&#39;s friend in the human trafficking department, Hilary&#39;s interest in Laura Silsby.  </p>

<p>Now we&#39;re up to a metric ton of circumstantial evidence and you are still going ho hum?   </p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying we have proof to make a case, I&#39;m saying we have more than enough, 10 times over, to warrant further investigation and be very suspicious of these people.   </p>

<p>But what do we get?  A bunch of non-responses, like yours but usually less sincere, that fail to address a single one of the circumstatial points.  ie &#39;that isn&#39; a real pedo symbol&#39; or &#39;they must have been talking about this other map&#39; or &#39;heavy breathing rocks! i love them, that ski mask is so stylin!&#39;  or &#39;there isn&#39;t really any evidence of high ranking officials engaging in depraved sex with children&#39;  </p>

<p>but i never hear those arguments, just a bunch of thought terminating cliches.   (and on the other side, bluster and smoke screens from the likes of infowars)</p>

<p>Also, if it wasn&#39;t a big deal, then Ben Swann would have been just fine and people would have laughed it off, but guess what, huge shitstorm, taken down, and again no discussion of the actual points.  </p>

<p>Anyone looking for the actual debate for this issue won&#39;t find it, there are only 2 viewpoints, investigate further and censorship and guess which side you are on buddy?</p>

<p>Waco was a similar  cult</p>

<p>False memory foundation</p>

<p>Esalen</p>

<p>Bagwan</p>

<p>Cult awareness network</p>

<p>All the above were CIA plus MI6 creations, as part of mind control projects part of mkultra and mockingbird and cointelpro; domestic surveillance and auxiliary services done by the masons and ADL (Jewish PR firm)</p>

<p>These activities were done to control society through fear</p>

<p>So yes, these things did happen, satanic panic is real and was a mind control military program run by Michael Aquino</p>

If so, did you allow your mind to remain open to the possibility of it&#39;s truth or were you quick to reject it simply because the claims seemed so outrageous that you believed there&#39;s no way they could be true? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What even is pedogate? It seems that pizzagate was transformed into &quot;pedogate&quot; because pizzagate was such an obvious sham that they decided to connect it to every instance of child abuse thats ever happened, then pretend it&#39;s all connected somehow and all serves as supporting evidence for pizzagate.</p>

<p>Pedogate and pizzagate make a mockery of real child abuse victims in the name of trying to score the cheapest of points against a political enemy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Same reasons as everyone else. No victims, no evidence. I like the conspiracy sub but it is really obnoxious getting flooded with all the pizzagate stuff that all seems like obvious bullshit in my opinion. None of those emails look very suspicious to me at all and yet people are making this huge jump to crazy satanic pedophile stuff without even trying to look into the actual context surrounding the emails. The blatantly partisan political agenda of the whole thing is pretty off-putting as well and I&#39;m not even a Democrat. The Dyncorp email is the only one that is actually about some real child abuse. A bunch of douchebag, assult-rifle toting mercenaries bullying and humiliating a fifteen year old kid who is probably dirt poor and doesn&#39;t understand english or what is going on. And I&#39;m willing to bet that every one of those assholes votes Republican. &#39;Professional mercenary&#39; and &#39;liberal democrat&#39; don&#39;t usually go hand in hand.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The total lack of any real proof or victims. </p>

<p>All of the things people call evidence rely on already believing the theory to be true. </p>

<p>If you objectively look at any of the facts from a neutral standpoint then the entire theory starts to unravel. </p>

<p>Plus, it seems to come-and-go depending on other news. Like this sub, whenever there is a big scandal or controversy surrounding Trump this place gets whacked until pizzagate dominates the entire front page. </p>

<p>That and nearly everyone who is pushing the theory resorts to calling you a pedophile and/or pedophilia sympathizer if you disagree with them. I&#39;ve lost count of how many times I&#39;ve been called a pedo for simply telling someone I don&#39;t believe them. </p>

<p>And lastly, the timing of it all. The whole theory originated during a close election and the entire thing only focuses and attacks one political party. </p>

<p>Anywho, the point of this post was to ask people why they didn&#39;t support the &quot;popular&quot; view and has since been edited. </p>

<p>And really, if the evidence of pedophilia is being held by Wikileaks, we should see a reveal very soon, with Vault 7 being the warning for what surveillance capabilites were possible. And also, all of the Pizzagate circus is circumstantial, at best. (Which I&#39;m not even saying it is, its a cultural scene not known to most Americans. I&#39;ve been around some of these folks. A lot of cocaine and swinging. Arrogant and crude. Avant-garde humor, wasn&#39;t my scene...)</p>

<p>There would need to be graphic evidence to convict. </p>
