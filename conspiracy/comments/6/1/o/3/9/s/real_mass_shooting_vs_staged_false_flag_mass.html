        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">219</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2017-03-26 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/KaraKellyAz.html">KaraKellyAz</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>ETA: Updated version - Note: Some of you are pointing out the issue of false flag not applying in the way I presented it so to avoid rewrite, consider the way it&#39;s all handled. The MSM and its handlers would still deal with the fake events - whether false flag, hoaxes, manufactured terror attacks, &quot;drills gone wrong&quot; (and seriously, all these drills tend to go wrong and are utterly useless if the shit happens right in the middle of a drill...so why do they keep getting funded? ;-p ) - much the same way. I acknowledge the distinction. All good ;)</p>

<p> </p>

<p>TL~DR: Don&#39;t be lazy, read it all. Laziness is part of the problem...</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Word broke earlier about another mass shooting, this time in Cincinnati, Ohio at the Cameo nightclub. Formerly a gay club, Cameo has had its share of shootings well before this one, where reports range from one lone shooter to multiple shooters who got in some sort of altercation and opened fire. As of this writing the count is 1 dead, 15 or 16 injured. </p>

<p> </p>

<p>As it happens, this mass shooting is a legitimate event and I decided to share a bullet list of the telltale signs that will help you distinguish between legitimate shootings and false flag, staged mass shootings in the future. Staged events all have the same signature &quot;tells&quot; in common. The mass shooting in Ohio has none of these things. </p>

<p> </p>

<p>That’s how we know this mass shooting was very much real.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><strong>LIMITED MAINSTREAM MEDIA COVERAGE</strong></p>

<p>We know that the mass shooting at the Cameo club was quite real because MSM is only giving it a cursory mention before moving on to more pressing news. Had it been a staged event, MSM would be obsessively covering it 24-7, Breaking News, and given priority. We see none of that with the Ohio shooting. Only local media is covering it, while MSM mentions it as an aside, talks to a reporter on the scene who conveys they don’t know anything, and they wrap it up.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><strong>MAINSTREAM MEDIA DOESN’T HAVE A CLUE</strong></p>

<p>We know the Cameo club shooting is real because MSM doesn’t have a clue what happened. That means the coverage MSM offers is not packaged propaganda with a message. None of the more popular names in MSM have converged on the scene to get those interviews from “random” people on the street or eye witnesses who conveniently happen to mention anti gun sentiments.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><strong>SUSPECT/S REMAIN UNIDENTIFIED, MOTIVE UNKNOWN</strong></p>

<p>In a staged hoax mass shooting, within 12-24 hours MSM is always “told” by their “sources” all about the identities of the suspects. MSM reports their names, where they live, their back stories, they’ve managed to have their own investigative reporters uncovering long lost relatives who haven’t actually seen the suspects in years but have juicy stories to tell. The MSM isn’t reporting any of that, and in fact, the first red flag is that MSM announced early on that the Ohio shooting doesn’t appear to be terrorism (because, MSM seems to think foreign terrorism always happens with lone nerdy gun lovers who hate the government, and instead of killing members of government, go shoot up a school of 1st graders or a night club of gay guys). Had this been a staged shooting, MSM, being the propaganda machine that it is, would already be reporting entire life histories of the suspects, whose identities were discovered quite accidentally (and illogically), while the suspects remain at large.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><strong>SUSPECT ACTUALLY CAPTURED BY REAL POLICE WORK</strong></p>

<p>In any shooting incident there&#39;s always a risk of another shoot out between cops and suspect/s, but in most all staged mass shootings, the suspect (usually a loner) will conveniently commit suicide after, of course, leaving a full manifesto detailing the whys and what fors all neatly packaged for MSM to pawn off on people asking why. In real life, LEO will bust out the SWAT team and take the suspect down and keep him or her alive for a trial. If things go south, it&#39;ll usually be the suspect barricading up somewhere and all the LEO will be on the outside, so if a suicide happens it&#39;s pretty clear cut who pulled the trigger. No manifestos surface. Since this mass shooting is real and the suspect/s were still at large, either they will be captured without fanfare, surrender, or barricade a stand off - at which point MSM will probably tune in because some black guy might get shot up on live tv. The staged shoot out never happens on tv...while it&#39;s in progress. The MSM always tunes in a few minutes after something went down.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><strong>LOCAL MEDIA GETS IT RIGHT/MSM PLAYS CATCH UP</strong></p>

<p>The accurate reporting is being done by local Cincinnati media who are at the scene and have the first hand accounts as much as LEO is giving them. MSM has no idea what&#39;s going on there. If this had been a staged false flag fake mass shooting, MSM would - I kid you not - literally tune out the local reporters and begin changing up the narrative until a nice, packaged up tale is formed. They seem to be nearly omnipotent in their depth of inside knowledge about the event, right down to the suspect&#39;s inner thoughts, desires and motives. We never hear from local media again, as eventually, they fall into line and begin reporting the &quot;official story&quot; even when it was markedly different in the beginning.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><strong>THE PRESIDENT ISN’T MAKING A STATEMENT</strong></p>

<p>Trump hasn’t been summoned to provide a statement to the families of those who were shot, or the one killed, offering support and prayers and all those vows to do stuff to help end such gun violence, reviewing policies, making real changes in our gun legislation, etc. Trump and the rest of the government don’t seem to even notice this event took place, they have no comment on it, and aren’t pushing any sort of agenda, as always happens in the staged, fake mass shooting hoaxes perpetrated upon the people.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><strong>MAINSTREAM MEDIA ISN’T REPORTING THE MIND OF THE SHOOTERS</strong></p>

<p>In all the staged mass shootings, MSM carries on for hours, if not days, discussing in great detail the psychology of the shooter/s in their staged events, as propaganda toward demonizing mental illness and other issues that motivate someone to shoot up a group of people. MSM can be seen reporting how the shooter/s spent hours isolated in their darkened room, were loners with no friends, spent hours on the computer looking up ways to kill people, terrorism, and other such unstable behaviors, seeming to know exactly what the shooters were doing while the shooters were all alone with nobody around. We do not see this sort of story telling when it comes to the shootings in Ohio. MSM doesn’t know who shot who, they don’t even have a single name of the dead victim, and they haven’t provided a clear explanation for why the shooter/s shot anyone to begin with.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><strong>NO TERRORIST BASED, ANTI GOVERNMENT PROPAGANDA</strong></p>

<p>MSM has yet to report that they’ve (all) been told by their “inside sources” that investigators discovered all sorts of disturbing anti government, hate based, terrorism material in the shooter’s residence. No stockpiles of assault weapons, no “I hate Amerika” stickers, none of that. If these things were being reported in the first 24 hours, you could be sure it’s a false flag staged fake shooting. Local LEO seems to be the only agency investigating and they’ve not found any of those things because the mass shooting in Ohio is real.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><strong>NO MSM INTERVIEWS WITH THE FAMILY OR FRIENDS ON THE SCENE</strong></p>

<p>Mainstream News Media has sent the bare minimum of its reporters to Ohio (if they actually went anywhere and weren’t reporting in front of a green screen) to cover the story. None of the more familiar faces like Anderson Cooper or Jean Casarez or Don Lemon are in Ohio with their microphones at the ready to interview people on the street to get the scoop, or having tracked down patrons of the club to get the tales of terror. If they mention it at all, it’s in passing before moving on. Had it been a staged event, MSM would be all over it. Anderson Cooper would be doing interviews all month long. We know the mass shooting in Ohio really happened because MSM couldn’t give a shit less.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><strong>NO MSM PRESENTATION PIECE INTERVIEWS WITH THE FAMILY OR FRIENDS</strong></p>

<p>We know the Cameo club shooting is real because MSM hasn’t run a professional presentation piece with any of the parents, spouses, friends or other family members in the studio giving them a week’s worth of exploitative coverage to find out how they were impacted by all this serious gun violence. Had it been staged, MSM would’ve been at the scene within hours of the event happening and the presentation pieces and the family members would be in the studio all nice and presentable for their interviews the next day.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><strong>NO FAKE PARENTS LAUGHING, MAKING FACES, AND PRETENDING TO CRY</strong></p>

<p>In all the false flag, staged mass shootings, MSM has the parents and loved ones in the studio for their controlled interviews within 24 hours of the “massacre” event, and the parents or loved ones will always be dressed to the nines as if they’re attending a dinner party, they’ll be laughing as they fondly recall all the silly shenanigans their dead family member used to do, they’ll wince their faces and sniffle but there are no bloodshot eyes, no red noses, no flowing tears. No agony. Ohio is a real mass shooting because nobody’s even seen a family member on tv for any reason.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><strong>NO AGENDA BASED CROWDFUNDING PAGES, NO DONATIONS, NO ACTIVISM</strong></p>

<p>The mass shooting in Ohio is very real and we know this because people involved are too busy grieving, being angry, or on the run from LEO to worry about posting on social media, taking selfies with Anderson Cooper, or setting up fundraising websites to garner cold hard cash from the community to help the victims’ families. When it’s a false flag, staged mass shooting event, within 24 hours just about everyone involved in the hoax will have one or more funding pages set up, they’ll be hawking for donations, setting up non profits in the names of the dead, and will likely be awarded hundreds of thousands of dollars each from the government itself.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><strong>LOVED ONES AREN’T MAKING THE ROUNDS PUSHING FOR STRICTER GUN LEGISLATION</strong></p>

<p>Within the first 12 hours of a staged, false flag, fake mass shooting, MSM and the fake family members of the victims (and living victims) will rally together making the rounds calling for tighter gun control laws, they’re giving one interview after another and mentioning their bafflement at why anyone would ever need an assault weapon. More needs to be done. Within the first 24 hours of the Cameo club mass shooting, there have been no interviews, no calls for weapons regulations, and none of the victims have even been identified, let alone interviewed.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><strong>NO 24-7 ANTI GUN PROPAGANDA DEBATE</strong></p>

<p>Mainstream News Media can barely mention the Ohio mass shooting before moving on to other topics. All staged, false flag fake mass shootings are reinforced by near constant debate on every network, every channel, arguing over what needs to happen to prevent these mass shootings…which they aren’t bothering with at all over the mass shooting at the Cameo club.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><strong>SHOOTER/S ACTUALLY MISS</strong></p>

<p>The shooter or shooters involved in the mass shooting at the Ohio Cameo club opened fire on the club goers, killing just one person while 15 or 16 people were injured – though it’s unclear if they were all shot or if they suffered injuries trying to run for cover. Had it been a staged event, MSM would tell you the gunman, armed with an arsenal of assault weapons, enjoyed a 100% kill rate – if they shot 26 people, 26 people died. If they shot 47 people, all of them died. Most all fake shooters have a crackshot accuracy, while real shooters actually miss.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><strong>NO DRILLS!</strong></p>

<p>In every single false flag staged mass shooting (or other mass casualty) event, the Department of Homeland Security, along with FEMA and a few other government funded agencies happen to show up in the same town to assist local LEO train for a very specific event that in 90% of the cases, actually miraculously takes place right in the middle of the drill. In the rest of the cases, the very thing they trained for during their drills takes place within a week or two shortly thereafter. There were no drills taking place in Cincinnati or regarding training local LEO to better handle a mass shooting at this particular club. That’s even more curious, considering local media coverage has reported this particular club has been the scene of shootings a number of times in the recent past. Clearly, these drills don’t work, yet…</p>

<p> </p>

<p><strong>NO PROFESSIONAL PRESENTATION PIECES PUSHING PROPAGANDA</strong></p>

<p>In every staged false flag fake mass shooting, MSM’s graphics departments (every single network, every single channel) manage to all produce emotional tear jerker pieces to promote the agenda of tighter gun legislation, as well as indoctrination toward an anti gun sentiment. Each of these pieces are remarkably similar and are nearly verbatim, though they’re allegedly competitive networks. There will be a total of zero propaganda pieces produced on any network related to the mass shootings at the Cameo club. Ever.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><strong>NO VICTIMOLOGY TO EXPLOIT</strong></p>

<p>The mass shootings at the Cameo club were quite real and is going mostly unreported by MSM because everyone involved is likely a minority and Mainstream News Media doesn’t give one rat’s ass if blacks kill each other off, they’d be happy to get rid of the whole useless lot of them. Who cares? Certainly not MSM – not even enough to exploit it to push the anti gun agenda. None of the parents of Sandy Hook, who’ve gone to enormous lengths to push their anti gun agenda and indoctrination programs will step foot anywhere near the Cameo club to push for tighter gun laws or bans (because in real life they’d probably get shot). There aren’t any poor little children to exploit. No teenagers. No “heroes” who got people to safety. The fact MSM isn’t touching this story is a glaring indication it’s a real event.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><strong>PHYSICAL EVIDENCE EXISTS TO PROVE IT HAPPENED</strong></p>

<p>In real homicides of any nature, there is always physical evidence that links the suspect to the scene to the crime and to the victim. There may be long delays in the right technology resolving it but it&#39;s always there. In real crimes, there are usually eye witnesses or ear witnesses, there are fingerprints and DNA, even photos or video. Technology and social sharing is a thing these days so it&#39;s unlikely that a big event will not have some amateur documentation attached. In the fake mass shootings, the physical evidence doesn&#39;t exist so it is manufactured and offered up quickly or vaguely. Blood spatter doesn&#39;t jive with the narrative, there will be conflicting reports between LEO, FBI, MSM, coroners, medical examiners, doctors, and witnesses. All of the accounts cannot be true yet these conflicts are ignored and treated as an irrelevant aside by the agencies involved, reinforced by MSM propaganda. In other cases, the evidence clearly points one direction while the narrative insists it&#39;s untrue and if challenged, the campaign to scapegoat, target, mock and destroy commences.  None of these things took place in Ohio. There are and will be later available, crime scene photos, the reporting agencies will match, witness statements will match, blood evidence will match and all of it points in a particular direction that all the agencies agree on.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><strong>COLD STORY, MOVING ON</strong></p>

<p>Chances are 100% that this story dies a rapid death and it will be days, weeks, maybe even months before local LEO figures out the whole story, who was involved, what happened, what it was about – same as any other shooting case in their city. MSM might – though it’s unlikely – add an aside to the end of a news cycle to report some vague reference to the shooting but by and large, since it’s not manufactured terror, they have no role as propaganda outlets to report on it as a legitimate event. That’s not what they do.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><strong>BACK TO BUSINESS</strong></p>

<p>When it’s all said and done, the club will reopen, perhaps change hands or management, insurance will handle the clean up and makeover and it’ll reopen, business as usual. The city of Cincinnati, and the state of Ohio, will not hold secret, closed door hearings to decide amongst their select groups, to lock down documentation that is public record in every other state, they will not block crime scene photos or video, or withhold or censor death reports and information so nobody finds it on the internet. It’s a real crime, a real crime scene, with real victims…and it will be soon forgotten. In the staged fake mass shooting event, the venue will be torn down, removed, carted off, erased. </p>

<p> </p>

<p><strong>INDIFFERENT TO HOAX ACCUSATIONS</strong></p>

<p>Because MSM and their handlers are too stupid to recognize the bigger issue of credibility, they will mock, ridicule, demonize and target anyone who challenges the official narrative as “conspiracy theorists” (as if it’s a bad thing to be one of those), refuse to allow a platform for it, and step up the propaganda. The shills and trolls will swarm various comment sections and forums to try to argue and distract from the issues at hand, or deny it, and then act like imbeciles thinking they’re actually the smart one in the room. This is always a threat mode behavior. </p>

<p>In the case of a real shooting, such as Ohio, of those who’ve lost every shred of trust in anything the media pawns off and assumes all mass shootings are hoaxes, just to be safe, MSM and their handlers will conveniently ignore these sorts entirely. No shills will frequent the forums. No trolls. It’s real, there’s no need to push a narrative or a program so they’ll effectively ignore anyone who suggests a real event was a hoax. Savor the irony there.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><strong>NOT A SINGLE FAKE DOCUMENT, PHOTO OR VIDEO / NO COVER UP</strong></p>

<p>No one involved in the Cameo mass shooting will be caught presenting photos or video, or official documentation that’s been doctored in any manner. No warped extra fingers on the hand of a friend next to a victim. No unrealistic fake blood spatter. No redacted nonsense from official public records. All the real names will be available, nothing will be covered up. All information will be made available as it’s usually done, by law. </p>

<p>Unlike a staged false flag fake mass shooting where those involved in defrauding the public will fight tooth and nail to restrict all access to documentation that’s public everywhere else, redact information, fake evidence, suddenly remove evidence, conduct a half assed investigation, produce official narrative reports with evidence that defies the laws of physics, photo shopped images, faked videos, and an enormous campaign to scrub, doctor or conceal everything that would simply prove the event actually happened as reported. When there’s a mass concealment and crackdown, even to the extreme of making inquiries illegal – it’s nothing but manufactured terror.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Remember, if MSM has full details, presentation pieces, interviews lined up, and push an agenda 24-7, it’s propaganda and the event is a staged, false flag manufactured event. Question everything and don’t just choke it down. ALL manufactured events have these things in common. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Using the terms fake, staged, and false flag interchangeably is a little misleading because false flag used to mean that people died but the perpetrator was planted. Now so many people think false flag means entirely fake (1984 newspeak anyone?).</p>

<p>The Pulse nightclub shooting was real, but it might have been done by someone other than Omar Mateen, like a clandestine group of assassins that is trained for these types of events.</p>

<p>Also Pulse night club wasn&#39;t torn down but is becoming a memorial, and the hit rate wasn&#39;t 100% as it was about 50 dead 50 injured.</p>

<p>I wouldn&#39;t be so sure that this isn&#39;t a false flag attack yet. They could be changing their tactics for the Trump era especially as more people are becoming conspiracy theorists.</p>

<p>Fun fact - he almost did his mass shooting at Disney about a week or two before according to his wife. He had his guns and all with him but decided at the last moment to not do it. Then some days later he shot up the club. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The local media was reporting, and I only saw it once on Fox (you tube video, I don&#39;t watch that shit) where this club has been the scene of shootings before, more than once. It&#39;s a pretty violent place. The media hypocrisy makes me sick sometimes - this is just as much gun violence from a lone or multiple shooters with some serious issues if they think it can be settled or a statement made by shooting a bunch of people at a night club. So where&#39;s the agenda there? The fact they&#39;re doing none of these things they do during the propaganda campaign is proof this was never about ending gun violence, it&#39;s pushing anti gun paradigm, indoctrination of children to think guns are bad, and ultimately about ending gun ownership. </p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>There&#39;s 100x more gun violence in the inner cities, projects, ghettos, lower income neighborhoods with 7 and 8 year old (black) children bringing guns to school, shooting people - and these MSM anti gun sorts are dead silent. Why aren&#39;t they rallying in Queens or LA or Detroit talking about their &quot;let&#39;s all raise everyone&#39;s children together&quot; and &quot;guns are bad!&quot; bullshit? </p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>That&#39;s one more resounding indicator of proof it&#39;s never been about ending gun violence - the fact they aren&#39;t where gun violence is the  most common. </p>
