        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>So here&#39;s what happened on his show. You tell me what you think.</p>

<p>Jones says that Comet Ping Pong is innocent and it was a honeypot distraction. He provides no basis for this besides &quot;we knew about this in December because our sources told us its to distract from the Weiner investigation&quot;. To be clear he doesn&#39;t not even attempt to debunk anything about PG and he does not prove CPPs innocence whatsoever. &quot;Trust me guys&quot;</p>

<p>He then says he&#39;s going to drop the biggest revelations about PG to date. His &quot;revelations&quot; were just rehashing what anyone in the know is already discussing on a regular basis and that&#39;s the by supporting terrorists and toppling governments Hillary Clinton inadvertently murders kids and puts kids in to the sex trade. He also references that there&#39;s &quot;no basement at Comet ping pong&quot;. He kind of uses the mass arrests across the country as part of his &quot;revelations&quot; as well. He doesn&#39;t offer anything that hasn&#39;t been reported already. </p>

<p>That&#39;s it.</p>

<p>What&#39;s so fucking weird is that he still references every other aspect of PG. Ambramovic and spirit cooking, the Podesta emails, Laura silsby etc., not discussing the connections between Comet Ping Pong and the Podesta&#39;s. It&#39;s extremely weird. Doesn&#39;t discuss any of the irregularities with the &quot;shooting&quot;, among many other oddities. Go watch it back for yourself.</p>

<p>The gist of this is that Jones tells us Comet Ping Pong is innocent without debunking or disproving any claims against them. Jones doesn&#39;t provide any new information at all on Pedogate pizzagate or anything for that matter. He&#39;ll most likely squeak by on this running the narrative that &quot;I&#39;m brining exposure to Clinton&#39;s war crimes and human trafficking!&quot; Which is great Alex but don&#39;t fuck around here you&#39;ve provided nothing and only raised more suspicion by failing to disprove any claims. </p>

<p>This is #1 bullshit </p>

<p>Edit: no basis*</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If CPP was a honeypot, it wasn&#39;t a very effective one. The only people who cared about CPP were on forums like this one or 4chan. The wider public wasn&#39;t aware of many of the pizzagate theories, and therefore couldn&#39;t have been distracted from Weiner, which was much more on the public&#39;s mind. Alex Jones has been completely compromised as any source of truth, as evidenced by this stupid publicity stunt </p>
