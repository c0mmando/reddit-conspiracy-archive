       So here's what happened on his show. You tell me what you think.
      </p>
      <p>
       Jones says that Comet Ping Pong is innocent and it was a honeypot distraction. He provides no basis for this besides "we knew about this in December because our sources told us its to distract from the Weiner investigation". To be clear he doesn't not even attempt to debunk anything about PG and he does not prove CPPs innocence whatsoever. "Trust me guys"
      </p>
      <p>
       He then says he's going to drop the biggest revelations about PG to date. His "revelations" were just rehashing what anyone in the know is already discussing on a regular basis and that's the by supporting terrorists and toppling governments Hillary Clinton inadvertently murders kids and puts kids in to the sex trade. He also references that there's "no basement at Comet ping pong". He kind of uses the mass arrests across the country as part of his "revelations" as well. He doesn't offer anything that hasn't been reported already.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's it.
      </p>
      <p>
       What's so fucking weird is that he still references every other aspect of PG. Ambramovic and spirit cooking, the Podesta emails, Laura silsby etc., not discussing the connections between Comet Ping Pong and the Podesta's. It's extremely weird. Doesn't discuss any of the irregularities with the "shooting", among many other oddities. Go watch it back for yourself.
      </p>
      <p>
       The gist of this is that Jones tells us Comet Ping Pong is innocent without debunking or disproving any claims against them. Jones doesn't provide any new information at all on Pedogate pizzagate or anything for that matter. He'll most likely squeak by on this running the narrative that "I'm brining exposure to Clinton's war crimes and human trafficking!" Which is great Alex but don't fuck around here you've provided nothing and only raised more suspicion by failing to disprove any claims.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is #1 bullshit
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: no basis*

       The only outstanding points on these latest statements are: the pizza place is not involved, the Podesta are innocent.
      </p>
      <p>
       Which may mean just that them are the only ones seeming to have threatened to sue him.
      </p>
      <p>
       The reiteration of past denouncements on already outed scandals may be just the way for Jones to save face for his hardcore fan base.

       Didnt the actor gunman that went into comet pizza get convicted the same day or right before he made his retraction? That actor gunman case probably strengthened the lawsuit threats. Which could have been the whole purpose of actor in the first place.

       I personally think the mess with the pizza places still has many odd angles that merit investigation. But when the legal apparatus hammers you down, it's not easy to, shall we use a timely term,
       <em>
        resist

       Or it could have been to draw our attention and put too much focus in the wrong place. I'm not saying to drop investigations into CPP or blindly trust Jones. However, we should be open to the idea that it was a distraction, based on the use of an actor in the shooting.

       Classic Alex.  This guy is an entertainer and he's pretty good at it but that's it.  So good he'll even sell you some snake oil after his performance.

       The whole Alex Jones shit is annoying..

       What I think JA may actually be, instead of a pedo himself, is one of their murderers..

      <p>
       I kind of get this sense from him with the whole kill room and that, but also I remember him saying to that YouTuber he supposedly threatened, that what is being portrayed about him and what he really does are different..
      </p>

       Maybe Alex got a friendly reminder of this?

       I have to say - and I apologize if this makes me seem naive - but this "bombshell reveal" really changed my opinion of Alex Jones for the worse.
      </p>
      <p>
       I never held him up as a paragon of the truth movement or anything like that, but I at least thought his heart was in the right place.

       Now I'm not so sure.

       If CPP was a honeypot, it wasn't a very effective one. The only people who cared about CPP were on forums like this one or 4chan. The wider public wasn't aware of many of the pizzagate theories, and therefore couldn't have been distracted from Weiner, which was much more on the public's mind. Alex Jones has been completely compromised as any source of truth, as evidenced by this stupid publicity stunt
