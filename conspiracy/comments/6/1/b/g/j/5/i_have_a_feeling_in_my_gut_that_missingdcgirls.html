        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>It&#39;s really profound to see such a hashtag trending on Twitter. There is so much emotion invested in this movement. I really do have an instinctual feeling that this is it. I think people are going to put the two and two together; #MissingDCGirls and Pizzagate. </p>

<p>As each day passes, this movement is only going to grow. We have the info we need, missing children in D.C., and a global human trafficking ring operating out of D.C. (allegedly). Whether &quot;Pizzagate&quot; as we know it is true, this movement is going to CREATE a new, more structured &quot;Pizzagate&quot;, with support of &quot;normies&quot;</p>

<p>People are going to turn on D.C. officials. Whether they like it or not, people are going to start accusing D.C. as being the main hub for human trafficking. I believe it&#39;s inevitable, especially if the girls aren&#39;t found. </p>

<p>I have not seen a hashtag like this before. We are living in some interesting times. I can only hope my intuition is right. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No. A missing person is not evidence of a crime.</p>

<p>Blood. Witnesses. CCTV. These are examples of evidence.</p>

<p><em>Corpus delicti</em>, or &quot;body of the crime&quot; refers to the legal concept &quot;that a crime must be proved to have occurred before a person can be convicted of committing that crime.&quot;</p>

<p>Its wikipedia page references murder, but it can apply to pretty much any crime:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Corpus delicti</em> is one of the most important concepts in a murder investigation. <strong>When a person disappears and cannot be contacted, many police agencies initiate a missing person case. If, during the course of the investigation, detectives believe that he/she has been murdered, then a &quot;body&quot; of evidentiary items, including physical, demonstrative and testimonial evidence, must be obtained to establish that the missing individual has indeed been murdered before a suspect can be charged with homicide.</strong>[2] The best and easiest evidence establishment in these cases is the physical body of the deceased. However, in the event that a physical body is not present or has not yet been discovered, it is possible to prove a crime took place if sufficient circumstantial evidence is presented to prove the matter beyond a reasonable doubt.[3] For example, the presence at a missing person&#39;s home of spilled human blood, identifiable as that person&#39;s, in sufficient quantity to indicate exsanguination, demonstrates—even in the absence of a corpse—that the possibility that no crime has occurred, and the missing person is merely missing, is not reasonably credible.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Note the process of a proper investigation:</p>

<p>Incident &gt; Evidence of crime &gt; search/investigation into suspects</p>

<p>Pizzagate is the opposite. PG proponents have suspects, and are actively looking for evidence of a crime.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Uhhhh lived in the south my whole life and the black organ harvesting you reference not accepted as fact in the south. Im not Denying it&#39;s existence and it may be something that&#39;s discussed in smaller groups than the south as a whole but it&#39;s definitely not something people here consider as known facts. Also the guy who was stuffed with a newspaper isn&#39;t suspected to have had his organs stolen for trafficking. They were stolen to hide the cause of death so people wouldn&#39;t know that he was really beat to death rather than suffocating from getting stuck in mats that were rolled up which is what the police said happened. Two kids were listed as potential suspects but their dad works for the FBI so.... charges were never pursued and im pretty sure one is playing college football now. If you want to make generalized claims like that, you should at least do a little research on them. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>1) I didn&#39;t mean for it to sound as though the entire south is aware of / discussing it, though that&#39;s how I wrote it. I meant there&#39;s groups of people I know personally and have seen online/in print that have generally accept organ harvesting as a common practice, especially in more rural areas. 
2) You can steal and sell someone&#39;s organs without killing them for it. They never said what was done with his organs (from everything I&#39;ve read), and those things are valuable.  I believe he was killed by his fellow classmate or whatever but I also believe his organs weren&#39;t just thrown in the trash.</p>
