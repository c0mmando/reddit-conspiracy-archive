       It is important to recall the exact wording of Trump's tweets about wiretapping.
      </p>
      <p>
       Something that has escaped notice is Trump's use of the term 'sick' to describe Obama.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Bad (or sick) guy!"
      </p>
      <p>
       What Trump is saying here, given the parentheses, is that it's a possibility that Obama is a sick guy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now criminal spying is bad, but what exactly could explain the possibility that the person responsible for it is also a sick individual?
      </p>
      <p>
       Expect to hear some troubling news regarding which names were unmasked as well as the content of what was incidentally collected.
      </p>
      <p>
       Based on my analysis I would assign a greater than .8 probability to the notion that Trump's children and grandchildren were spied upon.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes, they may have even watched Ivanka and her children.
      </p>
      <p>
       For those who have been keeping up with unconstitutional surveillance since the PATRIOT Act, the possibility is already part of your background knowledge. Agencies at multiple levels, even local law enforcement, using surveillance equipment to monitor women and kids for purposes which, shall we say, have nothing to do with the official justification for the surveillance.
      </p>
      <p>
       It has happened in the past.
      </p>
      <p>
       Given the Vault 7 manner in which they bugged Trump's circle, I have high confidence that they picked up audio and possibly video of his kids.
      </p>
      <p>
       If they spied on Barron Trump and Ivanka's baby and toddlers,  it is natural for Trump and everyone to see this as deeply disturbing. It is natural to raise concerns about them being very bad people... or very sick people.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump's tweet again:  Bad
       <strong>
        (or sick)
       </strong>
       guy! Is it legal for a sitting President to be ‘wire tapping’ a race for president prior to an election? Turned down by court earlier.
       <strong>
        A NEW LOW!”
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Note as well his use of single quotation marks: 'wire tapping'.  What this likely indicates is that he knows it's not wiretapping in the strict sense of that term but it's more akin to V7-style spying.

       It's been proven that Obama didn't wiretap Trump.  Comey, a Republican (and no fan of the Democrats) said in no mixed terms that Presidents can't do that and if it were to happen, it would be made public that the President broke the law.

       The president can't but the intelligence community can. If that IC is under Obama, round up, factor the common demonstrator and you end of with Obama's Administration Wiretapped Trump.

       Nunes said he went to the WH to tell Trump because he was disturbed by what he read. What could he have seen in the documents that made him feel he had to immediately tell Trump, putting his career at risk, and basically sacrificing himself to the rabid media and (at this point) unhinged dems?

       The information Nunes received may have compromised Nunes along with the some of Trump's people. Remember Nunes was part of the Trump Transition team.

       My guess is FBI baited him with a small about of info to see how he would react and he fell into the trap like a mouse to cheese.

       Let me get this straight:  Im supposed to care that Trump or his family have been spied on?  An elite family that has trampled over the little man their entire lives.

       Pretty much. And if anyone was actually in a position to do something about it, you'd think it would be the President. Bill Burr had a bit about Michelle Obama calling on the American People to help find those 93 African Woman that were kidnapped and he said, "What am I going to do? I'm a comedian. What... Am I going to hit the kidnappers with a mic stand? You see that guy sitting across the table from you at dinner?"

       Instead of sending out a Tweet, pass an Executive Order repealing the Patriot Act and the Freedom Act and all the rest of the anti-constitutional legislation. Audit the Fed. Audit the Pentagon. Break up the CIA. And then hide out in your shelter with your family and armed guards you can trust while the Government implodes.
