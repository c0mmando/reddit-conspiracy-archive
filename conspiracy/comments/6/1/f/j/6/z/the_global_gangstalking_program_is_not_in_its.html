    <div class="md"><p>It is metaphysically impossible for the new world order to succeed at this point. No amount of violence can ever make a lie become true. They can get away with maintaining their empire of lies in the short term but in the long term a lie will require ever increasing levels of violence to keep it going. The fundamental trap is there is no amount of violence that can keep the lie going forever. The harder they clamp down the more they expose themselves which leads to more people waking up. The cycle then repeats where they have to clamp down even harder than before to suppress the truth which wakes up still more people. We have been going through cycles like this for quite some time and we are nearing the end point. </p>

<p>What we are going through now is the dark night of the soul when pretty much everyone wakes up the lies that been enforced with violence around them. The end won&#39;t be pretty but will be a mega disaster for the new world order.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re forgetting something. Every cycle that repeats, the machine learns something new.</p>

<p>This time, to be one with the machine means life and security. To resist and detach, will mean death for all, as the earth itself is poisoned ahead of the war, to ensure that nobody can survive without the feeding tube of the government.</p>

<p>If you are here to preach the idea that we will always have hope, I understand what you are saying. That has been true up until now. At this point, though, my assessment is that their victory will be final.</p>

<p>Never before have they had the ability to massively indoctrinate and upgrade the entire human population. Nobody will be left behind in the next culling. It will be a culling to end all cullings, as new planets await terraforming. Whoever &quot;they&quot; is, they don&#39;t need this planet or humans anymore.</p>

<p>They have AI and robots now, after all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Divinity is becoming master of one&#39;s own reality. Understand that death is an illusion possibly one of the greatest of the all the deceptions of the dark powers. Maybe you are not ready for that deep of a truth. There are many who have found true enlightenment at the bottom of the rabbit hole. Man is a divine being that can never be destroyed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The dark side exerts power through the physical world by controlling currency, immigration, media, etc. The light side exerts power through the spiritual world by waking up the consciousness of the planet. Large populations of people are beginning to see the world for what it is, despite concentrated information warfare to prevent it.</p>

<p>Now, the attention will be focused on controlling the awakening. You&#39;re seeing more and more &quot;woke&quot; celebrities, who are talking about some of the same ideas that we talk about. This is deception, plain and simple. But the point is that they&#39;re being weakened and put on the defensive.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t prescribe to these variations of dark and light. The yin and yang can be described like a mountain. When the sun rises one side of the mountain is light, and the other side still dark. Then a mix of both until it is equally lit on both sides.</p>

<p>All of life has this harmony. </p>

<p>If I had to go all Star Wars then at least I would say, that the dark side manipulates and controls. The light side merely suggests. Beyond these simple precepts, each actor makes his or her own choices, which manifest in many forms.</p>

<p>At this moment the dark side has taken more than their fair share, and that is to balance some other factor brought by nature&#39;s will. Many do not understand the situation they are in, arguing for morality in a box. Instead we have a sphere and nothing is ideal, but there are really two ways to go. You can stand opposed to all others who are alive, or you can adopt methods to coexist.</p>

<p>Well now it is twisted. Everything humans are, is twisted to be the opposite of its intent. </p>

<p>Freedom is Slavery, and all that...</p>

<p>I&#39;d almost say it&#39;s becoming politically impossible. Whatever you feel about Trump, the only reason he got in was he appeared to be the only candidate that felt like he was &quot;outside the establishment&quot; enough that people wouldn&#39;t riot.</p>

<p>They literally could not have allowed someone like Jeb Bush or Hillary Clinton to have won without insurrection.</p>
