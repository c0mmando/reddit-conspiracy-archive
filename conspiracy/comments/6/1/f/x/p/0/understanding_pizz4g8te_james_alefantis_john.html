    <div class="md"><p>No, this is a bunch of good-hearted people who saw evidence of child abuse being talked about and boasted about online and in leaked emails.  The evidence prompted those good-hearted people to investigate the issue further.  This is evidence archived by citizen investigators that has since been deleted and removed by the conspirators/perpetrators.  The fact that the evidence is legally hearsay is irrelevant to a citizen investigation.  The evidence complied should be enough to open a criminal investigation however.  Such a criminal investigation would have subpoena power over the email provider and the social networks sites and could quickly determine the legitimacy of some of the evidence at hand. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah I&#39;ve often wondered since this all began - are people reacting strongly like they often do to consp. theories in gen. because the overwhelming horror of what they indicate - the smoke leading to/indicating a fire (the very actual long burning fires of Hades in PGs case), evidence/discovery of actual fires in some confirmed conspiracies but still - is it simply because people don&#39;t want to entertain, speculate about or discuss Pizza/Pedo G as it is fundamentally too much for them to emotionally, spiritually and psychologically consider or do they want to be taken seriously on the grounds of applying logic, reason, evidence etc....as many citizen investigators and Russian hackers, er sorry, internet sleuths are clearly doing and uncovering enormous quantities of puzzle pieces that are beginning to form a coherent picture when put together with large collections of puzzle pieces from previous eras or incidents such as:</p>

<ul>
<li>What &quot;Kendall&quot; revealed on Dr. Phil the a couple of days ago confirming what many have known for ever</li>
<li>The Dutroux scandal</li>
<li>Franklin Boys Town scandal</li>
<li>The Presidio military preschool scandal and other related incidents</li>
<li>The combined history of the catholic church in gen. but specifically their enormous historical involvement in perping and suppressing the evidence of their perping pedo activities on orphaned children in their care</li>
<li>The number of cases world wide but esp. the UK, USA, Canada and historically prominent/important European countries where social services, govt. dept&#39;s/agencies/intell./spook, law enforcement have involvement in outright perping and enabling pedo activities for political blackmail and utilisation in ritual abuse scenarios </li>
<li>The mind blowing series Jan Irving of Gnostic Media has been doing with Steve Outtrim on the dark, occult history of Silicon Valley, the 60s counter culture and Burning Man fest.</li>
<li>Dave McGowan: &quot;Programmed to Kill&quot;, &quot;Weird Scenes inside the Canyon&quot;</li>
<li>Maury Terry: &quot;Ultimate Evil&quot;</li>
<li>Jay Dyer: &quot;Esoteric Hollywood: Sex, Cults &amp; Symbols in Film&quot;</li>
<li>Peter Levenda: &quot;Unholy Alliance&quot;, &quot;Sinister Forces&quot; Trilogy:</li>
</ul>

<p>Sinister Forces - The Nine: A Grimoire of American Political Witchcraft </p>

<p>Sinister Forces - A Warm Gun: A Grimoire of American Political Witchcraft</p>

<p>Sinister Forces - The Manson Secret: A Grimoire of American Political Witchcraft </p>

<ul>
<li>Daniel Ryder: &quot;Cover-Up of the Century&quot;</li>
<li>Linda Blood: &quot;The New Satanists&quot;</li>
<li>The overwhelming amount of recorded historical evidence indicating the common practice of these types of rituals by similarly positioned social classes then to who it is suspected is perping it today such as but not limited to Marquis de Sade, Vlad III, Gilles de Rais and amongst the lineage of European Black Nobility who knows how many more. I suspect endless amounts all engaged in similar &quot;pastimes&quot; as the above.</li>
</ul>

<p>When all these pieces of the puzzle are put together the picture is admittedly overwhelming but it is undeniable, incontrovertible and hard to formulate any other poss. explanation other than Satanic Elite parasites who feed off of the combined emotional, spiritual, financial and physical often negative or lower resonance/frequency energy output of the masses of humanity.</p>

<p>It is people who have developed a coherent understanding and ability to recognise the patterns of reoccurrence and familiarity of ritual, circumstance, synchronicity and evidence that are able to look at the modern day evidence contained in PG and draw likely conclusions. </p>

<p>Not y&#39;all who are frankly casual observer/normie citizen criticisers who are out of your depth or agent provocateurs, shills, algorithm programmed bots or corporate narrative control freak/political/ideologically compromised intell./spook operatives - y&#39;all neither have the gumption, perspective or moral fibre to comment and often in many cases I believe intentionally obfuscate and distract due to your complicity.   </p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure if you&#39;ve noticed but the entire newswire is lit up over allegations and suspected behavior.</p>

<p>Since when did &quot;allegations and suspected behavior&quot; equal guilt and/or proof of guilt? Whatever happened to &quot;Innocent until proven guilty&quot;? Or does that only apply to those that you approve of?</p>

<p>Yes they did - albeit not literally. This whole narrative is you people&#39;s way of pronouncing guilt. You are just a bad as the Main Stream Media. Pack wolves attacking with no proof.</p>

<p>It is not Illegal to be &quot;strange&quot;. Unwise, perhaps, but not <em>Illegal</em>. If you obtain proof that the law was, in fact, broken then charge them in court. Otherwise this is just elaborate gossip...just like old women.</p>

<p>If something isn&#39;t proof then by definition it is <em>opinion</em>. There is <em>no in-between</em>. There is only two things: fact and not fact. The &quot;not fact&quot; is opinion. So your claim that it is not fact but yet not opinion is false. Try to use some elementary logic here. Your whole narrative is for your own self promotion. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can see lots of reasons why this post might cause awareness. For one, I imagine many people are scanning this sub right now because of the event in England. Also, the strange nature of the AJ retraction. Not to mention all the weird activity at the Whitehouse this week. And the PG protests. I mean, I hung out here for months while being interested in other subjects, completely refusing to open a PG thread because it sounded so preposterous. Then, I finally did, and set out to debunk.

<p>Interesting. I actually came here a lot <em>because</em> of PG. I set out to investigate it, as we can all agree these are serious allegations. Then when I realized every single piece of &quot;evidence&quot; was easily debunked, I tried to point it out to people, but you refuse. Mainly, because PG proponents would rather repeat the same things to each other in an effort to reaffirm what they already believe than actually look at the &quot;evidence&quot; objectively.</p>

<p>Said as they forgo an actual discussion to participate in an echo chamber. </p>

<p><a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is nothing but an echo chamber. It&#39;s a circlejerk of people reinforcing each other&#39;s beliefs. More than that, we are propaganda. We are disinformation. It doesn&#39;t matter what is posted on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> that is true, no-one outside of the people who already believe it will believe it because for all the posts about <em>real</em> conspiracies, there are flat Earthers, people who believe in lizard people, or something else ridiculous that discredits the truth. For every 10 people you reach outside of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, 99% of the time 9 out of 10 ignores it. Because most <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> users are locked into this echo chamber that reinforces groupthink, they&#39;re totally oblivious to the fact most people outside of this community don&#39;t care, nor will they ever care. People are stupid, complacent, easily distracted and diverted. The average person does not give a shit about <em>anything</em> we talk about on this subreddit. </p>

<p>And that&#39;s the crux of this issue. It&#39;s all in the imaginations of PG proponents.</p>

<p>Tell me, if I wanted to collect modern art and I wanted to build a room to display a complicated video art piece (maybe like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d3YZV-qYig&amp;amp;spfreload=10">this one</a>), would I be suspected of being a pedophile, too?</p>

<p>This is beyond reaching. You&#39;re accusing someone of one of the worst crimes imaginable based on nothing. It&#39;s sick.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you had all of the other weird pedo-adjacent connections to your life, then yea 100%. But if you were just an average normal person who collects art, then no not at all. And even if you were still accused, you&#39;d be easily able to disprove any of the theories by telling people exactly which parts of their theories are misconceptions. Unlike what Podesta did which was just call everyone crazy and provide zero evidence to the contrary.</p>

<p>Connecting the dots involves some imagination, doesn&#39;t mean you&#39;re inherently wrong just because you don&#39;t have proof of fact. Stay skeptical of the claims, sure. But don&#39;t dismiss everyone because of a few people that make huge claims based on pretty big leaps of assumptions.</p>

<p>Only if you&#39;re the brother of another well known pedophile, refer to your vault as a torture chamber, and collect &quot;art&quot; that prominently features children being abused.  That&#39;s beautiful, btw.</p>

<p>That&#39;s a picture of his friend and his god-daughter. Have you tried searching for &quot;chickenlovers&quot; on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/chickenlovers/">instagram</a>? There are plenty of pictures that don&#39;t include chickens, yet (strangely enough) don&#39;t reference pedophila either.</p>

<p>Even if we go by the definition given in the picture (that it means a gay man who loves younger boys), the picture is of a married man and his daughter. So is his daughter also a gay man that loves younger boys? Or is it referecing the married man gay boy-loving his daughter? It makes no sense. Or they like chicken... Hmm...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, it&#39;s just equating &#39;spirit cooking&#39; with satanism/cannibalism shows a fundemental misunderstanding of an art form and a clear lack of sophistication. Let me ask you this, do you think Metallica&#39;s &#39;Load&#39; and &#39;Reload&#39; are. concept albums about satanism and child abuse? Because going by their &#39;spirit cooking&#39; album covers this subs belief that all things spirit cooking is evil, you would have to.</p>

<p>fundemental misunderstanding of an art form</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So now a subjective belief on what is and isn&#39;t art is an objective truth to be learned through higher education? Call it art if you want, it is still repulsive and offensive and meant to be destroyed by other people. Furthermore, people who appreciate this art will be harassed and ridiculed by people who are offended by it. Many people believe Marquis de Sade should be celebrated as a great liberal artist. Others will always believe he is the antithesis of sickening depravity.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Indeed I was just offering another point of view. I personally believe he got sued by James Alefantis and doesn&#39;t want to mess with the legal trouble of actually being sued for slander. But in the spirit of tinfoil he could of also been threatened. Alefantis has shown that he will threaten folks already. If you remember the case of the guy who made the pegasus museum video. He eventually got a federal investigation into the threats made from alefantis from his verified facebook. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Right.. evidence of him threatening someone over that very topic somehow discredits him? This all happened after he identified where the killroom was in a video. Whether you believe his evidence or not is up for debate sure. But saying that online threats and text messages that he verified then went to file a police report on is hardly discrediting the notion of alefantis threatening someone.</p>

<p>It is much easier to argue that the evidence is faked than to say evidence shows that he is innocent.. Are you saying all of a sudden his outrage and threats at this one guy show organic feelings of disgust by being accused of a pedophile? Where was this anger when it first started. </p>

<p>Edit: So I would say evidence of threatening one person would lead me to at least entertain the Idea it happened in this situation. The threat could of been very different such as a huge financial legal battle he wouldn&#39;t want to be a part of just because of expense. But it looks like AJ is controlled opposition more and more each day.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So he destroys the root of his credibility which is the source of his financial success to avoid a lawsuit that threatens his finances? No. The guy just met the actual force he&#39;s believed he had been empowered to topple. And it showed him who is boss. This isn&#39;t about a lawsuit. it&#39;s about the power they have using law AND ruthlessness to not only destroy him but torture him in ways he never believed possible. I mean psychologically, physically through his family, friends. We are talking about him alone attempting to stand up against a system that farms infants to be raped, tortured and murdered. What is Alex Jones going to do against that? Shoot it? Barricade himself in the studio and defeat world militaries? Sorry guys the people who control Alex at this point will press a button and vaporize millions in nuclear fire as a simple reminder of who&#39;s in control when and if  needed. Alex is a weak link in the offense against that and now it can&#39;t be denied.</p>

So if your pizza place facilitates satanic ritualistic child abuse for luciferian elites that would be a pretty big revelation to the common american.  probably would cause an uprising and CIA isn&#39;t too keen on empowering the people.</p>

This is just yet another disinformation operation against Jones and the &quot;skeptics&quot; in here will leave it alone because it&#39;s probably they who are posting the garbage theories about Jones under other accounts. In case you didn&#39;t know, Alex Jones is also a Jew and anti-semitic, depending on which disinformation persona you are talking to. Jones might be a shady businessman, a CIA agent, or Bill Hicks. The list keeps going, there&#39;s no proof of any of it, and the &quot;skeptics&quot; won&#39;t call these theories out for how many holes are in them.

    <div class="md"><p>I mostly stopped arguing against the validity of pizzagate because I don&#39;t think anyone is gonna change their opinion on the subject in either direction.</p>

<p>Regardless, if you personally see PG as a concerted effort by supporters of Donald Trump (the most powerful man in the world) to demonize his political opposition with spurious child rape accusations, well then, it seems like something worth pushing back against.</p>

<p>Again, I don&#39;t feel like actually arguing about PG itself, but I find it super annoying how PG proponents always try to shut down critics like this while totally overlooking the actual reason people have to be critical. It&#39;s always &quot;If you accept my construction that PG is totally apolitical and well-intentioned and ignore the fact that these accusations always seem to be pointed at Trump critics, what possible reason could you have to argue against me!?&quot;</p>

<p>Also, the whole Helen Lovejoy &quot;won&#39;t somebody think of the children!&quot; act is super irritating when you suspect the people saying it are just using kids as a political cudgel. </p>

I do absolutely believe the few victims that have been able to come forward describing an extremely sick, powerful human trafficking/pedophile torture murder ring.

<li><p>Antinous has been a <a href="http://www.positivelite.com/component/zoo/item/the-antinous-cult-the-story-of-the-first-gay-superstar">gay icon</a> for years. I mean, even if you don&#39;t know the history, the statue is clearly of a young <strong>man</strong> and not of a child.</p></li>
<li><p>That&#39;s a picture of his friend and his god-daughter. Have you tried searching for &quot;chickenlovers&quot; on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/chickenlovers/">instagram</a>? There are plenty of pictures that don&#39;t include chickens, yet (strangely enough) don&#39;t reference pedophila either.</p>

<p>Even if we go by the definition given in the picture (that it means a gay man who loves younger boys), the picture is of a married man and his daughter. So is his daughter also a gay man that loves younger boys? Or is it referecing the married man gay boy-loving his daughter? It makes no sense. <strong>Or</strong> they like chicken... Hmm...</p></li>
<li><p>Since when is GQ a reliable source of who&#39;s really powerful? Since when have college dropouts been barred from success? Since when does becoming &quot;powerful&quot; mean you are a pedophile?</p></li>
<li><p>What? Art can&#39;t take place in a private residence? The man displays art in his private residence all the time. It&#39;s one of the things he&#39;s known for. It&#39;s referenced in this thread multiple times. What evidence do you have that it wasn&#39;t part of some art?</p>

<p>And who cares what &quot;spirit cooking&quot; looks like. As long as they&#39;re not breaking any laws, we live in a country where we have the freedom of speech. I&#39;ve seen more disturbing &quot;art&quot; come from comedy music groups.</p></li>

<li>Antinous is the icon of pederasty, immoral sexual indulgence, and idolatry. Hadrian took him as his servant when he was 12 years old and began to rape him. Read more books.</li>

<li><p>Now that I have educated you on Antinous and the underlying meaning behind the deification of Antinous, you can clearly see the intent of chicken lover hash tag. Mental gymnastics will not increase your ability to think.</p></li>
<li><p>I would say that GQ is a solid source on a lot of things. Drop outs are not barred from success but being 49th most powerful person in a town where 100 Senators live is a bit beyond successful for a guy who runs a pizza shop. How much money do you think a person can net in one year running a pizza shop in Washington DC? </p></li>
<li><p>Partaking in a &#39;spirit cooking&#39; in a private residence is beyond suspect. I don&#39;t care what it looks like, and don&#39;t particularly care when this is done in the context of an exhibition. Lady GaGa licks fake blood off a real person submerged in a vat of more fake blood. People take pictures and think they are cool and edgy. Everyone wins. Taking this shit inside someone&#39;s house? If this doesn&#39;t sound a little past bizarre, I can&#39;t help you. Some people don&#39;t want leaders who think pretending to eat people is art. Who knew?</p></li>

<li><p>Antinous has never been considered an icon of pederasty (except by PG sickos). It&#39;s why you only link to the wiki screenshot and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antinous">article</a> itself. It doesn&#39;t mention <em>anything</em> about pederasty. Furthermore, even your own link shows that he was between the ages of 12 <strong>and</strong> 18. The only people emphasizing pedophilia are PG proponents. Nobody else claims that. It&#39;s sick that all you can think about is pedophilia everywhere you turn.</p></li>
<li><p>Again, you don&#39;t provide evidence for shit. You&#39;re telling me that I have to take your made-up claim about Antinous and apply it to an instagram picture of the guy&#39;s friend and god-daughter to turn it into some kind of weird reference to his straight friend gay-boy-loving his daughter. And <em>I&#39;m</em> the one practicing gymnastics?</p></li>
<li><p>For the sake of argument, let&#39;s assume he did shady shit to become so &quot;powerful&quot;. How does this relate to pedophilia, cannibalism, or satanism?</p></li>
<li><p>It wasn&#39;t just any private residence. It was the private residence of the artists herself. She was inviting them to come to a spirit cooking in <em>her</em> house. How the fuck is that strange? Furthermore, these aren&#39;t our elected officials. I don&#39;t give a shit what kind of art they&#39;re into. I don&#39;t give a shit if they listen to <em>Die Anwoord</em> or listen to <em>GWAR</em> or watch <em>South Park</em>. We live in a country that values freedom of speech.</p></li>

<p>Oh, and you can keep the numbering by putting a space before your link. It will then become part of #1, and the next point will be #2.</p>

<li>The person who wrote the foremost work on the lives of Hadrian and Antinous had this to say about the sculpture. </li>
</ol>

<p>Lambert believed that the sculptures of Antinous &quot;remain without doubt one of the most elevated and ideal monuments to pederastic love of the whole ancient world&quot; It&#39;s literally in the Wikipedia entry. Read more. Talk less. He is an icon for <em>boy</em> lovers aka pedo rapers.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>It&#39;s not evidence. It&#39;s a fact. The hash tag speaks for itself. This is a man who, like Hadrian and countless other &#39;leaders&#39; before him throughout the eons of history, preferred to fuck kids. They are sick, evil cowards. </p></li>
<li><p>For the sake of argument, you could quit avoiding the many questions I have put to you. Shady shit + Antinous + chickenlover = ?? Why do you want it to be false so bad? It&#39;s true. </p></li>

</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t know what books reference this, but maybe because words can be used differently depending on context?</p>

<p>Again, if we go by the definition given (that it&#39;s a gay man that loves young boys), then <em>who</em> was the hashtag referring to? It&#39;s clearly plural. One of the subjects is a married man and the other is his daughter. How does the definition provided by PG proponents make more sense than if we interpret the hashtag like we do on all the other instagram pictures that use the hashtag? As an innocent comment on loving chicken? I&#39;ve even seen chicken lover&#39;s pizza, similar to &quot;meat lovers&quot; pizza (or can that only be a sexual reference, too?).</p>

<p>No that&#39;s not my response. I am asking you to test your reason by explaining how a system/ring as described by the victim in Dr Phil could exist alongside other rings of this size and power.

<p>Some people actually care about people. I understand that&#39;s hard to understand from someone who likely sits and jerks off to illegal porn all day. Children are actual people that are born of absolute innocence and goodness. When you hook yourself up to the dehumanization regime of Youporn etc. you end up like yourself. Completely disconnected from reality with a permanently damaged capacity for empathy. Stay in your safe place and make value judgements. Knowing that if you ever met a person like me and talk the way you do you won&#39;t be given a chance to change your mind. Keep being tough. Your complicity is SHINING through bright and clear.</p>

<p>I&#39;m asking what evidence you have to say that James Alefantis, John Podesta, and Tony Podesta are raping children?</p>

<p>We aren&#39;t in court here boss. So.. unless you have some evidence proving they aren&#39;t then we might have found ourselves in a stalemate. Sorry if you don&#39;t want to hear that. But in the court of public opinion they are sick weirdo pedophiles who like to hang out with the same.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>or are you attempting to fabricate a connection</p>

<p>I&#39;m not attempting anything.</p>

<p>So...  are you asserting there is ANOTHER pedo ring as powerful and organized as the one the victim describes on the Dr Phil episode? </p>

<p>And I&#39;m not a judge; I didn&#39;t ask if you had sufficient evidence beyond a reasonable doubt.  I asked if you had evidence that you weren&#39;t making false rape accusations.</p>

<p>No.  I&#39;m not commenting on that at all, and it should have been clear from my comment.  Do you need me to make things simpler for you to understand?</p>

<p>I&#39;m not making false rape accusations. And if you think i am go and cry to someone that gives a shit. I&#39;m telling you Podestas are infant raping

<p>yes you are. You are saying the Dr Phil episode is not linked to pizza/pedogate. I am telling you it is. So produce your proof or even present me with your reasoning with regards to how they possibly can&#39;t be related.</p>

<p>For what it&#39;s worth:</p>

<p>Yeah I&#39;ve often wondered since this all began - are people reacting strongly like they often do to consp. theories in gen. because the overwhelming horror of what they indicate - the smoke leading to/indicating a fire (the very actual long burning fires of Hades in PGs case), evidence/discovery of actual fires in some confirmed conspiracies but still - is it simply because people don&#39;t want to entertain, speculate about or discuss Pizza/Pedo G as it is fundamentally too much for them to emotionally, spiritually and psychologically consider or do they want to be taken seriously on the grounds of applying logic, reason, evidence etc....as many citizen investigators and Russian hackers, er sorry, internet sleuths are clearly doing and uncovering enormous quantities of puzzle pieces that are beginning to form a coherent picture when put together with large collections of puzzle pieces from previous eras or incidents such as:
What &quot;Kendall&quot; revealed on Dr. Phil the a couple of days ago confirming what many have known for ever
The Dutroux scandal
Franklin Boys Town scandal
The Presidio military preschool scandal and other related incidents
The combined history of the catholic church in gen. but specifically their enormous historical involvement in perping and suppressing the evidence of their perping pedo activities on orphaned children in their care
The number of cases world wide but esp. the UK, USA, Canada and historically prominent/important European countries where social services, govt. dept&#39;s/agencies/intell./spook, law enforcement have involvement in outright perping and enabling pedo activities for political blackmail and utilisation in ritual abuse scenarios
The mind blowing series Jan Irving of Gnostic Media has been doing with Steve Outtrim on the dark, occult history of Silicon Valley, the 60s counter culture and Burning Man fest.
Dave McGowan: &quot;Programmed to Kill&quot;, &quot;Weird Scenes inside the Canyon&quot;
Maury Terry: &quot;Ultimate Evil&quot;
Jay Dyer: &quot;Esoteric Hollywood: Sex, Cults &amp; Symbols in Film&quot;
Peter Levenda: &quot;Unholy Alliance&quot;, &quot;Sinister Forces&quot; Trilogy:
Sinister Forces - The Nine: A Grimoire of American Political Witchcraft
Sinister Forces - A Warm Gun: A Grimoire of American Political Witchcraft
Sinister Forces - The Manson Secret: A Grimoire of American Political Witchcraft
Daniel Ryder: &quot;Cover-Up of the Century&quot;
Linda Blood: &quot;The New Satanists&quot;
The overwhelming amount of recorded historical evidence indicating the common practice of these types of rituals by similarly positioned social classes then to who it is suspected is perping it today such as but not limited to Marquis de Sade, Vlad III, Gilles de Rais and amongst the lineage of European Black Nobility who knows how many more. I suspect endless amounts all engaged in similar &quot;pastimes&quot; as the above.
When all these pieces of the puzzle are put together the picture is admittedly overwhelming but it is undeniable, incontrovertible and hard to formulate any other poss. explanation other than Satanic Elite parasites who feed off of the combined emotional, spiritual, financial and physical often negative or lower resonance/frequency energy output of the masses of humanity.
It is people who have developed a coherent understanding and ability to recognise the patterns of reoccurrence and familiarity of ritual, circumstance, synchronicity and evidence that are able to look at the modern day evidence contained in PG and draw likely conclusions.
Not y&#39;all who are frankly casual observer/normie citizen criticisers who are out of your depth or agent provocateurs, shills, algorithm programmed bots or corporate narrative control freak/political/ideologically compromised intell./spook operatives - y&#39;all neither have the gumption, perspective or moral fibre to comment and often in many cases I believe intentionally obfuscate and distract due to your complicity.</p>

<p>Said as they forgo an actual discussion to participate in an echo chamber. </p>

<p><a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is nothing but an echo chamber. It&#39;s a circlejerk of people reinforcing each other&#39;s beliefs. More than that, we are propaganda. We are disinformation. It doesn&#39;t matter what is posted on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> that is true, no-one outside of the people who already believe it will believe it because for all the posts about <em>real</em> conspiracies, there are flat Earthers, people who believe in lizard people, or something else ridiculous that discredits the truth. For every 10 people you reach outside of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, 99% of the time 9 out of 10 ignores it. Because most <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> users are locked into this echo chamber that reinforces groupthink, they&#39;re totally oblivious to the fact most people outside of this community don&#39;t care, nor will they ever care. People are stupid, complacent, easily distracted and diverted. The average person does not give a shit about <em>anything</em> we talk about on this subreddit. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>To be honest i really haven&#39;t spent the amount of time you personally have with Pizzagate. I do absolutely believe the few victims that have been able to come forward describing an extremely sick, powerful human trafficking/pedophile torture murder ring. It follows reason that people that use violent domination without empathy to control societies would use this as a means of defeating empathy in themselves to foster sociopathic mentality required to be the top dog.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m asking what evidence you have to say that James Alefantis, John Podesta, and Tony Podesta are raping children?</p>

<p>As far as I can see, trying to tie them to this alleged pedo ring is just a false rape accusation.   Do you have evidence that the men in the title of this post have commited acts of rape, or are you attempting to fabricate a connection?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Right.. evidence of him threatening someone over that very topic somehow discredits him? This all happened after he identified where the killroom was in a video. Whether you believe his evidence or not is up for debate sure. But saying that online threats and text messages that he verified then went to file a police report on is hardly discrediting the notion of alefantis threatening someone.</p>

<p>It is much easier to argue that the evidence is faked than to say evidence shows that he is innocent.. Are you saying all of a sudden his outrage and threats at this one guy show organic feelings of disgust by being accused of a pedophile? Where was this anger when it first started. </p>

<p>Edit: So I would say evidence of threatening one person would lead me to at least entertain the Idea it happened in this situation. The threat could of been very different such as a huge financial legal battle he wouldn&#39;t want to be a part of just because of expense. But it looks like AJ is controlled opposition more and more each day.</p>
