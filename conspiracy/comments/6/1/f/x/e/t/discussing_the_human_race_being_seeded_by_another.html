<p>I&#39;m a Forgotten Languages guy (shameless plug to r/ForgottenLanguages, if you have specific questions about what the fuck forgotten languages is, please ask). Not that I believe what they say necessarily, but I follow the site closely, daily, and have been for months now along with a few other people trying to translate the languages and figure out what exactly is going on there. They&#39;ve exposed me to an idea that I find interesting.</p>

<p>They&#39;ve posted a few articles (<a href="http://forgottenlanguages-full.forgottenlanguages.org/2017/03/on-lyapunov-beings-denebian-probes-and.html?">most recent</a>) discussing the &quot;seeding&quot; of the human race by a superior civilization. In effect, they &quot;created&quot; the humans we know today by influencing their evolution, and in effect use us as autonomous terraformers. The following are quotes from that article I linked. It should be noted that these are quotes within the article that are in English and not translated, and most of the information that we&#39;ve been able to find out about the site in general strongly suggests that this is secondhand information (as in they didn&#39;t write this themselves, they&#39;ve told us all they do is translate, which we can support through our method of translation), but we cannot find it anywhere else.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;In order to secure a stable population of Homo sapiens sapiens the designer needs to guarantee a slow evolutionary response since in the presence of fluctuations, stability becomes related to long time delay. Once t is fixed to that value, one can be force the evolutionary (phenotypic) rate nu for hominids to take the required value: n = 1/5.000.000 = 2 x 2-7.</p>

<p>Note that the solar system possesses an intrinsic noise source due to chaos and characterized by t = 5.000.000 years&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Sol-3 observation, terraforming, and seeding is a continuous long-term program, hence it is reasonable to conclude that probes have been visiting the planet at least since the Bangui Event, some 14 Myrs ago. We also know that the propagation of the most ancient SVA type A took place about 13.5 Myrs ago, and the youngest SVA types appeared in the human genome after the chimpanzee divergence, therefore it is obvious that at least 13.5 Myrs ago one - or several - of those probes crashed in or around the Bangui-Gobero transect.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Current research posits that insertions of members of the older SVA subtypes A-C occurred in genes involved in more primitive characteristics whereas younger SVA D-F1 insertions were present in genes linked to more sophisticated human-specific traits. Inserting SVAs in multiple human genes allows for an efficient response to an environmental stimulus. This means you need to control that stimulus targeting SVA regulatory sequences. Potential positive feedbacks in functional interactions of genes with inserted SVAS would have a larger impact on phenotype compared to if only a single gene within a pathway contained an SVA insertion. A controlled stimulus with a period of 2100 to 2500 years - like the Hallstatt cycle - matches our observations&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Humans are clearly more susceptible to psychiatric disorders than Neanderthals; however, humans can terraform the planet autonomously, 
while Neanderthals cannot. Seeding the planet with humans means you can proceed with next planet in your sequence of exploration and seeding without having to carry out the terraforming yourself. The visiting schedule would then be each 11,000 years, 22,000 years, 44,000 years, and 88,000 years. Star cluster NGC 3603, located at some 22 Klyrs from Sol-3, has the highest concentration of stars in this galaxy, thus it is clearly a place to visit, much as NGC-4590 - 44 Klyrs from Sol-3 - and SagDEC - 88 Klyrs.&quot;</p>

<p>Do you consider things like this to be a possibility? Are there other views that are similar to this? What do you believe caused humans to branch of to such drastically differing levels of intelligence compared to other species?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>the first test subject, a suicide soldier from the Islamic State, was administered a high dose of milDMT that made him feel blissfully enfolded, comforted, bathed in love, a regression to and activation of infantile longing by the promise that a benign deity would reward childlike surrender with permanent euphoria. The second test subject, an IS soldier captured near Deir al-Zour, was exposed to PSV Presence. Though the subject lived in the UK before his joining the IS, and thus knew about UFOs, he was unable to associate the exposure to PSV Presence to an extraterrestrial vehicle of some sort. Therefore, induced mystical experiences do not provide veridical insights into reality. Our sense of reality is not based on evidence, but on cultural prejudices.</p>

<p>As boundaries disappear between self and world the result is a sense of unity – with the world, with the cosmos, with nature, with the community, with all humankind, or with God. Unity is ‘the hallmark’ of mystical experience, and it is that sense we need to induced in exposed targets. <strong>Strangely enough, the average subject seems to hold a negative view of the New World Order, yet he is ready to accept his oneness with the entire cosmos. So, unless you wrap the entire NWO strategy with some sense of mystical experience, it won&#39;t work.</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>In my mind, this seems the most likely explanation for the emergence of <em>homo sapiens</em> and language. Sitchin&#39;s 3 things that all human cultures have in common include: 1) the preciousness of gold, 2) the flood myth, and 3) the concept of humans being created in God&#39;s (or the gods&#39;) &quot;likeness and image.&quot; </p>

<p>In addition to this, I believe that <em>language</em> is the Promethean gift bestowed to man. It is key to distinguish language from other forms of communication using Chomsky&#39;s criteria (particularly, that language is the use of <em>arbitrary</em> sounds and symbols to convey <em>specific meaning</em>). When understood in this way, language is obviously something that is limited to humans, and it is the vehicle for cultural complexities such as science, engineering, history, and mathematics, which humans have leveraged for effective dominion over the planet.</p>

<p>The other fact that I think we have to keep returning to that (doesn&#39;t prove, but) points to the seeding theory is the genetic difference between humans and their genetic ancestors, the great apes. Humans have 23 chromosome pairs, while the great apes have 24. I do not know of any example where biology claims that creatures evolved by <em>losing</em> genetic material. </p>

<p>Acolytes of <em>scientism</em> will downvote this to hell, but I am highly skeptical of anyone who claims <em>knowledge</em> about the origins of man and language... Those are true mysteries.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I do believe this is what happened. The main entity responsible is the one known as Yahweh to us. </p>

<p>Since you are proposing aliens seeded our genetic code then I suppose you won&#39;t mind me citing alien sources of information in the following explanation.</p>

<p>I will make a summary of the subject as covered in the <a href="http://www.lawofone.info/">Law of One</a> recordings. These were channelings with a social memory complex called Ra transmitted by the L/L research group in the early 1980s. I have studied the majority of the transmissions, and all of the transmissions related to human history. Ra discusses this at length. For more great research on the subject you can check out <a href="http://wespenre.com/">Wes Penre&#39;s</a> work. </p>

<p>A common sentiment expressed by extraterrestrials in regards to the human &quot;experiment&quot; is that we are a very unique species relative to most in our nearby galactic family. This is because humans originate from a large number of backgrounds, and have had a number of genetic experiments performed on us throughout our evolutionary cycle. For this reason we have a very broad spectrum of emotions and an enmormous creative potential. These things can be both a blessing and a curse. To understand why, first we need a brief excursion into our solar system&#39;s history. </p>

<p>Sentient life first evolved on Venus over 2 billion years ago. This is where Ra&#39;s peoples evolved. While they are a much older species than us, even Ra had contact from more advanced beings that evolved closer to the galactic center that aided them in their spiritual evolution. So it is actually the norm for a budding society in their &quot;3rd density&quot; stage to be contacted and aided by various positive and negatively oriented groups. Since Ra&#39;s group was very positively oriented, they &quot;graduated&quot; the 3rd density cycle onto 4th density positive, along with their planet (planets are conscious, too), and had a rapid evolution up to 6th density in which they now inhabit as a social memory complex. A social memory complex is a being that shares all of the memories of their species, and a strong psychic connection is in place between them. </p>

<p>Because these beings were the first (to my knowledge) to ascend past the 3rd density stage in our solar sytem, they joined the confederation of planets (has a base on the rings of saturn) which contains highly evolved beings that are close to source consciousness which governs the local space so that other beings (usually 4th, 5th density) from other star systems don&#39;t interfere too much with the evolving 3rd density life. You see, 3rd density is the stage in which your society makes a choice: to be of service to self or service to other. Upon making this choice is the graduation to 4th density. The Kali Yuga in vedic philosophy refers to the 3rd density cycle. As we enter into the age of Aquarius, we are beginning the end of the ~75,000 year cycle of third density characterized by agricultural and societal development, ending in technological developments that allow us to join our greater family amongst the stars. Because we are at the end of a great cycle, there is an increase in ET&#39;s contacting us and trying to influence us in the ways that they see fit. This is all regulated by the confederation. but certain universal law makes it so that the polarities of the influencing groups must be balanced. So if they let a positive group like Ra come down and build some pyramids to help our planet and societal energies, then they also have to let negative ET groups come in and tinker with things. </p>

<p>Now that the background is out of the way, lets talk about more recent history. There used to be a planet called Maldek situated between Mars and Jupiter. As far as I know this was the second planet to begin harboring 3rd density life. This was within the last million years, so long after Venus had graduated to 6th density. Life there ended up having a predisposition towards violence, and wars wracked their planet for many years. Things got so bad that about 705,000 years ago they completely destroyed their planet. It is now what we know as the asteroid belt. The beings were traumatized from this event, all of their physical bodies getting destroyed in an instant. So their souls were trapped in a &quot;knot of fear&quot; for a while. Around 500,000 years ago a social memory complex was able to utangle this knot and begin transporting the souls into the body complexes available at the time. They were placed in 2nd density forms with 3rd density consciousness so they could learn from their actions and not destroy everything again. Some of these souls still exist in 2nd density forms on Earth - we call these &quot;bigfoot&quot;. </p>

<p>Mars had also developed 3rd density life several hundred thousand years ago. Perhaps some of the Maldek souls were transported to Mars, that I do not know. However, according to Ra there was a similar event on Mars about 75,000 years ago (possibly nuclear war) which destroyed their atmosphere, making the planet inhospitable to 3rd density life. This is about the time that Earth was beginning its 75,000 year 3rd density cycle, so many of the Martian souls were transported to Earth. Because the martian body is not physically compatible with Earth, the being known as Yahweh was granted the request to use his own DNA to create a template for the Martian souls to inhabit and continue their third density lives on Earth. So about 75,000 years ago you have 3rd density life coming about on Earth, mostly from 3 sources: locally evolved Earth beings, Maldek beings that were ready to incarnate into 3rd density forms again, and Martians that were being transported with this genetic template from Yahweh. </p>

<p>There have been many other influences from other planets in nearby star systems that have had varying degrees of influence on our current genetic makeup. Apparently beings from Venus also came and I believe this is what makes up the &quot;elite bloodline&quot; families which share most of the control over human civilization. Its hard to find more information about that, though. </p>

<p>There was another significant influx of genetic material via Yahweh in more recent history (and this I think is the basis for some of the Biblical stories). Roughly 3,600 years ago there was a great deal of negative controlling influence from the Orion empire. To counter this, Yahweh though to create a more spiritually positive race with superior genetics by incarnating on the planet and mating with the local population. This being was known as “Yod Heh Shin Vau Heh”. The beings produced are known as the Anak. This was a race that was much taller, stronger, and smarter than the average human. This plan ended up backfiring, though, because the negative Orion beings were able to get these beings to think they were superior to the average human, and thus were convinced to establish power over society. </p>

<p>Since you are interested in languages, here is a final tidbit of info from Ra. Apparently Hebrew was transmitted by the genetic code given by Yahweh. Sanskrit, on the other hand, was evolved naturally. Both of these languages are special in that they have contain tones that are resonant with the structure of our universe as dictated by the Logos which formed our galaxy (the galaxy is also a consciousness). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I greatly appreciate this, a lot of this information is relevant to what I&#39;ve been studying recently and has provided me with quite a bit of insight. I find it immensely interesting that many of the studies of Astrology share remarkably similar knowledge.</p>

<p>Ive been hearing about the beginning of the Age of Aquarius quite often recently, id be lying if I said I wasn&#39;t very interested in what&#39;s to come for humanity</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The first link I mentioned is a great start. Over 100 channeling sessions with Ra, there were many topics covered. They have a nice search function, too so you can search for things you are interested in. The second link is Wes Penre&#39;s site which has tons of information on ET channelings and whistleblowers from black projects talking about various entities and histories related to humanity. He has compiled it and sort of picked out the consistencies and written several papers on the evidence he has accumulated. I haven&#39;t read it all but it seems the first three parts of his focus on alot of Sitchin&#39;s works. Later parts focus more on the Ra material and Cassiopaean channelings (<a href="https://cassiopaea.org/">https://cassiopaea.org/</a>). Note I&#39;ve mostly just read the Ra channelings so the information I gave was from that one source (except the speculative part about beings from Venus which was inferred from the Hidden_hand dialogues <a href="http://illuminati-news.com/00363.html">http://illuminati-news.com/00363.html</a>). I have not read Sitchin&#39;s works or the Cassiopean channelings. There is conflicting information in other sources. Some of the sources are probably disinfo and others could be just errors from the beings transmitting, errors in transforming time into our system of measurement, and errors in the transmission (ie the channel was inserting their own biases into the information being spoken).</p>

<p>The links I mentioned should be plenty to start with, I&#39;m sure theres alot of other interesting material I&#39;m unaware of!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They&#39;ve actually proposed an explanation to that.</p>

<p>In our endeavours to understand the Forgotten Languages organization,  they brought up the topic of free will. Now, assuming that we are nothing but autonomous probes, how would we be able to tell if we truly have free will? One obvious answer would be to go against the will of whoever may or may not be controlling us. Assuming we&#39;re terraforming, why would they let us cause changes to the planet in any way that wouldn&#39;t benefit them? </p>

<p>They told us that perhaps the only real way to confirm that we aren&#39;t put here to terraform this planet to the specifications they dictate would be to act to destroy it entirely. Of course this dooms the human race unless we move on to other planets, but it would definitively prove that we at least have some semblance of free will. If we&#39;re put here for a purpose, surely the creators wouldn&#39;t let us diverge from that purpose.</p>

<p>I&#39;m trying to dig up the emails about this specifically, the closest one I have on hand is the one in <a href="https://m.imgur.com/a/irkOt">this</a> album that asks &quot;Why is destroying your planet so important to you?&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your field of study is seems very interesting. I&#39;m wondering if it&#39;s possible that human DNA has been tampered with &amp; if the possibility of chemical spraying could also be part of the problem.</p>

<p>Funny, this is the second post I&#39;ve read that brings this subject up, I&#39;ve just started reading about this.</p>
