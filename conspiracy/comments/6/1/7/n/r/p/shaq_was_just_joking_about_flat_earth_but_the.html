       The sun and moon can be seen with the naked eye. They are spheres so the most likely answer is we are on a sphere. Not enough? Go to a beach with a simple telescope and watch distant ships fall behind the horizon. Wouldn't happen if the earth was flat. Still not enough? Take that telescope and find other planets, they are spheres too. Still not enough? Go find a mountain and go a certain distance from it measuring your elevation with the elevation of the base versus your distance from the mountain and how much of the base you can see, some simple math will show that the earth is curved.

       Just now realized that you didn't get the 2nd test, about building getting farther away the higher they get. The ocean test proves the earth is curved at very least. The building test proves something entirely different... it prove that gravity effects objest at different angles. As in, both building are straight up and down but lean away from one another. Using the degree of lean and distance between building it's easy to calculate the shape of the earth. This is something architects account for when designing large structures like bridges and dams.

       no, for everyone.  the scientific process merges left brain and right brain. you are using as little to no brain as possible to keep up the beliefs you have in your head.
      </p>
      <p>
       the science process levies its BELIEF in thorough investigation of cause and effect. not casual correlation, and not acceptance by refusing some other side. its a negative postulation (hypothesis) and a positive experiment of process to aim to disprove the negative postulation, making an irrefutable positive correlation.

       I challenge your assertion that I was being abusive.  (I was obviously not being threatening.)

       The thesis was that we know nothing outside our direct experience.  This can be demonstrated to be completely untrue by a simple application of logic -- the demonstration of which I placed in my above post.

       Read my comment history homie. I find FE/RE/HE interesting. I don't "hate" it like the rest of the community. But when FE is the first conspiracy you come in contact with, you'll take it as science fiction, regardless if its true or not because I cannot definitively confirm, and associate the rest of the conspiracies with the "science fiction FE."
      </p>
      <p>
       Therefore, when they come across pedogate, 9/11, Sandy Hook, Boston Marathon etc, or any other real conspiracy that can be proven/confirmed, they'll lump it in with FE and they'll dismiss it without looking at things from an unbiased standpoint.

       And it's not racist, it's knowing that these rich famous people are controlled and will say or do anything for their massive paychecks.
      </p>

       If I was a rich athlete I'd say I believed in FE if it meant I'd get to keep my game and fortune. Or wouldn't care how it fooled the masses. The masses are DUMB.

       The earth isn't dish shaped, my work colleagues in India are 12 hours away, there would have to be two suns to make the same effect of rotation with day/night distance. You come up with a working model of the planet, you can't because the current one is right.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also you are a liar, having a telescope would allow you to see the ship fall below the horizon, you are just wrong. The moon casts a shadow clearly showing it's a sphere. You have no reason not to believe the moon is locked on one side and there are other examples of locked moons in the solar system.

What's up? Are you not able to answer? Let me know! The theory intrigues me, but you are unable to argue your case or provide an answer to my inquiries. What's up?

       The moon is actually very fascinating, I think you should study it a bit. Read something, do some research, don't just think in your old habitual patterns. There is truth to be found, there are awesome discoveries to be made (discoveries as in opening up your own mind, I mean).
