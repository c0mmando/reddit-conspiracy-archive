       Here's a short sample list of mostly pre-pgate topics that I find myself re-posting when trying to convey how very possible, even probable, it is for the pgate allegations to have some merit.  The exceptions, twittergate, the Norway bust, and Monica Peterson's death, happened during pgate's lifetime but only Monica Peterson's death is in any way pgate related.
      </p>
      <p>
       The list is a small sample of well-documented child prostitution/ritual abuse and trafficking incidents by established people in positions of power/trust in society.  If one spends more than a few minutes looking into each of the topics listed below, one realizes there haven't been nearly as many arrests as the number of investigations and victim testimony indicates there should be.  It shouldn't be a far stretch to realize the opportunity for blackmail or the power to be gained by blackmail.   For people to reflexively "pooh-pooh" the idea of pgate and Clinton/Clinton Foundation involvement is what's absurd.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its looking at pgate allegations with events listed below in mind that made alot of p-gaters realize it was more than a little possible the Podestas, Clintons, et.al. could be involved in child sex/trafficking/ritual abuse.  Start looking at the Clintons in that context and all sorts of events/facts starts to pop out

       For what it's worth:
I've often wondered since this all began - are people reacting strongly like they often do to consp. theories in gen. because the overwhelming horror of what they indicate - the smoke leading to/indicating a fire (the very actual long burning fires of Hades in PGs case), evidence/discovery of actual fires in some confirmed conspiracies but still - is it simply because people don't want to entertain, speculate about or discuss Pizza/Pedo G as it is fundamentally too much for them to emotionally, spiritually and psychologically consider or do they want to be taken seriously on the grounds of applying logic, reason, evidence etc....as many citizen investigators and Russian hackers, er sorry, internet sleuths are clearly doing and uncovering enormous quantities of puzzle pieces that are beginning to form a coherent picture when put together with large collections of puzzle pieces from previous eras or incidents such as:
What "Kendall" revealed on Dr. Phil the a couple of days ago confirming what many have known for ever
The Dutroux scandal
The Franklin Boys Town scandal
The Presidio military preschool scandal and other related incidents
The combined history of the catholic church in gen. but specifically their enormous historical involvement in perping and suppressing the evidence of their perping pedo activities on orphaned children in their care
The number of cases world wide but esp. the UK, USA, Canada and historically prominent/important European countries where social services, govt. dept's/agencies/intell./spook, law enforcement have involvement in outright perping and enabling pedo activities for political blackmail and utilisation in ritual abuse scenarios
The mind blowing series Jan Irving of Gnostic Media has been doing with Steve Outtrim on the dark, occult history of Silicon Valley, the 60s counter culture and Burning Man fest.
Dave McGowan: "Programmed to Kill", "Weird Scenes inside the Canyon"
Maury Terry: "Ultimate Evil"
Jay Dyer: "Esoteric Hollywood: Sex, Cults &amp; Symbols in Film"
Peter Levenda: "Unholy Alliance", "Sinister Forces" Trilogy:
Sinister Forces - The Nine: A Grimoire of American Political Witchcraft
Sinister Forces - A Warm Gun: A Grimoire of American Political Witchcraft
Sinister Forces - The Manson Secret: A Grimoire of American Political Witchcraft
Daniel Ryder: "Cover-Up of the Century"
Linda Blood: "The New Satanists"
The overwhelming amount of recorded historical evidence indicating the common practice of these types of rituals by similarly positioned social classes then to who it is suspected is perping it today such as but not limited to Marquis de Sade, Vlad III, Gilles de Rais and amongst the lineage of European Black Nobility who knows how many more. I suspect endless amounts all engaged in similar "pastimes" as the above.
When all these pieces of the puzzle are put together the picture is admittedly overwhelming but it is undeniable, incontrovertible and hard to formulate any other poss. explanation other than Satanic Elite parasites who feed off of the combined emotional, spiritual, financial and physical often negative or lower resonance/frequency energy output of the masses of humanity.
It is people who have developed a coherent understanding and ability to recognise the patterns of reoccurrence and familiarity of ritual, circumstance, synchronicity and evidence that are able to look at the modern day evidence contained in PG and draw likely conclusions.
Not y'all who are often clearly incensed but frankly uninformed casual observer/normie citizen criticizers who are out of your depth and under informed or simply agent provocateurs, shills, algorithm programmed bots or corporate narrative control freak/political/ideologically compromised intell./spook operatives - y'all neither have the gumption, perspective or moral fibre to comment and often in many cases I believe intentionally obfuscate and distract due to your complicity.

      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        a clearly incensed (at the CP allegations/narrative) but frankly uninformed casual observer/normie citizen criticizer
       </li>
       <li>
        an agent provocateur or shill
       </li>
       <li>
        an algorithm programmed bot
       </li>
       <li>
        an agenda driven corporate narrative control freak
       </li>
       <li>
        a politically/ideologically compromised intell./spook operative
       </li>
       <li>
        an active political lobbyist or globalist think tank member
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       or some combo or variation of the above?
      </p>
      <p>
       I suspect not so therefore perhaps you can relax. I'm not talking about you and if you are one of the above then I'm talking about you.

       However what has anything got to do with being Jewish and creepy to boot which is a combination of themes you have introduced to the conversation not me.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe negative Jewish cultural archetypes and the heavily invested in stereotypes, generalizations and outright hateful assertions as to the existence of a Jewish global conspiracy serve to not only continue to utilize them as a useful scapegoated cultural group for all those blinded by hate, ignorance and perceived impotence but also serve as a useful shield and deflection of focus or attention/blame from the rage and energies expressed by many in the wider consp. theory and anti-govt., survivalist, sovereign person-hood movements amongst many other more dysfunctional and anti-social sub groups the world over while those actually responsible for all of the worlds problems at the elite level, groups that yes would of course likely consist of many Jewish members, Germans, French, Swiss, Austrian, British, American, Saudi etc...operate at the supra-cultural or globalist level and do not give a care or identify with any traditional culture, ethnicity or race outside of keeping up appearances and simply look at life in terms of finances, control, power, influence and intelligence as in surveillance/data.
