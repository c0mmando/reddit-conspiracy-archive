       Saying Alex Jones said he's sorry and constantly linking to the video does not equal "Pizzagate is fake". Alex Jones didn't invent pizzagate, so your point is mute. JESSE JACKSON IS NOT THE KING OF BLACK PEOPLE. ALEX JONES IS NOT THE KING OF PIZZAGATE. No person has perpetuated PG more than that seaman guy, and no thing perpetuates PG more than facts.

       Omg this thread is ridiculous. All the pizzagate threads are. You have to be completely lacking in any sort of critical thinking skills to not notice how fucking stupid this shit sounds. Here's a newsflash for you, there's a really small fringe group of people who believe there is anything to "pizzagate" and to everyone else it sounds completely idiotic. Seriously, this is shapeshifting lizard people levels of ridiculous. So when people come in here and say "wow, this is really stupid" it isn't because they are being paid. No one is paying anyone to try and cover up "pizzagate". There's no need anyway, because even when presented with all the supposed evidence and smoking guns, the average person with at least one foot in reality will think this is completely ridiculous. How on Earth you look at any of those images and think they are sexual in nature... Like holy shit really? Do you also think that about the Coppertone kid? Or the child actors in TV ads? There is nothing sexual about those images. A band with the word "sex" in it played at 10pm once? Omfg call the police! Have you never been to a place that hosts small/local bands before? Jesus. You people take all these random, meaningless things and make absurd connections that aren't really there and come up with this ridiculously stupid conspiracy theory and then accuse people who say it's fucking nonsense of being paid shills. I for one know I'm not being paid, I'm just a preschool teacher browsing through reddit in my pajamas on a Sunday morning. The comments in this thread sound completely delusional and I think all of you should probably get off the internet before you lose all touch with reality. Go outside. Talk to other humans, in person. And for fucks sake work on your critical thinking skills.

       Pizzagate consists of a few random, meaningless things like paintings that most people in their right minds would never interpret as being sexual in nature. The ones with kids in bathing suits? To me they look like just kids who are miserable in gym glass. There is nothing remotely sexual about those images. You pizzagate people assign this hidden meaning to it and to all the other things you claim to be "evidence" because you are looking only for things that confirm what you already believe. That's why you only talk to the people who share and reinforce your beliefs, and you call everyone else shills or sheep or brainwashed because you automatically reject anything that doesn't support your story. That is not how critical thinking fucking works. You don't really care about what's true, you care about believing what you already believe. When you compile all the "evidence", until you provide this wild story that assumes all sorts of ridiculous things, it says absolutely nothing. Critical thinking also includes the ability to recognize that if you have to fill in that many blanks in order to explain something then your hypothesis is more than likely bullshit. If you never allow your views to be challenged, then you're not a critical thinker. Point blank.
      </p>
      <p>
       And, yeah, you pizzagate people ARE a fringe group, you just don't think you are because you surround yourselves only with each other. Look how many people showed up to that protest. No one is paying people to "hide" pizzagate because 1) there is nothing to hide in the first place and 2) the vast majority of people, when presented with your "evidence", don't leave thinking there's a secret pedophile ring, they think you're all off your damn rockers. It isn't some great effort by the powers that be to suppress "Pizzagate" that is convincing people it's not true; it is the sheer and utter stupidity of your story. Seriously, for your own good get off the conspiracy websites and forums and actually read things that challenge your views. Talk to people who have different beliefs.

       I'm skeptical on Pizzagate (could be a psy-op) but I'm maintaining an open mind simply due to the fact that other things like this have been exposed in the past from the elite establishment across the world, often times with heavy pushback and denial in the beginning of investigations. It's not impossible something like this could be happening, and there is certainly a lot of circumstantial evidence presented in the community findings. There's no actual hard proof...yet. It hasnt been proven fact or fiction in any way. The fact no formal investigation has even been made into this being a possibility is what really drives it home for me. MSM is so furiously attacking this as "fake news" that it's only adding fuel to the conspiracy fire IMO. I'm hoping there will be more facts and info to come soon so this can be put to bed as either fact or fiction once and for all.

       Circumstancial evidence? What circumstancial evidence? That WordPress site is ridiculous. There is no evidence of anything. That blog with the kids and the pool appears to be your average mommy blog. Sometimes when people talk about swimming pools, they are just talking about swimming pools. Or handkerchiefs. Or fucking pizza. Finding secret  codes and symbols in ordinary, meaningless things and becoming convinced they spell out the truth about some big secret message isn't "evidence", it's schizophrenia. Literally that is what schizophrenic people do. I guarantee you could go to just about any restaurant or corporate chain and find all sorts of images in their logos/websites/etc that vaguely resemble those pedophile secret symbols. It doesn't mean shit. This is all so unbelievably delusional. Omg.

       It's a fact. That the moon's radius is 1737km is also a fact. Both these facts don't contribute anything to the conspiracy theory that involves a pizza place and satanic pedophilia.

       In regards to your link, they've gone and expanded Pizzagate to including any and all pedo incidents worldwide - Which is moronic. It'd be like accusing your neighbour of being a murderer without facts, then saying that people get murdered every day, therefore you should be treated seriously.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Pizzagate is the only one to inspire an orchestrated censorship campaign [8] and obvious collusion between the mainstream media, Google, Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, and YouTube [9]. The cover-up proves conspiracy.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Flat Earthers claim the same.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The Comet Ping Pong website revealed a hidden, password-protected “members only” directory that housed enormous encrypted zip files and provided users with options for uploading and downloading [42]. While certainly a unique feature for a pizza website, such setups are standard operating procedure for child pornography distribution.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Do they know what's in the zip files?
      </p>
      <p>
       Looks like it doesn't matter, pedo's share zip files so thats OBVIOSLY all the proof you need /s
      </p>
      <p>
       That's all these 'proofs' are - Here's something the accused has done, here's something pedo's do, lets try build a bridge from our imagination to connect the two while ignoring any remotely sane alternatives.

       Because 'kids' is a pretty broad range.

       Depending on the age can restrict what you can do, where you can go etc.

       so your first premise there is false, you have stretched the truth to say one story, then when the stretched facts are exposed you cling on to the previous conclusion.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is not logic, this is being emotionally invested in a particular story and giving "facts" and arguments that support that theory leeway and throwing up unnecessary resistance to facts and arguments that oppose it.

      <p>
       Not one person has come forward and said they know her.

      <p>
       We have a clear picture of her We can assume she is from the Washington area and yet no one knows who she is.
      </p>
      <p>
       No parents,no family,No teachers,no doctors,no friends,no friends parents none has come out and said "oh that's so and so,she's in my class,my daughters friend,she's my patient,she's fine ,stop harassing her" not a peep.

       Pizzaboy claims its his goddaughter. If this is true it would be easy to prove and go along way to clearing his name,Far easier than manipulation of the failing legacy media and censorship of the world wide web.

       You are the third person today to use the even Alex Jones doesn't believe it argument. Its almost as if you are reading from the same script as part of coordinated propaganda push. Weird.

       If by that you mean one of the thousands of people around the world that is concerned about pedogate then you're correct .Thanks .

       Nice little bit of xenophobia to end you're post with there.
      </p>
      <p>
       Might I suggest if you think British people are not worth listening to you should maybe not have replied to my post .I mean you figured out I was British decided I wasn't worth listening to then went ahead and replied to my post anyway. You sort of proved your own point wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since you don't think British people are worth listening to I assume you read this response so you won't hear say fuck you. Oh well.

       You're not connecting anything you twat. All you're doing is accusing people of being pedophiles and then demanding others disprove your accusations that you just made up.
      </p>
      <p>
       And pointing out the fact that you're British isn't xenophobia you overly sensitive sissyboy, its just relevant when noting where the accusations are coming from.

       A British citizen claiming American law enforcement officers are engaging in a coverup about a pedophile ring being run by American politicians out of an American restaurant on American soil. With zero proof of any of it.

       I'm skeptical on Pizzagate (could be a psy-op) but I'm maintaining an open mind simply due to the fact that other things like this have been exposed in the past from the elite establishment across the world, often times with heavy pushback and denial in the beginning of investigations. It's not impossible something like this could be happening, and there is certainly a lot of circumstantial evidence presented in the community findings. There's no actual hard proof...yet. It hasnt been proven fact or fiction in any way. The fact no formal investigation has even been made into this being a possibility is what really drives it home for me. MSM is so furiously attacking this as "fake news" that it's only adding fuel to the conspiracy fire IMO. I'm hoping there will be more facts and info to come soon so this can be put to bed as either fact or fiction once and for all.
      </p>

       Investigations are frequently launched by circumstantial evidence to gather more and hard evidence.

       refusing to post pictures of your child relatives to aggressive internet strangers who are demanding details of your personal life is a red flag only for sanity.

       Your "if they've nothing to hide they've nothing to fear" argument however reminds me of how we've wound up in this situation of omnipresent surveillance in the first place.

       Why has no one else came forward to identify the little girl.
      </p>
      <p>
       Many many people outside the family have involvement in a child's life apart from the immediate family. Doctors,teachers,friends,the guy in the local shop. Jimmy can't control everybody.
      </p>
      <p>
       Pedogate is massive. Hundreds of thousands of people around the world have looked into it. Its been on national news .Yet not one person has came forward and said I know this girl. No teachers,no friends ,no neighbours, no one.

       most of these people aren't going to have pictures of the kid, and if they're reasonable adults they'll know better than to give details about somebody else's  kid o the internet.  At least two of those categories would in fact be fired

       its really not that big, you've got a distorted view cause the vote bots on here and t_d upvote the shit outta pizzagate stories, but most people don't know shit about it.  Yeah its been on the news, how many people under the age of 70 you know who watch tv news on the regular?  particularly just off the tv, as opposed to clips that get shared on fb or something.  We live in an age of information overload, we each see different landscapes in the vastness.

       It's possible this is all coming from Russia, who wants to destabilize all powers and alliances keeping Russia from reforming it's former Empire. Russia has decades of intelligence analysis on America and knows how much we care about our kids
       <em>
        and
       </em>
       how paranoid we get about Satanism and Pedophiles.
      </p>

       If I were working for Russian intelligence, I would be actively working to stir up demoralizing, damaging stories against the politician who support NATO so as to help the politician who is friendly to Russia.

       No, I'm not saying that at all. I'm a skeptic of pizzagate in its entirety. I was just suggesting that if that alleged victim in that Dr Phil episode is to be believed then there are kids out there being bred for trafficking that don't think they're victims.

       Epsteins victims have filed a civil suit....

      <p>
       Many of the victims come from war torn or natural disaster devastated areas where there is little or no documentation.  Laura Silsby got caught smuggling 33 victims out of Haiti. There was another recent bust in Haiti with even more victims.

       That's a bit of an exaggerated point to take, but even stil, that is called
       <strong>
        confirmation bias
       </strong>
       . Only people still living can speak. We don't know if all these actors/famous people that died in the last year were about to uncover some serious shit, for example, before they died from 'heart attacks', 'drug overdoses', and 'suicides'. I'm not saying that's definitely the case but you get the point I'm sure.

       I think there's something to this whole thing.  I think some people took it too far and are fucking it up, hopefully with good intentions, but still fucking it up regardless.  Right now though, I'm mostly just here to check up a bit on the whole thing.  I can't help but find it strange though, that you use the line "Yet hear we are, talking about it," to try and make a point.  You r using an insult to knock down people who are still here working through it, because they must be idiots, because this thing is so dead, right?  Did you miss the "we" in your insult?  If these people here are soooo stupid to be here, because this thing is so dead it's useless, what the fuck are you doing here in this "we?" Do you think your superior intellect will save these people from themselves when nothing else has so far or are you just here to slam people? Maybe its something else I'm missing?

       I recently heard something on the news that referenced Pedogate, and they briefly explained it but then hurriedly said "which is false." Ummmm, last time I checked American journalism had the problem of giving too much credence to opposing viewpoints, even when the opposing side is ridiculous. Since when do journalists come down hard against anything?

HIGH PRIEST at Comet Ping Pong.   Hired by GEORGE SOROS as a hired protester.  I searched as far as I can go and found no current address. There are a lot of addresses in and around DC. I paid for this search. I wish I had more to offer.

       37 post karma. Posts on r/esist. Month old acc.  And most damming of all, is just generally a rude sounding person. That should really bother you. Are you this rude to everyone in telling them they are wrong? You are just... Rude lol.

       There shouldn't be people automatically attacking each other due to where they post.  Just because someone posts in resist, the_donald, politics, metacanada, etc... doesn't mean anything other than that person has a bias, and that should be taken into account but not used as an attack.  I've fallen victim to that kind of thinking in the past, but I've realized falling into that kind of thinking is just lazy and blinding me to what people might be saying.

Wow, I'm interested to see how much more of this shit I take before FakeIt cough whoops Reddit - becomes nothing more than a 30 second descriptor while describing some fun old things we used to do on the net in the olden days. I'm getting too old to waste untold amounts of energy trying to not get brainwashed or tricked, and am I in touch with reality when using this site lmao...Shit this site is supposed to be recreational, not feel like fucking WORK HAHA

       I do not know if Podesta, Alefantis and the others mentioned in the PG emails are truly pedophiles, there isn't anything solid to claim they are but there is a lot of circumstantial evidence that makes these guys look like pedophiles though.
      </p>
      <p>
       The best thing about PG for me however, is how it's bringing the very real child trafficking scene that exists within government and the entertainment industry to light.

       You do realize a lot of different groups hire people to go on Reddit for a variety of different reasons, right?  There are people here that are paid to make Monsanto look good, make Taco Bell look good, make Trump look good, make Putin look good, make Bernie look good, push Mormonism and keep an eye on all Mormons, etc...  It's a heavily viewed site so there are a lot of people paid to influence the direction of dialogue here.  The traffic is monstrous, so why wouldn't you expect them to be here?

       The thing is I can see why a business would use shills to sell their products, but I can't understand why anyone would need shills to go against PizzaGate. Wouldn't a criminal investigation be a better defense against PizzaGate if you were innocent? If you have nothing to hide then you should welcome an investigation... not that I agree with that, but it's the same argument our politicians have used to support the unconstitutional spying done by the CIA and the NSA.

       You're basing it off the assumption that it's just everyday normal people pushing pizzagate against an army of shills trying to stop it, without considering the possibility that it's an army of shills trying to push pizzagate against normal everyday people trying to stop it.  More than likely it's mostly shills on both sides fighting against each other with regular people just getting caught up in it.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for shills in general, I doubt they have teams that target one specific thing(like Pizzagate or the Trump Dossier) but instead push a general agenda that benefits their side while weakening the other side.

       If I was suspicious you might be hiding something and decided the format of your posts meant you were engaging in child trafficking, would you consent to a criminal investigation right now?  The nothing to hide excuse is bunk, exactly like you said, so why even advocate it?

       I advocate it because they apparently like the policy. After all, it's their fault it is our policy. I hate it, but if they like it they should be fine with the search. Hope you're ok with that answer.

       see but they've already demonstrated, by misinterpreting innocuous messages as criminal conspiracy, that no matter how innocent the facts you show them that these accusers will see pedophilia* in it.
      </p>
      <p>
       And many are so convinced that any evidence of innocence will be taken out of hand as evidence of attempted cover-up.

       mobs are basically by definition blood hungry, the eusocial beast we humans form together like an ugly pancake voltron is clumsy and  violent and prone to screaming rage.
      </p>
      <p>
       and there plenty of reason for pizzagate's targets to fear the mob
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       blood hungry, a man already went into comet ping pong with a
       <em>
        gun
       </em>
       .  So thats score one for "pizzagate believing nuts may show up and shoot you" while "pizzagate believers are reasonable people and the facts are indisputable" is still sitting at zero.
      </p>
      <p>
       and pedophiles are, rightly, vilified and reviled, being accused of being one is a smear and a stink that cannot be easily washed off no matter how baseless the accusation.
      </p>
      <p>
       people like to think that they are heroes.  they also want to perform horrible atrocities, but they want to be justified and heroic in doing them.  Killing pedophiles is a fantasy which neatly satisfies these requirements  For this reason the pizzagate story has no doubt captured the hopes and dreams of a number of wannabe violent sociopaths.  And people who
       <em>
        like
       </em>
       a story become invested in believing in it, and once that happens no evidence that contradicts that story will ever to change their mind.

       I'm skeptical on Pizzagate (could be a psy-op) but I'm maintaining an open mind simply due to the fact that other things like this have been exposed in the past from the elite establishment across the world, often times with heavy pushback and denial in the beginning of investigations. It's not impossible something like this could be happening, and there is certainly a lot of circumstantial evidence presented in the community findings. There's no actual hard proof...yet. It hasnt been proven fact or fiction in any way. The fact no formal investigation has even been made into this being a possibility is what really drives it home for me. MSM is so furiously attacking this as "fake news" that it's only adding fuel to the conspiracy fire IMO. I'm hoping there will be more facts and info to come soon so this can be put to bed as either fact or fiction once and for all.

       Hmm, I don't think I understand your point, then. You are saying special interest groups hire shills, and you're not surprised they are hired to suppress pizzagate? That wasn't what I interpreted from your first comment.

       Edit: he seemed only incredulous about the fact that they were bothering to suppress pizzagate. That the suppression actually makes it seem more plausible as opposed to less plausible.

       I wish they'd realize this shit is not effective when they're so obvious about it that people are constantly being alerted to what they're doing. It almost seems like they WANT people to know and they WANT people to hate them.

       What they're really doing is selecting for (in the evolutionary sense) forum ecosystems stuffed to the gills with countertrolls who find them amusing.  The shills create a hell of their own design - a forum that is everything they made of it, but tuned to antagonize them personally.

       There's really no need to make it a partisan issue.  Not this.  The two parties are very often running controlled opposition games to create false choices and ensure nothing
       <em>
        really
       </em>
       changes for the people at the top.  This might well be one of the status quo elements they were protecting with their false choice games.  In any case, it doesn't need to be partisan, because it inherently persuades people in a contrapartisan way.  Expose Republicans doing this shit and the internet will turn against them hard, too.  Expose
       <em>
        anyone
       </em>
       doing this shit and the internet will turn against them.  James Alefantis' Instagram would be a persuasive marvel against anyone.  Having a creepy pedo subculture presence on social media is political kryptonite.

       I agree totally. But when I look into the shilling these are basically HRC aka Establishment Dems shillers (paid?). They have failed to get beyond the petty partisanship.
      </p>

       This is elitist vs the mass. The issue is more related to debauchery, lechery of the elite than their political alignments.

       could you reread those emails, but this time don't read the little "legend" on the side first.

       fact is with a large enough selection of your writing i could create a similar box of code words and make a passable go of showing that you were in fact secretly queen elizabeth and had personally shot jfk.

       Do you think it's practical and plausible for Russian agents to plant all those weird IG posts, put a pedo symbol in a restaurant logo, incept the Podestas to buy twisted quasi-pedophillic art, then leak emails containing code talk that brings it all together???
      </p>
      <p>
       That's just stupid. A more plausible explanation is that a string of rich person eccentricities and sinister-seeming language in leaked emails caused conspiracy theorists to draw fantastic conclusions about the people involved. So why the fuck wouldn't you stick with that talking point instead of this ridiculous Russian narrative? I wonder what the balance of probabilities are on that...

       highlighted the things i consider to be huge assumptions, the interpretation of which drastically alters perception of ht whole business, though i'd like to see a source from before the pizzagate copypasta that shows blue triangles to actually be pedo symbols in the first place.
      </p>
      <p>
       heres a theory, russian propaganda agents leaked (some evidence suggests altered as well) podesta's emails.  Deciding they weren't incriminating enough to smear the democrats with, as was desirable since they were trying to prop up donnie dumbshit, they made up a highly incriminating interpretation of some office jokes about pizza.  Which was probably code for weed come to think about it, i always buy mine by the "slice" or 1/8th.  This disinformation was fortified with images of some creepy looking art podesta bought and some unverified and extremely circumstantial and tenuous links to random child disappearances.  This whole business was compiled into an easily spread meme image and disseminated anonymously through 4chan.
      </p>
      <p>
       4chan, being the sort of place people go and post cp, has a large population of users who are in deep denial about their own disgusting urges or why they're surfing /b, and this population latched onto to this story cause it has everything their fevered imaginations most secretly fantasize about: people in positions of power abusing kids with impunity.  So it caught and it spread.
      </p>
      <p>
       Compare that with the difficulty that would be involved in
       <em>
        actually
       </em>
       running an elite pedo ring, you just can't reliably hire that many sociopaths and pedos, and keeping it quiet on top of that?  And not to mention sociopaths will turn on you
       <em>
        before
       </em>
       the first opportunity, and pedos are basically by definition in a position of weakness and vulnerability which is highly exploitable.

       should at least suggest to any rational person that elite pedo rings absolutely exist. The fact there are so many instances to draw upon from recent history should suggest that maybe it's not all that hard either--as long as you have money and powerful friends.

       That is the problem about what this whole sub is all about. The idea of witch hunts and justice are so far from reality on our level, unless we keep talking about it more and more. Even then, there is no promise. The fact is, this genre of thinking could never have a true advocate. As a conscious indivisual, they are bound to have differing opinions. There are no leaders in truth. Some do have more listeners, sure, but that does not make them the bearer of all truth.

       He's rich as hell.  He can affort to suffer a frivolous lawsuit.  Since he's not, that means that Alex Jones has come to the conclusion that "belief in pizzagate" is not something you can defend in court.

       I know most of the people here have their minds made up already, and tend to downvote dissenting opinion, but I'll give you my thoughts on this regardless.
      </p>
      <p>
       First, it's quite clear that Jones was threatened by a lawsuit.  They've more or less openly said that this was done for legal reasons.
      </p>
      <p>
       He's rich as hell. He can afford to suffer a frivolous lawsuit as long as he wins.  But he's not trying.  That means that Alex Jones has come to the conclusion that "belief in pizzagate" is not something you can defend in court.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not just that you couldn't prove it in court, but that you couldn't defend belief in it.
      </p>
      <p>
       So now one of the most prominent voices defending the Pizzagate conspiracy still does not believe that it is defensible enough to actually risk anything for it.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's not proof of anything.  But it did validate my interpretation of the evidence, which came to the same conclusion.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think that this whole thing started out as a smear campaign with elements of moral panic from gullible people.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I'm not the only person who believes that.  You're going to see vehement opposition from people who are politically aligned with the people being smeared, because they feel these attacks are baseless and politically motivated.

       That's an excellent point. Journalists have a significant amount of privilege when it comes to defamation, as long their statements were made in good faith and without "actual malice." This even applies if their statements are later proven to be false.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also worth noting that a retraction can be used as an affirmative defense against a defamation claim. Probably wouldn't be enough to get him off the hook entirely, but might help mitigate the damage in the event he lost.​​

       Courts do this all the time.  It proves nothing but that the judge would likely jail a sincere defendant in contempt.  Our fallen judiciary projects their own contempt of the process onto any defendants ripe for scapegoating, which Alex Jones certainly is.

       I think a few conspiracies are a little wooohooo.....out there. I never bother to read threads about them or comment. Who legitimately feels the need to berate, belittle and contradict every nuance of a conspiracy they don't take seriously? That's not real people.

       I think the answer to your WHY? is that the longer the internet spends investigating elite pedophiles, the more David Brock gets to look either like a laughingstock or a monster (depending on whether or not there's fire to go with all the smoke).  Either of those reputations would suffice on its own to motivate the hiring of people to shill against pizzagate.  If David Brock can't control his own reputation, the wealthy people who hire him to control
       <em>
        their
       </em>
       reputations will lose faith in him.

       It's pretty clear that "PizzaGate" is one of the more crazy conspiracies that the machine is trying to ramp up in order to distract from the Russian counterintelligence investigation.

       Because there is a possibility that it isn't the Russians? I understand the possibility that it could be, but find it very difficult to say with certainty that it was them. Regardless, if Russia was responsible for the leaks, does that make the allegations any less heinous?

       I suppose I see what you are getting at. You think Russia just needed to plant the seed by aiding the leaks to begin with and then let things snowball from there? I admit this is a possibility, but will remain skeptical for the time being. I will have a very hard time buying into the DNC/MSM's narrative, which you are pushing. What I said earlier stands. I don't care who leaked if the implications are factual and allow the public to be more informed of the possibilities of the inner workings of our government. I do believe the truth will set us free regardless of who is telling it, as long as it is the truth. :)

       Wait so now pizzagate is Russian spy ops too? These Russians are so powerful. Literally hacking the election and having trump win. They can do everything. Oh yeah and don't mind the USA who killed 200 people in an airstrike in Iraq a few days ago, and the CIA who can hack you as hard as the NSA. These guys do it for the good guys, yeah, they'll protect us from the scary Russians.

       Did the Russians put a pedo symbol in the Best Pizza logo, or post really weird shit on Alefantis' Instagram, or paint bizarre murals depicting decapitation on a family restaurant wall? Maybe they were behind the infamous #killroom, the 4chan pedo key, and the mysterious code talk in the Podesta emails. Maybe they're the ones that gave the description of the McCann kidnapping suspects to the police sketch artists, you know for use years later after they co-opted Trump to make a nearly unbelievable run for the presidency.
      </p>
      <p>
       PG developed spontaneously, took on a life of its own, and doesn't need bad state actors to keep it alive. Claiming Russia is behind it for any reason is fucking stupid.

       Not everyone is. But when the exact same statements come up over &amp; over you can tell it's like reading from a script.
      </p>
      <p>
       My favorite is "there's no evidence"... except the Podesta emails, the Alefantis IG, the weird symbols in Besta &amp; related restaurants, missing children, the catholic church's proven track record of molesting kids... there is evidence. But then these "Redditors" say it's not real evidence. Okay so they're choosing to ignore all the evidence presented
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GZFHLAcG8A">
        by Ben Swann
       </a>
       in a clean-cut format. If this has enough evidence for someone from MSM to cover it then there is at least some evidence. When people call this a baseless conspiracy with no evidence it's highly suspicious IMO.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you've seen the evidence and don't believe it amounts to much, fair enough.
      </p>
      <p>
       But the two talking points that constantly get parroted are "there's
       <strong>
        no
       </strong>
       evidence", implying literally no evidence exists when some does, and the classic "the IG photos were just a joke".
      </p>
      <p>
       When I see those comments
       <em>
        repeatedly
       </em>
       in the same thread by random users it's astroturfing. The more you read the same arguments ad nauseam you'll start to notice. Not to mention posters who use blanket insults against this sub(why are they here?).
      </p>
      <p>
       Bottom line: no they're not all shills and it's not because they disagree. It's the specific way they disagree, almost like pre-written talking points, that makes certain threads seem incredibly shady.

       Nonsense. Pizzagate developed organically from conclusions drawn from real life things. Weird instagram posts, twisted art and performances, code talk in emails, a pedo symbol in a pizza logo--you literally can't make this shit up.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only "the Russians did it" argument you could possibly make here is that after Pizzagate took off, they hired shills/turfers to keep it alive, but honestly I don't think something as sensational as this really needs help to stay alive.

       anyone who deligimitizes all their opposition as paid without refuting their points obviously is standing on very shaky ground and is merely deflecting. The entire premise of the conspiracy from a logical non emotional viewpoint is ridiculous so of course initially people are going to attack it as absurd, half the proponents of it think it is actual satanists doing everything, of course nobody is going to take it seriously the only satanists around are edgy atheists getting a rise out of fundies.

        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temple_of_Set
       </a>
       ; "The Temple of Set is an occult initiatory order founded in 1975. A new religious movement and form of Western esotericism, the Temple espouses a religion known as Setianism, whose practitioners are called Setians. This is sometimes identified as a form of Satanism, although this term is not often embraced by Setians and is contested by some academics.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Temple was established in the United States in 1975 by Michael Aquino, an American political scientist, military officer, and a high-ranking member of Anton LaVey's Church of Satan. Dissatisfied with the direction in which LaVey was taking the Church, Aquino resigned and – according to his own claim – embarked on a ritual to invoke Satan, who revealed to him a sacred text called The Book of Coming Forth by Night. According to Aquino, in this work Satan revealed his true name to be Set, which had been the name used by his followers in ancient Egypt. Aquino was joined in establishing the Temple by a number of other dissatisfied members of LaVey's Church, and soon various Setian groups were established across the United States." ;

       I honestly think "pizzagate" is the great rubicon of conspiracy. I hate the name "pizzagate" but i think there is truly something there. People need to talk about this. There are numerous cases popping up overseas of trafficking rings being busted, with big players involved. What? Are we just so fucking star spangled awesome that we wouldn't have the same issue? But of course we dont talk about this. Do you know anyone who could tell you how many children go missing globally in a month of the top of their head? How about nationally? How about in your own fucking state? Now how many people do you know who could tell you how many people died from a terrorist attack in london off the top of their head

       Personally, I think the great rubicon of conspiracy has to do with ET visitation of Earth, and full public ET disclosure. Pizzagate is up there alright, but even if arrests are made, charges pressed, and convictions served, it will be a big deal, but I don't think it would be too groundbreaking in the grand scheme of things. We know pedophile rings have been around for millennia, and probably will continue to pop up in the future, in spite of our efforts. Full public ET disclosure on the other hand has the potential to radically accelerate our species technological development, especially when it comes to clean energy and interstellar travel.

       If high level officials who have "authority" were proven to be molesting children and lying about it, that would absolutely be groundbreaking and it would affect every single person in the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       Everyone would need to realize that people in power lie. They did lie, and in that scenario they lied about something that would go beyond mafia level crimes. The average person would need to seriously question what authority even means. Why were these people trusted in the first place? Why did the average person think they were "normal" and trust them, give them power, etc?
      </p>
      <p>
       I agree that topics like ET, life after death, higher dimensions, what is consciousness... these are more significant than satanic elite practices. But to say it wouldn't be "too groundbreaking" if well known politicians were literally arrested and convicted of this? No my dude. That would be one of the most groundbreaking events in centuries.

      <p>
       It would be significant, that's for sure, but I mean to say it wouldn't come as much of a shock at this point. Elite pedophile rings are nothing new, and politicians have been arrested and convicted of this type of stuff before. Plus, we already know about some of the bizarre, I guess you could call 'satanic' practices that some of the elite engage in at the Bilderberg meetings and whatnot.
      </p>
      <p>
       We may see the arrests of Podesta and a few fall guys, but it's unlikely that we'll get them all, unfortunately. Pizzagate, pedogate, elite pedophilia, whatever you want to call it, is a type of evil we'll probably have to rage against for years to come, and we may never get a true sense of closure. I hope I'm wrong.

       I'm skeptical on Pizzagate (could be a psy-op) but I'm maintaining an open mind simply due to the fact that other things like this have been exposed in the past from the elite establishment across the world, often times with heavy pushback and denial in the beginning of investigations. It's not impossible something like this could be happening, and there is certainly a lot of circumstantial evidence presented in the community findings. There's no actual hard proof...yet. It hasnt been proven fact or fiction in any way. The fact no formal investigation has even been made into this being a possibility is what really drives it home for me. MSM is so furiously attacking this as "fake news" that it's only adding fuel to the conspiracy fire IMO. I'm hoping there will be more facts and info to come soon so this can be put to bed as either fact or fiction once and for all.
      </p>
      <p>
       Investigations are frequently launched by circumstantial evidence to gather more and hard evidence.

       It is under control. The CIA admitted in a court of law in the 70s that they influence US MSM, and perhaps others. This was Operation Mockingbird. It was discontinued, but may have been revamped under a new name, pushed further underground, and expanded ten-fold, like many other "discontinued" CIA operations. There's also Bill Clintons 1996 Telecommunications Act that lead to 5 mega corporations controlling at least 90% of the US MSM, and made the FCC toothless against them.

       They think because Alex Jones was forced to say sorry under threat of legal action that means we will stop pushing pedogate.

       Alex Jones didn't come up with pizzagate.
      </p>
      <p>
       He has always been worried about reporting on it.
      </p>
      <p>
       When ever he mentions pedogate he makes it very clear that he thinks Pedo point pong is a distraction.
      </p>
      <p>
       To an extent he's right.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hillary Clinton and Jon pedoesta doh not rape children AT Comet pizza. This is the most extreme version of the pizzagate theory and the one pushed by the media so I think its safe to that it doesn't happen.

       I think you mean "your point is moot."
      </p>
      <p>
       Mute refers to a lack of sound. When we mute our TVs the sound is turned off. A deaf-mute is someone who cannot hear and cannot speak.
      </p>
      <p>
       A moot point is one open to debate though it is not used that way, at least in the US. But in its common usage it refers to a question that doesn't need to be discussed or is not open to debate. While you are describing a weak or inconsequential argument and not the debatability of a point, your usage isn't too far removed from that common usage.

       This is real simple folks.
      </p>
      <p>
       No person or entity spends $$$ smearing and trying to delegitimise shit that plain and simple is not true.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sure, there are trillion dollar corps that would put out a campaign to counteract bad PR even if it wasn't the truth, for no other reason than to save face and make sure the public doesn't fall for the rumor or misinformation.
      </p>
      <p>
       BUT, when they spend millions of $$$, what can ultimately be MILLIONS of man hours, to try and delegitimise a subject that in the grand scheme, is ONLY being quietly discussed in the farthest corners of the internet and basically NOWHERE else on Earth...Idk guys, doesn't that in ITSELF prove the disputed "subject" true? Didn't your mama teach you "Doth thou protest too much"!
      </p>
      <p>
       The MSM and members of the elite are protesting WAYYYYYY too much.
      </p>
      <p>
       Downvote me to the bottom see if I give a fuck! MORE people need to speak their opinion more frankly so that the discussions around here can try and liven up some! Were waging a war with the paid shills and bots, the least we can do so using this site doesn't have to feel like work is to try and present all our different ideas and thoughts? Well I do and if I'm wrong well fuck I guess Reddit finally shit the bed.

       I'm skeptical on Pizzagate (could be a psy-op) but I'm maintaining an open mind simply due to the fact that other things like this have been exposed in the past from the elite establishment across the world, often times with heavy pushback and denial in the beginning of investigations. It's not impossible something like this could be happening, and there is certainly a lot of circumstantial evidence presented in the community findings. There's no actual hard proof...yet. It hasnt been proven fact or fiction in any way. The fact no formal investigation has even been made into this being a possibility is what really drives it home for me. MSM is so furiously attacking this as "fake news" that it's only adding fuel to the conspiracy fire IMO. I'm hoping there will be more facts and info to come soon so this can be put to bed as either fact or fiction once and for all.
      </p>
      <p>
       Investigations are frequently launched by circumstantial evidence to gather more and hard evidence.

       I dont want to imply any conclusion to this but in general promoting someone artificially to the "leader" of an idea or movement only with the intent to smear them immediately and have a chilling effect on the idea/group is becoming the best option for people, whether they realize the process or not

       I consistently question on pedogate posts and I'm not getting paid for it. People don't need to be hired to discredit some of the accusations. 500 lost or missing children is not proof of a massive government coverup of a pedophile ring in DC, I don't have to get a paycheck to say that.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not saying there's no underground child sex rings out there, and won't discount people who are actually investigating them...But when someone walks into a pizza place with a gun to free the children it was time to step back a bit.

       We should absolutely question all things. I agree with a lot of what you said.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for Edgar Welsh the shooter, people questioned him from the beginning as do I. Welsh is an actor and had been involved with a hit and run in August, I believe, that he wasn't jailed for. Maybe a deal was made and it was a false flag attack.
      </p>
      <p>
       As crazy as ^ that sounds, with the precedent of cover ups and corruption right here it becomes much more plausable, I think.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I tell people all the time, the damning evidence doesn't lie in a pizza place, its in the organizations that these politicians support. Like Hilary and her Baptist Orphanages in the Domincan Republic that steal babies from Haiti.

       Just a note on the Clinton/Silsby emails, assisting American citizens jailed in foreign countries is something the Delartment of State handles pretty seriously. Clinton receiving emails about the shady movement of children out of Haiti and the subsequent arrests/trials isn't very far fetched.

       Omg this thread is ridiculous. All the pizzagate threads are. You have to be completely lacking in any sort of critical thinking skills to not notice how fucking stupid this shit sounds. Here's a newsflash for you, there's a really small fringe group of people who believe there is anything to "pizzagate" and to everyone else it sounds completely idiotic. Seriously, this is shapeshifting lizard people levels of ridiculous. So when people come in here and say "wow, this is really stupid" it isn't because they are being paid. No one is paying anyone to try and cover up "pizzagate". There's no need anyway, because even when presented with all the supposed evidence and smoking guns, the average person with at least one foot in reality will think this is completely ridiculous. How on Earth you look at any of those images and think they are sexual in nature... Like holy shit really? Do you also think that about the Coppertone kid? Or the child actors in TV ads? There is nothing sexual about those images. A band with the word "sex" in it played at 10pm once? Omfg call the police! Have you never been to a place that hosts small/local bands before? Jesus. You people take all these random, meaningless things and make absurd connections that aren't really there and come up with this ridiculously stupid conspiracy theory and then accuse people who say it's fucking nonsense of being paid shills. I for one know I'm not being paid, I'm just a preschool teacher browsing through reddit in my pajamas on a Sunday morning. The comments in this thread sound completely delusional and I think all of you should probably get off the internet before you lose all touch with reality. Go outside. Talk to other humans, in person. And for fucks sake work on your critical thinking skills.

       mobs are basically by definition blood hungry, the eusocial beast we humans form together like an ugly pancake voltron is clumsy and  violent and prone to screaming rage.
      </p>
      <p>
       and there plenty of reason for pizzagate's targets to fear the mob
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       blood hungry, a man already went into comet ping pong with a
       <em>
        gun
       </em>
       .  So thats score one for "pizzagate believing nuts may show up and shoot you" while "pizzagate believers are reasonable people and the facts are indisputable" is still sitting at zero.
      </p>
      <p>
       and pedophiles are, rightly, vilified and reviled, being accused of being one is a smear and a stink that cannot be easily washed off no matter how baseless the accusation.
      </p>
      <p>
       people like to think that they are heroes.  they also want to perform horrible atrocities, but they want to be justified and heroic in doing them.  Killing pedophiles is a fantasy which neatly satisfies these requirements  For this reason the pizzagate story has no doubt captured the hopes and dreams of a number of wannabe violent sociopaths.  And people who
       <em>
        like
       </em>
       a story become invested in believing in it, and once that happens no evidence that contradicts that story will ever to change their mind.

      <p>
       If high level officials who have "authority" were proven to be molesting children and lying about it, that would absolutely be groundbreaking and it would affect every single person in the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       Everyone would need to realize that people in power lie. They did lie, and in that scenario they lied about something that would go beyond mafia level crimes. The average person would need to seriously question what authority even means. Why were these people trusted in the first place? Why did the average person think they were "normal" and trust them, give them power, etc?
      </p>
      <p>
       I agree that topics like ET, life after death, higher dimensions, what is consciousness... these are more significant than satanic elite practices. But to say it wouldn't be "too groundbreaking" if well known politicians were literally arrested and convicted of this? No my dude. That would be one of the most groundbreaking events in centuries.

       highlighted the things i consider to be huge assumptions, the interpretation of which drastically alters perception of ht whole business, though i'd like to see a source from before the pizzagate copypasta that shows blue triangles to actually be pedo symbols in the first place.
      </p>
      <p>
       heres a theory, russian propaganda agents leaked (some evidence suggests altered as well) podesta's emails.  Deciding they weren't incriminating enough to smear the democrats with, as was desirable since they were trying to prop up donnie dumbshit, they made up a highly incriminating interpretation of some office jokes about pizza.  Which was probably code for weed come to think about it, i always buy mine by the "slice" or 1/8th.  This disinformation was fortified with images of some creepy looking art podesta bought and some unverified and extremely circumstantial and tenuous links to random child disappearances.  This whole business was compiled into an easily spread meme image and disseminated anonymously through 4chan.
      </p>
      <p>
       4chan, being the sort of place people go and post cp, has a large population of users who are in deep denial about their own disgusting urges or why they're surfing /b, and this population latched onto to this story cause it has everything their fevered imaginations most secretly fantasize about: people in positions of power abusing kids with impunity.  So it caught and it spread.
      </p>
      <p>
       Compare that with the difficulty that would be involved in
       <em>
        actually
       </em>
       running an elite pedo ring, you just can't reliably hire that many sociopaths and pedos, and keeping it quiet on top of that?  And not to mention sociopaths will turn on you
       <em>
        before
       </em>
       the first opportunity, and pedos are basically by definition in a position of weakness and vulnerability which is highly exploitable.
