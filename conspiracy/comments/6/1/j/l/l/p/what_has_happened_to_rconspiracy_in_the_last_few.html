        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;ve noticed that since Alex Jones came out with his denial of &quot;pizzagate&quot; there has been an influx of people on the subreddit who shit on any conspiracy. The best way that I can put it is it&#39;s like suddenly there are a lot of people here who think the government loves us, wants to protect us, has never, ever done anything bad to any civilians, and the only conspiracy going on is Donald Trump and Russia, so shut up about &quot;pizzagate&quot; and talk about Donald Trump and Russia. Has anyone else noticed this? I mean, I&#39;m seeing people say things like, &quot;Pizzagate isn&#39;t real because it&#39;s ridiculous. There are no sex trafficking rings in Washington DC. It&#39;s ridiculous to suggest politicians would be involved in such a thing. There&#39;s no evidence to suggest anyone in our political system is involved with pedophiles or would ever sexually assault anyone.&quot; </p>

<p>You know, except for people like Dennis Hastert, Jeffrey Epstein, their relationship with the Clintons and the Podestas, who have relationships with David Brock and James Alefantis, Alefantis who sexualizes children on his Instagram and Twitter feeds. But that&#39;s all circumstantial, so that means there&#39;s nothing there. Sure, Bill Clinton flew 26 times on the Lolita Express to Epstein&#39;s private island, but when Epstein was sodomizing children, Bill went into the other room. Not Donald Trump, though. When Epstein raped an underage girl, Donald Trump joined right in and it&#39;s totally believable because &quot;Trump is literally Hitler.&quot; But not Bill Clinton, no sir. Bill Clinton would <em>never</em>, ever force himself on anyone. It&#39;s not like he has had to pay any kind of settlements to &quot;victims&quot; or anything, right?</p>

<p>Right...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your method of debate is to sling insults around like a child. You&#39;re just upset about the whole pedogate thing because it makes you feel uncomfortable and so, to reduce the discomfort you feel you are overcompensating by lashing out at everyone who says anything contrary to your programming. If you say everyone else&#39;s grip on reality is weak, that means that your view of reality is the proper view of reality.</p>

<p>The proposition is that there are some elites who rape children and who are involved in trafficking rings. To prove this point evidence was offered. There are dozens of examples of those within the power structure, both in the US and abroad, who are involved in such sordid affairs. This is objectively true.</p>

<p>Your counter proposition is, &quot;Fuck you, you&#39;re stupid, I am smarter, you are delusional, get a grip on reality.&quot;</p>

<p>Not a clear, concise refutation of everything presented in support of the claim, just ad hominems and fallacies. Now, of course <em>you</em> justify this intellectual laziness by saying making an actual argument isn&#39;t worth your time because of how you perceive the topic to be so ridiculous. You can of course insult everyone and troll these message boards, you have time for that, but you can&#39;t actually formulate a reasonable, intelligible argument to support what you believe.</p>

<p>Anyway, while I would agree it&#39;s ridiculous to suggest that Clinton ran a sex dungeon in a pizza parlor, I would say it&#39;s not ridiculous to suggest Brock, Alefantis, Podesta, and others are involved in some sordid affairs, especially given the mountains of circumstantial evidence combined with their association with known pedophiles like Hastert, Sandusky, and Epstein. I know you don&#39;t care about any of that, I know that right now you are straining, laughing to yourself in a sort&#39;ve reassuring, albeit uncomfortable way, as you say over and over, &quot;This guy is crazy, this guy is stupid, I&#39;m the smart one, Ignorance is strength...&quot; </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>How about go do something with your fucking life.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I am. What you are doing is what we call a fallacy. See, I can do it, too to shut down your argument without having to actually address it. Watch.</p>

<h2>Why don&#39;t you go do something with your fucking life!</h2>

<p>See? I sure showed you.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You like Trump good for you.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I never said that.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Whining on the internet won&#39;t help. It&#39;s not a fucking conspiracy. He goes golfing too much.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Never brought that up, either.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There&#39;s fucked up shit right in front of your face you should be doing stuff about. Stuff in your city. On your doorstep. And you ignore it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Do, I though? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>To be a internet detective that&#39;s knows nothing about fuck all.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Hmm...</p>

<blockquote>
<h2><strong>knows nothing about fuck all.</strong></h2>
</blockquote>

<p>Says the guy slinging around ad hominems and fallacies rather than addressing the topic? Mk.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Get. A fucking. Life. Start worrying about yourself and how to be good to people. Not your madness you have now.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I would say that you should take your advice. You are an ignorant person. What I mean by that is you have a very limited understanding of the world around you. How many books have you read in your life? How much do you know about US and world history? Really? Beyond what you can repeat from watching History Channel, or what Anderson Cooper told you to think on CNN? You are the product of indoctrination and conditioning. You cannot conceive of anything that you haven&#39;t already been conditioned to believe in. You lack imagination, you lack an unquestioning mind. I do not mean this to be an insult, it&#39;s just an observation. It&#39;s objectively true that there are those within the political power structure who are criminals and who are pedophiles. We know it for a fact. Your incredibly emotional response indicates a strong desire to reduce the cognitive dissonance this information causes you.</p>

<p>My advice to you would be to read more books. Broaden your view. </p>

<p>How can you confidently say Alex Jones isn&#39;t controlled opposition? Don&#39;t you think &quot;TPTB&quot; would want a gatekeeper like Jones?

    <div class="md"><p>Alex Jones sells products. The products he sells cater to a specific market, conspiracy theorists and survivalists and doomsday preppers and militia types. None of that is bad in itself, this is simply an observation.</p>

<p>Alex Jones disseminates information about the government, conspiracies, some of which are true, that helps sell those products. No finer example of that than his Y2K fear mongering, talking about Russia launching ICBMs at the United States. I&#39;m sure he sold quite a few survival kits back then, and that was when he didn&#39;t have as large an operation as he has now. So, how convenient then for Jones that he has amassed for himself a base of viewers prepping for the end of the world, or civil unrest, all who listen to him spout tales of the end of the world and the oncoming civil unrest.</p>

<p>Now, again, he may be right. There might be a doomsday approaching. I kinda think there is. The world is becoming increasingly more chaotic and hostile. But the point is that Alex Jones doesn&#39;t care about that. Alex Jones cares about selling you body armor, and vitamin supplements and iodine tablets. If Alex Jones <em>actually</em> cared, if he really believed he was doing God&#39;s work in a fight against Lucifer who is using child sacrificing elites, why would he back down over a simple legal order? If his soul is on the line, why stop at a legal order? I don&#39;t believe he means it when he says &quot;1776 will commence again if you try and take our guns,&quot; because all anyone has to do is serve him with a cease and desist order and he&#39;ll piss his pants.</p>

<p>Alex Jones now runs a highly sophisticated news program with one of the tightest NDAs in the business. He runs a multimillion dollar business peddling shit and conspiracies. He is well read, he knows his stuff, but he doesn&#39;t really care about it. He is an actor playing a character and part of his job is to be informed. So, he read Quigley, he read Kissinger, he read Gardner, he read all these different people, and he learned what to say to <em>this</em> audience, the type of people on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, to get them to buy his act and buy his products.</p>

<p>Is there absolute proof Alex Jones is controlled opposition? No. But he probably is. His whole operation is coincidentally right next to Stratfor, he has had Stratfor employees work for him, and his whole operation was founded at the same time. There&#39;s the fact that Jones has a habit of showing up to scream, yell, rant and rave at peaceful protests, that he has a habit of co-opting movements, screaming and acting like a moron, before moving on to the next movement. Jones takes legitimate stories, then he starts crying about interdimensional beings, or Lucifer, or how much of a real man he is. That&#39;s all circumstantial, though. Is there a decent amount of evidence to suggest he is nothing but a snake oil salesman who lacks any real integrity? Absolutely. But again, circumstantial. </p>

<p>Returning to a previous point, the character of Alex Jones, the guy who believes there is an end times battle for our souls coming, would not back down because of a legal fight. So, either Alex Jones is full of crap and saw his money slipping away, <em>or</em> Alex Jones is controlled opposition. Either way, he is not the man he portrays on the TV. He is not the tough, fight to the death, warrior for Jesus and America that he says he is. He is a pussy afraid of a legal fight or he is a liar. </p>

<p>I watched his show every night until this &quot;pizzagate&quot; fiasco for the last several years. Central to Alex Jones&#39; ideology is the idea that there is a battle between God and Lucifer and the elites are in league with Lucifer and are attempting to destroy humanity. It delves into end times prophecy and the anti-Christ. Maybe I&#39;ve watched his show more than you have? If I cared to, I could find the clip of him crying about the Luciferian plot to destroy humanity. </p>

<p>What I think Alex Jones does is get on the air and sell vitamins and water filters to people who want to believe. They tell themselves they don&#39;t want to believe, that they&#39;d be better off not knowing, but then they wouldn&#39;t have the secret knowledge no-one else has and they wouldn&#39;t be able to guide people to that knowledge. I think Alex Jones preys on people by manipulating them and taking advantage of them. He is a performer who knows how to play his audience. </p>

<p>No, it was Alex Jones proving once and for all he is a bullshit artist who doesn&#39;t believe in anything other than making money. Again, if he really believed in this battle between evil and good, light and dark, then he would&#39;ve said screw it and  fought the legal battle and exposed the globalists and the elites. But he didn&#39;t. Because he doesn&#39;t care.</p>

<p>There were definitely strange things about the Zodiac case that echoed David Berkowitz&#39; son of Sam murders. Very occult overtones. One of his victims was a &quot;witch&quot; and involved (seemingly) in drug trafficking through the mail to a Mexican man who she married, promptly left and then received many mysterious packages from, all the while living far above her means.</p>

<p>The military watch found and the Navy boot prints are very interesting. </p>

<p>That whole case is all sorts of fucky. It could certainly be a &quot;programmed to kill&quot; situation.</p>

<p>I liked alot of the stuff you were saying in this post. I just checked out the whole thread. </p>

<p>I really think many serial killers provide important links to the deep states black ops.</p>

<p>Drug and occult sects are aspects of intelligence. If you find any interesting leads please tell!

    <div class="md"><p>I for one think the intelligence community needs to be much less secretive honestly. 
Have no black budgets and so on. It doesn&#39;t mean disclosing their R&amp;D stuff or equipment specifics. </p>

<p>They can still operate in secret against aggressors and monitor potential issues while being less like unseen &quot;big brother&quot; the problem is we are REALLY deep right now and as vault 7 showed they are and see themselves as power. </p>

<p>I fear the US may have to have its own spring honestly, and there&#39;s just too many people who are quite literally useless. 
The &quot;ban guns&quot; type of liberal. I am a liberal myself but the idea of &quot;ban guns will stop violence and be magic for everyone&quot; really just opens us up to instead of a quick death by psychopaths ya know being stabbed. </p>

<p>I can&#39;t stand Alex Jones, and trust me, I am not part of any organized group to attack Jones. I turned on Jones when he treated the Libertarians like shit on the steps of the Courthouse in Austin when the Ron Paul supporters were protesting the city&#39;s abuse of its citizens. He showed up un-announced, and they welcomed him and invited him to speak. He ignored them and started screaming at cars through his bull horn. When the Libertarians approached him he started screaming at them. He showed his true colors. </p>

<p>See, I think the lowest scum of the Earth are rapists and murderers. But having a conspiracy theory? I guess that&#39;s worse than rape and murder.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>and he was getting more upvotes than I was. On a conspiracy forum.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s my point. It&#39;s interesting to me how <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> seems to have a complete disdain for conspiracy theories all of the sudden.</p>

<p>On the subject of Sandy Hook, William Cooper wrote in <em>Behold a Pale Horse</em> about how toward the end they would begin to fake mass shootings that would progressively get worse and worse to garner more support for gun control. That being said, I&#39;m not sure how I feel about that. I&#39;m not willing to say, &quot;This is true,&quot; to most conspiracy theories, unless I can see declassified documents pertaining to the operation or well researched historical documentation. With something like Sandy Hook it&#39;s hard to get something like that. That&#39;s why there are conspiracies I can definitively speak about in all confidence, such as MKULTRA or Operation Paperclip, and then there are others that I just enjoy reading about but avoid having a definitive opinion on because there&#39;s just not enough evidence.</p>

<p>For me and probably many here, it was the &quot;JFK moment&quot; where we first were made aware of government conspiracies in our own time.

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>See, I was made a believer by reading about COINTELPRO, Operation Chaos, Operation Artichoke, Operation Midnight Climax, Air America, Iran-Contra, the Mena Connection, Gary Webb, stuff like that. I long entertained the idea of conspiracies and government plots growing up on Oliver Stone&#39;s JFK and The X-Files and Coast-to-Coast AM with Art Bell, but eventually put all of that aside. Later, I rediscovered &quot;conspiracies&quot; when I watched Anthony Russo&#39;s America: Freedom to Fascism. Then I went to college to get my undergraduates and began studying the CIA, history, political theory, discourse analysis, propaganda studies, memetics, and, as they say, became &quot;red pilled.&quot; </p>

<p>My dad was a combat medic in Vietnam and one of his good friends was a pilot that worked with this outfit and another called &quot;Southern Air Transport&quot; all the way into the &#39;80s. Talking with that man was the moment I realized more was happening that <em>wasn&#39;t</em> talked about than there was being shoveled us by mass media (pre-internet mind you). </p>

<p>America: Freedom to Fascism was what made me become more aware of the extent of the &quot;long game&quot; being played against all of us. It inspired me to do a lot of historical research to follow the money trails. Money trails lead crazy places if one follows them deep enough. ;)</p>

<p>Don&#39;t you think that if the people of Europe were as heavily armed as Americans, they wouldn&#39;t be too stressed about this refugee crisis? Don&#39;t you think that if ISIS knew anyone in London could be packing heat, they&#39;d be less likely to start stabbing random people, or driving cars into groups of people?</p>

<p>Also, consider that most of the mass shootings we&#39;ve had in the states have occurred in gun free zones, meaning those following the law didn&#39;t have guns, those breaking the law had guns. In Florida, if someone were to pull a gun at a theater, you&#39;d have at least a half dozen people with guns shooting back. This is why the Orlando shooting was seized upon by gay gun rights advocates as a way to push gun ownership for homosexuals and LGBTQ+ people, as a way for them to defend themselves.</p>

<p>I guarantee you, an ISIS sympathizer has to think long and hard as to where they want to attack in the US and in states like Florida and Texas that have open carry, stand your ground laws, and things like that. In London, in many parts of Europe, they don&#39;t have to think about armed citizens at all, for the most part.</p>

<p>My point is, guns are a deterrent. The United States is one of the most heavily armed countries in the world. This is why any invading force would not only face the impossible logistics of getting all their armor and troops here, but they would also have to deal with a heavily armed citizenry.</p>

<p>I think we should all have an anti-Guru, anti-talking head, anti-Demagogue agenda. Anyone within the power structure, any celebrity, any politician who comes along offering to save us, is a liar and a fraud.</p>

<p>&quot;At that time many will turn away from the faith and will betray and hate each other, and many false prophets will appear and deceive many people. Because of the increase of wickedness, the love of most will grow cold, but he who stands firm to the end will be saved. . . . For false Christs and false prophets will appear and perform great signs and miracles to deceive even the elect – if that were possible. See, I have told you ahead of time&quot; - Matthew, 24</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Im one of those people....is it so mysterious when conspiracy is in the front of the news these days????..I came here to read the absurd accusations that Russia couldnt be involved, and its all a left wing consperacy to start ww3!,When the facts and history of Russian cyber propaganda is well known and anaylized(russia spent $200million few years ago) absurby easy to accsess and google decades of analysis from russian intelligence think tanks, republican and democrat and non partison think tanks. (pre trump even! Duh) , non partison, normal information easily avialiable to anyone.......now the right wing is thinking being antiRussian is antiAmerican!!!!  And no one on the left is demonizing Russia into satanic babyrapers like the republicans are doing to thier own federal employees! This is  business as usual..both usa and russia interfere....
The history  of russian agression is easy to understand. Russia has nukes, they want territory, Us and Nato are in the way.
Does it mean russia is evil? No, they are doing whatever is in their self interest, interfering with elections is NORMAL BUSINESS in europe and third world.</p>

<p>I am here to see the results of russian propaganda, hiw it demonizes us liberal &quot; globaliists&quot; into cartoony evil....but so sad and third worldish.....just what Russia wants!!</p>

<p>Donald Trump is the government.</p>

<p>The Executive Branch is not the government. There are three branches of government. The Executive is one of them. The President&#39;s power and authority in the Constitution is very limited, most of the powers the President has now have been adopted over time by Presidents expanding the scope of the Executive.</p>

<p>In truth, <em>we</em> the people are the real government of the United States. Unfortunately, our voices have been silenced. All we can do is bitch and fight on social media or protest in the streets and get sprayed with hoses. In the halls of government, the true ruling power today is money.</p>

If something good happens then Trump gets the credit but if something bad happens then Trump is just one man powerless to the wants and whims of the real powers at work.</p>

<p>Positive job reports under obama were declared fake by Trump.  A positive job report under Trump that was a result still of the Obama administration was suddenly declared real by Trump and he wants credit for it even though the numbers were from before he even took office.  It&#39;s the same game it always was.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry OP, there is a problem with this sub but you&#39;re on the wrong side of it.</p>

<p>There was a time when conspiracies were about looking at photos, evidence, inconsistencies and trying to put a theory to them that explains them. Maybe I&#39;m just remembering the usenet days.</p>

<p>Modern conspiracies, and the majority of users on the sub are guilty of peddling them, are more like FanFictions than conspiracies.</p>

<p>Like Flat Earth, there is no basis to discuss Pizzagate properly. There is no evidence. There are people sharing a collective Fanfiction and shouting down those that argue back with accusations of shill and shariablu. You can&#39;t build a sub or a community on that.</p>

<p>For as long as that remains the case, r/conspiracy is going to be a mess of a sub.</p>

<p>There are probably lots of reasons why this has happened, and I imagine the main reason is the influx of politicized alt-right people from The_Donald arriving looking to push political agendas rather than with a genuine interest in conspiracies.</p>

<p>We need to move away from posts like &quot;Here&#39;s my pizzagate wiki&quot;, anyone who disagrees with me is a shill&quot; and move into &quot;here&#39;s a document from the FBI dated X, what do people think?&quot;</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think that&#39;ll happen at this point but this sub is going to continue getting more cancerous and further from finding any truth in anything until something changes.</p>

<p>But there is plenty of evidence to suggest those within the political power structure are involved with such activities. People just do not want to look at that evidence because they refuse to believe it. For example, the Left and Trump haters will quickly point to Trump&#39;s relationship with Epstein and the accusations they both raped a 13 year old.

<p>I would flip this argument around. During the campaign, people were claiming Bill Clinton was a rapist long before Trump was accused of anything. Trump&#39;s accusations against him didn&#39;t even really start until right before the campaign ended. </p>

<p>Once the accusations against Trump came out, the same people autistically screeching while holding up &quot;Bill Clinton is a rapist&quot; signs at all those rallies would then turn around and deny any possibility that Trump committed any sexual assaults</p>

I think the PG thing has an anti-Hillary feel that makes  alot of people thinking PG is a Alt Right fake news something something. If we start looking at the possibility of a group that intentionally finds places of power/trust for their crime against children such as the Boys Town scandal of the 80s or Speaker of the House Hastert or even Gilles de Rais then we might actually do some damage to these fuckers instead of getting pulled into a left vs right argument. </p>

<p>But that is just my take on it. </p>

<p>And while I&#39;m on my soap box, we as a community should look at a way to fund a private investigator the next time there is a major lead. I think that after the PG info was first released a PI could have easily done a little surveillance outside of Comet and found hard evidence. </p>

<p>Exactly this. I&#39;m not really sure what happened.

<p>First off, Podesta was best friends and traveling companions with Hastert.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Trump flew on Lolita Express too.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And I&#39;ve mentioned on this thread, though not in the initial post, this relationship between Trump and Epstein. In fact, <a href="http://www.bluedotdaily.com/sworn-testimony-from-trump-rape-case-finally-released">here</a> are excerpts from the victims testimony. Here are some quotes from that...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>‘Defendant Trump initiated sexual contact with Plaintiff at four different parties. On the fourth and final sexual encounter with Defendant Trump, Defendant Trump tied Plaintiff to a bed, exposed himself to Plaintiff, and then proceeded to forcibly rape Plaintiff. During the course of this savage sexual attack, Plaintiff loudly pleaded with Defendant Trump to stop but with no effect. Defendant Trump responded to Plaintiff’s pleas by violently striking Plaintiff in the face with his open hand and screaming that he would do whatever he wanted.’</p>

<p>‘Defendant Epstein had sexual contact with Plaintiff at two of the parties. The second sexual encounter with Defendant Epstein took place after Plaintiff had been raped by Defendant Trump. Defendant Epstein forced himself upon Plaintiff and proceeded to rape her anally and vaginally despite her loud pleas to stop. Defendant Epstein then attempted to strike Plaintiff about the head with his closed fists while he angrily screamed at Plaintiff that he, Defendant Epstein, rather than Defendant Trump, should have been the one who took Plaintiff’s virginity, before Plaintiff finally managed to break away from Defendant Epstein.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Happy?</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t think you could recognize what is obvious. I think that you have emotions and beliefs and clearly those trump (no pun intended) logic and reason. Rather than take the time to understand what <em>I</em> was saying, you immediately jumped into defense mode. Why? Because you have a worldview, a reality that you have vested time and energy in maintaining, and when information threatens that reality you become hyper emotional and do whatever you can to maintain cognitive consistency. So, you ignore what I <em>actually</em> said for what you <em>think</em> I said as a way of deflecting and ignoring information.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, he didn&#39;t say Trump flew around with Epstein. So, that negates everything else he said! Aha! He must be a Trump supporter! I totally got this guy!&quot;</p>

<p>Since you&#39;re willing to entertain this seemingly far fetched notion, let&#39;s speculate, shall we?</p>

<p>John Podesta sat on the board of Joule Unlimited, a Massachusetts energy company whose controlling entity, Joule Global Stichting, was a client of Mossack Fonseca of the &quot;Panama Papers&quot; scandal. The Russian company Rusnano, which was created by Vladimir Putin in 2007, invested billions of rubles in Joule Unlimited, a sum totalling around $35 million dollars. On the board of Rusnano with John Podesta was Putin&#39;s friend and oligarch Ruben Vardanyan. Obama announced in 2009 a &quot;bilateral Presidential Commission&quot; between Russia and the United States to identify, &quot;areas of cooperation and pursuing joint projects and actions that strengthen strategic stability, international stability, economic well-being and the development of ties between the Russian and American people.” Hillary Clinton managed to get Google, Cisco, Intel, and others to “help” with the Skolkovo Foundation project. In 2014, the FBI told the Obama administration, “The Skolkovo Foundation may be a means for the Russian government to access our nation’s sensitive or classified research development facilities and dual-use technologies with commercial and military application.” Twenty-eight U.S., European, and Russian companies took part in the Skolkovo Foundation project, seventeen of them donated to the Clinton Foundation, or paid Bill Clinton to give speeches. One of the companies that donated to the Clintons? Joule Unlimited. In fact, Bill Clinton was paid by Renaissance Capital, a Russian investment bank, $500,000 for a speech that promoted Uranium One stock right before the Russian company ROSATOM purchased Uranium One. Immediately after the purchase $145 million from Uranium One shareholders was donated to the Clinton Foundation.</p>

<p>So, my question to you is why aren&#39;t we also investigating the Democrats? If it&#39;s clear both sides have colluded against American interests for their own personal gain, why aren&#39;t we holding everyone accountable? Why isn&#39;t this a bipartisan issue?</p>

<p>What it looks like to <em>me</em> is that there has been a concerted effort for many years to compromise both the Democrats and the Republicans and destabilize the American political system by fomenting dissent and doubt in the legitimacy of the government, effectively bogging down the Trump administration and thereby slowing down the US government. Which means the strategy, if Trump were in on it, is entirely self-defeating and makes very little sense. Everything he does is under a microscope. What does he get out of this? Financial reward means nothing if you are in prison, or your head is on a spike. So who actually benefits from all of this? Certainly not Donald Trump. No, something more is going on here and I think it&#39;s exactly what <a href="https://youtu.be/5gnpCqsXE8g">Yuri Bezmenov</a> said would happen. </p>

<p>But how do <em>you</em> know this? How do you know who really controls what? You and I only know what we are being shown. Our view of the world beyond our immediate perception is manufactured for us. Both parties serve the same interests, they use rhetoric to make themselves look different, but the reality is they both serve the same corporate owners.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Again, how do you know she isn&#39;t a power broker? How do you know <em>any</em> of this? How do you know where the real center of power lies? If the people setting the agenda are where the real power lies, then it doesn&#39;t matter who is President, who is elected, because the people in charge are just puppets.</p>

<p>Consider for a moment who Donald Trump&#39;s policies benefit. If my goal were to weaken the United States and pull it back from the world scene so the vacuum could be filled with another world power, Donald Trump&#39;s policies are exactly what I want. And if I want to demonstrate the failures of statism and nationalism, to highlight the importance of why globalist institutions matter, what better way to do that than to give us a guy who tears all of that down and shows us what the world is like without it? People seem to think Donald Trump is a problem for the globalists. I argue he&#39;s just what they want.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Seems like, but isn&#39;t. Because before &quot;Pizzagate&quot; became about Comet Ping Pong and sex dungeons, it was actually just about elite pedophiles. You know, like Epstein and Clinton and possibly Trump. I posit that &quot;Pizzagate&quot; was legitimate, and when people realized where the dots connected, they quickly did their best job of discrediting the whole thing. But the cat is out of the bag, and now it&#39;s just part of the chaos, part of the noise, a story that is laughed at and mocked but will never go away.</p>

<p>The globalists want a one world government, they do not want it lead by the United States or direct democracy. They want a system of government where elite world managers decide what is best for the people. The way to do that is to lay out all the failures of democracy and capitalism, to demoralize Americans and the West to their way of life, to get them to not trust their government, the media, or anything. Trump, the rise of the right, the push for nationalism and sovereignty, the collapse of the EU, Brexit, the refugee crisis, all of this is about weakening everything built since WW2 by the West so that when some economic panic or global war or some combination thereof facilitates the collapse of Western institutions, the solution can be provided in the form of a more powerful United Nations, a more powerful global government system that can address all the problems that created the economic panic and the global war. Because things will be so bad, people won&#39;t see that the solution to the problem is being offered up by the same people who created the problem in the first place.</p>

<p>Now look at what Trump has been doing, look at how the Left has reacted to him. They want to kill their own President because of allegations spread by the media. They&#39;ve not seen one stick of evidence, just words. And they want their President to die. </p>

<p>This plan is working and it will continue to work. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Another threat, less overt but no less basic, confronts liberal democracy. More directly linked to the impact of technology, it involves the gradual appearance of a more controlled and directed society. Such a society would be dominated by an elite whose claim to political power would rest on allegedly superior scientific know how. Unhindered by the restraints of traditional liberal values, this elite would not hesitate to achieve its political ends by using the latest modern techniques for influencing public behavior and keeping society under close surveillance and control. Under such circumstances, the scientific and technological momentum of the country would not be reversed but would actually feed on the situation it exploits.</p>

<p>Persisting social crisis, the emergence of a charismatic personality, and the exploitation of mass media to obtain public confidence would be the stepping stones in the piecemeal transformation of the United States into a highly controlled society.&quot;
- Zbigniew Brzeziński</p>

<p>This has happened already and is growing progressively worse. Once Americans are fully demoralized by their oppressive government that they&#39;ve grown increasingly intolerant of, once the economy tanks, once global war disrupts our lives, once everything we know is turned upside down, the people will beg to be saved from their corrupt leaders in Washington DC by their global government. But two things are key before that can happen, we need a big war to destroy the world so we can put it back together again and strengthen the UN, and we need major civil unrest in the United States.</p>
