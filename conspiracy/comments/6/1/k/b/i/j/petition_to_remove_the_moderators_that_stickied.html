    <div class="md"><p>This whole sub is a pro-Trump propaganda platform. There are still daily anti-Clinton and anti-Obama articles on the front page daily. Meanwhile there is an actual conspiracy unfolding involving the Trump campaign that, judging by the front page, this sub has never even heard of. It wouldn&#39;t surprise me if Steve Bannon was pulling the strings. And don&#39;t forget that even Devin Nunes acknowledged on Monday that &quot;online trolls spreading anti-American conspiracy theories&quot; is one of the elements of Russia&#39;s disinformation campaign they waged against the US.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My favorite part is there&#39;s literally a pro Putin article on the front page at this very moment. It&#39;s an old article someone dragged up from like 2012, about Putin blocking US adoption of Russian children. </p>

<p>One-two punch: make Putin look good, and push the pizzagate narrative. Just like literally every front-page post is pushing the pizzagate narrative. I thought conspiracy theorists were supposed to be good at pattern recognition. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Have you ever stopped to think for a moment, that maybe <em>you&#39;ve</em> been psy-op&#39;d? Not everyone is omniscient in their discernment, but in the open world of free speech, free thought, discussion, debate, sharing and challenging of ideas, etc. there is plenty of room for all aspects and potentials to be considered openly. Let&#39;s just say that what you&#39;re seeing is the Meta, and I doubt -highly doubt- that shills or bots from T_D or pro-Trump groups are astroturfing - while on the other hand we have plenty of proof and evidence of that nefarious behavior from the far-Left in establishment politics. This isn&#39;t really about a Right-Left polar battle - that is just a distraction anyway.. If you <em>actually took the time to understand</em> the history, philosophy, ideology, the agenda in the bigger picture, you would see characters like Obama, Clinton, Bush, and others have served interests that were/are not good for Americans and in recent context has intended subeversion upon the traditional principle and structure of the USA. Demonize Nationalism and glorify Globalism. There is a lot more going on than meets the eye, and if all you&#39;re thinking about is Russians &amp; hackers subverting our Nation and sovereignty, IMO you&#39;re being played by the distraction and it&#39;s honestly one of the older tricks in the book.</p>

<p>yes &amp; no..the term has ambiguity.  Yes, to a certain extent. That people with power, influence, money or access, are serving the interests of pedophilia? That kind of abuse is going on across the world and child sex trafficking is definitely a real thing.. why would the US political elite class be immune to such depravity..</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Do you believe Russia interfered with the 2016 US presidential election?
also ambiguous.. I&#39;d try explaining my perspective on that but the question&#39;s loaded; totally open to interpretation. How is it being implied, to what extent, what are the facts, etc. <em>You see: There&#39;s *</em>always** stuff going on* in the cyber-world, interferences are business as usual. To single Russia out is silly. To imply they could clandestinely control the election of our president? To imply that their campaign was what swayed millions of Americans in their choice to vote for Trump? Silly. &amp; No I don&#39;t think he&#39;s a Russian spy, working as a plant for Putin or something.. </p>

<p>Do you believe Hillary Clinton should be in jail?
Personally I don&#39;t have any place to make a serious judgement like that. I think that she should be held accountable for her actions, and I think she&#39;s been given a pass more than once. Because if you&#39;re speaking about technicality, there are lesser crimes that have been committed where the defendent got jail time. There are also greater crimes that the system has turned a blind eye to, in the end every individual, every incidence should be looked at without personal bias and even the most heinous acts should be judged fairly and treated with impartial decorum.</p>

<p>Do you believe Donald Trump or members of his administration have illegal ties to Russian interests?
Illegal? Not to Donald Trump&#39;s knowledge. Obviously if anyone <em>outside</em> of Trump&#39;s admin had illegal ties it would be a big issue right? What about illegal ties to any other country regardless of our relationship to them, illegal is illegal.. And hey, Maybe there&#39;s a traitor out there, maybe it&#39;s someone new or maybe they&#39;ve been on the scene for a long time. Could be unrelated to Trump&#39;s initial campaign and sequential win for POTUS. In the end I don&#39;t think Trump has personally known everyone in his administration, and who else aside from that individual should be scrutinized? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because all governments do that or attempt to. If they do it by informing the citizenry of a democracy of their leaders corruption, I see no issue. The establisment is corrupt, left and right. Perhaps even trump but judging by the amount they hate him that is unlikely. This doesn&#39;t look like calculated opposition. It looks like the convulsions of a fish out of water with incoherent animal fear of death/destruction.</p>

If only the mods that sticked that topic had come out and admitted it right in that topic then we would know which ones to deport. ShariaBlue must have something to do with this! Such a spicy petition, out out out with all the cucks!

<p>Don&#39;t you know how social media works? It&#39;s pretty simple statistics.. &amp; I don&#39;t think that this subreddit showcases carefully selected submissions. </p>

<p>Look, if you just leave it up to the general traffic to vote up/down you are not going to get the best of the best always at the top. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Do you believe in pizzagate?  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>yes &amp; no..the term has ambiguity.  Yes, to a certain extent. That people with power, influence, money or access, are serving the interests of pedophilia? That kind of abuse is going on across the world and child sex trafficking is definitely a real thing.. why would the US political elite class be immune to such depravity..</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Do you believe Russia interfered with the 2016 US presidential election?
also ambiguous.. I&#39;d try explaining my perspective on that but the question&#39;s loaded; totally open to interpretation. How is it being implied, to what extent, what are the facts, etc. <em>You see: There&#39;s *</em>always** stuff going on* in the cyber-world, interferences are business as usual. To single Russia out is silly. To imply they could clandestinely control the election of our president? To imply that their campaign was what swayed millions of Americans in their choice to vote for Trump? Silly. &amp; No I don&#39;t think he&#39;s a Russian spy, working as a plant for Putin or something.. </p>

<p>Do you believe Hillary Clinton should be in jail?
Personally I don&#39;t have any place to make a serious judgement like that. I think that she should be held accountable for her actions, and I think she&#39;s been given a pass more than once. Because if you&#39;re speaking about technicality, there are lesser crimes that have been committed where the defendent got jail time. There are also greater crimes that the system has turned a blind eye to, in the end every individual, every incidence should be looked at without personal bias and even the most heinous acts should be judged fairly and treated with impartial decorum.</p>

<p>Do you believe Donald Trump or members of his administration have illegal ties to Russian interests?
Illegal? Not to Donald Trump&#39;s knowledge. Obviously if anyone <em>outside</em> of Trump&#39;s admin had illegal ties it would be a big issue right? What about illegal ties to any other country regardless of our relationship to them, illegal is illegal.. And hey, Maybe there&#39;s a traitor out there, maybe it&#39;s someone new or maybe they&#39;ve been on the scene for a long time. Could be unrelated to Trump&#39;s initial campaign and sequential win for POTUS. In the end I don&#39;t think Trump has personally known everyone in his administration, and who else aside from that individual should be scrutinized? </p>

<p>I believe it&#39;s possible politicians are involved with human trafficking and pedophilia. I also believe it&#39;s possible that politicians would not participate in those activities. </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>I believe it&#39;s possible Russia helped elect Trump into office.  I also believe it&#39;s possible the CIA has the ability to create digital evidence to appear Russia interfered. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Do you believe Hillary Clinton should be in jail?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I believe classified information in her control was viewed by unauthorized personnel. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>I believe it is possible.</p>

<p>That solved nothing because you&#39;re still upset that this is a place taken over by trump shills. Guess what dummy, there are shills everywhere.</p>
