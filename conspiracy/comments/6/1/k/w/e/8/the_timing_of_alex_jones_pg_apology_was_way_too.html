        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The timing of his &quot;apology&quot; is what gave it away for me, that this was premeditated...</p>

<p>The leading alternative media figure comes out and says Pizzagate is fake, the DAY BEFORE the big protest? That was done by design...</p>

<p>Now, everyone can share his apology video with the headline that says, </p>

<p>&quot;Alex Jones apologizes for spreading fake news Pizzagate story&quot;, and the shills have TONS OF AMMO against us now. It was all just this cleverly designed psy op to damage our investigation as much as possible, using Alex Jones by association. </p>

<p>Whether it was a lawsuit that forced him to backdown, or he was complicit in this, I&#39;m not sure. However, I&#39;m really starting to lean toward the side of him being a &quot;plant&quot;.</p>

<p>I think AJ was planted years ago, said some truths in the early days to gain some respect, but he was always going to be used as the &quot;insider&quot; among the patriot movement. Kind of like Matt Damon in the movie &quot;The Departed&quot;. He&#39;s high up cop, but he&#39;s collecting info and leading them down wrong rabbit holes so his crimes buddies always get away scott free. </p>

<p>At this point, any rational conspiracy theorist should have extreme reservations regarding both Donald Trump AND Alex Jones. They don&#39;t represent this sub at all, that needs to be known. I&#39;ve been saying for a long time that we are only going to get in trouble by being associated with them, they are phonies. </p>

<p>the crucial piece of information that you&#39;re missing, that would have helped you figure this out yourself, is this; Alex Jones doesn&#39;t believe any of the shit he peddles, and he considers those who do idiots useful only for buying the worthless quack medicine his show is a vehicle for.  He is not a crusader, he has most certainly not found the truth and even he doesn&#39;t believe the stories he repeats.  With that assumed all his actions make much more sense, i think you&#39;ll find anyhow. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been saying Jones was a plant since he endorsed Trump..I was a follower of AJ for a long time. As soon as he endorsed trump, I knew something was up...</p>

<p>He had always dissed the two party system. He&#39;s the guy that showed me the two party system was just this elaborate ruse to divide the people. Then, he fully endorsed republican values, and just turns into this ridiculously outlandish and hyped up WWE star type guy...He is supposed to have a responsibility being the face of alternative media, and he handles it in a very immature way. </p>

<p>That&#39;s a delicate position, you&#39;re going to be under the fucking microscope if you&#39;re the alternative media figure. And he always portrays himself as so wacky and insane and outlandish. Any true patriot would know, if you&#39;re talking about information that people would consider to be &quot;crazy&quot;, like many conspiracies are, you want to appear as rational as possible. I think he does this intentionally, yes, to make us look ridiculous. Is he a plant? Potentially yea. </p>

I believe James alifantis is involved in this and that Comet Ping Pong Pizza is involved in some suspect activities. But Alex Jones did not apologize to anyone else other than him. As a matter of fact, Alex Jones said on the Joe Rogan podcast that the James alifantis and Comet Ping Pong Pizza parts of pizza gate or part of a psyop to take the heat off of the real criminals which is the Clinton foundation and the rest of the world leaders who are buying and selling these children. It is not about Comet Ping Pong Pizza Nor is it about James alifantis. It never was. It&#39;s about the global Elite.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because it anyone who is using his statement on Friday to discredit him is doing the exact same thing that the mainstream media does. The tactics are identical. I watch that entire video before I heard anyone else&#39;s opinion on it and the only conclusion that I came to was he was separating himself only from James alifantis and Comet Ping Pong Pizza. But, everyone on this thread is doing the same thing the mainstream media does. Manipulating the meeting behind it to fit their own narrative. It in this case your narrative is Alex Jones is misinformation.</p>

Backing out of Pizzagate like that is one thing, but endorsing Trump on top of It...it&#39;s just all so obvious that he&#39;s compliant with the powers that be. It&#39;s unfortunate but, what are ya gonna do? </p>

There are so many times he got caught shilling if this is the first time you became aware of the fact then, what&#39;s the point of even calling him out he will just find more people to dupe. He was being called out since before 911. If he was just some chump he would have just gone away. He is apart of the psyop, most likely protected and nobody else is allowed to eclipse him.</p>
