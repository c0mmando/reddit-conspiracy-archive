       A year ago my random blood sugar(glucose) reading was 637 mg, yes 637 mg (normal levels are around 140 mg)or 35.35 mmol/l !!!.
      </p>
      <p>
       Symptoms: Acute thirst, fruity smell in the breath and frequent urination along with dramatic weight-loss
      </p>
      <p>
       Presently: Fasting blood glucose is consistently around 100 mg and after meals(2 hrs) is around 150 mg  which are within the normal range,God-willing, gained weight , no longer  feel thirsty and rounds to the washroom are normal like before.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        How did I do it
       </strong>
       :
      </p>
      <p>
       I was determined to reverse my condition without medicines and God willing did it by eating a special diet
      </p>
      <p>
       First, let me inform you that a
       <a href="https://now.uiowa.edu/2015/06/bacteria-may-cause-type-2-diabetes">
        new research
       </a>
       ,
       <a href="http://www.naturalhealth365.com/gut-bacteria-type-2-diabetes-1694.html">
        Gut bacteria linked to the development of type 2 diabetes
       </a>
       says type 2 diabetes is caused by gut bacterial imbalance. In plain English, some bacteria in the human gut when they colonize in large numbers than normal,release toxins, these toxins spread in the blood stream and react with fat cells, resulting in system inflammation and a immune response which causes insulin resistance and leads to diabetes. May be that's the reason why after weight loss gastric bypass surgeries most people reverse their diabetes within hours, they just remove a large part of intestines in those surgeries or in effect remove part of the intestines which have colonies of bacteria which corrects the bacterial imbalance and normalizes sugar levels,
      </p>
      <p>
       The good news is this gut bacteria imbalance can be corrected by eating a specific diet, yes a diet as none of the antibacterial drugs or even taking probiotic works. One of the type of bacteria is staph (MRSA) is resistant to antibiotics, but this bacteria is easily killed by a chemical found in cruciferous cooked vegetables like broccoli, cauliflower and cabbage. Also cooked cruciferous vegetables are a fodder of good gut bacteria, it helps to repopulate your gut with good bacteria.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://europe.newsweek.com/staph-bacteria-may-be-trigger-type-2-diabetes-328211?rm=eu">
        For the study, published in the journal mBio, a team of microbiologists at the University of Iowa Carver College of Medicine exposed rabbits to the toxin produced by Staphylococcus aureus bacteria. The researchers found that exposure to high levels of this toxin caused the animals to develop symptoms of the disease, including insulin resistance, glucose intolerance and inflammation.

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2728691/">
        Human Gut Bacterial Communities Are Altered by Addition of Cruciferous Vegetables
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Follow the below diet for a month and you'll see the difference in the readings yourself
       </strong>
       :
      </p>
      <p>
       1.Eat very well cooked cruciferous vegetables like broccoli, cauliflower and cabbage( in the same preferred order), atleast half a pound(
       <del>
        500g
       </del>
       227g aprox) in a day, don't eat raw, only cooked.
      </p>
      <p>
       2.Avoid drinking chlorinated water, most tap water is treated with chlorine compounds during filtration at treatment plants, chlorine is a powerful killer of gut bacteria.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can use tap water after storing the water for atleast 24 hrs, as chorine in the water decomposes  within a day.
      </p>
      <p>
       3.Stop eating white flour products like bread, cookies, pizza, burgers etc. White flour is treated with a chemical called alloxan, which is a bleaching agent and bad for pancreas. Alloxan is also used in laboratory by scientist to induce diabetes in mice for research.
       <a href="http://thedailyhealth.co.uk/alloxan-diet-nutrition-diabetes-cancer-environmental-toxins/">
        Alloxan: Chemical In White Bread Induces Diabetes
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       4.Avoid anti-biotics as much as possible as they kill good bacteria in the gut.
      </p>
      <p>
       5.Take a tablet/capsule of B-complex vitamin, its good for cultivating friendly gut bacteria.
      </p>
      <p>
       6.Avoid fried foods, they are bad for good gut bacteria.
      </p>
      <p>
       7.Keep taking your regular medicines for diabetes and eat your normal food (carbs, vegetables, meat, fish etc)along with the above diet, but make sure you limit sweets, rice, sugary beverages/ soda drinks. sweet fruits and starchy vegetables. Once your blood glucose levels are down, stick to the diet although not strictly.
      </p>
      <p>
       Any questions welcomed.

      </p>
      <p>
       the great news is that it doesn't only cure diabetes,  but all disease related to toxemia.
      </p>
      <p>
       on top of that it also cheap and tasty.   pm me for further reading.

       The new part in this diet is that the sugar levels stay normal, even after you return to high carb diet, unlike low carb diet regimes, where sugar levels go high as soon as you quit dieting.

       I cross posted this to R/Diabetes.  Sounds quite interesting.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes low carb is also very effective.  This is doing something different though in attempting to reformulate the gut biotia.   I find diet and excercise is more effective at control than the prescribed meds I take.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'll give this a go can't hurt to try and not too different from what I do now except the massive cooked Brocolli part; I test lots so will be able to assess if it works.  I agree that there is something up with the Diabetes Epidemic + other Autoimmune disorders and that Medical Science has not come up with very good answers so far.

       That sub is teaming with shills of Big Pharma, so expect anyone posting holistic treatments, alternate therapies to be shunted out and their claims made fun of.
      </p>
      <p>
       Low carb diet works because I guess the diet ensures you are not feeding the bad bacteria in the gut with their favourite foods which helps them colonize in greater numbers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Balancing the gut flora helps balance the blood sugar levels, unfortunately not much medical research is going on in this field, the fact of the matter is there's billions of dollars profit  controlling diseases with medicines rather than curing them.

       Actually, that sub is teeming with diabetics who happen to treat the condition like their lives depend on it and don't take kindly to bullshit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most of the type 2 diabetics there like big pharma just as much as you but they dislike false claims of cures more.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do yourself a favour and lurk there for a while and you might find you can reduce your blood glucose levels below harmful 150 (definitely
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       normal) at two hours naturally without adding more meds and insulin but also without all the rules you just listed.
      </p>
      <p>
       But change the attitude if you decide to drop in.

       You have improved but you are certainly not cured. You are also not terribly well controlled. Let us know when your
       <strong>
        peak
       </strong>
       post-meal levels are closer to 126.

       Until then stop making such outrageous claims. "Cure" is a four-letter word for many of us until a true cure is found.

       Congratulations on finding a way towards better blood glucose management for

       I'll add a few extra points:

        1.Eat very well cooked cruciferous vegetables like broccoli, cauliflower and cabbage( in the same preferred order), atleast half a pound(500g227g aprox) in a day, don't eat raw, only cooked.
       </p>

      <p>
       I enjoy cabbage and similar but if I ate that much daily my wife would banish me from the house for the sulfurous results.
      </p>

      <p>
       I have drunk chlorinated and fluoridated water for over fifty years, including the fifteen since I was diagnosed with type 2. It has had no signifcant effect on my blood glucose management.

       It is not the chemicals which are the problem, it is simply the high carb content of the foods you list. I limit them,

       I eat plenty of meat for good B levels. However, those on metformin should investigate whether supplementation is needed to correct B12 depletion.

       Nonsense. Fats in moderation are an essential part of a good diet and do not significantly affect blood glucose control unless eaten together with excessive carbs.

       I'm sorry, please link me to where a gastric bypass involves removing segments of your intestines. My father had this surgery and I'm pretty familiar with how it works. Please do your research. The "several types" are different methods of connecting the newly made stomach to the intestines.

       This is nothing new lol most health professionals would recommend these changes in addition to their prescribed medications to see more success. Even as a personal trainer with only an education in sports nutrition, this is pretty common knowledge in the industry.

       Yeah, using food as a medical treatment is as old as the hills.  The amazing thing is that for our costliest chronic diseases (diabetes, heart disease, etc) food is much more powerful than even our best drugs.
