<p>Even if he legit went crazy, which I don&#39;t believe the evidence supports, there was still a blatant attempt made to ensure history was written in a specific way.  It is better if such things fail.</p>

If this is indeed what he said, I&#39;d say this is an example of someone who is smart but not smart enough to actually understand the complex (scientific) ideas/theories. He may have been saying up for awhile and not sleep at all during the night, possibly reading, woriking, and one thing led to another he went a tad bit psychotic.

    <div class="md"><p>All of what Ive said is scientific; people who cannot understant theories of relativity and quantum physics but know their significance tend to lose hold of reality as a result of misunderstooding complex ideas, like the idea/theory that we live in a simulated reality/the matrix. Someone who is bipolar 1 generally lives in a manic state, they tend to obsess over ideas/thoughts that are difficult to grasp, they wind up staying awake for days because there is no need for sleep when youre living on cloud 9. Imagine the greatest cocaine binge you could go on without having to even do any drugs. Feels great until things get out of hand and that line between genius and crazy becomes dashed with an increasingly longer spacing between each segment. So which assumption was wrong and not scientific because as far as I know Kayne West has absolutely no physics/quantum physics background, and it seems like you may not no much about psychology and bipolar.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Kanye is a very complicated figure. It&#39;s very obvious that he has battled issues with his mental health on and off, he&#39;s usually the first to admit that. It&#39;s right there in a lot of his music. His self awareness is a big part of his appeal (along with being a fantastic producer), vulnerability coupled with bravado.</p>

<p>That said, the media and society at large like to equate these issues with total madness, as opposed to the types of struggles that many of us also face. Any time Kanye says anything, it can be easily written off as &quot;Oh he&#39;s just crazy&quot;, even if it&#39;s something that carries a lot of truth like the George Bush/Katrina comments. The contents of his music and his social media personality make it too easy to dismiss stuff like this, which is a shame.</p>

<p>Kanye was tossed in the psych ward by Kim and Kris. He is under KM ultra mind control most likely and went in for a tune up. Or they cloned him and that&#39;s not the real Kanye at all. </p>

I don&#39;t know man, I believe most stuff that gets posted here but this is the kind of stuff that just kept me up at night when I was 19.

<p>His immaturity, power, money, and that wife of his....yea, I think he just had a legitimate breakdown based on paranoid delusions.  He&#39;s in a glass house, everybody is his yes man.   That kind of circumstance of life....seems like his breakdown was a result of that life.  </p>

<p>I like his music ok though.  I don&#39;t think me and him would get along just kicking it Though.  Seems like a selfish asshole that doesn&#39;t understand common logic.  I wish him the best though.  </p>

<p>Even if he just pointed out something that you personally feel is &quot;common sense&quot;, that doesn&#39;t mean everyone is aware. </p>

<p>Almost everything Kanye does is big news so if he says something like this then he is putting it in the eyes of possibly millions of people who wouldn&#39;t have known or thought about it otherwise. </p>

<p>It&#39;s easy to trivialize and judge someone from your perspective but I don&#39;t really see what you gain from wasting your time and energy being negative about people you will never meet.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Somthing to consider. The programing is thick, deep, subconcious and taped intro individuals feeling of well being safety. Socialy  physicaly and spiritually. They cling to thier personal truths and anytjing that is not in line with thar is direct threat.</p>

<p>I can renember a point were i didnt want to &quot;wake up&quot;. Its scared me deeply i began questioning EVERYTHING. and even still day to day im tempted to shut mouth put my head down and stay in line. </p>

<p>But when it comes to helping others see the truth what ever that may be. It helps to appproch people with compasion creativity understanding (that they may not be ready) and love.</p>

<p>Becuase ultimatly we need the masses woke. We all need to take a personal responsibility for the mess we are in. </p>

Payola is what he&#39;s talking about and it&#39;s nothing new. For years, artists, record labels, producers...they&#39;ve paid radio stations to keep the same songs in rotation. What&#39;s funny to me are the people in this sub lamenting him as some kind of prophet or hardcore truth speaker for telling us what we already knew. Then sits there and says &#39;fuck looking cool, fuck being cool&#39; and has yet to take a look at the own publicity stunts he&#39;s pulled for attention. Leather Sweat Suit anyone?
Yeah, he&#39;s keeping it real alright, REAL DUMB! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Really though, he didn&#39;t want to give up creative control. His show is so fondly remembered because we saw it exactly as he intended. The network wanted to cut the black white supremacist sketch down to 5 minutes (take note of how long Key and Peele sketches are), which would have ruined it. Once someone gives you $50 million, they own you, and he didn&#39;t want to deal with that. </p>

<p>Then he comes back out of nowhere and signs a $60 million deal with Netflix. Fuckin A, man, that&#39;s awesome. I love Dave Chappelle, the guy is on his way towards being an American treasure. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You guys need to dig deeper on Chapelle&#39;s situation. He didn&#39;t just give up 50 million and then take a vacation, he up and left the country and the production WITHOUT TELLING HIS WIFE AND KIDS.</p>

<p>Now either Chapelle has a bit of mental illness like all the greats, or he snapped because people were really out to get him, but you don&#39;t just leave your wife and kids without even a phone call until you&#39;ve already landed in another country across the world unless you are losing your mind. </p>

<p>What is interesting, is Chapelle has altered his comedy, I&#39;ve seen him a few times, and I just saw his two new (old) specials. He&#39;s not referencing the powers that be anymore, he&#39;s not pulling back the curtain, he&#39;s just doing the funny stuff while ignoring the kind of George Carlin deep thinking and truth he was mixing in a lot of before. </p>

<p>He played nice and miraculously he signs a 60 million dollar deal to replace the 50 million he lost. It&#39;s also interesting that Dave has basically referenced that he had 10 million already multiple times, and why did another 50 matter to compromise his beliefs? His lifestyle wouldn&#39;t have been that much better and the guy with 10 million and the guy with a 100 million still eat the same steak at the nice restaurant. </p>

<p>Anyway, funny coincidence that 50 mill he lost plus the 10 million he referenced as being enough saved that he was able to walk away, and now he gets 60 million after a number of years towing the line. </p>

<p>All of it can mean nothing, it&#39;s very possible Dave is just a little crazy, he was often known as a really paranoid guy long before fame. Jim Breuer has told old funny stories about him. </p>

<p>There&#39;s a video of Dave doing stand up earlier in his return to larger venues a couple years back where he &quot;jokingly&quot; references the &quot;illuminati christmas party&quot;</p>

<p>It&#39;s most likely that Dave is much like Patrice or vice versa, two great comics that had too much integrity to sell out so their careers were shot in the foot. Dave made it far by accident, no one thought that little show on comedy central would become a worldwide phenomenon, and when it did, the cabal came looking for their money and their new pied piper to exploit. </p>

<p><em>You</em> know what you mean, even if it&#39;s hard to explain. You can&#39;t read so far into their being off-put by your being incoherent. Because you <em>are</em> raving. People know not trust people who sound so sure of things -- you have to talk about it in a way that shows you understand why it appears otherwise. You can&#39;t just go out there and blurt out random shit like &quot;Google and Facebook <em>lie</em> to you&quot;. It sounds like a paranoid delusion to anyone uninformed on the mechanisms of their content control.</p>

<p>You have to consider the context. If Kanye had found an appropriate forum, one to discuss political issues, and came out and presented rational, coherent, specific points, backed up by evidence, he wouldn&#39;t have ended up in the mental hospital. If you don&#39;t even know how to get to your show on time and play music for the people who paid to hear it, you can&#39;t pretend to be an enlightened genius who&#39;s doing some great service to mankind. You&#39;re really not.</p>

<p>My point is, context is as important as content. You can be completely right about everything you&#39;re saying, and still say it as an unhinged lunatic who needs mental help.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You say some bold statements that I&#39;m not agreeing with, but I do agree with the most part of your comment.</p>

<p>People go to a Kanye concert to see Kanye. But &#39;seeing&#39; Kanye is not just seeing him, it&#39;s an experience and that experience changes every time he does a show, whether that&#39;s screaming out loud and throwing his microphone at the floor and rushing off like at the Hammersmith Apollo, performing regular tracks, him ranting for 20 mins about being the next Steve Jobs or that Jay-Z has gunners that he&#39;s asking not to kill him. </p>

<p>Not being able to get to your show on time and play music doesn&#39;t rule out him being an &#39;enlightened genius&#39;. There&#39;s so many damn factors of why that statement is wrong. Traffic and time management is a few of them and I won&#39;t go into detail about it. Artists are late for concerts all the fucking time. I waited for Earl Sweatshirt to come on stage at a concert for 2 hours because he was high out of his mind. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t agree with his self titled genius but he&#39;s fucking smart in a lot of ways, and I don&#39;t think arriving late at concerts cancels that out.</p>

<p>And they&#39;ve been using Kanye in particular to send out covert &#39;signal events&#39; using their standard covert system of symbolic doubletalk.  It&#39;s phenomenally useful to them to have someone choosing to represent their &quot;West&quot; symbol for them - the direction associated with the diminishment of the &quot;Light&quot;.  They&#39;ve used it plenty of times before; perhaps most significantly in the &quot;Go West, Young Man&quot; scenario of &quot;The Gold Rush&quot;:  Plenty of &quot;Chariots&quot; (in the form of covered wagons, destination: the diminishment of the &quot;Light&quot;, motivation: profit.  And isn&#39;t that the early co-ordination symbolism for exactly what came to pass later on.</p>

<p>So you get two different things being organized here with Kanye: overtly, an implementation of their overt political &#39;fake rebellion&#39; using their own people, and a covert signal organizing them to &#39;diminish the &quot;Light&quot;&#39; of the legit dissenting public by lowering their standards via the various prominently placed sellouts and shills.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If well-connected people really need you not to talk, there are things they can do that leave pretty much no evidence. </p>

<p>One of them is hospitalization with electro shock therapy. It was 15 years ago about, and on a super super small scale crime-wise. But I spoke to family and friends about trafficking and violent ritual abuse and was punished with ECT throughout ages 7-10 years old. </p>

<p>It can wipe out memory, simply scare a person, or just confuse the hell out of them.</p>

<p>I think someone wanted him to STFU. I lived in a little shitty town in the Midwest and people did this to me. Someone definitely could have and probably did to it to Kanye. He has a lot of fans who probably aren&#39;t that &quot;woke&quot; </p>

Now I realize he really is an outspoken individual that is trying to help people.

    <div class="md"><p>No offense to you, but that was hardly a &quot;critical analysis&quot; of the lyrical content of &quot;New Slaves&quot;. It was a rather shallow review and summation of one persons opinion of a songs lyrics. The lyrics themselves are pretty straightforward and literal. No interpretation necessary.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not a fan of West. I don&#39;t particularly dislike him. What I dislike in general is the notion that successful people are elevated and showered with praise because of said success. It doesn&#39;t take a genius, as Kanye has been labeled multiple times in various arenas, to sell a million records to 12-18 year old dudes. I know his target is much broader but I&#39;m sure the demo I mentioned bought a million Kanye records. Impressing the highly impressionable is not the acid test for genius.</p>

<p>What bothers me about Kanye is that he thinks he&#39;s smart. He is probably above average for his peer group and industry compatriots, but not set against the total population. That is the definition of narcissism. Of uncontrolled vanity that is constantly reinforced by the company he keeps and the media.</p>

<p>The subject matter in question, that of &quot;New Slaves&quot;, is nothing new. It is old hat. The idea that we live in a society that practices capitalism and therefore we are slaves to the almighty dollar is as old as the country we live in. Race is no longer the divisive force it once was. We are a people that measures our worth by our wealth. We are classists. We are comfortable with people who reside in our own neighborhoods, work in the same offices, and go to the same schools as our children. Wealth can also be attributed education/intellect. Once again, we are comfortable with our peers. We speak the same language, use a similar vocabulary, and enjoy the same media. We shop at the same stores, wear the same clothes, and eat the same foods. We share each others aspirations and largely, the same values. A middle class white has far more in common with a middle class black than a poor white. The poor and middle class come from two vastly different worlds. </p>

<p>The notion that race is still a factor in determining our worth in society is antiquated. Our worth is irrevocably tied to our income. Does Kanye think that a rich white person is treated any differently than our black brethren? The only color that matters in America is GREEN and how much you have.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I respect your reply but I have to disagree. There are more prisoners in America today than there were slaves in the 1800s. In the song New Slaves Kanye mentions the DEA teaming up with the CCA. Kanye also goes on to mention that slavery never truly disappeared it actually got worse. Basically these private prison&#39;s go after these poor African communities who&#39;s only way to make a respectable income is to sell drugs. Then these large corporations like AT&amp;T, Victoria Secret, Boeing, etc. are using free prison labor to line there pockets. So it&#39;s basically slavery in a new form hence New Slaves. Here&#39;s a link that better explains the evilness of the private prison system - <a href="https://youtu.be/yqQa_0gM6hg">https://youtu.be/yqQa_0gM6hg</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Edit: I forgot to mention that African Americans were specifically targeted in the Nixon campaign against the war on drugs. Even members of his campaign have come out to say this. Also race is still very prevalent in deciding your treatment in America. The social aspects of racism have definitely changed, but these small plantation slave owners back then have transformed into large scale prison corporations that run business off of mainly black people who have no rights (read 13th amendment). Whites, Mexicans, and Blacks commit crime at roughly the same rate but the majority of prisoners are black. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That private prisons &quot;go after&quot; any ethnicity more than another is flawed logic. The prisons go after no one. The criminal justice system arrests and prosecutes.</p>

<p>The notion that the only respectable way to make a living is to sell drugs is another specious assertion. They could get an education, a job, avoid committing crimes, and prosper. But that&#39;s just me. People are responsible for their own choices. It seems the people in question made the choice to enslave themselves, if that&#39;s the vernacular we are using. They choose to engage in criminal activity and poison their own communities while they are at it.</p>

<p>It&#39;s classic blame shifting. Uninspired and lacking in insight. It is good that Kanye has developed a social conscience, but he also needs an education. The opinions he is expressing are not new and they are not really logically sound. He is also a hypocrite. He sells $200 T-Shirts while promoting a lifestyle that is destroying his community.</p>

<p>I respect your opinion as well, I just find these ideas extremely reductive sophomoric.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Kanye was undergoing a spiritual awakening and breaking away from the system of control in front of our very eyes, with the amount of followers and fans he had, it couldn&#39;t be allowed to go on for much longer. </p>

<p>It&#39;s not difficult to notice a stark difference in the man before he was taken away to UCLA in handcuffs. Actual handcuffs guys? Come on. Just look at the footage of Kanye meeting the newly announced  President of the United States, you really think the only words he manages to utter out are &#39;I just want to take a picture right now?&#39; His whole demeanor and manner is completely off and it&#39;s plain to see.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>People around here need to realize something. </p>

<p><em>You</em> know what you mean, even if it&#39;s hard to explain. You can&#39;t read so far into their being off-put by your being incoherent. Because you <em>are</em> raving. People know not trust people who sound so sure of things -- you have to talk about it in a way that shows you understand why it appears otherwise. You can&#39;t just go out there and blurt out random shit like &quot;Google and Facebook <em>lie</em> to you&quot;. It sounds like a paranoid delusion to anyone uninformed on the mechanisms of their content control.</p>

<p>You have to consider the context. If Kanye had found an appropriate forum, one to discuss political issues, and came out and presented rational, coherent, specific points, backed up by evidence, he wouldn&#39;t have ended up in the mental hospital. If you don&#39;t even know how to get to your show on time and play music for the people who paid to hear it, you can&#39;t pretend to be an enlightened genius who&#39;s doing some great service to mankind. You&#39;re really not.</p>

<p>My point is, context is as important as content. You can be completely right about everything you&#39;re saying, and still say it as an unhinged lunatic who needs mental help.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Kanye is a very complicated figure. It&#39;s very obvious that he has battled issues with his mental health on and off, he&#39;s usually the first to admit that. It&#39;s right there in a lot of his music. His self awareness is a big part of his appeal (along with being a fantastic producer), vulnerability coupled with bravado.</p>

<p>That said, the media and society at large like to equate these issues with total madness, as opposed to the types of struggles that many of us also face. Any time Kanye says anything, it can be easily written off as &quot;Oh he&#39;s just crazy&quot;, even if it&#39;s something that carries a lot of truth like the George Bush/Katrina comments. The contents of his music and his social media personality make it too easy to dismiss stuff like this, which is a shame.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Once again, we live in a classist society. Poverty has been criminalized to a large degree. Regardless of your race, in America, the poor have fewer rights and options than those that are not.</p>

<p>If the corner boys want to go to college for eight years and earn a degree then sell pharmaceutical drugs at therapeutic doses to people who meet the diagnostic criteria for an illness or disorder as defined by medical science, then sure, they can sell drugs. You&#39;re comparing selling crack and heroin to Prozac or antibiotics. Do you not see the lunacy in that way of thinking?</p>

<p>There are lots of reasons why 1/8th of the world goes to bed hungry every night. Some of them aren&#39;t man made such as famine or drought. Others are caused by totalitarian regimes and despotic war lords who control the distribution of food stuffs as a means of exerting power. None of this I germane to the conversation we are having.</p>

<p>Kanye says black people in this country are still slaves but now it is economic slavery and is perpetrated by the for profit prison system. That the whole of the criminal justice system conspires to lock up innocent black people as a means of free labor for large corporations. This is farce.</p>

<p>If I were in prison, I would rather have a job than stay in my cell all day everyday. This an opportunity to learn new skills that could translate into more employment options when I was released. There may be some modest compensation as well.</p>

<p>You can choose to disagree with my assessment If you like but the inescapable truth is that if everyone quit having kids they couldn&#39;t afford, stuck around to raise them, earned a degree or certification in a trade, and got a job they wouldn&#39;t have any problems. They would not end up in prison. The only slavery is the hell of our own mistakes.</p>
