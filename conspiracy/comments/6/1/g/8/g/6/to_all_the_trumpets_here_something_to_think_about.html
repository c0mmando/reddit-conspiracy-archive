<p>&quot;In an ever-changing, incomprehensible world the masses had reached the point where they would, at the same time, believe everything and nothing, think that everything was possible and that nothing was true. ... Mass propaganda discovered that its audience was ready at all times to believe the worst, no matter how absurd, and did not particularly object to being deceived because it held every statement to be a lie anyhow. The totalitarian mass leaders based their propaganda on the correct psychological assumption that, under such conditions, one could make people believe the most fantastic statements one day, and trust that if the next day they were given irrefutable proof of their falsehood, they would take refuge in cynicism; instead of deserting the leaders who had lied to them, they would protest that they had known all along that the statement was a lie and would admire the leaders for their superior tactical cleverness.&quot;</p>

<p>Incorrect. They are the ones most involved in the political process - not apathetic twats who cling to &quot;facts&quot; and then elect an autocrat because they need to be even poorer.</p>

<p>That&#39;s right! It was the Democrats who were in control of the executive branch when we invaded Afghanistan and Iraq, ending the lives of over 4000 thousand Americans and hundreds of thousands, if not over a million, lives in Afghanistan and Iraq. 3000 Americans dead on 9/11 definitely wasn&#39;t enough - we needed to kill off a bunch of the dumb brainwashed kids who joined up.</p>

<p>When did Mao run in an election against Hitler?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That same quote applies to the MSM, as well (which is almost uniformly aligned against Trump).</p>

<p>All of it is divide and conquer psyops, anyway. Neither the demoncrats nor the repugnicans are working towards reducing the entanglements of the US military. Neither party has done anything to enhance the transparency of government since before my lifetime. Nether party believes in our rights to privacy, free speech, or due process.</p>

<p>You can say this &quot;applies to the MSM&quot; but it&#39;s bullshit, for multiple glaring reasons.</p>

<p>I can go read CNN right now, I can fact check their statements, are they biased? Sure, but the outright lies are few and far between.</p>

<p>Donald Trump on the other hand? Nearly everything he says is provably false, and not just provably false, but blatantly false on every level possible.</p>

<p>You should ask yourself why Donald Trump made a key pillar of his strategy to attack the media and discredit anyone that could possibly prove him wrong, think long and hard about that, and then go look into what other dictators have done historically when coming into power and tell me if you notice any patterns.</p>

<p>Like when the NYT reported he treated women badly and then the lynchpin in their article said they misconstrued her words and had lied to her from the start?</p>

<p>Like when CNN said <a href="https://pics.onsizzle.com/sunn-cnn-nancy-sinatra-is-not-happy-trump-will-use-12684455.png">Nancy Sinatra didn&#39;t want Trump using her father&#39;s music?</a></p>

<p>Like when people keep posting that Trump landed at the same airport as a Russian, but don&#39;t mention that he had reporters on his plane, that the Russian donated to Hillary or that his schedule was public for days in advance?</p>

<p>How about like when the NYT said he was wiretapped, and then turned around and said he wasn&#39;t, when he said he had been?</p>

<p>When the media refused to report on Chicago when it was revealed that Hillary had people birddogging? </p>

<p>Or like how the MSM is now saying the CIA are sweeties, as is GWB?</p>

<p>Or like when they refused to report that Hillary had been given the debate questions?</p>

<p>Trump is not wrong about <em>everything</em>. He is actually quite demonstrably and strategically correct about a lot of things. The fact that you rely on semantics to support your thesis that he is wrong about everything stands out to a truly neutral observer.</p>

<p>Your denial of this truth demonstrates the strength of this propaganda on you. Trump knew he was being monitored, get over it. &quot;Wiretapping&quot; is an obsolete concept in the world of mass-digital surveillance. Don&#39;t be a victim of the divide and conquer tactics.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>LOL. Alright man, this is impossible, here&#39;s food for thought.</p>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Thanks to this self-insulating logic, attempting to refute a conspiracy theory is like nailing jelly to a wall. Since conspiracy theories are inherently unproven, the theory is always a work in progress, able to dodge refutation by inventing new twists and turns. Each debunking can be construed as disinformation designed to throw truth seekers off the scent, while the conspiracy theorists’ continued failure to blow the lid off the conspiracy merely testifies to the power of their enemy (and the gullibility of the masses). Conspiracy theories aren’t just immune to refutation—they thrive on it. If it looks like a conspiracy, it was a conspiracy. If it doesn’t look like a conspiracy, it was definitely a conspiracy. Evidence against the conspiracy theory becomes evidence of conspiracy. Heads I win, tails you lose.</p>

I am <em>skeptical</em> of institutions that give themselves stellar reviews (like the CBO, or the BLS). Believe in them at your peril. This &quot;recovery&quot; has worn on for almost 10 years, now.  Do you know what happened? The rich got even richer (and more powerful), while the middle class and the poor got fucked with no lube or foreplay.

<p>Quit busting out your lame quotes and start using your own words, like an adult. I am so mad that you think this shit is ok... 10 years before now, we were then at <em>the greatest wealth gap in human history</em>, as we were 10 years before that.

<p>The majority of uses of Pepe the Frog have been, and continue to be, non-bigoted. However, it was inevitable that, as the meme proliferated in on-line venues such as 4chan, 8chan, and Reddit, which have many users who delight in creating racist memes and imagery, a subset of Pepe memes would come into existence that centered on racist, anti-Semitic or other bigoted themes.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ok, so this right here - this is a false statement? There aren&#39;t large subsets of white nationalists on the internet spamming pepe the frog, often in a racist way? That&#39;s an absurd statement?</p>

<p>So ready for me to show you how I know you didn&#39;t read it?</p>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>However, because so many Pepe the Frog memes are not bigoted in nature, it is important to examine use of the meme only in context. The mere fact of posting a Pepe meme does not mean that someone is racist or white supremacist. However, if the meme itself is racist or anti-Semitic in nature, or if it appears in a context containing bigoted or offensive language or symbols, then it may have been used for hateful purposes.</p>
