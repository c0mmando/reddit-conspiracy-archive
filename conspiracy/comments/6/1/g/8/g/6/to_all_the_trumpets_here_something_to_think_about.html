         "In an ever-changing, incomprehensible world the masses had reached the point where they would, at the same time, believe everything and nothing, think that everything was possible and that nothing was true. ... Mass propaganda discovered that its audience was ready at all times to believe the worst, no matter how absurd, and did not particularly object to being deceived because it held every statement to be a lie anyhow. The totalitarian mass leaders based their propaganda on the correct psychological assumption that, under such conditions, one could make people believe the most fantastic statements one day, and trust that if the next day they were given irrefutable proof of their falsehood, they would take refuge in cynicism; instead of deserting the leaders who had lied to them, they would protest that they had known all along that the statement was a lie and would admire the leaders for their superior tactical cleverness."

       Incorrect. They are the ones most involved in the political process - not apathetic twats who cling to "facts" and then elect an autocrat because they need to be even poorer.

       That's right! It was the Democrats who were in control of the executive branch when we invaded Afghanistan and Iraq, ending the lives of over 4000 thousand Americans and hundreds of thousands, if not over a million, lives in Afghanistan and Iraq. 3000 Americans dead on 9/11 definitely wasn't enough - we needed to kill off a bunch of the dumb brainwashed kids who joined up.

       it was a metaphor, genius, where HRC was Mao and Trump has the stache...

       That same quote applies to the MSM, as well (which is almost uniformly aligned against Trump).
      </p>
      <p>
       All of it is divide and conquer psyops, anyway. Neither the demoncrats nor the repugnicans are working towards reducing the entanglements of the US military. Neither party has done anything to enhance the transparency of government since before my lifetime. Nether party believes in our rights to privacy, free speech, or due process.

       Listen, this is a deflection and you know it's a deflection.

      <p>
       You can say this "applies to the MSM" but it's bullshit, for multiple glaring reasons.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can go read CNN right now, I can fact check their statements, are they biased? Sure, but the outright lies are few and far between.
      </p>
      <p>
       Donald Trump on the other hand? Nearly everything he says is provably false, and not just provably false, but blatantly false on every level possible.
      </p>
      <p>
       You should ask yourself why Donald Trump made a key pillar of his strategy to attack the media and discredit anyone that could possibly prove him wrong, think long and hard about that, and then go look into what other dictators have done historically when coming into power and tell me if you notice any patterns.

       The peoples of the Western world are
       <em>
        obviously
       </em>
       being gaslighted for internal division.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump is not wrong about
       <em>
        everything
       </em>
       . He is actually quite demonstrably and strategically correct about a lot of things. The fact that you rely on semantics to support your thesis that he is wrong about everything stands out to a truly neutral observer.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your denial of this truth demonstrates the strength of this propaganda on you. Trump knew he was being monitored, get over it. "Wiretapping" is an obsolete concept in the world of mass-digital surveillance. Don't be a victim of the divide and conquer tactics.

         Thanks to this self-insulating logic, attempting to refute a conspiracy theory is like nailing jelly to a wall. Since conspiracy theories are inherently unproven, the theory is always a work in progress, able to dodge refutation by inventing new twists and turns. Each debunking can be construed as disinformation designed to throw truth seekers off the scent, while the conspiracy theorists’ continued failure to blow the lid off the conspiracy merely testifies to the power of their enemy (and the gullibility of the masses). Conspiracy theories aren’t just immune to refutation—they thrive on it. If it looks like a conspiracy, it was a conspiracy. If it doesn’t look like a conspiracy, it was definitely a conspiracy. Evidence against the conspiracy theory becomes evidence of conspiracy. Heads I win, tails you lose.

       how old are you? I find it very nice that you consider yourself a
       <em>
        believer

       . I am a
       <em>

       . I am
       <em>
        skeptical

       of institutions that give themselves stellar reviews (like the CBO, or the BLS). Believe in them at your peril. This "recovery" has worn on for almost 10 years, now.  Do you know what happened? The rich got even richer (and more powerful), while the middle class and the poor got fucked with no lube or foreplay. We are currently facing the
       <em>
        greatest wealth gap in HUMAN HISTORY
       </em>
       and you think
       <em>
        I'M
       </em>
       crazy for questioning the people who tell me that it's great (or that
       <em>
        this
       </em>
       is progress)??? Holy fuck, you must be stupid, or evil...
      </p>
      <p>
       Quit busting out your lame quotes and start using your own words, like an adult. I am so mad that you think this shit is ok... 10 years before now, we were then at
       <em>
        the greatest wealth gap in human history
       </em>
       , as we were 10 years before that. You are really clueless, or truly have malice for other people. Learn to question your premises, or repeat the same mistakes forever.

       If you don't like this Trump 1.0, you really aren't going to like 2.0, because he is here for the long haul. He has done more for NWO in a 100 days, than most have done in 4 years, it's so obvious a blind man can see it. Instead of buying into the narrative of things are going to get better, I'm saying people better get their shit together ASAP and not worry about the puppetmasters puppet, but more about
       <em>
        self protection

       You also associate Pepe with being a hate symbol, but then blah, blah some random defense.

       I mean i agree with the fact that hes been wrong and lied. But the media on both sides has been caught covering up lies in different ways. My point was dont try to single out a group when really anything to do with either political party is going to have ties to loes and corruption.

       pirate party is primarily about a free and open internet. They did incredibly well in the last Icelandic election and are growing rapidly in Europe.

      <p>
       Voteflux is an entirely new way of government. Instead of politicians making decisions that, for example, scientists ought to be making everyone has the ability to have their say.
      </p>
      <p>
       Google will be your friend in this case. The voteflux site has an awesome video that breaks down the idea.

       The Downvote happy Trump fanatics are here again. Trump and Hillary are basically a slower acting poison compared to a quicker acting poison. It's still the same thing; poison.

       If hillary led you, she will sabotage the american economy for obama and wage war with russia and china and making decisions for Russia and China which will result in american defeat and disaster.

       A Trump leading screnario it's basically the same thing, but it happens in a much slower pace. Don't forget Soros and Hillary are still behind the scenes destablilizing places like Hong Kong via criminal ngos who want nothing but money and power. Alas, Trump will be disposed pretty quickly as soon as the elite find the chance to.

       It's not a deflection, Trump didn't start the mass surveillance or have a part of the nasty dark history of the abc organizations that's created this totalitarian corporatist America we live in. He's got the potential to do a lot of bad shit, but he hasn't even been president for that long. Anyway, just because trump's supporters spam this subreddit all the time doesn't mean everyone here agrees with them or supports Trump.

       I've also pretty much had it with 'spam this subreddit.' Trump's numbers are at 50% approval; this means that approx. half of the US supports him, translating to a sizable number of legit conspiracy theorists being Trump supporters. Anyone suggesting that there should be no Trump supporters on here are suggesting this sub should go the way of r/edacted. I'm a lurker, not a poster, but getting sick of that shit. There are like two places left that anyone who supports Trump can even be anymore, indicating the constant erosion of the 1st amendment. This sub can't be under constant pressure to hide political leanings or be leftist--or go away.

       It's all cult dynamics, whether you believe in Trump and follow him or if you believe in Hillary and follow her.  Obama himself had a strong cult following. Who can forget that?  Yes We Can!

       Lol. Has anyone ever killed another over a Pepe?
      </p>
      <p>
       How about over the Star of David?
      </p>
      <p>
       How about over the US flag? Where's the ADL on the Maple Leaf?
      </p>
      <p>
       Chinese Flag?
      </p>

       Lol, the thinness of your argument for Pepe as a hate symbol leaves you exposed to all manner of nonsense.
