       I saw a post earlier that said that the Pizzagate/Pedogate protests need to continue for months on end, and I wholeheartedly agree. Think about it, there are shills on this subreddit. There are shills on just about every subreddit imaginable. Whether it's a Shareblue shill, Russian shill, or even a Taco Bell shill. All across the board, Reddit can agree that there are shills.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is pretty apparent to me that there is an active brigade against Pedogate. R/Pizzagate got shut down for crying out loud. Sure, you can say that there were aspects of a "witchhunt" and that some personal information may have been posted by people that didn't know better, but there is still one fact that we must acknowledge; the shills.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's think for a second. What kind of pizza shop owner has the power to have shills at his disposal. Another question: Why and how is James Alefantis so powerful? Yes, I am aware that all evidence regarding Pizzagate is only circumstantial, and that researchers are just "connecting dots that don't exist", but at what point do we all agree that Pizzagate is a little weird? We truly must protest to get the officials to pursue an investigation. I saw this mentioned in a Tweet, and it's pretty damn true, something along the lines of "The FBI can find Tom Brady's jersey in Mexico, but they can't find the Missing DC Girls?".
      </p>
      <p>
       There are too many dots that have been connected. There are crooked cops everywhere we look. You have to compare these protests to the idea of Pizzagate/Pedogate in general. People are going to walk by and laugh, they'll walk by again and wonder, then they'll research, then they'll probably be on our side. The problem is, people don't want to believe that our beloved politicians are pedophiles. If you're pretty deep into conspiracy theories, you know how deep this rabbit hole goes. "Normies" don't want to literally have their whole reality changed. We oftentimes look down on people that are "stuck in the matrix", but you have to realize that they've fallen victim to a false reality.
      </p>
      <p>
       My point is, we smelled shit, and we think it's coming from the dog house; Washington D.C./Langley, VA (CIA HQ). The government has committed sins that I would truly consider to be abominable. MKUltra; using mind control on
       <strong>
        UNWITTING
       </strong>
       United States citizens, that's really all I have to mention. MKUltra, is enough to get every citizen thinking about the intentions of the US government. There's a whole Wikipedia article on Human Rights Violations committed by the CIA; it's like 20 pages long.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is it really that absurd to imagine that the government/ABC agencies could be trafficking children/organ harvesting. There's a lot of money involved, just like in the drug war. The government has sold drugs themselves. The people that start wars. The people that centralized the banks? What is the government hiding from us?
      </p>
      <p>
       All I've got to say is that the the correlation between the use of "Fake News" and "Pizzagate" is honestly uncanny. Pizzagate is where the term "Fake News" came from, similar to how the term "Conspiracy Theorist" was birthed from the suspicions around John F. Kennedy's murder. I truly think they're scared. We have to keep letting our presence be known. We have to raise the heat. We need to get the whistle blowers out of the hole. I think we found something that something we weren't supposed to find.
      </p>
      <p>
       If people at a Pizzagate protests point to demons, aliens, inter-dimensional-beings, gremlins, I can only conclude one thing; there is someone behind the curtain, and it is evil itself. How far have we come, to the point where we literally think our politicians might be, and very well could be demons, fallen angels, aliens, reptilians, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think the veil is finally being lifted. The rose-tinted goggles are coming off, as are the gloves. The people are waking up. My final question: If John Podesta is so sure there nothing malicious is going on, how about you go on air and explain your emails? It's not that hard.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just saying.

       Could anyone tell me about Pizzagate / Pedogate? Basically it would be to catch up. I know it can be difficult, but it is easier for someone who knows the subject, explain it to me, rather than if I start looking and reading without know nothing.

       Basically wikileaks either leaked themselves or got ahold of podestas emails and theyre littered with odd common pedophilia codewords along with mentions of children throughout.
If youd like i could send you 2 videos that will get you pretty up to date.

       This is David Seaman's video, he is one of the first journalists to start reporting on pizzagate. Since then Youtube has demonitized his videos and many major news outlets have punlicly denounced him.

       I'm skeptical on Pizzagate (could be a psy-op) but I'm maintaining an open mind simply due to the fact that other things like this have been exposed in the past from the elite establishment across the world, often times with heavy pushback and denial in the beginning of investigations. It's not impossible something like this could be happening, and there is certainly a lot of circumstantial evidence presented in the community findings. There's no actual hard proof...yet. It hasnt been proven fact or fiction in any way. The fact no formal investigation has even been made into this being a possibility is what really drives it home for me. MSM is so furiously attacking this as "fake news" that it's only adding fuel to the conspiracy fire IMO. I'm hoping there will be more facts and info to come soon so this can be put to bed as either fact or fiction once and for all.
      </p>
      <p>
       Investigations are frequently launched by circumstantial evidence to gather more and hard evidence.

       Really well put together. I completely agree with you especially in the sense that the individuals thay are unwilling to open their eyes or unknowing that their eyes are closed are the victims. We should be helping to convince them instead of putting them down and thereby closing them off from the truth.

       Pizzagate is too witch-hunty in my opinion. You're literally naming tons of people as pedophiles. That is an extremely damaging claim to make against a person or persons. What if Comet pizza was actually completely legitimate, Alefantis was actually innocent, but because of crazy rumors, the business loses so much business they have to close. You just put several employees out of work, and ruined a man's business. Not only that, but what if the guy that had gone in there with guns had actually killed someone? You people promoting pizzagate would have literally been tangentially responsible for someone's death.

       If you all are so gung-ho about saving the children then why don't all of you believers pool your resources and I don't know, hire a D.C. private investigator to look into the matter?

       What if Comet Pizza is actually completely illegitimate, Alefantis is actually guilty, and because of crazy rumors, hundreds, if not thousands of children are no longer being sexually abused.

       Well we asked the officials to investigate, but they wouldn't. Maybe that's because D.C. police chief is Peter Newsham is best buddies with James Alefantis.

       You have to realize that WE are the private investigators. A network of people that see through the lies.

       And where did you get your Private Investigating credentials again? Many private investigators have worked in related fields previously, mostly Law-enforcement of some kind. Let the pro's take a crack at it.

       what if you are a pedophile and have a sex dungeon in your basement, even if I can't proof it or have evidence, but if I just believe really hard it must be true.
      </p>
      <p>
       obviously this is a joke and you are probably not a pedophile, but what if you are, are we going to take the risk of children getting hurt.

       The Local PD and FBI have no problem investigating ANY allegation made from ANY person regarding ANY suspicious activity. But get a tons of circumstantial evidence that some guy is running a child trafficking service in his basement and not a SINGLE investigation is attempted.

       Not officials man, a private investigator. If they were offered good money and refused to investigate, then maybe something is weird. But I think it'd be a good idea to try if you guys really are that convinced of it. Just trying to constructively help you guys figure it out, instead of inspired vigilantes with who knows what mental issues just showing up at places like Comet Pizza with guns.

       Im not convinced by the evidence in the same manner I'm not convinced by the evidence of The Loch Ness monster. Some of the pictures sure look like a Plesiosaur, but when you actually realize it's a piece of drift-wood it's like "oh, well that was lame".

       I'm skeptical on Pizzagate (could be a psy-op) but I'm maintaining an open mind simply due to the fact that other things like this have been exposed in the past from the elite establishment across the world, often times with heavy pushback and denial in the beginning of investigations. It's not impossible something like this could be happening, and there is certainly a lot of circumstantial evidence presented in the community findings. There's no actual hard proof...yet. It hasnt been proven fact or fiction in any way. The fact no formal investigation has even been made into this being a possibility is what really drives it home for me. MSM is so furiously attacking this as "fake news" that it's only adding fuel to the conspiracy fire IMO. I'm hoping there will be more facts and info to come soon so this can be put to bed as either fact or fiction once and for all.

       Investigations are frequently launched by circumstantial evidence to gather more and hard evidence.

       I mean I feel like I have. Unless I missed something, you guys have been saying he shot a computer hard drive. He didn't, he hit the motherboard, after firing a bullet at a door handle to try to open it. Said bullet penetrated the door, and lodged into the computer in the office which turned out to be an ordinary office and not a secret torture chamber entrance. And ok they moved the camera or something? Still not that strange in my opinion. Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence, of which I haven't seen anything beyond wild speculation and conjecture.

       Can you show me some of the evidence for Russiagate that isn't some article speculating about what some unnamed sources or intelligence agencies said? That was the kind of evidence we got for the Iraq war, just had to take their word for it, and look how that turned out.

       Well I guess they need more to go on than circumstantial evidence. Makes sense to me.

         I think you should give notice when changing strategies which have been long in place.
        </strong>
        I immediately realized something was different by the
        <strong>
         shape of the box
        </strong>
        and I contemplated who would be sending me something in the square shaped box. Lo and behold, instead of
        <strong>
         pasta and wonderful sauces,
        </strong>
        it was a lovely,
        <strong>
         tempting
        </strong>
        assortment of
        <strong>
         cheeses
        </strong>
        , Yummy. I am awaiting the return of my children and grandchildren from their holiday travels so that we can
        <strong>
         demolish
        </strong>
        them.
       </p>
       <p>
        Thank you so much. I hope you and your gang are well.
       </p>
       <p>
        miss you both

        </strong>
        on
        <strong>
         cheese

       Literally nothing nefarious and not that hard to figure out here. He is writing people he plays Dominoes with, who sent him a gift basket. Usually they send him pastas and sauces, but this time, sent fancy cheeses. He postulates that cheese may be the secret to the other person winning, and wonders if he'll do better having eaten delicious cheese than if he ate pasta, ya know as a really old people-ish joke.
