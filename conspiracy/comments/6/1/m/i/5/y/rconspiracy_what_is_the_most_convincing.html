    <div class="md"><p>I heard an interview with a film-maker named Jay Weidner who seemed very confident that the technique of front-screen projection was used to film the moon scenes, a favorite technique of Kubrick.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve also heard that 2001: A Space Odyssey was government funded and that the original credits included &quot;thank yous&quot; to NASA and maybe other government agencies. It had a massive budget, enormously big for the time. Makes sense that it was some kind of &quot;practice run&quot; for some of the methods used to film Apollo.</p>

<p>The Shining seems to contain some clues about the moon landings, such as the Apollo 11 sweater that Danny wears, the &quot;A11 work and no play makes Jack a dull boy&quot; scene, and others.</p>

<p>The most plausible thing I can imagine is that he at least helped them film the first production or sort of oversaw it to make sure it was done &quot;correctly.&quot; At that point he probably wanted out, but was obviously forced to stay quiet about it and probably threatened. His looks do seem to deteriorate as if he&#39;s under a lot of stress around the time of The Shining -- I&#39;ve even heard it speculated that the way that Jack Nicholson&#39;s character starts out clean-shaven and bright-eyed but ends up scraggly, grizzled, and crazy-eyed is sort of an autobiographical sketch of Kubrick&#39;s own descent into stress and paranoia.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My question is though, why fake it? Is it that the Christian zealots are right and we live under a Firmament and we&#39;re all subject to magic-logic? Is it that our technology isn&#39;t there yet but we still could go at some point in the future? My one biggest obstacle buying that the moon landings were faked is there&#39;s never a good reason given why to fake them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The reasons for faking it are fairly simple: JFK made the declaration in 1961 that we would put a man on the moon before the end of the decade. This was only 3 years after NASA had been formed. I&#39;ve always assumed he was being honest and was simply not aware of the technical challenges of going to the moon at the time. By the middle of the decade we were embroiled in a space race with the USSR and they were throughly kicking our ass, sending the first satellite, the first animal, and the first man into space and manufacturing superior rockets. </p>

<p>JFK was out of the picture at this point obviously, and faking the moon landing was a way of fulfilling his goal and pacifying the American public, assuring them we were still on the right track. It was our way of winning the space race, by cheating since we couldn&#39;t win it fairly. Another huge reason was to distract from the increasingly ugly Vietnam War. You&#39;ll notice that every time some new setback or embarrassing hangup happened in Vietnam, there were the Apollo astronauts ready to blast off and return to the moon again. </p>

<p>It was also extremely profitable for the hoaxers as they made money off everything from television ratings to freeze-dried space food. </p>

<p>If you want to get serious about this and have that question answered probably better than I can, you should read Wagging The Moondoggie by Dave McGowan. I would link to it but I&#39;m on mobile about to board a plane. It&#39;s free online in PDF form and you can easily find it with a Google search. It&#39;s funny, too. He has a good sense of humor but really leaves no doubt that it was a hoax. </p>

Tesla is a for profit puppet, promising us half centruy old tech while charging us 100k for that &#39;free&#39; energy. Everything he says he is going to do has been done by our government. And yet our government funds him and openly promotes his endeavors. Musk is here to ensure profit on this tech, a slow calculate disclosure.</p>

<blockquote>
<ol>
<li><p>How was a skinny 19-year-old boy with no military training capable of killing 26 people clean while injuring none? (Trained military veterans have claimed it was highly unlikely or even impossible for someone with the weight of Adam Lanza to execute that many people in so short a time.)</p></li>
<li><p>Why was there no evidence of blood? A total of 26 fatalities (children and adult) would produce at least at a conservative estimate 20 gallons (75 liters) of blood. Thus would require a concerted blood cleanup (blood is considered a biohazard in this type of situation), yet when Sofia Smallstorm asked who did the cleanup, all the departments were ignorant of it and even claimed that no one did the cleanup.</p></li>
<li><p>Where are the alleged 600+ children of Sandy Hook Elementary School? Why is there absolutely no photo or video evidence of any dead bodies?</p></li>
</ol>

<p>This is just barely scratching the surface. Highly recommend reading through it all.</p>
