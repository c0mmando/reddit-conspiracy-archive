       If it's an addiction then you can be weaned off of it. Taper your sleep over time and see what happens.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I have a suspicion that sleep is life food or water, weaning off will just result in death. Therefore it's not an addiction, it's a life requirement.

       It's an addiction! Try quitting heroin after doing it since you were a baby... it's not easy... and if you stop you suffer from all kinds of terrible withdrawls. I know you are brainwashed... prolly just as addicted to it as everyone else... it is easier to just give in to the drug, than it is to suffer the effects of not having it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sounds like quite the enabler saying that it is a life requirement... prolly in the pocket of Big Mattress and Big Pajama... I don't blame you though... they don't call it "Counting Sheep" for nothing.

       I heard an interview with a film-maker named Jay Weidner who seemed very confident that the technique of front-screen projection was used to film the moon scenes, a favorite technique of Kubrick.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've also heard that 2001: A Space Odyssey was government funded and that the original credits included "thank yous" to NASA and maybe other government agencies. It had a massive budget, enormously big for the time. Makes sense that it was some kind of "practice run" for some of the methods used to film Apollo.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Shining seems to contain some clues about the moon landings, such as the Apollo 11 sweater that Danny wears, the "A11 work and no play makes Jack a dull boy" scene, and others.
      </p>
      <p>
       The most plausible thing I can imagine is that he at least helped them film the first production or sort of oversaw it to make sure it was done "correctly." At that point he probably wanted out, but was obviously forced to stay quiet about it and probably threatened. His looks do seem to deteriorate as if he's under a lot of stress around the time of The Shining -- I've even heard it speculated that the way that Jack Nicholson's character starts out clean-shaven and bright-eyed but ends up scraggly, grizzled, and crazy-eyed is sort of an autobiographical sketch of Kubrick's own descent into stress and paranoia.

       My question is though, why fake it? Is it that the Christian zealots are right and we live under a Firmament and we're all subject to magic-logic? Is it that our technology isn't there yet but we still could go at some point in the future? My one biggest obstacle buying that the moon landings were faked is there's never a good reason given why to fake them.

       The reasons for faking it are fairly simple: JFK made the declaration in 1961 that we would put a man on the moon before the end of the decade. This was only 3 years after NASA had been formed. I've always assumed he was being honest and was simply not aware of the technical challenges of going to the moon at the time. By the middle of the decade we were embroiled in a space race with the USSR and they were throughly kicking our ass, sending the first satellite, the first animal, and the first man into space and manufacturing superior rockets.
      </p>
      <p>
       JFK was out of the picture at this point obviously, and faking the moon landing was a way of fulfilling his goal and pacifying the American public, assuring them we were still on the right track. It was our way of winning the space race, by cheating since we couldn't win it fairly. Another huge reason was to distract from the increasingly ugly Vietnam War. You'll notice that every time some new setback or embarrassing hangup happened in Vietnam, there were the Apollo astronauts ready to blast off and return to the moon again.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was also extremely profitable for the hoaxers as they made money off everything from television ratings to freeze-dried space food.

       If you want to get serious about this and have that question answered probably better than I can, you should read Wagging The Moondoggie by Dave McGowan. I would link to it but I'm on mobile about to board a plane. It's free online in PDF form and you can easily find it with a Google search. It's funny, too. He has a good sense of humor but really leaves no doubt that it was a hoax.

       I was watching a video the other day about Curiosity and how you can see swarms of bugs in the background sometime. With NASA you have to assume whatever they're doing is a bullshit hoax until proven otherwise.

       I believe we have free energy, or something much more efficient than what we use today. I believe we use this to dig DUMBs and further our deep space program. Tesla is a for profit puppet, promising us half centruy old tech while charging us 100k for that 'free' energy. Everything he says he is going to do has been done by our government. And yet our government funds him and openly promotes his endeavors. Musk is here to ensure profit on this tech, a slow calculate disclosure.

       Sandy Hook was fake, top to bottom. There were no kids, no one died, Adam Lanza wasn't a real person, and they demolished the school so no one would ever go look for proof. The entirety of Sandy Hook almost seems like a social experiment to find out how retarded the general public is and whether or not they'll look for evidence that something happened before believing that it did.

          How was a skinny 19-year-old boy with no military training capable of killing 26 people clean while injuring none? (Trained military veterans have claimed it was highly unlikely or even impossible for someone with the weight of Adam Lanza to execute that many people in so short a time.)

        <li>
         <p>
          Why was there no evidence of blood? A total of 26 fatalities (children and adult) would produce at least at a conservative estimate 20 gallons (75 liters) of blood. Thus would require a concerted blood cleanup (blood is considered a biohazard in this type of situation), yet when Sofia Smallstorm asked who did the cleanup, all the departments were ignorant of it and even claimed that no one did the cleanup.

          Where are the alleged 600+ children of Sandy Hook Elementary School? Why is there absolutely no photo or video evidence of any dead bodies?

       From the get-go, the narrative is flawed; kids with autism/ on the spectrum do not like loud noises, so he would not be an experienced shooter.

       Okay, let's say I'm inside a computer simulation. Everything I have ever known or ever will know is also inside the simulation. The "Global Elite" are also inside the computer simulation. That still doesn't affect anything. Sure, it would be weird if true, and I'd be curious why the "Global Elite" are hiding that from us, but it doesn't change anything.

       Medical and scientific fraud. There is an idea held by the majority of the western population that medical and science "experts" which have the best intentions for humankind are the guiding force behind our medical policies, rather than corporatism and greed.
      </p>
      <p>
       The realm of science and medicine is just as rife with corruption, fraud, and conspiracy, but I have found that many of those completely in the know about "mainstream conspiracies" still refuse to acknowledge the blatant undermining of our scientific institutions by rogue interests executing their own agenda.
