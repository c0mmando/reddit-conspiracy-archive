       Hello,

       Have you looked up at the sky lately?

       Will Trump challenge United States, Incorporated?

      <p>
       I will continue to post until I feel there is a change of "pace," and everything slows down... but I don't feel like that's going to happen anytime soon. I don't feel that I am the only one who has suddenly become "awake," at something not being quite right at the moment in the world, whether it being a local change I can see or a global change as detailed below.
      </p>
      <p>
       Please check my older threads for information from end of November 2016 onward.. I have run out of characters because there is just so much shit going on.
      </p>
      <p>
       Apologies if you have read most of this already.. but just check on the recent updates at the bottom to see that whatever is going on is a global phenomenon and not something to turn your nose up at... and it's not stopping.
      </p>
      <p>
       First.. read this -
       <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170113094903/https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2016/10/13/executive-order-coordinating-efforts-prepare-nation-space-weather-events">
        https://web.archive.org/web/20170113094903/https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2016/10/13/executive-order-coordinating-efforts-prepare-nation-space-weather-events
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Regardless what you think, this Order is worded very seriously and encompasses a huge amount of resources in only a short release. It was released rather quickly and;
      </p>
      <p>
       "But the order bypassed the North American Electric Reliability Corp. (NERC), the interstate grid security monitor, which has been developing solar storm protections for the grid since 2012.
      </p>
      <p>
       "It was a surprise to us," said Gerry Cauley, NERC president and CEO."

       What is the Schumann Resonance? Why is it increasing?
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.drjoedispenza.com/blog/consciousness/what-does-the-spike-in-the-schumann-resonance-mean/">
        http://www.drjoedispenza.com/blog/consciousness/what-does-the-spike-in-the-schumann-resonance-mean/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       "On January 31, 2017, for the first time in recorded history, the Schumann resonance reached frequencies of 36+ Hz. It was considered an anomaly when in 2014 this frequency rose from its usual 7.83 Hz to somewhere in the 15-25 Hz levels—so a jump from 7.83 Hz to 36+ Hz is a big deal. That’s more than a five-fold increase in resonant frequency levels. What does this mean to us as inhabitants of Mother Earth? According to neuroscience, frequency recordings of 36+ Hz in the human brain are more associated with a stressed nervous system than a relaxed and healthy one."
      </p>
      <p>
       Information on the "Earth Wobble,".. or pole shift etc. Whatever you want to call it.
      </p>

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       We are wobbling on our axis, which will obviously have consequences on the earth.. if you notice in that plot diagram that the latter half of 2016 looks much more.. extreme. The Earth Wobbling is natural my only correlation in this is that where the graph gets more extreme is where I feel the world has started to respond at a similar pace.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why is this happening? I don't know. So many different things at once, so many theories and facts to digest and dispute.. so much fake information, shit sources!

       For Earth Changes (weather,seismic,volcanic) I started posting around November.. because November is when I started to become "awake," that there is something not quite right with our planet at the moment and it is behaving abnormally.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why do I say this? Most articles state that scientists are "perplexed," or "puzzled," at things that are happening.
      </p>
      <p>
       FYI - All information is from watchers.news, an invaluable resource which is unopinionated and deals in facts. They reference various local institutions.. obviously depending on what the earth change is.
      </p>
      <p>
       (I have cut content from older posts, please see those for additional information)
      </p>
      <p>
       OKAY...
      </p>
      <p>
       STILL WITH ME?
      </p>
      <p>
       Going to pre-face December with some quick facts about Earthquakes.. because most of you will be saying "volcanoes and earthquakes happen all the time." and you'd be RIGHT! they do..
      </p>
      <p>
       but; There have been 257 earthquakes over magnitude 5 and many more very close to this number. Just to put this into perspective on average there is an estimated 3.6 earthquakes of a magnitude of 5-5.9 a day, in the last 9 days there have been an average of 24.8 nearly 7 times what is usual. It is estimated there is a 6-6.9 magnitude earthquake every 3 days, we have had 2.6 a day for the last 9 days. Lastly for the big earthquakes of magnitude 7-7.9 you usually get 1 every 25 days (estimate) there have been an average of 1 a day for the last 9 days. (Stats from End of Dec.)

       I know! Some interesting..colours to boot. Denmark is a beautiful place, interestingly it was the place I saw the most unexplainable sunset which convinced me something wasn't quite right in late 2016.

       I feel you don't belong in r/conspiracy if you think everything above is "unrelated." An increase in seismic/volcanic activity (2016 being the hottest year on record) should not be disregarded and considered just an unrelated coincidence.

       I think it's obvious how all those events are connected. Something is throwing the massive biological system known as Earth out of a state of equilibrium, which is why we're seeing so many highs/lows occurring in the system.

       Seriously wtf, why is this guy getting downvoted for wanting true facts and sources connecting all this. I used to be a believer in this type of stuff but as you do more and more research, you just realize shit happens all the time. There are periods of peace and destruction scattered thought-out all of history. Just because we might be entering into a time of chaos, doesn't mean there is some imminent armageddon doom waiting around the corner.

       Spoiler alert...WE ALL DIE EVENTUALLY. Now that IS imment for every single one of us. Be it through man made means or natural ones.

       I have an open mind for many conspiracies, political and supernatural ones but as said, if you're honestly shaking in terror over what looks like a regular sunset...maybe you should put the keyboard down bro, get out of r/conspiracy for a while and go outside for a bit.
      </p>
      <p>
       I got over the whole doomsday conspiracies when 2012 came and went. You should conserve your energy and put it to good use on researching other topics.

        it was Winfried Otto Schumann who first studied the theoretical aspects of the global resonances of the earth–ionosphere waveguide system, known today as the Schumann resonances. In 1952–1954 Schumann, together with H. L. König, attempted to measure the resonant frequencies.[11][12][13][14] However, it was not until measurements made by Balser and Wagner in 1960–1963[15][16][17][18][19] that adequate analysis techniques were available to extract the resonance information from the background noise.

       The problem is lack of data. All kinds of scare mongering can be done this way.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is how the scientists were able to use a global cool scare in the 70s and then a warming scare in the 90s.

       Extreme weather events have decreased and some say we are in ideal climate conditions.

       Part of this seems to be information overload combined with trying to tie its together in a meaningful way.

       I don't know what is ideal. Bill Nye says 1750. Others say today. It's kind of hard to know.

       Just as 100 years ago it was hard to know about flooding in Angola and dead birds in the Arctic.

       They talk about Arctic ice loss, but never gains. They don't talk about the decrease in typhoons in one region, but they talk about the increase in water in another.

       It doesn't.  We exploded a lot of nuclear devices in that ocean before this and they released a lot more radiation, both in intensity and quantity, without doing much damage.

       A short burst of more concentrated radiation/radioactive materials is less damaging than a drawn out release of less concentrated radiation/radioactive materials.

       Blah blah blah. I'm tired of all this "earth changes" stuff. People were going on about it 10 years ago, still waiting for my happening. I wish someone would approach it intelligently and convincingly instead of just throwing everything at the wall and hoping something sticks. I'm not impressed every time there is a hurricane, or a tornado, or a bunch of fish washed up on the shore, shit happens all the time, it doesn't necessarily mean anything. Like wtf is the schumann resonance mean? They just show a graph with a bunch of colors, but then the graph has no units, no comparison to what is normal, nothing. Someone's always going on about the sun is doing this and that, the core of the eart is changing, etc., but they never properly explain or cite sources or anything. Screw that, then you wonder why no one takes you seriously.

       OP do you know anything about HAARP? You talk about the disruption caused by frequencies which is know information. My question is could this be caused by something controllable? If they know what this can do to our brain (and they do as it's proven) could this be the benevolent way they would use it? I just got into this information lately and read a lot about it. It blew my mind literally.

       Most of the shit you post that seems "troubling" is because of global warming which is fucking with the weather.

       I'd be happy to link you to my website if it didn't reveal so much information about me, but in all likelihood, I've probably watched more sunsets and sunrises than you ever will in your life.
      </p>
      <p>
       Matching photographs of 'special' sunsets or sunrises with the corresponding radar data can allow a person to even predict when some of the most spectacular ones will occur.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here are at least a couple of examples.  I guess I'm lucky I'm not afraid of the sunset, my entire career would be in shambles.
