    <div class="md"><p>This isn&#39;t my area of knowledge and sort of creeps me out, but I remember people talking about how the Church of Satan was in Newtown, CT and there was a Satanic slant to the whole event. Now I don&#39;t think any children actually died that day, but I have heard it spoken of as some kind of ritual child sacrifice, whether literal or symbolic.</p>

<p>One night I was doing some Sandy Hook research and I came across someone who was saying that the photos of the Parker family had been photoshopped, and that the two cute little blond girls were even both doing Satanic hand symbols in one of the photos. This sounded preposterous to me, not being familiar with the Satanic aspect of conspiracy theories, but I looked at the photo and sure enough, there they are, both doing awkward Satanic hand signs that had to have been photoshopped intentionally that way. </p>

<p>Before that I didn&#39;t take the Satan-worship or Satanist thing seriously, but now I can&#39;t really deny that it exists. I don&#39;t know whether they are serious or just putting this imagery in front of us to show their power or to spit on Christianity, but seeing that picture both creeped me out and majorly pissed me off.</p>

<p>Not sure if this is related to PG at all, but yeah I&#39;d say there is some kind of Satanic fuckery going on with the &quot;elites&quot; who are doing these hoaxes and trafficking children. </p>

<p>P.S. The Bataclan &quot;massacre&quot; had a definite Satanic element to it as well</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah and I think the word &quot;Aurora&quot; shows up in that same movie on a building or something.  You&#39;re right that Hollywood is definitely involved and the fact that they put these things in production of movies years before the events they presage just shows the time scale they are working on.

    <div class="md"><p>The Church of Satan is a scam for edgy objectivists that doesn&#39;t believe in any gods, so they wouldn&#39;t have a deity to whom they&#39;d make sacrifices. </p>

<p>By &quot;satanic hand gestures&quot;, are you talking about the &quot;rock on&quot; hand gesture popularized by late rocker Dio?  Fun fact about that, he &quot;stole&quot; that gesture from his grandmother, who like many of her contemporaries, made the gesture to ward off the &quot;evil eye&quot;.  It&#39;s actually an anti-demon gesture, despite what many might think!</p>

<p>Could you post that photo?  I&#39;m curious about if they were actually throwing up the universal symbol for rock and roll, or if they were holding up a very similar gesture that means &quot;I love you&quot; in ASL.</p>

<p>Thanks in advance!</p>

<p>Whatever the hand symbol means -- and like I said, I&#39;m not knowledgeable about the Satanic stuff -- I can&#39;t deny that it was done that way intentionally. This and several other photos involving Sandy Hook are clearly photoshopped.</p>

<p>I forgot about this until I searched for that picture, but there&#39;s even <a href="https://deusnexus.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/satanic-hand-soto-family.jpg?w=610&amp;amp;h=391">another one</a> with some old man doing the same hand thing in the background.

<p>They are.  I was interested in Satanism when I was a cringefest of a teenager, listening to the most ridiculous metal subgenres and trying to seem as &quot;evil&quot; as possible. The &quot;Satanic Bible&quot; is a poorly written take on Ayn Rand&#39;s objectivism, and they charge $200 to apply for membership. APPLY. And it&#39;s nonrefundable, even if you get turned down. </p>

<p>My Kindle is about to die, but I was able to see the first picture, and I&#39;m confused.  Red shoes?  Why is the picture with the hand gesture so blurry?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, Crowley&#39;s whole deal was some mystical shit called &quot;Thelema&quot;, which was based on a whole mess of things ranging from Egyptian mythology, to Eastern mysticism, to the Qabalah.   I think he was into yoga, too.   Weird fuckin&#39; dude. But it didn&#39;t have anything to do with Satanism; I think people tie Crowley to Satanism because his mom called him &quot;the Beast&quot;, and he just kinda stuck with it for whatever reason -- trying to understand that prick would give me an aneurysm.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s fair, however I wonder why he wouldn&#39;t have been just cropped out of the photo if its only purpose was to be a picture of Victoria that they would put on the news to garner sympathy and donations. With the old guy in the picture it&#39;s just a weirdly framed photo with a bizarre distraction in the background.

    <div class="md"><p>Personally, I don&#39;t see any good reason to crop someone out of a photo unless having them <em>in</em> the photo is bad (like an ex popping up in your old pictures).

    <div class="md"><p>Eh, I still think it seems really strange that they would leave that much extra crap in a photo of one little girl, but even disregarding that, this picture doesn&#39;t exist in a vacuum. In combination with the Church of Satan stuff and the other picture with the little girls, I don&#39;t think this can be a coincidence. Like I said, I don&#39;t know much about the Satanic stuff, but it definitely seems to me that this &quot;theme&quot; or imagery was subtly and deliberately inserted into this event.</p>

<p>Why? That I don&#39;t know. Maybe just to scare or confuse people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There seems to be a fundamental misunderstanding about what the Church of Satan is, and what they believe.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.churchofsatan.com/eleven-rules-of-earth.php">This</a> is directly from the source, and is word-for-word what is written in The Satanic Bible, which has been unaltered since the final edition was put out in either the &#39;60s or the &#39;70s.  I remember these, in this form, when I was a stupid kid trying to &quot;scare people&quot; with how &quot;fvcking \m/etal&quot; I was in high school, and rule 9, plain as day, says &quot;Do not harm little children.&quot; That rule is absent from both the Old and New Testaments, and keep in mind the fact that rampant sexual abuse of children at the hands of priests and pastors has been proven <em>multiple times</em> by <em>multiple people</em> in <em>countries all over the world</em>, whereas child abuse at the hands of members of the scamfest that is the Church of Satan has occurred a grand total of <em>absolutely none</em> times. </p>

<p>Nobody is scared or confused by the hand gesture.   Gene Simmons popularized it as part of one of the biggest rock bands of all time, and it&#39;s used by fans of the Texas Longhorns.   Like I said, tons of people in Texas, the Longhorns are their main team, and college football is a way of life.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting stuff. If I&#39;m misunderstanding that hand symbol, I&#39;m not the only one. The <a href="https://warningilluminati.wordpress.com/hands-signs-signs-of-satan/">horned hand</a> is commonly known as a Satanic gesture, whether or not it originally meant that. I&#39;m not theorizing that real Satanists (if such a thing exists) were the ones who did Sandy Hook. I&#39;m just saying, the imagery seems present in the case and it can only be intentional.  It was heavily used in the Bataclan &quot;massacre&quot; as well, which allegedly took place while the band (Eagles of Death Metal) was singing a song called &quot;Kiss The Devil.&quot; Many people in the audience were photoshopped doing that same hand symbol. Of course it&#39;s something people do at rock concerts, but the Satanic theme is being applied in a way that can only be purposeful.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t focus on this aspect of Sandy Hook by the way, it&#39;s just a creepy little side avenue I went down with it one night.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, let&#39;s take this one thing at a time: </p>

<ul>
<li><p>Your source is a wordpress site that warns of the Illuminati, a group that is rumored to still exist, but concrete evidence doesn&#39;t.   <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sign_of_the_horns#Heavy_metal_culture">My</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hook_%27em_Horns">sources</a> are a little more reputable, and I think Wikipedia has less of an agenda than &quot;warningilluminati&quot; on Wordpress.  </p></li>
<li><p>The Bataclan massacre occurred during a concert.  A rock concert.   Attended by fans of rock who <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sign_of_the_horns#Contemporary_use_by_musicians_and_fans">are well-known for using the gesture</a>.  Additionally, the fact that the band was playing a song called &quot;Kiss the Devil&quot; makes it all the more likely that the concertgoers would display the gesture, given its vague resemblance to the devil&#39;s head.  </p></li>
</ul>

<p>I&#39;m not sure how you&#39;re defining &quot;purposeful&quot; here; the gesture was used by an anonymous old man in one picture, and again at a rock concert where an unrelated shooting occurred.  I struggle to see how a gesture used by hundreds of millions of fans of rock music, as well as the tens (maybe hundreds, fuck if I know) of thousands of fans of a football team could be seen as &quot;creepy&quot;.</p>
</div>

    <div class="md"><p>The hand gesture being widely known as a Satanic sign is just common knowledge. Just Google &quot;Satanic hand sign&quot; and you will see it pop up many times. In fact it&#39;s the most common image that results from that search.</p>

<p>If the only instance of this occurring during Sandy Hook or otherwise were this one photo of an old man in the background, I and probably anyone else wouldn&#39;t think twice about it.  But the fact that it was intentionally photoshopped into an image of little girls makes it impossible to ignore. Again, it&#39;s no anomaly that it would be used and used a lot at a rock concert, especially during a devilish song. But the fact that it was intentionally photoshopped into that photo makes it, again, impossible to ignore. Minor details of perhaps no significance, but not just coincidences. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s <em>not</em> common knowledge.   It&#39;s widely used as a silent way of saying &quot;rock on&quot;.   If you can claim that it&#39;s widely known as a Satanic sign instead of a sign that says &quot;I dig power chords and leather jackets&quot;, by all means, please do so.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In fact it&#39;s the most common image that results from that search.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Okay, then.  Here are some other things to Google: </p>

<ul>
<li>&quot;Rock on symbol&quot;: <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=rock+on+symbol&amp;amp;source=lnms&amp;amp;tbm=isch&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;sqi=2&amp;amp;ved=0ahUKEwidutbr8PDSAhVB1oMKHfMUCmcQ_AUIBigB&amp;amp;biw=1600&amp;amp;bih=770">https://www.google.com/search?q=rock+on+symbol&amp;amp;source=lnms&amp;amp;tbm=isch&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;sqi=2&amp;amp;ved=0ahUKEwidutbr8PDSAhVB1oMKHfMUCmcQ_AUIBigB&amp;amp;biw=1600&amp;amp;bih=770</a> -- well, shit, looks like people use that to say &quot;rock on&quot;.<br/></li>
</ul>

<p>Let&#39;s look at something else.</p>

<ul>
<li>&quot;Hook em horns&quot; gives us <a href="http://a.fssta.com/content/dam/fsdigital/fscom/ncaa-fb/images/2014/10/09/100914-CFB-Texas-Longhorns-fans-celebrate-PI.vresize.1200.675.high.62.jpg">this</a> picture in particular.  Looks more like hundreds of football fans than Satanic baby-killers to me, but I&#39;m not the authority on who likes sports and who likes murdering children.<br/></li>
</ul>

<p>If you have proof that it was intentionally photoshopped, would you be willing to share that source with me?  I trust that the original, unadulterated image exists, and has been proven as such.</p>

<p>Edit: since your comment disappeared, let me attempt to respond as best I can.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Walk up to any person on the street and tell them to make a Satanic sign with their hands and probably at least 7/10 people will do that thing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Counterpoint, ask them to do the &quot;rock on&quot; gesture and I&#39;ll bet they all do it.  So much for that.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Or don&#39;t do that, because I already proved it was common knowledge with the fact that it results in abundance on a Google image search for &quot;Satanic hand gesture.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And you get even more results when you Google &quot;rock on symbol&quot; and &quot;hook em horns&quot; gesture, so not only can I provide <em>more</em> image results <em>per search</em>, I can also provide <em>twice as many</em> queries to search for that give results for the gesture.   So there goes that one.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The photos are obviously photoshopped. The girl has no legs. I&#39;m not a photoshop expert and even I can tell there are elements with that and other photos from Sandy Hook and the Parker family specifically that are not right. Of course, people who are photoshop experts have pointed out the same thing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They&#39;re not photoshopped.  Claims that are made without evidence can be dismissed without evidence.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Your having esoteric knowledge about Satanism from being an edgy teenager doesn&#39;t override the common perception that people have about that hand sign, which I even knew about before Sandy Hook even happened.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Actually, I&#39;ve got multiple sources that back up my claim, and all you&#39;ve given me was a wordpress page.   By your own admission, you &quot;don&#39;t know much about the Satanic stuff&quot; and suggested it was possible that you&#39;re &quot;misunderstanding that hand symbol&quot;, and admitted that you &quot;don&#39;t know why&quot; the old man&#39;s in the picture.  That&#39;s not &quot;esoteric knowledge&quot;.  That&#39;s concrete knowledge of the &quot;rules&quot; of a scam masquerading as a religion, the history of the popular gesture associated with rock and roll, and the identical gesture used by a massively popular sports team.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I don&#39;t know what point you&#39;re making. That 20 children were actually shot by Adam Lanza, because that hand sign is also a rock and roll sign? Frankly you&#39;re boring me.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The point I&#39;m making is that you&#39;re continuing to insult me and provide no evidence to back up your claims while I&#39;m finding multiple legitimate sources to try and help you understand something that, by your own admission, you&#39;re misunderstanding.  Why would a bunch of scam artists in Halloween costumes shoot up a bunch of kids, when they paid $200 to say &quot;I believe in the teachings of this book that clearly states &#39;Do not harm little children&#39;&quot;.  That makes as much sense as the claim that the victims of the shooting were Satanists who... wait, did the shooting?   Were killed because they were Satanists?   What were you trying to claim there?</p>

<p>I went even further down the rabbit hole than I what I initially reported here... But once I start probing into the National Guard&#39;s potential involvement I take a deep breath and two steps back. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nah... I just backed off cause I was getting a little too deep and was ending up with more loose ends than I could keep track of... The National Guard stuff was getting a little weird... and I don&#39;t exactly like looking into conspiracies in the town I live in... thats how ya end up getting real &quot;depressed&quot; real quick... Luckily both my main harddrive <em>and</em> my backup harddrive  suffered from simultaneous instantaneous  catastrophic failures... so I took that as a hint that maybe I should just forget about the whole thing.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I try to stay impartial... in my 9/10 post I was certainly holding the FBI responsible for covering up and intimidation... but I know they are a huge organization that was up to a lot of shiesty shit in the past... but also they do a fuckton of good... and in this huge shitshow going on right now... I think they are the ones that are gonna be able to &quot;lay down the law&quot; and really help get stuff cleaned up. They have no qualms about going after their own... it&#39;s just they were tied up by a lot of redtape in the past... if we are to have any hope of cleaning up the horseshit in America it falls firmly on the shoulders of the FBI and daddy DOJ... cause the FBI are the only ones out there doing shit by the book... the FBI can make stuff stick, cause they will come correct with documentation. </p>

<p>Comey laid it all out in this speech to law enforcement... Despite how many negative stories you get rammed down your throat by the media... and there are legit bad stories... people often don&#39;t see the good. That speech is a great read. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Police officers are overwhelmingly good people. They are overwhelmingly people who took exhausting, dangerous jobs because they want to help people. They chose lives of service over self, lives of moral content, because that’s who they are. They want to stop bad guys from occupying neighborhoods; they want to help old people off the floor and back into bed; they want to keep a young girl from a life on the street.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A good read. We are certainly caught in riptides... I come from a town with atrocious police abuses. I was hassled constantly for no discernible reason for years until I moved a few times.</p>

<p>I used to hate cops with everything inside, but that was fifteen years ago. Now I realize it was just that town. Every officer I&#39;ve met since then has turned my perception around. There are certain rotten departments that do nothing but line their own pockets and contribute to resentment against LEO&#39;s.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I learned at a young age that some cops are good and some are bad... our entire town PD was purged and replaced by new ones cause the old PD had a huge fundraiser to get money for night/heat vision goggles under the premise of helping find people trapped in burning buildings or some shit... turns out they took like $35k from the townsfolk and used the goggles exclusively for jacking deer... on duty... instead of policing they were poaching and butchering on the night shift. </p>

But it didn&#39;t have anything to do with Satanism; I think people tie Crowley to Satanism because his mom called him &quot;the Beast&quot;, and he just kinda stuck with it for whatever reason -- trying to understand that prick would give me an aneurysm.  </p>
