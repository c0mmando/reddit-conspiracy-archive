    <div class="md"><p>Absolutely this. Alex Jones is no finer example of controlled opposition and how limited hangouts, how the blend of truth and lies, can create effective disinformation. The only reason for this behavior from Jones and Infowars, out of the decades of conspiracy theories they have propagated, is because this is a <em>real</em> story that got out of control, and now they&#39;re trying to put a lid on it. I&#39;ve never seen Alex Jones back down from anything like he has backed down from this story. It is incredibly telling of his motives and his purpose. Especially this happening right now when CNN is running stories like <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2017/03/24/us/missing-black-girls-washington-dc/index.html">this</a>.</p>

<p>I unsubscribed from his Youtube channel, I unfollowed him and Infowars on social media. I always knew he was full of shit, though I entertained him because it&#39;s good to know where everyone is coming from in regards to opinions or beliefs and a lot of people listen to and trust Jones, but I&#39;m not going to entertain him or his propaganda anymore. Fuck Alex Jones.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I watch virtually every media outlet available, from the networks and cable news outlets, to BBC, TYT, RT, INFOWARS, Al Jazeera, etc. I like to know where everyone&#39;s opinions are coming from. I&#39;ve unsubscribed from Infowars. I watched him to get an understanding of what his viewers think but I can&#39;t do it anymore. He&#39;s a bullshit artist, a liar, a fraud. I won&#39;t give him Youtube hits, I won&#39;t give him ad revenue.</p>

<p>William Cooper in <em>Behold a Pale Horse</em> talked about how there is a traitor in the patriot movement. I firmly believe that traitor is Alex Jones. Cooper described it as an operation that collected names, addresses, financial information, everything on patriots, conspiracy theorists, political dissenters, and so on. Aside from disseminating disinformation, Alex Jones also amasses massive amounts of data on those who use his sites, buy his products, and sign up for all of his gimmicks and giveaways and newsletters. People willingly tell Alex Jones everything they think on Facebook, Twitter, and so on. I am 100% sure that Alex Jones is controlled opposition.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Despite him discounting pizzagate specifically he&#39;s been talking about gov. pedophilia (even &quot;gating&quot; it) the whole time tho, am I not remembering this correct?  I swear to god he mentions it in some form on his show most of the time when I occasionally decide to ride the daily meme train for a bit.</p>

<p>imo he&#39;s intentionally low signal to noise ratio, and he&#39;s developed a mastery of memetics and memetic propaganda that probably started intuitively(accidentally) and was developed over time—a bit of truth in every absurdist statement, frogs are gay, etc. can transfer info propagation of ideas that spread by a trojan horse of humor/memes.  I think most people would&#39;ve laughed at this a few years ago but its why the CIA was propositioning a fucking Meme Warfare Department.</p>

<p>To me he&#39;s perfected infotainment (in a less derrogatory sense of the term) but I can see why people are iffy on him though. His manifestation as Bizarro World MSM, while kind of beautiful in some ironic way, isn&#39;t the best optics for someone in the fifth estate—especially when you&#39;re spearheaded by a guy selling fucking water filters and SUPER MALE VITALITY pills with him shirtless on the ads lmao</p>

<p>moments of clarity, also obvious moments of garbage, overall chaotic good/10</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Infowars was informed a long time ago about all this disinformation regarding pizzagate and who exactly was spreading it.  Instead of covering it or calling people out, they interviewed one of the primary players in the disinfo campaign: <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagateshills/1564027">Brittany Pettibone</a></p>

<p>When did it become OK for media outlets to interview people who just forward anything and everything on twitter without doing any actual research into the validy of the information?</p>

<p>It is ridiculous, and it is only happening because it is part of a major operation (involving the alt-right &amp; the Russia narrative).</p>

<p>jones seems like he&#39;s distancing himself from the game.  he&#39;s probably trying to <em>retire.</em></p>

<p>another interesting thing i would notice in his news vids was guns or even the face book finger on the screens in the background aligned with his head as if &quot;he has a gun to his head.&quot;  of course i cant comment on the actual meaning as to whether its a cry for help or whatever, but thought it was interesting.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>William &quot;Bill&quot; Cooper was ONI, he came forward in the 1980s about a government conspiracy involving aliens, UFOs, etc. He said that while working in intelligence, he came across documents pertaining to a program called &quot;Majestic&quot; that dealt with extraterrestrials and their technology and a plan to use that to help institute a world government. It wasn&#39;t until after he left the government that he began to put the pieces of everything he was privy to together. He traveled around the country, giving lectures on the subject. He published a book on the topic called <em>Behold a Pale Horse</em>. Cooper also had a very successful radio show, <em>The Hour of the Time</em>. But then, Cooper began to recant the UFO narrative. He said that the UFO thing was fed to him, that we do have aircraft that we call UFOs, but they are not from aliens. He said that everything he saw about aliens, about &quot;Majestic,&quot; was fed to him so that he could be a mouthpiece for disinformation. He believed that perhaps what really was happening is that the government wanted people to believe in aliens and UFOs because not only does it make a good smokescreen, a way of obfuscating secret projects and weapons tests, but also because the elite wanted to fake an alien invasion, or alien encounter, as a way of instituting global government.</p>

<p>In other words, Cooper focused not on aliens, not on the sort&#39;ve stuff Alex Jones covers, but instead he covered the occult origins and secret knowledge of the elites. He wasn&#39;t a raving idiot, he didn&#39;t have tantrums on air, he was a calm, collected, well spoken, well read man. He also predicted 9/11 and Bin Laden&#39;s involvement months before it happened. I&#39;ll post links to all of this stuff at the end.</p>

<p>Cooper&#39;s big thing toward the end of his life was going around to get average folks to create their own community radio networks, free of influence from the corporations, where people can control the news they hear, the music they hear, etc. </p>

<p>Cooper ran into trouble during the Clinton administration when he allegedly wasn&#39;t paying his federal income tax. Cooper had argued that there was no legal requirement to pay it.</p>

<p>Cooper spoke a lot about the attempts on his life. He was ran off the road and lost a leg, in fact. One day some people were partying in a pick-up truck at the end of his driveway, a long gravel road. Cooper drove down to the end of the driveway in his truck to ask them to go away. Upon approach, he noticed they weren&#39;t kids, but rather they were all adults. Thinking something was fishy, Cooper quickly backed up his truck and turned around. Out of nowhere, cops swarmed his truck. Cooper nearly ran over one of them trying to flee back to his house. As the story goes, from the police, as Cooper was exiting his truck and running to his front door, he pulled a gun and began firing over his shoulder at the police, supposedly hitting one officer. The police returned fire and gunned him down on his front steps.</p>

<p>It is my opinion that Bill Cooper was the real deal. The reason he is dead is because he didn&#39;t play the game. He wasn&#39;t going to be COINTELPRO, he wasn&#39;t going to be disinformation. He told people not to take his word for anything, he told them to go out and research everything he said for themselves. He would give people the intelligence he had so we could get a full picture of where his opinions and beliefs were coming from. He was the antithesis of Alex Jones.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The best way to beat the opposition, is to control them</p>

<p>I have profound respect for all the work Alex Jones has done.... but I truely believe he was compromised.</p>

<p>If i was a nefarious organization (like the CIA) and we had an Alex Jones man constantly calling attention to me, I wouldnt kill him. I would slowly drive him to insanity, and give him a microphone while I am doing it. Perhaps &quot;they&quot; put psychotics in his water. Perhaps being involved in the world you are in and having no one listen to you for years will drive you to madness....</p>

<p>Either or, its clear he is insane now. Its clear that he supports &quot;the establishment&quot;..... and he still has that microphone.</p>
