       Mostly: I don't trust their space program (from the 60s-70s), but the ISS is like the crowning achievement of our time...also memory foam mattress are sweet...when their technological advancements enter the market it's great but who knows what they're hiding...

       You might want to sit down for this, but the ISS is another scam. Do you think NASA just started being a legitimate space program all of a sudden and actually, you know, doing stuff in space instead of faking it?

       You can't have bubbles in space. The videos from ISIS are in some ways more preposterous and goofy than the ones from the
       <del>

       </del>
       film studio, and that's saying something.

       Even if you think the ISS is real, it's far from the "crowning achievement" of anything.... pointless, vague experiments that provide no benefit to anyone whatsoever? Being performed unnecessarily in zero-g in a tin can that orbits 200 miles above earth? What's so great about that again?

       Everyone always says that. First of all, I'd like to see one good picture of it. Secondly, my argument is
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       that there is nothing up there orbiting where they say it is. I'm willing to be convinced either way. My point is that the videos that emerge from it are obviously staged and so goofy and ridiculous that the people filming them have to be laughing at us. Not to mention the concept of putting ten or twelve people in a sealed tube for virtually no reason when some of them even have children on earth and could be killed in a catastrophic accident at any second (not that anything bad ever happens up there of course) is preposterous on its face.

       I was in an airplane a couple days ago, my point is that a photo taken from 200 miles above earth should look different from one taken from 8 miles altitude, but this looks just like it was taken from a plane.

       a) her hair would behave like it was actually experiencing weightlessness, flowing and billowing uncontrollably in every direction much like that of
       <a href="http://cdn-s3.si.com/s3fs-public/images/op44-75201-raw1200_0.JPG">
        Kate Upton
       </a>
       here. Keep in mind Ms. Upton is doing this for a photo shoot so her hair is definitely covered in hairspray, yet it's still billowing like this. Compare that to the ISS bullshit and those women's hair just stiffly protrudes upwards like the bride of Frankenstein at all times.
      </p>
      <p>
       b.) It's a hoax. Whether it exists or not, the videos that emerge have signs of fakery and the entire concept of what they are doing up there is childishly stupid. You can see wires protruding from shirts, you can see bubbles in space coming out of helmets and parts of the craft, you can watch their interviews at fast speeds and realize that they are bouncing there on wires, some of them at the same rhythm, etc. There are many things about living in orbit with other people in a sealed container like that that would be huge problems but they are never addressed in an adequate way by NASA.
      </p>
      <p>
       c.) see a.) and b.) but I'd be happy to point you towards some instances of obvious fakery if you like.

       I always ask people why can't they just turn the Hubble telescope toward the moon and take an amazing picture of the Apollo landing sites? To which they respond with a bunch of pre-packaged bilge about focal lengths and resolving power..... which, even if you buy it, begs the question: are there
       <em>
        no

       telescopes on heaven or on earth that can take a picture of the American flag, still up there, still flapping triumphantly in the moon's breeze?

       In fact I only have a rudimentary understanding of telescopes. Of course if we really went to the moon there would be third party verification by now. The idea that we sent men there like ten time, about 50 years ago, to play golf and bounce around, but now no one can send a rover or camera to take a high quality photograph that corroborates NASA's story, is so preposterous that only a completely credulous simpleton could accept it.

       What I don't understand about this is don't you think that China and Russia would be investing vast amounts of capital in disproving the moon landings if they had
       <em>
        any
       </em>
       reason to think they didn't happen? Nobody has landed rovers there because a) it's a big moon and we want to see as much of it as possible, so it's sort of a waste to keep going to the same spot, and b) nobody (who matters) thinks the story needs corroboration.

       Unfortunately Russia and China are both involved in the modern space station hoaxing, where you can see air bubbles on some of the Chinese space walks and the Russians are at least sometimes part of the ISS b.s.
      </p>
      <p>
       Both the US and Russia have expressed desires to return to the moon meaning there are real reasons to go there other than to verify the story, which should be no problem after 50 years of technological development.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for your last point it's just simply incorrect. Sure no establishment scientists are vocal about the moon landing hoax because they would lose their statuses and jobs. There are plenty of highly intelligent people who are the ones debunking the hoax in the first place. It's basically common knowledge in Russia and Eastern Europe that we didn't really go. If you go to aulis.com you will find paper after paper of mathematical, physical, and visual proof that we never went written by PhD's and professionals from all sorts of fields. Just because the Mythbusters and Neil deGrasse Tyson say we went doesn't mean people much more qualified than them are not aware it was a hoax.

       because they said they sent people to the MOON in 1969, a mere 11 years after their inception, with a computer that wasn't even functional using a space ship made of cardboard and gold foil, after not one of the astronuts could successfully land the lander prototype a single time on earth, lost the footage, and then provided pieces of petrified wood as proof.

       And no one has gone within 230,000 miles of the moon ever since... No I do not trust No Actual Scientists Allowed. I would not trust them in a house; I would not trust them with a mouse.

        Technique #4 - 'INFORMATION COLLECTION'
       </p>
       <p>
        Information collection is also a very effective method to determine the psychological level of the forum members, and to gather intelligence that can be used against them. In this technique in a light and positive environment a 'show you mine so me yours' posting is initiated. From the number of replies and the answers that are provided much statistical information can be gathered. An example is to post your 'favourite weapon' and then encourage other members of the forum to showcase what they have. In this matter it can be determined by reverse proration what percentage of the forum community owns a firearm, and or a illegal weapon. This same method can be used by posing as one of the form members and posting your favourite 'technique of operation.' From the replies various methods that the group utilizes can be studied and effective methods developed to stop them from their activities.
