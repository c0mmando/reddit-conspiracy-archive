       I am posting this again to catch more eyes and raise awareness. This needs to have light shined on it and dealt with.

       I'll update this as we get more information. This is dark and hard to deal with but please we need to come together and unite against this problem. We cannot expand or evolve if we are still diddling and hurting our own children. The same children that will eventually inherit this earth. We need to end this and treat this problem, whatever that may be.
      </p>
      <p>
       Please share, archive, research, and stay safe and stay positive. Meditation and deep breaths help to bring yourself back into balance after looking at these types of things.

       Finally you redditors caught up.
      </p>
      <p>
       Been doing research off of [rule #1] and I've noticed that the user "young" has more or less softcore cp.
      </p>
      <p>
       The users can post pictures so check their albums. On each picture another user can comment. Read these comments and catalog the amount of overlap between users. You can access a list of the tribes they are members of and a list of their friends. I've found that by using "young" as a starting point I can find a reliable group of roughly 5 or 6 sick pervs who are strongly connected.
      </p>
      <p>
       This may be a deep state operation to 'crowdsource' child trafficking victims. That's one of my theories, anyways.
      </p>
      <p>
       The site is shitty so it will give a 503 often, just refresh.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've gone through most of user "sofia". Nothing spectacular, closest thing to normal I've seen in that hellhole. I know that a few of aforementioned strongly connected users are also connected to her through the friends list.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hope this gives some of you a better idea of where to start!

       Baby rape? It's so inconceivable all I can think of is an ancient 4chan meme involving a bad translation of a manga.
      </p>
      <p>
       Baby snuff, murdering an infant for gratification, sexual or otherwise, is just beyond belief for me.
      </p>
      <p>
       as someone who has seen the most grotesque, perverted disgusting, taboo and evil acts of mankind, I still have trouble believing this is real, I'm sure there are sick fucks up to this but so common and so brazen? no, I tell myself it must be some government trying to get information and pretending to blend in.

       Jesus fucking christ. Can you imagine how many children have been tortured and murdered at the hands of these monsters? Really makes me understand why parents who have their kids disappear cannot ever live again. I'd rather know my child was dead than to imagine something like this happen to them. Fucking hell. Evil, evil motherfuckers.

       If you're anxious for anonymity, the printer fingerprinting applies to COLOUR printers as it's only Yellow that's used.  Make a black and white photocopy and it's gone.  It's to prevent banknote forgery, which was a concern when colour printers first appeared for consumer prices.

       Here's to hoping this is a trap. Otherwise, this could be argued to be 1st amendment protected free speech, as sick as it is. If they are only talking about ideas and asking if others have similar fantasies, but not actually insinuating that another human being is currently in danger of abuse, this is very gray area stuff.

       What I would be curious to see/read are transcripts from private chats and/or video chats.

       Don't mean to derail the specific topic here but this lends more credence to the theory that some people are literally not human. Reinforces my suspicion that aliens are truly among us because human beings with innate moral compasses would never want to do what these 'things' fantasize over.

       I truly love and appreciate how this community, contrary to popular belief, actively fights against injustice and takes a stand against disgusting and depraved shit when most don't. Many may see this subreddit as a place for crazy people, but we need to stay here, expand and stand together to help rid the world of disgusting cretins like the ones shown in this post and many others.

       Sounds like a bunch of /b/tards to me. Did you not know that the joke about 4chan is that it harbors pedos? "Cheese pizza" CP stands for child porn... this is why it's hilarious that you guys buy the pizzagate thing. It's a troll by the masters of trolling, who also happens to all be pedo apologists!

       Probably a bot that is spamming the site. Or just trolls. I can't imagine a large number of people would actually be this stupid to do this shit on the surface web,

       Managed to find details of the registrar of the tribe website. Been working there since 2008, and on her profile is the tagline "This is where we fix Tribe.net" Yes, I'm sure you are fixing it very well, you disgusting excuse for a human.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: The company who has been in charge of "fixing" the site since 2008 is called
       <br/>
       New Systems Associates which is "an LLC formed by long-time Tribe members who believe in protecting and expanding Tribe's unique culture."
      </p>

       Some more info on the owners:

       Not to defend these sick freaks, but as far as we know these are only sick fantasies. There's no proof anything is happening. I for one, am not comfortable policing free speech on the internet no matter how perverted it is.

       I stopped scrolling when I spotted that one poster's avatar/profile picture featuring a young boy with his legs spread apart. Couldn't tell if he was wearing underwear or not, but that doesn't really matter. Forcing a child to pose in highly sexual and suggestive positions, clothed or not, is still sick.

       I think a pederast is a man that likes small boys. Hephebeophile is someone that likes 11-14 and an ephebeophile someone who likes 15-18. I'm not completely sure and my spellings are probably wrong.  Obviously the younger the child is the worse it is. Pedophiles should be castrated or euthanised. Not sure what should happen to Hephebeophiles. But I think ephebeophiles should be locked up just like today if the girl is under 16

       I googled the one that ended in 1948. There was a chaturbate user with that same username who was 68 and interested in men. He also follows many others on there. Also was a Twitter handle with same name.

       It's definitely interesting but we have no way of knowing if it's the same people so I won't link it. Last thing anyone should do is go on a witch hunt and accusing them.

       What, really?  Nobody here trusts the MSM.  You have to go outside of it to win ANY arguments on r/conspiracy.  Even Trump-Russia complaints should be investigated without reference to the MSM if you want to make headway on this forum.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your real complaint should have been that the comment you replied to was useless, because nobody here buys anything because of it being an MSM claim.  It was just reinforcing the status quo of the forum, and would have been empty noise if it hadn't revealed that it is a status quo of which you are evidently unaware.

       Ritual sacrifice only shows up in the most extremely hierarchical societies.  One of the basic principles of extreme hierarchical societies is that lessers
       <em>
        belong
       </em>
       to their greaters.  Children belong to their parents in such societies - otherwise, they could not be ritually disposed of.  While established only by circumstantial evidence in this case, it's extremely probable that they abused the fuck out of everyone vulnerable.  It's a pattern which has been observed in human cultures.

       <em>
        be
       </em>
       your hatred, and don't be controlled by it.  You'll do fine.

       Karma nor the devil exist. They're childhood myths taught to make you think something bigger is out there.

       I have known way too many horrible people that prosper from their actions with zero repercussions.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is the way of the world. 
Hoping on karma or a mythical creature in a mythical afterlife is childish.

       Well, historically "God" is responsible for more evil than anything.
      </p>
      <p>
       If anything, humanity is maturing. Violent crime is down, sex crimes are down, life expectancy is up, humanity is generally trending towards the positive. The news would lead you to believe otherwise, but the hard numbers don't lie.
      </p>
      <p>
       And it's no coincidence that religion as a whole is losing support as people are more capable of learning. Eventually, the god myth will be looked at the same way we view vampires and goblins. Interesting stories, but only a crazy person would actually believe them.

       Isn't agnostic atheist an oxymoron? I thought that Agnostics believe in an unknown greater power atheists believe there is no higher power.  Edit: Thank you to everyone who took the time to talk about this. I feel like I have a better grasp on this now :). Not an oxymoron just a bunch of misunderstood definitions and experiences.

       So weird to see supposed skeptics putting faith in fairy tales en masse. I remember when conspiracists were hostile to fantasies of mass delusion not some weird new age belief in a battle between ultimate evil beings and beings of purity and light. Very strange times we live in.

       Haven't read much about MK Ultra but have heard parts of it. Inducing seperate personalities into test subjects was one of the things that happened, essentially turning someone into a vehicle with multiple pilots with varying triggers for them getting into the pilot controls and taking control of the body so to speak.

       Wouldn't surprise me if they were just careless about being caught. I'd imagine there'd be a rush for them to think they could get caught, mix in some people who are too stupid to take precautions about getting caught and you have a potential mixing bag of pervs and sickos.

       Yep. Better to build a case that you know will for sure bring down an entire network of these sickos than just attempt to try one person and potentially fail to convict them.

       I also am sure they are apprehensive to reveal their capabilities as not to encourage people to find ways to counter them. The enemy will eventually adapt to your tactics the more you use them.

       Obviously sexual attraction to kids is a disease. It is a sickness, much like autism or bipolar disorder. I don't think by any means that that rids them of guilt or fault in any way, but they're so heavily stigmatized (with good reason) that they wouldn't dare see a therapist or seek help. So they either bottle it and eventually act on these desires, or maybe they share some disgusting fantasy and it helps them refrain from acting it out.

       Most of these people will just be making it up as part of some twisted fantasy, while jerking themselves off in their room alone. I highly doubt that any more than a tiny percentage of the stuff written there is even close to being true.

       If you're anxious for anonymity, the printer fingerprinting applies to COLOUR printers as it's only Yellow that's used.  Make a black and white photocopy and it's gone.  It's to prevent banknote forgery, which was a concern when colour printers first appeared for consumer prices.

       Not trying to be that guy, but I honestly wouldn't bet on it being fake. Obviously NSFL, but videos like Daisys Disaster (don't look into it, if you want to have a shitty week) have been sold world wide for hundreds to thousands of dollars. Snuff films on infants (which I fucking absolutely hasn't no idea why) are a thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then you have people like Ian Watkins (famous Welsh singer) who actually coherced a mother into letting him rape her infant baby. Plus a list of other fucked up shit. Don't read into him or the infamous court transcripts if you want to lose more faith inhumanity.

       Cut out letters from magazines stolen from local hair salons and individually glue them onto a piece of white paper in the same order as the evidence.

       What do you think of priests that cast out demons? Not the southern Baptists ones in church but ones that are called by families say when they move into a new house. Granted these can't technically be confirmed. most seem to cast these negative entities out using Jesus. Wondering if you think he holds some power.

       I recommend this book here often hehe, so here goes. "Dispelling Wetiko: Breaking the Curse of Evil" by Paul Levy has been a tremendous source of understanding, support, and sanity to me when I became aware of the amount of darkness in the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       Though fate, or simply luck I discovered this book right around the time I really began getting red pilled a few years ago. I've read it cover to cover a handful of times since then, and often find myself reading parts here and there when I start to feel the slightest twinge of hopelessness settling in. So, lately especially.
      </p>
      <p>
       He breaks down how evil works from a sort of spiritual/metaphysical (not new age at all though) yet rational perspective, and what we can do collectively as well as individually to push against and neutralize evil's power. Especially relevant to the topic of PG, really, I can't think of anything worse or more evil than harming children. Just thought I'd mention it as a positive resource, as hope can seem rather elusive and short supply lately.

       When the pedogate stuff was first coming out, I realized (or rather started to believe) that Satan, or some evil entity or force exists in the world. Made me sick and I had to start believing in God or some force of good, or else I'd go insane dealing with the fucked up shit and knowing there's no retribution or even opposite force.

       Is this true? If so that is a bit overkill...even kids stumble upon fucked up shit while browsing the internet..I mean(not an illegal situation but still) when I was young and on a Dragonball Z site it flipped me around onto a fucking Hentai site and that was not my intention when I was that young.

       There is no evidence that they are born pedo. Biology factors in procreative sexual deviance/pliability, but like paedophilia, people simply aren't born wanting to be punched in the face or to suck toes. I don't mean to suggest that sexual preference is changeable or indicative of moral character--I agree with you that anti-abuse pedo support communities promote public well being and safety. I have some sympathy to the pain and loneliness of non-offending pedos.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not meant to be nitpicky or combative (: I'm just peeved by U.S./West's "born this way" mythology--many in the LGBTQ community have started to dismiss/divert attention from it for the reasons stated above too.

       Gnosticism = Lucifer worship.  It's warned about repeatedly in the Bible.  I honestly don't understand how some people can discover that all of the elites worship Satan and then proceed to reject God/Jesus.  I guess they are all just retarded and Satan doesn't exist though (lol).
      </p>

       I also find it amusing that people think they are "enlightened" because they read a website about aliens yet they've never even picked up a Bible or done any studying.  Sign of the times I suppose.

       Russia and Trump or if Obama spied on Trump are huge deals. National security and/or executive over reach? On what planet are these considered distractions? Even if either party is lying about their accusations then it still a big deal. 
You think these things are resolved over night? We live in a bureaucratic democracy not a dictatorship. This is the slow drip of the law.

       There appears to be a pattern whenever TPTB what us to accept something new.  A sitcom will introduce a side character, that has some bizarre quality.  Everyone laughs, becomes comfortable with the topic, then soon there will be an entire show based on this bizarre quality.  By this time, viewers have been programmed to accept this as normal.  Integration and homosexuality are major examples.  As of late, we have been hit hard with vampires and zombies.  It will be interesting to see how it all plays out.

       The real Miley Cyrus is dead, that drug riddled slut screaming on your screen is her clone (or one of them). Original got wiped out when she went full Brittney and stopped taking the Disney drugs. Cue in hair chopped off, pizza and ayyyy loving Miley on a wrecking ball of molly. New Miley doesnt even look like the original lol, different hair color, nose, jaw, eyes, and missing moles. You can find youtube videos of her Hannah Montana concert days where they swap in like 4 different "Miley's" during costume changes.

       Happens to every musician who is killed off or cloned. Drug problems&gt;rehab&gt;come out looking completely different. Most recently, kanye hops out the asylum with no entourage pickup party, freshly bleached hair, and looking nothing like Kanye. "Dont kill me Jay"

Freedom of speech only goes so far. I can't wave around a gun and say I'm going to shoot someone, and doing so online would likely result in some FBI agents at my door.

       Yeah, our media in the US keeps everyone focused on meaningless shit like if ivanka trump went to a meeting or trump spent time at some stupid resort he owns. Where are all investigative journalists that used to chase leads down to expose this kind of shi- they're too busy filming protesters hitting each other w flag poles and pepper spray.

       1- Okay, I haven't read this shit because I really don't want to... but from what I've gathered from other comments, these creeps are merely writing out fantasies. And while we may find their fantasies to be despicable and disgusting, that actually does not make them illegal. I could write stories about robbing banks and assassinating people all day long. As long as I don't actually do those things, I've committed no crime.
      </p>
      <p>
       2- If pedophilia is a thing that we don't know how to fix yet, I would much rather have a pedophile sitting in his own home fantasizing and jerking off, than going out and actually harming a child.
      </p>
      <p>
       3- That said, we also can't pick and choose which types of speech we find acceptable. Because there will always be
       <em>
        someone
       </em>
       out there who doesn't like what you have to say, and would want to stop you from saying it. First pedos, and no one cares, then racists, and most of us don't care... and then what? What if someone thinks you shouldn't be able to talk about religion, or atheism, or certain types of politics?
      </p>
      <p>
       It's much better if you and I can say whatever we want, and we just don't have to listen to each other if we don't like it. Free to speak, and free to listen or ignore as we see fit. Just like I'm not going to go to some pedo website and read their creepy stories, because I find them gross and objectionable. Fortunately for me, I don't need to read them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now law enforcement could still look into these people, and bust anyone who's comitted an actual crime. But doxxing only leads to vigilante bullshit. And doxxers don't always get the right info. So if anyone does any doxxing, I strongly recommend turning the info over to the authorities, rather than publishing it online. But that's just me.

       the pics in this thread is cleaned up text only, the original thread on 8chan exposing this had the actual screenshots with blurred out pictures(like the media would do reporting this) that shows this to clearly NOT be LARP. It was shared on this sub 2 days ago.

      <p>
       You are wrong in this and your many comments throughout this thread minimizing this as just fantasy is a detriment to the conversation and frankly, creepy.

       Look, they may still be creeps talking about creepy shit. But
       <em>
        a lot
       </em>
       of people online talk about sex they never had. People write sexual stories all the time and share them online.
       <strong>
        <em>
         Especially people who can't get laid in real life.
        </em>
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       (Not trying to say all writers of erotica are sexually frustrated virgins -- I'm just saying there are a lot of people who use writing as an outlet for sexual frustration.)
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd bet almost anything that 99% of these or higher are just gross fantasizing.
       <em>
        Most
       </em>
       actual criminals aren't dumb enough to write about their crimes in detail online. Most. The rest are kids, petty criminals, and morons. A lot of people may openly talk about growing pot, for example. Not a lot of people openly discuss the murders they've done. Whole other league.

       Sure thing. But even those of us who can have normal socially-acceptable fulfilling sex with other adults, sometimes write about fantasies online. Those people are out there -- I just don't think many of them would be bragging about their actual crimes on the clearnet. There

       Yup thats just one little part of it, child sacrifices have been around for at least 5,000 years, probably longer. They are kabbalist satanists, worship Lucifer, hate Jesus and they love black cubes and Saturn. I've never been a religious person but all this stuff has honestly made me pick up the bible and start reading.... Almost everything going on is in there in one way or another, crazy stuff.

       Deserving of the same treatment we'd doll out to a rabid animal. These sick fucks are beyond help and simply need to be removed. I am on the verge of vomiting even considering that another person is capable of doing this to a child, much less an infant. If something like this happened to my infant daughter it would completely snap me. I'd be a ruined shell of who I am now. I don't even know if I'd have anything left to attempt revenge or if I'd just kill myself. It's disgusting in every sense of the word. I'm gonna go hug my kids now.

       um, guys? It's literally
       <em>
        everywhere
       </em>
       , not "just" the "dark net". Like literally even here on Reddit and sites like imgur and especially certain boards on the chans, I have seen many, many comments from folks who've stumbled accidentally across such images or videos before the mods could get to it, or in the case of the chans(not necessarily 4chan, since as its' gotten rather mainstream the CP has diminished to a similar level as Reddit &amp; Imgur) the mods appear to turn their heads completely. This is nothing new. Further, there are porn sites which do the same thing - turn their heads to what, in most areas, would be considered hebephlic &amp; abusive at
       <em>
        least
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the tribe stuff: similar stories are found on all of the popular erotic lit websites. I am surprised by peoples' surprise, its as if its your first day on the internet or some such....?? Yes it's outrageous and gross and awful but it is nothing new. Yes, sick fucks exist. We know this. Have all you PGers you been living under a rock or what? Anywhere that people gather in large numbers &amp; have more or less an open forum to post whatever they wish, I guarantee you will find sick fucks congregating. Yes, even sites like FB, twitter, youtube are not 100% "safe"/without. Humans are sick. For real.

       If there are many culturally prescribed names these entities are described by that share across continents such similarity of character, intent and origin in the described mythologies what's wrong with adding:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Demons/fallen angels
       </li>
       <li>
        Djinn (the Islamic version of the above after all....)
       </li>
       <li>
        Archons

       <li>

       <li>
        Aliens/Extra-Terrestrial entities
       </li>
       <li>
        Paranormal entities
       </li>
       <li>
        Giant races both humanoid and animal which are obviously partly based in the subtrate of human and animal DNA respectively.
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Just a recurring thought I've been having a lot of late.
      </p>
      <p>
       A question for the US contributors - I notice there appears a high correlation between being a strong, some might say fundamentalist, I prefer strong or unwavering believer in a faith that is routinely attacked, denigrated and ridiculed that of Christianity (of which their are many interps, understandings and persuasions I realise) and being a consp. theorist, survivalist/prepper, sovereign individualist, Constitutionalist and overall to be often times very critical of and mistrustful of the govt., associated govt. alphabet agencies and the revolving door relationship between them and multinational/globalist corps.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do not state this as a provocation or indictment.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's simply something I am always reminded of often when talking CTs through the traps/channels and can see how it is a logical combination of themes esp I believe pertinent to the discussion of inter dimensional influences on the biological human form as the Bible obviously has it's own versions of these incredibly common mythological themes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Many of the above mentioned positions I have a lot of time for and just want to say in general props, hello, and take care to my CT brothers and sisters State side as your culture and society really seems to be going through it at pres. which I know is a long est. tradition historically in America but even I as a non-US based/outsider can feel it's different this time around and that there is a lot at stake, being fought for and a lot of intentional ill will and hatred being fomented and focussed on dividing the citizenry.
      </p>
      <p>
       If anyone could briefly or deeply comment on the history of the religious right (which may be an inaccurate description) roots of mistrust of govt. sentiment, independent/Sovereign, Constitutionalist , Libertarian, CT adherent history/themes I'd be very interested.
      </p>
      <p>
       Otherwise keep up the good work, keep fighting, bringing the light to the darkness and damn you spooks n shills - y'all gonna burn.

       I think that is a large, purposeful part of all these reveals - engendering rage, overwhelming sensations and then despair at being powerless - the recent Boeckman situation, what your describing here at tribe.net, the twitter discovery and the historical through to PG seemingly globally linked events and groups all revealing the one degree of separation we who have researched or followed this stuff know exists between all these monarchy/aristocratic members, religious elite, political elite, academic/technocrasy elite, sports &amp; celeb. elites, corp. elites, police/social services/mil./alphabet agency elite etc...death cult members one and all.
      </p>
      <p>
       I want there to be revelations, arrests and executions but I fear it is simply exposure of a gradual, purposeful nature with the overall message of this is how it is, this is how it's always been and WTF are you going to do about it?
      </p>
      <p>
       Well end you permanently if I could but that kind of makes life difficult from there on out.

       Pedophile is individual attracted to a human being that is prepubescent, meaning, a human being that hasn't developed secondary sexual characteristics yet. Most children begin puberty anywhere from 9-13 yrs (in abnormal cases, 14 and above). Males typically begin puberty later than females, so that is why the cut-off is generally 13 years old (by doctors).

       From an evolutionary point of view, the continued existence of a species doesn't require zero destructive/maladaptive/"evil" individuals.  It only requires the number of destructive/maladaptive/"evil" individuals to stay low enough to not impede reproduction of better-adjusted individuals.  Within that framework for continued reproduction, evolution allows a species to try out all sorts of psychological combinations.

       Some of which are pretty fucked up.  Humans and our psychology make a helluvalot more sense within the context of an evolving system, but shits still messed up, yo.

       I heard there's some state legislator somewhere who wants pedophiles and sex offenders to be castrated... I'm honestly conflicted. Usually pretty libertarian, but this kinda shit makes me question it.
