    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s funny you brought up the sea, where you can zoom in with any average camera to see coastlines which should not be visible if there was a curve. I suspect if we had access to a giant telescope, we would be able to see distant continents. That is, unless the &quot;almost flat&quot; Earth is actually a dome with a slight curve, and none of us will ever get access to a telescope like that anyway.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re sitting in a moving car or train or what have you with no acceleration but a constant speed, you can throw something in the air and it won&#39;t move backwards.

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve only spent a few days looking at but my results are mixed. So far there seems to be answer for any problem, and most importantly, theoretical incentives for the conspiracy. Which tests did you do? </p>

<p>The round earth is a very new concept. Most of humanity&#39;s history, across almost all recorded societies across the world, believed (knew?), the earth is flat under a dome (and ancient libraries were burned, along with maps I assume). Then, when explorers set sail, even the Church, who literally set people on fire for going against the biblical view of the earth (flat, under a dome, sun created day 4, genesis, enoch), suddenly changed their tune and wrapped the map over a ball (a finite space). Why? Maybe because beyond the Antarctic ring there is a much, much bigger space (even infinite), with lush forests and treasure, which the banksters who run the world will keep from us forever (thanks to no one ever, ever, ever questioning it.) Maybe, who knows? The possibilities boggle the mind.</p>
