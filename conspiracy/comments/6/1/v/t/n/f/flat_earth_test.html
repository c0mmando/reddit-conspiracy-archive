       If the earth were flat, one could simply take a strong enough telescope to the top of a high mountain and see what's going on in China.  The horizon is also further away the higher you go.  Even at sea where there isn't a whole lot to block the view.

       That's funny you brought up the sea, where you can zoom in with any average camera to see coastlines which should not be visible if there was a curve. I suspect if we had access to a giant telescope, we would be able to see distant continents. That is, unless the "almost flat" Earth is actually a dome with a slight curve, and none of us will ever get access to a telescope like that anyway.

       The earth wobbles on it's axis, much like a spinning top when its starting to slow down. So its tilted this way and that way  thru the year, giving us seasons. Summer north is facing the sun, winter south, giving antarctica summer in january-february.

       But much of what "science" is is people telling you shit arbitrarily, ditto physicists and mathematicians, especially with complex subjects. Beware authorities and their agendas. I'd fear them more than some redditors sitting in sweatpants at home wondering about the shape of the earth.

       Big telescopes or good cameras should
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       be able to see ships and distant coastlines off in the distance, correct? The telescopes should simply zoom into the sky, but yet they can see. How?

       That could be the sun moving away. The flat eathers say there are two round orbs circling high in the sky, or below the dome, in a "yin-yang" shape. I'd say that mystery makes as much sense as the mystery of gravity, etc., wouldn't you agree?

       The "yin-yang" shape's origin is a mystery. I wonder if the ancient Chinese knew of the sun and moon's movements above the Earth, light and dark. I'd be interested to know if this is the meaning of the symbol, because those objects do move in a yin-yang circle, light and dark...

       How so? Blindly believing everything you were told in school is less mental energy and strength than questioning your reality. The thought process is lost on people who sleep even when they are awake.

       Watch videos of sun rise and set, the sun appears smaller as it goes away, and is too bright up above to really gauge its size. I would imagine round-earhers might say that atmosphere is denser further out as the sun sets, changing its size.

       The Bible says the Earth is flat, and with a firmament dome, see Book of Enoch, Book of Genesis. The Catholic Church believed in the flat earth model until very recently. Most of history, we believed in the Flat Earth, until the Age of Sail, when they probably found the Antarctic Ring (and beyond), and the largest conspiracy in history may have started.

       That's a new position they take, isn't it? I think for about a millennium or so they said the earth was flat, and the sun and moon move around us (under the dome presumably).

       Maybe at the droplet level, but the ocean is flat, no curvature, when you look at it. Put water in any vessel for that matter, and it will be flat on the surface, no bending ever.

       What do you think the stars are? That's one thing that puzzles me about the Flat Earth theory. It appears the dome, or firmament is spinning above, or the flat dis of Earth itself is spinning so that the stars appear to be spinning. Is that the case in this theory?

       It's like the moon looking upside down in the southern hemisphere (lol, I don't think "sphere" should be in that word if the world is flat.) I saw a video that explained it so simply: just tape a picture of the moon on the ceiling of a room and have two people look at from different ends and describe what they see. Duh! So easy to understand that one.

       Your downvotes show the fear some people have, and the fact that red-pilling only happens naturally and people can only do it on their own. Your second sentence I'd have to disagree with. I don't know the shape of the earth, but I believe most people are dead wrong.

       Best test almost anyone can do:
      </p>
      <p>
       Determine your hemisphere
      </p>
      <p>
       If you're in the northern hemisphere (at least most of it) go outside and observe that you cannot see the Southern Cross, or many Southern constellations that people in Australia can see
      </p>
      <p>
       If you're in the Southern hemisphere, you can't see Polaris
      </p>
      <p>
       The perspective argument is the most ludicrous thing I think I've ever heard. Get the strongest telescope you can find, I promise you won't be able to see the Southern Cross from Kansas.

       How can you say it feels like it? What does it "feel" like? Are you saying it "feels" that way because of your understanding that you're moving? Surely you can't mean you feel it physically, otherwise you wouldn't feel a difference in force during acceleration.. you'd feel the same at 60 mph while doing a 0-60 in a sports car as you would cruising at 60mph with no acceleration, but this isn't the case.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you're sitting in a moving car or train or what have you with no acceleration but a constant speed, you can throw something in the air and it won't move backwards. You don't feel anything when you're moving with an object that has momentum because you have no real forces acting against your motion.

       I've only spent a few days looking at but my results are mixed. So far there seems to be answer for any problem, and most importantly, theoretical incentives for the conspiracy. Which tests did you do?

       The round earth is a very new concept. Most of humanity's history, across almost all recorded societies across the world, believed (knew?), the earth is flat under a dome (and ancient libraries were burned, along with maps I assume). Then, when explorers set sail, even the Church, who literally set people on fire for going against the biblical view of the earth (flat, under a dome, sun created day 4, genesis, enoch), suddenly changed their tune and wrapped the map over a ball (a finite space). Why? Maybe because beyond the Antarctic ring there is a much, much bigger space (even infinite), with lush forests and treasure, which the banksters who run the world will keep from us forever (thanks to no one ever, ever, ever questioning it.) Maybe, who knows? The possibilities boggle the mind.
