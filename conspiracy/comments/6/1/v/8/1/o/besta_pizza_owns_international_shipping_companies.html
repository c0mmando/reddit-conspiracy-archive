       so I was searching thru some other businesses that used the same address and were linked to this other one -- what are the fucking odds that one of them just so happens to be a charity for 'abandoned and abused children in uganda?'
      </p>
      <p>

      </p>
      <p>
       ITS A NON PROFIT FOR ORPHANED LITTLE BLACK KIDS IN UGANDA -- maybe it's just me but WTF is with all of these "charities" for vulnerable children and their tangible connections to every fucking thing in this whole sick web?
      </p>
      <p>
       This is their board of directors. Doing more research now. NEED HELP!
      </p>
      <p>
       Roxanne Robbins, Founder | Director

      <p>
       Silver Kakozi, Art Instructor | Mentor
      </p>
      <p>
       Okay, also weird -- their link "for kids" goes to a URL that's clearly a bunch of jibberish typing, who the fuck takes the time to make this directory as a web developer and also link to the URL and code it, etc.? Fucking WEIRD! :

       This place is tied in with a shitload of other shady charities. Wanna see what the ties this Roxanna woman has -- she lives in Newport Beach and that's literally right a town over from Irvine.

       the new gold rush is capitalizing off disaster and the generous. they set up charities for kids, cities, relief funds, etc and get you to sign up for a monthly subscription of payments or a quick 10$ txt bill etc and the companies end of keeping 80% of the money for themselves. i also believe they use these 3rd world charities as trafficking rings.
      </p>
      <p>
       its similar to how TBN (trinity brodcast network) and churches will ask you for donations in exchange for god blessing or to show god your 'faith'. its all a sham and pastors for profit like joel olsteen have telemarketers from India who dont even believe in God take your money. people lose their savings giving it to these snakes who live in mansions and build churches big as football stadiums. these scumbags prey on the weak and desperate even in a shady form of deceiving the religious and gullible.

       That's a lot of links, which look really tough to follow.  I don't even see where you're making the connection between the Pizza place and any of these other businesses you listed- but there are a few things you need to understand before you try to dig up dirt.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         PRIVATE companies don't have to publish much information.  ALL private companies that act as fronts or shells will NOT be set up under the actual name of the person running it.  They'll be set up under the lawyer's name.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         A name is very little to go off of, without other pieces of confirmation- like birth dates or SSN.  If you look up my name, you will find other people with overlapping data- city of residence, schools attended, etc.  I've run background checks on myself and most of the information that comes up is incorrect.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         That's probably not a "shipping company", but an import/ export business.  Those names are arab (Saudi or Turkish).  Arabs are often involved in importing, because they have a network back home for low cost goods.  This is especially true with food.  Look at any of the ethnic products you might buy in the grocery store.  There is always an importer located in the US, whose name is on the packaging. They're a middle man who sources the product from abroad.  Turkey is one of the largest exporters of agricultural products in the world.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       All that said- restaurants are a good way of laundering money, because it's a cash business.  A lot of shady people get involved as investors in restaurants.  But I don't see any evidence of anything here, and would warn against potential doxxing.

       From: Cannibalism, Blood Drinking &amp; High-Adept SatanismMar 5, 2015 by Kerth Barker
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        At one point during our journey he explained to me that cannibalism among the wealthy Satanists living in the East Coast urban areas is quite common and well organized.
        <strong>
         He said that there were companies, each of which used some shell company as a front, which would sell high quality human meat for high prices.
        </strong>
       </p>
       <p>
        Bob told me that these dealers in cannibalistic products bring in human traffic from around the world.
        <strong>
         Low-income workers from abroad are brought in on cargo ships.
        </strong>
        They are lured in with stories of income they can earn at the “golden mountain,” which is the prosperous nation of America.
        <strong>
         Because these workers are undocumented, the human traffickers can do what they want with them.
        </strong>
        <strong>
         I learned that wealthy Luciferians control the docks and the city governments.
        </strong>
        Some of these undocumented workers are sold off for slave labor to work in sweat shops. Others are sold to professional food suppliers for cannibals.

       How dare you guys try to make sense of the world around you and assume a skeptical position on the mainstream/state-sponsored narrative. I'm going to mock and socially outcast you with the aim of hopefully dissuading others from following in your footsteps, because the potential for you to disrupt the narrative I've bought into unsettles me.

       Pretty sure illicit trade has always been used under the cover of legit trade companies.  There's been an international heroin network set up since the early 20th century..  Since the end of WW2 it's been run by a partnership of western intelligence agencies and organized crime.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Illegal heroin labs were first discovered near Marseille, France, in 1937. These labs were run by Corsican gang leader Paul Carbone. For years, the Corsican underworld had been involved in the manufacturing and trafficking of heroin, primarily to the United States.[1] It was this heroin network that eventually became known as "the French Connection".
The Corsican Gang was protected by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and the SDECE after World War II in exchange for working to prevent French Communists from bringing the Old Port of Marseille under their control.

       That's for police &amp; congressional investigations. If I suspected my neighbor was up to trafficking in kids I would investigate without definitive evidence. If I found something definitive then I'd call the cops.
