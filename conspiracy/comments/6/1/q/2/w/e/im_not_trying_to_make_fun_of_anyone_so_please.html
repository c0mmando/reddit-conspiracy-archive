       people always claim that there are legitimate issues and legitimate doubts, but there aren't. There is no "science"-group on this planet. You claim that each and everyone, every country, every university, every single person that goes into research, on earth, private or governmental, is automatically member of some secret society that never ever leaks information? that would be a tremendously potent logistic accomplishment. and all that effort just to fool the uneducated? you can buy a cheap telescope and prove all the laws of planetary movement by rechecking them with your own eyes. you could study the necessary physics and build your own electromagnetic tracking device, proving by your very own triangulation the movement of gps satellite. And you can just go to the antarctic and check. But people rather believe that website-dude.
You believe that the russians with all the necessary surveying equipment had not exposed the usa in the run for the moon for pulling a prank? That's a bit naive, isn't it?
