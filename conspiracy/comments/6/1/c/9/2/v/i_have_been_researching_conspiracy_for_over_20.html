       The flow of disinformation, contradicting stories, bad energy, fights on message boards, people just flat out putting each other down is off the charts. I've reached a point where I went from being a full blown participant in comment board conversations, to just posting articles and then ditching, letting people thumb them up or down or bicker among themselves. I do have one group of friends online for the last 9 years who I can debate seriously with without any emotional reaction to shit, but I'm watching the boards here, on Facebook, etc turning into war zones, even people supposedly on the same side, just ridicule and be so mean to each other.
      </p>
      <p>
       What's the point of that? Every one of us is going off of second hand information. Unless we've been at the meetings or a fly on the wall, none of us know the truth, we only know what we've been told.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, I love to research and I love sharing info, but sometimes if you don't step back you start going batshit.

       Yeah, I guess I haven't been into conspiracy as long as you but I like weeding through the muck . there's always internal bias and confirmation bias but I'm apolitical and more a skeptic then a believer in most things. Its like hunting for me.

       what you actually need to do is clear your thoughts, clear your mind. meditation. prayer. moment of silence.
      </p>
      <p>
       focus on breathing, focus on heartbeat.
      </p>
      <p>
       let your mind become inwardwardly aware of itself and your body and bodily functions. let your involuntary functions become voluntary. in other words, take mental control of your body and body functions, and synchronize your mind and body as one, and try to silence and settle both into a meditative, trance-like, zen-like state of mind and body
      </p>
      <p>
       if your mind is restless, give it a mundane task to perform, such as counting from 1 to 10, or reciting alphabet. these mundane tasks busy the mind and take the mind of other thoughts, even as these tasks are stimulating the mind in very old, basic patterns of thoughts that are deeply etched in your mind from the earliest age, the "root" of all your symbolic understandings, before it was tainted and laden with political and historical baggage
      </p>
      <p>
       after you do these counting or alphabet reciting, concentrate and reduce your minds attention to a smaller and smaller loop, like count to 4 over and over 1-2-3-4-1-2-3-4 etc (as a drummer might do in a song), then reduce further and count to 2 like 1-2-1-2-1-2 over and over,  then reduce and count to 1 like 1-1-1-1-1-1... thats your moment of zen
      </p>

       it was observed by his assistant that Rev Sun Myung Moon had the ability to focus his attention to a single point, and that seemed to impress the assistant enough to emphasize this fact during a documentary about Rev Moon (Of Moonies Cult infamy) Emperor of the Universe Google Videos not Youtube, very obscure and hard to find
      </p>
      <p>
       i think everyone has the ability to focus their attention to a single point, but they do not know how or do not practice enough.
      </p>

       once you settle your mind, fill your mind with high-vibrational thoughts (good vibes) by thinking of nice words like love, peace, joy, happiness, life, etc

       What about common sense? Just stop expecting to be told the truth and assemble the narrative yourself. That is what is at the heart of "conspiracy". Take the puzzle pieces you know exist and find more on your own, doing your own research. The MSM is only there to show you what they want the picture to look like. Discover it for yourself.

       I have been trying to pay attention for awhile, and I agree with you. But, my #1 indicator of a malicious user, someone who is not there to exchange information in any way for whichever reason, is the personal attacks. Today is the worst I have ever seen it. Hands down, by a factor of 10, I have never seen it this bad. And it has been bad enough before.

       It really seems like they came in on the back of the infowars PG statement. And that just tells me that we need to keep doing whatever we are doing, because it bothers the right people.

       Well as you said its emotionally charged. Its just like party politics. If you suggest something that goes against someone elses belief they will get angry and attack you for it. Whether they are right or wrong is irrelevant. An avid Trump supporter for example will defend a bad policy as strongly as they would defend a good policy.

       I see two very different universes created in the media. The division is intentional and keeps the public from being able to pull together to fight the tyranny.  I can pull up "factual" information and argue "facts" from both sides until I am blue in the face. We are being propagandized harder than the public in any Latin American country going through a coup. It is for control through semantic isolation as rights, choices and liberties are being taken away. You are living in an echo chamber created by very powerful algorithms created by and for you. So is the person sitting next to you.

Everything you think, do or say is logged, and thoughts can be isolated like the cancers they are.

       While you're right to be skeptical of the Russian conspiracy theories until any hard evidence is presented, your questions have pretty obvious answers.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Russia interfered with our elections to:_______.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Help elect candidates that would be favorable to Russian interests, e.g. easing sanctions, reducing American interference in Syria, weakening NATO.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        And the preceding administration knows this and is withholding the information because:__________.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Presumably because exposing the source might compromise it (say if it were a spy, a compromised web server, a wiretap, etc). No one really knows though, so we're right to be skeptical.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        And the hundreds of holdover government employees (who have leaked everything else) haven't leaked a single piece of damning information showing collusion because:__________.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       If there were any collusion, you would obviously do it through intermediaries, involve only trusted parties, leave no email/paper trail, etc.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        And if they have (or don't have) this information, they obtained it by:____________.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Assumably some classified intelligence gathering. See above.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        And if every American is under government surveillance, the incoming administration WASN'T under surveillance because:_______________.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Trump claimed he was being targeted by the Obama Administration which there's no evidence for. Now you're arguing that "technically we're all under surveillance"? You're just moving the goalposts.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't really buy the Russian collusion either--election interference seems plausible--but it's weird to see conspiracy theorists apply a level of scrutiny that most of their pet theories wouldn't withstand.

       Climbing lead levels in the water, too.  Lead is neurotoxic.  Soil depletion from industrial farming is also leading to micronutrient deficiencies.  That's causing irritability from subclinical disregulation of neuromuscular responses.  People are more tense and have a lowered pain threshold.

       My friend once told me only to bother with news in the ten miles around you. If something happens outside that area that is worth knowing about, people will tell you. At that point, research it on your own. You will avoid the initial brainwashing and figure out what's going on.

       It gets lonely for sure. Most people, albeit informed that some stuff is severely off, adhere (without question) to some other ideological fallacy. I never stop questioning, even when it makes me question reality itself. It's a demanding place to be mentally.
      </p>
      <p>
       I see the awakening happening at an increased rate. 10 years ago people had no clue, look at the difference now and imagine just 5 years more. Truth is inevitable, and through finally arguing; people will get there sooner. 
Even those who prefer the lie will come to terms, once enough people have stepped over.
      </p>
      <p>
       Conspiracy theories as a whole, is no longer a fringe topic. Once the stigma is completely crushed; the flood gates will open.

       I agree, something has changed
      </p>
      <p>
       I have long thought that underneath all the other problems, it is the disintigration of language itself.  Like for some people, being pro family means being for the drug war and against abortion but against public education.  Which I think is crazy, but these are millions of people who aren't murderous but their way of thinking politically allows every cartel killing in mexico.
      </p>
      <p>
       And there are 100 things like that I thought would have been cleared up by obvious history, like, the drug war having absolutely no potential victory possible whatsoever.

       It's not an environment conducive to long term thinking and authentic discussion, and everyone is silo'ing themselves.

       yeah, they get the codes to shut down our defenses if trump sells us out, which he totally would do, maybe not knowingly
      </p>
      <p>
       that's the thing with all these meetings prior to and after the election, what arrangements are they making?   I'd be suspicious about any foreign meetings like that, but russia?  When he does business over there?  Supersketchy
      </p>
      <p>
       I think though what they really want is an american civil war where we dissolve like the soviet union did for what putin probably sees as a point of ego, he wants to see both have to reform not that the american system is just more resilient etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       So why not use our openness and stupidity when it comes to foreign bribery to just exacerbate all the tension points using manipulations of new media ie meta site networks (news aggregators with no publicly stated journalistic staff reposting in echo chambers on reddit with team of thousands precisely trolling to get the next big police standoff rolling.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then once ferguson is on fire permanently and large areas of the big cities are in total disorder, there is concern over the nuclear missile arsenal.
      </p>
      <p>
       those are 2 scenarios where this leads to actual invasion, strategically trump is a complete disaster, overthrowing decades of the actual good part of america's spying.
      </p>
      <p>
       putin is an autocrat and is just as evil as hitler, if not more because he is more calculating, capable and media savy.
      </p>
      <p>
       china and russia could definitely take over or split the united states, especially with israel's help and a traitor president.

       I found some weird bushes with red berries on them... I'm a curious kinda guy so I ate a berry to see what it tasted like... delicious! So I ate a bunch more... they have big seeds in the middle so I spit all those out cause I really hate anything with seeds in it... When I got home I googled about to see what I was munching on... Yew Berries. Just 3 berries is enough to kill a full grown man if you eat the seeds... luckily I spit them all out. Still doesn't stop me from eating weird fruits and berries... guess what... most stuff you don't see for sale in a grocery store isn't there cause it is either poisonous or tastes like total ass.

       Because of people like you, the pressure is on like never before. People are starting to realize that so-called conspiracy theories are actually really true (e.g. PizzaGate, NSA, CIA, Hastings, etc.). So the powers that be are removing all the stops to perform damage control. Don't give up now - your 20 years is paying off.

       All that said, I don't want to make it worse.  I'm attracted also to the number of really clever people using this board.  There's a lot of respect for valuing reality over perception and putting truth ahead even when it's hazardous, and these things really make a community valuable.

       Once we get them burning, then we add more pizza evidence to the bonfire, but it's like a nuke.  You can't blow up a nuke on it's own, you need a primary.

       Sadly that is probably what the shills and aggressive hostile posters want. But I totally hear you and have felt the same way on many occasions. It can be disheartening to deal with. I wish there was something we could do about it to make things better. Anybody got any ideas?

       I feel the opposite. I have never been more optimistic and full of life than in 2017. When I was first red pilled 20 years ago I considered the fight against the Illuminati to be a futile effort. The creation of the New World Order was a foregone conclusion that could not be stopped. It was part of a divine plan that would lead to the coming of the anti-Christ and Armageddon. The plan was thousands of years in the making so it was man's fate to be destroyed like Atlantis was destroyed.
      </p>
      <p>
       For me 9/11 was the low point because it seemed nothing could be done to wake people up. I pretty much resigned myself to believing that the dark timeline would triumph and the Illuminati would destroy humanity to usher in the age of demons. However, it didn't unfold that way.
      </p>
      <p>
       Many planned false flags have been prevented due to pro-active conspiracy theory. The community has exploded in size in recent years. I couldn't be happier with the number of free thinking souls that now seem to be everywhere. I went from being a lone voice crying out in the wilderness to now being drowned out by a tsunami of the awakened. I am fine with that. It is better this way because it means humanity is winning this fight.
      </p>
      <p>
       Be of good cheer. Victory over the Illuminati and the new world order is at hand.

       Just remember Republicans always lie and always project. When a Republican accuses somebody of doing something they are doing it. They created all of the fake conspiracy theories in this sub, and they will never stop lying to cover up their lies.

       People enjoy talking about and unearthing real conspiracies. Instead, this place has been overrun by political attacks and made up conspiracies. There's a very obvious political agenda behind pumping up bullshit conspiracies (e.g., Pizzagate -- oh no here come the downvotes!) and it takes the wind out of all other conspiracies.

       Human trafficking is happening, no question. Powerful people or politicians may be involved. Comet Ping Pong, Clinton, Podesta, etc. is nonsense based on bullshit internet detective work.

       There's a difference between fact and fiction. Pizzagate is pure internet fan fiction. And if it weren't for the invented link to Hillary Clinton, nobody on this sub would even be talking about human trafficking.

       Disinfo aside, this forum and others seem to have slowly turned into intelligence contests to brag about how Red Pilled you are. "Yeah that's a great post, but here's why it's wrong/misleading and I can't believe you didn't mention X, Y, and Z." There doesn't seem to be any interest in consensus building anymore.

       What's the conspiracy tho? Just because someone does or says something you don't like doesn't mean they're involved in a conspiracy.

       Naturally, people who are "into conspiracies" are aware of their own lack of knowledge about the true nature of things.  There's a certain humility that comes along with this.  In the last 6 months, many people have become part of the conspiracy world (myself included), but they only bought into it because of a particular conspiracy, with a predetermined idea of what the conspiracy was.
      </p>
      <p>
       When information challenges that, cognitive dissonance occurs, and they reject it. They aren't looking at conspiracies as "seeking the truth", they are simply believing in a conspiracy and participating in the forum because of that, which creates a lot of hostility towards anything that challenges them.

       That's my guess.
