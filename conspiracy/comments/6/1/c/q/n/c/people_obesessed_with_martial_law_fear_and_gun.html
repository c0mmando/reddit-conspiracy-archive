<p>now, what is your argument towards my first comment sir? i state that martial law wont be effective if people have means to fight back, meaning them taking our guns makes perfect sense, do you think people are gonna just keep their guns locked up and give their rights to freedom away? some will sure, but i sure wouldn&#39;t, i just watched that new red dawn movie, i really enjoyed it as it seems like a plausable future</p>

    <div class="md"><p>i never stated i had guns in the first place, when i said our i was reffering to our common folk, but yes, guns can protect ones freedom. Even though america lost it&#39;s battle for independance, their guns helped them fight for their freedom, if someone comes on your property and starts telling you exactly how to live your life, yes guns protect your freedom, it&#39;s sad that one must kill these days, many people just wan&#39;t to carry on with their lives under the current system, but this current system is tightning itself up more and more by the day, so yes, one should have guns to protect their independence.</p>

<p>you are asking, are my guns protecting my freedom from other people with guns who fight against freedom, you know my answer, and you are free to have your own answer</p>

<p>Using pretty much any ISP right now? Regulation allows that. Buy food from a grocery? Government agencies insure someone isn&#39;t selling you literal poison. Moreover, localities ensure business are properly registered with business licenses.</p>

<p>Drive a car or ride a bike? They have to meet government regulations for safety standards. Blah blah blah etc etc etc.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No power wants an armed populace its bad for business. Its better to have a population that cannot defend themselves. Disarming civilians is a tactic used throughout history to dampen the potential of any rebellions.</p>

<p>Im not sure when this will happen though. So far there are no signs it will be in the near future. I am sure that is one of the many aims of these elitists. A society with guns doesn&#39;t benefit the people who own the country it is a threat to them.</p>

<p>Privatisation is a constant theme in this day and age. Privatising violence so that it can only be used by the government is a part of this.</p>

<p>Letting all the retards keep their 9mms so that they feel &quot;safe&quot; just fosters complacency. There&#39;s no reason to subvert that to just take all the guns - which has never been seriously floated anyway.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Short term profit is worth less than long term goals. Money would be meaningless to the powers if they governed everything without opposition. Plus to elitists money is almost meaningless, they do print it freely.</p>

<p>Guns are a threat to an organised power that preys on the ignorance of its people, if they ever became aware they would have the means to fight back. The ratio of people to authority is always massively unbalanced in our favour. So 9mm, as you put it, would still give people all the oppurtunity needed to fight against a suppressive regime. Also anti-gun laws are another great way to divide and conquer people.</p>

<p>To say taking guns serves no meaningful function is ignorant. Many times have people been disarmed so that an oppressive regime can go unchallenged. Hitler did exactly that to the jews. Excuse me good sir let me hold onto your guns, don&#39;t worry, we will keep you safe you can trust us....</p>

<p>But I will add you don&#39;t have to disarm everyone, just those who are most likely to offer resistance or who you intend to target first.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Everyone jumps straight to the revisionist history...</p>

<p>The Weimar were far more strict in gun control than the Nazis. Very few were entitled to own guns, and even fewer did (1918 Treaty of Versailles banned private gun ownership, 1928 Reichstag very minimally diminishes that). </p>

<p>All the nazis did was slightly loosen gun control for &quot;ordinary&quot; Germans. To say they performed disarmament pursuant to controlling the population is just blatantly untrue. </p>

<p>More importantly, guns or not, the absolutely minuscule population of Jews wasn&#39;t going to stop anything (1% of Germany&#39;s population).</p>

<p>There&#39;s no logic in saying that Hitler needed or would have even cared to use gun control to affect Jews ability to resist when they already didn&#39;t own guns.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I never said that at all I said they diarmed the jews. The reason I mentioned jews is because its divide and conquer. Slowly enforce rules on one section, then expand from there.</p>

<p>Gun control is an important part of totalitarianism which is what we are heading to one step at a time. I said earlier there is nothing to suggest gun control is going to be implimented anytime soon. But in the future, whether that is 20-30-40-50+ years guns will no longer be accessible to regular citizens. And this is all done slowly like most things. You start by taking rifles, you bring in stricter laws, you dish out propaganda and embelish or be very vocal about any negative instances involving guns. Its the same with all forms of control. They didn&#39;t just flip a switch one day and destroy privacy, it is a slow build up which eventually reaches a climax.</p>

<p>The important part of something like this is to stop it ahead of time instead of waiting for it to happen in the future. Its so easy to ridicule people and claim they are paranoid or exxagerating when these schemes are in the early stages, happens all the time. Yet years down the line all the pieces start falling into place and its to late to do anything about it. We have now reached a point with privacy where governments and corporation own every single piece of information about us. Soon they will even be able to sell your internet history of to the highest bidder when the bill passes.</p>

<p>Privacy - Gun control - Barcodesque system - Media (information) control - Natural resource control etc... basically every aspect of your life needs to be directly controlled by TPTB to ensure you follow their way of life and their rules.</p>

<p>100% Guns will not be apart of any &quot;New World Order&quot; type ideal. The whole idea is to centralize power. An armed populace is a threat to any dictator or dictators.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t immediately say they&#39;re coming for &#39;em, I just recognize that with the laws on the books martial law operates outside the normal bounds of the Constitution - gun confiscation is not outside of their legal authority under martial law.  </p>

<p>It would be a daunting challenge to go nationwide on a gun confiscation run, however, if this operation were undertaken it just wouldn&#39;t consist of all kinetic operations, although they would play a major role - and foreign troops are not needed because between local, state and federal law enforcement there is enough manpower to accomplish the task.  It would undoubtedly be a full spectrum endeavor and would, unfortunately, inevitably be successful.</p>
