      <p>
       Did you Know: Hitler brought about many democratic values will still keep today, like enviromental laws, Animal rights (Despite propaganda films showing him abusing animals). He even created free health care and offered financial support for his people. Even anti-smoking campaigns.
      </p>
      <p>
       Did you Know: In a year hitler had reduced unemployement (7 Million) by over 3 million, 6+ Million in 2 years, In 5 years germany had gone from a great depression to a leader in economy, technology, science and art.
      </p>
      <p>
       Did You Know: Hitler backed his bonds in the labour of his people as opposed to the jewish banks debt system. That he protected the land of his workers so that it would be passed from father to son. That, despite jewish propaganda that renounced anyone who dealt with germans through trade, he traded with many countries, cutting the private banks out completely and ensuring better deals for all parties involved.
      </p>
      <p>
       Did you Know: The "Death Camp" contained an Olympic sized swimming pool, A hospital, A library. 
Did you know: Residents of these camps confirmed in interviews they had orchestras, movies, camp money, canteens, postcards, letters, theatre, musical plays and a football team.
      </p>
      <p>
       Did you Know: Despite the volume of documents retrieved after the war not one photograph, video or autopsy report was found concerning the supposed gas chamber victims.
      </p>
      <p>
       Did you Know: Hitler tried for peace at every juncture of the war
      </p>
      <p>
       Did you Know: 73 Women, children and babies were raped repeatedly by the soviets, murdered, then nailed to doors, trees and wagons as though nailed to a cross. This scene was photographed and Hitler asked for neutral countrys including switzerland and spain to come and do an independant review of these war crimes but recieved no response.
      </p>
      <p>
       Did you Know: The Allied forces repeatedly bombed whole citys, time and time again, with the intention to kill as many civilians as possible. That they didn't hesitate to bomb schools full of children and that they would come time and time again, day and night. Later known as germanys hiro, called terror bombing by the german people.
      </p>
      <p>
       Did you Know: The only reason this was not immediately followed by chemical attacks was because, after suggesting such a thing, winston churchill was warned hitler may respond in kind.
      </p>
      <p>
       Did you Know: Hitler did not respond to these war crime bombings for three months in the hopes that "They will stop this nonsense". Until then he had issued orders that only military bases were to be targetted.
      </p>
      <p>
       Did you Know: Crowds of people gathered to welcome the germans as they swept across soviet territory, throwing flowers and offering blessings to the germans, seeing them as saviours from a oppressive regime under stalin.
      </p>
      <p>
       Did you Know: The sheer amount of war crimes committed, first by the soviets, then by the rest of the allied forces as they closed in on germany after the soviets pushed germany back during the russian winter, were phenominal. Women raped over and over and over again, children raped, many murdered. German soliders who had surrendered were lined up, sometimes by the hundreds, and mowed down with mounted machine guns. The survivors were then forced to stand whilst the guns were reloaded. The Allie moto passed down by the hierachy was "The only good german is a dead one"
      </p>
      <p>
       Hitler fought against jewish control, fought against the czechs mistreatment of his people, threatend war when they would not allow the 3 million germans who wished to return home due to the violence they suffered on a daily basis, and only after this threat were the germans released. Poland placed germans in camps before the war had even begun, that they killed over 5000 and shot down refugees who were fleeing to germany.
      </p>
      <p>
       The propaganda against hitler is incredible, the lies told unbelievable. He fought against the jews who had instigated communism into russia under stalin, he knew what they were capable of and he set out to stop them. Jews had prominent roles all through germany at the time of hitlers rise to power, they had control of over 50% of the media, 70% of judges. They controlled many entertainment venues, pushing plays and movies some containing sexual perversions of all kinds. The huge support behind hitler was brought on by the very fact people were fed up with what the jews were doing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Jews before, during and after have made sure hitler became reviled and despised. But hitler first pulled his people out of poverty then he defended them from threat after threat. He was forced time and time again to push his war efforts further and further afield despite offering peace time and time again. The real war criminals were the allied forces.
      </p>
      <p>
       Because of the Allied propaganda he will always be seen as evil and a dictator, I too thought this, when the truth is he was one of the finest and most inspiring leaders of our time. He fought the jews, the banks, for free press.....In return the jews sought to take him down as this was against everything they stood for and everything they still stand for today.
      </p>
      <p>
       He was loved so much by his people they refused to surrender or turn on the nazi regime despite the increased effort from allies at the end of the war to force such a thing through violence. We would be lucky to have him in place of the corporate, banker whores we have today.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would recommend people look into this themselves, to make an informed decision themselves instead of dismissing this as ridiculous just because of the implications it presents. I never thought I would be turned into a hitler sympathizer, let alone to end up admiring the man for his accomplishments. But after looking into this, comparing as many different sources of information as I could find and pitting this against the story I already knew through MainStream knowledge, I can't help but be convinced they have demonised a german hero.
      </p>
      <p>
       R.I.P Adolf Hitler. Unfortunately history is decided, written and published by the victors.

       Wow, mods.  You allow posts that glorify Adolf Hitler and have nothing to do with conspiracy theories.  You also enforce your rules selectively instead of fairly.  You ban people for stepping out of line, but do nothing about repeated attacks towards users if those attacks are made by people who believe Pizzagate.
      </p>
      <p>
       Adolf Hitler was not a German hero.  He was a drug addict who caused millions of deaths and took the cowards way out by suck starting a pistol instead of facing defeat like a warrior.
      </p>
      <p>
       Plus, he was Austrian, as anybody who's ever read a book could tell you.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let me tell you about someone I admire, OP. My grandfather. He enlisted when WW2 broke out and used to tell me about how many Nazis he killed.  That lucky bastard.  I'd give anything for the opportunity to slaughter every goddamned Nazi I could. He was a hero that risked his life.  Hitler was a bitch that took his life.

       How does this have nothing to do with conspiracy. My post is presenting an opposing view to the mainstream version, which if true would confirm a MASSIVE Conspiracy to cover up what really happened.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why would i believe he was a drug addict? He achieved so many things in such a short space of time if he was a drug addict I want some of whatever he was having. He didn't cause millions of deaths the propaganda that forced war did, he saved his country from depression and turned it into a world power. He did this in 5 years. Presidents in America can't even achieve a fraction of this in two four year terms.
      </p>
      <p>
       If he did kill himself at the end I wouldn't blame him. The way the allies treated the civilians was probably nothing compared to what they would do to the leader.
      </p>
      <p>
       What has austrian heritage got to do with being a german hero. He saved germany and then tried to protect it.

       Just because you have a view that most people find disgusting doesn't mean this is a "conspiracy".  This was just a cheap attempt at glorifying a drug addicted coward.

       Because it's common knowledge to everyone who's actually researched the little bitch.  Watch three seconds of this video:
       <a href="https://youtu.be/IB8FCye08g8">
        https://youtu.be/IB8FCye08g8
       </a>
       The fact that bitch boy was a meth head is known to those who have read about him. Maybe read books before singing the praises of suicidal junkies.
      </p>
      <p>
       I wish he didn't puss out.  Maybe some American GIs could have fucked him to death with a bayonet.  Or maybe just starved him and removed a kidney without anesthesia.
      </p>
      <p>
       It wasn't "Austrian heritage".  He was from Austria.  He was an Austrian.
      </p>
      <p>
       You don't know where he was born, or that he was widely known as a meth addict, and yet you worship him?   Yeah, I guess it's easy to fall deeply in love with someone you don't know anything about.

       Why so mad? I have been looking into this version of hitler for a while, 3 seconds of a youtube video won't change my mind because im not a retard that is swayed that easily.
      </p>
      <p>
       You keep calling him a bitch boy methhead yet most meth heads can't even dress and wash themselves. He achieved an economic miracle and was featured in magazines as man of the year. He then lead a war effort against country after country with ease, only finally being stopped by a winter in russia he was trying to avoid and a gang of countries who marched against him. He turned a country in depression into an unstoppable economic and military force. whatever your views on him no one can deny the accomplishment that is.
      </p>
      <p>
       You missed my point that he was a german hero because he saved germany, i don't need to discuss where he was from because it is irrelevant.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can call him a meth head all you like but the evidence says otherwise and I know just how much propaganda was used against him.

       Feel free to watch the video link i posted. Obviously youtube videos should never be a go to source for a conspiracy But out of all the sites and other videos ive looked at this one has loads of information crammed into its 4 hour runtime. It also has very important things like video footage, photos, images of news papers and books it quotes from etc etc etc....All around a good effort from the people who made it and a great place to start as you can follow up the links and sources form there.
      </p>
      <p>
       Obviously you didn't watch the video link though you just down voted my post and wrote a comment saying it was wrong within the first minute. Because thats what a critical thinker does.

       This post is pretty obviously being brigaded by some antifa. You can approach the subject of Hitler and the Holocaust without being an arrogant asshole. Berating someone has never changed an opinion, but they aren't fans of reasonable argument, just anger driven derision.

       It is a very touchy subject ofc but now I have more information to go on I am a strong believer that hitler has been wronged. Even when I type adolf hitler in my mind I feel like its a bad word or that it relates to something bad, thats how deep propaganda goes. But now I know better and he deserves better than universal hatred so I will atleast defend him when I can. They are going to love me at work when I start telling them about how great hitler actually was.

       Don't put words in my mouth. I was simply pointing out that if you would not even entertain the thought that maybe some facts of our history were incorrect. That maybe you should investigate these claims. If upon finding out they are full of shit. It would provide you a way to refute arguments like this and help further the spread of the truth.

       Kind of the goal of this sub is to question everything. Question it, ask for specific sources of his. Be polite and then find the holes in his argument to refute. It will make your message that much more powerful.

       I have my views and in this post I have given some reasons as to why I feel the way I do. I see no proof that the holocaust is real besides mainstream garbage. The waco incident showed me just how easy it is to hire fake victims and witness'. I have seen videos of survivors saying how well they were treated in these camps. I am sure people died in the camps but that is to be expected in any camp, sickness is a major problem. If you compare images and footage from the german camps to the russian camps it makes the german camps look like a holiday camp.

       My great grandfather got a DSM at Dunkirk and his brother died on the same beach.
      </p>
      <p>
       That said, history HAS skewed the rise of the Nazi Party, its goals and ambitions and the subsequent events during WWII IMO. Even my grandfather (above mentioned son) has said the same to me that looking back, Europe had no idea what was going on in Germany because the radio was controlled by Allies.

       Churchill said it himself "History is written by the victors"

       A good litmus test in my opinion is this : When a subject causes such a strong reaction in yourself, then that is exactly the subject that needs to be re-examined. Whether it's someone questioning faith, the existence of aliens, conspiracy or Hitler.
      </p>
      <p>
       I say that with no malice but I urge you to read a bit further into the subject and not just 'approved' academia either.

       Remember, they are the same that tell us Oswald killed JFK, Vietnam wasn't begun with a false flag and in future will tell us 9/11 was perpetrated by Arabs with box-cutters.

       Potentially but the holocaust was named by the Jews for the Jews where millions of non-jews, notably 'more' Russian's died during the same period.

       WW2 proved that the only way to change a Nazi's mind was with a well-aimed shot.  I don't own a gun, but I'm not going to engage in a debate with someone who thinks that all the photos, history books, and firsthand accounts from Allied soldiers, holocaust survivors, and former Nazis are all lies.  YouTube is realsies, but the thousands of accounts and millions of books written are all a liberal conspiracy.

       I didn't know that Nazism was openly accepted here.  I've seen anti-Semitism, but openly fellating a dead coward was something I didn't expect.

       Its just a disgrace. You have to be so sick to not only condone and commit these horrific crimes against people, but then to lie and conceal it with no remorse afterwards. People will obviously hate and downvote to oblivion and that is their right but I strongly believe hitler was doing something that could of benefited the world. Instead he is one of the most hated and reviled figures in history. All because of jewish/zionist propaganda.

       It is only recently as I finished researching tthis topic that I came to this view. Im not a nazi, Im not a white supremisist or a racist. I havent lived my whole life declaring hitler as great. I have just compared an alternate version to the mainstream version and found the alt to make alot more sense than any propaganda bullshit.

       As far as I know in 1939, all German Jewish men were to be called “Israel,” and all Jewish women must be called “Sarah.” If, for example, a Jewish man had the name “Ignatz,” he must now register a new name, either “Israel-Ignatz,” or “Ignatz-Israel,” in his official documents. In addition, the Nazis have decreed that any letters Jews write to governmental agencies must be written in their official “Jewish” names so that the authorities will know that they are dealing with Jews. According to the Nazi Ministry of the Interior, Jewish newborns must bear Jewish names and will not be permitted to have German names at all. The ministry is creating a list of old-fashioned Jewish names for newborn Jewish children.

       OP I have been searching for an article for awhile that I read once. It was a journalist who went to a russian camp I believe. Some of the key things about it were the buildings were miles long but narrow. So crammed full of people that they had no choice but to excrement on those below them.
      </p>
      <p>
       The women and  men were seperated. The lice was horrendous.. A choice quote I remember was the guy saying how the women were being eaten alive yet sat there motionless. Soul-less like they had given up. Only moving to take their hand to shovel out a handful of lice from their pubic hair.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was a eye witness account to one of the worst camps of that time period and I just feel stupid that I cannot find it or remember the name.. Have you perhaps any idea on the camp name?

       If you can find it I would be interested to read it. Images of the buildings don't show insides crammed with people, the buldings are ofc long because that is more cost effective. How long though is hard to tell with the images I can find. Not very narrow though it would take many people abreast to fill up the width.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for lice I wouldn't be surpised if it was an issue. I mean a camp is a camp, Im not saying people didn't die of sickness and the conditions were perfect. No war camp was renowned for its good conditions but not many would have movie theatres and such. The russian camps had worse conditions than the germans.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again if you find the article I would be interested in it so I can research the guy, find out what paper it was in etc.

      <p>
       How about the fact that Wall Street and the Bush family and the children and grandchildren of the robber barons put Hitler in power and funded armed and equipped Nazi Germany and tried to have a coup against FDR. They also put the Bolsheviks in place.

       Yeah anti semitic means nothing to me, just another way of squashing freedom of speech and to prevent people from ever question what a group of people does.It is actually illegal to question the offical story of the holocaust in several eroupean countries and is punishable with lengthy prison sentences. This is the only event of its kind to ever be illegal to discuss.

       It's published in dozens of books by Anthony Sutton and others. That term is abused in the media yes but in this case you just have no clue what you are talking about. Stop larping. I do know everything about that period because I actually did the work and did the reading. You watched a you tube video with someone acting out a fantasy of what they wanted to be true to further an agenda. Go back to the drawing board and do the right thing and get it right, shame on you little boy.

       Anti semitic isn't just abused in the media the whole foundation of the word is to stop any discourse against the jews. The media is prominently jewish owned so its no surprise to see if abused in the media.
I have no clue what I am talking about? All you are doing is parroting mainstream information. Ive seen these same people use fake witness' and testimonies time and time again. The war in the middle east was helped by a girls testimony of terrible tragedys happening in the east, which then turned out to be fake. Its what they do now and have always done. Hide any truth admist a well funded smear campaign.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have watched videos, researched on sites, researched the research on those sites. You claiming all I did was watch a video when you actually have no clue what I did shows your just spouting of anything you can. I have done my part to educate myselves on both sides of a story than make a decision on where I stand.
      </p>
      <p>
       All you do Is try and attack me instead of the post. You say you have seen jews write books and do interviews on how evil the nazis were, I have seen jews do interviews on how surprised they were at the conditions of these death camps. surprised they could go and watch movies and swim, play football and read. I have sen jews themselves desiputing the gas chambers and claiming them to be false even though all they got from it was hate and discorn from there own people. Hardly a reward worth lying for.

       You call me a little boy because I question offical stories and don't just parrot what I am told to believe.

       Well I just have it to you. Anthony Sutton, Smedley Butler. Patton. My grandfather, who liberated a concentration camp and has the diaries of the survivors that he acquired for two cartons of cigarettes and a case of chocolate bars. Real books from real people who lived through. Yes I do know every thing about it because I went to the sources: not those they teach the retards in school but sources that governments rely on to get the record and make decisions upon.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nobody said anything about the Jews except you. Stop acting out a fantasy and start living in the real world. We all know the holocaust killed about as many non Jews as it did Jews but it actually happened, it was still real, it isn't fake. Hitler wasn't good. I have books written by people who were there. You have a you tube video and a fantasy, an anti Semitic fantasy. Stop larping and start living in reality. Educate yourself.

       I don't never seen any definitive proof of the holocaust, no video or photographs even though the germans documented everything heavily.

       Most of these post is just you repeating yourself and giving nothing of value.

I have many comments on nazis, hitler and germany but they can all be sourced back to this post and another one. So 2 original posts on WW2, many comments because I like to dsicuss my views not just make them and run away never to be seen again until the next post.

       These are some the posts I was involved in before WW2 posts. I dont mention WW2 in any of them and if anyone wishes to look further they will find little to no evidence of me posting nazi propaganda. I have posted a couple of things on my views of WW2 as is allowed on a conspiracy site and protected by my freedom of speech (unless I live in certain european countries in which case id go to prison for even mentioning an opposing view to the offical holocaust.)

       we here with ya brother.  im just looking into this.  the REASON i am has nothing to do with ww2 itself.  I am just noticing so many parallels to what has happened in history to whatis going on today.  Right away in my head I asked myself " was hitler just defending his country from a zionist govt?" this thought sprang into my head organically as far as i am concerned.  This to me is an important point.  i noticed what is happening around me and went back to history to see if there is some cycle we are repearing and if so, why? the guy responding to you just takes the MSM version of history and decides its correct.  its plain to see there are those perpetuating a cycle of war and manipulation and if you just want to accept what you have been told that is up to you.  to try to smother any other idea other than what you believe makes you a bigot and your actually hurting your own argument.  If the official version is so sound and unquestionable let it stand on its own.  the fact that your in here defending the official version tells me it isnt as cut and dry as its made out to be and only makes me ask more questions.

       The problem is people are so against seeing the WW2 story from other angles. I am not, and never will, claim hitler or the nazi's to be saints or heroes BUT they definitely aren't the height of evil they were made out to be. The allied forces committed acts as bad as the supposed holocaust, and these acts are throughly documented and recorded, whereas the concentration camps are surrounded by lies and the holocaust's existence is easy to question. So whilst neither side could be called heroic, We committed acts as bad as the germans, or acts much worse if the holocaust is fake like I believe. I don't believe 6 million jews died (the russians changed this number themselves) and I believe they died because we bombed the trains which cut of supplys to germany....This ofc would cut of supplies to the prisoners aswell as the people, and from accounts and documentation the german people weren't much better of than those in the concentration camps near the end, with no supplies and there major cities bombed and inferno'd by us, babies turned to liquid in the streets.

       I haven't followed conspiracy for a little while now so I forget alot of the links, I can remember a good video that shows the other side of WW2, the sick things done by the west. The woman who narrates it is obviously abit biased as you will see from the anger in her voice, but you can't really blame her once you see the other side.

       It's jewish propanganda. Jews played a big role in ww1 and ww2, both of which are linked together in more than just the WW. Ofc it wasn't your average joe jew that was involved, It was a handful of influential jews not the whole religion. Jews and the allied leaders pushed the story to get more sympathy for the jews who had been causing alot of trouble, they also made speaking against jews basically illegal, ever since WW2 jews have been mostly untouchable.

       Hating on Elitist jews is not racist. The whole jewish religion is based on racism. The constant theme of the torah is the belittlement of every other race except jews.
      </p>
      <p>
       So basically you are repeating the same line that I watched some 20min Yt vid and decided hitler is actually not the demon he is made to be. Can you prove I only watched a single youtube video? Do you have evidence of this?

       No I said you would use one to refute me not that your ideas came from one. I have slightly more respect for you than that. I still find your ideas to be racist and strange. For instance, seems to me odd to hate on people managing to essentially control everything as some people would have you believe the jews do if you hold capitalistic beliefs.
      </p>
      <p>
       Personally I didn't get that from reading the torah, so where is that explanation coming from? There is nothing in the Tanach that says race a &gt; b that I can recall. People die and shit but thats in all religious text. They kill each other over religion and land and dumb shit like everyone else.

       No I would use a youtube video to counter you, unless of course I thought it was so well made, detailed and sourced it covered the information as perfectly as any other site, paper or book. Youtube videos can be a good source of images, photos and video from events. I remember watching one video, about the nwo or something, and it was full of garbage, even used a clip from the political onion satire videos lol (covered the onion symbol with their own symbol which stamped the whole video). But I did find a really interesting interview regarding American politicians on the middle east. You can always find diamonds in shit.

       It has many references to gentiles and goyim, which im sure you are famaliar with the meaning. Some are as such.
- The penalty for adultery does not include sex with a minor, the wife of a minor or the wife of a heathen[Gentile]
- When a grown up man has intercourse with a little girl it is nothing. For when the girl is less than this [3 Years and a day] it is as if one puts the finger into the eye. (The foot note of this passage also states: As tears come to the eye again and again. So does virginity come back to the girl under three years) Talmund Kethuboth 11b
- • Only Jews are human. Gentiles are animals. Baba Mezia 114a-114b
- • For murder, whether of a Cuthean [Gentile] by a Cuthean, or of an Israelite by a Cuthean, punishment is incurred; but of a Cuthean by an Israelite, there is no death penalty. Sanhedrin 57a
- If a Jew is tempted to do evil he should go to a city where he is not known and do the evil there. Moed Kattan 17a.
- Goyims flesh is as the flesh of asses and whose issue is like the issue of horses. (Imagine if I said black or jews or asains were comprable to horses. Outrage.)
- If a heathen [Gentile] hits a Jew, the Gentile must be killed. Sanhedrin 58b.
- What a Jew obtains by theft from a Cuthean [Gentile] he may keep. Sanhedrin 57a.
- [Gentiles] are outside the protection of the law and God has ‘exposed their money to Israel.’ Baba Kamma 37b
- All [Gentile] children are animals. Yebamoth 98a.
- “Tob shebe-goyim harog” — “The best of the Goyim is to be killed.[The best of snakes ought to have its head crushed]” Soferim 15
      </p>
      <p>
       Those kinds of saying have a recouring theme throughout. A gentile/goyim/heathen is not considered a man by jewish definition, therefore laws such as the commandments do not apply to non-jews.
      </p>
      <p>
       The jewish religion is more embeded in supremecy than the nazi party ever was. The whole concept of their religion is that they are like gods amongst us. It is comparable to humans and animals. except it is Jews, then us and animals are equally below them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yeah I mean all religions have a history of violence Im not picking on the jews as the only religion to commit evil acts. But there is a reason jews have been kicked out of countrys 109 times. Its their constant parasitic desire to control. They are fiends who bring systems of debt and slavery everywhere they go and these systems feed their own power and wealth. They use methods of propaganda constantly, always twisting whatever they can to suit their purpose. Its not a concidence everywhere they go they end up in the high positions of power and influence, and that wherever they have positions of power chaos, death and poverty follow.
      </p>
      <p>
       If your interested in researching what I am saying and finding out more for yourself, forming your own opinion compared to what you already know, the best place to start is Martin Luther, Jews and their lies, written in 1543. Here was a man said to be sympathetic to the jews but after reading the talmund he denounced them as evil and vengful because of what he read there. And before you say I am using one book to justify everything I say its just a good starting place historically, you can work up from there yourself if you are interested in finding out more, either to reinforce your own views or to perhaps change them.
      </p>
      <p>
       The racism is there because supremecy is racism. White supremecy is racism, Jewish supremecy is racism.

       That is to take a very literal reading of the text, which is fine if you so wish. I would argue it is likely that the majority of people who follow most religions do not take the text literally.
      </p>
      <p>
       My issue is you just cherry pick what you like and don't like from the religious text to support your view. I can do the same for nearly every other religion if I have a point to look at. You have to look at things as a whole.

       I could use "humans" instead of jews in that paragraph and it makes sense as well. Which to me indicates human nature could be to blame if you were to look at history of people as an aggregate and the crap we do to each other.

        the best place to start is Martin Luther, Jews and their lies, written in 1543. Here was a man said to be sympathetic to the jews but after reading the talmund he denounced them as evil and vengful because of what he read there.

       I haven't read that book. I do believe that because it was written in 1543 it is possible that Martin Luther was prone to a more conservative and literal reading of religious texts though. Which isn't me attempting to disregard his conclusions but merely offer the idea that as it went on the mainstream interpretation of the texts changed, as with other religions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, can you clarify if you believe that the majority of jews are somehow complicit in this idea, or that it is a select few people who are jewish? (rothschild, pick your poison, etc)

        That is to take a very literal reading of the text, which is fine if you so wish. I would argue it is likely that the majority of people who follow most religions do not take the text literally.
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       The quotes I have shared are pretty direct, thats why they are some of the ones I used. They are not poems or riddles, they are instructions and teachings. If you do not take your religious books seriously, you are not really religious by your religions standards, therefore your not one of the jewish people I am worried about.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        I could use "humans" instead of jews in that paragraph and it makes sense as well
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       I don't understand where you are coming from here. You can switch out jews with humans and it would make no difference to the text, that is kind of the whole point. Jews view themselves as people[humans] us as animals. Atleast Talmund jews do.

       Of course not every jew is complicit. Without the ability to read minds on a global scale no one could truely know the extent of true jews/zionists/religious jews/occult jews, whatever you personally refer to them as. But when I was in my teens I had a group of friends, one of them was jewish. He had the jew look but bright ginger hair, he smoked weed, drank alcohol, ate forbidden food. He was circumsized, he prayed, attended religious events etc... I doubt very much he would grow up to try and install dictatorships, communism, banking sytems and spread lies through owned media. He was a casual jew at best. Im sure there are many like him give or take some bad habits.

       Okay but what makes jews special when there is similar garbage in other religious texts though-- are those to be taken with the same weight?

       Your implication that I am jewish is strange as well, as I am not.

       Well I have read the christian bible multiple times. It contains nothing close to the taldum. Not that it is perfect, nor am i a christian, but it is on the other end of the spectrum from jewish scripture. The koran is something I intend to look into further but Im busy researching other stuff at the moment. I don't like to cross over research unless it relates to the orginal research. The jewish religion scarily can be seen in the actions of prominent jews, and probably less prominent jews who are not in the spotlight to scrutinize. Their actions mirror the taldum logic.

       Oh of course evil isn't just a product of the jews. But the jews have orchestrated both world wars, they have completely destroyed the economy and, like a leech, they are stuck to the side constantly growing. Whilst private banks, jewish banks, are operating economies won't evolve or expand, neither will debt ever decrease.

       You can't, not with the majority. The minority however you will easily find within the banks, the media, hollywood, politics, lobbies etc... True Jews are not peaceful people, they are vengeful and believe themselves above others, believe themselves entitled, by religious right, to the property, wealth and labour of others.
How many times does a sect, group or race have to commit the same horrors before you can finally step in and stop them.

       And how do you know it is the real story. You have jews telling you about their experiences in the gas chambers I have jews saying the gas chambers are a hoax. You have jews saying how awful the camps were I have seen jews saying it was alot better than expected.

       we here with ya brother.  im just looking into this.  the REASON i am has nothing to do with ww2 itself.  I am just noticing so many parallels to what has happened in history to whatis going on today.  Right away in my head I asked myself " was hitler just defending his country from a zionist govt?" this thought sprang into my head organically as far as i am concerned.  This to me is an important point.  i noticed what is happening around me and went back to history to see if there is some cycle we are repearing and if so, why? the guy responding to you just takes the MSM version of history and decides its correct.  its plain to see there are those perpetuating a cycle of war and manipulation and if you just want to accept what you have been told that is up to you.  to try to smother any other idea other than what you believe makes you a bigot and your actually hurting your own argument.  If the official version is so sound and unquestionable let it stand on its own.  the fact that your in here defending the official version tells me it isnt as cut and dry as its made out to be and only makes me ask more questions.

       I haven't followed conspiracy for a little while now so I forget alot of the links, I can remember a good video that shows the other side of WW2, the sick things done by the west. The woman who narrates it is obviously abit biased as you will see from the anger in her voice, but you can't really blame her once you see the other side.
