    <div class="md"><p>ISP&#39;s are not going to be selling internet histories with names attached.  The consumer backlash would be out of this world.  They simply could not do that from a business perspective. Who here would stay with their ISP if anyone could buy their internet history with name attached?  Customer losses and bad PR would greatly outweigh any profits from the new avenue of business.  </p>

<p>If anything, it will be something like history for: 35 year old male, 94526 zip code, single family home.  </p>

<p>This is stupid.  Just because the government doesn&#39;t ban something doesn&#39;t mean that a company will do it.  Market forces will regulate activity.  Businesses will only do with consumers allow them to.  Speak with your wallet, not with  a gun.  </p>

<p>I guarantee if one tries to sell customer information with names attached, their subscriber numbers plummet and they rethink that move.  It would be a colossal error from a business of profit maximizing perspective.    </p>

<p>But ultimately, I don&#39;t use Facebook because I don&#39;t like the invasion of privacy.  I&#39;m &quot;voting&quot; with my wallet.  The relationship between Facebook and their customers is between them, it&#39;s not the government&#39;s business.  That&#39;s freedom.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re wrong on several points.</p>

<p>1) If <em>everyone</em> is using FB (which is almost true) you have much less of an option about it because you will be a social outcast if you do not. (remember that everyone is different, you&#39;re mileage may vary)</p>

<p>2) It&#39;s not about ads. There are companies that hook directly into facebook and which can read your profile (what you click on etc.). This is because FB is a platform,  in FBs younger days you used to run all kinds of &#39;apps&#39; on your FB page, but they then changed to focus more on the feed, however those app&#39;s are still active. You can go in manually and remove them but you need to <em>know how that is done</em>. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The bill removes laws that ban them from selling customer browsing information.  It does not mean that they necessarily will sell it.  Policies will likely vary by company.  </p>

<p>Every ISP customer has a contract with the ISP regarding the terms of service, called the Terms and Conditions.  If an ISP planned to start selling this information, they would have to revise the TC.  All customers would have to be notified of any changes.  If you don&#39;t like the changes, you can leave.  So yes, the public would know about the plan when it&#39;s close to implementation.  </p>

<p>If customers actually care about this, they will cancel service and switch to firms that don&#39;t sell information, or reduce service, such that it is fiscally more profitable to not sell the information.   </p>

</blockquote>

<p>This shows how naive you are to this topic. Im of the opinion, if they can, they will. Its actually why we are having this discussion. They lobbied congress to pass this. You think congress came up with this great idea to sell browsing data?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you don&#39;t like the changes, you can leave.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Leave the internet? Just stop using it? OR go to what other ISP? They are all covered. Lets say you go to one of the smaller companies, and whose more likely to generate needed revenue from a data stream? A big company or a small company? Then we can talk about the QoS using one of the shit tier companies, all because I wanted to speak with a my wallet. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It would constitute a material change in the contractual terms they have with their customers, and thus they must revise the contract (terms and conditions) they have with customers to include it.  All customers would be informed as soon as there is a plan to implement, before changes go into effect.  </p>

<p>If they tried to sell your information without revising the contract, you would have grounds to sue them for breach of contract, and would likely win.  </p>

<p>I&#39;m sure media outlets would pick up the story.  But yes, there is a problem with our legal system when contracts need to be so long, that nobody takes the time to read them anymore.   </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I dont see any downside to prevent them legally from doing this.   </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Freedom and non-agression.  Government regulations are actions coerced at the muzzle of a gun.   </p>

<blockquote>
<p>What is the upside to allowing them? I dont stand to gain anything from them utilizing my data.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you are the type of person who really doesn&#39;t care what the ISP does with your data, then potentially you could choose an ISP that sells that information in exchange for offering cheaper services to you, then there could be a competing firm for those who value privacy more, but are willing to pay higher prices for that privacy.   </p>

<p>In a free market, services can carve out niches to provide maximum value to their customers.   </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Probably not, because many local governments have granted protected monopolies to some ISP&#39;s.  This is an issue in itself that needs to be dealt with.  Competing firms need to be allowed into the market.  Fortunately with 5G wireless internet on the horizon, we will likely see an end to these monopolies very soon, as wireless infrastructure is much cheaper to build out than wiring every home, and 5G services will provide speeds that rival wired.  </p>

<p>This would just add to the huge pile of gossipy personal crap they cover on mainstream outlets. We don&#39;t want to encourage the media to turn the government into a tv show anymore than it already is.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We need to hear more about their policies? I know enough about their policies, because I know that they just voted to let my internet service provider sell my browsing data to anyone who&#39;s willing to pay for it. Shamelessly profiting off of a huge abuse of privacy.</p>

<p>And some of them have campaigns bankrolled by these same ISPs! Let me buy the data on what they were googling late at night. Equal protection under the law and all that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s interesting that these corporate sponsored bills had at least some bipartisan support when the legislature was split. Now with the republican majority they can get unpopular bills passed without destroying Americans faith in government. Just redirect people&#39;s anger towards voting democrat at the mid term rather than our corrupt system. I imagine we&#39;ll see more votes where democrats will vote in a block to save credibility. That way they&#39;ll be able to point to their record when the pitchforks and torches come out. </p>

<p>All the while the same policies the elite want introduced will be.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Adam McElhaney actor. He&#39;s no privacy advocate and this campaign is B.S. I don&#39;t think he&#39;s being intentionally dishonest, but he doesn&#39;t have an idea of what he&#39;s talking about. There is no plan. Read his updates, he&#39;s spitballing. He&#39;s already collected 50k. Don&#39;t give him more money. </p>
