       ISP's are not going to be selling internet histories with names attached.  The consumer backlash would be out of this world.  They simply could not do that from a business perspective. Who here would stay with their ISP if anyone could buy their internet history with name attached?  Customer losses and bad PR would greatly outweigh any profits from the new avenue of business.

       If anything, it will be something like history for: 35 year old male, 94526 zip code, single family home.

       This is stupid.  Just because the government doesn't ban something doesn't mean that a company will do it.  Market forces will regulate activity.  Businesses will only do with consumers allow them to.  Speak with your wallet, not with  a gun.

       How could you possibly have tried anything if no ISP has unveiled a business plan to sell browsing history yet?  The bill removing the ban hasn't even been signed into law yet.
      </p>
      <p>
       I guarantee if one tries to sell customer information with names attached, their subscriber numbers plummet and they rethink that move.  It would be a colossal error from a business of profit maximizing perspective.

       It's already possible on facebook. Companies are profiling people and selling their history, name attached, to insurrance companies who then base their specific individual premiums on that profile.

       Except with Facebook all you have to do is click a button to opt out, and you will be served generic ads instead.  Furthermore, if you don't opt out, they serve you ads based on your activity, they don't provide a log of your activity to the advertisers.
      </p>
      <p>
       But ultimately, I don't use Facebook because I don't like the invasion of privacy.  I'm "voting" with my wallet.  The relationship between Facebook and their customers is between them, it's not the government's business.  That's freedom.

       You're wrong on several points.
      </p>
      <p>
       1) If
       <em>
        everyone
       </em>
       is using FB (which is almost true) you have much less of an option about it because you will be a social outcast if you do not. (remember that everyone is different, you're mileage may vary)
      </p>
      <p>
       2) It's not about ads. There are companies that hook directly into facebook and which can read your profile (what you click on etc.). This is because FB is a platform,  in FBs younger days you used to run all kinds of 'apps' on your FB page, but they then changed to focus more on the feed, however those app's are still active. You can go in manually and remove them but you need to
       <em>
        know how that is done
       </em>
       .

       Would we the public absolutely know about this business model if it were to happen? I am not familiar with the legalese of the bill. Scary thought that ISPS could sell information to insurance companies about individual's browsing history etc.

       The bill removes laws that ban them from selling customer browsing information.  It does not mean that they necessarily will sell it.  Policies will likely vary by company.
      </p>
      <p>
       Every ISP customer has a contract with the ISP regarding the terms of service, called the Terms and Conditions.  If an ISP planned to start selling this information, they would have to revise the TC.  All customers would have to be notified of any changes.  If you don't like the changes, you can leave.  So yes, the public would know about the plan when it's close to implementation.
      </p>
      <p>
       If customers actually care about this, they will cancel service and switch to firms that don't sell information, or reduce service, such that it is fiscally more profitable to not sell the information.

       This shows how naive you are to this topic. Im of the opinion, if they can, they will. Its actually why we are having this discussion. They lobbied congress to pass this. You think congress came up with this great idea to sell browsing data?

       Leave the internet? Just stop using it? OR go to what other ISP? They are all covered. Lets say you go to one of the smaller companies, and whose more likely to generate needed revenue from a data stream? A big company or a small company? Then we can talk about the QoS using one of the shit tier companies, all because I wanted to speak with a my wallet.

       It would constitute a material change in the contractual terms they have with their customers, and thus they must revise the contract (terms and conditions) they have with customers to include it.  All customers would be informed as soon as there is a plan to implement, before changes go into effect.
      </p>
      <p>
       If they tried to sell your information without revising the contract, you would have grounds to sue them for breach of contract, and would likely win.

       Right, so youd get an email that says your privacy policy has been updated, click to read, which 90% of people will just ignore.

       I dont see any downside to prevent them legally from doing this. What is the upside to allowing them? I dont stand to gain anything from them utilizing my data. Will my bill decrease now that they are monetizing my data? Unlikely.

       You speak of using your wallet to talk, in most areas, you are severely limited by what ISP you are able to use. Where I am at, to get internet, I have Verizon or Comcast.

       I'm sure media outlets would pick up the story.  But yes, there is a problem with our legal system when contracts need to be so long, that nobody takes the time to read them anymore.

       Freedom and non-agression.  Government regulations are actions coerced at the muzzle of a gun.

       If you are the type of person who really doesn't care what the ISP does with your data, then potentially you could choose an ISP that sells that information in exchange for offering cheaper services to you, then there could be a competing firm for those who value privacy more, but are willing to pay higher prices for that privacy.

      <p>
       In a free market, services can carve out niches to provide maximum value to their customers.

        Will my bill decrease now that they are monetizing my data? Unlikely.

        You speak of using your wallet to talk, in most areas, you are severely limited by what ISP you are able to use. Where I am at, to get internet, I have Verizon or Comcast.

       Probably not, because many local governments have granted protected monopolies to some ISP's.  This is an issue in itself that needs to be dealt with.  Competing firms need to be allowed into the market.  Fortunately with 5G wireless internet on the horizon, we will likely see an end to these monopolies very soon, as wireless infrastructure is much cheaper to build out than wiring every home, and 5G services will provide speeds that rival wired.

       Theres alot of people who dont like their ISP already but are forced to stay with it or not have internet because its the only one in their area.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most people dont know they even care about privacy, half the people i mention this to say they dont care because they have nothing to hide.
      </p>
      <p>
       A majority of internet users dont give a crap about what their ISP does with their data, as long as facebook and youtube load before they get bored and switch back to their phones.

       It's interesting that these corporate sponsored bills had at least some bipartisan support when the legislature was split. Now with the republican majority they can get unpopular bills passed without destroying Americans faith in government. Just redirect people's anger towards voting democrat at the mid term rather than our corrupt system. I imagine we'll see more votes where democrats will vote in a block to save credibility. That way they'll be able to point to their record when the pitchforks and torches come out.

       Adam McElhaney actor. He's no privacy advocate and this campaign is B.S. I don't think he's being intentionally dishonest, but he doesn't have an idea of what he's talking about. There is no plan. Read his updates, he's spitballing. He's already collected 50k. Don't give him more money.
