       Are you at all abashed that your first and key piece of evidence, a guy in a l'enfant t-shirt, has been so easily explained?
       <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Charles_L'Enfant">
        L',enfant

       is a major revolutionary war figure and was the chief designer of Washington DC. A lot of stuff, including a popular nightclub are named after him. That t-shirt is from that club.

       That isn't even my key piece of evidence at all. It even supports the deranged theory that there are tunnels under DC. If he's the chief designer of Washington DC, does it not raise suspicion at all that he could be in close with Alefantis, plotting?

       If you truly believe Alefantis is completely innocent and this was all a matter of internet conspiracy theorists making propaganda against democrats blindly I really do envy you. I wish to believe that. But for fuck sakes Ted Gunderson has openely stated whats going on in regards to the illuminati, human sacrifice and child trafficking. Why do you think he suspiciously died after? Is there any evidence that leads you to believe he is up to absoloutely nothing and is innocent of all claims made against him?

       Anyone that legitimately questioned the associations and actions of those surrounding the podestas and alefantis are now tainted with your idiocy.  I really hope you are getting paid well, because if there are (and there probably are) children that could have been saved by looking into alefantis, the failure of an investigation lies on useful idiots like yourself.

       I respect your response. I'll have you know I WISH I was getting payed to write this shit. The fact you believe I am any type of "shill" just justifies your belief in things more absurd or equal to what I believe. And my beliefs are supported by circumstanstial evidence. Your beliefs are behind refuting said evidence. Shillmaster Keag4n, out.

       Many people have submitted various evidence to the FBI but two things tell me they don't want to mess with this. One, the FBI is the biggest disseminator of CP on the internet, themselves and two, Comey has shown himself to not be interested in much other than protecting himself from getting caught on the losing side.
      </p>
      <p>
       At any rate, we have yet to see any definitive evidence that the FBI is responding to reports that have been given to them.

       There isn't. I've asked for evidence over and over and over, and I've never received anything other than "YOU'RE A SHILL" or "YOU'RE A PEDO SYMPATHIZER". Seriously, if you have info on witnesses, victims, physical evidence, etc. let me know.

       If you really want to get into it do the work yourself, but to say there is no evidence just proves you are glossing over it. Evidence isn't always explicit, sometimes it's implicit. Use context, connect the dots yourself, and you will see the obviousness of what is going on.

       On the validity of circumstantial evidence:
      </p>
      <p>
       A popular misconception is that circumstantial evidence is less valid or less important than direct evidence. This is only partly true: direct evidence is popularly, but mistakenly, considered more powerful. Many successful criminal prosecutions rely largely or entirely on circumstantial evidence, and civil charges are frequently based on circumstantial or indirect evidence. Much of the evidence against convicted American bomber Timothy McVeigh was circumstantial, for example. Speaking about McVeigh's trial, University of Michigan law professor Robert Precht said, "Circumstantial evidence can be, and often is much more powerful than direct evidence." The 2004 murder trial of Scott Peterson was another high-profile conviction based heavily on circumstantial evidence.

       You got BTFO on your very first piece of evidence and your response is "HUMAN TRAFFICKING IS REAL SO MY LOGIC IS SOUND". Rather than hysterically pointing at "innocent, loving children", try critical, fact-based reasoning.

       Exact same point holds here. The existence of unfounded questions, to which you won't accept an answer anyway, doesn't make the pizzagate fantasy real. It just shows that you and your voat friendos suffer from an excess of free time and hate for Hillary.

       If #pizzagate ever gets past wild conjecture stage, then I'm all for investigating and prosecuting whomever to the fullest extent of the law. Til then, it still smells like political witchhunt meme.

       Otherwise, if you care to take a serious look at what's actually already passed the stink test regarding child trafficking among the elite and is currently winding its way through the courts, then keep your eye on the upcoming depositions in the Virginia Roberts-Giuffre lawsuit against Ghislaine Maxwell scheduled for May 15th.

       Agent Orange is a foreign asset, but your narrative keeps calling out the wrong nation as owner (which is a fatal flaw in the proceedings). Maxwell and Epstein belong to whom??? (hint: same owners). DNC servers (and email accts) were, in reality, a free-for-all in foreign surveillance. Red-led house committee will end up digging out whistle-blowers for "illegal dissemination" and unethical masking of names in intelligence reports. In order to create plausible deniability for the Russian hacking claims, House committee will bring in the Congressional Police investigation of Pakistani ISI affiliated IT personnel ("Awan Brothers"). This will expose various types of trafficking associated with topples of foreign governments (like "successful" ones in Libya and Ukraine) and especially the failed coup in Turkey. Flynn's early resignation makes his work for Erdogan admissible in the investigation (without incriminating his work at trying to hand over Gulen, who will be branded a drug/arms/human trafficker and terrorist).
      </p>
      <p>
       The bigger picture is that the "deep state war" is between the forces of Zionism and Globalism. Zionists have the Globalists checkmated through use of Brownstone-like blackmail operations (Zio politicians are checkmated, too - but it enforces their support). I predict that there will be many arrests (nobody
       <em>
        too
       </em>
       high profile, though - top levels will probably just die off of "natural causes"). In all, this will have the look of a partisan purge, which I think sets a very bad precedent for our country. Anyhow, I know that you are not wrong to be suspicious of Orange One. I just wanted to share who I think the real owners are and why your narrative is doomed to fail (or really, to backfire and completely destroy DNC credibility in the near term). I think that DNC knows this to some extent, which is why they just fired all of their staffers. I predict that this process will take about 2 years to play out, which will only help your opposite partisans. Does this sound possible/probable to you?

       why not check with a 3rd party investigation then? If they have nothing to hide then it shouldn't be a problem right?

       Check the building ownership and permits of all the suspected businesses (pizza, ping pong, shipping warehouses and containers). Start checking in on Alefantis'/Tony Podesta's whereabouts, who they mingle with and correspond with, how often they frequent those places, etc. Detectives do this type of shit without warrants all the time to regular people, why not them?
      </p>
      <p>
       Then from there, see if there are any other coincidences with that information that lead to anything suspect in terms of pedophilia or trafficking.

       If you respect his answer then change your post. To his defense, your post is claiming the shirt represents something that it does not.
      </p>
      <p>
       The shirt is something, but it's not what you claim it is up top. Do some research on Pierre Charles L'Enfant and you'll find he's the designer of the Washington Monument (Phallic building), layout of DC (pentagrams), and other suspecting areas. There is something to this guy that dates back to secret societies and the founding of the U.S. And who knows, maybe the cafe created with his name is up to no good either.
      </p>
      <p>
       But when you have small bits of information incorrect in your findings it opens you up to shilling, and can discredit your overall post.

       Hey man thanks for the response. I understand now where the shirt comes from. It still doesn't add up to him saying he hates children. Why post that on your instagram? To me it seems even more fishy that he has ties to the guy who builds things around DC.

       Do you realize that guy in the picture with the shirt  is not even Alefantis, doesn't even look like him. It's Christopher Lynch, co-owner of L'Enfant cafe. Is it weird to wear your own business attire at your own reastuant.

       Sure. Link me to any kind of pedophile, and my involvement with them in any way. I'd be happy to take a lie detector test. I'd be happy to attest to any rumors directed at me, no matter how harsh they are.

       I don't fetishize infants on my social media. I don't post nude photos or people covered in blood advertising my restaurant. I do not post pictures of kill rooms. I don't have DIRECT links to high profile members of politics, involved in pedophilia cases.

       EDIT: At the very least, it wouldn't mean he's guilty, it would mean it would be evidence enough to warrant a REAL investigation, which hasn't happened.

       Why doesn't Alefantis DIRECTLY address the CONTROVERSIAL issues at hand on live TV, instead of brushing it off as fake news? (Fake news which coincidentally skyrocketed when pizzagate blew up)

       I remember seeing either here, or VOAT, someone who claimed to be a lawyer stated it would be evidence enough to warrant an investigation. I apologize if I am incorrect. Maybe someone could fact check or maybe someone seeing this comment can confirm either you or I is correct?

       <strong>
        "legitimate lawyers

       No there isn't. I made a mistake in wording and phrasing. I apologize if that has offended you. I do remember seeing someone claiming to be a legit lawyer either here or on voat. I am sorry if my memory is playing tricks. I personally believe there is enough circumstantial evidence to warrant an investigation, not only him but Podesta, as well as the Clintons. I mean, fuck, we all know about Bill and the Lolita.

       It's like they're attempting to use the internet lingo or type of speech they
       <em>
        think
       </em>
       will let them blend in to the fold here, but it's just awkward and obvious. I hope they don't pay these guys shit, because that's the results they're getting with these shills. Maybe it's a straight up bot, but who knows?

       You've been on this sub since the election right? I remember when they first claimed that Russia hacked the election and NOBODY on this sub bought that story. Now it seems like a sizable amount of users here believe in the Russia propaganda which is funny since this is a CONSPIRACY sub that's gives you reasons not to believe msm and politicians. I'll admit that I supported Trump in the election but only because he wasent Hillary Clinton

       The MSM is enemy number 1 here. The recent confidence in the MSM on this sub is troubling and should be cause of suspicion of the users credibility. Skepticism should be standard here and just rolling with the narrative produced by the MSM is going to out the tourists.

       I know, shit like that...and there has been extensive arguments by fools or shills about how this is obviously just a coincidental mistranslation. But I do not fuckin buy it one bit. With all of the other tongue in cheek references these motherfuckers have all over the place, it is obvious that innuendo like this is their MO.

       My theory is that he has been an agent from birth. You know how kids that were abused usually abused too, so it would make sense that he has been an abused kid by the elites and then placed as a agent to handle the kids later in life and given this name as a child by the f*****-up satanic pedophiles

You're always the first one into these PG threads, defending these people, long before the "internet research" actually happened.

       I don't think I've said either of those. I did say that I don't think John Podesta is a "creepy little fucker", and I thought the reasons you offered up for Podesta being creepy were not convincing.

       <strong>
        lead off

       with "it's you again", just as I had done in our previous discussions of your defense of pedophiles such as the one

       .  Pretty much a weekly thing between you and I, even though you pretend otherwise.  And yes, you linked the discussion I'm referring to.  The one anybody can go read and see you defending exactly what I said.  Just because you try to obfuscate it within a wall of text doesn't mean it didn't happen.  So yeah, you defend Alefantis, and you defend Podesta, at every turn.  Right there it is.
      </p>
      <p>
       As far as your account, you say weeks, but the post history says FOUR YEARS.  While there are "weeks" within FOUR YEARS, it's pretty shitty of you to think
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy

       would just let that obvious WORD SMITHING mean anything other than you attempting to deceive.

        "didn't notice" is a lie because I lead off with "it's you again", just as I had done in our previous discussions of your defense of pedophiles such as the one here, or here. Pretty much a weekly thing between you and I, even though you pretend otherwise.
       </p>

      <p>
       No, really, my memory is not that great, I guess. I've gotten lots of similar "oh, you again" comments over the years.

        And yes, you linked the discussion I'm referring to. The one anybody can go read and see you defending exactly what I said. Just because you try to obfuscate it within a wall of text doesn't mean it didn't happen.

       I've never denied that. I think this pizzagate witch hunt is the most disturbing thing that's every happened on reddit, even topping the whole Sandy Hook denial. I saw a performance of
       <em>
        The Crucible
       </em>
       last October, then just weeks later it happened right before my eyes. It's just stunning how easily led some people are and how gullible. And the things that people consider evidence,
       <em>
        holy shit
       </em>
       ! I can't believe that James Woods still thinks that "walnut sauce" is anything other than food!

      <blockquote>

        As far as your account, you say weeks, but the post history says FOUR YEARS. While there are "weeks" within FOUR YEARS, it's pretty shitty of you to think
        <a href="/r/conspiracy">
         /r/conspiracy

        would just let that obvious WORD SMITHING mean anything other than you attempting to deceive.

       I'm sorry if I wasn't clear. I used the twsmith account for a few weeks at the beginning (well, a few months now that I look at it). Then I stopped using it until my main account was banned. Yes, that was four years.
      </p>

       So what? How does that affect the substance of what I say?

       What does having a verified email address have to do with anything? I just checked and 8 out of the 10 moderators here have  verified email addresses.

      <p>
       Yes, I defend
       <em>
        accused
       </em>
       pedophiles. People who are almost certainly innocent and have been accused by people they've never met, based on evidence that spans the range from the fraudulent to the bizarre. Clearly, since I've been here since
       <em>
        before
       </em>
       pizzagate, that's not all I'm here for. Anybody can look at my comments and see that it's not the only thing I comment about.
      </p>
      <p>
       My comments are in reaction to what's posted here. If people post stupid things about pizzagate, I'll respond to them if I have the time.

       I would try to clarify for you again about this account, but I think that I've already done it for anybody that actually reads what I wrote. But more importantly,
       <em>
        what the fuck does it matter
       </em>
       ?
      </p>
      <p>
       I could easily write a wall of text about whether the Rothschilds own central banks, if you really want me to. But, instead, here's an exercise. Suppose you found a piece of paper on the ground with two statements:
      </p>
      <p>
       A. All but 3 of the central banks in the world are owned by the Rothschilds.
       <br/>
       B. There are no Rothschild-controlled banks in the world. It is a hoax.
      </p>
      <p>
       How would you go about determining whether statement A is true or statement B is true or the truth is somewhere in between?
      </p>
      <p>
       Since you just found these on the ground, you can't whether the statement A was written by someone with a verified email address account on reddit, or by someone whose account is only 3 days old.
      </p>
      <p>
       Tell me, what would you do in this situation?

       Why are you conflating two different issues? The British media coverup of Jimmy Saville was a massive scandal but has nothing to do with the internet allegation against the DC pizza shops.
      </p>
      <p>
       Four pictures:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        The guy owned a restaurant called "L'Enfants" so he's wearing a shirt declaring his love for his own restaurant. "L'Enfant" is a name, you're mixing it up with "
        <em>
         Les
        </em>
        enfants" which means "the children".
       </li>
       <li>
        Those two people had a business relationship. I believe that Podesta used his pizza shop as a fundraiser. So what?
       </li>
       <li>
        Everyone in the British media was either duped by Jimmy Saville or actively involved in covering up his crimes. There is no evidence that the government was involved in the cover ups. Certainly not at a high level.
       </li>
       <li>
        As far as Prince Charles knew, Saville was just a popular celebrity children's entertainer.
       </li>
      </ol>

       Why was Saville, Charles, and Thomas Hamilton hanging out and laughing? Saville was with Charles a lot. Just watching the documentary on Saville you can tell he's a psychopath. I'm sure PC knew.

       Oh, you're sure he knew. Guess that's all the proof we need that the scandal went to the top! And that proves that a random DC pizza restaurant is some sort of child trafficking center how exactly?

       They both live in Washington, D.C. and are both involved in the local art scene as well as Democratic Party politics. Alefantis used to own an art gallery and is president of the Transformer artist's organization in DC. Tony Podesta is a major art collector and has hosted

        Transformer events at his house

       . Also, Alefantis used to be the boyfriend of David Brock, who is very connected to Democratic Party politics.

       Don't fall for the trap of only focusing on alefantis and comet pizza. The clinton foundation is the meat and taters of the whole revelations. The human trafficking in haiti along with the selling of our guarded secrets. All the way up to SAP level programs. While alefantis is most likely guilty. I doubt he is anything more than 1 place where they go to have their pedophile parties.

So yeah, you defend Alefantis, and you defend Podesta, at every turn.  Right there it is.

       I would try to clarify for you again about this account, but I think that I've already done it for anybody that actually reads what I wrote. But more importantly,

      <p>
       I could easily write a wall of text about whether the Rothschilds own central banks, if you really want me to. But, instead, here's an exercise. Suppose you found a piece of paper on the ground with two statements:
      </p>
      <p>
       A. All but 3 of the central banks in the world are owned by the Rothschilds.
       <br/>
       B. There are no Rothschild-controlled banks in the world. It is a hoax.
      </p>
      <p>
       How would you go about determining whether statement A is true or statement B is true or the truth is somewhere in between?
      </p>
      <p>
       Since you just found these on the ground, you can't whether the statement A was written by someone with a verified email address account on reddit, or by someone whose account is only 3 days old.
      </p>
      <p>
       Tell me, what would you do in this situation?
