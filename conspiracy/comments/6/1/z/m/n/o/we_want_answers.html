I wish to believe that. But for fuck sakes Ted Gunderson has openely stated whats going on in regards to the illuminati, human sacrifice and child trafficking.

<p>That said, according to this kind of loony logic, one could also deduce that anyone wearing a &quot;I ❤ U.S. Army <strong>Infant</strong>ry&quot; t-shirt is also an infant-loving pedophile, no? Do you not see your self-induced hysteria, yet?</p>

<p>If you really want to get into it do the work yourself, but to say there is no evidence just proves you are glossing over it. Evidence isn&#39;t always explicit, sometimes it&#39;s implicit. Use context, connect the dots yourself, and you will see the obviousness of what is going on.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>On the validity of circumstantial evidence:</p>

<p>A popular misconception is that circumstantial evidence is less valid or less important than direct evidence. This is only partly true: direct evidence is popularly, but mistakenly, considered more powerful. Many successful criminal prosecutions rely largely or entirely on circumstantial evidence, and civil charges are frequently based on circumstantial or indirect evidence. Much of the evidence against convicted American bomber Timothy McVeigh was circumstantial, for example. Speaking about McVeigh&#39;s trial, University of Michigan law professor Robert Precht said, &quot;Circumstantial evidence can be, and often is much more powerful than direct evidence.&quot; The 2004 murder trial of Scott Peterson was another high-profile conviction based heavily on circumstantial evidence.</p>

<p>You got BTFO on your very first piece of evidence and your response is &quot;HUMAN TRAFFICKING IS REAL SO MY LOGIC IS SOUND&quot;. Rather than hysterically pointing at &quot;innocent, loving children&quot;, try critical, fact-based reasoning.</p>

<p>That&#39;s the problem with #pizzagate -- if the Hillary connection hadn&#39;t been invented, nobody would even be talking about this. And it all devolves into &quot;WHY DONT YOU CARE ABOUT TRAFFICKING OF CHILDREN??&quot;</p>

<p>No my friend. If the Hillary connection hadn&#39;t been invented, nobody would feel the need to read pedophilia into the fact that a family restaurant with ping pong tables calls itself &quot;kid friendly&quot;.</p>

<p>A destroyed computer isn&#39;t evidence of wrongdoing. Given your obsession with this silly fantasy, you might read wrongdoing into it. But that says more about your biased perspective than about the veracity of this &quot;conspiracy&quot;.</p>

<p>Exact same point holds here. The existence of unfounded questions, to which you won&#39;t accept an answer anyway, doesn&#39;t make the pizzagate fantasy real. It just shows that you and your voat friendos suffer from an excess of free time and hate for Hillary.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First of all, &quot;loony&quot; is not a personal attack on you, but #pizzagators in general. The so-called &quot;evidence&quot; just doesn&#39;t get past go. In fact, it <strong>screams</strong> political and religiously-inspired witchhunt against Democrats and anyone else who doesn&#39;t conform to conservative norms (i.e., homosexuals or people who like deviant art).</p>

<p>That said, who in their right mind doesn&#39;t detest human trafficking or doesn&#39;t loathe child molesters? Further, insinuating that child molestation is more prevalent among the elite is pure conjecture at best. In fact, I&#39;m pretty sure it&#39;s much more common among families of all classes, if anyone.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agent Orange is a foreign asset, but your narrative keeps calling out the wrong nation as owner (which is a fatal flaw in the proceedings). Maxwell and Epstein belong to whom??? (hint: same owners). DNC servers (and email accts) were, in reality, a free-for-all in foreign surveillance. Red-led house committee will end up digging out whistle-blowers for &quot;illegal dissemination&quot; and unethical masking of names in intelligence reports. In order to create plausible deniability for the Russian hacking claims, House committee will bring in the Congressional Police investigation of Pakistani ISI affiliated IT personnel (&quot;Awan Brothers&quot;). This will expose various types of trafficking associated with topples of foreign governments (like &quot;successful&quot; ones in Libya and Ukraine) and especially the failed coup in Turkey. Flynn&#39;s early resignation makes his work for Erdogan admissible in the investigation (without incriminating his work at trying to hand over Gulen, who will be branded a drug/arms/human trafficker and terrorist).</p>

<p>The bigger picture is that the &quot;deep state war&quot; is between the forces of Zionism and Globalism. Zionists have the Globalists checkmated through use of Brownstone-like blackmail operations (Zio politicians are checkmated, too - but it enforces their support). I predict that there will be many arrests (nobody <em>too</em> high profile, though - top levels will probably just die off of &quot;natural causes&quot;). In all, this will have the look of a partisan purge, which I think sets a very bad precedent for our country. Anyhow, I know that you are not wrong to be suspicious of Orange One. I just wanted to share who I think the real owners are and why your narrative is doomed to fail (or really, to backfire and completely destroy DNC credibility in the near term). I think that DNC knows this to some extent, which is why they just fired all of their staffers. I predict that this process will take about 2 years to play out, which will only help your opposite partisans. Does this sound possible/probable to you?</p>

<p>The shirt is something, but it&#39;s not what you claim it is up top.

<p>Actually, until you pointed it out, I didn&#39;t notice. I&#39;m much more interested in facts and sources than in who is posting. I find the obsession with who is posting what to be really weird.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You&#39;re always the first one into these PG threads, defending these people, long before the &quot;internet research&quot; actually happened.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t know what you mean. Alefantis&#39;s genealogy was researched back in the first week of November.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Shall I link the history of our dances, and all the super questionable statements you make where you think its NORMAL to talk about killing and butchering at formal dinners</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you&#39;re talking about <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2009/07/john-podesta-a-seasoned-hand-024575">this dinner</a>, he was talking to a food columnist and cookbook author at an &quot;informal Sunday dinner for six&quot;. He was talking to her while cooking: &quot;Interspersed are funny, self-deprecating stories, including tales of his tour of duty as a guide wearing an 18th-century costume that involved slaughtering and roasting pigs.&quot;</p>

<p>As I said in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5wmrb1/hmmmmtony_podesta_is_quoted_once_in_a_2008/decelaf/">our previous conversation</a>, &quot;I&#39;ve never talked to somebody who has slaughtered animals for a living, but I have talked about the subject with some people who have lived on farms and done it. Although the subject is unpleasant, I didn&#39;t find them creepy.&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>NORMAL to put pictures of butchering animals as your background screen saver, NORMAL to have pictures of cannibalism on your office wall (all things you&#39;ve said)? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve said either of those. I did say that I don&#39;t think John Podesta is a &quot;creepy little fucker&quot;, and I thought the reasons you offered up for Podesta being creepy were not convincing.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Shall I link to the statistical analysis of your account, and the others in this thread that statistically match yours? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Go right ahead. This is the only account that I&#39;m using in this thread. I <em>occassionally</em> use another account in this sub when I want to say something really sarcastic or satirical. But that&#39;s less than one comment per month, on average.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t get paid for this and I don&#39;t work with anybody else.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Shall I point out that your account was dead for FOUR YEARS before it suddenly found a use again in defending pedophiles?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As I have said before, I initially set up this account to say more controversial things than I wanted to say with my main account. After a few weeks, I decided that was too much trouble and I just dropped it.</p>

<p>My main account was banned by the reddit admins in the great Sandy Hook ban of Feb. 1, 2014, so I started using this as my main account.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I certainly don&#39;t remember accusing you of being PAID to defend pedophiles, but it&#39;s curious that you would bring that up.  Deflection or Projection... both are good possibilities.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve never denied that. I think this pizzagate witch hunt is the most disturbing thing that&#39;s every happened on reddit, even topping the whole Sandy Hook denial. I saw a performance of <em>The Crucible</em> last October, then just weeks later it happened right before my eyes. It&#39;s just stunning how easily led some people are and how gullible. And the things that people consider evidence, <em>holy shit</em>! I can&#39;t believe that James Woods still thinks that &quot;walnut sauce&quot; is anything other than food!</p>

<p>I&#39;m sorry if I wasn&#39;t clear. I used the twsmith account for a few weeks at the beginning (well, a few months now that I look at it). Then I stopped using it until my main account was banned. Yes, that was four years.</p>

<p>So what? How does that affect the substance of what I say?</p>

<p>What does having a verified email address have to do with anything? I just checked and 8 out of the 10 moderators here have  verified email addresses.</p>

<p>Yes, I defend <em>accused</em> pedophiles. People who are almost certainly innocent and have been accused by people they&#39;ve never met, based on evidence that spans the range from the fraudulent to the bizarre. Clearly, since I&#39;ve been here since <em>before</em> pizzagate, that&#39;s not all I&#39;m here for. Anybody can look at my comments and see that it&#39;s not the only thing I comment about.</p>

<p>My comments are in reaction to what&#39;s posted here. If people post stupid things about pizzagate, I&#39;ll respond to them if I have the time.</p>

<p>I would try to clarify for you again about this account, but I think that I&#39;ve already done it for anybody that actually reads what I wrote. But more importantly, <em>what the fuck does it matter</em>?</p>

<p>I could easily write a wall of text about whether the Rothschilds own central banks, if you really want me to. But, instead, here&#39;s an exercise. Suppose you found a piece of paper on the ground with two statements:</p>

<p>A. All but 3 of the central banks in the world are owned by the Rothschilds.<br/>
B. There are no Rothschild-controlled banks in the world. It is a hoax.</p>

<p>How would you go about determining whether statement A is true or statement B is true or the truth is somewhere in between?</p>

<p>Since you just found these on the ground, you can&#39;t whether the statement A was written by someone with a verified email address account on reddit, or by someone whose account is only 3 days old.</p>

<p>Tell me, what would you do in this situation?</p>

<li>Those two people had a business relationship. I believe that Podesta used his pizza shop as a fundraiser. So what?</li>
<li>Everyone in the British media was either duped by Jimmy Saville or actively involved in covering up his crimes. There is no evidence that the government was involved in the cover ups. Certainly not at a high level. </li>

<p>Yes, Alefantis knows the Podestas. That&#39;s why he was targeted for attack before the election.</p>

<p>How would Alefantis know that? Even if Prince Charles knew that Savile was a pedophile —which there&#39;s no evidence of— what does that have to do with Alefantis?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why is Prince Charles photographed with young children around him playing pingpong on YOUR CPP Facebook page?

<p>They posted lots of ping pong-related pictures.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>WE WANT ANSWERS! DIRECT ANSWERS TO THESE QUESTIONS. WHAT IS THE BACKGROUND?</p>

<p>How do you know Tony Podesta?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They both live in Washington, D.C. and are both involved in the local art scene as well as Democratic Party politics. Alefantis used to own an art gallery and is president of the Transformer artist&#39;s organization in DC. Tony Podesta is a major art collector and has hosted <a href="https://washingtonlife.smugmug.com/2010-Photos/Transformer-Collectors-View-IV/">Transformer events at his house</a>. Also, Alefantis used to be the boyfriend of David Brock, who is very connected to Democratic Party politics.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>How do you know Prince Charles?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s very doubtful that he knows Prince Charles. The ping pong photo is from Agence France Presse, taken in <a href="http://www.gettyimages.com/license/3012866">England in 2004.</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Aren&#39;t you just a lousy pizza shop owner? How do you know so many influential people with DIRECT ties to pedophilia and human trafficking?</p>

<p>Curious about Clinton foundation trafficking and Dyncorp? Watch george webb series on youtube. He outlines it all with real evidence. And a bit of connecting the dots to show what is really going on in the middle east.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;didn&#39;t notice&quot; is a lie because I <strong>lead off</strong> with &quot;it&#39;s you again&quot;, just as I had done in our previous discussions of your defense of pedophiles such as the one <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5wmrb1/hmmmmtony_podesta_is_quoted_once_in_a_2008/dec26at/">here,</a> or <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5us52n/just_a_reminder_john_podesta_was_hillarys_pick/ddwyrmz/">here</a>.  Pretty much a weekly thing between you and I, even though you pretend otherwise.  And yes, you linked the discussion I&#39;m referring to.  The one anybody can go read and see you defending exactly what I said.  Just because you try to obfuscate it within a wall of text doesn&#39;t mean it didn&#39;t happen.  So yeah, you defend Alefantis, and you defend Podesta, at every turn.  Right there it is.  </p>

<p>As far as your account, you say weeks, but the post history says FOUR YEARS.  While there are &quot;weeks&quot; within FOUR YEARS, it&#39;s pretty shitty of you to think <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> would just let that obvious WORD SMITHING mean anything other than you attempting to deceive.  </p>

<p>I certainly don&#39;t remember accusing you of being PAID to defend pedophiles, but it&#39;s curious that you would bring that up.  Deflection or Projection... both are good possibilities.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So it means you have other reasons to constantly spam <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> besides an honest interest in conspiracies.  You&#39;re here to defend pedophiles.  It&#39;s ALL YOU DO HERE.</p>

<p>NinjaEdit: oh, and btw peeps, except for a single post, his account &quot;dead zone&quot; was actually six years. &quot;few weeks my hairy ass.</p>

<p>I would try to clarify for you again about this account, but I think that I&#39;ve already done it for anybody that actually reads what I wrote. But more importantly, <em>what the fuck does it matter</em>?</p>

<p>I could easily write a wall of text about whether the Rothschilds own central banks, if you really want me to. But, instead, here&#39;s an exercise. Suppose you found a piece of paper on the ground with two statements:</p>

<p>A. All but 3 of the central banks in the world are owned by the Rothschilds.<br/>
B. There are no Rothschild-controlled banks in the world. It is a hoax.</p>

<p>How would you go about determining whether statement A is true or statement B is true or the truth is somewhere in between?</p>

<p>Since you just found these on the ground, you can&#39;t whether the statement A was written by someone with a verified email address account on reddit, or by someone whose account is only 3 days old.</p>

<p>Tell me, what would you do in this situation?</p>
