<p>Well, they&#39;re not using code words and spirals are common shapes. They aren&#39;t constantly around children. Even if someone says pizza a lot and spends time with children it doesn&#39;t mean they are a pedophile. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Police can rip your car apart if their K9s simply smell maurijuana but if you show someone clear and irrefutable evidence that someone is an elitist child rapist this guy won&#39;t believe you and the countless victims probably in this thread right now. Even if you showed this moron a video of actual child rape he would say it&#39;s photoshop from the Russians</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Police smelling weed in your car have probable cause to search it, if they saw a distressed child in the window of comet ping pong, they would have probable cause to investigate - alas, no children have been harmed at CPP. </p>

<p>Not one victim of the alleged &quot;elitist pedophile ring&quot; involving podesta, Alefantis or his instagram friends has came forward, there are 0 such victims in this thread, because they don&#39;t exist. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Do you know all of the people accused have said that the hundreds of thousands of emails that implicate them directly were actually somehow all faked by &quot;Russian hackers&quot; in a literally impossible feat? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>No one has denied the validity of the Podesta emails. The emails do not implicate podesta in any crime. Not one emaik is a &quot;direct implication&quot; in a crime. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>It&#39;s totally normal to have an email basically ordering three young children be delivered to you by uber to be &quot;entertainment&quot; in the pool. No that is super fucking normal and it totally isn&#39;t something a pedo creep would do. /s</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The email was a bit of light hearted chat between friends describing an expected visit by a grandmother and her 3 grand children. The children&#39;s full names and ages are listed as a courtesy to other guests. These children are alive and well and have made no complaint to authorities even after much pizzagate publicity. </p>

<p>First accurate thing you&#39;ve said. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>he obviously uses common sense and logical reasoning and totally doesn&#39;t use all its time and energy to try to deny the fact that pedophiles are pedophiles. Its probably just a regular user that isn&#39;t being paid to spread cancer via threads on child rape investigations /ss        </p>

<p>Pedophillia exists, I find it abhorrent. There is no evidence at all that John Podesta, his brother, James Alefantis or his employees are pedophiles. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Have you even done research on Epstein or are you just rejecting his connections to the elite because it fits YOUR perspective on this? Epstein is very connected to the Clintons and Pedogate is much bigger than Comet Ping Pong so let&#39;s stop deflecting by referring to the pizza narrative for a minute. Epsteins connections to the Clintons and other elites is much more evident than his connections to Trump so I&#39;m not sure I understand what you mean when you say &quot;maybe he does have dirt on Trump&quot;... that comment alone shows your biased perspective. Trump was friends with him and did invite him to Maralago, Im not denying that, but he also banned him once he heard that Epstein was hitting on his friends minor aged daughter... This is bigger than Trump/Clinton... it&#39;s at the root of how our political system works bc Epstein and/or his people made videos of elitists engaged in these acts and theyve been used as blackmail against them... Did you even take the time to read the filings? Have you only done research to prove that Pedogate ISNT true rather than allowing your mind to remain open to the possibility that it is? Why is it so hard to believe that there are victims but they don&#39;t want to come forward out of fear of retaliation?  </p>

<p>Did you watch the recent Dr. Phil episode with the female who said she was owned by a very rich man who brought her to parties where she was passed around and sexually abused by powerful people? Or was that victim not believable enough for you? </p>

<p>As it stands, pedophile rings operate. That is not a conspiracy, that is fact. </p>

<p>Show me how comet ping pong or James Alefantis, or his employees are guilty of any child endangerment crime and we can move forward with your Dr Phil based theories, but seeing as you mentioned it, did she name her abusers and raise a complaint about them or what happened to her? I take it she&#39;s too scared huh.. But not scared enough to avoid the big check dr Phil gave her. </p>

As I said in my last comment, this is much bigger than Comet Ping Pong so stop deflecting by referring to that. CPP is just what started this whole conspiracy theory, but the circumstantial evidence far exceeds the CPP relation. </p>

<p>You ask for a victim and yet you shame the victim when they try to tell their story??? Do you really think that girl only cared about a check from Dr. Phil? Did you even watch the episode? And yes, she didn&#39;t mention names... does that mean that we shouldn&#39;t trust her simply because of that?? Fuck no... did you see how the media treated Juanita Broderick? Monica Lewinsky? You make it seem like coming out and naming HIGH LEVEL PEOPLE is an easy and simple task... you&#39;re wrong. People are killed for speaking out or going against the narrative. Do you know about Seth Rich? What about Monica Peterson? Michael Hastings? Gary Webb? The list is endless... her failure to give names does not discredit the truth of her story. </p>

<p>Except the very name &quot;Pizzagate&quot; is about Comet Ping Pong. You are the guys that point at this place and say it the center of the story.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And yes, she didn&#39;t mention names... does that mean that we shouldn&#39;t trust her simply because of that??</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, there is that whole thing about not going to the police and not mentioning names meaning that she can lie all she wants without fear of legal repercussions. That&#39;s the point.</p>

<p>We shouldn&#39;t &quot;trust her&quot; because she is making allegations of a particularly heinous criminal nature. The very foundation of the western legal system is that we do not &quot;trust&quot; accusers, we require evidence.</p>

<p>When there is no evidence we have to assume the accused is innocent.</p>

<p>You may not agree, but that is the way justice works.</p>

<p>I fear this may be the case. I have had people simply refuse to look at the parade of circumstantial evidence, refuse to read analysis, refuse to digest alternative information to the official story.</p>

<p>It&#39;s admittedly hard to take. When I realized the actual horror of the situation we are in, I went into a depressive spiral for about a month.

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d like to leave this question here, because this is the second mention of religion I&#39;ve seen in this post.</p>

<p>Apologies if this comes across as baiting, but I have a sincere question as someone on the outside looking in; do the people arguing for the reality of Pizzagate, in general, have any group leaning for or against gay rights? Not talking about the various politics of it, but rather the specific idea that queer is a legitimate lifestyle.</p>

<p>To clarify: I&#39;m a bisexual male teacher who deals with some very young children on a daily basis. Rarely, but occasionally, they ask me questions about sexuality, and I teach them that the latest science does prove that homosexuality and heterosexuality are equally legitimate and biologically-founded as lifestyles. I understand that the easiest way for some groups to shut me up would be to label me a pedophile, which would require little-to-no effort on the part of any would-be scandalmakers. In reality I&#39;m a teacher trying to do my job and impart the facts on these kids independent of any &quot;agenda&quot;-- I don&#39;t teach them anything I cannot prove, in other words.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know enough to say whether Pizzagate is real or not. But I know that I, personally, have not bothered to look into it because of the (possibly quite wrong!!) assumption that this was a dog-whistle to homophobic or transphobic groups. I&#39;m used to pedophilia being the go-to accusation for people who think homosexuality is an &quot;abomination&quot;, despite the lack of supporting data (basically like comparing bears and people who eat honey). I mean it when I say I have no time to entertain those opinions as legitimate lines of inquiry. But I would also feel like I was feeding the problem if I dismissed a line of inquiry just because I <em>assumed</em> a group was trying to promote an anti-gay agenda. Is anyone able to shed any light on this facet for me?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have had two friends of mine with gay family members tell me they think PG is a dog-whistly smear of the gay community. I try to keep that in the back of my mind as I continue to research, but the circumstantial evidence is so heavy on the scale that I have to reject it.</p>

<p>Personally, I&#39;ve never given much of a shit about anybody&#39;s sexuality. But I do think political correctness when it comes to not wanting to challenge or offend the gay community has something to do with this.</p>

<p>I had a conversation with a very open-minded and &quot;woke&quot; gay friend of mine about PG and what certainly appears to me to be the grooming of boys to homosexuality by some members of the gay community. He told me that he felt he was born gay, but also that the grooming and abuse does go on. This sounds about right to me.</p>

<p>Because, let me ask you: If we believe in science and evolution and natural selection, how is it--if homosexuality is innate at birth--being gay has not been bred out of the population? If it&#39;s a genetic thing, and most gay people do not reproduce, why is roughly 2-5% (depending on who you believe) of the population gay?</p>

<p>I do think you should dig into PG more. Here&#39;s a good primer, I&#39;d be interested in what you think should you choose to read it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for your civil response. I&#39;ve seen firsthand how the label &quot;homophobic&quot; or &quot;smear of the gay community&quot; can shut down dialogue and I wanted to make sure I didn&#39;t perpetuate that.</p>

<p>I largely consider the nature-vs.-nuture argument moot. If people are born with their sexuality, great, encourage it. If people choose their sexuality, great, no difference. It only seems to be an issue because we still have a detachment of our society thinking that &quot;men should be men, and women should be women,&quot; an idea riddled with logical fallacies and bad evidence. Without that pervasively destructive notion, I think we&#39;d both live in a world where neither of us had to hear about another person&#39;s choices in bed. I&#39;ve personally had experiences not unlike the &quot;grooming&quot; you describe, but I dislike that term because it implies that being &quot;opened up&quot; to one&#39;s homosexuality is somehow an aberration, while I see a lot of my students <em>actually being forced</em> to &quot;open up&quot; to heterosexuality on a daily basis by the media (mostly TV, granted) that they unconsciously consume. It&#39;s scary the lengths some people will go to deny that their own heterosexuality is just as constructed as most homosexual identities.</p>

<p>The link you included is much appreciated, I respect that reddit is built for most holistic discussions but finding a &quot;Starting Point&quot; is always helpful, and this seems very clearly laid-out. When I have a chance I will certainly take a look.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t fall for their bullshit.</p>

<p>Just look at the link they sent you. The first two claims are completely bogus.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The term &quot;cheese pizza&quot; (which was pretty much coined on 4chan) <strong>does not appear in any of the emails</strong>. You can search for it yourself: <a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/">https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/</a></p></li>
<li><p>The other &quot;code words&quot; are completely made up (the only source for them is a 4chan post). There&#39;s no source for me to post, since they literally made it up.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>And that&#39;s what they put at the top of their page! The &quot;evidence&quot; only gets shakier than this.</p>

<p>Also, you&#39;re right about PG being tainted by homophobia.</p>

<p>Here are a few examples:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>James Alefantis, one of the accused, used a picture of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antinous">Antinous</a> as his profile picture. Even though multiple sources (<a href="http://www.positivelite.com/component/zoo/item/the-antinous-cult-the-story-of-the-first-gay-superstar">1</a>, <a href="http://antinousgaygod.blogspot.com/">2</a>, <a href="http://www.antinopolis.org/religion/gay-religion.html">3</a>) agree that Antinous has been a gay icon for years, PG proponents still claim that Antinous is a symbol for pederasty.</p></li>
<li><p>There&#39;s a <a href="https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564x/2c/bc/ee/2cbcee95527ace707ef856f21cf546fe.jpg">picture</a> of a half-dressed man covered in fake blood (taken on Halloween) that looks like it was taken at Comet Ping Pong. The picture was not uploaded by JA. Whether one finds it tasteful or not, PG proponents use it as evidence that JA is a <strong>child molester</strong> and Satan worshiper. It&#39;s just a man in drag on Halloween. Had that been a beautiful woman, would JA still be accused of pedophilia?</p></li>
<li><p>They use this <a href="http://i.imgur.com/CPdys3P.png">picture</a> to claim that JA &quot;loves children&quot;. The man in the picture owns the <a href="http://www.lenfantcafe.com/">&quot;L&#39;Enfant Cafe&quot;</a>, named after <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Charles_L%27Enfant">Pierre L&#39;Enfant</a> known for designing the street layout of Washington DC (where the cafe is located).</p></li>
<li><p>From the link posted above, they use <a href="https://qph.ec.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-04aaf9470e93c115d3a3a0040ff77c47-c">these</a> two <a href="https://qph.ec.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-855fe79a765641ea1e4c0f12779f0d2d">pictures</a> of grown men in sexually suggestive poses with pizza as proof that JA is a <strong>pedophile</strong>. Even though he&#39;s not even the one who uploaded them!</p></li>
</ol>

<p>These are just some examples of the bullshit that is PG.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Take an upvote for your questions in good will. May I say something?</p>

<p>This:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>and I teach them that the latest science does prove that homosexuality and heterosexuality are equally legitimate and biologically-founded as lifestyles.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Does not make any sense, if you&#39;re trying to suggest that science has anything to do with practical reasoning/ethics. For one, what could you possibly mean by &quot;legitimate&quot;? That people do, in fact, live homo/hetero lifestyles? Okay great, fine, you&#39;ve established a &quot;scientific fact&quot; (using a philosophical term of art, mind you). Human beings live such lives. </p>

<p>Biologically founded? You mean nonhuman animals do it too? Or that there are speculative, plausible hypotheses about why homo sapiens feature homosexual behaviors? Okay fine. But also not the same as &quot;lifestyle&quot; either.</p>

<p>Look, I&#39;m not judging you. Not my job here. Just thought I should let you know:</p>

<p>The scientific enterprise has literally <em>nothing</em> to do with establishing whether or not homosexuality is &quot;okay.&quot; That is a philosophical question, and most modern ethical theories, apart from natural law theory, are amenable in some fashion or another to homosexuality, though I&#39;m sure you could find disagreement in all of them. That being said, it appears to be the case, in western academia, that there is overwhelming support for homosexuality. Liberal democracy, go figure.</p>

<p>But if you&#39;re telling children, &quot;homosexuality is just as okay as heterosexuality, because science says so,&quot; you&#39;re doing those children a disservice. Science doesn&#39;t really have shit to say about the &quot;legitimacy&quot; of homosexuality. And that&#39;s a <em>good</em> thing. Philosophy does this work, and you demonstrate <em>rationally</em> why it is the case homosexuality is okay, not go out and study homo sapiens and then conclude, &quot;ha! there <em>are</em> homosexuals that are legitimately out there,&quot; or find a pet theory like Kinsey&#39;s and say, &quot;see? everyone&#39;s a bit of a homosexual; it must be okay!&quot;</p>

<p>None of these are good reasons. Typically, arguments will run along the lines of (and this is a <em>very</em> rough sketch): &quot;two consenting adults can rightly do what they want,&quot; &quot;nobody is being hurt/pleasure is increased by doing so,&quot; &quot;we should seek to foster loving relationships,&quot; etc. These are <em>not</em> scientific. They are answers to normative ethical questions, that purport to establish (at least, if you&#39;re a moral realist, which I believe around 60% of western academics are) &quot;truth&quot; (now define that too) or objectively (as some antirealists do) that it is the case that such behaviors are okay.</p>

<p>As for people who call homosexuality an abomination (a minority in western philosophy), they don&#39;t all just point to the bible and call it a day. It&#39;s much too complicated to get into here, but let&#39;s just say, essentially all prepostmodern-esque ethical thought was not friendly to homosexuality as we understand it (of course, pederastry was an occurrence in one of the greatest philosophical hotspots in human history, i.e. Greece, but it also isn&#39;t &quot;homosexuality&quot; as we know it), so it&#39;s not as cut and dry as you&#39;re making it. Also, as a note, certain methods of defending homosexyality <em>may</em> also involve sacrificing many beliefs you probably hold about science (but maybe not, I&#39;m just saying).</p>

<p>And it&#39;s incredibly, incredibly doubtful that any of this has anything to do with perniciously working against the liberal &quot;agenda.&quot; Highly doubtful.</p>

Those are news articles you can find yourself on the &quot;bullshit conjecture&quot; websites and MSM websites--even if they make you dig a little. There may be false flags and plenty of unfounded claims thrown around, and although that&#39;s a shame, the arrests alone are enough in-your-face evidence to prove Pedogate exists. I encourage you to go and read the charges on these people arrested, imagine it was your child, then convince the world Pedogate is a bullshit theory that doesn&#39;t deserve thorough investigation and outrage. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>it&#39;s getting more exhausting by the day.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you&#39;re getting exhausted, you&#39;re doing it wrong. The thing about conspiracies is that people naturally don&#39;t want to consider them, because that would make their ego feel duped (&quot;oh if the gov&#39;t was playing me for an idiot I would know, trust me&quot;). </p>

<p>Here&#39;s my playbook for discussing conspiracies with people who are out of the loop:</p>

<p><strong>a)</strong> <em>Never try to cold-start a conspiracy conversation</em>, but you can try to fit in some light and proven conspiracies into a conversation about politics, corporatism, corruption etc.</p>

<p><strong>b)</strong> If your intended audience is not receptive at all, and does not even acknowledge basic government fuckery, don&#39;t bother. It&#39;ll just exhaust you and you will have achieved nothing at all. </p>

<p><strong>c)</strong> If the audience is receptive to some of the conspiracies (corruption in politics and banking according to experience are almost universally acknowledged), you can build on that by adding detail and information to their already-existing knowledge base. After that they may be more receptive to being led down the rabbit hole.</p>

<p><strong>d)</strong> Don&#39;t go all out all at once. People who don&#39;t understand CIA psyops such as Mockinbird and politician-control projects such as brownstone, will be very hard to explain pedogate to. Always stick to the basic facts in order to lay the groundwork for explaining deeper conspiracies.</p>

<p><strong>e)</strong> Be cool. If people don&#39;t want to wake up that&#39;s their own issue and you can&#39;t &quot;fix&quot; it. No need to stress yourself about the things you can&#39;t control.</p>

<p>Bonus conspiracy protip: <em>Never</em> start with chemtrails. Chemtrail discussions always require a primer of casually/jokingly telling the other party to watch the sky every now and then, so they can see for themselves. If they actually go through with it (you&#39;d be surprised how many people just NEVER look up at the sky) they&#39;ll either notice that something&#39;s going on, or it &quot;doesn&#39;t look like anything&quot; to them. People who trust the MSM and gov&#39;t more than their own eyes will only wake up once the gov&#39;t orders them to, so again; no need to waste time there.</p>

<p><strong>Example</strong> (<em>after</em> having identified a receptive audience)<strong>:</strong> Never say &quot;they&#39;re spraying us&quot;, stick to &quot;they&#39;re spraying for geoengineering&quot;. Then explain what geoengineering is. Then explain how vested interests such as big oil (established conspirators working with both sides of the political spectrum) are involved with prolonging fossil fuel use for personal gain. Finally, you can mention how the spraying could potentially be hazardous to human life on its own (respiratory illnesses etc).</p>

<p><strong>edit &amp; tldr:</strong> Remember that this is not a sprint, it&#39;s a marathon. Conserve energy and don&#39;t waste effort on unreceptive audiences. Always stick to the facts (with a dash of suggestion) and let your audience unravel the conspiracies themselves.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Stop broadcasting half baked theories. Treat it like a scientific paper. Do the research, do the digging, find the irrefutable evidence to support your case, put it all together in the most clear, concise, convincing, and correct way possible, and THEN broadcast it. When there are people shouting over megaphones about this and that before there&#39;s sufficient evidence it provides skeptics the opportunity to refute the claims due to lack of sufficient proof and write off the whole thing moving forward. If you announce each new tidbit that connects things people grow tired of hearing your voice and learn to ignore it. Build a solid case, and scrutinize it to death so when you get on your soapbox with your megaphone there&#39;s no denying your truth. (or the process could show that there isn&#39;t enough evidence and that&#39;s a valuable discovery too, in theory) </p>

<p>I largely consider the nature-vs.-nuture argument moot. If people are born with their sexuality, great, encourage it. If people choose their sexuality, great, no difference. It only seems to be an issue because we still have a detachment of our society thinking that &quot;men should be men, and women should be women,&quot; an idea riddled with logical fallacies and bad evidence. Without that pervasively destructive notion, I think we&#39;d both live in a world where neither of us had to hear about another person&#39;s choices in bed. I&#39;ve personally had experiences not unlike the &quot;grooming&quot; you describe, but I dislike that term because it implies that being &quot;opened up&quot; to one&#39;s homosexuality is somehow an aberration, while I see a lot of my students <em>actually being forced</em> to &quot;open up&quot; to heterosexuality on a daily basis by the media (mostly TV, granted) that they unconsciously consume. It&#39;s scary the lengths some people will go to deny that their own heterosexuality is just as constructed as most homosexual identities.</p>

<p>The link you included is much appreciated, I respect that reddit is built for most holistic discussions but finding a &quot;Starting Point&quot; is always helpful, and this seems very clearly laid-out. When I have a chance I will certainly take a look.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Of course I recognize it. Who wouldn&#39;t?</p>

<p>I just find it amusing that, instead of actually discussing the conspiracy or disputing what I said or whatever, you basically tell me to shut up.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>pedophiles that are making pedo jokes and using pedo codewords and symbols when they are constantly around children isn&#39;t a problem.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, they&#39;re not using code words and spirals are common shapes. They aren&#39;t constantly around children. Even if someone says pizza a lot and spends time with children it doesn&#39;t mean they are a pedophile. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Police can rip your car apart if their K9s simply smell maurijuana but if you show someone clear and irrefutable evidence that someone is an elitist child rapist this guy won&#39;t believe you and the countless victims probably in this thread right now. Even if you showed this moron a video of actual child rape he would say it&#39;s photoshop from the Russians</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Police smelling weed in your car have probable cause to search it, if they saw a distressed child in the window of comet ping pong, they would have probable cause to investigate - alas, no children have been harmed at CPP. </p>

<p>Not one victim of the alleged &quot;elitist pedophile ring&quot; involving podesta, Alefantis or his instagram friends has came forward, there are 0 such victims in this thread, because they don&#39;t exist. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Do you know all of the people accused have said that the hundreds of thousands of emails that implicate them directly were actually somehow all faked by &quot;Russian hackers&quot; in a literally impossible feat? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>No one has denied the validity of the Podesta emails. The emails do not implicate podesta in any crime. Not one emaik is a &quot;direct implication&quot; in a crime. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>It&#39;s totally normal to have an email basically ordering three young children be delivered to you by uber to be &quot;entertainment&quot; in the pool. No that is super fucking normal and it totally isn&#39;t something a pedo creep would do. /s</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The email was a bit of light hearted chat between friends describing an expected visit by a grandmother and her 3 grand children. The children&#39;s full names and ages are listed as a courtesy to other guests. These children are alive and well and have made no complaint to authorities even after much pizzagate publicity. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Just ask this genius u/LilMissGuided</p>
</blockquote>

<p>First accurate thing you&#39;ve said. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>he obviously uses common sense and logical reasoning and totally doesn&#39;t use all its time and energy to try to deny the fact that pedophiles are pedophiles. Its probably just a regular user that isn&#39;t being paid to spread cancer via threads on child rape investigations /ss        </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Pedophillia exists, I find it abhorrent. There is no evidence at all that John Podesta, his brother, James Alefantis or his employees are pedophiles. </p>

<p>Have a great day! </p>
