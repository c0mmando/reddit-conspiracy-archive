       That's also because of a lot of people who are now Trumpists, were Bush apologists. Just because you are supporting a different NWO faction, doesn't mean a lot of you still aren't useful idiots.
      </p>
      <p>
       You are allowed to dislike Bush/Cheney and Trump.
      </p>
      <p>
       No one is talking about how Trump is massively increased drone strikes, but all you Republican supporters were bitching for years about the drones.

       People need to stop selling Trump as the savior. It's politics, there are no saviors just elected public servants (that work for cash for billionaires).

       This is what immediately made me pause.  Drone strikes are not legal, Constitutional, or acceptable in my world.  The state does not have the authority to be judge, jury and executioner, against American citizens overseas especially.

       I think your argument here is a clear example of the real problem in America. Not believing Trump is a Russian Puppet is nowhere near the same thing as supporting Putin and to equivocate the two sides as the only two possibilities is wrong on many levels.
      </p>
      <p>
       The elites and powers that rule have convinced us that there are only two sides to every problem either right or left, right or wrong. THIS IS A LIE, the world isn't black and white, nothing exists in a bubble. Turning every issue into an us against them ultimately further divides the people getting us further away from real solutions. Step outside the partisan politics that have dominated our country and observe the manufactured hatred through propaganda on both sides. It's horrifying.

       Isn't this my point?

       This post is suggesting things are black and white. That because Dick Cheney is promoting the Russia-Trump conspiracy, and he's  a known war criminal, then it's not true.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's suggesting this is black and white.

      <p>
       My comment shows there are war criminals support both sides of this argument, so the idea not that one side is wrong because Putin or Cheney supports it makes no sense.

       You got my comment exactly backwards.

       Believing that the election was influenced by Russia is nowhere near the same as backing Dick Cheney in any way. I'm sure he also believes in gravity, I guess that means gravity is fake.

      <p>
       If I support Cheny because he thinks Trump colluded with Russia, then do you support Putin because you both say the opposite?
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course, you don't support Putin, and I don't support Cheny.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can believe Dick Cheny is a monster, Putin is an evil genius, Hillary Clinton is corrupt, and Trump is a man child that colluded with Russia. None of those things contradict one another.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just because a war criminal believes something, doesn't mean the opposite is always true. This is what you are suggesting, and it is incredibly flawed logic.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, Dick Cheny believes in gravity, but, using your logic, believing in gravity means that you would also support Dick Cheny.
      </p>
      <p>
       Cheny and Putin both believe in gravity, so, using your logic, Cheny supports Putin, and Putin supports Cheny.
      </p>
      <p>
       Everyone agrees with war criminals on blatantly obvious things. Trump working with Russia, given the overwhelming evidence that continues to emerge, is blatantly obvious, and a war criminal monster acknowledging this obvious fact doesn't discredit it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think Dick Cheny is a monster and also believe it's clear Trump worked with Russia. Those two things have nothing to do with one another.

       That's not whataboutism because my entire point wasn't that other people are committing the same crimes as Cheny, it was to point out that the entire logic or this post is flawed, and that a war criminals belief in a statement doesn't make it untrue.
      </p>
      <p>
       No matter what you believe in this issue, and many other issues that are undeniably true, there is a war criminal that believes the same thing. So, the idea that war criminal's opinion has any bearing on the truthfulness of this issue makes no sense. Not only because that has no logic to back it up, but because it means all sides are both right and wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       I brought up Putin because he was an obvious example of a war criminal that agrees with your view of the situation, and the intention was for people to look at the opposite side of the coin to see how poor the logic of this post really is.
      </p>
      <p>
       Henry Kissenger is a very smart man that is likely right about most things he believes. He is also an evil war criminal that has caused immeasurable harm, but that doesn't mean the opposite of everything he says is true.

       I understand your point, but you are failing to see the distinction between Dick Cheny, Putin, and Henry Kissenger. The difference isn't in the people themselves as you are arguing, but rather in the media portrayal of their credibility. Look on NBC, CNN, any many other "mainstream" sites you would find on politics. They are using Dick Cheny's support for Russian interference as a way of furthering their credibility which as the post claim's is nonsensical and hypocritical especially considering his past lies and war crimes.
      </p>
      <p>
       They are all war criminals, but the difference is that the public perception of Chaney is that he is a credible source which is what this post is really getting at. The logic of the post is precisely the same as what you are arguing, that someone's support over a political believe doesn't effect its validity, and ironically enough using someone's opinion who is a known liar and war criminal diminishes the credibility.

       I absolutely agree with your point that it's disgusting seeing guys like Cheny and Kissenger portrayed with credibility in the mainstream media, but that wasn't the nature of the comment I was responding to, and it isn't the nature of this post.
      </p>
      <p>
       Frankly, it hasn't been the point we've been discussing either. With all due respect, you're moving the goalposts.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Hey Reddit, do you get it yet? Dick fucking Cheney is promoting your Russia-Trump conspiracy. The M.I.C. and B.I.C. thank you for your cooperation in ushering in WW3.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The nature of this thread, and every comment I've posted in it, has been specifically about associating anyone who believes the overwhelming amount of evidence pointing to collusion between Trump and Russia with Dick Cheny somehow. Which is ridiculous.
      </p>
      <p>
       Only now, with your last comment, has the fact that the MSM is despicably using war criminals as legitimate sources become the topic of discussion. And I agree with you on that topic.

       He lied, the whole administration lied about wmds, they coerced or paid the media to shove the narrative down your eager throats day after day after day, and the public bought it and you guys got to kill like, thousands of people, just in order to make the obselcenely rich, a little tiny bit more rich.

       Also I can never let this pass; we all know it now, I think  some people just use the words still out of habit: There was no hack of the DNC, the information was leaked from within the DNC.

       There is more evidence that russia hacked the DNC than anything else. Even Trump agrees. All intelligance agencies agree. The house intelligence committee (run by republicans) agrees.

       Name a single shred that's not Intelligence agencies agree or "are investigating." Have you read the report's they have released? They literally have disclaimers claiming that they could be completely wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       And let's say that Russia did hack the DNC, why does the source of the leak's matter? Why is it that we aren't and never have discussed the actual content of the leak? That's what effected the election, do the American people not deserve to see information that would effect there decision? Are you arguing that the American people would be better off not seeing this information? Not only that, but the U.S. has spent billions of dollar's on influencing and "hacking" other people elections including Crimea effecting Russia. It's extremely hypocritical to act as though we are justified in all of those cases, but other countries can't do it towards us.

      <pre><code>GEOGRAPHY: At least one of the hacker groups attacking the DNC appeared to cease operations on Russian holidays, and its work hours aligned with a Russian time zone, cybersecurity company FireEye concluded in a report.
LANGUAGE: The hackers also left an obvious digital fingerprint, one cybersecurity expert said, perhaps on purpose: a signature in Russia's Cyrillic alphabet.
FORENSIC EVIDENCE: After a different batch of hacked Democratic emails was released last month, a wide spectrum of cyber-security experts concluded that it was the work of Russian intelligence agencies through previously known proxy groups known as COZY BEAR or APT 29, and FANCY BEAR or APT 28. "We've had lots of experience with both of these actors … and know them well," according to the DNC's own contract cybersecurity firm, Crowdstrike, which blogged that one of the two groups had already gained illegal access to the White House, State Department and even the military's Joint Chiefs of Staff.
MOTIVE: Given their mutual and very public bromance, Putin would much prefer a Trump presidency to a Clinton one, and the timing suggests the leak was timed for maximum embarrassment to the Democrats and their presumptive nominee. Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook said the campaign was told by cyber experts that Russian hackers stole and released the emails to help Trump. "I don't think it's coincidental that these emails were released on the eve of our convention here," said Mook, "and I think that's disturbing."
HISTORY: U.S. intelligence officials, including Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, said they had previously seen evidence of foreign hackers spying on U.S. presidential candidates, including some state-sponsored ones, and that such cyber-intrusions would become even more commonplace.

       Geography is the one of WORST WAYS of determining where a hacker came from because as someone in the industry all it takes is a VPN to fake that. No real security expert is buying that.

       You clearly have no idea the way computer security works do you? It's not like they are releasing an zero-day backdoor exploit to some Oracle server or something, literally ANYTHING physically linking the hacking to Russia. If you really think that any sort of hard evidence would in any way "expose their clandestine espionage tactics" you are very naive my friend.

       Nice strawman again, if they released any hard evidence linking it then I would accept it in a heartbeat, but they haven't and you haven't. Everything you said has been a "he said she said." If it wouldn't hold up in a court then it sure as hell isn't holding up for me.

       <p>
        The forensic evidence that links network breaches to known groups is solid: used and reused tools, methods, infrastructure, even unique encryption keys. For example: in late March the attackers registered a domain with a typo—misdepatrment[.]com—to look suspiciously like the company hired by the DNC to manage its network, MIS Department. They then linked this deceptive domain to a long-known APT 28 so-called X-Tunnel command-and-control IP address, 45.32.129[.]185.
       </p>
       <p>
        One of the strongest pieces of evidence linking GRU to the DNC hack is the equivalent of identical fingerprints found in two burglarized buildings: a reused command-and-control address—176.31.112[.]10—that was hard coded in a piece of malware found both in the German parliament as well as on the DNC's servers. Russian military intelligence was identified by the German domestic security agency BfV as the actor responsible for the Bundestag breach. The infrastructure behind the fake MIS Department domain was also linked to the Berlin intrusion through at least one other element, a shared SSL certificate.
       </p>
       <p>
        The evidence linking the Guccifer 2.0 account to the same Russian operators is not as solid, yet a deception operation—a GRU false flag, in technical jargon—is still highly likely.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       This is some serious mental gymastic's the base of their argument is basically relying on the assumption that a) you can identify a hacker based upon the tools they use which anyone in the industry knows is 100% wrong b) That the ip address they found wasn't spoofed which any decent hacker let alone a "KGB" or "Russian" high level one would easily know how to do and they would reuse shared SSL certificate (LOL), and c) Gufficer2.0 is this Russian worker which they even admit is a stretch.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again you probably have no idea what any of this means and it's just a "they are all saying it" type of situation. None of this is hard evidence and they know it and continue to spin it acting as if it were the truth.

       Spoofing an IP address used for a C&amp;C server is very easy to detect, your responses to it wouldn't reach it because you're sending to the spoofed address not the real one. I wonder exactly what you do to be making these claims that seem so far off base from my own experience in the industry.

       Specific malware used is also pretty common for attribution. These things aren't solid 100% proof, but we don't dismiss them when doing attribution.

       Everyone in the field knows there is room for error, but that doesn't stop you from saying this group is by and large the most likely to have done it. The hard evidence people ask for could only be obtained through classified means, which I don't think we'll ever see, but we should demand it if our government pushes us to go to war over it.

       Let's say you are right about this classification, then we should demand it anyways, we deserve to have proof for these acquisitions because if they did release it they would stop these nonsensical arguments we are having here, but they won't because THIS IS WHAT THEY WANT. The biggest problem I have is that EVERYONE ADMITS that Russia is ONLY A LIKELY SUSPECT, yet what is the media narrative. That Russia, "Hacked the election." That doesn't remotely describe the situation and no one outside of a very few people know
      </p>
      <p>
       a) What exactly was hacked, b) the method of hacking let alone why Russia is the likely suspect, people just throw it off as fact because "NYT said so" or "WaPost says so." This herd mentality is what leads to endless wars that the people think they are in the name of "freedom." Read Brave New World if you want to see what that leads to.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't see how these things relate at all to anything classified because they aren't.

        Let's say you are right about this classification, then we should demand it anyways, we deserve to have proof for these acquisitions because if they did release it they would stop these nonsensical arguments we are having here, but they won't because THIS IS WHAT THEY WANT. The biggest problem I have is that EVERYONE ADMITS that Russia is ONLY A LIKELY SUSPECT, yet what is the media narrative. That Russia, "Hacked the election." That doesn't remotely describe the situation and no one outside of a very few people know
       </p>
       <p>
        a) What exactly was hacked, b) the method of hacking let alone why Russia is the likely suspect, people just throw it off as fact because "NYT said so" or "WaPost says so." This herd mentality is what leads to endless wars that the people think they are in the name of "freedom." Read Brave New World if you want to see what that leads to.
       </p>
       <p>
        I don't see how these things relate at all to anything classified because they aren't.

       The methods used for collection are most definitely classified and revealing them would compromise them for future operations, it takes years to get these kinds of assets in place.  If we don't take action I don't expect them to release that, if we go to war or something else like that I think it's necessary they show us due to their lies in the past, but until then if they would rather preserve their assets I can understand why.  Us arguing is inconsequential, if the collection methods are what have been rumored there are consequences for revealing them.

       I'm not sure I understand what you're saying here. The server that was hacked is the DNC server. If you mean the servers the nsa/CIA hacked to perform this collection that would be classified.

       For me, the meetings with the Russian Ambassador are circumstantial.  It's when you add the meetings with Ambassador Kislyak with the numerous Trump Administration and campaign officials with business ties to Putin's associates (Gen. Flynn, Sec. Tillerson, Paul Manafort, etc.), plus actions which appear consistent with a cover-up on the part of Rep. Nunes, that leads me to believe there is need for a serious investigation.
      </p>
      <p>
       (1)  There was a hack.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's just fact.  Whether it was done externally, or by an internal whistleblowers, a hack of both the DNC and of Leon Panetta was committed.
      </p>
      <p>
       (2) Cheney claimed there was a hack on a foreign power.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's what our Intelligence community believes too.
       <br/>
       That's what most of our civilian cyber-analysts who looked at the leaks, especially the initial release that was posted to DCLeaks, believes too.  Perhaps Cheney is wrong, or misinformed (it wouldn't be the first time, but based on public knowledge, it's not outlandish he would come to this opinion)
      </p>
      <p>
       (3) With intent to disrupt the legal electoral process
      </p>
      <p>
       If Russia did commit the hack, it's not a large leap of logic to assign this motive to their actions.
      </p>
      <p>
       (4) It is an act of war.
      </p>
      <p>
       If Cheney stubbed his toe on "a rock," he'd want to launch an invasion of Iraq, just because they're similar phonetically.  He's way way ahead of his skis on that one.  First, we need to prove the first three, and then we can discuss how the U.S. responds appropriately and proportionately.  Even if the first 3 assertions are correct, labeling it an act of war seems to me a disproportionate response.

       What exactly is being investigated if the alleged collusion has already taken place and any available evidence related to those communications has presumably already been intercepted by our foreign intelligence surveillance apparatus?

       They're investigating a number of allegations, the allegation of collusion is only one of many.
      </p>
      <p>
       We don't know exactly what they're investigating, but let's just say they're vetting the Steele dossier, which we know they were given a copy of by Sen. McCain.  There's allegations of espionage in that dossier.  There's also allegations of the Trump Corporation doing business with the Iranian Republican Guard involving a hotel deal in Azerbaijan.  Again, we don't know for certain what the FBI is investigating, and we damn sure don't know if any allegations are true, but there's stuff out there.
      </p>
      <p>
       Director Comey did say he'd be investigating crimes related to the hack, not just the hack itself.

       The only thing worse than collusion would be knowingly engaging in clandestine intelligence gathering activities for or on behalf of a foreign power, and any available evidence of that has also already been intercepted (I would be beyond shocked if any Trump associates are engaging in such activities while under investigation).
      </p>
      <p>
       So if the only evidence in existence (and that likely will ever exist) should have already been gathered, what is currently being investigated?

       Again,we don't know.

      <p>
       Pure speculation?  I would suspect business relationships and deals that happened before Trump announced his candidacy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some of the allegations that are being thrown around in this thing include allegations that Trump was laundering money for Putin-associated oligarchs.  There are allegations in the Steele dossier that Trump and associates were feeding Russia intelligence on Russian nationals living in the U.S.
      </p>
      <p>
       Paul Manafort's relationship with Putin associates goes way back, especially during his time in Ukraine.  If they're investigating him and his relationship with Viktor Yanukovych, there's quite a bit of investigation that needs to be done, especially since a lot of the documentation of Manafort's role in Ukraine was destroyed in the 2014 revolution.

       One cybersec firm looked into the DNC event. One firm, whose co-founder is a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council, a NATO think tank funded by various govts and defense corporations. For all you know, all the "anonymous experts" who've been weighing in are people from that same firm.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not following the "logic" that disclosing factual info in the form of the emails "disrupted" the (farcical, but that's another story) democratic process...theoretically journalists would be more interested in veracity of that kind of info rather than the source. But that assumes 99% of journalists aren't boot-licking useful idiots for the govt of course.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also it doesn't matter what you or any of these media scumbags think the response "should" be, or how you discuss it, because as of 2014 under official NATO Article 5 policy a full scale military response to "cyberattacks" are options that are very much on the table.

       Not only have they developed a way to hack anyone and make it look like anyone else did it, they then lost control of this system to the fucking internet...

      <p>
       So IF there was a hack, despite all evidence pointing to an internal leak, there is literally, absolutely no way of knowing where it came from.

      <p>
       And that, coupled​ with the word of Richard "DubbayaMDs-in-iraq" Cheney is a really, really thin excuse for war.

       For one, all evidence does not point to an internal leak.  Most evidence points externally.  You might choose to not believe that evidence, and instead choose to believe the Marc Rich theory as it pertains to the DNC release, but it exists.  The Panetta release was almost certainly an external hack, and really the only doubt among conspiracy theorists being whether it came from the Russian Govt. or from an individual citizen.
      </p>
      <p>
       I completely agree that we shouldn't take the word of Dick Cheney.  I'm just saying that instead of lazily believing the opposite of what he's saying, it's more prudent to ignore what he's saying completely, and look for the truth elsewhere.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, I agree that even if the hacks came from the Russian Government, it's in no way an excuse for war.

There's like a dozen pizzagate posts trying to tie Clinton to pedophiles despite the fact that there's no evidence for that, but Trump's admin having contacts with Russia is apparently too far-fetched to investigate.

       That's an easy one.  ShareBlue, CTR, et al has descended on this sub like never before pushing a vehemently anti-trump agenda.  It is manipulation few sub-members are unaware of, and when outside entities attempt to manipulate this sub, as does happen from time to time, you are going to get push back.

       On the front page there are two stickied posts, one saying trump is a Rosthchild plant and the other discussing the Awan brothers and how Debbie Wasserman Schultz et al gave these unsavory characters access to quite a bit of classified info.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most of the pizzagate posts I see are pointing at Podesta and Alefantis, though Clinton does get mentioned on occasion because Podesta did kind of work for her.  That said, I look at the front page and I see 9/11, ISP concerns, DEA concerns, Monsant0 concerns, Obama shenanigans....actually, it's pretty diverse so for a long time member like me who never in a million years would have voted for trump....I see nothing wrong.

       I think your partisanship is likely the agent of your tribulations.  This sub does not want to be an echo chamber like
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics
       </a>
       ,
       <a href="/r/the_donald">
        /r/the_donald
       </a>
       , et al.  The goal here is for a diversity of opinions and open discussion.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, when users seemingly do nothing but complain about one side, they out themselves as potentially part of the push to manipulate this sub into an
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics
       </a>
       or
       <a href="/r/the_donald">
        /r/the_donald
       </a>
       clone, or perhaps the 100 or so (relatively new to coincide with the recent reddit change to the front page) anti Trump subs.  Hence the pushback.

       I wonder if bitcoin tipping still works? It looks like they might have taken the bot down a couple months ago. Not sure if someone came up with a replacement. Maybe some nice person will roll through with the schizzy on that.
      </p>
      <p>
       edit: for that matter I got a bitcoin tip back when they were only like $50 each lol. I totally forgot about that and never collected it. I wonder if I could figure out how to redeem it?

       See, you calling it a T_D narrative kind of outs you as the other side (Shareblue CTR).   The rest of us don't care if there are more anti trump stories or more anti Clinton stories on a given day.  It's not our job to care.  The only people who truly care about that are employed to care about that.  And it has been my experience and the experience of many sub members that this is a daily occurrence.  Not a day seems to go by where the mix of stories in
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       isn't the subject of bitching and moaning from one side or the other, and it's obvious where that comes from.  It's also obvious it is coordinated, rather than organic.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course, that's just my opinion from watching the development of shills, trolls, etc on this site since the DiGG migration.

       More of that two party narrative.  For an alleged third party, you're certainly adamant when it comes to telling everybody they're one side or the other.  You make a show of criticizing the "two party" system and then tell us we have to believe everybody is one side or the other.  It makes your protests seem less ... authentic to me.

       Don't truly care what you think, but you are free to believe whatever you like.

       All observation is subjective to the observer.

       You keep bringing up those documents, as though they are definitive proof of anything.  It's getting funnier every single time you do it.

       No, my opinion is supported by the opinions of many others, who know enough not to be baited into providing shills ideas on how to refine their methods.  Like I said, you are free to believe or disbelieve my claims, but your continued zeal to disprove the notion shills from the left are active in this sub is damning, to say the least.  Why do you care if sub members think there are shills from Shareblue/CTR active in this sub?  Are you concerned that their profits might be affected?

       We each have our own take on "reality," so stop pretending yours is universal.  Again, my goal is not to prove anything because that would have the effect of making those disgusting human beings harder to spot.

       I've actually got a "facts and evidence" bias.  I don't automatically think people are telling the truth and make my decisions based on majority consensus, because both sides are not always the same.  People believe pretty lies and ugly truths get buried.

       Dig deep enough and everyone has a political bias.  I've said over and over again that just because someone holds a different opinion that doesn't mean they are a shill.   It is very easy to tell the difference between someone who truly holds different beliefs versus someone who is being employed to push a certain narrative.  I'm not sure how many different ways I can say it.

       Well, i'm certainly willing to listen to different opinions, but what's making up your mind?  Do you think that the shareblue playbook we got was fake?  Do you have an explanation for all the high vote positive percentages on anti-clinton stuff?  That sort of discredits the notion that they're shilling.

       This subreddit consistently allows right-wing conspiracy theories to reach the top.  The comments usually criticize those theories.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's a good explanation for that; right-leaning members (T_D'ers) upvote blindly and don't do much critical thinking, and the left-leaning redditors like to argue.
      </p>
      <p>
       If this subreddit was being shilled, why are they allowing those theories so much exposure?
      </p>
      <p>
       They have plausible deniability; reddit is left-leaning and the government is right-leaning, so it would make sense for a conspiracy theory subreddit to criticize things that support the establishment (or criticize its enemies)
      </p>
      <p>
       Why allow exposure to those ideas?  Why not censor
       <em>
        all
       </em>
       the theories, and only allow the
       <em>

       They either can't shill that hard (doubtful), are not allocating as many resources here as elsewhere, or are fine tuning their impact to keep the subreddit active while causing us to sit here and debate shilling rather than actual crimes by the right and left in our government.
      </p>
      <p>
       There isn't a single strategy for shilling, that's obvious. They have to modify their plan for each demographic. I imagine a community as skeptical as the core of this subreddit (excluding some of the less free thinking TD folks) takes a very careful touch.

       I'm still not buying it.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are a
       <em>
        lot
       </em>
       of people who are interested in conspiracy theories from the new administration; the politics subreddit is full of them now.
      </p>
      <p>
       But like I pointed out; the patterns in this subreddit are exactly what I would expect without shilling.  Trump-heavy headlines, anti-trump heavy comments.  And as I
       <em>
        also
       </em>
       pointed out, we
       <strong>
        have
       </strong>
       shareblue's playbook and they have detailed tactics, none of which involve astroturfing.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm looking at this from the perspective of a conspirator.  Sell me "shilling".  What can you say that would convince me to put this in my budget?
      </p>
      <p>
       So I'm CTR now.  You're Soros.  What am I saying?  Conspiracy has got a small vocal userbase who spreads stories on facebook.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why do we care about that?  Well, the spread of "fake news" lost Hillary the election, so we want to corner that demographic.
      </p>
      <p>
       Great.  That means we want the headlines.  You, George Soros will pay for that.  Now we have a budget.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       But that's not what I'm seeing.  The headlines belong to Trump.  We've only got liberals in the comments.  The "headline readers" demographic was the big liberal weakness last election.  It would make sense that these patterns are represented here, but only if it wasn't being shilled.  Astroturfing groups should be putting Trump/Russia headlines at the top every day.
      </p>
      <p>
       And yet, they're not doing that.
      </p>
      <p>
       So why isn't CTR interested in the things I thought they care about?  Why is it they're using the methods you're describing instead?
      </p>
      <p>
       Pretend I'm Soros and you're CTR.  Can you sell me your conspiracy?

       I mean, I take it as a top down approach (Soros went to Brock), and a constantly evolving strategy.

       The beauty of a subreddit like this is that no one really resents you for having a differing perspective. If you choose to disbelieve in shilling, by all means, continue to.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have observed the changes in this and other subreddits and have concluded that they participate here and elsewhere. You have not concluded the same thing. Neither of us know for certain, and that's ok.
      </p>
      <p>
       I respect your logic and understand where​ you're coming from, but I disagree that CTR is absent or nearly absent from this subreddit.
      </p>
      <p>
       You did bring up some good points that new blood could have entered the subreddit as a result of the Russia conspiracies spread by the msm. Regardless of the nature of the truth or fabrication of the claims, that could have an impact on the demographics.
      </p>
      <p>
       We have gotten a bit off from the original topic. I have a problem with any and all partisan posts, because they have a tendency to divide us more than bring us together.  The only way we can defeat any and all of our oppressors is to band together and find common ground. Partisan posts undermine that, especially for people who struggle to keep an open mind.

       I was just thinking about this the other day. The CTR manual was leaked and it was a huge story for like one day and then everyone completely stopped talking about it. Like, it should have been a huge breakthrough trumpeted forever by all the CTR-obsessives. Instead it just totally stopped being discussed whatsoever. I had to look it up to make sure I wasn't misremembering.

       Of course, the issue was that it never said anything about astro-turfing. So everyone just ignored it.

       Perhaps, but that has more to do with the fact that when you compare criminality, Donald Trump doesn't even come close to HRC's baggage.  You also have to remember the DNC leaks, which featured prominently in this sub for a while, and Pizzagate which is still a dominant topic and which, at least in a tertiary manner links to HRC.  There was simply nothing on the other side of the coin to compete....though CT Blue or whatever the fuck they call themselves sure tried to make it seem otherwise.

       Like I said, there are shills coming in here from all sides.  I never suggested it was only Share Blue/CTR.  The Donald's crowd has been a little smarter in keeping whichever companies are doing it close to the vest....but their tactics give them away just the same.

       the purpose of this sub shouldn't be another echo chamber for rpolitics, worldnews, when we have the whole front page littered with that nonsense. I also imagine many people who are pushing the anti trump narrative aren't even genuine.

       It goes beyond what you're trying to say. We will never have a neutral subreddit that bolster discussion from all sides. I rather we keep it "unique" and from turning into another CTR/shill subreddit.

       majority? I guess you can call it the minority. If it was the majority we'd be overrun by anti trump stuff you do realise that. Again if you want to talk about any trump conspiracy why not go to the subreddits i mention. They put all anti trump stuff under the microscope. In fact they probably do a better job than most conspiracy theorists. So what's the problem?

       every subreddit that is loosely moderated eventually turns out to be an echo chamber of sorts. rconspiracy is a battle ground. im fine with the anti-trump-to-other ratio posts in this subreddit. i can also look elsewhere instantly if i was interested in donald trump Russian propaganda.

       I think I can say why this happened. Why a lot of people were denying the credibility of the WikiLeaks and if they were legitimate, this sub was diving into them while the media was attempting to sweep it under the rug.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, a large number of the users on this sub were getting blasted with WikiLeaks posts and formed an opinion about the government, the media, and the military industrial complex.

       I just don't understand why people are so willing to 100% dismiss Russian problems within our government but at the same time are skeptical about shit that aligns with their views.

      <p>
       We have a government literally lying nearly every single day and what looks to be actively trying to snuff out investigation of Russian influence. Why is demanding further investigation here on this sub such a problem?

       So since every other subreddit is a partisan shithole for the left, that means this sub needs to become a partisan shithole for the right(according to your logic)?
      </p>
      <p>
       Because, as this post clearly shows, it's well on its way to becoming that, if it isn't already. There's right-leaning and left-leaning conspiracy theories here. This sub is not meant to be a right-leaning sub nor left-leaning. Which means,
       <em>
        all
       </em>
       fucking conspiracies have merit regardless of which side of the fence they're on. Stop trying to discredit this one simply because it goes against the usual right agenda.

       If you think there is "absolutely no evidence the clintons are tied to pedophiles" then you have not looked at the
       <em>
        very clear evidence the clintons are tied to pedophiles as well as a disgusting amount of very real human trafficking incidents along with a stupid amount of blatant theft through the Clinton Foundation.

       You can't make blanket statements like that just like I'm not going to say the Clintons are twisted and I'm not ruling anything out in regards to Trump too. The people who have been controlling how we live our everyday lives have been getting away with a lot of fuckery for a very long time and the point is to hold them accountable, not pick sides and scream at each other while they continue on like there's nothing to see there.

       The objective seems to be a coordinated effort to make it seem like Trump isn't just a Russian puppet. Which has been obvious to anyone not willfully blind to it for the last 6 months, at least.

       Exactly. Just because reality may align with the ambitions of Darth Cheney doesn't mean we all have to decide it's a big hoax. For fuck's sake, Russia clearly meddled pretty heavily in our election, the full extent of which we don't even know. The gangsters in control of Russia may have public policy that aligns with the ambitions of Christian Dominionists in the US, but they are damned fools if they think that those gangsters aren't still actively undermining the west and trying to destabilize long held alliances so that they may improve their own standing in the world and re-take countries that split from them after the fall of Communist Russia. 
Most of us don't want a damned war, but something has to be done.
How many business ties to Russia and how much kissing Russian ass do we need to see from the Trump administration before these Trump apologists pull their heads out of their asses and see that there is at the very least something worth investigating here?

       They've been saying for months now that being against Trump means you want WW3. It's asinine.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why does acknowledging that Russia had an interest in influencing our election, and very likely did so, start World War 3? It's insane.

       I think it is a corruption of their office's duty to represent the citizenry...and yes, I know that is not the same definition used legally or otherwise

       I am not trying to win Internet cool pts here; I am genuinely concerned that none of the organs or bodies within the government  have the desire or ability to root out the corruption (returning to the legal def.) and undue influences

       The Republican healthcare bill is a great example; the party spent 8 years decrying the dangers and injustice of the ACA and then put forward a plan that is arguably worse. They will try to sell it as a repeal, it isn't; they will claim their constituents won't loose coverage, they will; they would rather leave a neutered and limping bureaucratic nightmare than put their political livelihood at risk

       No, that's still corruption. If I were hanging out with a group of friends that wanted to rob a store, but I was against it, then pressured to go along with them, then I'm still part of that robbery.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's why most politicians are corrupt, because if you don't want to be part of the game you don't play or get anything done.
      </p>
      <p>
       And to claim most have not taken part in corruption...well just look how many laws have been passed in favor of big business and ones in favor of the US citizen.

       Try drinking only water and eating real food, and getting regular exercise. That will help you feel better eventually (it will take some time). After that, study to ensure you are worthy. Train to ensure you are ready.

       This "end is neigh" narrative that's on repeat needs to stop. Sure we could agree that there are early warning signs that America is on the way out as the leading super power, but that isn't going to happen overnight. And this doomsday culture that shows up in these threads makes everyone involved look foolish. I'm all for getting in on the circle jerk that cheney is a piece of shit but saying life as we know it is about to be over is a load of shit.

       I don't think it's going to end but I know the possibility is there and that it can happen easily if we ignore the people who know better, the "intellectuals", on such an important topic. Intellectuals have been ignored throughout history on their area of expertise but the cost of them being ignored would never have cost us all life on earth until relatively recently. All it takes is one fuck up.

       There were times when Americans were more civically minded, now that just happens after terror attacks.
      </p>
      <p>
       The real point is that Americans have no commonly shared values aside from narcissistic self-interest and consumerism. This is why the mindless rabid nationalism fostered by Trump and Bush has been such a popular and powerful united force.

       Compared to pretty much any other industrialized (and even many developing) societies that have an interest in that concept most feared by the parasitic elite, "the common good". (For examples of countries that uphold the common good see; Northern Europe, India, China, Syria, Bolivia, Ecuador, pre-2011 Libya, etc.)

       This is why I used the the qualifier "more" I didn't mean to imply every single American. An example that immediately comes to mind would be the popularity of some of FDR's social reforms. Or the 95% approval rating Bush held for a brief time post 9/11.  I'd also argue the post-war boom and the subsequent rise of the American standard of living was wildly influential to modern patriotism.

       There were other times as well, but support for some of those instances were assuredly brought about by mass manipulation. Were these upswings in civic responsibility genuine organic grassroots movements, or manufactured by social engineering and propaganda? In most cases, a combination of the two, but most often dependent upon the latter.

       Before some ctr shill comes through and claims this is whataboutism in order to discredit the idea, I believe everyone should understand the difference here. Trump has made a business of building hotels, probably with the assistance of the mafia and who knows what other kinds of shitty things. But when you are trying to talk about the scale of wrongdoing, Trump would need to commit a second holocaust in order to catch up with what Cheney has done to date.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, let's not pretend like it is ok to be on Cheney's side now, just because it is opposite of Trump's side. We can be mad at 2 things at the same time. If you live your life just always doing the opposite of the people you don't like, you are not living your own life. You are just acting out a derivative of the person's you hate.
      </p>
      <p>
       Plus, if you protested the inhumanity of Bush II's regime, but are on Cheney's side out of political convenience now, you are at best a fraud.

       The only way to be a free thinker is to give Dick Cheney complete control over what you believe (in this case by believing the exact opposite).
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm approximately 100 percent sure that if Dick Cheney said "there's nothing to see here with Russia" that none of these people would be changing their opinion despite currently insisting that everyone else do the same.

       I disagree, here is what I see,  The group responsible for our now entirely extremist conservative Republican government want the U.S. to separate from NATO and the EU trade agreements, and align the U.S. with Russia including Russia's allies Syria and Iran.
       <br/>
       Both our current U.S. conservative leaders and Putin think EU is too democratic socialist, ideas the oligarchs want stamped out.
      </p>
      <p>
       So the new global economic and political alignment would be:
      </p>
      <p>
       Russia and their puppets, the U.S.A., Iran, Syria, etc
      </p>
      <p>
       Vs
      </p>
      <p>
       Europe, China,
      </p>
      <p>
       UK, Australia, New Zealand, are actually as compromised as the U.S. on this, and Canada well on the way.
      </p>
      <p>
       With that kind of alignment, where would you put Japan and India?

       The US has sanctions on Russia.  The US wants to corral China.  The US wants to remain the dominant power in the world. In order for the US to do that it has to keep ALL nations down. So the US competes against everyone.  The US invaded Iraq in 2003 because it was selling oil in EURO money.  Iran had this idea to create a "euro-based oil Bourse"
       <strong>
        October 2014

       Hence the lie of Iran's nukes "WMD 2.0"

       And so the US is for countries to leave the EU. England left. Obama wanted Britain to leave, he couldn't say it publicly. The euro currency is second to the dollar as a world reserve currency and so the US is making moves against all. The US moved against "BRICS* too. We saw it in Brazil.

       These two articles (obviously there are more writings that add to it) explain more or less what is going on. Even tho these articles are a few years old, it's still in play.  Things take time, but I suppose the end result you want isn't always gauranteed.  There are usually a number of factors involved, it's never just
       <em>
        one thing.
       </em>
       If you connect those things you'd see that they fit perfectly together and than you see the picture.  It's like that kids game of connect the dots, since life isn't a sequence of random events.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not trying to convince you though.  Understanding geopolitics is very matrixy.  You'd have to be "awake" as they say, for you to believe and understand and accept the truth. US officials even write about their foreign policy goals, usually in "think tanks" and these people also serve in government posts.

       India and Japan will probably join Russia and China when all is said and done, once the Asian BLOC is completed. There's SCO and the EEU. Those are powerful blocs, SCO probably more so.

       Have you considered that most people have already made up their mind in regards to what they think about the russia scandal, and that what Cheney thinks or says is completely irrelevant to that?
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean, I can only speak for myself here, but I honestly just don't give two shits what Cheney thinks. If he happens to agree that Russia hacked the DNC, so be it. Doesn't matter to me. Because I didn't make my conclusions based on what some politician told me, I came to my conclusions based on available digital evidence and the testimony of dozens of high ranking officials and experts.

       Cheney is no broken clock. He is a manipulative, cunning, lying criminal.  He doesnt accidentally get things right.  He intentionally misleads, lies and conspires.  You are now aligned with him, agreeing with him and promoting his lies.

       And the available evidence clearly points to Russia hacking the DNC for the purposes of influencing our election.

       I think Trump should do prison time for the fraud he committed with his fake "university". I hate Trump for his bigoted scapegoating, and I disagree with his policy positions on almost everything. But the Russia-Trump connection allegations by the CIA and Democratic Party are based on NO EVIDENCE even though if the allegations were true, it would be a simple matter to produce evidence. In addition to the violations of the 4th amendment that affect us all, they've had Trump and his team under surveillance, and still, they cannot produce evidence and even readily admit that there is no evidence is pressed.

       Apart the rest of your nonsense, you would have to be blind or intentionally obtuse to think this isn't a pro-trump post. Just read the title. Almost everyone here is ant-cheney (I haven't seen a single person be "pro-cheney" though there problem is someone). The title very clearly implies that since dick cheney says there are is likely Trump-Russian collusion that you should automatically disregard it. It's disingenuous to say it isn't trump propoganda

       When Alex Jones apologized for peddling pizzagate, he was brushed aside as someone who got to him/controlled opposition.   But now Chaney says something about Trump and it automatically means it's all bullshit.  Interesting.

       He's been under investigation for months. He and his team has been under surveillance over baseless allegations. There's still no evidence, even though producing evidence would be a simple task for the surveillance state if it existed.
      </p>
      <p>
       And before you try it, I hate Trump, he's a bigoted idiot, scam artist, scumbag, criminal, etc. I even believe the allegations of the woman who said Trump raped her when she was 13 years old. There's just no evidence that he has any illicit ties to Russia.

       No one really cares about Dick Cheneys opinion on this matter, he even mentioned in the interview that he was speaking for himself. But some of you guys are trying really hard to discredit the Trump-Russia investigations, so I guess you will try anything. Also OP makes the equivalence of supporting the Russia-Trump investigations to ushering in the start of WW3, the fearmongering is pathetic and really shows how much the_donald controls this sub.

       You guys don't realize that you are allying with the deep state and neo-cons just to oppose Trump? All the MSN? George Soros. Koch brothers? Dont you see a blatant coordinated effort to want to impeach him and they are using this Russia narrative for this cause? CIA director is directly threatening Trump and CIA/NSA is intersecting his phone calls. And this is coming from someone that didn't vote for Trump, but this is pretty blatant.

       So the lying by the AG about the Russians, Trumps ex Campaign manager Paul Manafort ties with the Russians, Mike Flynns ties to the Russians, Trumps foreign investments.  Obviously these are all fake news, everybody is making it all up because deep state controls everything. If the president is actively ignoring facts and denouncing intelligence agencys, no shit they're not playing nice with the white house. You have a potentially compromised sitting president who has made outlandish claims, insulted allies, berates intelligence, but will barely criticize Russia, and you wonder why our intelligence agencys dont trust him. To end this, there are connections between Trumps campaign and Russia, they're may have been no criminal wrongdoing but that is to be decided after a thorough investigation, denying all existing facts out there and just yelling conspiracy does help to no one.

       Wtf is 'ties with Russia', do you not see how little substance there is in those words? Which are carefully chosen just to pile up connections to create a narrative? If a congressman ever speaks with Russians then you can claim he has 'ties with Russia'. If a senator had dinner with any ex-Russian representatives, then he has 'ties with Russians'.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can play this game with virtually anyone if you decided to look hard enough.  Russia is the second superpower in the planet, of course your going to get in touch with them at some point. Just because your receiving your conspiracy from the MSN doesn't make it more valid than most conspiracy theories, in fact I'll say it's worse because they are owned and are notoriously known for being mouthpieces of the establishment.

       Your right ignore the other superpower that is being run by a ex KGB agent that has made billions off his country, terrible human rights record, and has been known to blackmail/murder people to get what he wants. Bending over backwards to ignore all the different connections and saying its fake, with no proof to back it up, just circumstantial deep state bullshit. What kind of evidence would change your mind to make you agree that Russia did manipulate our election and may have coordinated with the Trump campaign?

       I agree with the first part, don't know what that has to with what I said since I wasn't defending Putin. Do you know that saying that he is in fact a human rights abuser and not believing Trump is Putin's puppet secretly working to undermine our government is possible right? These are not mutually exclusive.
      </p>
      <p>
       About your second part, how about some solid evidence? 
It's just funny to me the certain conspiracy theory elitism that the media and many people have, almost as if you were an absolute idiot or  delusional 'Trumpet' for not believing in their particular conspiracy theory.

       I can not give less of a fuck about the Russia shit. I do not like trump, but There is no substance to that. His opponent literally sold uranium to Russia and profited from it. Trump is no different than every other piece of shit in Washington, he is just 10 years outdated on his PCness. This is all fucking madness, god damn democrats pushing Russia shit like they are republicans in the 50s. Dick riding the CIA like its the last dick to ride out of hell. Republicans who have for the most part called for assanges death idolizing him now, also somehow  are all concerned about women's and gay rights (if Islam is in the pic). Then both sides on their knees taking turns sucking comeys cock depending on whatever he said that day. I mean fuck, I am a fairly liberal guy, but everyone needs to go fuck themselves.

       This is the first comment i make in r/conspiracy and I'm not even from the US. I always read from Trump supporters (or people that seem to be Trump supporters) that they fear WWIII will come if people continue with this Russian narrative. Do this same people fear WWIII with China will come with Trump's agressive trade talk and foreign policy in the pacific?

       Speaking as someone who hates Trump and was banned from r/the_donald for saying I agreed with Trump when he said we needed universal healthcare, jk3hybrid is right here. We've always had plenty of useful idiots that bought into Trump. Not paid shills, fools who honestly believe Trump's lies. And is it surprising? Trump has argued in favor of multiple conspiracy theories in the past, most notably his racist claims that Obama's birth certificate was fake. He's also successfully cultivated an image of being against "the establishment", mostly thanks to the way the media gave him all that ridiculous coverage before/during the primaries, setting him up to be Clinton's opponent in the general. People who are drawn to r/conspiracy are more likely to be on Trump's side from the beginning, but these obvious anti-Trump astroturfers like to claim that anyone who likes Trump is paid to. Roughly one-in-four people in the USA voted for Trump, but these liars really expect people to believe that anyone that likes Trump here is hired by the Russian government or something.

       Hey, Afrobean, um there is something you should know my friend. There are multiple document examiners who have sworn affidavits to the fact that the document Obama put up on the whitehouse website that was left in a format called pdf, was actually tampered with.   You can pull it  apart in photoshop. The only way this can happen is if it was put together in this way. Not one expert will come forward claiming it is legit.

       I don't think I've seen a single person use Dick Cheney's opinion on the matter as a credible talking point. I know it's hard to believe sometimes, especially people in this sub, but people have autonomy and their own agenda to occupy. Cheney has always been an imperialist neo-con so it shouldn't surprise anyone when he signals for war. His lack of credibility only affects his opinion, it shouldn't affect the credibility of the story he comments on however.

       There are sockpuppets all around. Try considering the logic of the argument of the possible sockpuppet before simply dismissing it due to it being a sockpuppet. It's good to be mindful and aware as you seem to be, but I find it troublesome when someone seems to try to silence someone who didn't say anything wrong. Also, the op has plenty of karma despite no comment/post history, so it's clear that they merely delete their stuff after posting it.

       No one believes anything lol. No trump is bad no Obama is bad. No Hilary is good. No she might be bad . Dick was bad until his stance aligned with the current narrative that's being pushed against the current admin. People wanna believe that there side is right so bad that any sign of cognitive dissonance makes then adjust there view around fucking bullshit articles. Bullshit articles that wrriten by the same people that either are brainwashed or are in on it. On top of that we regard these articles as the gospel. We have no idea what's said behind closed doors or what's really going on. All we see and hear is legal talk , not what they really sound like. I dont trust anything said and I never will. Have fun in your matrix

       Yea, I think the government is going into overdrive with creating a totally astroturfed internet. And AI will be when we lose our small bits of internet freedom left. Then AI will start to be used in our legal system.. I don't even know what to call where we are heading.. We are already in 1984.

       Uhh how is it a conspiracy? His campaign manager is famous for getting a Russian puppet elected in Ukrain. Even if there is no collusion, its bad enough that the President admires a man like Putin and wants to emulate him. That alone is enough to earn our distrust and contempt.

       At least Obama was willing to lie to make people feel good though. He promised so many things that people desperately needed and wanted, he promised to actually represent the will of the people for once. The Democratic Party is unwilling to even tell those lies anymore. Obama campaigned on the idea of getting everyone healthcare, Clinton campaigned bragging about how "single payer will never ever come to pass!" They used to lie to make the constituents feel good and support them, now they lie to warmonger and attempt to rationalize Clinton's ridiculous, embarrassing defeat. If the Democrats lied like Obama did in 2008, I'm pretty sure they would have won in 2016.

       Forget where you stand on Trump and google "Genie Energy", "Afek oil and Gas", and "Golan Heights".  It's been talked about here before and it's not even that deep of a rabbit hole.  Cheney is one of the three men who would benefit most from a war with Russia.  He is deliberately using you're hatred for the president to send more of your kids to war for his oil.

       I like that story where Putin moved in and arrested that one oligarch that was going to give away half of all of Russia's oil. 
"In 2003, a defining geopolitical event occurred when Putin had billionaire oligarch, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, arrested on charges of tax evasion and put his shares in giant Yukos Oil group under state control."
His arrest also came after a report surfaced about a meeting with Dick Cheney in Washington, followed by others with ExxonMobil and ChevronTexaco. They discussed acquiring a major stake of up to 40% of Yukos or enough to give Washington and Big Oil “de facto veto power over future Russian oil and gas pipelines and oil deals.” Khodorkovsky also met with GHW Bush and had ties to the Carlyle Group, the influential US firm with figures like James Baker one of its partners."
       <strong>
        By late 2004, Moscow understood that a New Cold War was on over “strategic energy control and unilateral nuclear primacy,” and Putin moved from defense to a “new dynamic offensive aimed at securing a more viable geopolitical position by using (Russia’s) energy as the lever.”

       I just don't understand why people are so willing to 100% dismiss Russian problems within our government but at the same time are skeptical about shit that aligns with their views.

       We have a government literally lying nearly every single day and what looks to be actively trying to snuff out investigation of Russian influence. Why is demanding further investigation here on this sub such a problem?

       Your right ignore the other superpower that is being run by a ex KGB agent that has made billions off his country, terrible human rights record, and has been known to blackmail/murder people to get what he wants. Bending over backwards to ignore all the different connections and saying its fake, with no proof to back it up, just circumstantial deep state bullshit. What kind of evidence would change your mind to make you agree that Russia did manipulate our election and may have coordinated with the Trump campaign?

       Spoofing an IP address is a lot different than using a VPN which I was suggesting, a good VPN that doesn't track your data would be almost impossible to find out where they are coming from.

      <p>
       Let's say you are right about this classification, then we should demand it anyways, we deserve to have proof for these acquisitions because if they did release it they would stop these nonsensical arguments we are having here, but they won't because THIS IS WHAT THEY WANT. The biggest problem I have is that EVERYONE ADMITS that Russia is ONLY A LIKELY SUSPECT, yet what is the media narrative. That Russia, "Hacked the election." That doesn't remotely describe the situation and no one outside of a very few people know
      </p>
      <p>
       a) What exactly was hacked, b) the method of hacking let alone why Russia is the likely suspect, people just throw it off as fact because "NYT said so" or "WaPost says so." This herd mentality is what leads to endless wars that the people think they are in the name of "freedom." Read Brave New World if you want to see what that leads to.
      </p>

       I don't see how these things relate at all to anything classified because they aren't.
