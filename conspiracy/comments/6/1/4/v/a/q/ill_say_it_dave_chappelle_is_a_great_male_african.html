        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>**Dave Chappelle is a great role model for the African American youth. He has a way of disarming the &quot;SJW&quot; types with his down to earth analysis of &quot;touchy&quot; issues by using comedy. </p>

<p>In a time where the black youth idolize corporate hip hop music that is largely void of any substance or message about the plight of African Americans (Like myself), he is  redpilling the masses with his comedy and interviews, and spreading a message of peace, while also exposing the establishment. Check out his new comedy specials on Netflix if you get a chance. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow dude, you are taking his way out of context...</p>

<p>I&#39;m saying that he&#39;s a great African American Role model for the black youth. The black youth have been largely corrupted by the establishment, forced into the bad neighborhoods, drugs forced on their communities, and the glorification of hip hop music that ultimately praises murder and love of material objects and gangs and shit like disrespecting your community ect. We NEED role models like that for the African American community in this time, thats why I&#39;m pointing it out. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lol, this guy is honestly trying to convince us he&#39;s black.  No black person would say Dave Chappelle is a great African American role model.  Also, referring to yourself as african american is weird for black people.  Also, the title of this post.. &quot;I&#39;ll say it&quot; as if he is somehow brave for speaking about a black person in a positive light, probably because he isn&#39;t black and clearly has a poor view of black people as a hole - the fact that their youth (all of them) are submerged in &quot;bad&quot; music culture and the fact that African Americans (all of them) need a role model - a comedian.  This was comical.</p>

<p>&quot;Dave Chapelle is a great role model for the <strong>African American youth&quot;.</strong></p>

<p>That is the problem. Your post implies that African American youth cannot look up to people who are not the same color as them. The color of his skin have nothing to do with people being able to look up to him or not and it isn&#39;t needed unless you want to needlessly divide people.</p>

<p>What difference does it make what color he is or his ethnicity if you believe in his message? People generally take offense to this because there is no reason to split people up in this manner. It does nothing but cause problems. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You misunderstand the situation. He&#39;s blabbing about corrupt officials that run American politics that have complete control over all of Americas problem by disenfranchising the Latin American, African American and Muslim communities through a default bias that says things are fine the way they are so don&#39;t meddle with it. Your better off with the evil you know than the one you don&#39;t mentality. They&#39;ve even reverted so far as to force 80-90% (since 5 of 6 companies are left wing we&#39;ll use that estimate) of the media to the masses to promote the nihilist approach of &quot;Tear it all down&quot; &quot;Anarchy&quot; &quot;Resist!!&quot; now. They changed tactics on the chess board and scrapped one technique for the exact opposite fallacy because their plan was destroyed. Be woke. Even if you don&#39;t trust Trump that is fair as long as you find it fair to assume that it is common knowledge that viewpoints are distorted by the corrupt through MSM.</p>

<p>His piece on &quot;flushing bin Laden down the ocean&quot; is classic.</p>

<p>Inside said rabbit hole one can also find another beautiful moment; Louis CK asking Donald Rumsfeld if he is a lizard live on air, the subsequent avoiding of an answer, and then the ten minutes of comedy gold that occur after the call has ended. </p>

<p>Also if you have been paying attention he has developed a whole new slew of ego problems and all this extra &quot;I&#39;M A REAL MAN&quot; shit is most certainly to compensate for some internal worries, whether they are founded in reality or not haha.</p>

<p>Joe has lost touch with his true self and could really do with another psychedelic journey beyond a tab of acid.</p>

<p>For a dude as experienced as himself it&#39;s  unfortunate to watch him allow his ego to reconstruct into something so self limiting.</p>

<p>Not to say he isn&#39;t successful but he certainly he limits himself due to certain stigmas, most likely from his surrounding peers and co-workers.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>One things for sure...</p>

<p>A year ago none of my friends were aware that this SJW crap was part of a control mechanism but I&#39;m having conversation on the matter weekly at this point in both my personal life and on line.</p>

<p>I now have friends who were previously &quot;feminists&quot; completely moving away from the concept as they are beginning to realize it nothing but a divisive term.</p>

<p>I am also seeing an increase in awareness from my friends in family in regards to the CIA leaks and privacy issues.</p>

<p>I know many people who are switching search engines, covering there cameras and even flat out making a point of holding conversation away from microphones in there house.</p>

<p>What was once seen as paranoia is becoming commons sense now.</p>

<p>Regardless of whether this guy has observed these changes or not they are happening and as they continue to swell a sea of change will envelop the world.</p>

<p>That&#39;s not to say we should expect drastic change over night but there is definitely marked progress in the average intelligence and awareness levels.</p>

<p>I hardly think the responses on in this thread equate to an accurate poll.</p>

<p>You being unawares of something doesn&#39;t dictate reality.</p>

<p>It means you are living in your OWN bubble.</p>

<p>We all live in a bubble bub.</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t say that everyone in america was having this conversation, I said that more and more people are day by day and if you want to deny that then it&#39;s to your own detriment.</p>

<p>You can narrative shape all you want but I&#39;m gonna keep chugging right along with reality and spreading awareness.</p>

<p>I suggest you do the same online and in your personal life and be the change that you supposedly wish was occurring.</p>

<p>I live in reality by not attempting to dictate the reality of others.</p>

<p>You are trying to tell me nothing has changed simply because you haven&#39;t observed it.</p>

<p>You are rejecting incoming information because it disagrees with your version of reality.</p>

<p>Do you think I am lying about my observations?</p>

<p>How would it benefit me to convey untrue information in regards to people waking up to these control tactics?</p>

<p>What reason have I given you to disagree?</p>

<p>Your reasoning seems to be based on my comments not reflecting what&#39;s going on within YOUR bubble.</p>

<p>The difference between us is that I fully expect you genuinely have not observed these differences in your personal life and time on the web and that is how you have arrived at your current opinion.</p>

<p>However... </p>

<p>You are refuting my own observations that come from outside your personal bubble... </p>

<p>You don&#39;t even know what kind of life I lead yet you attempt to shut down the conversation by attacking my character with your ad hominem.</p>

<p>One of us here is most definitely close minded here...</p>

Sure, there is a lot of garbage hip hop that focuses on spending money and hoes, but why are we hyperfocused on hip hop?  There is absolute garbage in all music categories.  No one talks about country being void of substance or a message, when a lot of it is about drinking and fucking.

    <div class="md"><p>He is, to me, the King of the Punchline. In addition to enjoying his comedy, I want to analyze how he tells jokes. This is how, I think, Chappelle constructs his jokes: He tells a long premise, a premise that is very human, something which Joe Public can easily end up doing in his life, and/or something which makes Chappelle seem like a swell fellow. Then, there&#39;s a brief pause. Then, a fantastic twist, where he raises his voice and does a 180 by telling a completely impossible situation through which the now obviously false premise hilariously breaks apart.</p>

<p>You are trying to tell me nothing has changed simply because you haven&#39;t observed it.</p>

<p>The difference between us is that I fully expect you genuinely have not observed these differences in your personal life and time on the web and that is how you have arrived at your current opinion.</p>
