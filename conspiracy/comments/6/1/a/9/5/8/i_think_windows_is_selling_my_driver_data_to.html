I had kept the little usb device in my laptop the whole time. Yesterday, I dropped my laptop and it landed on the wireless mouse driver shattering it.  I get the notification that the driver has failed. So now today I log into facebook and see this ad staring at me. I had not made on searches about a replacement part, i have never even searched anything about the mouse swear on it. Yet here is a targeted advertisement for the exact replacement driver I would need.  Heres the screencap of the ad <a href="http://imgur.com/a/ZEDlc">http://imgur.com/a/ZEDlc</a></p>

<p>I was in best buy with my girlfriend a month ago and she was looking at the Dyson hairdryer. The next day on my ads, there it was the same hairdryer...</p>

<p>They are always listening!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Absolutely. I got creeped out last week when one of those red bull girls handing out free drinks. When I got home, I got an ad on YouTube for the exact same kind of Red Bull. No searching. They could have listened on my phone&#39; mic, or tracked my location. Freaky stuff </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do some tests. Talk about some products you&#39;ve never gotten ads for, and see if ads show up. </p>

<p>I think there is a lot of growing evidence that your mic is used by apps (maybe even OS&#39;s) to listen to you. I haven&#39;t really looked into it that deeply, but from what I have read it seems likely. And it&#39;s not like the companies making software have proven themselves above this kind of shit. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Did you talk about it out loud near your phone or computer? A lot of people have said they get ads from Facebook from conversations that the mic unknowingly picked up or from their text messages.</p>

<p>Facebook hijacks everything it can to collect as much data from you and everyone you communicate with.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was eating an apple one day, with my puppy by my side. I said to my dog, &quot;no, I don&quot;t think you should eat an apple, it might not be good for your stomach.&quot;</p>

It&#39;s just creepy. No one needs this shit, Google. Knock it off!</p>

<p>Well, when I went to the hotel&#39;s desktop to open the weather, the exact laptop was in an Amazon ad on the page. Even the color I wanted.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been having bizarre and creepy experiences with my phone, specifically on the Pandora radio app.</p>

<p>First I wore a shirt for a band I used to listen to a lot of, the radio hardly played their music. That day they played it almost non stop.</p>

<p>Second, I was talking with a friend at the gym. We were doing italian accents and suddenly the app plays an ad for Italian subs.</p>

<p>Then it starts getting weirder. I&#39;ve been thinking about getting a shave for a few days, looking in the mirror at the gym at my face. An ad for shaving razors pops up.</p>

<p>Just today, I was thinking about a band I haven&#39;t heard in months. Pandora magically plays a song that same day despite never playing them.</p>

<p>Could be coincidences but still bizarre and creepy as fuck in my opinion.</p>
