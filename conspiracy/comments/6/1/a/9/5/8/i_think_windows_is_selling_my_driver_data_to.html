       I just had the creepiest moment of browsing the web in my life. About 3 months ago I purchased, in cash, a Logitech wireless mouse. I had kept the little usb device in my laptop the whole time. Yesterday, I dropped my laptop and it landed on the wireless mouse driver shattering it.  I get the notification that the driver has failed. So now today I log into facebook and see this ad staring at me. I had not made on searches about a replacement part, i have never even searched anything about the mouse swear on it. Yet here is a targeted advertisement for the exact replacement driver I would need.  Heres the screencap of the ad

       Well they have access to everything doesn't surprise me. There isn't much ANY of us can do against the new CIA spying revelations...I am going to be using Tor, VPN's, taping cameras and mics. But how do we actually stop them?

       Do you think Windows is spyware because of the CIA, or because it's Microsoft. We know that intel already puts backdoors in all their processors so they are covering all bases!

       Both. I think it benefits Microsoft to do targeted advertising, and the CIA/NSA has agreements with them to let them use Microsoft's platform to spy on everyone.

       Absolutely. I got creeped out last week when one of those red bull girls handing out free drinks. When I got home, I got an ad on YouTube for the exact same kind of Red Bull. No searching. They could have listened on my phone' mic, or tracked my location. Freaky stuff

       Do some tests. Talk about some products you've never gotten ads for, and see if ads show up.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think there is a lot of growing evidence that your mic is used by apps (maybe even OS's) to listen to you. I haven't really looked into it that deeply, but from what I have read it seems likely. And it's not like the companies making software have proven themselves above this kind of shit.

       Did you talk about it out loud near your phone or computer? A lot of people have said they get ads from Facebook from conversations that the mic unknowingly picked up or from their text messages.
      </p>
      <p>
       Facebook hijacks everything it can to collect as much data from you and everyone you communicate with.

       I was eating an apple one day, with my puppy by my side. I said to my dog, "no, I don"t think you should eat an apple, it might not be good for your stomach."
      </p>
      <p>
       I go to google something later that day and what do I see.  First thing that comes up in the search bar- Is it ok to feed a dog apples?

       I was shopping for a laptop on my my phone at work. And working for a hotel, we get thousands of people a month on our internet.

       Well, when I went to the hotel's desktop to open the weather, the exact laptop was in an Amazon ad on the page. Even the color I wanted.

       I've been having bizarre and creepy experiences with my phone, specifically on the Pandora radio app.
      </p>
      <p>
       First I wore a shirt for a band I used to listen to a lot of, the radio hardly played their music. That day they played it almost non stop.
      </p>
      <p>
       Second, I was talking with a friend at the gym. We were doing italian accents and suddenly the app plays an ad for Italian subs.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then it starts getting weirder. I've been thinking about getting a shave for a few days, looking in the mirror at the gym at my face. An ad for shaving razors pops up.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just today, I was thinking about a band I haven't heard in months. Pandora magically plays a song that same day despite never playing them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Could be coincidences but still bizarre and creepy as fuck in my opinion.
