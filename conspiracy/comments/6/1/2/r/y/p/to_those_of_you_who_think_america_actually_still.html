        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>&quot;<strong>There is no such a thing in America as an independent press, unless it is out in country towns. You are all slaves. You know it, and I know it. There is not one of you who dares to express an honest opinion. If you expressed it, you would know beforehand that it would never appear in print.</strong></p>

<p><strong>&quot;I am paid $150 for keeping honest opinions out of the paper I am connected with. Others of you are paid similar salaries for doing similar things. If I should allow honest opinions to be printed in one issue of my paper, I would be like Othello before twenty-four hours: my occupation would be gone.</strong> The man who would be so foolish as to write honest opinions would be out on the street hunting for another job.</p>

<p>&quot;<strong>The business of a New York journalist is to distort the truth, to lie outright, to pervert, to villify, to fawn at the feet of Mammon, and to sell his country and his race for his daily bread</strong>, or for what is about the same — his salary. </p>

<p>&quot;You know this, and I know it; and what foolery to be toasting an &quot;Independent Press&quot;!  <strong>We are the tools and vassals of rich men behind the scenes. We are jumping-jacks. They pull the string and we dance. Our time, our talents, our lives, our possibilities, are all the property of other men.</strong></p>

<p><em>&quot;We are intellectual prostitutes.&quot;</em></p>

<ul>
<li>Journalist John Swinton, 1883 at a Press dinner</li>
</ul>

<p>134 years later, and nothing&#39;s changed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are three photos.  One shows a small group of maybe 5000 people.  The other 2 show closeups of maybe 20 people. Max.  Probably more like 10.</p>

<p>There were 1.5 MILLION people there.  The photos of that day are mindblowing.  <a href="http://livingresistance.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/582790b02f11b.jpg">http://livingresistance.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/582790b02f11b.jpg</a></p>

<p>It&#39;s like if the entirety of Times Square and everywhere between 5th and 8th Avenue was COMPLETELY full of people.  And you&#39;re going to tell me that a plaza with 5000 people is not misleading?  A story is more than words</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You claim they&#39;re using misleading photos. I disagreed.</p>

<p>They used a packed square for one cover photo of one article. The other photos within were of specific people and their signs, which coincides nicely with the content being discussed before and after those photos are in the text.</p>

<p>You make the whole thing about you by whining that they&#39;re misleading pictures. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m pretty sure it would be much bigger news if the mainstream media was telling people that a Satanic cult took over the South Korean presidency  and has been running the country.  Why?  Because it was obfuscated, glossed over and pretty much ignored by the US press at large.  Largely because the Satanists in the Korean government are part of the same group of Satanists in the Japanese and United States government as well.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I saw that news virtually everywhere. Also you have to realize that many people in the US simply do not care at all about the president of South Korea. If you had asked anyone in the US who the president was before the scandal broke I can guarantee that you they will most likely have no idea who it is, nor will they know who her replacement is. People in the US simply don&#39;t care that much about South Korea&#39;s leadership and they news will focus more on things people care about.</p>

<p>Also that whole scandal broke because of the news anyways.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m kinda split on this. On one hand, the MSM media (all of it, from CNN to MSNBC to Fox to Breitbart) is propaganda. They&#39;re just propaganda for different sides of the coin. And it&#39;s always been like this. Newspaper and media have never been independent and free of bias, it&#39;s just more obvious and pervasive now because we get the media everywhere, where as before you had to search more. They&#39;ve (the gov/TPTB/oligarchs) have always controlled the major media and used it as their mouthpiece.</p>

<p>On the other hand, there definitely are independent journalists. They may be small and hardly ever seen, but they are there. They aren&#39;t free from bias, but they may be free from control. </p>

<p>But for me the problem is, is which one of the small independent journalists are liars, truth seekers, or just attention whores? Are they truly independent, or do they only seem that way since they&#39;re so far removed from the MSM? Are they being honest in their reporting and facts, or are they just trying to spin a narrative for their story to get more views?</p>

<p>It&#39;s hard to tell. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s way more effective than state run news. The economic elites control the state and the press, and because it&#39;s harder to prove the connections, we tend to believe them more. Yet, they engage in video news releases, which amount to preproduced propaganda from industry and government, unchecked by the press. They censor stories that might negatively affect advertisers. Their advertisers can easily threaten to remove their funds to adjust behavior and we&#39;ll never hear about it. Most of them cite unnamed government officials as uncorruptable authorities or simply repeat their claims as fact. They beat the drums unison for war, like they did for Iraq 2003. </p>

<p>They keep working class interested voices off the air generally. They mostly kept Bernie Sanders off air while he was a viable potential candidate, until he lost the primary. Then he was allowed to go on TV more. The coverage they gave him before that was heavily biased against his candidacy. Hilary was obviously the preference of the media, of virtually all of the big outlets that wanted a Democrat. Some are biased toward Republicans, but they are even more corrupt, because their viewer base allows them to get away with it, due to shorter memories and greater ignorance. It&#39;s all relative though.</p>

<p>Managers and editors throw away stories that the owners wouldn&#39;t want published. The journalists learn what they can publish or they eventually get fired. It&#39;s a difficult to detect phenomenon reported by many real journalists as they left or got fired. </p>

<p>Perhaps the press will never be fully independent and honest. Ours is deceptively better than the worst out there. It makes us have a unmerited sense of confidence in its reporting.  </p>
