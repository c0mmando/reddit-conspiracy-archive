       I fear as a reaction to Trump and the alt-right etc, a white genocide will occur with militant SJW's leading the charge.

       Exactly. Anyone can hate anyone for any reason. Unfortunately, these ideals so easily gain traction and are only exacerbated by the media now. I don't care who you are; if you hate based on anything but someones actions, you're likely incorrect.

       Likewise, you can't blame someone for calling out hypocritical racists that don't think they themselves are racist just because they're not white. I've been mugged and had my apartment broken into purely because I was the only white guy living in that area. "White boy need to move out." is the threat that I heard every day trying to get inside to my apartment.

       I know you're concerned.. (borderline concern trolling tbh)

       But take a second to snap back to reality. It would
       <em>
        never

       be the SJWs, they are there to make the Right/Central/Libertarians mad and stir the pot.

       I've got 2000 rounds sitting in my living room. I go to the range every few weeks. Do you really think they would send the snowflakes?

       Let's be honest. If it came down to a civil war in America, It would be the illegal Mexicans facing deportation and the Muslims who have been treated poorly yet done nothing wrong. That's quite a few soldiers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Both groups have been mistreated (in their eyes) by the current system, they risked their lives to get here only to be told fuck off.

       <em>

       Check out the black panther movement from the 60s. They were armed too. And they freaked people out. We're OK and just get a little bit upset when white people walk around promoting open carry. Imagine if if were a predominantly black movement.

       The idea of concern trolling is being abused. It can and has be extended to cover anyone that questions anything inconvenient to someone else. It expects us to believe there is no situation where it is ok to be worried about the state of affairs.

      <p>
       I'm starting to woder if the idea of concern trolling isn't the actual forum sliding tactic.

       I only use "concern trolling" when the person is acting irrationally.

       I got that. What I said has been bouncing around in the back of my head since the election, and I just decided to let it out of there here to free up some space for cute cats and useless trivia. Pay me no mind.

       Oh okay. Yeah I hate the over use of it. It delegitimizes the term for when it's actually used by shills to derail subs.

       Jokes aside, there is no white genocide coming.
      </p>
      <p>
       "White people and western culture are the problem" is false. When a terrorist kills an American it's NOT because they "hate our culture" or whatever BS they say on TV. It's because they hate America-- the government that toppled stable regimes in the middle east and drone striked the hell out of their towns and homes and led to a generation of young men with no parents who are now radicalized/manipulated by terrorist groups because they want revenge.

       It's not because your skin is lighter than theirs.

       i agree, and i think the military industrial complex was a direct cause of a lot of destroyed lives over there for profit. northrup grumman and lockheed martin and more made bank on the war in Iraq, and now no one wants to own the consequences
