       Today, March 23rd 2017, WikiLeaks releases Vault 7
       <a href="https://wikileaks.org/vault7/darkmatter/releases/">
        "Dark Matter"
       </a>
       , which contains documentation for several CIA projects that infect Apple Mac Computer firmware (meaning the infection persists even if the operating system is re-installed) developed by the CIA's Embedded Development Branch (EDB). These documents explain the techniques used by CIA to gain 'persistence' on Apple Mac devices, including Macs and iPhones and demonstrate their use of EFI/UEFI and firmware malware.
      </p>
      <p>
       Among others, these documents reveal the "Sonic Screwdriver" project which, as explained by the CIA, is a "mechanism for executing code on peripheral devices while a Mac laptop or desktop is booting" allowing an attacker to boot its attack software for example from a USB stick "even when a firmware password is enabled". The CIA's "Sonic Screwdriver" infector is stored on the modified firmware of an Apple Thunderbolt-to-Ethernet adapter.
      </p>
      <p>
       "DarkSeaSkies" is "an implant that persists in the EFI firmware of an Apple MacBook Air computer" and consists of "DarkMatter", "SeaPea" and "NightSkies", respectively EFI, kernel-space and user-space implants.
      </p>
      <p>
       Documents on the "Triton" MacOSX malware, its infector "Dark Mallet" and its EFI-persistent version "DerStake" are also included in this release. While the
       <a href="https://wikileaks.org/ciav7p1/cms/page_13763820.html">
        DerStake1.4
       </a>
       manual released today dates to 2013, other Vault 7 documents show that as of 2016 the CIA continues to rely on and update these systems and is working on the production of DerStarke2.0.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also included in this release is the manual for the CIA's "NightSkies 1.2" a "beacon/loader/implant tool" for the Apple iPhone. Noteworthy is that NightSkies had reached 1.2 by 2008, and is expressly designed to be physically installed onto factory fresh iPhones. i.e the CIA has been infecting the iPhone supply chain of its targets since at least 2008.
      </p>
      <p>
       While CIA assets are sometimes used to physically infect systems in the custody of a target it is likely that many CIA physical access attacks have infected the targeted organization's supply chain including by interdicting mail orders and other shipments (opening, infecting, and resending) leaving the United States or otherwise.

       So remember the San Bernardino iPhone they couldn't get into? That was obviously MSM lying to the public for nearly a week to make the public think that their iPhones were secure right?

       I don't understand how anyone can trust anything the media says. It's propaganda. We were all tricked into thinking our government had our best interests at some point in time. Now, it's time to face facts everyone. Your government has been lying and deceiving and manipulating the world for decades.

       Do you have any info on it being a false flag? I'd be interested in reading what people have to say on it. I remember it happening and the iPhone situation, but it just kinda faded from memory after that and I never really looked into it

       Even if for some reason you want to cut the media a break, the whole thing started as a way for the government to establish court precedence on forcing any company unlocking any device they wanted so they wouldn't have to reveal the tools they have to actually do it themselves.

       Because he said he wants to fuck isis and that's a priority. Obama and Hillary just sort of let it happen and the French pm even said that the public will have to just start accepting terrorism. Trump is the only guy who said he wanted to go after isis, and knowing his relationship with he CIA and the media, his military move could be for that reason.

       Look man I'm mainly going off of how incredibly desperate the CIA and friends are to get him out of office. That, to me, produces a logical conclusion that they're not on the same team.

       Why would he stop them from doing that though? He benefits just as much from keeping people in fear of terrorism and from keeping the military and Israel happy as Obama and Bush did.

       I don't know we'll see. He seemed to make it a point during his election to
       <em>
        stop radical Islamic terrorism
       </em>
       and he doesn't have a great relationship with the CIA so it wouldn't surprise me if he would try to stop them.

       I hope so too. I'm a pessimist about the government in general, but if he makes some meaningful strides towards that goal then I'll be a happier campier. Maybe Trump can make me optimistic!

       I mean I think we can all agree that he's changed the game. Two years ago, you would've been called crazy for predicting dozens of things that are now proven. And if Hillary had gotten elected, I think we all know how close Orwell's future would have been. Now, we have a platform to start from. We have trump instead of just a bunch of conspiracy theorists. Not to say that any of us "support" him, but he has undeniably changed the game, and I think it really needed to be shaken up like it was.

       his first conference regarding vault7 was attacked, delayed, and cancelled I believe... I would expect his internet is acting a little funny while trying to stream this shit.
