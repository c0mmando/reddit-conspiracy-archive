<p>BBC reports that 12 new classifications of clouds have been added to the International Cloud Atlas, the world&#39;s premier cloud reference encyclopedia, solidifying their status as scientifically recognized atmospheric phenomena. </p>

<p>The article briefly mentions &quot;contrails&quot; with this telling quote - &quot;In the modern day you will look up to the sky and see clouds made by airplanes. Once they are made they can linger for days,&quot; said BBC meteorologist John Hammond. </p>

<p>That&#39;s a professional meteorologist saying &quot;clouds made by airplanes... linger for days.&quot; </p>

<p>People have documented that &quot;contrails&quot; don&#39;t just dissipate and that they do affect the atmosphere for extended periods of time. It is now publicly recognized in the International Cloud Atlas in its first revision since the 1980s. Atmospheric seeding has proliferated since the late 80s/ early 90s and it is now an undeniable feature of the earth&#39;s atmosphere.</p>

<p>Please let me ask these questions if you have time. </p>

<p>Are these measurable on the ground in huge concentrations?</p>

<p>If I measured my body here in Sweden would I also have abnormal concentrations of flouride in my body?</p>

<p>Are the people who are spraying and their extended families inhaling/ingesting these chemicals also?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think he was suggesting that Fluoride and Glyphosate come from your diet. Chemtrails seem to be consisting of aluminum and other chemicals, and the interesting thing is aluminum can be found on the ground near where there are typically chemtrails, but aluminum does not naturally exist in powdered form on the surface. Aluminum also notably increases the passage of fluoride to the brain.</p>

<p>This is the crux. Do you have any good link on this. Here in Sweden we monitor these. </p>

<p>If your water to your house smells funny you can send it to various testlabs and get a chemical profile back. </p>

<p>They also routinely check fish, farming soil, air quality. </p>

<p>Resarchers to spectrograms on rocks to monitor radiation or downfall.</p>

<p>I have never ever seen any report on this here in Sweden that the amount of aluminium was strangely heightened. Never for America also (but that would be the country they cover up right?)</p>

<p>It would be so easy to detect this.</p>

<p>As far as fluoride is concerned I just like to ask myself why the ADA is running paid ads in Google to set the narrative. <a href="http://www.ada.org/en/public-programs/advocating-for-the-public/fluoride-and-fluoridation">http://www.ada.org/en/public-programs/advocating-for-the-public/fluoride-and-fluoridation</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>He is referencing america.</p>

<p>Where they add fluoride to the water for &quot;dental hygiene&quot; they just recently reduced the amount of fluoride they add by quite a bit, and they are considering even reducing it even more, they still need smart people to develop technology for them. </p>

<p>As for the glyphosate, the main method of ingestion is crops are washed in the stuff and then sold to the markets, probably being sealed in by wax or not properly being cleaned. Not to mention, i imagine that plants are actually capable of absorbing the crap. So he is right, in america. I know the EU and most first world countries  have banned glysophate as being  used as a weed killer, but you know america, land of the free.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>you are joking right? Burning fuel means you produce CO2 as well as water vapour. The exhaust is really hot so that when it cools down the  vapour will turn into clouds.</p>

<p>the amount of water really isnt that much either, each gallon of fuel makes something like 7 pounds of water.</p>

<p>thats hardly atmospheric seeding. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is r/conspiracy chemtrails and contrails are always going to be mentioned side by side. </p>

<p>I&#39;m actually extremely curious how you could argue otherwise. Do you live in a NATO nation? Have you looked up in the sky more than one in the past several decades? Are you really going to argue that criss-crossing lattices of trails that turn sunny days into cloudy ones in specific areas is the result of normal air traffic. To me that&#39;s pretty unlikely.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed. My take on the article you posted is that its &quot;propaganda prepared for foreign audiences&quot;.</p>

<p>Up until NDAA &#39;12 with the amendments to the SMA it was illegal for the US gov to push propaganda on its citizens. The new legislature made it legal to spread propaganda <em>prepared for foreign audiences</em> in the US especially in the name of national security. This is why we are seeing so much US news from sites with .co.uk. (BBC, the Guardian, the Independent, etc.).</p>

<p>This is all CIA/shadow gov social engineering. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your hilarious.</p>

<p>I imagine  the people doing this are a handful of small crews for the military, told they are saving the world by doing it, so maybe you are telling the truth. But you would be risking your career by doing so.</p>

<p>People act like its impossible, but it has been known for years forming clouds could fight global warming, by blocking out most of the sun before it is able to penetrate the atmosphere. 
If it was as easy as &quot;water and fuel forming clouds&quot;, we would have seen this phenomena decades ago. but I never seen this as a kid, and I spent alot of time looking at the sky. Now all you have to do is go out there look up and watch them criss cross huge swaths of the sky (which can be seen for thousands of miles) and give it a few hours and boom suddenly the sky is completely blocked out. But most people dont notice, you know why? They are to busy looking down at their phones, especially the youngins. </p>

<p>Why do they do it? Who really knows, it could be some misguided attempt to prolong climate change, or it could be to hide something, fuck nose. </p>

<p>I do find something extremely ironic guys. Contrails are the not the same as chemtrails, if they were, they wouldnt have to classify them as a new type of cloud. God knows what is in the stuff, but it really is like ink in water. 
So for the media to say that &quot;contrails&quot; are &quot;real news&quot;, and then turn around and label &quot;chemtrails&quot; as &quot;fake news&quot;, I find it sadly ironic.</p>

<p>We truly live in the age of deception. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is a clear difference between regular &quot;contrails&quot; and &quot;persistent contrails.&quot;  The latter <em>can</em> occur naturally with sufficient humidity at altitude.  Is that kind of humidity data not collected?  It seems with minimal data, one could simply forecast persistent contrails and assess their connection to environmental factors. </p>

<p>The data would seem to show if persistent contrails tended to be natural or were something else.  If the latter, I would expect obfuscation of the data, something like cessation of collection or dissemination such that we cannot undertake simple analyses like this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If chemtrails were dumping something on you, then you could set out a device to collect samples, and then characterize those samples to determine their identity, if any at all. </p>

<p>So to conclude, </p>

<p>Step 1: design a test</p>

<p>Step 2: impliment that test</p>

<p>Step 3: Dont waste my time with talk of contrails until you do, or fund me to do it for you and I&#39;ll work the science on a device we could set up all over the place. That way we could end people fearing their own air, but then they&#39;d fear everything else until we provide a solution for that. I could foresee designing such devices, but honestly I don&#39;t mean to be a dick. I just am sick of people playing guessing games and not providing a substantial amount of evidence for their beliefs.</p>

<p>If there is a way to move forward, and confirm or deny any suspitions, then I say it&#39;s about time we do that.</p>
