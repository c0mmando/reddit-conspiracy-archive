       Inquiring minds who like to know: what are the physics behind the extremely high proportions of de-panted 'leg injuries' in these terror bombings. Private parts seem immune from injury. And pain, what's that? Here is video of a war reporter reacting to a scrapnel hit for comparison. There is substantial blood splatter.

       Can anybody find injuries elsewhere? Am not having much luck with Manchester.

       One explanation for this could be that the leg injuries are usually caused by mass evacuation, people tripping and falling over each other, people getting trampled on etc, the paramedics will cut the pants in order to see the injury and bandage it up etc. I am not saying everything is necessarily as it seems , I'm explaining how some of these things can be explained, in order for us not to jump to conclusions but to focus on the unexplained.

       I believe that's exactly the case. These pics are of people who have already been seen and treated by the paramedics who wish to treat injuries as quick as possible by either ripping or cutting parts of clothes away to get to the injury quicker.
      </p>
      <p>
       Newest updates according to BBC is that it could have been a belt attached device filled with nuts and bolts which would account for so many leg injuries. On top of that the footage of mass panic of people getting trampled etc.. not all injuries are external

       I have looked for trampling in the footage released, but it was pretty orderly, more so than one might expect actually. This one is representative.

       Most of those injuries are skinned knees. The question is why are medics treating skinned knees when there are supposed to be so many others that are dead or dying? Are they counting skinned knees among the "wounded"?

       This event needs a lot more information released for me to remove my skepticism. That many youngsters and no decent phone footage yet.

       Also worth noting Manchester has fallen victim to alleged IRA bombings previously.

       If we assume (which I do) that these are crisis actors then it makes sense that only limbs (arms and legs) can be seriously damaged. There are a number of amputees working as crisis actors. So I don't think we'll see "terror attacks" where people have parts of their faces missing or visible holes in their torso and such.

       Those people with holes in their faces and torsos are dead and not walking around waving to the camera.

       You people who claim everything to be a false flag with no evidence whatsoever absolutely sicken me. Because of people like you, families have been harassed and accused of being actors after losing loved ones.

       Yes, the wall of tears. The modus operandi in these psyops is exactly that. If there's tragic suffering and loss involved the lie works because people cannot phatom that people would lie about such grave matters.

       These are likely skinned knees from running in a panic and falling,. I'm gonna go back and check if they have their hands wrapped from where they caught themselves. ABC news is saying most people that were injured were hurt in the stampede following the explosion. Keep in mind these are drama queen teenage girls.

       More injuries happen from the stampede of people trying to escape. Its common really.
      </p>
      <p>
       Im sick off all this crap though. The UK, US and other free world countries really need to put a stop to this. Look back at history, and it would suggest this could all be finished in a few weeks. Nuclear is not nice, but it will solve the issue. Bit like Pearl Harbour. If the leaders came out and said we are dropping one nuke, per each attack, on the land that is the origin of the group responsible for said terror attack,  this 'war on terror' would  be over.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe we have give every opportunity for the countries that spawned these groups the chance to shut them down. Its gotten to the point where their bullshit has spread to those born and raised in the west. Chances are this attack will be a 'home grown terrorist', its a fucking sham.

       I'm talking about the origin of the flag these pricks are waving. Attack claimed by Isis or what ever. Then bomb the living hell out of them. This war on terror should of ended 10-15 years ago. Not gotten to a stage where they are no influencing people from the west to be home grown.

       Have you seen much footage or photos of responders, let alone casualties at the magnitude claimed? If so please post, because from what I can locate, it looks quite limited for a mass casualty event.

       If Sherlock Holmes was on the case, he would be looking at these anomalies and working backwards. He wouldn't glance at the scene and say; nothing to see here move along.

       There was a mass exodus , people are gonna trip, fall , bump into each other, get trampled on etc , just because the videos we have seen don't manage to capture that it doesn't mean it didn't happen , we are talking around 20,000 people leaving a venue at the same time in panic. Yes some will of left orderly but many will of just made a run for it , think about it, how easily you can run and trip over something, or let's say a girl in high heels in a panic trying to exit the venue, it isn't gking to be easy. There is nothing to look into regarding the leg injuries and torn jeans it's standard procedure to cut the pants at the point of the injury , because then they can bandage the injury , see if there is any visible  marks etc. They can't just tell the person to take the pants off because they need to keep them still whilst assessing the injury, wriggling about taking their pants off could make their injury worse , once they've done all this then they will either carry them put or take them off in a stretcher, it's common sense guys it happens in any incident /accident the clothes are cut at the injury.  Also to add to the mass exodus of people,onside the arena the tiered seating in the arena is very steep I've many a time been there and thought to myself how easy it would be to fall on them stairs and hurt myself. Before we call this a false flag we need something actually convincing, this stuff is just common pratice in an accident.  I know several people that went to the concert (I live close by) and they all say the same, there was a loud bang which after hearing everyone panicked and fled the venue , they were saying how frighenning it was trying to get out of the venue when everybody was trying to leave at the same time, people falling over and tripping over steps etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most peple in the arena won't of seen the actual bomb go off because the bomber set it off in the foyer after failing to reach the main arena , the foyer is a part of the building let's say an outer ring that runs around the main oval shaped arena , they have toilet, bars and merchandise for sale in the foyer. You need to go through another set off doors to get into the main arena. There would of been a few people leaving already as they tend to do 15 minutes before a concert ends to beat the traffic these would of been the unfortunate ones to get stuck amid the explosion, lack of video footage of the actual explosion would likely be to the fact that not many people would have their phones out upon leaving the venue in the foyer , any people that close to it would of been injured , killed or been trying to get away and wouldn't have time to get their phone's out, whereas the people videoing in the arena won't of realised the extent of the explosion until they got out of the main arena, and I'm assuming they encouraged people to leave via a section of foyer were the explosion didn't occur bearing in mind the foyer is huge running all way round the venue.

       The thing that the perpetrators of these attacks in the UK whether they be government or another terrorost organisation don't understand is that although we have been pacified by Nanny state laws and political correctness, we will snap. The UK has a long history of fucking shit up after we can't take anymore, they will hang people from trees, whether that be politicians or other terrorists.

       Trousers are loose fabric. An explosion can tear them off easily. It is also the first step in triage if a leg injury is suspected to remove the trousers.

       Really is it proper protocol to cut trousers, treat wounds and let people wander about for photo opportunties. Many of the Boston Marathon photos were taken immediately after the "blast", and well before any paramedics were on the scene.

       Not sure what your angle is, but the same issue was brought up with the 7/7 London bombings. A lot of the victims had their legs injured or destroyed, lending credence to the theory that the bomb in the subway was  on the floor or under the train rather than in a backpack worn by the alledged terrorist.
