    <div class="md"><p>You realize the attack happened less than 12 hours ago, it happened at 10:30 pm Britain time and they are all waking up now.</p>

<p>Why the fuck would the theatre contact their website maintenance person at 11:00 pm at night to change the website? You don&#39;t think the theatre higher ups would be asleep or at home by 10:30 on a Monday night? You don&#39;t think the theatre is dealing with bigger problems such as mass casualties on or near property. What about the theatre contacting attorneys and insurance , having meetings, planning coordinating? The fact it&#39;s less than 12 hours in should give you an idea how absurd your point of the website should of been updated immediately.</p>

<p>Jesus I wish people would actually think things through before calling a hoax. </p>

We actually have another sane human being in this sub - I&#39;m in the UK and didn&#39;t see the news of the blast until an hour ago (07:51) - I&#39;ve already seen the ignorance of the people in this sub who think they know everything about the situation when it happened less than 12 hours ago and also most being in America, linking questionable sites, concluding that they have solved it - for a conspiracy sub, people here are very closed minded.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would say people are very quick to jump the gun and an idea of a conspiracy is entertaining and fun, that&#39;s why we are all here. </p>

<p>I followed this attack from the initial stages on twitter and Reddit. The amount of disinformation and no real information coming out was incredible to me. Half the people were saying it&#39;s no big deal, a few balloons popped even though the police called it a serious incident and too stay away. About two hours in the police confirmed there was multiple fatalities and many injured. People were still claiming it was the balloons popping which caused people to get trampled in the panic.</p>

<p>I believe the police did an amazing job at responding, helping, and updating the public.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is gonna be little to no external structural damage to the building as it happened inside the venue , the layout of the venue is a main oval arena with a ring running around it , the outer ring is what they are calling the foyer. This is where it is said to of occurred an improvised explosive e.g. nail bomb would unlikely cause enough damage to be viewed externally from the venue partly due to the width and heigh of th walls and roof in th foyer. </p>
