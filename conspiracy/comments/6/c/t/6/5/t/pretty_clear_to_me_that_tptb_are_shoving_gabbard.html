<p>No, we are not shills. We Truly believe this lady is being primed for a 2020 run on behalf of the establishment. Let&#39;s do some digging.</p>

<p>IF you REALLY claim to be a conspiracy theorist, surely you are familiar with the Council on Foreign Relations?</p>

<p>It&#39;s a New World Order think tank group. People like Dick Cheney and Hillary Clinton and Obama are members on record. </p>

<p>It is believed that people among this society are often groomed and prepped for positions of influence and power within our government and finance. Here is a list of members. Any of them seem familiar? </p>

<p><a href="https://www.cfr.org/membership">https://www.cfr.org/membership</a></p>

<p>Gabbard herself is a member </p>

<p>I understand. But the Implication of her being a member of this group should set of ALL the alarms in your skeptical mind, and on this forum as a whole.</p>

<p>She needs to be watched. The CFR and her membership need to be brought to light and she needs to be questioned on it at the least, would you agree?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Obama was different, the lie he told was offering &quot;hope and change&quot; to his supporters, but even in 2008 if you looked at his website he was nowhere near anti establishment, it just said he was bipartisan and wanted to work with both Democrats and Republicans and wasn&#39;t specific on any policy at all. During that election he was propped up by a billion dollar campaign paid for primarily by the banking industry, so they owned him early on. If Gabbard starts to take that direction, taking the big money and backtracking on her message sure, she might be part of the same trick, but so far her record is nothing like Obama in any way.</p>

<p>&quot;Is a candidate/politician/etc. legitimate? The best way to find that out is to ask them if they agree with the truth tellers who were assassinated.</p>

<p>So, you should pose questions to potential leaders as such: JFK tried to issue greenbacks and Lincoln did - both were shot for it. Will you promise to issue debt and usury free currency as a president of the people right now?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;When you look at a politician, don&#39;t compare them to any other politician. Compare them to what you know is right. Only then will you avoid compromising your values and only if you avoid compromising your values will you have any chance of living in an honest world.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Are there any politicians talking about how it is easy to cut taxes to 0% across the board all while paying down the national debt, maintaining current spending, and even throwing free universal health care on top while enjoying double digit economic growth?</p>

<p>Keep in mind that is just a publicly available teaser. It&#39;s the minimum standard right now for anyone even trying to pretend to be legit. Actual legit folks can do better.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your title is factually wrong. Tulsi is a Hawaiian representative, Obama was an Illinois State senator, those are not the same state. The DNC hates Tulsi because she is anti-establishment. Just go read Pedostas emails to see what they thought of her. She has a much stronger record than Obama ever had and has supported and introduced some really good legislation.</p>

<p>It definitely seems she&#39;s qualified to run and while I do think she&#39;d be a more quality leader than we&#39;d get from anyone else in the Democratic party, I think she&#39;s still going to need to build her resume further, everyone knows being well spoken and attractive won&#39;t be enough for the American people after Obama.</p>

<p>I could see her being a strong candidate after trumps second term if she keeps introducing strong legislation and appealing to both sides rather than just the Dem base.</p>

<p>The DNC hates Tulsi because she is anti-establishment. </p>

<p>Wow, are you really that gullible? The country literally just got duped previously by another &quot;Anti-Establishment&quot; candidate in Donald Trump. </p>

<p>I find it hard to believe, that someone frequenting a &quot;conspiracy&quot; sub, has yet to put away the childish games of partisan politics. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I could see her being a strong candidate </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Right here<sup>.</sup> Really? Because most of us view these elections as nothing more than a scripted sham. These candidates you are supposedly &quot;voting for&quot;, have no actual autonomy. Are you kidding me? They have agreed to the agenda months in advance, before they even became the nominees!</p>

<p>I fear you don&#39;t understand how this system works. The US presidential candidates are merely &quot;selected&quot; by the criminal elements running the world financial scheme. Gabbard has been bred and groomed for this role. She, as a muslim woman, will be the perfect &quot;installment&quot; and facelift for their New World Order. </p>

<p>The cabal selects people very carefully. People with certain talents, charisma, charm, ethnicity, ect. Depending on what the &quot;political climate&quot; of the next election is (as they are usually able to accurately predict), they select a &quot;puppet&quot;, and start building a resume for them, as with Obama. </p>

<p>With Gabbard, they are portraying her as a humanitarian Liberal. Anti War, anti NSA spying, pro civil liberties. She will be the <em>perfect</em> candidate for a 2020 run, a breath of fresh air for voters after 4 years of Trump.  </p>

<p>Don&#39;t you ever think about things like this? Analyze these people individually and assess their social and political merits/skills? The elite do. They are always scouting for potential puppets, and they have most certainly found one in Gabbard.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I do think she&#39;d be a more quality leader than we&#39;d get from anyone else in the Democratic party</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Bottom line is, if you are still investing this much faith and taking the political system and electory process &quot;seriously&quot;, then we are on two different plains. Consider the possibility that these politicians are more than simply actual people providing a service and living out their lives. They are organized criminals, actors, playing a role. This isn&#39;t a game, people do not get attention like Gabbard if they are not playing by the rules. </p>

<p>Bottom line, </p>
