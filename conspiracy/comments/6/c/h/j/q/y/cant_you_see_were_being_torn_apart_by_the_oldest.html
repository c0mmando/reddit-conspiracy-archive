<p>Why do you think BLM</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you want to come together, the first thing you need to do is support -- or at least not ridicule and oppose -- good causes.</p>

<p>The main purpose of BLM is to stop THE STATE FROM KILLING PEOPLE. While the movement is led by black people, it is one that would benefit us all.</p>

<p>Those who understand that reform to reduce police killing of black people is reform that benefits all people (as black people aren&#39;t the only ones being killed) will bring us together. Those who oppose BLM are the problem. We should all know this because it is very basic. :)</p>

<p>No, you don&#39;t. You prefer a police state over BLM. That&#39;s what the &quot;but&quot; means in your sentence. It&#39;s called <em>deflection</em> (or trolling) and it indicates <em>divisiveness and conquering</em> -- which you claim to oppose.</p>

<p>Are you kidding me? You&#39;re using ad hominem to put words in my mouth. Since when does addressing black on black violence insinuate I support a police state? That makes absolutely zero sense. Police on black crimes ARE a prominent issue, but according to factual evidence a more important issue, which is seemingly less addressed is black on black homocides. Those are the facts.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dude saying black on black crime is a bigger issue than white police on black crime is like going to an AIDS benefit and saying YEAH BUT WHAT ABOUT BREAST CANCER THOUGH. Why don&#39;t I ever hear the people who bring up black on black crime ever talk about the epidemic of white on white crime? Is it because it only matters when trying to discredit a movement? </p>

<p>OP I like your main post, you&#39;re coming from the right place, that of love and respect. But if we are going to tear down the divisions society keeps enforcing on us, we need to acknowledge the problems different groups of people have. BLM is used by the Democrats to divide and conquer, but the group itself is filled with real grassroots activists who are doing a lot to help their communities. It always bugs me when other anti-establishment people speak poorly of BLM, because hating BLM is what the establishment wants. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What does black on black crime have to do with police crime? Black on black crime is a result of social circumstances, and has little to do with skin color. If the poorest people in the country were white and were generally concentrated in areas consisting mainly of poor whites, then we&#39;d have a problem with white on white crime instead.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a socioeconomic issue arising from centuries of oppression and injustice perpetrated against blacks by whites, and the entrenched attitude of a society that until recently counted racism as one of it&#39;s core tenets.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a lot of black on black crime because there are a lot of poor black people. There are a lot of poor black people because wealth tends to be passed from generation to generation, staying within families or at least communities.</p>

<p>So you should really call it poor on poor crime, not black on black crime, because it has little to do with skin color. And think about that for a second, how could skin color factor into this? If you believe &quot;black on black&quot; crime is a problem, then how do you suppose the &quot;black&quot; part factors into it?</p>

<p>That being said, police crime is a much bigger problem, because it&#39;s crime being perpetrated by the very people who are charged with protecting citizens from crime and upholding the law. Police crime is perhaps the very worst kind of crime.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You don&#39;t sound racist. Those are facts.</p>

<p>But BLM has no direction. To correct what they seek to correct, we need to look at root causes of some of the major issues while concurrently making specific demands.</p>

<p>BLM should have one demand: hold officers responsible for killing civilians in unwarranted situations. How do we do this? Demand an independent external oversight agency. No more internal investigations, no more police protecting police. That is step 1.</p>

<p>Now the root. Why is the black community having internal issues with violence and crime? There are a. unch of roots, but one major one is the war on drugs, breaking up families, putting fathers in jail for stupid reasons. Correct that and we&#39;re on the right track. And de-privatize prisons. That&#39;s essential.</p>

<p>Education is next. And community. And correcting perceptions of rap culture and gang glorification. Hyper-masculinity and violence. People like 50 Cent are not role models. Ben Carson, politics aside, is a role model. I don&#39;t know how you fix these things, but if we stop putting so many non-violent fathers in jail, I think that role models will become fathers rather than media figures and gangs won&#39;t be so attractive (with a full house)</p>

<p>Maybe then issues of police-on-black (or anyone) violence could be cut back. Black-on-black and black-on-white violence could be reduced. And internal racism would in turn be reduced. Prejudices won&#39;t be fixed until these other things are fixed. I believe it&#39;s mostly born out of fear, and it&#39;s not something you can just turn off when one realizes the state of most urban black communities.</p>
