        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I am calling bullshit on the reporting on this &quot;attack&quot; by CNN. The first reports that I heard were that there were TWO explosions. Now, CNN has shifted the narrative to just ONE terrorist explosion. They also have had experts on now who are saying &quot;suicide bomber&quot; and the expert just threw out that when a terrorist cell like &quot;SYRIANS&quot; train folks they use a specific bomb. Same &quot;expert&quot; also says that no one who witnessed the attack was to be believed since the story will &quot;change&quot; and &quot;false memories&quot; will take over. </p>

<p>SO much of this sounds familiar, two explosions becomes one. Experts say that it is a terrorist attack and actually mention WHO could have been responsible (in this case Syria).</p>

<p>They also have had people who were NOT EVEN in the building stating that they heard only ONE explosion. This is crazy. Something smells rotten on this coverage.</p>

<p>CNN continues to stream the same looped videos with the screams heard in the background. Kind of encourages TERROR huh?</p>

<p>Narrative continues, on CNN &quot;Who trained them, who radicalized them, who did what?&quot;</p>

<p>I don&#39;t Trust the mainstream media&#39;s reporting on this, do YOU?</p>

<p>Maybe you arent familiar with how narcissistic a modern teenage girl can be...idk...maybe tonight was the exception        </p>

<p>....but still to have 0 footage of it? and more people not turning their phones back on after they hear an explosion? No compelling evidence so far imo. And the lack of images, both still and video, in this day and age is highly suspect.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly. With as much bullshit TPTB have been caught pulling, I find it laughable that people on r/conspiracy of all places is just taking their word for it that the explosion even happened. Too many people are afraid of being thought of as a heartless dick who questions the death of people. Well I&#39;m sorry, but its far too late in the game to just believe everything that I hear and read from the mainstream media/government....I can handle being thought of as heartless dick...better than being thought of as a naive lemming imo...</p>
