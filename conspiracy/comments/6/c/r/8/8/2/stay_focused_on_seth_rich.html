<p>LOL. All this hamstering over a used up post wall hag who cheated on you.
All these sentences and paragraphs devoted on hamstering trying to rationalize a reason why you should stay with a used up post wall hag 13 years older than you.
You are so pathetic, with so few options, that this used up post wall hag represents 100% of your access to pussy, so of course you will let anything slide just to maintain hope of accessing it.
You are pathetic. I bet you haven&#39;t even read any red pill material, you are just here thinking its another run of the mill relationship advice sub.</p>

You sound like a lazy fat ass who is too lazy to lift and thinks you will get ahead instead by saying lifting is stupid.
Good luck with that, fatty.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah evoke the WaPo boogie man when in reality this was a Fox 5, right wing distraction. Essentially claim the PI made has been retracted.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>WASHINGTON - EDITOR&#39;S NOTE (5/17/17): We want to update you on a story you first saw on FOX 5 DC. We want to make an important clarification on claims that were made by Rod Wheeler, the private investigator hired by Seth Rich&#39;s family, whose services are being paid for by a third party.</p>

<p>What he told FOX 5 DC on camera Monday regarding Seth Rich&#39;s murder investigation is in clear contrast to what he has said over the last 48 hours. Rod Wheeler has since backtracked.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>Wheeler told CNN he had no evidence to suggest Rich had contacted Wikileaks before his death.</p>

<p>&quot;[A] current FBI official and a former one completely discount the Fox News claim that an FBI analysis of a computer belonging to Rich contained thousands of e-mails to and from WikiLeaks,&quot; the report read. &quot;Local police in Washington, D.C., never even gave the FBI Rich&#39;s laptop to analyze after his murder.&quot;</p>

<p>Simply put, in regards to Rich&#39;s laptop, &quot;It never contained any e-mails related to WikiLeaks, and the FBI never had it,&quot; a former law enforcement official with direct knowledge of the case said.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It hasn&#39;t. We don&#39;t know exactly who murdered Seth Rich, but many different sources have corroborated claims of Rich being a Wikileaks source. Because of his being identified as a Wikileaks source, it&#39;s reasonable to suspect that he may have been assassinated, particularly by someone within the DNC or Clinton campaign, the groups who were most negatively impacted by Wikileaks good journalism last year. </p>

<p>There&#39;s nothing &quot;debunked&quot; about anything though. The private investigator contracted by the family has been heavily smeared by the corporate media, but even if smearing a guy proved that everything he ever said was a lie, that doesn&#39;t eliminate all of the other corroborating claims. Multiple people who are closely involved with Wikileaks have directly stated that Rich was a source and Julian Assange and the Wikileaks twitter accounts both shared news reports asserting that Rich is a Wikileaks source. Considering Wikileaks strict adherence to their policy to never reveal their sources, even if they&#39;ve been effectively revealed publicly as with Chelsea Manning, their sharing news articles of that nature is as close to a confirmation from Wikileaks as we&#39;re ever going to get. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Harvey Schlangen pointed out that when Trump had his monumental meeting with China&#39;s President Xi, the Deep State didn&#39;t want the American people to know about the massive ramifications of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank and the New Silk Road (and how that will collapse the Anglo-American banking grid), so right on cue: A false flag in Syria to eat up the media cycle.</p>

<p>Suddenly, Trump and Xi were a footnote in the news and the fake atrocity in Syria was eating up all the oxygen in the room.</p>

<p>We&#39;ve watched a similar phenomenon with Seth Rich. Every time a new disclosure comes out there&#39;s a fake story in the media to mask over it. When it emerged that Seth&#39;s computer did indeed send 44,000 emails to Wikileaks, the news cycle was taken up with Democrats calling for Trump&#39;s impeachment.</p>

<p>Then (like magic) two days later, the Dems dropped all talk of impeachment. They did it just long enough to fill the 24-hour news channels.</p>

<p>Now as Kim.Com is going on Hannity to confirm that Seth Rich was indeed the leaker, right on cue: The Ariana Grande terror attack.</p>

<p>Watch for one of these each time we get closer to the Seth Rich story and to the implosion of the fake Russian Hacking narrative.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not &quot;liberals&quot;. Deep State.</p>

<p>Get &quot;liberal&quot; out of your mind. (It&#39;s irrelevant to the conservation.)</p>

<p>What we&#39;re talking about is the Deep State, which does indeed have the power to carry out penny-ante false0flag terror attacks at the drop of a hat to distract the media news cycle.</p>

<p>Was Obama, as part of the Deep State, spying on a political opponent, and did he fabricate a pretext to give it the veneer of legality (when in fact what he did was quite illegal)?</p>

<p>I ask you one question: Why was the FISA court invented in 1978?</p>

<p>Answer: It was founded in the wake of Nixonian spying on political opponents.</p>

<p>Spying on political opponents and using the state apparatus to do it <em>is</em> illegal.</p>

<p>The facts we know (and these <em>are</em> facts): Obama tried to cobble together up a pretext to spy on Trump so he took the now-debunked British dossier about Russian prostitutes urinating on Trump to the FISA court to claim that he <em>could</em> be blackmailed. The FISA court took two seconds examining the quality of the dossier, (correctly) rejected it as garbage and then turned out Obama&#39;s request to surveil Trump. It was only the 12th time in the FISA court&#39;s history that it turned down a request to spy. Why? Because it was a blatant attempt by Obama to spy on a political opponent and use it as opposition research to pass onto the DNC.</p>

<p>Fact #2: Obama, rejected by the FISA court, and with no lawful avenue to spy on Trump, went to British Intelligence and had <em>them</em> wiretap Trump Tower and pass the intelligence back to Obama under the cover of &quot;information sharing&quot; between state agencies. </p>

<p>Fact #3: Susan Rice committed a felony by unmasking a US citizen and leaking it to the press. That&#39;s not a lapse of judgment; it&#39;s literally illegal.</p>

<p>If your premise is that everything they did was run of the mill, above-board day-to-day operation, why did they go to such great lengths to hide it?</p>

<p>People don&#39;t bend over backwards to hide what is legal.</p>

<p>Susan Rice will almost certainly be implicated in Seth Rich&#39;s murder, too. Since Rich was also unmasked, and his information leaked to the people who assassinated him.</p>

<p>The DNC would have had no idea who stuck a flash drive into their database and passed it on to Wikileaks. Only Wikileaks was being surveilled. Meaning: When the NSA was tapping Wikileaks&#39; website, they were also getting raw data on who various whistleblowers are. According to now-obtained Freedom of Information Act documents we know for a fact that Seth Rich was swept up in the Wikileaks surveillance, and we know that in the original documents his name was redacted.</p>

<p>Someone his name got un-redacted.</p>

<p>And somehow the person the unmasked him leaked the info to the DNC.</p>

<p>Murder is illegal, dude.</p>

<p>Susan Rice is one of about 6 people who could have unmasked Seth Rich.</p>

<p>This is about more than saying Bye-Bye to the made-up Russian Collusion conspiracy theory. This is about a political assassination . . . and it leads right the fuck back to Susan Rice and Obama.</p>

<p>They screwed up by changing the protocols. </p>

<p>Had they left the original National Security protocols in place, they could have had plausible deniability. &quot;Any one of thousands of people could have had access,&quot; they could have argued.</p>

<p>But by changing the protocols at the last minute of his administration, and only giving 6 people authority to unmask people at will, the suspect pool just got <em>real</em> small.</p>

<p>That&#39;s how Obama fucked up, and that&#39;s why these people are panicking now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was using &quot;Liberals&quot; to essentially mean Deep State.</p>

<p>Fact #1: While the dossier was hearsay, your timeline doesn&#39;t match: the FISA warrant was rejected in June, while the government didn&#39;t have the dossier until December. </p>

<p>Fact #2: You&#39;re gonna have to prove that because I&#39;ve never heard anything like that before.</p>

<p>Fact #3: Prove Susan Rice <em>herself</em> leaked that information to the press. Because from what I remember, no one knew anything about the unmasking until Nunes rushed to the White House. Wow, the Deep State really has pawns everywhere.</p>

<p>Show me this information that definitively connects Rich to WikiLeaks. I thought I was up-to-date on my Seth Rich. If WikiLeaks had a trove of DNC emails, why <em>wouldn&#39;t</em> a fairly significant employee pop up? And wouldn&#39;t WikiLeaks be just as capable of unmasking his name or is there something I&#39;m missing?</p>

<p>I&#39;m confused as to how changing the protocols at the last minute prevents the possibility that anyone could have unmasked someone in the past. Rich would have had to have been unmasked at least ten months ago.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe you can share a link to this Haberman article? Because all I can find are reports that Eli Lake told us Susan Rice was responsible for the unmasking, and that Mike Cernovich claims Haberman was sitting on the story. But neither of them work for the New York Times or are named Maggie Haberman, huh? </p>

<p>When I try to convince someone I&#39;m right, I always use discredited reports too. How did he just so happen to know the number of emails? Because he has the Internet. Because he can go to WikiLeaks and look up the number of emails he needs to find. Sorry, that&#39;s wrong: so he knows the number that an anonymous &quot;federal investigator&quot; needs to find.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll admit that I can&#39;t explain the computer, but do you realize that no one has ever confirmed Rich was the leaker? That Assange has repeatedly refused to directly confirm to the world that Rich was the leaker? So he&#39;ll go so far as to strongly suggest that Rich was the leaker, but won&#39;t actually confirm his suggestion for anyone. Because WikiLeaks never ever reveals their sources, they only stop just short so they can still claim deniablity later. Cool.</p>

<p>How did he know who Rich was? Because the narrative about his murder had already begun. Look at the comments for that video; every one of them is saying the same things as people are saying now.</p>

<p>And, as I said in the other comment, it&#39;s fucked up that he did. That doesn&#39;t mean Trump is sucking Putin&#39;s dick though. It&#39;s far more likely that <em>Flynn</em> has skeletons in his closet that he doesn&#39;t want out. He should face the music he made for himself, but most don&#39;t. </p>

<p>And also, as I said in the other comment, I wish this many people cared about others invoking the fifth last year, or the year before, or all the other investigations under Bush and Obama that were stonewalled by pleading the fifth. </p>

<p>It&#39;s great you all care now, but the country would likely look far different (and Trump likely wouldn&#39;t be president) if this many cared back then. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The DNC never allowed the FBI or any other agency inspect their servers. Instead they paid cyber firm Crowdstrike to find evidence of Russian hacking.  Recently, Crowdstrike claimed to have found evidence of Russia hacking into Ukrainian artillery - until the Ukrainian military disputed the findings and they had to withdraw the report. This was reported on the Voice of America which is remarkable in itself.  It is remarkable that a story with direct relevance to the DNC story, never appeared in the US mainstream media.  Perhaps when Comey testifies, someone may ask why the FBI, sight unseen, accepted, now tainted, second hand evidence from a company working for the DNC, in such a matter of national security? <a href="http://www.voanews.com/a/cyber-firm-rewrites-part-disputed-russian-hacking-report/3781411.html">http://www.voanews.com/a/cyber-firm-rewrites-part-disputed-russian-hacking-report/3781411.html</a> </p>

<p>Now we have a insider&#39;s account in the book &quot;Shattered&quot; by Jonathan Allen and Amie Parnes, that says quite a bit about &quot;Russian Hacking&quot;.</p>

<p>&quot;That strategy had been set within twenty-four hours of her concession speech. Mook and Podesta assembled her communications team at the Brooklyn headquarters to engineer the case that the election wasn’t entirely on the up-and-up. For a couple of hours, with Shake Shack containers littering the room, they went over the script they would pitch to the press and the public. Already, Russian hacking was the centerpiece of the argument.&quot;</p>

<p>We have dubious, technical data from a company hired by the DNC.  There is no explanation as to why US agencies would count the circumstantial cyber evidence ahead of witnesses to the contrary, and the material written by DNC insiders, appears to contradict the DNC narrative.   Im not a lawyer, but why is such dubious evidence accepted over the first person accounts of Assange and Murray?</p>

<p>Hey, this is the only real point you have.  But it&#39;s rather understandable that a random murder would have very little evidence to go by.  You know, I do think it was an assassination.  I think you&#39;re just pinning it on the wrong people who don&#39;t have a motive (why kill seth when the leaks are a done deal according to Assange??) or opportunity (how would they know that seth had the information and leaked it???).  The people with motive (cover up the tracks) or opportunity (knowing that Seth is the insider) were either the ones he was leaking to, or his accomplices.  This is basic criminology.</p>

<p>The fact is that the Ukrainian government did not want to sound weak to Russia, whom they were engaged in protracted military conflict with.  So of course they say their howitzers were not taken offline by malware.  Crowdstrike made an estimate about the effectiveness of the cyberwarfare and then corrected their numbers when more information came through, that&#39;s just being diligent.  They were never &quot;busted&quot; nor &quot;retracted&quot; anything and their credibility is only harmed in eyes of people like you who don&#39;t want to believe plain reality.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Newsweek has learned that the FBI is not involved in the Rich case, despite the claims that it is. And speaking with Newsweek, Wheeler, the private investigator, seemed to walk back his comments. ... In a message to Newsweek on Tuesday, Wheeler said the Fox News report was misleading and that his information was secondhand from that “federal investigator.” “I’ve never, ever seen Seth Rich’s computer, nor have I talked with the federal investigator,” ... But on Wednesday, Wheeler tells Newsweek he is not surprised to hear that the FBI is not involved in the case, and he says the Washington police department had told him the same thing. “I’ve been told that a couple of times, that they’re not involved,” he says. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>What the fuck is going-on with this idiot?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Wheeler, the private investigator, is working with the family. Ed Butowsky, a financial adviser who has written for Breitbart News, says he connected the family with Wheeler.</p>

<p>Oh, that&#39;s not suspicious at all. </p>

<p>There is an investigation, but the FBI is not, and has never been, involved. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>While the FBI is not investigating the case, an investigation by Washington’s Metropolitan Police Department remains active, according to the department. “We continue to work with the family to bring closure to this case, as we do with all homicide investigations,” a police spokesperson said in a statement. The department is offering a reward of up to $25,000 for information leading to an arrest and conviction. Asked about the claims made in the Fox News report, a spokesperson for the department says by email, “MPD does not entertain conspiracy theories.”</p>

<p>Yes. The case is extremely strong. The general consensus in the cybersecurity community is that Guccifer was a GRU false flag - some of the emails he/she/it released were altered and had Cyrillic characters in the metadata, suggesting the use of a Russian-language keyboard. </p>

<p>Legit source you&#39;ve got there - a writer for <del>Soviet</del> Russian state-run media. No conflict of interest there, eh?</p>

<p>In my own conversations with Guccifer, after I asked to interview him, he informed me that he did not like one outlet I was writing for, Sputnik News, because it was Russian.</p>

<p>Funny how y&#39;all will disregard anything coming from multiple neutral cybersecurity firms, and take the word of Russian government shills instead..?</p>

<p>The case there  against G2.0 being a Russian disinformation campaign is basically: &#39;it was too sloppy, too good to be true, therefore it must have been Hillary&#39;s campaign&#39;. It&#39;s a shitty argument, with no actual evidence - just innuendo. It&#39;s summed-up in one fact-free paragraph:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The campaign was in a desperate position and really needed something similar to a Russian hacker narrative and one where they would be fortunate to have a seemingly clumsy hacker that leaves lots of &#39;fingerprints&#39; tainting files and bringing the reputation of leaks iinto question... Sure enough, 2-3 days later, Guccifer2.0 - the world&#39;s weirdest hacker - was spawned and started telling lies in an effort to attribute himself to the malware discoveries, etc.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Suuuure, what about the fact that 2.0 was &#39;spawned&#39; (apt turn of phrase) on the <em>same fucking day</em> that Crowdstrike fingered Cozy and Fancy Bear, both of whom long thought to be tools of the FSB and GRU in the tech community?</p>

<p>No it doesn&#39;t. It&#39;s effectively impossible to find any genuine dissent about this in the tech community outside of fringe bloggers with dubious credibility. But you know, if &#39;Moon of Alabama&#39; (the source of your &#39;LibertyBlitzkrieg&#39; - a not at all dubious titling...) says it it must be true.</p>

<p>Funny how I can&#39;t actually find any actual mention from the IISS website/journal about how Crowdstrike &quot;erroneously used IISS data&quot;?</p>

<p>Nothing is ever entirely conclusive in this murky world of cyber-espionage. To use that general fact to discredit a strong inference to the best explanation, and then turn-around and promote  a theory about Rich based on entirely superficial circular logic is an absurdity. &#39;Rich was killed, therefore he must be the leaker&#39;; &#39;he was the leaker, therefore he must have been killed for it&#39;.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a fake fucking story that has been utterly obliterated no sooner than it had started, but people wont let it go.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>VOA first contacted IISS in February to verify the alleged artillery losses. Officials there initially were unaware of the CrowdStrike assertions. After investigating, they determined that CrowdStrike misinterpreted their data and hadn’t reached out beforehand for comment or clarification.</p>

<p>In a statement to VOA, the institute flatly rejected the assertion of artillery combat losses.</p>

<p>And from <a href="https://medium.com/@jeffreycarr/the-gru-ukraine-artillery-hack-that-may-never-have-happened-820960bbb02d">this</a> source:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Not only did Crowdstrike choose to quote improbably high losses estimated by a Pro-Russia analyst, we know have confirmation from Ukraine’s MOD that (1) those figures were wrong, (2) Crowdstrike’s reason for the losses were wrong, and (3) Crowdstrike’s spread of false information caused harm.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Reasonable if you want to be a tool of the right-wing media. Reasonable if you want to promote a story with no new evidence in the past few weeks. Reasonable if you want to be a scumbag and go agaist the wishes of the family.</p>

<p>I do think there&#39;s some smoke here. But as they say, &quot;Fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice, shame on me.&quot; And Fox5 fooled me once claiming to have seen the fire when they had nothing but an old story and a partisan phony willing to lie about seeing the fire. </p>

<p>For people that doubt the claims in the video, here is a look at people behind the Fox5 story:</p>

<p><strong>Rod Wheeler</strong> - Famous for <a href="https://twitter.com/rodwheeler/status/855391951012737025">his neutrality</a> and <a href="https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/intelligence-report/2007/rod-wheeler-claims-o%E2%80%99reilly-factor-lesbian-gangs-are-raping-young-girls">lesbian gangs who rape your teenage daughters.</a></p>

<p><strong>Ed Butowsky</strong> the <a href="http://www.edbutowsky.com/">selfless financier of this &quot;conspiracy&quot;</a></p>

<p>There is literally no new information here or in any post in the past few weeks. It&#39;s nothing more that a right-wing distraction that this sub has been used to promote. </p>

<p>I want to seek the truth, but you keep using claims from a source who is nothing more than a paid actor, you are not a free thinker. You are a right-wing propaganda tool.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, Fact be damned. Let&#39;s push the latest right-wing narrative to distract the sub from Trump selling arms to Saudi Arabia. </p>

<p>As they say, &quot;Fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice, shame on me.&quot; And Fox5 fooled me once claiming to have seen the fire when they had nothing but an old story and a partisan phony willing to lie about seeing the fire. </p>

<p>For people that doubt the claims in the video, here is a look at people behind the Fox5 story:</p>

<p><strong>Rod Wheeler</strong> - Famous for <a href="https://twitter.com/rodwheeler/status/855391951012737025">his neutrality</a> and <a href="https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/intelligence-report/2007/rod-wheeler-claims-o%E2%80%99reilly-factor-lesbian-gangs-are-raping-young-girls">lesbian gangs who rape your teenage daughters.</a></p>

<p><strong>Ed Butowsky</strong> the <a href="http://www.edbutowsky.com/">selfless financier of this &quot;conspiracy&quot;</a></p>

<p>There is literally no new information here or in any post in the past few weeks. It&#39;s nothing more that a right-wing distraction that this sub has been used to promote. </p>

<p>I want to seek the truth, but you keep using claims from a source who is nothing more than a paid actor, you are not a free thinker. You are a right-wing propaganda tool.</p>

<p>Oh, so lets instead push the Fox 5 story where all the <a href="http://www.fox5dc.com/news/local-news/254852337-story">key claims the PI made have been retracted.</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>WASHINGTON - EDITOR&#39;S NOTE (5/17/17): We want to update you on a story you first saw on FOX 5 DC. We want to make an important clarification on claims that were made by Rod Wheeler, the private investigator hired by Seth Rich&#39;s family, whose services are being paid for by a third party.</p>

<p>What he told FOX 5 DC on camera Monday regarding Seth Rich&#39;s murder investigation is in clear contrast to what he has said over the last 48 hours. Rod Wheeler has since backtracked.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And there&#39;s this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Wheeler told CNN he had no evidence to suggest Rich had contacted Wikileaks before his death.</p>

<p>&quot;[A] current FBI official and a former one completely discount the Fox News claim that an FBI analysis of a computer belonging to Rich contained thousands of e-mails to and from WikiLeaks,&quot; the report read. &quot;Local police in Washington, D.C., never even gave the FBI Rich&#39;s laptop to analyze after his murder.&quot;</p>

<p>Simply put, in regards to Rich&#39;s laptop, &quot;It never contained any e-mails related to WikiLeaks, and the FBI never had it,&quot; <a href="http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/hold-fire-on-those-stories-about-seth-rich-the-slain-dnc-staffer/article/2623263">a former law enforcement official with direct knowledge of the case said.</a></p>

Open your mind a little bit, I&#39;m seeing a lot of bullshit from all sides and I don&#39;t know who killed Seth Rich, but considering there are 2-3 hours of that night between the last phone call and his death when he was close to his house that nobody can explain, there&#39;s security camera footage of the murder that nobody, not even the parents, are allowed to see, and there is his missing laptop, which, if this was just a robbery, should have never entered police evidence in the first place. I&#39;m not saying there&#39;s any evidence to prove he was murdered by the government, but the fact is the whole thing is very fishy and nobody knows who killed him. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Party said that Oceania had never been in alliance with Eurasia. He, Winston Smith, knew that Oceania had been in alliance with Eurasia as short a time as four years ago. But where did that knowledge exist? Only in his own consciousness, which in any case must soon be annihilated...Even though Winston has evidence of the Party’s lies in his memory, he also accepts that the unreliability of his mind will soon expunge that evidence as well.</p>
