       There is no evidence of a connection, but you're just going to leap out there and toss a dead man's name around to make your theory gain weight?

       hmmmm. I made a simple post with the intent to get others to think about something. It has apparently worked. I feel good about that. I have obviously accomplished my mission here. I really like this sub. There are a variety of different viewpoints to be found and the discussions are usually always good.

       Perhaps try to put more time into contributing to a discussion than attempting to decry or derail it instead. Either way have a nice evening.

       It is the mark of an intelligent mind to entertain a thought without believing it. A mark that you will never show.

      <p>
       By starting dialogue surrounding our suspicions, suspicions that are entirely grounded and warranted, we are able to bring to light many things. We do this regularly, while you continuously try to derail it (we see your comment history). Have you not yet learned the name of the subreddit that you are participating in?

       Apparently you haven't done a very good job reading my comment history. I would say it's not entirely your fault considering not all my beliefs are spelled out clearly there but only someone particularly deluded would thing they know a person based solely on their comment history so really it is your fault.

       I'm hoping to find that there are other people who feel as I do that this is an outrageous thing to say and does a disservice to Seth Rich and the victims of today's attack.

       Pretty sure it's not the anti-logic and reasoning sub. Just because you entertain conspiracy theories does not mean you should assume everything is a conspiracy.

       There is no connection that can be shown between this and Seth Rich, therefor it makes zero sense to assume it has anything to do with him.

       When did "conspiracy" start meaning "everyone on this sub has to believe every shitty thing anyone says at all times without question or you're a shill"? That's basically the OPPOSITE of what should be discussed on a conspiracy sub.

       it doesn't even make sense that a place with known terrorist attacks would let a massive event go on without security checking people, which there are reports from concert goers that they were not checked at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why?
      </p>
      <p>
       was security told to stand down so an explosive could be worked into the concert? I mean who seriously brings an explosive device to someone's concert and doesn't try and use it when the star is on stage but wait till after the concert and after the entertainer has left...
      </p>
      <p>
       Seems.. orchestrated.

       the explosion took place near the exit, so not a concert-goer and the person could probably get close enough without having to enter and get checked. Strategically, a killer would wait till the concert ends because that's when all the parents are waiting right outside, and the people inside are trying to leave- so it's the chance for the most chaos possible

       you are looking to narrowly. The truth is not found by pursuing one lead at a time. Sometimes one must travel down multiple avenues of thought at the same time to reach a conclusion. Tunnel vision kills. THAT is my point. Do not drop one thing and run to the next like a dog being thrown a second tennis ball before bringing it back to the thrower.

       If this is to distract from Seth Rich, don't you think they would have done it here instead? Why would they bomb elsewhere for a false flag.

       Did you ever think maybe it is in conjunction with Trump's terror speech last night and it is going to be used to further push the wall/safety line? Probably not, because your bias is all over the place.

       No, I just think that such a level of wild speculation across continents for your domestic politics is ridiculous.

       In the world of globalization we should not constrict our thoughts or ideas to the shores of our nations. Anyone hanging around here long enough has seen enough proven conspiracies to inform us undeniably that we need to be more vigilant than that.

       The conclusion they have reached to themselves is purely up to them. I have little to no control over that. I have no control over whether you are so offended by my post. Nor do I put alot of thought into that. It is really not my problem . I have enough of my own to be so worried about yours. Sometimes inspiring free thought is the most important thing.

       I think anyone with an ear to the ground should be suspicious of events so close together.

       You'll consider that an Airana Grande concert was bombed to cover up the Seth Rich story, but I get harangued for saying that the Seth Rich story artificially blew up overnight because conservatives wanted to take the heat off Trump.

       you are looking to narrowly. The truth is not found by pursuing one lead at a time. Sometimes one must travel down multiple avenues of thought at the same time to reach a conclusion. Tunnel vision kills. THAT is my point. Do not drop one thing and run to the next like a dog being thrown a second tennis ball before bringing it back to the thrower.

       hmmmm. I made a simple post with the intent to get others to think about something. It has apparently worked. I feel good about that. I have obviously accomplished my mission here. I really like this sub. There are a variety of different viewpoints to be found and the discussions are usually always good.
      </p>
      <p>
       Perhaps try to put more time into contributing to a discussion than attempting to decry or derail it instead. Either way have a nice evening.

       I'm done with the petty bickering. I'm not here to attack you.

       I'm here to state the obvious and hopefully remind people that even though some people are going to immediately shout out the most insane distasteful things they can think of the moment something eventful happens, there are still some of us here who are ready to have an informed discourse.
