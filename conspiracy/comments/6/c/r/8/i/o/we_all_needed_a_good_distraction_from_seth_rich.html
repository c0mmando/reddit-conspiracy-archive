<p>was security told to stand down so an explosive could be worked into the concert? I mean who seriously brings an explosive device to someone&#39;s concert and doesn&#39;t try and use it when the star is on stage but wait till after the concert and after the entertainer has left... </p>

    <div class="md"><p>the explosion took place near the exit, so not a concert-goer and the person could probably get close enough without having to enter and get checked.

<p>&quot;Eh, just fake news trying to distract me from my unproven claims Seth Rich was the criminal leaker and the DNC learned about it in real time and called a hit on his life. Wow, democrats in the U.K committing terror attacks, I sure want civil war even more now.&quot;</p>

<p>Did you ever think maybe it is in conjunction with Trump&#39;s terror speech last night and it is going to be used to further push the wall/safety line? Probably not, because your bias is all over the place. </p>

<p>I currently have 306 views with a 50% upvote rating on this post. That means I have at least inspired 150+ people (really all who have read the post) to form an opinion on this subject.</p>

<p>The conclusion they have reached to themselves is purely up to them. I have little to no control over that. I have no control over whether you are so offended by my post. Nor do I put alot of thought into that. It is really not my problem . I have enough of my own to be so worried about yours. Sometimes inspiring free thought is the most important thing.</p>

<p>I think anyone with an ear to the ground should be suspicious of events so close together. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>you are looking to narrowly. The truth is not found by pursuing one lead at a time. Sometimes one must travel down multiple avenues of thought at the same time to reach a conclusion. Tunnel vision kills. THAT is my point.

    <div class="md"><p>hmmmm. I made a simple post with the intent to get others to think about something. It has apparently worked. I feel good about that. I have obviously accomplished my mission here. I really like this sub. There are a variety of different viewpoints to be found and the discussions are usually always good. </p>

<p>Perhaps try to put more time into contributing to a discussion than attempting to decry or derail it instead. Either way have a nice evening.</p>
