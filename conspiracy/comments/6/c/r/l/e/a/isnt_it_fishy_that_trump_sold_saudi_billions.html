    <div class="md"><p>I approve. </p>

<p>Oh no, hillary is doing it -&gt; shut up you, this is all in good faith, we would never have to investigate the clintons....</p>

<p>Oh, Ivanka fund raises for a world bank fund for women? -&gt; OMG, the same thing hillary did. </p>

<p>If you read the article, Ivanka is as associated with the fund as Paris hilton is with making perfume. Does she do it? yep. has she access to or is she able to controll where the funds go? Nope. Thgus, all ivanka does is justify why she gets to fly on daddys private jet. </p>

<p>The fairest response would be to deliver exactly the same public outcry and retort as to hillaries fundation making millions: </p>

<p>None. </p>

<p>Maybe then certain people and professional outrage peddlers learn that if you try to errect a double standart, it bites you in the ass. Untill the same people cry to throw hillary on the electric chair untill she gives us the full books of the clinton foundation, and what the money was used for (Or, you know, demand any investiagtion at all):</p>

<p>Ivanka is an airheaded young woman, who may have attached some fundraising to get free trips, but she has outraised Clinton threefold. </p>

<p>If you are pissed that a young woman is an airhead yet managed to outraise your hope for president, here is the door, here is the safespace, here is a blanket to cover your fee fees. </p>

<p>Maybe the next time a democratic candidate has a nonprofit, you learn to apply the same rules there. </p>

<p>In the meantime: </p>

<p>Ivanka, you may be an airhead, but you outraised Hillary clinton threefold. That is like playing the same on super hard mode, and crushing the highscore. An archievement on its own. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>But, is it true? </p>

<p>Not a single crime has been committed, She has outraised Clinton on the same turf 1:3, and she did it not for her own pet slushfund, but rather for a world bank controlled fund that she is not able to touch. </p>

<p>If I showed hillary clinton I am a boss like that, you could call me a fat retard to my face, my only reply would be, &quot;3 to one, threeee, to one, neeener neener neener, three to 1...&quot;</p>

<p>Plus, if you actually consider airhead an insult, I would consider it a fact of life. </p>

<p>She is not like you and me. her financial stability is so big, all you can do is  go hrm, I really wish I had that. She is at the point in life where she does not have to worry about money, she has fuck it money. That brings with it that you are not like ordinary people, you are not standing with both feet in the grind, hitting that 9-5, that means you loose a bit of that every day spirit, that idea of where precisely you are. Like an airhead, floating 15 cm above ground. </p>

<p>BUT, and this is important, not only does she outraise clinton 3:1 on feminism issues, she has her own brand, has written multiple books, has a husband, her own home,  3 children , she has found religion, AND she does all of this without a single paid dollar, most likely to give the first lady an opportunity to not stand in a rain of flashlights and give little barron a chance to have at least something resembling a childhood and help her father.....</p>

<p>It is interresting to be disturbed by the allegation of being an airhead. You could not do what she does and retain a functional braincell. You would break apart at the age of 30, and be done with it. </p>

<p>So, by all accounts, she may not have the best brain and be a bit floaty, but what more then makes up for that is the fact that on the one side, she has 740 Million dollars of self worth to weigh her down, while on the othere side, she has a heart big enough to indulge in typical rich person hobbies and have a relatively quiet life, and to instead seat herself to the right of her father, and despite media protests, sit it out to make life a bit easier for herself, her father, her mother and baron. </p>

<p>You&#39;d have to have only a couple of functioning braincells to not take the easy way out of that, and opt for the comfy life. She doesn&#39;t. As long as she is comfortably standing and does not have trouble breathing and swallowing at the same time, she has done more in her life then either me or you ever will. </p>

<li>Ivanka has no role, directly or indirectly, in the operation of this fund. It&#39;s run by the World Bank. (We could have a conversation on the World Bank, Trump, and globalism, but this is not that.)</li>
<li>HRC was intimately involved in the Clinton Foundation. They actively sought donations, were involved the the disbursement of funds, and Bill and Chelsea were on the board. </li>
</ul>

<p>You don&#39;t even have to think HRC did anything unethical regarding the CF; these scenarios are still not analogous in the least. With CF, there was at least the potential for the <em>appearance</em> of a conflict of interest. What&#39;s the conflict of interest here? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>When I said that both HRC and Trump are two sides of the same coin I meant that they&#39;re both globalist pawns. It&#39;s arguable that Trump may not have been one initially (I really do believe that at some point he actually had good intentions for the American people) but now the deep state has him by the balls and they aren&#39;t letting go. He&#39;s doomed.</p>

<p>Of course there are many differences between HRC and Trump and I would take a Trump presidency over a Clinton one any day but we both know that presidents don&#39;t run the show. HRC is a literal psychopath though so I suppose this is one major difference between the two but they&#39;re both on a tight chain, sadly. </p>

<p>There is a natural overlap between the audiences of these subreddits because there is reason to believe that Donald Trump is attempting to destroy the NWO/Deep State.  </p>

<p>Now, not everybody believes that to be true, but there are still a number of reasons to believe it is possible. That doesn&#39;t mean <a href="/r/The_Donald">/r/The_Donald</a> is taking over. Trump supporters are welcome to use this subreddit just like anyone else. They are just not allowed to shitpost memes or call people cucks. So what?  </p>

<p>And it&#39;s not an award. It&#39;s a gift for showing up. Kinda like when you go to a dinner party, you bring a bottle of wine. The wine isn&#39;t an award for anything. Neither is the necklace.</p>

<p>Can you provide any source, link, anything at all, that proves that him accepting the necklace means he&#39;s also accepted whatever title you claim it infers?</p>

<p>And remember, it&#39;s not up to me or the other commenter. Burden of proof is always on the claimant. Claimant in this case is you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok, sorry for the late reply.  Yes to the respect thing.  Let me explain why I pointed you to google.  The pic above only shows Trump with the Saudi king.  It kinda look like he&#39;s wearing a Yamulke.  I thought op was cracking a joke because of Trump&#39;s funky hair and the fact you would not wear a Yamulke when meeting with a Muslim King.  However I see some pics now on other posts of Trump at the Holocaust memorial in Yamulke and that for sure was done out of respect.  I did not see any pics of Trump at the memorial or any mention by op that he was referring to a separate event from the one listed above, hence my recommendation for google.  I thought you were assuming he wore a Yamulke to show respect to the Saudis, hence my sarcasm.  Sorry for the confusion.</p>

<p>Not glossing over. Friends or acquaintances, they ran in the same circles. And then when it was revealed that Epstein was a child sex offender, Trump did what most people would do and cut ties. I don&#39;t find this curious, it&#39;s the absolute expected response in this situation, what most people I know would do.</p>

<p>I do find it curious that no other elites followed suit, and that you are still trying to twist the distancing somehow while ignoring that EVERYONE else didn&#39;t even both to cut ties, and still associate freely and warmly. I&#39;d like you to explain your thought process on this particular bit, if you would. </p>

Yup nothing to see here folks, just totally normal for a family member of a president to push products on you. </p>

<p>Plus the rumor going around saying that she and the kush asked Flynn to remain loyal and he will be rewarded. Not gonna even bother posting a link cause I&#39;m pretty sure you&#39;ll just label it as fake news. Obviously /pol/ hasn&#39;t confirmed it so it can&#39;t be real. </p>

<p>What a shitty source btw, I don&#39;t even have ad-blocker and it&#39;s behind a paywall. But what because Conway mentioned how her clothing line was getting dropped because of politics? On Fox? Do you even watch Fox? Why does it matter to you how she sustains herself? So because she&#39;s not a career politician? So she gets to pocket profits her personal company. Which she spent years of her life working on. While being a <em>UNPAID</em> advisor. That&#39;s your arguement? Sounds more of a question of morals <strong>if anything</strong> rather than a conspiracy. </p>

<p>Come up with a better arguement. There&#39;s a lot more shit I&#39;m sure you could come up with (and stuff that is actually bad and probably would change my views on the whole matter don&#39;t get me wrong) But you are indeed talking to a wall, because we&#39;re trying to build it and you&#39;re throwing eggshells. </p>

<p>Going off on a tangent because no body will read this buried post between you and I. The difference between our views seems to be that I don&#39;t assume I know what to do to curb and stop ISIS, maybe we need the King of the Saudi Arabia on our side against ISIS, maybe selling them more arms means we need to intervene less (less boots on the ground) or maybe it doesn&#39;t and we end up causing even more chaos.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not happy with Trump&#39;s big arms sale nor am I happy with his missile and MOAB strike but I also don&#39;t assume to know what else is better. We are just normies and not the leaders of the world all we can do is learn and distribute information and maybe run for office.</p>

<p>Are you kidding? Besides her husband&#39;s family selling citizenship to Chinese for $500k a pop, she has also been given 3 trademarks in China that she was previously denied before her father became president. She&#39;s a senior advisor to the president and hasn&#39;t divested <em>at all</em> from her company. If you can&#39;t see the <strong>many</strong> conflicts or problems with Ivanka, you are just being willfully blind.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Doug Band, the former Clinton aide, first complains to Podesta that he had heard that Chelsea Clinton had told one of George W. Bush’s daughters that she was conducting an investigation of Clinton Foundation finances. “Not smart,” Band says.</p>

<p>Podesta replies, “You are perfecting your skills for understatement.”</p>

<p>“I learned from the best,” answers Band. Then he adds, ominously: “The investigation into her getting paid for campaigning, using foundation resources for her wedding and life for a decade, taxes on money from her parents….I hope you will speak to her and end this. Once we go down this road….”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This exchange is literally the only evidence that exists to support the Clinton wedding scandal. Parts of it don&#39;t even make sense. Clinton told a Bush kid she (Chelsea Clinton) was investigating the Clinton Foundation&#39;s money stuff. Why would she do that if she was allegedly responsible for skimming money? I&#39;ve always interpreted this email as Band is afraid of Chelsea&#39;s investigation, and is willing to go after her to protect himself. Also, &quot;resources&quot; doesn&#39;t mean it paid for the wedding. Who knows wtf that means. </p>

<p>Furthermore, there&#39;s no mention of aid for Haiti as you implied. Obviously, the exchange seems shady, and hints at definite unethical behavior. But you&#39;re speaking very matter-of-factly about something that is not a matter of fact.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s not at all what I said. The notion that Trump is doing the same corrupt things as the Clintons is <em>part of</em> the very conspiracy I just mentioned to destroy his presidency.  </p>

<p>This is the great information war. I can&#39;t tell anyone else what to believe. However, my gut instinct tells me that criminals infiltrated government, intelligence agencies, law enforcement, and media decades ago. Now the media and Deep State is legitimately trying to destroy Trump because Trump is legitimately trying to destroy the most powerful criminal organization in history. Their propaganda is very strong, but the narrative they are pushing is completely fake.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll throw this here... also called Abiotic Oil.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abiogenic_petroleum_origin">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abiogenic_petroleum_origin</a></p>

<p>In short, it explains there&#39;s a way to actually create petrol and that it&#39;s not fossil fuel (apparently &quot;fossil fuel&#39; was a term created for americans and the propaganda about oil -- to verify). From what I understand, the process looks a lot like the way fraking is done; you injected water into a &quot;hot chamber&quot; with carbon. So anyway, it can be done with an empty well. That could explain the BP leak and also the fact some well stopped producing for a few years and then &quot;magically&quot; started producing even more petrol than before (that was in the same area as the BP platform, can&#39;t remember the name.)</p>

<p>ANYWAY. The point is:</p>

<p>Saudi Arabia&#39;s economy relies a lot of petrol (probably mostly on). If USA would end up &quot;creating his petrol&quot; or revealing this, it would weaken the Saudis to a dangerous point. So what I thought is that the trade Trump did was actually like a &quot;you&#39;re fired&quot; last bonus cheque or like a compensation when you break a contract.</p>

<p>As for why he gave weapons, it makes sense to me. Sunni muslims is a branch that has the most differences in the faith of the most to the least believer, and also pretty much all the terrorists/extremists. They&#39;re also the majority but pretty much all small groups of sunni considers each other &quot;fake muslim&quot;. So every freaking Sunni group is doing a witch hunt on each others or pointing fingers.</p>

<p>Giving weapons to Saudi will help them submit all these small groups of Sunni to the bigger group and make the Sunni&#39;s faith more homogeneous — and also have one common interpretation, unlike now.</p>

<p>I also suspect that mass migration to europe was actually a trap to the &quot;lower&quot; Sunni. Notice how the terrorists keep saying they were given permission by Allah. I&#39;m quite certain some of their corrupted leaders told them to leave for europe... leaving lands like Syria easier to be taken since the rats are out. I could totally see Saudi doing a campaign like this, a bit as Palestinians did to their own people. There&#39;s really a plan to grab land in this but what Trump did probably stop the original plan and now they&#39;ll do it the &quot;legit&quot; way.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why in earth would I think that? Retail stores are simply out to make a profit, like any store. </p>

<p>Now if there was one particular store with an elderly long time owner who had a life long track record of selling garbage products, blatant lying to employees and customers, bullying people with lawyers, and not paying his workers, then yea, maybe I wouldn&#39;t trust that specific retail store with my business. </p>
