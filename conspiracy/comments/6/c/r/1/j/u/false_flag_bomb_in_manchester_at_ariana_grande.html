<p>It&#39;s early days, but I&#39;m skeptical. </p>

<p>EDIT: I agree, it&#39;s too early to call this a false flag... hence the question mark. 
So, now is the time to gather genuine reactions before everything gets buried under the &#39;official narrative&#39;. It&#39;s time for the citizen investigation to commence. </p>

<p>EDIT: Someone posted about a possible false flag 16 hours ago: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6clvfp/false_flag_watch_for_52217/">https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6clvfp/false_flag_watch_for_52217/</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>No. If you actually look at the recent London Westminster bridge attack, there is a prop being used in place of a man.  Use your critical thinking - I don&#39;t jump to the conclusion that all the injuries are fake, but sometimes they definitely are. I will find a video proving the above for you. I see where you are coming from but no, sometimes props have been used, and injuries have been faked (injured interviewees in hospital dressed in own clothes with no IV drip after gunshots... With no scratches on them, etc).  I think there are real injuries, and then there are the fake injuries on actors who are going to be interviewed, or to create a specific scene of ... Amputees after Boston marathon for example </p>

We&#39;re just skeptic. And if you don&#39;t know nothing about Freemasons, Skull &amp; Bones, Jesuits, Malta Knights, AstroNOTS, Rothschilds.. (many more) then don&#39;t say we&#39;re discussing, we&#39;re skeptic! If 500 out of the billion people on earth claim they have a picture of Loch Ness. Would you believe and trust them? Probably, we are skeptic and say &#39;don&#39;t you see the photo&#39;s of these people could be manipulated?!&#39; Because it&#39;s on the news, you trust it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>C&#39;mon. At concerts there are thousands of people with cameras. In any REAL attack, there are GRAPHIC videos almost immediately. All I see are some booms played on the loudspeakers, and photos of people running away, which is typical of false flag attacks.</p>

<p>Is this a false flag?</p>

<p>Since it&#39;s so soon, I deduct it at 80% probable.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This does stink false flag big time (which is not saying that there may not be victims but some still confuse false flag with fake).
Where are all the hundreds of pictures and videos you&#39;d expect? Aren&#39;t all those kids recording and taking pictures during a concert? Surely someone would have been recording when the thing went off if it did.
I did a brief search for media and all I have seen is like the same pictures of 2 people with a knee bandage and a girl with something that looks like blood spread on her hair, a dashcam showing nothing but just some big boom sound, and the rest showing people running around more confused. None of that proves anything and is easily faked and people are easily scared into running without having seen anything.
I also saw some video of someone there wondering why people are overreacting like nothing much happened. There is also some tweet about some official coming on stage saying it&#39;s nothing and to calm down.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s odd how they couldn&#39;t see what happened from inside the stadium yet everyone reacted off each other&#39;s reaction which waterfell into blind panic. Exaggerated reactions from hired heads was kind of suspicious as I watched the two videos on scene.. No footage of aftermath, which seems rare considering a popular concert full of teens didn&#39;t film at all. The police and ambulance crews (which seemed to already be in numbers on standby) are now telling people to stay away from the area where they may conduct their investigation on this &#39;event&#39;. This is fucked up brothers and sisters. I dont know what to make of this.

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not too early at all. When the conspiracy theories have predictive power, they stop being theories. The last attack was in Paris on the eve of the election as the left-ist candidate was gaining momentum. I predicted an attack and it happened. Same thing in this case. Corbyn is gaining momentum and it had to be stopped. Lo and behold, another attack. If his trajectory continues, there&#39;ll be another attack. The people of Britain must recognize this for what it is and not cave to the fear. They must be an example for the word and take back their country from the bankers, corporations and war-profiteers. Their tactics are craven, brazen and so obvious now. Resist the fear.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And how this actually proves it was a false flag?</p>

<p>Similar announcements with weak facts are given almost everytime when this type of attacks or similar level accidents happen. It&#39;s because just minutes after the incident no-one knows what happened; there are no facts to share yet.</p>

<p>This announcement does not prove false flag nor hoax. When &quot;MV Sewol&quot; capsized, sunk and over 300 drowned - most of them young students - there was also misinformative announcements given via speakers. So, do you think this fact - the misinformative announcement - means Sewol disaster was a hoax and the ferry did not sink at all?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Have you all noticed how suggesting it&#39;s a false flag is quickly heavily criticized as being super disrespectful to the victims&#39; families, see how X factor&#39;s Steve Brookstein got slammed for suggesting that. Why would be trying to understand who did the horrific act be so disrespectful? I never get that... If there are victims, we are always on their side. We just disagree on who did it.
Suggesting that it could be a false flag by some right wing extremist is perfectly OK though (CNN&#39;s Paul Cruickshank story)!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No. If you actually look at the recent London Westminster bridge attack, there is a prop being used in place of a man.  Use your critical thinking - I don&#39;t jump to the conclusion that all the injuries are fake, but sometimes they definitely are. I will find a video proving the above for you. I see where you are coming from but no, sometimes props have been used, and injuries have been faked (injured interviewees in hospital dressed in own clothes with no IV drip after gunshots... With no scratches on them, etc).  I think there are real injuries, and then there are the fake injuries on actors who are going to be interviewed, or to create a specific scene of ... Amputees after Boston marathon for example </p>
