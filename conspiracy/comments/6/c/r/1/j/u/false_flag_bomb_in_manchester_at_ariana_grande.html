       Will this be used to boost Theresa May's election campaign, while also pushing the need for an armed police state? Or is it a distraction from something else?
      </p>
      <p>
       It's early days, but I'm skeptical.
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT: I agree, it's too early to call this a false flag... hence the question mark. 
So, now is the time to gather genuine reactions before everything gets buried under the 'official narrative'. It's time for the citizen investigation to commence.
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT: Someone posted about a possible false flag 16 hours ago:

       No. If you actually look at the recent London Westminster bridge attack, there is a prop being used in place of a man.  Use your critical thinking - I don't jump to the conclusion that all the injuries are fake, but sometimes they definitely are. I will find a video proving the above for you. I see where you are coming from but no, sometimes props have been used, and injuries have been faked (injured interviewees in hospital dressed in own clothes with no IV drip after gunshots... With no scratches on them, etc).  I think there are real injuries, and then there are the fake injuries on actors who are going to be interviewed, or to create a specific scene of ... Amputees after Boston marathon for example

       Or maybe someone yelled "it's a bomb" because it sounded like a bomb just went off. Why does every single shooting and explosion have to be a false flag, I feel like people these days see an event on the news and think "it's a false flag", and then sift through the evidence trying to confirm that preconceived notion.

       Let's wait for everything to come in and then decide, there's almost no way to tell right now without massive extrapolation.

       Or maybe someone yelled "it's a bomb" because it sounded like a bomb just went off. Why does every single shooting and explosion have to be a false flag, I feel like people these days see an event on the news and think "it's a false flag", and then sift through the evidence trying to confirm that preconceived notion.
Let's wait for everything to come in and then decide, there's almost no way to tell right now without massive extrapolation.

       Enough happens in the world to get the media looking the other way without having to resort to a false flag. Idk man, I think connecting the rich story to an explosion in manchester is a huge assumption.

       False flags are meant to draw blood, kill, and stoke fear. It's literally their purpose. Using actors is not only counter productive but stupid.

       Is your first response to any attack anywhere in the world that it's a false flag?

       Sometimes shitty things happen without them being a part of a larger conspiracy.

       And maybe try looking at evidence and drawing a conclusion, rather than choosing a conclusion and then picking evidence that looks like it supports it.

       Yeah all those ragdolls like in the Nice video, I have a hard time believing half the dead counts and even less of the injured counts for these kind of events. They were literally ragdolls filmed in a dramatic rapid switching fashion, but if you press pause, it's a joke, if there's meat and blood, there's dead pigs inside those ragdolls.

       As long as you keep in mind a lot of those "genuine reactions" are coming from people who just came out of a traumatic event, most likely have no idea what happened, and are probably in shock.

       Don't get me wrong though good info is probably somewhere in there because there
       <em>

       Because of the level of coverage, when every politician, celebrity ,and media outlet has to talk about it 24/7 and the story is unavoidable that is very suspicious. people die everyday and nobody gives a s*** why is it that all of a sudden some news stories become the epicenter of everything while others nobody cares about. it's like when they killed Mike Brown why was that story more important than any other shooting story? it screams of the deep State trying to push some narrative.

       Yeah don't assume every tragedy in the world is a false flag. I get the sense that the people that shout false flag the minute an incident occurs seem to get off on it in some twisted way and seem to show excitement in it. Until we have more information anything that is being said on social media etc is just speculation so before we jump to conclusions let's just wait until we've heard more.

       false flag doesn't necessarily mean it didn't happen, just that it was carried out with the knowledge of uk gov to further some fucking agenda, this time we're weeks away from general election and shit like this would very much benefit theresa, who corbyn has been closing in on

       I dont like immediate false flag reaction.  Like show me some video of Blackwater type security details going in mid way through the show before it's brought up.  Or better yet, find me the security company hired for this event.  Bataclan massacre guards seemed to have advanced knowledge.   But just saying false flag after every shitty event just clouds any real false flags.

       I live in Manchester, I didnt hear anything unlike the 96 bomb though that was huge. Im following the local paper, police and UK national news. No body count so i find it strange American media seems to be quoting a body count.

       You are looking at the wrong set of facts. This false flag operation links actually to New Zealand's and Germany's Parliamentary Elections, both ALSO in 2017 and their successful black-co-op to take down 007 today. 007 was about to reveal Kim Dotcom's surname is foolish - but now that is of course too late and we all must adore it.

       I can't tell if you're joking. Doesn't make much sense. Source and reasoning for anything you're saying? And Kim Dotcom changed his last name legally after getting rich from the Dotcom boom.

       They didn't seem to be in convoys and not driving very fast either. Also phone footage of foyer where the bomb went off had no smoke anywhere, neither did the footage of the arena evac. Only footage floating around just shows people running away while other people stand and watch them, or some people being escorted by police with minor lacerations to their legs.

       Link? CBC ain't showing shit and just happened to have reporters in Manchester (uhm, they're usually in London and nowhere else). I just saw a number from the numerology [i]they[/i] seem to believe in, not for what purpose, but it cannot ever be 15 dead, it's always 10,11...or in this case 19. And often the revised, a year later count is a different number entirely.

       Anyway, Syrians and Iraqis ,especially Iraqis, soon 30 years of constant war on them. are martyrs (nevermind if shia, sunni, christian etc.) to the wahhabi/salafist hordes and if that that is even real, is a small cup of tea, the british tax dollars come home to roost. (if real).

       My grandpa had a heart attack a last weekend, and you wouldn't believe it, an abumalce, fire truck, and two cop cars showed up. Too organized. Emergency vehicles aren't supposed to arrive at emergencies that quickly. I have absolutely zero experience in law enforcement, medical field, or emergency response field, but I'm fairly certain I'm qualified to speak on the subject. I looked my Hillary-supporting grandpa in the eye while they pumped liquid chemtrails through a Northrop Grumman made IV bag made of sacrificial children skin into his lizard veins that I'm a cynic, and next time I won't fall for his false flag "heart attack" so I can focus on Seth Rich.

I don't wish people the death. Your world government does!
We're just skeptic. And if you don't know nothing about Freemasons, Skull &amp; Bones, Jesuits, Malta Knights, AstroNOTS, Rothschilds.. (many more) then don't say we're discussing, we're skeptic! If 500 out of the billion people on earth claim they have a picture of Loch Ness. Would you believe and trust them? Probably, we are skeptic and say 'don't you see the photo's of these people could be manipulated?!' Because it's on the news, you trust it.

       C'mon. At concerts there are thousands of people with cameras. In any REAL attack, there are GRAPHIC videos almost immediately. All I see are some booms played on the loudspeakers, and photos of people running away, which is typical of false flag attacks.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is this a false flag?

       Since it's so soon, I deduct it at 80% probable.

       A friend of mine that was at the concert said that there was little to no security checks for people with backpacks. This may be hearsay but considering just the night before she played in Dublin where security was mandated to check most concert goers bags.

       This does stink false flag big time (which is not saying that there may not be victims but some still confuse false flag with fake).
Where are all the hundreds of pictures and videos you'd expect? Aren't all those kids recording and taking pictures during a concert? Surely someone would have been recording when the thing went off if it did.
I did a brief search for media and all I have seen is like the same pictures of 2 people with a knee bandage and a girl with something that looks like blood spread on her hair, a dashcam showing nothing but just some big boom sound, and the rest showing people running around more confused. None of that proves anything and is easily faked and people are easily scared into running without having seen anything.
I also saw some video of someone there wondering why people are overreacting like nothing much happened. There is also some tweet about some official coming on stage saying it's nothing and to calm down.

       It's odd how they couldn't see what happened from inside the stadium yet everyone reacted off each other's reaction which waterfell into blind panic. Exaggerated reactions from hired heads was kind of suspicious as I watched the two videos on scene.. No footage of aftermath, which seems rare considering a popular concert full of teens didn't film at all. The police and ambulance crews (which seemed to already be in numbers on standby) are now telling people to stay away from the area where they may conduct their investigation on this 'event'. This is fucked up brothers and sisters. I dont know what to make of this. We'll see how this unfolds..

       Difficult to say, with the elections coming up and teresa may also recieving a large amount of backlash for back tracking on things she has said and refusing to debate corbyn she needs something to distract the population, however i am also in the belief that the conservatives and the elite want corbyn to win, to destroy labour because of the way they will tackle brexit, so really i am unsure.

If this was done by a Muslim and as a person who grew up in a Muslim family I think all Muslims should be rounded up and given mental health checks.

       It's not too early at all. When the conspiracy theories have predictive power, they stop being theories. The last attack was in Paris on the eve of the election as the left-ist candidate was gaining momentum. I predicted an attack and it happened. Same thing in this case. Corbyn is gaining momentum and it had to be stopped. Lo and behold, another attack. If his trajectory continues, there'll be another attack. The people of Britain must recognize this for what it is and not cave to the fear. They must be an example for the word and take back their country from the bankers, corporations and war-profiteers. Their tactics are craven, brazen and so obvious now. Resist the fear.

       And how this actually proves it was a false flag?
      </p>
      <p>
       Similar announcements with weak facts are given almost everytime when this type of attacks or similar level accidents happen. It's because just minutes after the incident no-one knows what happened; there are no facts to share yet.
      </p>
      <p>
       This announcement does not prove false flag nor hoax. When "MV Sewol" capsized, sunk and over 300 drowned - most of them young students - there was also misinformative announcements given via speakers. So, do you think this fact - the misinformative announcement - means Sewol disaster was a hoax and the ferry did not sink at all?

       Have you all noticed how suggesting it's a false flag is quickly heavily criticized as being super disrespectful to the victims' families, see how X factor's Steve Brookstein got slammed for suggesting that. Why would be trying to understand who did the horrific act be so disrespectful? I never get that... If there are victims, we are always on their side. We just disagree on who did it.
Suggesting that it could be a false flag by some right wing extremist is perfectly OK though (CNN's Paul Cruickshank story)!

       They didn't seem to be in convoys and not driving very fast either. Also phone footage of foyer where the bomb went off had no smoke anywhere, neither did the footage of the arena evac. Only footage floating around just shows people running away while other people stand and watch them, or some people being escorted by police with minor lacerations to their legs.

       My grandpa had a heart attack a last weekend, and you wouldn't believe it, an abumalce, fire truck, and two cop cars showed up. Too organized. Emergency vehicles aren't supposed to arrive at emergencies that quickly. I have absolutely zero experience in law enforcement, medical field, or emergency response field, but I'm fairly certain I'm qualified to speak on the subject. I looked my Hillary-supporting grandpa in the eye while they pumped liquid chemtrails through a Northrop Grumman made IV bag made of sacrificial children skin into his lizard veins that I'm a cynic, and next time I won't fall for his false flag "heart attack" so I can focus on Seth Rich.

       No. If you actually look at the recent London Westminster bridge attack, there is a prop being used in place of a man.  Use your critical thinking - I don't jump to the conclusion that all the injuries are fake, but sometimes they definitely are. I will find a video proving the above for you. I see where you are coming from but no, sometimes props have been used, and injuries have been faked (injured interviewees in hospital dressed in own clothes with no IV drip after gunshots... With no scratches on them, etc).  I think there are real injuries, and then there are the fake injuries on actors who are going to be interviewed, or to create a specific scene of ... Amputees after Boston marathon for example
