        Why the DNC/Clinton's had nothing to do with Seth Rich's murder:
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       (btw, I don't have any skin in this.  In fact, I am the one who broke the story that
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/4x6l8m/the_clintons_have_gotten_to_seth_richs_parents/?st=j30mzbpi&amp;sh=e5041dae">
        Seth's parents were/are being silenced
       </a>
       by a DNC operative - Brad Bauman)
      </p>
      <p>
       Per
       <a href="https://crimewatchdaily.com/2016/09/30/exclusive-murdered-dnc-staffers-family-friends-set-record-straight/">
        Crime Watch Daily with Chris Hansen:
       </a>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        <em>
         "The officers who were there and they said 'Yeah, he was quite talkative, he did not realize he had been shot,'" said Joel Rich, Seth's father.
        </em>
       </p>
       <p>
        <em>
         But an hour and a half later at a nearby hospital, Seth was pronounced dead.
        </em>
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       That means after being shot Seth had contact with:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        The responding police.
       </li>
       <li>
        The responding EMT's.
       </li>
       <li>
        Hospital staff.
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       So Seth could have talked to any people listed above about the attempted murder/30,000 emails on his computer.
      </p>
      <p>
       That means the DNC/Clintons would have to immediately:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         know that Seth survived and so they would have to somehow make sure he was put to death in the hospital so he couldn't talk any more (this is probably the biggest flaw in the theory the DNC/Clintons had Seth killed).
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         know he was talkative (see link above).
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         know who the responding officers were so the DNC/Clintons could immediately silence them with threats/etc before they had a chance to talk about what Seth may have told the officers.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         know who the emergency responders were so the DNC/Clintons could immediately silence them with threats/etc before they had a chance to talk  about what Seth may have told the EMT's.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         know all the hospital staff were who had contact with so the DNC/Clintons could immediately silence them with threats/etc before they had a chance to talk  about what Seth may have told all of the hospital staff.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         know who the detectives/FBI agents assigned to the case are so the DNC/Clintons could threaten/etc them to get access to Seth's laptop so the 30,000 emails could be erased.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       In summary, the DNC/Clinton's had nothing to do with Seth Rich's murder; it was a botched robbery.
      </p>
      <p>
       Case closed.

       The simple idea that a center right political party while not in power can &amp; will assassinate people for "revenge" while announcing it on twitter and then intimidate every single person he was in contact with and the only news agency covering the "truth" happen to be republican affiliated networks shows how ridiculous it is. I mean what sort of shitty assassin gets close enough to tear the guys watch strap in some sort of bizarre struggle (once again why is an assassin getting into a fistfight) and then leave him alive without taking his wallet/watch to make it look like a mugging let alone using a non silenced pistol in a city with gunshot monitors.

       There are two claims that are being conflated. The first is was Seth Rich the source of the DNC emails. As far as I am aware, this is what is being claimed.   It is not contradictory to maintain that he was the source, but was still killed in a botched robbery, although it certainly casts doubt on that narrative.
      </p>
      <p>
       What would be completely destroyed is the narrative that the hacks were done by a foreign entity? Then the question is going to be is the intelligence community incompetent or were they in on it.

       even if he did leak them the idea that the DNC is on the level of putin and has assasins at their beck &amp; call to do revenge killings is absurd not to mention as putin has shown when you do a revenge killing you make it obvious AF to people you did it by killing them with radiation poisoning not make it so the theory is so absurd that only republican partisans and conspiracy theorists that nobody takes seriously support it.

       Putting aside the anti-Russian rhetoric here, what is absurd about a political powerhouse being connected?  The notion that power-elites don't utilize assassination, or don't have mob connection or whatever is false. I am not saying this is what happened in this case, as there is no evidence, but I see no reason a priori to reject it.

       There are several things that are false in your statements. The first is that its only republican partisans or conspiracy theorists are pushing for this. The second is that conspiracy theories are not taken seriously.  In fact we know they are, there are academic works about how conspiracy theories make effective governing difficult domestically, and how proliferation of conspiracy theories in the Middle East is a problem for American foreign policy.

       "anti russian rhetoric" how is it anti russian rhetoric to use an actual political revenge assassination as a example? oh right because anything bad about russia is automatically propaganda even when you are only using them as an example. "the notion that power-elites don't utilize assassinations" when did i ever say that i said the exact opposite considering i gave an EXAMPLE of power elites using assassinations proving i believe they do happen, just the fact that they do use them doesn't mean every single person who dies that has political ties was an assassination especially if the theory is completely an utterly absurd it in its logic of "elites use assasination sometimes thus it must be assasination"

       I think we are in agreement that the power-elites connected to the DNC could have people assassinated, but there is no evidence that they assassinated Seth Rich.

       This would be a wrong inference to draw.  However the position that elites do use assassination therefore it is possible that this was an assassination is not a false inference. It is just not supported.

       it is logically absurd why would the DNC kill someone for revenge risking the entire party's credibility if it was exposed in order while gaining nothing. And the sheer amount of power the DNC is required for the assassination to occur then cover up that is being equated to the party that just lost almost all the elections that mattered apart from Obama is absurd.

       There is nothing absurd here. All you are presenting is an argument from incredulity.  Might as well wonder why the mob kills its own guys if it brings more attention to the organization.

        And the sheer amount of power the DNC is required for the assassination to occur then cover up that is being equated to the party that just lost almost all the elections that mattered apart from Obama is absurd.

      <p>
       It is clear that the Clinton faction has the support of the deep state here. Other than the Comey blip prior the election, which seems to have been necessary to pacify the FBI internally, she has their full support.

       because the mob can easily be destroyed by one person snitching so they kill each traitors to enforce loyalty it makes sense a political party much less so because there are constant leaks as this election &amp; government has shown and cracking down only makes them worse. And here you bias shows where you think clinton is deep state while the far more authoritarian "increase the spying from the patriot act that obama cut back on &amp; lock up journalists trump" is not.

       The mob has plenty of leaks and it wasn't brought down.  Moreover, I beg to disagree about the government crackdown.  Obama's policy of locking up whistle blowers has had a chilling effect throughout.

       that's easily a inference the deep state is part of state &amp; expanding upon that is authority and authoritarianism and libertarianism is about limiting the states influence thus limiting the deep state, to say that its not is absurd. Yeah Obama was hard on whistleblowers but if you listened to republicans they were even harsher asking for the death penalty &amp; life sentences , trump called them treasonous at one point i believe, they are always worse.

       <p>
        According to the Family Jewels documents released, members of the American mafia were involved in CIA attempts to assassinate Cuban leader Fidel Castro.[15] The documents showed that the CIA recruited Robert Maheu, an ex-FBI agent and aide to Howard Hughes in Las Vegas, to approach Johnny Roselli under the pretense of representing international corporations that wanted Castro dead due to lost gambling interests.[15] Roselli introduced Maheu to mobster leaders Sam Giancana and Santo Trafficante, Jr..[15] Supplied with six poison pills from the CIA, Gianacana and Trafficante tried unsuccessfully to have people place the poison in Castro's food.[1

       It was done to address your point concerning the deep state. What I maintain is that at this point there is no evidence that he was assassinated.  This is different then rejecting the possibility a priori.

      <p>
       Whether one is more authoritarian or not has no bearing on whether they are preferred by the deep state.
      </p>
      <p>
       The deep state consists of many extra government bodies, like defense contractors and organized crime.

       Clinton was preferred by the deep state.

       There is no evidence that Rich was assassinated at this point.

       If Rich was the leaker, that in itself might be enough to destroy the  DNC, as they were pushing the Russia angle.

       the FBI also pushed the russian angle people tend to forget that, how would liberalism not adversely affect the widely authoritarian government deep state that it would cut back the influence of things like homeland security &amp; spying &amp; defence contracts are all very pro republican base anti democrat base things to say they aren't is just plain ignorant. Liberalism is anti controlling government the deepstate is literally about a controlling government to say that liberalism does not oppose that is absurd

       Wait...what?   Liberalism  does not mean cutting back on government intervention in the American context.  Liberalism here is ill defined, and generally means something like, I care about social issues and want to help poor people.   It does not mean classical liberalism.  Moreover both parties, are neo-liberal in policies and viewpoints.   There is something called the Washington consensus.  I think we are living in the era where its becoming splintered, but the deep state is still committed to it.

       Well, the people surrounding the crime do all have connections to the DNC and SEIU (responding officer, bar owner, and medical staff). So the OP is claiming such thinking is ridiculous and far-fetched, when in reality it is exactly how inter-connected capitol hill is. All his "debunking" kind of further helps prove the point of how suspicious it was.

       it wasnt suspicious at all whats suspicious is that the story was spread by pro corporate rag fox news 2 hours after the comey firing and the entire right wing media lit on fire with the story completely distracting from trump, the amount of "connections" that have to be assumed and then power given to the DNC to control people in this case shows how blatantly partisan and bullshit the whole thing is,
      </p>
      <p>
       occam's razor: the sheer amount of assumptions about the DNC having nigh unlimited power in this theory pretty much disproves it.

       Good post. 
Playing devil's advocate here, a gunshot would have likely had investigating officers regardless.  Being in power they could simply make sure the first officers on the scene was paid off or in on it beforehand. It's more likely he'd tell them if he was going to tell anyone, that's not information the hospital staff would need know and likely wouldn't come up.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also they say he was very talkative, meaning he was conscience enough to not be suffering massive blood loss right away.  Your chances of dying from blood loss decrease immensely once you've made it to a hospital, yet he still died, in spite of being there for an hour.  I believe it was George Webb who reported that he was isolated to a single surgeon.  Again, this would have been planned ahead of time.
      </p>

       Sorry for formatting and lack of sources ahead of time, I'm on mobile.  Thoughts and help sourcing would be appreciated.  I'll update more when I get home.

       I understand that's the belief of this sub.  That doesn't change anything.  Really all I wanted was another thought out discussion of the hypotheticals involved.  If you know anything at all about this sub than you'll realize all the information we have both ways is made up of nearly all lies.  Any idea you think you have of what's going on is false if your buying in to either of the narratives.

       You're not following man.  Everything we get from any source or form of media is filtered.  Whether it's by a big media conglomerate or the mind of an independent journalist.  There doesn't exist a person without an agenda.  How do you not see it when there is ALWAYS 2 narratives being pushed down our throats.

       Hi there, are you familiar with the DC metro area? I can tell you that it is very strange for a botched robbery turned murder in this area to get the amount of coverage initially that it id. There are cameras everywhere on the exact spot where he was found and in EVERY other case where a guy was shot in D.C. they would put still pics or A sketch on local T.V. there has never EVER been a murder case like the Seth Rich case here with such a blatant, obvious media blackout and govt not saying a WORD. It's insanity and for those of us who live here, it scares the living shit out of us.﻿

       I agree. Kim Dot Com blew his credibility last year with his constantly claiming wikileaks bombshells that never dropped. On Rich, real assassins would have finished the job. They wouldn't have made any noise (The person on the phone with Seth says she heard voices). Plus, we know Podesta and the DCCC were also hacked. The DNC was likely hacked, but not likely by the Russians. Just by hackers looking to expose corruption.

       Interesting scenario, though wouldn't say case closed.
      </p>
      <p>
       This narrative would rely on the assumption that Seth Rich knew who the shooter was, or knew who sent the shooter, and that he would blab about his involvement in the leaks openly.
      </p>
      <p>
       I doubt someone would send a postcard to their target saying "Hi, we're onto you and we just sent a hitman your way, good luck! &lt;3". Nor would the hitman walk up and hand him his business card. It could have been a real mugging, it could have also been a hit disguised as a mugging. The "botched" part makes it suspicious. There were no eyewitnesses, so if they went through the trouble of shooting a man, one would expect at least a wallet taken.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, I can think of more reasons to
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       blab about being the source of a leaker to everyone you see than otherwise, even if you had a possibly fatal gunshot wound. If you consider Rich didn't even know he was shot, it's not far fetched to say he could have underestimated the severity of his situation and didn't feel the need to give a death bed confession.
      </p>
      <p>
       I agree with the Kim Dotcom stuff though, I think he's just trying to stay relevant by clinging on to Wikileaks' coattails. Put up or shut up, Kim.

       Here's a thought: he was just fucking shot, and in shock bleeding out and talking nonsense. The police and emts know he's in bad shape and don't listen to a word he's saying because they heard the same story last week from the homeless dude they had to take the ER.
      </p>
      <p>
       The hospital staff also reacts similarly, and Seth possibly thought he might make it. There was no death bed confession because he died suddenly of his injuries.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is just as possible and doesn't involve paying anyone off. Seth may not have even known his killer, or even connected the dots that he was being taken out by the DNC. He knew he had heat on him, but that doesn't mean he fully understood what was happening in that moment, and again was shot and probably in shock.
