<p>Whatever your religious or spiritual beliefs, I believe it is extremely important to have a fundamental understanding of different worldviews. I want to create a discussion on a few key religious beliefs, and it is important to note that I am not preaching. Rather, I have found that many are not that interested in conspiracies tied to spirituality. However, is it possible that the ultimate conspiracy is tied to spiritual warfare on a large scale?</p>

<p>If nothing else, this post is meant to break up all of the donald controversy right now. Please do not downvote because you do not like Christianity. As always, I love discussion and enjoy digging deeper into conspiracies.</p>

<p><strong>What are the characteristics of the Jewish messiah?</strong></p>

<p>The Jews do not accept Jesus as their messiah. Here are some of the characteristics of the messiah they expect:</p>

<p>*The Jewish idea of mashiach is a great human leader like King David, not a savior</p>

<p><a href="http://www.jewfaq.org/m/mashiach.htm">http://www.jewfaq.org/m/mashiach.htm</a></p>

<p>*He will bring peace among all nations (Isaiah 2:4; Micah 4:3)</p>

<p>*He will bring perfect harmony and abundance in nature (Isaiah 11:6-9) (but some interpret this as an allegory for peace and prosperity): </p>

<p><a href="http://www.religionfacts.com/judaism/messiah">http://www.religionfacts.com/judaism/messiah</a></p>

<p>*The final Messiah will be the greatest leader and political genius that the world has ever seen. He will likewise be the wisest man ever to have lived. He will put these extraordinary talents to use to precipitate a worldwide revolution which will bring perfect social justice to humanity, and influence all people to serve God with a pure heart.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.aish.com/jl/li/m/48944241.html?mobile=yes">http://www.aish.com/jl/li/m/48944241.html?mobile=yes</a></p>

<p>*All the nations of the world will recognize Moshiach to be a world leader, and will accept his dominion. In the messianic era there will be world peace, no more wars nor famine, and, in general, a high standard of living.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/108400/jewish/The-End-of-Days.htm">http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/108400/jewish/The-End-of-Days.htm</a></p>

<p><strong>What do Christians believe about the anti-Christ?</strong></p>

<p>Christians do accept Jesus as their savior, and the new testament outlines characteristics of the anti-Christ.</p>

<p>*The Antichrist will use the power given to him to make peace. In fact, he will accomplish a peace treaty with Israel. However, it will only be effective for 3.5 years. He will break that treaty and start to persecute God’s people.</p>

<p>*He will have a “bold countenance” with “intrigue” meaning that he will have a mysterious ability to attract attention and favor from other political leaders.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/jimerwin/2015/11/17/eight-characteristics-of-the-antichrist/">http://www.patheos.com/blogs/jimerwin/2015/11/17/eight-characteristics-of-the-antichrist/</a></p>

<p>*He will control the world&#39;s economy:</p>

<p>Whoever rules the world’s goods rules the unsaved world. This man will have “forced all people, great and small, rich and poor, free and slave, to receive a mark on their right hands or on their foreheads, so that they could not buy or sell unless they had the mark, which is the name of the beast or the number of its name“ (Rev 13:16-17). When people start getting hungry, they will do almost anything to keep from starving. Even submit to an ungodly ruler. He causes everyone to receive a mark so that they can’t even buy food or any goods at all unless they have his mark upon them. This is also mimicking the sovereign God who gives to all, great and small, the sustenance to survive. The Anti-Christ makes everyone receive his mark but this mark comes with a great price.</p>

<p>*He will deny the true God and Jesus.</p>

<p>There are more characteristics that I find interesting here:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.stempublishing.com/authors/fereday/ANTICHRS.html">http://www.stempublishing.com/authors/fereday/ANTICHRS.html</a></p>

<p><strong>Could it be that this anti-Christ will deceive the Jews into believing he is their messiah?</strong></p>

<p>Many on this subreddit discuss the New World Order (NWO), but some fail to see that the bible expresses prophecies about this new world order.</p>

<p>Mark of the beast? One world currency?</p>

<p><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/13-17.htm">http://biblehub.com/revelation/13-17.htm</a></p>

<p>Get ready for a one world currency by 2018:</p>

<p><a href="https://socioecohistory.wordpress.com/2014/07/26/flashback-1988-get-ready-for-a-world-currency-by-2018%E2%80%B3-the-economist-magazine/">https://socioecohistory.wordpress.com/2014/07/26/flashback-1988-get-ready-for-a-world-currency-by-2018%E2%80%B3-the-economist-magazine/</a></p>

<p><a href="http://money.cnn.com/2017/01/04/news/india/india-cash-crisis-rupee/">http://money.cnn.com/2017/01/04/news/india/india-cash-crisis-rupee/</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.valuewalk.com/2017/05/bitcoin-cashless-society/">http://www.valuewalk.com/2017/05/bitcoin-cashless-society/</a></p>

<p>Second, the world could be fooled by those who claim to be Jews, but are they actually part of the synagogue of Satan as mentioned in the bible?</p>

<p><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/3-9.htm">http://biblehub.com/revelation/3-9.htm</a></p>

<p><a href="http://blogs.timesofisrael.com/leaked-report-israel-acknowledges-jews-in-fact-khazars-secret-plan-for-reverse-migration-to-ukraine/">http://blogs.timesofisrael.com/leaked-report-israel-acknowledges-jews-in-fact-khazars-secret-plan-for-reverse-migration-to-ukraine/</a></p>

<p>There is a lot more you can research in regards to the fact that there will be those who misrepresent themselves as Jewish, but this is a starting point. </p>

<p><em>Let us not forget the Georgia Guidestones. These seem to be principles for this NWO:</em></p>

<p>*Maintain humanity under 500,000,000 in perpetual balance with nature.</p>

<p>*Guide reproduction wisely — improving fitness and diversity.</p>

<p>*Unite humanity with a living new language.</p>

<p>*Rule passion — faith — tradition — and all things with tempered reason.</p>

<p>*Protect people and nations with fair laws and just courts.</p>

<p>*Let all nations rule internally resolving external disputes in a world court.</p>

<p>*Avoid petty laws and useless officials.</p>

<p>*Balance personal rights with social duties.
Prize truth — beauty — love — seeking harmony with the infinite.</p>

<p>*Be not a cancer on the earth — Leave room for nature — Leave room for nature</p>

<p>Is this the perfect new world many are waiting for? Will the anti-Christ deceive all in setting up this &quot;perfect&quot; world? Is the Jewish messiah the Christian anti-Christ?</p>

<p><strong>Well, why do Christians think Jesus is the savior?</strong></p>

<p>Again, it is important that you research all of this yourself, but here is a good starting point:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.equip.org/article/jesus-is-the-messiah/">http://www.equip.org/article/jesus-is-the-messiah/</a></p>

<p>I put this in here for those who really never looked into this information.</p>

<p><strong>But what about Satanism?</strong></p>

<p>Many have been fooled to believe that Satanism is just a religion of reason - that it exists more as a contradiction to ignorance and anti-intellectualism. While that may be the case for some forms or components of Satanism, it is important to note that there are those who truly do worship Satan, perform sacrifices, and participate in Satanic rituals. Even if you do not believe in a Satan figure, there are those who do.</p>

<p>*Lucifer is tied to freemasonry and is said to be misunderstood. I wrote a post about the contrast between the beliefs of Freemasonry and Christianity: </p>

<p> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5w5gfw/there_is_a_lot_of_speculation_about_freemasonry">https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5w5gfw/there_is_a_lot_of_speculation_about_freemasonry</a></p>

<p>*The worship of self is Satanism. Even if there are those who claim Satanism is not tied to the devil, it is clear that the worship of oneself is in direct conflict with the worship of God. Here you can read about modern, LaVeyan Satanism:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.churchofsatan.com/">http://www.churchofsatan.com/</a></p>

<p>The bible states in 2 Timothy 3:</p>

<p>This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come.</p>

<p>2 For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy,</p>

<p>3 Without natural affection, trucebreakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce, despisers of those that are good</p>

<p>Sound like anything going on today?</p>

<p>I would argue that even if one does not worship Satan as a real being, the worship of oneself is Satanic, or, quite simply, Godless.</p>

<p>*There are real cases related to Satanic sacrifices, pedophilia, etc.:</p>

<p>Just do a quick search on google. There are thousands of stories and allegations about elite members being linked to Satanism, sacrifice, and pedophilia. It is up to you to discern what is real or not:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/2906130/edward-heath-satanic-paedophile-ring/">https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/2906130/edward-heath-satanic-paedophile-ring/</a></p>

<p>Satanism and sacrifice are back in style:</p>

<p>Honestly I just posted the first links on google in regards to real satanic connections ans sacfrices. It is easy to spend a day and do the research yourself.</p>

<p>Maybe check out the Talmud and its ties to pedophilia while you are at it:</p>

<p><strong>Satanism and Pop Culture</strong></p>

<p>I know many of us on this subreddit ignore pop culture, and for good reason. However, I think there is a lot of evidence that our youth are programmed into &quot;satanic&quot; beliefs through tv, music, books, etc. I could probably write an entire post about this, but I will post a few links for you if you are intrigued. </p>

<p>I can keep going, but I have been writing this post for hours. Even if you do not think the links above are Satanic, they are certainly troubling.</p>

<p>I have found everything is being turned &quot;upside down.&quot; </p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>The conspiracy you may not see may be spiritual. I never believed that was possible, and I used to be a complete atheist, even anti-theist.</p>

<p>It was not until I experienced evil and horror myself that I started to question evil in the first place. I wrote a post about that if you are interested.</p>

<p>It is also important to note that it takes a lot of time and research to understand the bible. Before, I would just believe what others told me about the bible and would isolate verses without context. Now I understand that it is not so simple. There is so much to study, and I spend a lot of my free time doing so. I learned not to take anybody&#39;s word for it.</p>

<p>Finally, the majority of conspiracies on this site are political, but I would argue the ultimate conspiracy is spiritual and played out through politics.</p>

<p>I hope you enjoyed reading, and I look forward to hearing your thoughts.</p>

<p>What did I forget?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Our major modern religions were designed to deter you from your spirituality.  &#39;God&#39; in <em>Le Holy Bible</em> is a Sumerian entity with a new name and many of its stories just rewrites of their myths.  I started a small sub about all this: r/mysterybabylon</p>

<p>So &#39;God&#39; is real but certainly not the almighty creator he&#39;s made out to be.  The <em>god-force</em> is the most real thing of all.  You can find this force within and all around you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well Sabbatea Zevi is a failed Jewish Messiah, however during his time he had over a million followers. He practiced Lurianic Kabbalahism. He believed something like instead of trying to make the whole world good, it would be easier to make everyone evil, and force about the Messiah. So he practiced many sex rituals and weird things like that. Eventually he was forced into converting to Islam, but many believe he and his followers became the Donmeh. Crypto-Jews who would openly practice things like Islam, Christianity, Judaism, but in private follow Sabbatea Zevi&#39;s teachings. Jacob Frank was a disciple of him, and would continue his beliefs. I believe he would go on to work with or become the Illuminati, with Adam Weishupt. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, Sabbatei Zevi was in the year 1666, and the Illuminati was formed in 1776. Khazarian Mafia created the USSR as revenge against Russia, for attacking Khazaria and for helping the American Colonialists during the American Civil War. The Bolsheviks displaced the Christian Monarchy, replacing him with an atheistical dictator, and killed the priests in Russia. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s ok if you are not into it, but Hitler&#39;s Mein Kampf describes the characteristics of Jews very well, they don&#39;t believe in any type of spiritual destiny but are only interested in the pleasures of the world. Since they lack &quot;idealism&quot; the Talmud in a way is a worship of the world&#39;s pleasures. Through the media they desensitise people about things like violence, extreme selfishness, alcohol and bashing any type of weakness. They also push the idea that &quot;we are on our own and that&#39;s the way everything is supposed to work&quot; one of the things they fear is tribalism and healthy nationalism since people being together and forming meaningful bonds with each other is a threat to them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dont forget about the Khazarian Mafia, they blended Judaism with Babylonian Talmudism, which was black magick Occultism, eventually hijacked all of Judaism and spread throughout Europe. They hired Oliver Cromwell to kill the King, and let the Jews back into England, where they could establish the bank of England and practice their Babylonian money magick, with interest. This allowed them to create the British Empire and spread to America. They have had an agenda to displace the Kings of the world appointed by God Almighty, and replace them with Atheistical dictators who use Communism, drugs, slavery, multiculturalism, etc to undermine sovereign nations.</p>

<p>Yes, be a good person, love one another, show compassion.  Forgive those who would turn against you.  But do not be ignorant to the Truth.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>God bless you polkadotgirl!  Praise be to Christ Jesus and LORD Almighty for holy, holy, holy is the LORD Almighty; the whole earth is full of his glory!</p>

<p>You hit the nail on the head sister, and I hope others come to know the truth and grace which is Jesus of Nazareth as well.  It&#39;s imperative that we be strong in the Lord and in the strength of His might.  We must put on the whole armor of God, that we may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil.  For we are not contending against flesh and blood, but against the principalities, against the powers, against the world rulers of this present darkness, against the spiritual hosts of wickedness in the heavenly places.</p>

<p>While we wait for the Lord to return, I often ponder how best to love our enemies and overcome evil.  Recently I&#39;ve come to the following conclusion.  We must fulfill our obligation to the Great Commission.  To overcome the evil/cabal we witness daily, we must grow our numbers, to cause another Great Awakening.  We know the harvest is plentiful, but the laborers are few.  Like the angels in heaven, we must grow our ranks of earth angels, those who evangelize.  Then with any army of saints, we will witness the outpouring of God’s love and protection.</p>

<p>To all, remember, “Blessed are those who wash their robes, that they may have the right to the tree of life and that they may enter the city by the gates.  Outside are the dogs and sorcerers and fornicators and murderers and idolaters, and every one who loves and practices falsehood.  I Jesus have sent my angel to you with this testimony for the churches.  I am the root and the offspring of David, the bright morning star.  The Spirit and the Bride say, “Come.” And let him who hears say, “Come.” And let him who is thirsty come, let him who desires take the water of life without price.”</p>

<p>Finally, polka, you might enjoy the following book as it fits the narrative of your post:  &quot;Illuminati3: Satanic Possession: There is only one Conspiracy&quot; by Henry Makow.  Peace be within you and yours.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Very important aspect of our times that seems to be overlooked or dismissed by majority of ppl. I am Christian who has witnessed over the years the prophecies of Revelation becoming reality in today&#39;s world. Things that were technologically impossible were prophesied thousands of years ago.  </p>

<p>By far 2 of the most tangible ones are the Mark of the Beast and a satanic NWo that will be used by Satan in his last effort to deceive and defeat God in His quest to save His beloved mankind. </p>

<p>I have to admit that one thing I did NOT see coming was how false Jews would be used by Satan to usher in the anti Christ.  Christians are encouraged to &quot;pray for Jerusalem&quot; bec God promises to bless those who bless Israel. This is why many Christians staunchly stand with Israel. For a long time I did not have a working understanding of the Palestinian situation and the obviously unjust methods being used by. those in power in Israel. I began to question unconditional support of israel&#39;s policies when they violated God&#39;s own laws. </p>

<p>This is also complicated because the Old Testament also prophesies about the end times (which also align with Revelation) do indicate that  1.  Jews would be scattered  throughout the world and persecuted.  (This occurred after Jesus came and died for us and rose again. Couple hundred years later, I think.) </p>

<ol>
<li> But it also prophesied that God would gather them back to their land in the last days. For those looking for &#39;signs of the times,&#39;  Israel&#39;s formation in the 1967 (?) was a huge sign. But, I have also read how elements of the nwo were instrumental in making this happen!<br/></li>
</ol>

<p>There are true Jews who worship God in spirit and in truth, but as the Catholic Church and other Christian entities --they may become infiltrated by false prophets and mislead.  So, my opinion is that malicious or misled Jews and Christians will hijack their societies in following this deceptively &#39;good&#39; leader who is really of satanic origin. </p>

<ol>
<li> The Christian antiChrist culminates his deception by sitting in the Jewish temple in Jerusalem --so maybe he will seen as the Jewish messiah.  Interesting point though --the temple is currently destroyed.  In order for this prophecy to be fulfilled, it must be rebuilt. So, keep an eye on <em>that</em> bec efforts to rebuild it are ongoing AND I&#39;ve noticed with suspicion the US intention to move US embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. (?) This is where it all comes to a head --Jesus returns to deal with the incredible blasphemy of Satan sitting in the Jewish temple --&#39;the abomination that causes desolation&#39;.<br/></li>
</ol>

<p>There is soooo much to discuss!  I am thankful for your post and have thought it should even be a sub bec there are many details that are fascinating and coming true before our eyes. </p>

<p>I have also found Biblehub.com very helpful. I love the theologian commentaries that can offer much depth of understanding of our ancient faith.  </p>

<p>The Pharisees were the Jewish leaders of Jesus&#39;s time.  In Matthew 23, Jesus calls them out as hypocrites providing examples.</p>

<p>You linked this, which covers one perspective on why Jews do not view Jesus as the messiah:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What do Christians believe about the anti-Christ?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>1 John 2:18</p>

<p>Children, it is the last hour; and just as you heard that antichrist is coming, even now many antichrists have appeared; from this we know that it is the last hour.</p>

<p>1 John 2:22</p>

<p>Who is the liar but the one who denies that Jesus is the Christ? This is the antichrist, the one who denies the Father and the Son.</p>

<p>1 John 4:1-3</p>

<p>1Beloved, do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits to see whether they are from God, because many false prophets have gone out into the world. 2By this you know the Spirit of God: every spirit that confesses that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is from God; 3and every spirit that does not confess Jesus is not from God; this is the spirit of the antichrist, of which you have heard that it is coming, and now it is already in the world.</p>

<p>2 John 1:7</p>

<p>For many deceivers have gone out into the world, those who do not acknowledge Jesus Christ as coming in the flesh. This is the deceiver and the antichrist.</p>

<p>Those are the references I found to the anti-Christ.  I am not sure if the second beast of Revelation is also a man.  His number is of a man, which I am not aware of whether that makes him a man or not.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Could it be that this anti-Christ will deceive the Jews into believing he is their messiah?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I am no expert but one could perhaps argue from the verses I posted that the anti-Christ had already come and there were already many in John&#39;s time.  I think perhaps the anti-Christ could not come until Christ had come.  I get the feeling that the anti-Christ is the spirit of Satan/Lucifer or a separate &quot;anti-Christ spirit&quot; and someone who rejects Christ is an anti-Christ because his or her spirit is Satan/Lucifer&#39;s spirit or a separate &quot;anti-Christ spirit&quot; or simply having their spirit influenced by any of these when they do so.  Based on that, Jews may all be anti-Christs already or have the spirit of the anti-Christ or have their spirit influenced by any of those.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The bible states in 2 Timothy 3:</p>

<p>This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come.</p>

<p>2 For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy,</p>

<p>3 Without natural affection, trucebreakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce, despisers of those that are good</p>

<p>Sound like anything going on today?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Absolutely.  This trend has accelerated tremendously in the past 100 years with the decline of Christianity and the rise of more selfish and materialistic behaviors.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I would argue that even if one does not worship Satan as a real being, the worship of oneself is Satanic, or, quite simply, Godless.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Agreed from a Christian perspective.  I feel that they have been influenced by Lucifer/Satan/anti-Christ or some other negative force.  If I am wrong about that oh well.  If I am right, I will have done much to save my soul forever.</p>

<p>Ever since Pizzagate, I really think pop culture has turned the Satanism up a notch.  I think they might be trying to normalize pedophilia, cannibalism, and beastiality in case something does come of it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It is also important to note that it takes a lot of time and research to understand the bible. Before, I would just believe what others told me about the bible and would isolate verses without context. Now I understand that it is not so simple. There is so much to study, and I spend a lot of my free time doing so. I learned not to take anybody&#39;s word for it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I totally agree.  I believe Catholicism from its inception and Protestantism were orchestrated by followers of Lucifer.  I keep to the source material the best I can and leave out the influence of these bodies of influence.</p>

<p>Thanks for posting this.  :)  Everything you write is very valuable to those who are unfamiliar with the subject matter.  :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This was a really well done write up, and I firmly agree with the points you are raising about some forms of satanism. I was recently looking into The Satanic Temple (TST) organization and came to the conclusion you did, while these groups claim to be about reason, rejection of religion/God, and Satan as a metaphorical figure, I began to see they are very much about the self being at the center of their world. Which is interesting, considering Satan didn&#39;t tempt Eve with worshiping him, rather with the idea of her becoming like a god. I think our society has unfortunately come to falsely equate doing what one wants with being in control of one&#39;s self (independence and identity). When really, like the examples you listed, our desires come to control us and can lead to very harmful acts. So what shall we do? Continue to examine our values and understand what is it we are losing as we become a more &#39;progressive&#39; society. Spread information like this around, and pray that we as a whole, might not fall further into confusion. </p>

<p>Just this last week, Catholics celebrated the 100 year anniversary of the Marian apparition of the Virgin of Fatima. One of the messages the Virgin Mary communicated was the final battle between God and Satan would concern marriage and family. Make of that what you will. She mentions many things involving spiritual warfare and the importance of praying for others. I encourage you to look into it if you are interested. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/fatima-visionary-predicted-final-battle-would-be-over-marriage-family-17760/">http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/fatima-visionary-predicted-final-battle-would-be-over-marriage-family-17760/</a></p>

<p>Finally, some words of encouragement, as our spiritual battle wages forward:</p>

<p>Stand therefore, having your loins girt about with truth, and having on the breastplate of justice.
And your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace.
In all things taking the shield of faith, wherewith you may be able to extinguish all the fiery darts of the wicked one.
And take unto the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Apparently the solar eclipse is supposed to signal the apocalypse beginning? All this shit that happened with the hurricanes I mean...</p>

<p>But I myself am a deist. I believe there is a universal connection to something, but it has no bearing on who we are. I think our actions and the actions of our ancestors mold who we are literally and figuratively.</p>

<p>That being said, I believe if there is a Messiah, it will be one of balance. If the human body can only exist under balance? Why are we so extreme? We are naturally attracted to extreme personalities and pick extreme sides. Why is it so hard for us to be in balance? Even our religions exist within a duality when in reality, there is nothing but spectrum.</p>

<p>I do believe ancients looked up at the stars, read it and derived meaning from it. We can look up and see stars that have died millions of years ago, if not billions, yet their light still reaches us. There&#39;s something we have not seen yet, but we will soon.</p>
