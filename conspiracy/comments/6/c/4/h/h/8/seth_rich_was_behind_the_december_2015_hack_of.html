        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>In December of 2015 The Clinton campaign was &quot;hacked&quot; when a firewall dropped between it and the Sanders campaign. The national data director for the Sanders campaign was <a href="http://heavy.com/news/2015/12/josh-uretsky-bernie-sanders-campaign-national-data-director-fired-photos-bio-age-who-improperly-accessed-clinton-data-democratic-dnc-system-access/">Josh Urestsky</a>. records showed that he was the one who helped himself to the Clinton data. He was fired immediately.</p>

<p>10 days later, Bernie Sanders makes a shocking accusation: That <a href="http://www.mediaite.com/online/sanders-adviser-suggests-staffer-that-breached-voter-data-may-have-been-dnc-plant/">Urestky was a DNC plant</a> </p>

<p>Crazy. Where would he get that idea? </p>

<p>&quot;He was reportedly recommended by the DNC’s National Data Director, <em>an individual closely involved in the voter file program</em>, and someone who had worked as the COO of NGP VAN up until a few months ago.&quot;</p>

<p>Oh okay. So he hires a Data Director on the recommendation of DNC staffers and 3 months later that guy is caught doing something dirty that makes the Sanders campaign look like crooks? Yeah I could see that. If you&#39;re Bernie Sanders that looks a hell of a lot like a setup.</p>

<p>Wait a minute....An individual closely involved with the voter file program?</p>

<p>Someone like the <a href="http://www.p2016.org/parties/dnc16.html">Voter Expansion Data Director?</a> AKA Seth Motherfucking Rich? </p>

<p>Sanders thought he was a plant when really it was the other way around. Rich lowered the firewall for 4 hours to give Uretsky a chance to swipe the files. Not only was he one of very few people who had the ability to lower the firewall (maybe the only one), he was also one of the people who recommended the guy who knew EXACTLY when that firewall would be down.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s look closer. Here&#39;s a email from the <a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/15792">Podesta files</a> about the leak.</p>

<p>&quot;On Wednesday morning, NGP VAN applied a new software patch to the DNC’s voter database system, and because of an error in the code, users were capable of accessing some limited, yet extremely valuable information belonging to other campaigns for a very brief window of time. Even though the glitch opened access, users still needed to take deliberate steps to seek out such information.&quot;</p>

<p>USERS STILL NEEDED TO TAKE DELIBERATE STEPS TO SEEK OUT SUCH INFORMATION</p>

<p>That implies that anyone looking for that info would have to know the firewall was down. That indicates cooperation between two parties. So once we knew it was Uretsky who took the files, it wouldn&#39;t be hard to trace the firewall breach back to Rich, especially since he was the one who recommended Urestsky. They were likely on to him from here out. </p>

<p>We need information on Uretsky &amp; Rich&#39;s relationship. How do they know each other?</p>

<p>Until then we need Uretsky, Amy Dacey, Andrew Brown, and Bernie Sanders in a bulletproof room until they can be questioned. </p>

<p>Rich&#39;s twitter handle was @Panda4Progress. Someone just found <a href="https://pandas4bernie2016.tumblr.com/archive">this</a> Tumbler: Pandas4Bernie2016 that stopped posting in spring of last year.</p>

<p>SETH RICH = BERNIEBRO POTENTIALLY CONFIRMED. dig into the people who liked their stuff. any connection to Rich would be huge.</p>
