        but i've already found one LIE that they re-tweeted.
       </a>
       And 100% - 1 == NOT 100%.
      </p>
      <p>
       I distinctly remember during the election even
       <a href="/r/Wikileaks">
        /r/Wikileaks
       </a>
       was like WTF is going on with their twitter..
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, yea.. the leaks maybe 100% accurate.. but, they use that image to peddle a bunch of B.S. via twitter like 'implying' Seth Rich was murdered without actually saying so (because they know it's not true).
      </p>
      <p>
       If they had proof that Seth Rich was the leaker, WHY NOT JUST FUCKING LEAK IT TOO?! The argument i've seen so far is "nobody will trust them after"... but.. cmon, if you were MURDERED for leaking, wouldn't you want Assange to tell the cops why so they could launch a proper investigation?
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Assange said, ““Whistleblowers go to significant efforts to get us material, often very significant risks. There’s a 27-year-old that works for the DNC who was shot in the back, murdered, just two weeks ago, for unknown reasons as he was walking down the street in Washington.”

        What has Assange himself said on the Rich matter? He retweeted the Fox  5 article saying Wikileaks and Seth Rich had been in contact hours after it aired

       They cannot confirm if Seth was the leaker, as it could put others in danger. There are already threads on Reddit naming other individuals who may have been working with Seth.

       It appears that there was more than 1 individual involved in leaking this info, T_D and /pol/ users have already identified others who were likely working with Seth (if he was in fact the leaker).
      </p>

       There has been a huge increase in new accounts trying to discredit this whole Seth Rich story.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most people I talk to are pretty sure that Seth Rich is the leaker. Most people I talk to are also convinced that Wikileaks was compromised back in October 2016.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for me, I try to keep an open mind. The Seth Rich story makes more sense than muh Russian Hackers. Hopefully we'll get a resolution to these narratives soon and any evidence that is being held back will be released to the public.
      </p>
      <p>
       Pretty interesting times we live in.

       why doesn't Assange just CONFIRM IT?

       he knows Seth ISN'T THE LEAKER!!!!!

       Wikileaks is held to a higher standard than other publishers... I'm sure Assange has gotten word that Rich was murdered for political reasons... but without any evidence he can't come right out and claim it... Cause if he did... everyone would say "Prove it!" and without a leaked files or two to back up his claims he couldn't prove it.

       Seth Rich was (according to the theory) the leaker. That means he leaked it to Assange. So Assange has the evidence. (he doesn't).

       I dunno if Rich leaked to Wikileaks... but if he did... Assange would never admit it... he still calls Chelsea Manning an "alleged source" and we all know she leaked to Wikileaks... if you paid any attention you'd know how well Wikileaks protects it's sources... its like one of their core beliefs.

       Not really, for the reasons I previously outlined for you already. If he did prove it,

       Well there's an alternate theory regarding Seth Rich.  He's not the leaker.  But he
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       involved in framing up the Sanders campaign over the data-access snafu during the election.  He'd have been murdered to cover their tracks, which would mean they'd not want the public to be scrutinizing the murder for whatever reason, even a false one.

       Here's an old account saying that the Rich story does not hold up the way people here are absolutely sure that it does.
      </p>
      <p>
       In my view anyway. Even the people involved don't say anything to back up the idea that he was the leaker. Most of the commentary here starts from the premise that Rich was the leak, then jumps into how awful John Podesta is and the other claptrap.
      </p>
      <p>
       And if we're talking about suspicious accounts (sigh), what about the inflow from t_d posting Seth Rich stories and old Clinton dirt?

       This is the only solid bit of evidence that I think helps the idea that he was the leaker.

       Wikileaks have a $20,000 reward for anyone who can help resolve the Seth Rich case. Assange also brought this up in an interview related to the sources of the DNC leak.

      <p>
       The reasoning for this though then falls entirely into the realm of speculation.

       and what about the reductive nature to that line of reasoning. I find it lacking in realism, because if that was the goal all they would need to do that is just say "Seth Rich is the source."

       But libel cases are near impossible to win in the United States, unless you are Hulk Hogan. I don't think this is correct.
      </p>
      <p>
       Further to the point, how would anyone prove he wasn't the source to allow them to win the libel case. There are also a lot of first amendment protections for journalists.

       Do you think Julian Assange released all the emails that he had? He claimed to have them all, and yet we only say a selective amount of emails, where were the emails of the DNC folks going out of their way to help Bernie, where are the emails of the DNC staff gossiping and shitting on the stupid shit Clinton did and said? If you have worked in any sort of work environment like that, you would be foolish to believe 100% into Assange's narrative.

       Or maybe Assange didn't get many emails about Sanders because the DNC knew he was a non-issue and wasn't gonna make it past the primaries... a forgone conclusion... they don't sweat Sanders cause he ain't going to be a threat.

       Really, you are telling me there was not one email between Sanders staff and the DNC that showed the DNC helping the Sanders team? Really? You are telling me the DNC didn't notify the Sanders team about getting more debates scheduled? Really?

       No, I am just reading what he has claimed and knowing that he is only releasing material (which is accurate mind you) that helps his narrative. Julian Assange is not a fan of leaks and information that does not fit his narrative, i.e. his response to the Panama Papers. If that was the 3rd largest law firm in the world doing that, makes you wonder what the largest 2 are doing, and everyone in the top 10, top 50, and etc.

       Wikileaks doesn't reveal sources. Would destroy their info stream and vetting process.

       Wikileaks wouldn't have evidence Seth Rich was killed for leaking. Someone would have to leak that and I highly doubt there would be any paper trail someone could leak. They know Seth was the leak and Seth was murdered. Offering $20k for info that leads to murderer is the most we should expect.

       No "but...", the leaks are all that matter, and they've been 100% accurate over 10 years across millions of documents. They're so good at what they do, they've also picked up numerous awards along the way from around the globe including "TIME Magazine Person of the Year, People’s Choice (highest global vote)" in 2010.

       It appears that there was more than 1 individual involved in leaking this info, T_D and /pol/ users have already identified others who were likely working with Seth (if he was in fact the leaker).
