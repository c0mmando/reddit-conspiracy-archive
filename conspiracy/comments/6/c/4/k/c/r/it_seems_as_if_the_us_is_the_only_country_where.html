    <div class="md"><p>I agree with what you&#39;re say but I also think it&#39;s the fact that propaganda teaches you war is fun and you&#39;ll bring freedom to America when that not the case. Instead when they get to boot camp theyre constantly yelled at and broken down to be rebuild back up to take orders also to obey. Then after the boot camp brian wash they go to the fleet being super motivated to bring democracy to other country and freedom to America. Instead they constantly get hazed for being a boot and have to deal with alot of stress. Finally they get sent to the middleeast so excited to go to war in till they take someone life and having friends die. They also have to leave the middleeast and back to their mundane military life dealing with bullshit and PTSD. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hahaha not at all. Man/woman joins military normally at a pretty young age 18-21 with a very limited reality on what society in U.S.A. is. Man/woman learns in Military that its not bad to like your country and that people of multiple lifestyles/races/religions can get along very well and in fact makes better friends than they&#39;ve ever experienced in their previous life. </p>

<p>Man/woman leaves Military more optimistic on life than ever before and gets shot in the back of the head by reality when they see how whiney, fake, boring, segregated the world really is. </p>

<p>Being in the military sucked b/c freedom. But the people you interact with are the best. It is the example form of a Utopia you&#39;ll probably ever find.</p>

<p>Being out of the military sucks b/c everyone you meet you just want to punch in the face and say be happy. Civilians cry about life 24/7 and stuffs not that bad. </p>

<p>Why am I out of the Military now? I enjoy my freedom and I have dogs to replace people. Im doing alright.</p>

<p>In other countries, Isreal, Greece, yada yada / one must serve hte army (Mandatory) --- yet this IMPROVES the person. They become methodical, respectful, organized, etc ,etc.. those armies empower their people with useful training and education.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Same in South Korea, they become ever more indoctrinated because service is mandatory and inevitable. Even people who can&#39;t serve due to health is ridiculed for it. I only did four years in the Navy but the ones I saw snapped, it wasn&#39;t because they were mentally weak. I think it was the indoctrination being rejected by their subconscious. Of course I saw a few who WERE mentally weak and couldn&#39;t cut it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well how often do these two armies actually experience extreme combat war? For instance, the IDF has top notch assault weaponry and the upper hand in the region.

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s because they&#39;re taking young kids that don&#39;t understand the true morality of the world and turning them into monsters. These kids when they go in aren&#39;t aware that they have the mental capacity to take someone&#39;s life. They get put into a situation where they&#39;re literally murdering someone with a gun that has never personally done them any harm, and the military brainwashes them so badly that in their heads- they aren&#39;t able to distinguish between feeling good or bad about it.</p>

<p>Pair that with the knowledge they receive when they get home- that all these wars, all this conflict.. only benefits a very small group of bankers and corporations- and you now have a crazy person that just slaughtered innocent people for literally no reason. It becomes difficult to distinguish between your preconceived notions of what a serial killer does in the United States and what you just did in the Middle East. There isn&#39;t much of a difference.</p>

They make sure all your shots are up to date... gotta get special shots before you get deployed due to [some disease] so here&#39;s another injection you need, soldier.<br/>

    <div class="md"><p>Precisely. That&#39;s how they see it.<br/>
History has <strong>proven</strong> that governments (Japan, Germany, France, blah blah) will experiment if they can justify a need to.<br/>

<p>With the history they have, and the alliances with VERY nasty beings they have, it&#39;s a fair assumption that the still are.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Last year there was a post in r/science that said a veteran proved in court via medical records that the malaria medicine used by the military damages the brain, creating symptoms similar to PTSD. The theory is vets have actual brain damage that is being diagnosed as a mental illness. I am on my phone now, but tonight i&#39;ll look for the link.  </p>
