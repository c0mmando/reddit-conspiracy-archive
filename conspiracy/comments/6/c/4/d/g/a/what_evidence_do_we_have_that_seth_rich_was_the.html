    <div class="md"><p>Seth was a Bernie Bro. Big part of DNC leaks is Bernie getting shafted.</p>

<p>I haven&#39;t fleshed this out yet but it could be connected to Comey also.   A few weeks ago DNC was in the news for arguing they have legal right to rig their primaries. Between then and Comey firing that PI story about FBI having Seth&#39;s laptop would have been circulating for vetting. Comey fired 5/9 and PI story comes out 05/15 and is quickly and suspiciously denied and retracted by everyone.  Very very odd in my opinion. Possible Trump was getting sick of Comey obstructing Clinton and DNC related investigations... And now Wiener ready to plead guilty all of a sudden.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This idea is almost as bad as the people saying the other day that &quot;Even if it turns out Seth was the leaker, he probably was hired by the Russians and they killed him to cover up their tracks.&quot;</p>

<p>I am sorry, but this is just too out there even for me. The Republicans murdered him to create a scandal? I could see politicians doing that, but it would make zero sense in the context of the timing and when things went hot.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Think through it ...</p>

<p>Republicans have a history of claiming that anyone who dies around Democrats was killed. The Seth situation fits this exactly.</p>

<p>Republicans fill the internet with FAKE conspiracies to crowd out and deny real ones (although sometimes they are right, but only where it benefits their partisan cause).</p>

<p>Republicans would know that seeding the internet with another HRC &quot;murder&quot; would be an effective partisan strategy.</p>

<p>We see exactly that happening -- the internet is full of Seth rich, and it pops up in grand style every time there is a current Republican scandal.</p>

<p>I am not saying that Republicans killed Seth. I am simply saying that -- given the lack of evidence (both that he would have such information and that Democrats would kill him)  and the political effect, and given the history -- it makes MORE sense that Republicans <em>would</em> do it than Democrats.</p>

<p>Point being: the Seth Rich conspiracy is total nonsense.</p>

<p>Agree now? :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He had access to the emails.</p>

<p>The circumstances of his death were sketchy; it certainly wasn&#39;t a robbery, which is the official story.</p>

<p>Podesta emailed that he wouldn&#39;t mind making an example of a leaker. </p>

<p>People speculate that the Clinton&#39;s have a high body count, though that&#39;s a whole separate series of theories really.</p>

<p>But the true cherry on top is Assange&#39;s tweets about Rich, and offering a bounty for info on his murder. While it&#39;s against policy for him to say that Rich was the leaker, Assange has certainly been hinting at it exactly how he would if it were true. </p>

<p>And btw - what evidence do you see that he isn&#39;t the leaker? The reports from his family (who certainly don&#39;t know the truth either, nor do they claim to, contrary to how some have reported their statements). The claims that Russians hacked the emails instead? We, the public, have no direct evidence to support that claim, just the word of other anonymous people - just like the anonymous FBI agent that Fox supposedly tapped for this story. </p>

<p>The truth is, neither side of the public knows. But there&#39;s a LOT of partisans on both sides who act like this case is already decided, and that the other side is clearly being dishonest. Those are the real liars in this story - those who pretend like the truth is already known. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just because your IT is not great, doesn&#39;t mean you don&#39;t also have a disgruntled employee working for you. The DNC had bad IT, but most places have bad IT... it&#39;s not like the DNC was unique in being bad, it was just bad enough that it wouldn&#39;t be that hard to hack, which is dumb for a political organization that a lot might be interested in attacking.</p>

<p>However, considering Seth Rich&#39;s Reddit account and Twitter account was discovered yesterday, it turns out he was a huge Bernie Bro. Considering he worked with the very DNC that was colluding against Bernie, it doesn&#39;t seem all that unreasonable that a Bernie Bro might be upset about that, or try to leak that information out. In fact, remember when that IT flaw happened that gave access to Bernie&#39;s campaign lots of stuff at the DNC? There was lots of talk about how such a thing doesn&#39;t just happen on accident like that, like it likely was done purposefully.</p>

<p>Lots of conspiracies floated around how maybe the DNC did it on purpose as a way to set Bernie up. Others speculated that it was a DNC insider doing it to help. In reality, we don&#39;t know, it&#39;s all speculation, just as it is with Seth Rich.</p>

<p>We&#39;ll see, but considering Seth Rich absolutely had access to that kind of information, as you would in his position and his skill-set that he was hired on for the DNC, both in data analysis and app development, he 100% would have had access to the server and would have known to get the stuff.</p>

<p>It&#39;s definitely still just circumstantial, but it&#39;s a hell of a strong circumstantial case considering Assange himself has been tweeting about Seth Rich long before the conspiracies ever piled on, just shortly after his death. No one suspected anything about Seth Rich after he died. It wasn&#39;t instant conspiracy.</p>

<p>There was another DNC staffer and campaign member of Bernie&#39;s team that was shot and killed during the campaign. No one ever said anything or thought anything of that. It was a big tragedy. But no, Seth Rich is killed and instantly the FBI do a forensic analysis of his hardware and the DC police quickly settle on it is a &quot;Robbery gone bad even though nothing was stolen&quot; and there was no curiosity if that conclusion was accurate? Really? That was just &quot;Ok, you&#39;re right, just a robbery gone bad... nothing to see here, move along!&quot;</p>

<p>There are just so many little things here and there that are just &quot;off&quot; about it all, and that is why it has turned into a conspiracy. We don&#39;t know.</p>

<p>Also, I should say, there is evidence the DNC was breached by multiple people, not just some Russian hacking group. It absolutely can be a disgruntled DNC employee who had access AND the Russians. I mean hell, Russia, just like the US and China, constantly are trying to hack everyone, from political organizations to large businesses. Anything that can be of good use to them. I bet the Russians and the Chinese have been trying to hack the DNC and the GOP for years and years, probably successfully.  Though, the FBI did say that they found attempted hacks on the RNC but they had better security so they never got through, as far as they know.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;ve got a fair point there; however, security breaches like this are often not traditional &quot;hacks&quot; as we&#39;d think of them, but instead are more like knowing someone else&#39;s password in your office because they leave it written on a sticky note on their desk.

<p>I&#39;d like to see what evidence exists of him NOT being the leaker. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure.  The leaker had to hack the server.  Seth Rich didn&#39;t have access to email chains he wasn&#39;t a part of.  Seth Rich has no hacking experience (that I know of) while Russia (and other super powers) have engaged in hacking as a form of espionage.   </p>

<p>Seth Rich had virtually no motive.  He was a Democrat.  A massive Obama supporter, loved Bernie and worked for Hillary.  He might be bitter at the DNC, but he also had financial interest in Hillary winning the election.  IF he had a motive, it would be a stretch.  Russia on the other hand?  They have interests in lifting sanctions (which they were able to discuss with Michael Flynn), they have interests in a government that will choose to veer away from old Obama policies.  Russia has a clear motive.   </p>

<p>The FBI confirmed they identified the agents responsible for the hack.  Something Jeff Sessions has yet to recant.   </p>

<p>Julian Assange admitted that his source for the leaks could have been a third party acting on behalf of a state.   </p>

<p>The Trump-led DOJ has yet to even acknowledge Seth Rich.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No. If he had access to the mail server, he could take any folders he wanted.</p>

<p>Doesn&#39;t sound like their security was any good at all, so it&#39;s not hard to believe.  Bad passwords, bathroom servers, no understanding of what a phishing attack looks like, etc.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;ve got a fair point there; however, security breaches like this are often not traditional &quot;hacks&quot; as we&#39;d think of them, but instead are more like knowing someone else&#39;s password in your office because they leave it written on a sticky note on their desk. And from my recollection, that was possible where he worked.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just because your IT is not great, doesn&#39;t mean you don&#39;t also have a disgruntled employee working for you. The DNC had bad IT, but most places have bad IT... it&#39;s not like the DNC was unique in being bad, it was just bad enough that it wouldn&#39;t be that hard to hack, which is dumb for a political organization that a lot might be interested in attacking.</p>

<p>However, considering Seth Rich&#39;s Reddit account and Twitter account was discovered yesterday, it turns out he was a huge Bernie Bro. Considering he worked with the very DNC that was colluding against Bernie, it doesn&#39;t seem all that unreasonable that a Bernie Bro might be upset about that, or try to leak that information out. In fact, remember when that IT flaw happened that gave access to Bernie&#39;s campaign lots of stuff at the DNC? There was lots of talk about how such a thing doesn&#39;t just happen on accident like that, like it likely was done purposefully.</p>

<p>Lots of conspiracies floated around how maybe the DNC did it on purpose as a way to set Bernie up. Others speculated that it was a DNC insider doing it to help. In reality, we don&#39;t know, it&#39;s all speculation, just as it is with Seth Rich.</p>

<p>We&#39;ll see, but considering Seth Rich absolutely had access to that kind of information, as you would in his position and his skill-set that he was hired on for the DNC, both in data analysis and app development, he 100% would have had access to the server and would have known to get the stuff.</p>

<p>It&#39;s definitely still just circumstantial, but it&#39;s a hell of a strong circumstantial case considering Assange himself has been tweeting about Seth Rich long before the conspiracies ever piled on, just shortly after his death. No one suspected anything about Seth Rich after he died. It wasn&#39;t instant conspiracy.</p>

<p>There was another DNC staffer and campaign member of Bernie&#39;s team that was shot and killed during the campaign. No one ever said anything or thought anything of that. It was a big tragedy. But no, Seth Rich is killed and instantly the FBI do a forensic analysis of his hardware and the DC police quickly settle on it is a &quot;Robbery gone bad even though nothing was stolen&quot; and there was no curiosity if that conclusion was accurate? Really? That was just &quot;Ok, you&#39;re right, just a robbery gone bad... nothing to see here, move along!&quot;</p>

<p>There are just so many little things here and there that are just &quot;off&quot; about it all, and that is why it has turned into a conspiracy. We don&#39;t know.</p>

<p>Also, I should say, there is evidence the DNC was breached by multiple people, not just some Russian hacking group. It absolutely can be a disgruntled DNC employee who had access AND the Russians. I mean hell, Russia, just like the US and China, constantly are trying to hack everyone, from political organizations to large businesses. Anything that can be of good use to them. I bet the Russians and the Chinese have been trying to hack the DNC and the GOP for years and years, probably successfully.  Though, the FBI did say that they found attempted hacks on the RNC but they had better security so they never got through, as far as they know.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How do we know anyway?</p>

<p>But if you&#39;ve ever worked in IT, you would know the people right passwords down and stick them on post it notes under the keyboards are in the top desk drawer or whatever. Do you need any official access.</p>

<p>The thing is I&#39;m not even arguing that he&#39;s necessarily the leaker, just that it&#39;s quite plausible.</p>
