       What is the difference between Obama and Kennedy when both of them pushed for heavier socialist systems and less oppression for the people including the civil rights movement?

       That seems odd, perhaps you should do more reading on JFK...

       I respect them for different reasons- Kennedy for making the last attempt to rid America from subjugation at the hands of Federal Reserve.
He was ambitious and ballsy and got himself killed for it. Washington for his part in ensuring the revolution was successful. Have you read
       <a href="https://archive.org/details/HowTheNationWasWonAmericasUntoldStory1630-1754">
        How the Nation was Won?
       </a>
       Washingtons role as an accomplished spymaster  and instigator of the psyop for members of the revolution to be inducted as Freemasons, is little discussed. Again, ambition and balls. You'll be noticing a trend at this point..
      </p>
      <p>
       Fully cognisant of their other shortcomings. Just judging them by different criteria.
      </p>
      <p>
       Obama is a personal one. He was meant to be a lot of things for a lot of people, but from personal experience (Nigerian/American) nobody was more disappointed in his 8year fraudfest than black people. My family legit thought he was the messiah, I was slightly more skeptical but still very much in the sauce. But like Barry's promises, the goodwill soon evaporated, as well it should have. Obamas on the list for the masterful way he managed to suck people back into the bs, at a time when it felt like genuine change was possible.

       Last I checked, Obama was not the president of Black people. I think that is where a lot of our own people have it wrong. His path was chosen to create a shield for what is coming next, nothing more nothing less. He is the reason why there was a gap between Bush and what was supposed to happen next had any of the Neocons actually seemed human and won the election.
      </p>
      <p>
       He gave the east 8 years to surpass USA to launch a counter for what is about to happen (WW3/The USA government turning on it's citizens).
      </p>
      <p>
       Remember, his purpose was not to give pookie and jasper trillions of dollars, it was to set a standard against the people who've ruled this world by pushing for open media via the internet with his contacts at Google, acknowledging the racial differences and systematic racism, spreading awareness of oppression in poor countries like Iran/Vietnam/.
      </p>
      <p>
       This country was done for when it killed JFK, instead of taking the same outward approach, he simply did it behind the scenes. The people who rule the world have set forth their own destruction as it was written long ago. There is nothing we can do to change that. What Obama could change was giving the perfect example of what to conduct yourself like and endorsing the correct people to give those with a soul something to grab on to for what is coming ahead.
      </p>
      <p>
       His first term was a bunch of coon dancing, but by the second, his real side began to show. He did not suck people
       <em>
        back
       </em>
       into the BS, he brought it to the forefront. You see, they were going to do this because they wanted to do this, not because Obama was in office but because the people who control the world are wicked and that's all they know. This government was ALWAYS GOING TO TURN ON IT'S CITIZENS.
      </p>
      <p>
       Until you realize what Dan did for the world, you will never understand why Bernie was knocked out of the race, why Trump got elected, why Russia was given Syria with minimal conflict from the US, why the formation of black politics grew larger than it has ever been, why whites are even outraged at the government, how
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       first gained it's roots via the Reddit, why Google took over Youtube to allow this content to all be pushed, why Alex Jones stepped on the scene as soon as Obama did, why there is so much conflict surrounded by one man.
      </p>
      <p>
       When you see the war for it's truth, then you will understand. Obama was the first real president of the United States for a long time. Unlike JFK, they could not kill him because this country would have already been in flames. He did not destroy America, he was the middle man given a dying America (mere months after election, housing bubble bursts) and attempted to
       <em>
        heal
       </em>
       America and make it the way it was supposed to function. That right there began the start of America showing it's true colors. He gave back to the poor, not just BLACKS but to ALL AMERICANS, he increase spending in the civil sector, He taxed the rich credit card companies who would call and bully us for money, he pushed for police to have cameras so that they would do their job right, he opened up the federal sector and investigated from the inside, HE TOLD YOU TO GET OFF YOUR ASS AND PROTEST AGAINST THE SYSTEM, he did everything he was supposed to do and yet, you people cannot see it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fraud? No. The most transparent president ever, so damn transparent that he pushed for protesting against his own administration. There is nothing left for him to do as I said before, America already sowed it roots long ago, there is nothing left for us to do. He did his job which was be the middle man and allow Russia to have Syria. Doesn't seem like it will do anything no? But it will, because the people who truly run this country need Syria and in order to get it, they will have to fight a Russian to Iran axis to do so.

       His lifelong mentor was Zgbinew Brzezinski, of "I created Al Qaeda" fame, working as Carter's foreign secretary, enacting the will of the Council on Foreign Relations. Aka the American establishment. You thought he was legit? Did you ever wonder why he bailed out the banks for their reckless thievery ? Why didn't a single senior banker see any jail time? Ermmm maybe because they own him. Well, them and the CIA I guess.

I'll tell you what. Go and write a post telling the sub how legit Obama is. Let's see what kind of traction it gets. Aren't you keen to see how accurate your perception is? I am.
But I don't think you will. Because behind the (unwarranted) bravado, you surely know everything you're saying is bs.

       My post history dates back years, always has been the same concept. I understand that majority of the world will not see it yet.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nowhere in your entire post did you ever actually say anything though. You see this is how the conspiracy realm has been plagued by "boogie man" tactics. You keep talking about the CIA, okay what does that mean though? CFR?!? What does it mean though!? He's the President of the United States, he's going to have a touch on pretty much everything.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's put some things into perspective since you are so well rounded in
       <em>
        knowledge
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       (A) Obama started programs like the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act also known as the CFPB. This program was created in order to take money from the greedy wealthy and give it back to needy poor.
      </p>
      <p>
       (B) Trump destroyed this act as soon as he got into office.
      </p>
      <p>
       (A) Obama vetoed US intervention in Syria over 50 times
      </p>
      <p>
       (B) Trump has pushed, and is pushing for any way into Syria.
      </p>
      <p>
       (A) Obama said it's okay to protest the system
      </p>
      <p>
       (B) Trump not only hates protesting but is pushing for harder laws for protesters including one that enables RICO like sentences
      </p>
      <p>
       (A) Obama wanted less prisons in our country, going as far as even getting non violent offenders out of jail,
       <strong>
        even pushing privatized prisons to the point they wanted to sue
       </strong>
       the country because they were not being fed bodies.
      </p>
      <p>
       (B) Soon after trump was elected, prisons stocks jumped through the roof.
      </p>
      <p>
       (A) Obama basically called Israel out time and time again and had a mutal hatred for Netanyahu to the point the Israeli Prime Minister was brought to America to give a speech
       <strong>
        OVER THE PRESIDENTS
       </strong>
       HEAD which featured weeping Republicans.
      </p>
      <p>
       (B) Trump has bent over backwards for both Saudi Arabia and Israel to the point that it is almost not even American at this point.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now I am only presenting some of these things because I'm about to mention something that for some reason your brain wants to look over.
      </p>
      <p>
       Who is (A) Obama working for and who is (B)Trump working for?
      </p>
      <p>
       To put it into deeper perspective, you said that because Obama had CIA connections, that certainly deemed him as working with the powers that be but that doesn't make sense.
      </p>
      <p>
       From both the provided differences,
       <strong>
        these two men cannot work for the same group of people.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       This is how your theory looks to someone who is following the story correctly:
      </p>
      <p>
       *Hey make it harder for us in our global conquest, give Syria to Russia and time for all of Russia's allies to get their economy and military together. Also, make sure you give more powers to minorities in our oppressive countries so that it's extra hard for us because they will gain a sense of self as a group. In fact, piss off the Blacks, Latinos, Native Americans oh and don't forget the Muslims so that they get extra mad at us as a collective group. Make sure that you give Iran a path to stronger weapons too that will really help us! Oh and promote taxing the rich! We need to be taxed!
      </p>
      <p>
       Then turn around and put Donald Trump in office and just undue the last 8 years by continuing the same ideas, principles and methods of normal white supremacy ideas within America? Stomping on smaller countries to show power by throwing The MOAB and shit around?
      </p>
      <p>
       Your theory begins to fall apart at that moment and the only thought I have left is what the hell is that guy talking about?

       Worst goes to Woodrow Wilson and one of the Bush's, easily.  One sold us out to international bankers for a century and counting.  The other one (two) ushered in the new era of fascism and tyranny.
      </p>
      <p>
       Runner ups are Harry Truman and LBJ.  Assassinating a president pales in comparison to nuking two civilian cities, though.  God damn.  Just thinking about Truman makes me sick to my stomach.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can't think of a clear-cut favorite, though.  It would be Andrew Jackson, for openly fighting off the bankers, but it sucks that he was also a racist, murdering asshole...  And then Kennedy, for de-escalating another global meltdown, at Cuba.

       Best Washington. Worst Jefferson. Second worst Lincoln. Second best I'll gamble on Trump, still a chance his presidency results in the whole motherfucker being burnt to the ground, which we've needed since Lincoln at a minimum, arguably since Jefferson.

       Washington was first and by all accounts set an imperfect but very strong example to follow. Adams was a dolt so we'll ignore him. Jefferson basically decided fuck the constitution when it's inconvenient and pretty much everyone since followed suit. Lincoln waged a war against sovereign States for no reason other than to preserve the bastardized version of the Union Jefferson started and Trump is currently our only and best hope to get shit so fucked up that it collapses and we get to start over with a dozen or so new Washington's that will probably make a few whiskey rebellion type mistakes but at least they'll know and should respect how fucked up things can get when too much power is given to too few people.

        George Washington was broadly sympathetic to the Federalist program.
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       You are correct in that he was not a member of the Federalist Party, but he was definitely a federalist philosophically. I think his aversion to partisan politics/factions led him to abstain from declaring a party. Picking Hamilton to head the Department of the Treasury is another signal that he was a federalist.

      <p>
       Then there's the
       <a href="http://www.mountvernon.org/digital-encyclopedia/article/federalist-papers/">
        Federalist Papers
       </a>
       ...
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        George Washington was sent draft versions of the first seven essays on November 18, 1787 by James Madison, who revealed to Washington that he was one of the anonymous writers. Washington agreed to secretly transmit the drafts to his in-law David Stuart in Richmond, Virginia so the essays could be more widely published and distributed. Washington explained in a letter to David Humphreys that the ratification of the Constitution would depend heavily "on literary abilities, &amp; the recommendation of it by good pens," and his efforts to proliferate the Federalist Papers reflected this feeling.
       </p>
       <p>
        Washington was skeptical of Constitutional opponents, known as Anti-Federalists, believing that they were either misguided or seeking personal gain. He believed strongly in the goals of the Constitution and saw The Federalist Papers and similar publications as crucial to the process of bolstering support for its ratification.
