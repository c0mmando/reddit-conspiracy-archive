       I live right near here so when the weird itinerary pops up in the news every once in awhile... I started to notice that there was always a Pizza Hut mentioned... The joke writes itself. Q: Why did they come all the way up here for one night then right back to Boston. A: That must be some damn good pizza.
      </p>
      <p>
       These few articles talk about how the FBI was keeping people all hush hush... the first one is just a nbc article for a little mainstream media flair... the next 2 are Portland Press Herald... local paper up here... not some tabloid thing. After that a couple sites that showed up in google... they seem to try to dissect the situation but I can't vouch for how credible they are.

       "Financial records and bank video show Atta and Al-Omari made two ATM withdrawals in Portland, and the men were reportedly spotted at an area Wal-Mart, as well as in the parking lot of a
       <strong>
        Pizza Hut
       </strong>

      <p>
       After checking into the hotel, Atta and Alomari were seen or photographed at four businesses in South Portland:
       <strong>
        Pizza Hut,
       </strong>
       a KeyBank drive-up ATM machine, an ATM machine at an
       <strong>
        Uno Pizzeria &amp; Grill,
       </strong>
       and at the Jetport gas station.

       Forum post that says locals said

        "hijackers involved in the Sept. 11 attacks found a pattern in their orders for pizza."
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Bonus fun - Saw an old forum post about a paperboy from my town that remembered seeing the guys the morning of 9/11/01 with a huge pile of suitcases... They told the newspaper about it... then rescinded when the FBI showed up. I went to see what he's up to now... fuckin' running for senate.

       Nope... Seems like everything they purchased and their ATM withdrawals were all kept pretty hush-hush after the FBI got up to Maine... I'd like to see if I could find the old newspaper article from Dr. Larry Ponemon... he was up to some sort of analysis of their purchases... but I don't have a lot of context as to the extent of the "pizza code".

       Devil's advocate as someone from Maine: at the time of 9/11, pizza would have basically been the only palatable food at the time.  No, I'm not really exaggerating.  Pizza and chain food (McDonald's, KFC, Taco Bell).  To the point where I'd give less weight to there being some deeper meaning on code.

       I'm from Maine too... I know Portland didn't have the foodie scene back in 2001 and that it has now... but I have a feeling Pizza Hut and Pizzeria UNO aren't hallal... but there seems to be a lot of conflict about exactly how "muslim" Atta was... seemed to like booze and strippers a bit too much to be truly devout.
      </p>
      <p>
       Still confusing though... why even come to Maine at all? They were in Boston on 9/10... drove up to Maine that night for pizza and boxcuttters and then flew right back to Boston early the next morning... almost missed their flight... they could have just stayed in Boston and scored Pizza Hut. Why endanger the operation with a quick roadtrip to Portland and back?

       I know.  You know, what
       <em>

       always been confused about was... Maine was like +98% white back then.  How was that supposed to be low profile?

       I have to presume it was to be in an area of lower surveillance, but that wE always odd.  I
       <em>

       find the pizza part odd.  Even if you're going by "halal", there's still ways to eat pizza without pepperoni.  Just doesn't taste as well.

       One theory I heard was that Atta didn't actually die on 9/11... he bounced off to somewhere else... and wasn't involved in the execution of the plan.
      </p>
      <p>
       They why the came up to Maine... to make sure they stuck out extremely well... make sure they were spotted buying boxcutters and remembered later... same reason they made sure the luggage didn't make it on the flight... to leave behind an orgy of evidence... including his will... which would have been pointless to bring on the flight... unless it was printed on the same jetfuel-proof paper the other guy's passport was made out of... so it could be found in the streets beneath the WTC.

       Yeah... I looked into Halal after posting... the dietary restrictions are pretty loose... I assumed it was something akin to being Kosher... Kosher restrictions super complicated and weird... halal is more like... "no pork or booze".

       The thing about pizza places is that it's easy to launder money through them. A lot of cash flows through them but is more expensive than, say, Taco Bell. It wouldn't be hard to cook the books (or bake, as it were) and bring in 1000s a day in cash without looking suspect.

       Your previous comment made it seem as though you were insinuating MadCowProd was responsible for the suitcases of cocaine/heroin, not that the information related to the insinuation could be garnered from the site.

       Never forget that the Republicans were in charge during that time, and Georgey Senior coined the term 'New World Order'. You remember the Republican Party? That's the one Trump represents and who own all sectors of government thanks to many people here.
      </p>
      <p>
       You want to make ridiculous leaps to connect the Partisan Pizzagate theory with 9/11 and the Democrats, then NEVER FORGET it was the Republcians pulling all the strings.

       How about this sub wakes up now and look at what Trump is doing in Saudi Arabia, instead of this stupid fucking pizza shop theory.

       Slow your roll there, buddy... no one here aside from some loony partisan is saying anything about pizzagate... and he's getting downvotes. Why is it every single time guys like you see the word pizza they think it has something to do with pizzagate. You sound pretty obsessed to me... Sometimes I wonder what goes on inside of heads like yours... ya think they wanted their 72 virgins ahead of time so they just swing by the ol' Pizza Hut? Daaaaaaamn son.

       It's okay if ya are one of those "pizzagate" dudes... I know how you guys can get... but try not to instantly link everything you see with the word pizza in it to "pizzagate"... cause they might need to up yer meds if thats how your brain works... We're talking about 9/11 here.
