       And that is a shame since this 2016 election and aftermath has been deep state vs. the people.

       There is a powerful political movement at the center that straddles both parties.  The old left/right paradigm is being broken up by 'the third way' aka centrism.    The center can keep us extra divided.  Hillary and Paul Wolfowitz are not that far apart and basically the same in foreign policy.  Anyone more liberal/conservative than they are is considered to be fringe.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now there are masses of voters at the fringes.  If you want universal health care for instance, they are going to rig the primary so the only major party two candidates are against it.  And if you vote third party you are a loon.  Do you know what i am saying?

       Propaganda is a powerful thing. It's so fucking frustrating. But I've found that slowly and subtlety introducing people to ideas like the deep state is more effective than telling them a lot of at once. Making them realize it for themselves, rather than shoving it down their throat.

       I really cannot wrap my head around how someone can see "anonymous intelligence officials" leaking compromising information about the president and his administration on a regular basis and still sincerely believe that there's no such thing as a "deep state". Like, what would prove it, the Director of National Intelligence holding a press conference and telling the world "the deep state exists and opposes the presidency of Donald Trump"?
