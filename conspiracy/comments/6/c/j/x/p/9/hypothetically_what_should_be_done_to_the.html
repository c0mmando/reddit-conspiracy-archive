Obviously we are past that kind of draconian punishment in human development.  But I think there has to be some sort of punishment.  This is literally like being an ignorant nazi follower in 1930&#39;s Germany.  The harm and gas lighting  they are unknowingly causing (again assuming PG/SR is real) is insane.</p>

<p>And before anyone brings it up, I&#39;m not discounting trump/Russia though I certainly believe it must be put on the back burner till these issues are actually addressed.  And addressed by WaPo and pals doesn&#39;t count.  What y&#39;all think?</p>

<p>But dont you think SOME of the enablers are really just &quot;passionate sheep&quot; for a lack of better word? Where do you draw the line anyway-other than ppl who would knowingly be manipulating the agenda.  Like a passionate dupe who does PR for shareblue and is ignorant to the &quot;hypothetical truth&quot; of this situation could do just as much damage as a reporter lying through their teeth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I guess it would depend on how far the &quot;passionate sheep&quot; go. Did they destroy someone to inadvertently protect someone guilty who they thought was innocent? Are they genuinely regretful?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is no better than Bill Nye suggesting that climate change deniers should be jailed. Someone that would even suggest such a thing is truly a sick individual, and a clear and present danger to liberty.</p>

<p>At times, a tolerant society must become intolerant against the intolerance that threatens it, in order to protect itself. Therefore, it seems appropriate that someone who would suggest punishment for ones beliefs must themselves be punished for threatening the liberty and due process of others. - Me, 2017</p>

<p>It&#39;s nice that you suggest PG/SR deniers should be punished. Very informed about history you are. But what if the deniers should be proven correct? Should we then apply the same standard and punish you?</p>

<p>Be careful what you ask for. The standard you set may one day find you being burnt at the stake.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree everyone has different thresholds for evidence.  But when a rational person sees evidence that they don&#39;t personally agree with, but notice that many others DO agree with it, they don&#39;t call them retards or crazy ppl.  They say &quot;idk about that but hey you might get be right&quot;.  For example, I don&#39;t think Trump and Russia are up to anything nefarious, but I doubt by call my friends who think that names or question their intelligence.</p>

<p>Also, I&#39;m flattered, but I am no tyrant.  I have no power over anyone but myself and do t wish to have power over anyone else.  Tyrants are pretty notorious for not asking other ppls opinions, which is all I&#39;m doing here.</p>
