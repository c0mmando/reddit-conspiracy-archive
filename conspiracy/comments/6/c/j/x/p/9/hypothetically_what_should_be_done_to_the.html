       I jokingly said in a post where /pol/ had been noting some antifa ppl that they'd be brought to concentration camps.  Obviously we are past that kind of draconian punishment in human development.  But I think there has to be some sort of punishment.  This is literally like being an ignorant nazi follower in 1930's Germany.  The harm and gas lighting  they are unknowingly causing (again assuming PG/SR is real) is insane.
      </p>
      <p>
       And before anyone brings it up, I'm not discounting trump/Russia though I certainly believe it must be put on the back burner till these issues are actually addressed.  And addressed by WaPo and pals doesn't count.  What y'all think?

       I think it'd be fair to make them all get "pedo/murder apologists" tattooed on their foreheads then call it even

       No, everyone is entitled to their opinion man I'm talking hypothetically if these things are ever proven to be true.  It's like what was happening in Europe when some ppl were saying "hitler is killing all the Jews indiscriminately" but everyone else was saying "no way you all are crazy idiots".
If more ppl would've listened to those ppl, certainly a lot more ppl especially Jews could have gotten out of Eastern/central Europe, right?

       Right now it certainly does come down to opinion and how willing you are to look at evidence when ppl decide how legit these theories are.  But what if there is a real threat of them being true but NEVER getting out because nobody listened?

       Def enablers.  For example my parents both work 50 hours a week and would have no reason to know about this stuff.  Don't use the web but for facebook. I'd love for them to be tattoo free.
      </p>
      <p>
       But dont you think SOME of the enablers are really just "passionate sheep" for a lack of better word? Where do you draw the line anyway-other than ppl who would knowingly be manipulating the agenda.  Like a passionate dupe who does PR for shareblue and is ignorant to the "hypothetical truth" of this situation could do just as much damage as a reporter lying through their teeth.

       I guess it would depend on how far the "passionate sheep" go. Did they destroy someone to inadvertently protect someone guilty who they thought was innocent? Are they genuinely regretful?

      <p>
       These are tough questions and gray areas, and issues that I very much hope we get to deal with some day as David Brock is walked to the gallows.

       This is no better than Bill Nye suggesting that climate change deniers should be jailed. Someone that would even suggest such a thing is truly a sick individual, and a clear and present danger to liberty.
      </p>
      <p>
       At times, a tolerant society must become intolerant against the intolerance that threatens it, in order to protect itself. Therefore, it seems appropriate that someone who would suggest punishment for ones beliefs must themselves be punished for threatening the liberty and due process of others. - Me, 2017
      </p>
      <p>
       It's nice that you suggest PG/SR deniers should be punished. Very informed about history you are. But what if the deniers should be proven correct? Should we then apply the same standard and punish you?
      </p>
      <p>
       Be careful what you ask for. The standard you set may one day find you being burnt at the stake.

       No, because I'm not denying that they could be fake theories.  Hence the hypothetical.  I'm not trying to be overly self righteous.  I'll admit I am an idiot, though I don't think it's very cool of you to call me a sick individual.  Or bill nye honestly, I mean I don't like him but he's not a sick individual.  Cmon man you do not have to be like that.

       Anyone who would suggest punishing someone based on their beliefs, or even denial of facts, is a tyrant.
      </p>
      <p>
       People have varying levels of what they will accept as proof or evidence. To punish someone because their personal level has yet to be reached is nonsense.

       I agree everyone has different thresholds for evidence.  But when a rational person sees evidence that they don't personally agree with, but notice that many others DO agree with it, they don't call them retards or crazy ppl.  They say "idk about that but hey you might get be right".  For example, I don't think Trump and Russia are up to anything nefarious, but I doubt by call my friends who think that names or question their intelligence.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, I'm flattered, but I am no tyrant.  I have no power over anyone but myself and do t wish to have power over anyone else.  Tyrants are pretty notorious for not asking other ppls opinions, which is all I'm doing here.

       Look through any post here about pg/sr.  So many comments of ppl saying "omg this sub is trump conspiracy retards" then they patronize the slight possibility that a dead man was killed for nefarious reasons or trying to leak us infornation that would save our sovereignty.  Patronizing the idea of a pedo ring in Washington is just as ludicrous in my opinion just based on the research I've done( again I'm willing to admit I could be wrong on this, I doubt not pretend to know it as fact)

       Finally, if my hyperbole impedes liberty then how do you feel about Americans having the liberty to expose attacks on their sovereignty or having the liberty to not get molested as a child just because they were foster kids?  Again this is all hypothetical, I don't believe these theories but I have entertained them enough to think there's a chance.

       "Burnt at the stake" was simply a reference to the witch trials of Europe where 10's of thousands of people were murdered because they were different in some way, whether it be beliefs, opinions, habits, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       The point I was making was that today you might be advocating for punishing someone based on a belief and find yourself a victim of that very same standard. Which is exactly what happened during the witch trials in many cases. Hence the burning at the stake reference.

       Gotcha, still though the metaphorical equivalent wouldn't be if I was making accusations of ppl being witches, it would just be me conjecturing "what do we do if they actually are witches"?
      </p>
      <p>
       I think based on our previous comments we can both agree that conjecture thought and speech are all necessarily protected liberties, right?
