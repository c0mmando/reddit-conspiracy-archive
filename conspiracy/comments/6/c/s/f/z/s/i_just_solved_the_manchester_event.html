        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>WHAT: It was state-sponsored terrorism.</p>

<p>WHO CARRIED IT OUT: Who knows, but they got their paychecks from the same people behind Boston, Paris, Dallas, London, Florida, Berlin, Denver, Sandy Hook, Times Square, Nice, San José, etc., etc.</p>

<p>MOTIVE: To keep all of us afraid to be alive, especially in public spaces. To keep us afraid of both lone-nuts and terrorist groups.</p>

<p>IF STATE-SPONSORED, WAS IT A FALSE FLAG OR A HOAX?: It doesn’t matter, see below.</p>

<p>SEONDARY MOTIVE: To keep r/conspiracy and /pol/ busy. We already have all the conflicting reports, all the initial videos/pix and will have all the subsequent videos/pix for us to analyze, check the metadata for clues, consider the initial sources and search their post histories, spend time commenting or posting our own analyses…. ad nauseum.</p>

<p>[Disclaimer: I found myself doing this very thing for 5 minutes and decided to post this instead]</p>

<p>One can find hours and hours of video on YouTube about many of these similar past events. Think of the time it took for the researchers to make them; think of the time it took for us to sort through them with our desire to know what was happening. We all came to similar conclusions. Great. What good has it done?</p>

<p>Don’t even fucking look at this event. It only affected those who were there and were killed or injured – and those who loved them. It did not affect the vast majority of us, and we need to keep our cognitive and creative focus on the issues that are affecting us, because they have the same root as all the random bombings and public shootings. </p>

<p>We can’t take our eyes off of money and children, first. The current windows we have into that around Seth Rich, media collusion, dumbass “Satanists” in power, inciting war/conflict with Russia, etc. should still be the focus on the “New” and “Hot” tabs if we’re worth a shit. </p>

<p>Let the fuckers have this one, because they obviously want us to take the bone and waste our energies getting to the bottom of it. We already know where it leads.</p>

<p>Thanks for listening.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>For some reason, Ariana Grande came to my thoughts as I was driving around this evening, before I heard about all this. I had been watching a vid on the &quot;illuminati influence&quot; in music and Hollywood, and remembered a video she did for Vice, dressed in bunny ears and leotard, with someone commenting on this sub that it was a demonstration of her commitment to her &quot;career&quot; with them. </p>

<p>Then, the recent post about how celebs likeher + Miley Cyrus,  Selena Gomez, et. al. are introduced as role models for girls, then sexed-up and objectified in their music careers later. </p>

<p>Your comment just made me think of those other ways that the shit creeps into suburbia.</p>

<p>Had to google him , am not English.  Is he any different than Labour&#39;s own Tony Blair ? </p>

<p>One of the supreme satanic leaders of the world, responsible together with JWB for destroying country of Iraq and bombing Serbia. Thus providing drug resources for CIA funding.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No. He is completely different. </p>

<p>Where as Blair was basically centre ground. Corbyn is left wing. He is principled. Campaigned against his own party (Blair) war in Iraq, wants to tax the richest and corporations to pay for the cuts in services by this centre-right Tory government. </p>

<p>He was arrested as a youth for protesting against apartheid and he said that Tony Blair should face war crimes. This is our Bernie Sanders moment. </p>

<p>The election is June 8th. By June 9th we may have a radical progressive who is not scared of the right wing media or the corruption. </p>

<p>The guy divorced his wife because he fundamentally opposes private schools and she wanted to send their son to one. That is how principled he is. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Corbyn I agree is principled and genuine, saw vid of him talking to hospital staff for 10 mins and he seemed natural and caring. But the Labour Party is in dire shape and most want Corbyn to leave if he loses despite him saying he&#39;s going to carry on no matter the result. Most people can&#39;t bring themselves to vote for Corbyn, he&#39;s probably going to fade into the background like Bernie.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Most Labour Party want Corbyn. It is the minority who do not want him. He has had two leaderships votes. Comfortably won the first and gained even more support in the second. </p>

Corbyn may be principled of sorts but he surrounds himself with traitors and people here still remember the IRA terror like it was yesterday.

    <div class="md"><p>Which of the following seems more likely?</p>

<ol>
<li><p>No one was recording at all during the explosion... then the explosion happens... extreme panic... &quot;Oh snap! I should record this instead of focusing on my safe exit&quot;...then a handful of videos surface online (one with an American accent telling everyone that there are no problems)</p></li>
<li><p>People recording before the explosion... explosion occurs ... people leave their phones recording while in a panic... Post a day or two later after shock has left their minds and bodies.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>My point is that in the case of an explosion at a major artist concert in Europe, there would be more video evidence online. The Orlando Pulse coverage was almost as in depth as this. </p>

<p>Someone is censoring the hell out of these videos.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Its blantantly obvious now that they realize human beings are gaining a collectove consciousness. Whenever an attack happens suddenly thousands if not millions are collectively combining their consciousness to focus on this or that event. Its one thing to have sheeple all collectively serving the master spirit, but when they all begin waking up and realizing we are all connected by our realization of existence, they must dostract or divide us subconsciously. </p>

<p>The effects of hypnosis on the masses to vibrate at lower fear consciousness is a common tool. Thats why they remind you to never forget Paris or 9/11. As long as we vibrate at a fear level, we can be controlled. Religion was the best way, fear of God. but that&#39;s not going to work forever. We have a destiny to vibrate at higher consciousness, some would say heaven would be the highest level, but whatever it is, it isnt this. Not Trump, not concert bombings and ISIS. </p>

<p>They used Ariana too (Illuminati, blood sacrifice?) for this very purpose. If you research her history, you&#39;ll see alot of concerning information about her, including satanic rituals she&#39;s admitted to performing. </p>

<p>This is all to keep billions of people under control. The best thing to do for humanity would be to vibrate at as high a frequency of consciousness, focused on love and light, collectively. There would be an instant change in the vibration elsewhere, almost like a domino effect of waves. We all vibrate on too much fear as it is, on racism, on hatred of police, each other, suicides, bombings, missiles, all fear based. Its all being flooded at us to constantly keep us distracted, confused and afraid.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I get the general impulse of your post, and largely agree, but I think I have to disagree at least in principle with this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We can’t take our eyes off of money and children, first. The current windows we have into that around Seth Rich, media collusion, dumbass “Satanists” in power, inciting war/conflict with Russia, etc. should still be the focus on the “New” and “Hot” tabs if we’re worth a shit.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Maybe particularly the Seth Rich angle. Now I believe that there&#39;s something to that story. It looks like an assassination, and it looks like it was made to look like an assassination (this is an important difference). But at this point, we don&#39;t have any publicly available information to definitively say <em>who</em> assassinated him, and whether there is in fact a coverup. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying not to keep digging—we absolutely should—and KDC might come out with something substantial tomorrow (though I&#39;m not holding my breath.) My point is that we need to at least consider the idea that Seth Rich might be being used as a distraction in its own right currently. You think &quot;they&quot; wouldn&#39;t be capable and willing of doing that?</p>

<p>If Seth Rich amounts to more than a series of very suspicious coincidences, it will be because uncovering the truth about his life and death lead to bigger fish. I really see it the same as Manchester; it might have this kind of value if it can uncover truth about bigger fish. </p>

<p>That&#39;s why in general I&#39;m not a huge fan of the &quot;don&#39;t look there, look here&quot; sentiment. Let people look into what they want to look into. If the Seth Rich story has legs, it will still have legs tomorrow, and a week from now. </p>

<p>Provided they abide by the rules, I fail to see why they are not welcome.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Conspiracy theory and conspiracy fact. See the terms of reference in the sidebar.</p>

<p>&quot;The US Government spies on its citizens.&quot;</p>

<p>Prior to the leaks by Edward Snowden, among others, the above words were conspiracy theory and the rantings of a &#39;paranoid nut&#39;. Today, these are the words of &#39;critical thinkers&#39;.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t discount the OPs post as this being a distraction from other events; not to diminish the suffering of those killed or harmed in this event, but the acknowledgment that there are much bigger things going on in the world than those in Manchester (let alone of more importance than our posts here on some website).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>People like you are the reason why majority of people laugh at any conspiracy argument thrown at them.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They have been laughing since 1967, they are welcome to continue to do so in their (sometimes envied) ignorance. No skin off my back, or put another way by another ridiculed sub: &quot;I Don&#39;t Give A Fuck&quot;.</p>

<p>Honestly, why should we care what others think about us?</p>

<p>If your sense of self worth is measured by the value placed from others then perhaps you should take a step back and build some self worth within yourself. Same reason why that sub I alluded to a moment ago mentions men take up weight lifting (track-able progress and sense of achievement boost self esteem and reduce depression/anxiety).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>When you spend countless hours investigating and collecting data, then present well structured arguments backed up with evidence, you may claim you attempted solving something.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not all posts on this sub claim to attempt to resolve anything.</p>

<p>Sure the OP went a little over the top for dramatic effect but it does not diminish the aims of his post. It certainly got people talking, given the emotive tone of your own post.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Untill then, fuck off.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But then who would come here with other little pieces of the puzzle to contribute to the larger picture?</p>

<p>Sometimes even the most insignificant thing turns out to lead to some of the most powerful conspiracies. Discouraging others on the chance such posts appear here diminishes the value of this sub.</p>
