    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s 4:30 PM, Tuesday in New Zealand right now, and it looks like Kim Dotcom might not be saying anything on Tuesday (also when I looked at the responses to his Manchester tweet they seemed split between urging him to go ahead with the disclosure, or urging him wait a bit so that MSM can&#39;t use Manchester to ignore what he has to say), so you do kinda have to wonder...</p>
