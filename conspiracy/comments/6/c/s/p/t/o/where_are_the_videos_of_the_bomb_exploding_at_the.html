       I've been to hundreds of concerts, and one thing that is a constant is that there are people  ALWAYS recording. Especially kids at an Ariana Grande concert. When you have that many people in one building for a concert, at any given moment there will be tens if not hundreds or even thousands of people recording at once. The bigger the show/crowd/venue, the more smartphones taking pictures or recording. There should be tons of footage of the bomb exploding, but so far all I have seen is footage supposedly after the explosion. There should be Facebook live feeds, Snapchat videos, and even just videos saved to the persons camera roll on their phone that they would upload later. There should be plenty of videos from all angles and seating locations. But I haven't seen anything. What gives?
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: bomb went off after the concert while people were exiting, and not during the concert in the main floor area. Therefore I wouldn't expect fans to be recording while they leave a concert. But there should be plenty of security video footage, haven't seen any yet though.

       People care way more about their safety than sharing videos during an emergency.  Also, there seem to have been a lot of young people there.  Young people usually have private accounts.  I'd imagine investigators have a bunch of video feeds rolling in.  I'm sure clips will be come out over the next few days.  Not sure I will have any desire to watch those though.  Scary stuff.

       Because you can't get a bomb into the event so they waited til it was over and people were walking out in huge crowds.

       So a truck bomb only took out ~19 people? Where was this explosive? I also heard security was quite lack during this event... Why? Remember Timothy McVeigh supposedly took out ~160+ people in OKC with a truck/outside bomb....

       Although this is the summary of events, I do agree that an IED (from what I've seen elsewhere) would have caused more damage than what we have seen or there lack of. The bomb was detonated in the lobby (speculation) as the concert ended and people were leaving.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just an observation, of those injured I can see that it's mainly the lower half of legs to the front of the body, could be nothing but just seems strange.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nevertheless, this was a tragic event and we cannot live in fear as this will show that terrorism is winning.
      </p>
      <p>
       SN: The security at events such as these are pretty tight and don't take any shit, it was at the end of the night and they wanted to get everyone out so it wasn't as prevalent as it was.

       It wasn't exactly outside, it was in the foyer. I explained the layout of the Arena in another thread, (I have worked on lots of arenas providing security throughout the country) the arena in which the concert takes place is let's say a large oval shape , around the large oval shape is an outer ring running all around it , this is the foyer were the bomb was said to have taken place. The foyer is technically I side the venue, but not in the arena. Apparently the bomber was in the foyer attempting to get through to the main arena, he was unsuccessful I assume with it being 15 minutes towards the end of the concert they weren't allowing people that had left the main arena back in, this is standard procedure, because of this the bomber set off the bomb in the foyer, the foyer has a high roof and is quite wide which means any dage wouldn't be seen from the outside . I am quite suprised there was no footage of the actual explosion, but having said that most videos were taken upon leaving the arena, I wouldn't of thought anybody would be standing in the foyer with their phone out and recording at the precise time of the explosion.  Any that may of would've probably been too close and would've most likely lost there lives. I have always had concerns about the security at the Manchester Arena, I live close to Manchester the arena isn't very far not only have I worked the security but I have also been at the venue many many times spectating concertd and have a considerable amount to of knowledge of the venue layout and security procedures.
      </p>
      <p>
       One thing I can say is over the years to present day the security has been very poor, the majority of people do not get searched, and barely any bags get searched, the odd person now and again may be asked to open the top of their bag , but this is only now and again. No walk through metal detectors, no pat down searche's and no metal wand searching.

       There is footage of the arena emptying, with a loud bang followed by screams. That's all we've seen so far. The screams were horrifying.

       When I first posted this I was unaware that the bomb actually went off after the concert ended, while people were exiting, and not during the concert in the main floor area. Therefore I wouldn't expect fans to be recording while they leave a concert.
However, there should be plenty of security video footage, but I haven't seen any yet though. Who knows if any will get released, or if some does get released, if they will edit or censor it by only releasing certain footage and not all of it.
