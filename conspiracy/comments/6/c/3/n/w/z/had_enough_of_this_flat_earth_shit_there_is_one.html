    <div class="md"><p>How would that stop newtons 1st law?  objects will remain in their state of motion unless a force acts to change the motion.</p>

<p>Losing a force thats continually pulling you down should mean that it speeds up upon reaching zero g.  And dontnforget there isbt a magical threshold to breach to get into zero g.  Its gradual based on distance from the object pulling on you.</p>

<p>Good job just spouting nonsnense wihtout research tho.  Really helpful.   Just livin up to your wonderful name im sure.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Mach is a plenty fine term when speaking of speed, its is a multiple of the speed of sound (761mph @ sea level)</p>

<p>I looked up the speed of this &quot;tiny rocket&quot; as you keep calling it and it weighted 724lbs at launch, 435lbs of its weight was propellant. It was 21ft tall, 10 inches diameter, and it reacheds speeds as high as 3580MPH or MACH 4.6</p>

<p>I dont care what your material is, if it is light weight cardboard or solid titanium, if something slams into a semi dense material at mach 4.6 it will cause significant damage.</p>

<p>This rocket was likely a composite (carbon fiber/fiberglass) and aluminum construction with ceramic components for the hot end.</p>

<p>in the video you can not see immediate stoppage, just sudden stop in rotation, and decrease in acceleration. This rocket did hit space, however it did not have enough velocity to escape earths gravity well, or enough vertical velocity to orbit. </p>

<p>once you accelerate something from 0 to 3580mph and stop accelerating its going to slow down even in &quot;space&quot; so close to earth due to air friction/resistance.</p>

<p>you are tagged as well, and correctly so.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mean, just think about this for one or two seconds...</p>

<p>If there were a dome and this rocket just &quot;hit the dome,&quot; what would happen next?</p>

<p>One possibility is the weakest point in the structure will collapse, causing the rocket to be destroyed. It would hardly be difficult to imagine this. The video subtext claims the rocket reached an altitude of 76 miles. The video is 2:00 long (and doesn&#39;t begin directly at launch, so using the 2:00 time to calculate speed is conservative). That means the rocket is traveling at an average of 2000 miles per hour, if we assume that the altitude it achieved was limited by the &quot;dome,&quot; as is the implication here. Does it make sense that an amateur rocket built of cheaply rated materials hitting a solid dome going 2000 miles an hour will survive the impact?</p>

<p>Let&#39;s say it did survive the impact. If you read the following explanation of &quot;center of pressure&quot; of a rocket, you&#39;ll note that it would be physically impossible for the rocket to maintain an orientation perpendicular to the surface of the alleged &quot;dome&quot; after coming into contact with it, if the engines are still providing propulsive force. It would collapse against the dome, and possibly change trajectory towards a path away from the dome. If this happened, you&#39;d see the surface of the dome very clearly in the video and you&#39;d have no argument from me whatsoever that an impact with a solid surface occurred.</p>

<p>Unfortunately for you, this is just an extremely silly example of the flat earth ruse, a decades old joke that for whatever reason, people are either taking seriously now, or simply acting as if they are more serious than they in fact are.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t have to. I&#39;m absolutely certain the earth is round and that the heliocentric theory is the only plausible explanation for what we observe in the heavens. This is backed up by literally thousands of years of astronomical observation and research. It&#39;s also confirmed by data and born out in the thousands and thousands of physical principals based on that understanding of the universe. In short, there is certainly plethora of evidence for the accepted model of the universe, therefore, a model which contradicts this one cannot be accurate, and until you are able to evidence the theory you propose, or even evidence that the accepted model is incorrect, with actual evidence instead of just speculation, you are just a LARPy bullshitter polluting this sub with nonsense.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why do you spend so much time pushing BS while ignoring easily verifiable facts?</p>

<p>I mean you can&#39;t claim to just be interested in the truth if you ignore what can easily be observed. </p>

<p>You can&#39;t claim to really care, since proving the earth is flat would be incredibly easy if it was true and you won&#39;t do it.  Just make a documentary of your trip to the end of the earth.   That is literally all you&#39;d have to do, and if you are proven correct you&#39;d be rich and famous.</p>

<p>Since you won&#39;t do that, what are you really spending the time for?   Anyone who care&#39;s can prove the world is round, so it&#39;s not an argument you can ever win.  Why waste your time on it?</p>

<p>You&#39;d be better off proving that alcohol and opiates are perfectly safe to take together.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why are you so determined to inhibit conspiracy discussion on a conspiracy sub? If you had spent some time researching you would know that there is no way to prove the Earth is a sphere unless you are TPTB. We have plenty of proof now showing that ISS feeds are cgi/greenscreen/harness/parapolicflight/underwater to give the illusion of weightlessness. Why are you so vehemently in support of the official narrative? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m all for discussing real conspiracies, but this isn&#39;t one.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you had spent some time researching you would know that there is no way to prove the Earth is a sphere unless you are TPTB.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Anyone can prove it&#39;s a sphere, you can fly a plane both east and west and either way end up in the same place. That alone proves that it&#39;s not flat, and people do this all the time.  You can also make your own weather balloon with a camera on it and take pictures of the curvature of the earth yourself.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why are you so vehemently in support of the official narrative?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Who exactly is controlling this narrative?   If it was false it would be easy enough to prove.  You haven&#39;t explained or defined exactly what the TPTB specifically is, or how they can prevent basic empirical observation.</p>

<p>People figured out not only that the world was round, but it&#39;s size simply by using math and measuring the shadows of two obelisks in two cities before we even had the tech to fly.</p>

<p>Discussing conspiracies are pointless if you just decide facts, math, physics don&#39;t matter.  Not to mention you personally refusing to verify the easily verifiable is not just the result of TPTB.  It&#39;s you signaling the fact that you personally don&#39;t care about the very thing you spend so much time on.</p>

<p>So again I ask, why bother wasting your time on something you clearly don&#39;t care about?  Are you just part of an organized effort to water down conspiracy discussions?</p>

I don&#39;t understand, other than shilling or blind faith, how anyone can believe with all their heart, mind, and soul that the Earth is flat, round, pear-shaped, donut-shaped etc.<br/>
This has got to be one of the top three conspiracies that should be proven 1000% but so many are positive it&#39;s round without seeing the shape themselves.<br/>
Insanity.<br/>
You simply can&#39;t just say &quot;I&#39;ve seen a curved horizon, all the planets and moons are round, NASA says so, Carl Sagan says so, Bill Nye and Neil Degrasse Tyson say so, there&#39;s live feeds, etc.&quot;  That is not good enough.  </p>

<p>There are really great humans who have healthy relationships with families and friends, who have a typical 9-5, etc. that are not &quot;retarded&quot; but are truly curious about the true nature of the shape of the Earth. What comes with this curiosity is why would all of these different organizations and outlets lie to the world about the shape?<br/>
But no, what do us who are curious about this subject get instead? Condescension by those who feel superior because of the years of round Earth propaganda fed since they were children.<br/>
There can be discussions about remote controlled jetliners, aliens, multiverses, dark matter, reincarnation, remote viewing, hidden technology hidden in Antartica, HAARP, etc, but Yah forbid we talk about just the thought, the possibility that the Earth may not be round. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Where&#39;s the rest of the video?  The video ends like 5 seconds after the rocket &quot;stops&quot; but with the exception of the beginning of the launch you can&#39;t really judge any movement of the rocket going up using a short 5 second window.  Go ahead and try it by going back 5 seconds before it stops (like where the countdown starts).  How discernible is the rockets upward trajectory in those five seconds?  Now go back ten seconds from the start of the countdown and there still isn&#39;t much noticeable upward movement.</p>

<p>Give me a video that&#39;s like half a minute longer.  You should be able to judge that the rocket has moved further from earth in that time, and if it hasn&#39;t, I&#39;ll admit that this rocket stopped.</p>

<p>Then we need to work on what awesome material the dome is that makes a flimsy rocket able to got from like 2000 mph to zero instantaneously without damaging it, at all.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think he meant to imply he had evidence.    But as for the idea of water being outside the dome..</p>

<p>6And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters.
7And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were under the firmament <strong>from the waters which were above the firmament</strong>: and it was so.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So, you don&#39;t believe in the dome but now you are telling us what it&#39;s composed of?<br/>
Sorry, but you don&#39;t get to do that.  No one who even believes knows what it&#39;s composed of.<br/>
If the dome is there, standard physics and such are out the window so we can&#39;t say it would explode or whatever.  </p>

<p>This is well known, spin in your chair with your arms and feet inward, then move your feet/arms outward. Very simple concept once you realize it.</p>

<p>God spoke: “Sky! In the middle of the waters; separate water from water!” God made sky. He separated the water under sky from the water above sky. And there it was: he named sky the Heavens; It was evening, it was morning— Day Two.
Genesis 1:6‭-‬8 MSG</p>
