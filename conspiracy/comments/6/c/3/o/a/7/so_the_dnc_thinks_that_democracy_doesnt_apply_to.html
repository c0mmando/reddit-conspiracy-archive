    <div class="md"><p>Well technically they are correct. People seem to forget that the DNC and the RNC are private organizations. Yes, they&#39;re political organizations but private nonetheless.</p>

<p>If they wanted to, they could just choose a candidate through internal discussion and decision making, and it would be completely legal. That&#39;s because the government has absolutely nothing to do with the party organizations themselves. There&#39;s no connection.</p>

<p>Truth of the matter is this. The only reason we have primaries prior to the general election is so that the parties can gauge the level of support for their candidates and that they can put forth the candidate of their team most likely to win.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, but the same logic does apply to other parties as well, not just the dems and the republicans. It&#39;s just right now, they&#39;re the two at the top of the food chain.</p>

<p>I do agree though, that the government should not be giving resources, in any form, to political organizations.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So I&#39;m guessing you believe that Bernie would have won if not for some vague action on their part, is that right?</p>

<p>Legally, they aren&#39;t obligated to hold primaries. It&#39;s not an admission that Bernie got cheated. </p>

<p>The thing is there&#39;s an implication that they will remain impartial throughout the process, that&#39;s actually the whole point of the primary... to express the view of the party</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Therein lies the problem. YOU are not the party, or even remotely close to being a part of it. Just because someone registers as a Democrat or a Republican does not mean they are part of the political organization itself.</p>

<p>Did you think George Carlin was just telling a joke when he said</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It&#39;s a big club, and you ain&#39;t in it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The fact that there&#39;s an implication of impartiality, when in reality it&#39;s not there, is our own fault. It is our lack of knowledge of how party politics works in America that is to blame. But that is a hard thing us to accept because it requires us to take responsibility.</p>

<p>I never said it was ok. What I said was that the DNC&#39;s statement that they can &quot;pick a candidate behind closed doors in a smoked filled room if they wanted to&quot; is technically correct. And legal.</p>

<p>You never asked for my opinion of what I thought about it. But since you assumed my opinion on it, let me correct the record.</p>

<p>I think it&#39;s a bullshit system. On both the DNC and RNC side. Problem is, there&#39;s not really anything we can do to fundamentally change it. And we do not want the government coming in and telling a party how to choose it&#39;s own candidates either. That would be akin to the government choosing our President for us. Which would defeat the whole purpose of an election. Additionally, any laws or rules placed on political parties concerning how they govern themselves, I think, is a huge overreach of government and a gross violation of freedom of speech.</p>

<p>So that leaves this. What CAN we do about it? Be more informed about party politics. Recognize that the primary processes of our leading parties is not a democratic one. Leave our current party for one that better suits us. Start a new party.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well the general election is on the up and up, and completely democratic in it&#39;s design. It&#39;s the process that gets us there that really screws things up and, in my opinion, strips the people of their voice.</p>

<p>Only we can change the state of affairs when it comes to party politics in America, but that requires that we the people take responsibility. Sadly, despite how much people bitch about it, they would rather let things be than do that.</p>

<p>Private organization have fiduciary duties towards their members and are subject to laws. More so if those private organizations rely on public infrastructure to operate...like the voting system.   </p>

<p>The DNC is committing political suicide. If it wins it admits that  the primaries are a deception. If it looses it will be found guilty of fraud.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>impartiality clause? Here&#39;s the problem though. There&#39;s no legal backing to it. It&#39;s their own rules and they are expected to be the enforcer of their own rules.
