<p>The one thing that makes me doubt that is how many internal alarms were going off. And I am also a part of a church, and I know what the fundys are like, and they seemed way more strange. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay, then, that definitely makes me think JWs. I&#39;m not trying to dismiss your concern, but Jws are super strange! JWs are more than fundies; they&#39;re in a high mind control cult that literally dictates and controls every single aspect of their lives. They&#39;re not allowed to socialize with people outside the cult, so they tend to be isolated, unsocialized weirdos. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve actually heard your exact story (people initially thinking JWs at their door were spooks, ICE, undercover detectives, casing the joint, etc). Jws freak a lot of people out because of how they dress, act and how aggressive they are on other people&#39;s turfs. If you&#39;re still worried, pop into one of their local kingdom halls, and you&#39;ll probably realize that the people you ran into are carbon copies of the people inside. Wish you well, hope you figure it out. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not all JWs are weird, at least in my country. Persuasive maybe, but they are so accustomed to being rejected that they&#39;ll take the hint instantly. The JWs that I sometimes see doing rounds at my area are super nice old ladies with a fun sense of humor, and all JWs I know of also dress in normal everyday clothes too. They don&#39;t pester me anymore (they do say hi and give me the magazines as I actually read them for fun) because I told them my brother and his wife are JWs and I&#39;m extremely familiar with their &quot;thing&quot; and need to lecturing.</p>

<p>They could have been casing out the house, as my neighbors have been robbed during the same time of day. Also, if they really were spooks then maybe me? And me not being in the house and in my car ready to drive away was to sketchy for their original plan? </p>

<p>Yea, I feel ya. He was such a weird/interesting looking figure, I couldn&#39;t help it. It&#39;s like if a description of a spy in a dan brown novel came to life and was staring at me from six feet away. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Correct me if I&#39;m mistaken but don&#39;t church people usually come in pairs not in threes?  don&#39;t they usually wait for you to come out of the car in order to talk to you? And dont they usually try to give you the pamphlet regardless of the level of your interest? Definitely sketchy. And the fact that they drove all the way to the last house slowly, makes me think they were hoping you&#39;d drive into one of the earlier houses  and leave them alone and when they seen you enter behind them they were like fuck it let&#39;s just give him/her our church cover so he/she won&#39;t call the police to report suspicious behaviour. </p>
