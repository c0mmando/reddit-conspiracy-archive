        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;ve been bouncing around online since the late 80&#39;s, and conspiracies ruled the BBS&#39;s back then.  One thing that had persisted throughout my time online was the definition of globalism. 
 This seems to have changed slightly over the last couple of years, and I&#39;m looking for some clarification.</p>

<p>The conspiracy definition of &quot;globalism&quot; that I&#39;m used to is a single world government run by either a cabal of wealthy elite, satan, a single dictator, or... all three.  A globalist is someone that works to create a single world government.  They may, or may not, have a sinister agenda. (for the record, I agree that this would be bad)</p>

<p>Lately I&#39;ve seen people using globalism to describe trade agreements, diplomacy with foreign countries, and general government functions.  Globalist has been turned into anyone that favors free trade, travel, and general liberty.  I&#39;ve seen anarchists on both the left and right labeled a globalist, as well as libertarians, moderate republicans, democrats, and liberals.  Basically anyone that may not support Trump&#39;s protectionist economic plans and immigration policy. (for the record, I don&#39;t necessarily think this is bad)</p>

<p>To be clear, I understand the layman term for globalism is free trade etc., but I keep seeing people use it as a derogatory statement - as if the person is a shadowy figure that wants a single world government.  Like they&#39;re blending the two definitions together.</p>

<p>If you made it this far into the post, could you help me out and define globalism and globalist?  It would help me understand the base concerns of some of the people I encounter online.  Thanks!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hell yea! The content was drastically different that what is around today. Web pages weren&#39;t really a thing, at least not in the way they are today. You were somewhat restricted to within your service provider&#39;s network and via their particular software. So something like sending an email required both you and the other person to have the same service provider. Think of it like using Yahoo, and ONLY Yahoo. Not for searching for something, but in terms of using the features that Yahoo has; news, shopping, email, bulletin boards, etc. Now take away pretty much all of the GUI and make pretty much everything text based. It looked like <a href="http://imgur.com/aGhS6C7">this.</a> Everything was set for navigating without a mouse, since it was common to not have a mouse.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If I may chime in on your conversation, I believe the globalist agenda is to establish a foothold in as many places as possible, creating a dependency through actions such as trade deals or military interventions. IE: Carrot vs. Stick </p>

<p>That&#39;s exactly what it is. The &quot;globalism will lead to a one world government&quot; bullshit is right-wing propaganda that mainly had roots in religious nutjobs.</p>

<p>The Wikipedia page on globalism has good info on this.</p>

<p>They love to use flowery terms that mean the opposite of what they&#39;re​ planning.</p>

<p>We know that real bi-lateral free trade deals, negotiated by a government that has their people&#39;s best interests at heart is good. But phony &quot;free trade&quot; deals like TPP are not good.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, <em>I&#39;m</em> not.  I&#39;m using laymans terms.  I don&#39;t know how you guys are defining your terms, or how much you know about free trade.  When I say &quot;free trade&quot; to people they generally think of NAFTA and TPP.  Those same people generally think NAFTA and TPP are free trade in the way we define it.  </p>

<p>In other words, the general population seems to be ok with our free trade (real free trade), but don&#39;t know that NAFTA and TPP are government interference in the market.  I was starting with the general definitions, then drill down once a conversation starts.  Like now.</p>

<p>While I don&#39;t agree that NAFTA and TPP are free trade, I do think they are a better alternative to protectionist trade policies and trade wars.  When I criticize protectionism I&#39;m labeled a globalist (in the derogatory sense).  This is why I&#39;m here.</p>

<p>Do you understand that there are people that are pro-free trade that want zero interference in trade by government?  When they say free trade, they mean free trade.  It&#39;s literally a cornerstone for libertarian philosophy.  Many political groups don&#39;t define government trade agreements as free trade, it&#39;s interference in the market.  Do you include these people with globalists?</p>
