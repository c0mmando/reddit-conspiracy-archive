       I was reading the other day that a number of local Boston schools have elevated levels of lead in the drinking water. It's ridiculous that we can't even get people clean water yet can afford to bomb the shit out of the third world.

       The previous administration of  "elitist warmongers" managed to survive without cutting $800 billion from Medicaid.  I'm not sure how you can argue that it doesn't matter who is in charge, when clearly it does.

       It is my opinion that both parties are employed to serve the same agenda. A simple way of explaining it is both parties work against the interest of the people but use different strategies and rhetoric. Who was the last president who's actions promoted peace? The interests of the people are served by neither party, and yet they are presented as our only choices. Our democracy has been subverted by the interests of a greedy self serving elite.

       The government is pledged to keeping its citizen's safe. It isn't doing that here and is instead using money for made up enemies (ie - laundering it). There is certainly a conspiracy among the rich here.

       trump isnt the president of flint, or michigan as a whole so why are apparently holding him responsible for a problem the local gov caused and should fix?

       do i personally think the fed gov should step in, probably yes they should, but it is not really the role of the fed gov to fix every issue at the city or state level.

       Wrong. Trump is - unfortunately - the president of every resident in every city in the U.S. So if nothing is being done or said to fix the problem, the blame falls on him.

       How fucking deluded can you be. If Trump doesn't want to ensure the safety of every single AMERICAN in the United States then he shouldn't have ran for president.
      </p>
      <p>
       But it's obvious caring for our citizens wasn't his top priority. He's a business man. He doesn't give a fuck about you. He doesn't give a fuck about me. He doesn't give a fuck about the citizens of Flint.

       i feel he cares more about me than the last president did.  more than hillary or bernie did.  both of them just wanted to take more of what i earn to spend on others. same with obama.  i hardly see how that is "caring for me" either, so what can ya do?

       and again, WHAT HAPPENED IN FLINT IS NOT THE PRESIDENTS FAULT AND NOT HIS PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY TO FIX.  thats not how it works, thats not how any of this works.

       Trump has the power to make progress in this situation if he gave half a fuck about the people like he tirelessly claimed to during his campaign.  Turns out he would rather be kissing rings of Netenyahu and Saudi kings, and playing golf, than working for his own people.

       It means he holds the highest position in the land and as such much will be asked of him some fair and some not, like all people at work. Additionally, some people on your side think entitlements means a twenty year old slacking because he doesn't want to work. Most of you conveniently leave out the elderly who can no longer work or even wounded vets whose agent orange payouts are part of entitlements.

       what in the actual fuck are you talking about? none of that has a god damn thing to do with the fact that it is NOT the presidents job to fix a fucking water issue in flint, michigan.
      </p>
      <p>
       there is all sorts of awful shit happening in the US &amp; the world, is the president supposed to fix all of that too?  because you know, he totally can and stuff.

       double wtf as to what "my side" is exactly.  and again, how is any of what you said the slightest bit relevant to ANYTHING AT ALL?  great, safety nets are apparently thin (which is an entirely different subject and i would disagree with seeing as how we have generational welfare and people who dont really ever work but still live a better life than 80% of the world. doesnt seem all that thin in the grand scheme of things).... but ok, i see what that has to do with bad water in flint i guess.  thanks for valuable your input?

       the water crisis in flint began in spring 2014, over 3 years ago. trump has been president for 4 of those months. the previous president had 33 months to correct the situation in your eyes. i assume you were just as hard on him, or were more critical as he had8 times the amount of time to rectify the situation

       As for 54 billion. He increased military DEFENCE budget to protect the US. Which I personally don't find anything wrong with that if it was for other military projects or a different part, sure I would be, but that is not the case.

       "Every gun that is made, every warship launched, every rocket fired signifies, in the final sense, a theft from those who hunger and are not fed, those who are cold and are not clothed.

      <p>
       This world in arms in not spending money alone.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is spending the sweat of its laborers, the genius of its scientists, the hopes of its children.

       The cost of one modern heavy bomber is this: a modern brick school in more than 30 cities.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is two electric power plants, each serving a town of 60,000 population.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is two fine, fully equipped hospitals.
      </p>

      </p>

      </p>
      <p>
       This, I repeat, is the best way of life to be found on the road the world has been taking.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is not a way of life at all, in any true sense. Under the cloud of threatening war, it is humanity hanging from a cross of iron."
