        Hi. We are Pandas4Bernie. And we’ve come back to say a few things about the speculation raging on the internet about our social media account and the late Seth Rich.
       </p>
       <p>
        First, let's state the obvious:
        <strong>
         this account did not belong to Seth Rich
        </strong>
        . We created Pandas4Bernie as a
        <strong>
         collective project
        </strong>
        , to build a library of educational memes we hoped would be fun and useful for grassroots progressives.
        <strong>
         We never heard the name Seth Rich until news broke of his untimely death in the aftermath of the DNC email leaks.
        </strong>
        That terrible week at the DNC was the final straw for many of us; so we made the decision to retire Pandas4Bernie and made our #Demexit, most of us moving on to the Greens.
       </p>
       <p>
        Imagine our surprise when nearly one year later, we learn that our dormant little panda lair had been re-discovered and cast as a major piece of a viral
        <strong>
         conspiracy meme
        </strong>
        ; In the same weekend, the trauma of last year’s DNC repeats itself as an unrepentant, corrupt party elite reassert their dominance at the CA state convention. Progressives walked out of the convention hall yesterday feeling abused and betrayed after a pharmaceutical lobbyist was ‘elected’ as party chair amidst a firestorm of protests and allegations of election fraud - like Keith Ellison before her, and Bernie before that.
       </p>
       <p>
        Perhaps the
        <strong>
         bizarre coincidences
        </strong>
        that pulled our little group into the spotlight, at this time and in this way, says something about what you wanted to see; but maybe also what we all need to hear as our movement stands at the crossroads. In this brief opening that meme magic happened to bestow upon us, we have an opportunity and responsibility to speak honestly to you, our
        <strong>
         fellow Berners and seekers of hope
        </strong>
        . We know some of you are reading this with disappointment;
        <strong>
         you’d hoped this was the smoking gun that proves Seth Rich’s whistleblower identity once and for all. We can’t pretend that Pandas4Bernie is something it’s not.
        </strong>
        What we do know is that the DNC emails are still real; they outline the nature of our current impasse; they expose real problems which still go unresolved. The DNC’s intractable refusal to reckon with these problems has only deepened the void between social needs and political representation - that gave us Trump, the opioid epidemic, and other “diseases of despair.” Smoking guns solve historical puzzles, but it cannot close the gap; only politics can do that.
       </p>
       <p>
        Of all the attention Pandas4Bernie has received in the last few days, we hear a good bit of talk about the inspiration people have drawn from what they thought to be Seth’s words, in our ‘Manifesto for a Movement,’ written at a moment of uncertainty to remind us of the importance of resolve. We may not be Seth Rich, but we can do justice to his life by extending the effects of his work, by honoring the courage of whistleblowers who put their lives on the line to expose the truths that animate our demands for justice, and ultimately to break the power of corrupt, undemocratic elites once and for all over our lives and institutions.
       </p>
       <p>
        Faced with an insurgent progressive wing whose spontaneous energy cannot guarantee their ability to contain it, party elites resort to ever greater mechanisms of coercive control, dispensing with even the slightest concession to its political base. Why? Because they fear our power, palpable in the energy we bring that transforms their spaces. What those who control us fear most is the moment when we realize we don't actually need them.
       </p>
       <p>
        When our leaders betrayed us at the DNC, Berners were united with each other as we walked out of that convention hall. Even today, as many different forces threaten to divide us, we must keep faith in the courage of our convictions, and our eyes on the prize of a just, equitable, and livable future we fight for because we must.
        <strong>
         We created Pandas4Bernie as a collective identity
        </strong>
        , so that the pandas could represent any one of us at any given time. And so it goes. You thought the pandas were Seth Rich for a time - and for that time it meant something to you. What you see in the pandas - and in all our heroes, the flawed human beings and politicians that inevitably disappoint our expectations - is a reflection of your own revolutionary dreams. The pandas aren’t Seth Rich anymore, but maybe now the pandas are free once again to be us all. Pandas, like true revolutionaries, are an endangered species. But sometimes, in the darkest of times, a new hope comes along...
       </p>

      <p>
       They are currently refusing to back any of their claims, explain how Seth Rich's email and phone number and personal details were directly attached to all these accounts and refuse to provide original artwork to show the "education memes" are theirs.
      </p>
      <p>
       This
       <strong>
        is
       </strong>
       Seth Rich's account. And it has been hijacked by people colluding with his murderers.

       Maybe I'm misreading what u/TrumpSucksHisBalls was trying to say. The way I understood it, I thought he was suggesting that Rich might be running the Pandas4Bernie account for this group without them knowing. I'll edit my comments if he clarifies. Personally, I believe this press-release from them is highly suspicious, and it looks like someone has gained access to Rich's accounts

       Maybe I misread the original comment. I'm of a firm belief that Seth Rich was the leaker; that the DNC (Hillary) had him killed (just look at the Clinton's body count); that the panda social media accounts were Rich's; and that the muh Russian hackers is a crock of shit.

       Very few people actually voted for Hillary. She lost the primary, and stole it through vote flipping.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you look at the polls they were running before the election, they were over-sampling Democrats by double digits, sometimes 20% or more, and it was still close.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is simply no way the election was close, Hillary lost badly. Before anyone downvotes and start screaming at me about party politics (which I have NO INTEREST IN), go read actual polling data and confirm it for yourself.

       Yeah sure if you believe that then that is fine.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just remember that voter ID laws don't exist for a reason. Remember the undercover video of someone in NY saying they were Huma Aberdin and they let her vote without ID? Or someone on camera saying how they bus people in from other cities.
      </p>
      <p>
       In PA all you have to do is say the name of someome who lives in that district. Then sign their name in a book and go press a button.
      </p>
      <p>
       One more question, we know black turnout is usually low. In inner city communities what is to stop the people working the polls from just signing a bunch of names of people who didn't vote and then simply pressing a button in a booth? How can you catch that? It's impossible.

       Voter ID laws don't exist because they depress turnout by minorities, young people, and the elderly. Also, there is a bit of history you may want to check out called "The South Between Reconstruction and The Civil Rights Act." It could be enlightening.
      </p>
      <p>
       And for the record, there is absolutely no proof of widespread voter fraud. Even if true, you have provided an anecdote of one person voting illegally.
      </p>
      <p>
       Please provide any documented proof that you have, I am more than willingly to be open-minded about it.

       What about it? The popular vote doesn't do a very good job in determining political leaders simply because that's democracy- we are a republic, and we ellect officals to vote on behalf of the citizens they represent.

Or are you saying there was voter fraud in the MILLIONS and Trump chose not to push for an investigation? Odd choice, was he scared it would turn out he actually lost by more than 3 million? Also odd that his approval is sinking fast below 40% when everyone loves Trump like you said.

Further, cellphone-only households are now as likely to fall into national Gallup polls samples as those living in traditional landline households." (from Gallup's site- lots of polls use cell phones these days. It did almost work just saying what you want to be true regardless of reality though, you had me for a sec)

       Most of the polls use automatic dialers, the rare ones who don't - like Gallup - can use cell phones. If you don't dial the number manually, you can't call a cell phone.

       To try to give him the benefit of the doubt, I seem to recall having read something about it actually being illegal for auto-dialers to call cellular numbers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course, this doesn't actually stop it from happening.  For context, I was in a, "sales," position, but it
       <em>
        ONLY
       </em>
       called people that had submitted their information directly to us because they were interested in the services we offered.

       Here are a few relevant links.  I'm too drunk to actually try to give you a breakdown on them, but I have faith in you, stranger.

       Yeah, honestly, when I made the response asking for a source, it was because I thought the guy was implying that auto-dialers actually couldn't dial cell lines because of like.... some technical reason.  Like you just couldn't do it.  Not because of a legal reason.
      </p>

       In retrospect, I should have realized he was referring to the legality of it.

       I think it is important to note that just because they aren't using an auto-dialer doesn't mean they aren't being called by anyone.  I have background in this.
      </p>
      <p>
       For the auto-dialer I used to work with we had pools of numbers.  So pool 1 was filled with numbers using specific criteria, pool 2 with different criteria, and so on.  The dialer would be dialing 10 or 15 numbers at any given time (we were small), and if someone answered they would be connected to a live body or asked to wait on hold until someone was available to talk with them.  Obviously we can't know what is or isn't a cell number just by looking at it, so if we were told this was a cell number we would flag that number as a cell so when that pool is built again it won't grab that number anymore.  Additionally we hired companies that kept databases of information about numbers, one of which being if that number was a cell number or not.  So we'd flag those numbers and remove them from the auto-dialer as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now what's my point?  My point is when we flagged a number as a cell number we'd just put them in a separate pool.  So rather than having the auto-dialer calling automatically and putting people on hold, the cell phone pool would be dialed "manually".  Essentially our caller would talk with someone, hang up, hit a button that dialed the next available number in the pool and talk with that person/hang up/leave a message.  It obviously wasn't as fast as an auto-dialer, but when you tell your employees to use pool X they can get through it fairly rapidly.
      </p>
      <p>
       So yah, it was illegal to call cell numbers using an auto-dialer and I tried to make sure we didn't call those numbers, but that doesn't mean those numbers didn't get called in a simple and quick manner.  Our dialer was old too, so I'd imagine it might be even simpler nowadays.

       This is simply not true of automatic dialers, they literally just generate tones that tell the phone switching network what to do, like a robotic touch tone phone.  You may be thinking of the nations Do Not Call registry that prevents telemarketers from calling cell phones?

       I agree- Trump won so IMHO it was odd to hear him talking about the vote totals weeks into his presidency. As for Stein's recounts (I believe Clinton wasn't involved other than that it affected her campaign so she was involved to that degree, I may be wrong) but regardless when margins are close and lots of people are worried about voter fraud it doesn't hurt to make sure- especially since she raised the money for it. Thought it was another state or two as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I was more saying that even if the polls were way off, Clinton ended with a substantial popular vote lead. Not saying that in a partisan way, that was just the count regardless of oversampling etc

       I would suggest reading literature about how voting fraud is detected. It's generally based on significant deviation from polling data. Or read the studies that have been put out showing fraud in the Democratic primaries, the Republican primaries in 2012, or both of Bushes elections.

       I don't doubt you're suggesting legitimate studies to check out (like you said, don't want to get into a political argument).

       I'm just confused by you saying that the election wasn't close, very few people voted for Hillary and that she lost badly. Obviously the EC vote wasn't close but in terms of # of votes that Americans cast she won by millions. Furthermore, the popular vote results were pretty much in line with polling, and in the battleground states that went red to give T the win, polls were showing that he was trending up fast near the election. Also, the margin in those critical states was small.
      </p>
      <p>
       I apologize if I'm missing what you're saying, just don't see evidence of "Very few people actually voted for Hillary".

       Read the polling data before the election, see how it was skewed towards Democrats and she still was barely winning, and then look at who owns the voting machines.

       The organization that brought us Hillary. I'm not going to try and point out connections or speculate as to the scope of their influence. But suffice it to say Hillary was but a pawn and after her usefulness ran dry she was discarded like the trash she's always been.

       I disagree. The message that they are passing is the last message on earth that a DNC person would resort to. That message is coming from the other wing of the party, and DNC is going to enormous trouble and expense to pretend it doesn't exist.

       Sure. All that I can say honestly is that there are a lot of people who feel the way that guy feels and that the DNC is quite determined to prevent us from taking the party over and cleaning house.

       It's crazy how they marginalize so many to hold on to control of the party. Especially since they've lost so many elections. Instead of cleaning house they double down on the same dumb mistakes and ramped up Brock's propaganda.

       And now there is a special counsel loose in Washington. I don't see how that special counsel can possibly avoid investigating the WikiLeaks. Remember: the very first version of the "Russian Narrative" was an attempt to discredit WikiLeaks.

       If they want to avoid it I'm sure they will find a way. The few of those hearings I've watched, they avoided it or tagged Russia to wikileaks whenever they did mention it.

       The fact that they control the account is far better evidence than you have supplied. The fact that they are spreading a message that is distinctly counter to the interests of Team Hillary is far better evidence than you have supplied. The group has a sub r/DEMEXIT/ that seems on-topic and is far older than the discovery of this account, and that is far better evidence than you have supplied. So I'm just gonna go with the better evidence, K?

        <p>
         they control the account

       You'd have to establish a link to seth and those accounts before it was relevant that his passwords were leaked. After his passwords came out his srich and the panda4rprogress emails had their access changed, but the pandas4bernie remains unaltered still.

       There is a clear link to seth and panda4progress and megrimlock4, but there was zero evidence he was the owner of pandas4bernie to begin with. Only that they both have panda in the name, that they stopped posting at the same time(which they didn't) and that they had the same recovery phone(which they didn't) there was no likes or follows in common with his verified accounts leading it to be that, he did not speak in anywhere the same style as the bernie account, despite the unsourced SYNTAX MATCH PERFECTLY! memes from 4chan.
      </p>
      <p>
       So don't pretend I'm saying none of the accounts are his, and give some evidence that the BERNIE accounts were owned by seth, because thats what we're talking about, and there is none.

       Every proposition is either true or false. Many of them are undecidable, but this one's pretty easy. The argument against this proposition is easy to make and understand; nobody seems to be able to make a coherent argument for for this proposition; proposition rejected.

       I think you're right that it's not really an indication, but I do think it's worth noting that A LOT of people are claiming because it doesn't mention hillary, its clearly a fake DNC shill. When since it's still very against the DNC's message I don't think that's a valid point against it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Though also the the DNC is pretty incompetant so they would try to come in and say "Hey Kids, hillary is cool now, thats why we stopped posting. We're voting for her in 2020!"

       Fair point. The political part of the message is aimed directly at the ideological divide currently tearing the Democratic coalition apart. I guess they might choose to blow up the DNC in order to escape in the confusion if they're trying to cover up a political assassination on American soil--you know, it's plausible and all--but it sure isn't well supported by anything that I've seen.

       They probably realize that a post on r/s4p with 120 upvotes isn't going to "blow up the DNC," especially if literally rigging the primaries for a particular candidate didn't have much of an effect to that end.

       But rigging the primaries DID have an effect: there's a hard split in the Democratic coalition that's getting wider by the day. The establishment power play that the panda account is talking about is playing out all over the country, the 2018 Democratic primaries will be savagely contested, and every establishment candidate that manages to win those primaries is going to have to win the general without our (progressive Democrats) votes.

       Not the guy you responded to but honestly I don't see any actual evidence either way. I'm not saying he definitely was or wasn't but its hard for me to fall on either side of this without any evidence that isn't circumstantial. I'm keeping my mind open but I definitely think it's disengenious to say that either side has evidence.

       Assange is all about imply things without stating anything. He's never stated Rich was the leaker, and he's never stated that Rich was in contact with Kim.

       That's your opinion. The above poster asked for sources. That's two direct and named sources. You don't know what's going on. The murder isn't solved and yet these two guys have voiced info. Kdc u equivocally said it is Seth and he knows and Assange very strongly insinuated it multiple times.

       Those aren't sources. Kim has lied about similar things in the recent past. He offered zero evidence, when it would be easy to provide.

       Assange has not said anything. He's implied plenty, but is careful not to state anything definitive. Why is that?

       If you cared about Seth Rich or the conspiracy to kill him, the facts laid out would and should be honest. You are continuing a false reality because facts are that pandas4bernie was never connected to Seth Rich outside of speculation.

       Incase your unaware, the shills have massive chat rooms where they discuss tactics, topics etc. all day. When a shill finds something like this, they simply copy and paste the link to the chat room and within seconds, you have hundreds if not thousands of paid shills downvoting the post in unison. Could explain why your post dropped in points so quickly.

       This tactic was observed in the subreddit /MarchAgainstTrump where the top moderator ignorantly commented that this is what he does with his discord to promote posts to the front page, as well as using bots.

       Oh yes. That most humble of mechanisms, their greatest fear: intuition. They have a firm grasp on all things logical, only in the sense that they completely control what can talked about, but they can't fight a man who can see patterns and trusts his gut more than his teachers/bosses/elected representatives/those placed above others' authority simply for authority's sake. In ages past, when peoples were oppressed and silenced in the fashion we are being silenced today, there have come individuals who specialize in saying without saying. Those like stand up comics, who deal in questioning norms in a way that lets us laugh rather than divide us (such a skill); playwrights and actors and the like, who through metaphor and analogy point right to the corrupted heart of a society; and of course above all, and perhaps through nothing more than pure sublimation, musicians who speak directly to the heart without a reason. For instance, there was a time during one of the Great Wars, in a country I can't place, when the people were oppressed in much the same we we are now being oppressed, with the same sense that you are not safe if you talk about certain groups or nations or religions, etc., and a composer wrote this piece that contained the feeling they all shared but were unable to express. When the orchestra finished, one critic said it was like a vacuum, then one woman started to openly weep, followed by the entire audience following suit. I really wish I could remember the guy's name, or the piece, or the country, but maybe it's fitting in the sense that we are talking about valuing the intuitive above the logical (names and dates vs substance and ideas).

       Wow - thanks for that, that was extremely interesting. I wouldn't say I'm bad at math, it has always fascinated me and I still learn more and more about it as time goes by. I'm good at counting in my head, finding solutions to problems (IMO), and also really I'm very emotional. I'm a very "energy" focused person too. Positive energy, negative energy, it effects me and I can feel it. The problem sometimes is I like to give people the benefit of the doubt. Have you ever seen the movie Pi? I am very interested in numerology, patterns (you did mention that :) and equations.

       You sound like a fascinating mix of traits, and I'm honestly glad to have you here, just in the sense that it's nice to meet a reasonable fellow who sees the world in a unique way. Especially when we're bombarded with so much angst these days..
      </p>
      <p>
       I do love things like numerology, holofractals, sacred geometry, various religions' versions of Gematria, but I haven't seen Pi. I went and started to read a few paragraphs of a detailed synopsis so I could have a basic understanding of what you were talking about, and instead I'm gonna go watch it. I haven't watched a movie since 2013, so, seriously, thanks.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since you like esoteric junk and occult (like hidden knowledge, not crazies with robes in the forest) stuff, I just found what I think is safe to say is the singularly most interesting thing I have ever found in this vein.
      </p>
      <p>
       Have you read the CIA Gateway project papers that they recently declassified? In it, the writer talks about how he was tasked with creating a scientific and actionable understanding of the already reproducible act of astral projection/remote viewing and things of that nature which had caught the eye of the government in the late 60s and early 70s. It's where those posts about that remote viewer who went to Mars 1 billion years in the past come from.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyways, there's this guy named Itzhak Bentov who was the man behind the science behind the organization that would later be turned into Project Gateway that would later be turned into the movie titled The Men Who Stare at Goats, and he was like you in that he loved the "energy" of things and felt that they were out there, and as such was an accomplished meditator, while also being a "nuts and bolts guy", as he put it. That combination of traits led him to fully understand that there were physical effects that took place in the body of a practiced meditator when they are deep in various states, yet concurrently desire for a rational, logical explanation for it all; it wasn't enough to have it work, he wanted to know exactly why.
      </p>
      <p>
       The conclusion that he came to, using quite a lot of rigorous methods, was that the body in meditation is acting as a resonator, and that this is accomplished by entraining various normally opposed systems of the body into a more harmonic state. For example, when the heart pumps blood, it sends a pressure wave through our blood vessels that make their way to our feet and begin to rise again, so as an old pressure wave is making it's way up your leg, it meets a new one, causing an interference pattern like when you throw a bunch of rocks into a calm lake, but through meditation of various sorts, various peoples have throughout time have learned to entrain their heart withing specific frequencies that the human body is naturally attuned to, allowing a more uniform and structured wave form, which then begins to entrain other systems of the body until the hemisphere's of the brain begin to resonate with each other such that your consciousness begins to then inhabit this resonance rather than inhabiting the two normally-inharmonic hemispheres of the brain at once, creating the much-touted feeling of novel yet powerful unity and oneness, in addition to odd abilities such as traveling out of body.
      </p>
      <p>
       This was picked up by a Dr. Robert Monroe, who created the subsequent The Monroe Institute, who caught the attention of the CIA, who then began to develop it militarily, which required a more scientific understanding than "it works and it's reliable like maybe 80% of the time", resulting in the paper I read about Project Gateway.

       I think the world needs more non-sexual bromantic sentiments, but even if, scissoring would just be inneficient considering all the dangly bits and perfectly available holes that we could share. Poor lesbians... Scissoring must feel a little like when my dog is in heat and tries to rub up on a pillow.

       Hey thanks man, still here! Happy to have you here too. Glad you are going to watch Pi it's a fascinating story if not a good cautionary tale. I have briefly heard of Gateway I have dabbled in lucid dreaming and astral projection myself. I have never seen the movie The Men Who Stare at Goats because it seemed too connected to the occult for me but I have seen some breakdowns of the movie. Do you think I should watch it? I did finally get around to Eyes Wide Shut and I did not regret it. The story of Itzhak Bentov sounds extra ordinary and his findings that you that you summarized make so much sense! I have to sit and Ponder on this thank you for sharing. It would be awesome if you linked me to your post when you finish it!

       But as far as The Men Who Stare at Goats, it was ok, nothing remarkable. You could for sure get more "meat" out of reading about Itzhak Bentov or watching that doc I linked, but there's no George Clooney that way, which is important in some ways. lol I'm sure you probably know, but just in case, occult is just an old Latin word for "hidden". I'm with you, the hiders are super scary, but the hidden is usually fucking rad.

       Interesting. Is this like a left brain vs right brain type of thing? It's curious to me, as I have always considered my intuition to be pretty spot on, but at the same time I tend to be fairly good at math. However, I've never tried to compare my intuition against that of anyone else, so perhaps it is not as great as I imagine.

       Yeah, left brain right brain stuff; all theory with no hard substance, but applicable more often than chance alone. And, personally, I've always thought of music as a metric for gauging intuition because it's something that
       <em>
        can
       </em>
       be put on paper, but never sounds good when read verbatim, so that it becomes something that you have to feel out, first and foremost. Like there are always the Sunday pianists who sit and play by rote no matter what, but there are very few musicians who gained skill through anything but a large dose of intuition. I'm probably biased, though, and I'm sure there are intuitive aspects to math or there would never be creation in that realm of things, but those are ma thoughts. :)

       Works for me. I believe it was Aristotle who said that music was a direct line to the soul. It's very interesting considering that a lot of spiritual beliefs focus greatly on vibration, which is of coarse what makes all of sound, including music. I've heard that musicians tend to be good at math, but it was anecdotal, so who knows if it's true. In any case, thanks for sharing your perspective with me. :)

       First the way you wrote the title. You make the claim the pandas4bernie editors are Seth's murders. Second, you make the claim that pandas4bernie is attached to Seth Rich which is completely false and disingenuous. Not once was that account attached to Seth Rich outside of speculation of the word panda and the number 4.
      </p>
      <p>
       Mods should be tagging this as misleading or make you repost it because of the false claims.

       So the guy makes one post and then doesn't reply in the comments at all? Having not posted on Reddit since 11 months ago?

       Even if it's not Seth's account, the guy could not have done a better job of making it look like someone trying to put out fires for fear of people looking closer.

       Exactly. Let's get this out of the way now: no one will ever openly admit that the DNC's officials knew about Seth and had him neutralized.
      </p>
      <p>
       But when you start seeing clues like this, don't allow your brain to be easily convinced one way or another,  it don't be scared of coming to your own conclusions. Are they hinting something here?? The biggest thing with people is that they get uncomfortable when faced with dissenting opinions and this runs counter to the idea that Seth was robbed

       My point was none of those items are what I would put in the background if I were going to be interviewed on television not that the Panda is a Disney character. Though now that you bring it up there are multiple Disney characters that are pandas.
      </p>
      <p>
       Either way the point is, just because it seems strange to you doesn't mean there's no other explanation other the "The DNC Murdered Seth Rich".

       They're just so used to killing whoever they want without any public interest. This must be driving them crazy. The fact that they're putting so much effort into this cover up is damned close to proof as far as I'm concerned. If it were just a botched robbery, none of this would be happening.

       I notice this lie keeps being spammed word for word and then they link to some random Reddit account. Which is odd because people like you also don't link to the breaking Seth Rich posts they apparently first created.

       Which is probably because this news

       So what's the evidence they are seths? they have different styles and speech, didnt have any noticeable followers in common, had different recovery phones, and didnt stop posting at the same time. It's just that it has panda in the name at this point.

       How about, since you're continuing defending the user who claimed the user who broke the story retracted it,
       <strong>
        you

       can provide a link for that instead of ignoring what I've replied to.

       Thanks for posting that, but it's kind of useless. These people aren't interested in actually solving Seth Rich's murder, they're too busy finding easy answers and playing kiddy detective. MeGrimlock4 and panda4progress are the only accounts confirmed as Seth Rich's. There is literally nothing linking Seth to pandas4bernie except a somewhat similar username to one of his existing username and the liking of pandas, and the fact that before this new post they had stopped posting a few months apart from each other but hadn't made a post since Seth's death. *That's it. That never proved anything, and if you were smart enough to check the verification phone numbers of
       <a href="mailto:seth.c.rich@gmail.com">
        seth.c.rich@gmail.com
       </a>
       vs
       <a href="mailto:panda4progress@gmail.com">
        panda4progress@gmail.com
       </a>
       and
       <a href="mailto:pandas4bernie@gmail.com">
        pandas4bernie@gmail.com
       </a>
       BEFORE an unknown party changed the phone number on the first two confirmed Seth Rich emails, the first two had phone numbers that ended in 20 which matches Seth Rich's phone number. Pandas4Bernie had two completely different numbers at the end that matched neither that nor the new numbers that those accounts have been changed to. Tighten up people, if this is the best we've got, we're no better than Rachel damn Maddow whining about Russia. We have to do better.

       The Pandas4Bernie verification number ended in 02 (compared to the 20 number that was actually his) and people started saying "they're pretty much the same. Seth Rich confirmed". That's how it was "confirmed" to be Seth Rich's account.

       No I think you got it right., the Seth Rich accounts ended in 20 (which were his) and I was just adding that the Pandas4Bernie number ended 02 and people considered it "close enough" to say it was his

       Wow, a Bernie support group. Stop posting after their candidate LOST. How strange. Show me another support group from a failed candidate that still active?

      <ul>
       <li>
        Ben Carson - no sign of life
       </li>
       <li>
        Jeb Bush - dead

        Martin O'Malley - not a peep

       But yeah, since it was Bernie, them going dark must have been proof they were Seth. Give me a break.

       However, one of these cases has a dead body attached to it and deserves to be investigated. The other is a mainstream media psyop.

       Not true. I have the pastebin, which you can compare to what is there now. That probably won't suffice for someone that spent the absolute minimum effort to request it... not even writing a full sentence. Such a person would probably only accept an archive.is link, which I do not have, but should be searchable for.

       Reading the comments on that post and here, it sounds like people are already convinced that the account belonged to Seth Rich. What could pandas4bernie say? "I'm not Seth Rich"? Try to argue with people that already think you're covering up a politically motivated murder?

       Schrodinger's Seth Rich account.

      <p>
       As with all information that we may not be 100% certain of, we have to treat each side of it as being true, and follow where the information surrounding that will lead us.
      </p>
      <p>
       That said though, if we remove what people are telling us we see from our vision and look at what we're actually seeing, there appears to be a huge scandal involving a deceased DNC staffer who evidence points towards being murdered for leaking information.
      </p>
      <p>

       An investigation works by examining connections. The more connections, the closer you get to finding the truth in what happened. Solving a murder isn't always just "Oh hey the guy confessed". Sometimes is a huge, tangled web with dozens of people involved in some way or another.
      </p>
      <p>
       Those of us paying attention have a huge amount of evidence and are spreading it everywhere we possibly can.

       No, investigations work by gathering evidence and going where the evidence leads you. If you try hard enough, you can connect anything to anyone. It doesn't necessarily hurt to speculate and theorize, but you cannot start with your conclusion and then work backwards.

       When Seth was murdered, the_donald posters went into immediate "I bet he was assassinated by the DNC!" mode. Then they worked backwards to find connections that might help their claim. Even if Seth
       <em>
        was
       </em>
       the leaker (which there's no evidence of), that's
       <em>
        still
       </em>
       not enough to say that he was murdered by the DNC. You can't solve a murder based on motive alone

       He posted his own email address along with a lot of other personally identifiable information, all archived on numerous PCs (including mine), and through the Internet Archives, all of which was then immediately and hastily edited by unknown parties, in much the same way as Paul Combetta's profile was deleted after it had been archived, leaving those with the ability to intuit patterns with a raging clue. You don't even know, my clue is so hard right now.

       Of course, but they're attempting to lump the two accounts together with their dismissal, so I say let's just go with it. I.e, it shouldn't matter if one account among many is not directly tied to him personally if but a single one is found to be true and shows a motive for his being the whistle blower. But what am I saying, the media and those that defend these murderers would never let that distinction make it to our screens, if you have anything to say about it, right?

       So the bottom line is that there is no evidence that the pandas4bernie account ever belonged to Rich, but it's being treated as if it may as well have been because if it was, then it supports a bunch of other stuff that also apparently can't be substantiated.

       What's especially annoying is how the Seth Rich conspiracy theory is being used as a justification for conspiracy theorists and MAGA CHUDs to roll their eyes at any Russia connection. Never heard how Seth Rich leaked Podesta's emails though, or the DCCC's.

       Firstly, they didn't all go "dark" at the same time. They stopped posting like a month apart. First pandas4bernie because
       <a href="https://twitter.com/Pandas4Bernie/status/867135307396694016">
        "there was no point as long as Bernie was sheepdogging for the DNC".

      <p>
       You don't think the fact that one uses singular (panda4progress) and the other is plural (pandas4bernie) is significant? That's a completely different naming convention. What about this circumstantial evidence?
      </p>
      <p>
       What about the fact that they both used
       <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/6c1rj9/not_a_drill_pedes_with_clues_from_pol_and_other/dhrom36/?context=3">
        different recovery phone numbers?
       </a>
       Are you going to ignore this circumstantial evidence?

      <p>
       And what about
       <strong>
        concrete
       </strong>
       evidence we do have: the statement from
       <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/SandersForPresident/comments/6csf5w/pandas4bernie_here_we_are_not_seth_rich_but_we/">
        panda4bernie

       themselves?

      <p>
       Honestly, what evidence do you

       think is more compelling?

       Rich's certain accounts were MeGrimlock4 on reddit and @Panda4progress on Twitter. 4progress implies he was a progressive, which implies he could have been supporting Sanders. So between the naming scheme, Rich's love of pandas, and apparent political affiliation, it certainly seems possible.

       Except that Clinton supporters also consider themselves to be progressives. As far as I know, literally nothing in support of Sanders has ever been pulled from any of Rich's verified accounts. That's the kind of information that makes him look like a Sanders supporter; not the word

       Lots of people like pandas. What's more important is the question of why the pandas4bernie is
       <em>
        pandas
       </em>
       4bernie. It's entirely possible that it might be arbitrary, but that would make the theory stronger and their argument against it that much weaker.

       Anything

       possible when you can imagine it. The question is whether or not it is actually technically possible for that account to ever have belonged to Rich. If you want to believe in a conspiracy theory, you should first try your hardest to prove that it is wrong.

       James, I'm trying to prove a point:
      </p>
      <p>
       1) You can't prove anyone is connected to a real reddit account because it violates site wide terms (DOX).
      </p>
      <p>
       2) I didn't attack anyone, just pointing out the blatant "Demand Evidence" tactics used by the account.  As pointed out in the side bar.
      </p>
      <p>
       3) I've been around here (yes in
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">

       ) for 8 years so give me a break.

       Pretty obvious.  Seth was literally the only person in the world who liked pandas or ever used the word pandas in a username.  He also invented the idea of using the number 4 in place of the conjunction for.  Now everyone does it, of course,  but back in 2016 he was the only one.

       If you look closely, they're sitting in front of still frames or lithographs from famous Disney animated movies, so having a stuffed version of an animal that's been in several of their movies doesn't seem too out of place.

       Looks like a small room that they keep their Disney stuff in, there's more of it in the background than just the lithographs.  The stuffed animal wouldn't be out of place in the room especially given Seth's apparent affection for pandas.  The placement on screen is abnormal, but having worked TV interview shoots sometimes the producers make some odd set dressing choices to humanize their subjects or hide ugly things in the background

       Don't you think its more likely they used the panda "to honor" Seth? As opposed to them just finding a panda laying around and deciding to put it in view during the interview?
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not saying there's some hidden message or anything. I just think its weird you're attributing the panda being there because you think the family if just a fan of Disney movies.

       Well what if the panda is a collectible Disney plush toy?  It would make sense that it's near their Disney stuff collection then.

       And what would it mean or prove if it was placed there to honor Seth?  What does that prove about this?

       Honestly, I don't think it really proves anything. I just think its weird that you think this family randomly has a panda bear with them for this interview for the sole reason that they like Disney movies. Its clearly supposed to be some sort of recognition for Seth.
      </p>
      <p>
       Really, I just think its bizarre that you're sticking with "the panda has nothing to do with SR, the family just really likes Disney movies and they just so happened to have a panda teddy bear laying around, so why not include it in our interview!"

       I don't generally like to read too much into body language, but doesn't it look like the young guy (I assume it's Seth's brother) is trying to stifle laughter?  The interview was done three days after his death.

       There's nothing conclusive but given the fact that the ones that
       <em>

       Seth appear to have been tampered with recently (with the editing of a post to remove his email address, IIRC), I'd say there's definitely no smoke without fire.

       You mean the pandas4bernie reddit, tumblr, and twitter all went dark within days of Bernie being mathematically eliminated?  Is that what I should mention?  Because I don't think that will help your narrative, so you probably don't really want me to mention it.

       panda4progress (singular panda) and MeGrimlock4 are confirmed to have belonged to SR.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another user, pandas4bernie (plural pandas) was suspected to have been SR because they both reference pandas and they both stopped posting like a month apart (also, it fits the narrative that SR was the leaker, which many people are desperate to believe). Someone checked the verification phone number, but they were different.
      </p>
      <p>
       Still many people continue to claim that it was confirmed to be SR.
      </p>
      <p>
       Due to the rampant speculation, pandas4bernie released a statement (the one OP references) on all their social media platforms stating that they were not SR.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, rather than accept facts, people like OP are claiming that the DNC has taken over SR "confirmed" account to pretend that they are not SR (all without any evidence). It's pretty sick.

       I'm always interested in these kinds of things, but sometimes so much disinformation is going around that missing even a bit can leave someone confused (which is essentially the purpose of disinformation). This SR fiasco reeks of distraction.

       But now they've crossed a line by taking over Seth Rich's accounts and editing his posts. Ultimately, all this does is infuriate those of us who want justice and makes us want to dig deeper for answers.

       They've just taken over Seth Rich's Twitter account as well and are pulling the same bullshit, contradictory story after not posting since Seth Rich died.
      </p>
      <p>
       Their proof? When everyone asked for the original artworks to prove it is their account...they posted a screenshot
       <strong>
        of the timestamp data
       </strong>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       A easily edited screenshot of a timestamp. And, as everyone points out, the photo they use is simply a MSPaint-tier resize of the photo in question, which isn't how thumbnails work in file data.

       This is clearly written in a manner meant to evade and obfuscate. I bet several people wrote and edited this lengthy, meaningless denial. It rambles on explaining nothing, tying to co-opt Seth Rich's martyrdom in every paragraph. It almost sounds like an admission by the DNC, as to why the DNC lost the election due to corruption, twisted into a denial of it being Seth's social media profile.
      </p>
      <p>
       This over the top reaction is proof that they don't want this murder investigated or publicized any further. The DNC already stopped DC metro, they have already stopped the FBI and the other owned agencies.
      </p>
      <p>
       The DNC murdered Seth Rich, Seth Rich is the source of the DNC leaks

       Good.Fucking.Call NotAllMenAreLikeThat....I love it when a member of the community here connects the dots and makes a prediction based on the patterns made by the MSM over the years.
      </p>
      <p>
       The MSM is pro-Clinton/anti-Trump. I guess the mission is to find out WHO it is that runs between the Clintons, corporate media owners that gives the MSM their marching orders.
      </p>
      <p>
       The waters of the DNC/Clinton crime family run very deep.

       Add that even if you grant that the pandas4bernie Reddit and Twitter accounts may not be Seth (but the panda4progress account is) it seems a bit too convenient for those accounts to come back alive just in time to preempt the kimdotcom stuff which as we see now is linked to the panda alias.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the communications were being monitored and were the source of unmasking Seth's as the leaker, then the unmaskers would be aware that kimdotcom's announcement would likely involve the panda connection, and their best move is to muddy those waters.

       You slander these people without providing any counter evidence because they are using Seth Rich's, another claim that you have no evidence to substantiate, and then you attack anyone that questions you. I got that about right?

       So, is the implication that Seth Rich fed the Podesta emails to Wikileaks as an attempt to Slander the Trump campaign, and then later to delegitimize the Trump administration? And that the murder was tying up loose ends?

       Weeks before from what I've seen. Add on to that the timing perfectly coincides with when Bernie was cut out of the race (the reason the account went inactive) and the user who posted Pandas4Bernie as a Seth Rich account has since admitted they were wrong.

       predict that this 2nd account,

       Fake is pretty dismissive, don't you think?  What part is fake?  Was he murdered?  Yes.  Are people looking to find the killers regardless if you think he was the leaker or not?  Yes.

       See, not fake at all.  It's a conspiracy that things are this muddied, that is telling enough BECAUSE he

       This is amazing. So the account gets edited to remove his email address from one of the old posts and now it magically says it's not him and then fails to reply in the comments at all?

       Thanks for posting that, but it's kind of useless. These people aren't interested in actually solving Seth Rich's murder, they're too busy finding easy answers and playing kiddy detective. MeGrimlock4 and panda4progress are the only accounts confirmed as Seth Rich's. There is literally nothing linking Seth to pandas4bernie except a somewhat similar username to one of his existing username and the liking of pandas, and the fact that before this new post they had stopped posting a few months apart from each other but hadn't made a post since Seth's death. *That's it. That never proved anything, and if you were smart enough to check the verification phone numbers of
       <a href="mailto:seth.c.rich@gmail.com">
        seth.c.rich@gmail.com
       </a>
       vs
       <a href="mailto:panda4progress@gmail.com">
        panda4progress@gmail.com
       </a>
       and
       <a href="mailto:pandas4bernie@gmail.com">
        pandas4bernie@gmail.com
       </a>
       BEFORE an unknown party changed the phone number on the first two confirmed Seth Rich emails, the first two had phone numbers that ended in 20 which matches Seth Rich's phone number. Pandas4Bernie had two completely different numbers at the end that matched neither that nor the new numbers that those accounts have been changed to. Tighten up people, if this is the best we've got, we're no better than Rachel damn Maddow whining about Russia. We have to do better.

       Hm I'd really rather a court of law settle this than argue meaninglessly online, and that's all any of us are saying. We don't want to endlessly speculate. We have this whole massively expensive system that has been in place for centuries which specializes in handling things like this.

       Yeah, left brain right brain stuff; all theory with no hard substance, but applicable more often than chance alone. And, personally, I've always thought of music as a metric for gauging intuition because it's something that
       <em>
        can
       </em>
       be put on paper, but never sounds good when read verbatim, so that it becomes something that you have to feel out, first and foremost. Like there are always the Sunday pianists who sit and play by rote no matter what, but there are very few musicians who gained skill through anything but a large dose of intuition. I'm probably biased, though, and I'm sure there are intuitive aspects to math or there would never be creation in that realm of things, but those are ma thoughts. :)
