</blockquote>

<p>Thousands of years ago during the last ice age, mankind was divided by a wall of ice.</p>

<p>Existing Near the Equator, the Earth maintained the perfect conditions for life.</p>

<p>Within this Paradise there was abundance amounts of food and water.</p>

<p>Humanity was at peace, as our consciousness emerged from our Harmony with nature.</p>

<p>We began asking questions.</p>

<p>Eventually realizing that there was more to existence, then just surviving.</p>

<p>Our awareness allowed us to evolve beyond our primal instincts.</p>

<p>For it only requires a few generations of extreme growth.</p>

<p>Until there is no reason to consume endlessly in order to ensure our survival.</p>

<p>Its this wisdom and understanding, that we as a collective found peace.</p>

<p>The evolution of mankind is from within.</p>

<p>However during the earliest days the world was divided, by walls of ice and a endless ocean.</p>

<p>Humanity evolved separately for thousands of years...</p>

<p>The ice age ended and a great flood consumed our ancient cities.</p>

<p>The knowledge of the past was retained by the descendants of the ancients sages.</p>

<p>These descendants rebuilt civilization.</p>

<p>Due to their vast amounts of knowledge they formed an upper class.</p>

<p>It&#39;s from here that they rebuilt the mystery schools.</p>

<p>Educating the elites and preparing the initiates to rule over society.</p>

<p>The majority of the populace was displaced, as scattered tribes of hunters and gathers struggled to survive in the harsh conditions caused as a result of the great melt.</p>

<p>It&#39;s this division became the foundation of our modern civilization.</p>

<p>A group of educated and spiritual being using the ancient knowledge to declare themselves the descendants/messengers of Gods.</p>

<p>With their advanced knowledge, no mortal being dared questioned their divine authority.</p>

<p>However what began as fidelity and piety, evolved into slavery and servitude.</p>

<p>As absolute power became corruption, it&#39;s the practice of slavery that consumed and permeated the culture of our ancestors.</p>

<p>The once free, noble and proud beings of Earth became pawns within a great game played by corrupt aristocratic families.</p>

<p>These families raised vast armies, to protect, enslave and maintain control over vast city states that eventually became great empires.</p>

<p>As time passed the conflicts between these families, resulted in many wars.</p>

<p>The victims of war where then enslaved by the conquering empire.</p>

<p>A never ending vicious cycle of greed, war and slavery.</p>

<p>However once humanity began to revolt against slavery a new method to maintain power was introduced, indentured servitude.</p>

<p>That evolved into our modern day debt based fiat currency system.</p>

<p>The principle of every dollars borrowed plus interest must be repaid in full.</p>

<p>However since the interest of every dollar is never created, the principle of scarcity forces the population into indentured servitude.</p>

<p>As we are forced to constantly borrow money to pay the interest on loans that can never be repaid in full.</p>

<p>The monetary system is totally dependent upon a societies ability to perpetuate endless growth.</p>

<p>Once growth peaks, the system collapse, and the middle class is forced to default as the upper class buys our debt for pennies on the dollar.</p>

<p>The next generation then burrows money from the elites, to sells us back our defaulted assets at a profit.</p>

<p>Enslaving every generation of society, to a constant endless cycle of perpetual debt.</p>

<p>The Great Game is played by the most powerful, wealthiest and influential members of society in order to maintain their positions of power.</p>

<p>As the rest of humanity is far too busy climbing the imaginary ladder, fighting amongst ourselves we fail to see beyond the illusion created by the principle of scarcity.</p>

<p>While our Masters play a game...</p>

<p>There will be a day when the system collapses.</p>

<p>The Masters will buy back all the accumulated wealth, as a depression forces the majority to default on their loans.</p>

<p>It&#39;s at this moment we will realize that endless growth is unsustainable, the results of this moment will determine the future of humanity.</p>

<p>If enough are awakened, a single truth has the potential to free humanity.</p>

<p>With so many questions, and very few answer.</p>

<p>The populace will be susceptible to this truth, only when the veil of their illusions are finally broken.</p>

<p>It&#39;s within this panic, that we expose the greatest secret </p>

<p>A single truth into nature of the Universe, that all things are connected.</p>

<p>In order to achieve this outcome, we must learn to control our fears.</p>

<p>To embrace the moment and break free of our sub conscious barriers.</p>

<p>Thus at the moment of truth, we stand united.</p>

<p>That without them.</p>

<p>We as a collective will maintain the common good.</p>

<p>Rendering the Elites powerless.</p>

<p>For it&#39;s only Wisdom that has been lost.</p>

<p>Hidden from masses, it&#39;s our only key to unlocking mankinds true potential.</p>

<p>Once enough beings are wise, only then is humanity free.</p>

<p>Can&#39;t help but thinking it would make a wonderful children&#39;s book (with slight adjustments to the vocabulary used). It reads like poetry :)</p>
