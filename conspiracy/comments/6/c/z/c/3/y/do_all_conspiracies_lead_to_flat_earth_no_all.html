        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>A lot of you here, knows how deep the Rabbit Holes goes.  And yet so many of you don&#39;t want to acknowledge the elephant. God! Every lie we have been told, no matter if the lie was to make you wear a cross to show you&#39;re a Christian. Or to believe we are an insignificant cosmic accident. But, you knew whatever it was that they told you, it was a lie. </p>

<p>Because a lie feels fucked up. It&#39;s false. It sits in your gut, refusing to be shat out. Do you remember the first lie?</p>

<p>The one that the people we love the most told us? For some it was being told Santa isn&#39;t real. Or the reason daddy is never coming back home. For me it was being told I was normal. I&#39;m not. I&#39;ve never been. And that lie stays with us forever, because we will never trust our parents as much as we did before the lie. </p>

<p>But they were lied to by their parents. And their parents before them. We never had a fucking chance in this world. I know what a lot of you know the truth, but won&#39;t or can&#39;t say. And I can die. Easily. I&#39;m nothing. I won&#39;t be missed. </p>

<p>I wouldn&#39;t want to be missed. I have done nothing to deserve being remembered. I&#39;m a distant mediocre husband to a bored wife. I&#39;m an above average father to a son who deserves better. </p>

<p>But If there is one thing I will do, is tell someone every truth that my Creator has shown me. </p>

<p>There is no other way I can tell you this. Every conspiracy we have been chasing runs through him! JFK, Roswell, 9/11, Illuminati, Free Masonry, witchcraft, NASA, everything!  Every lie in this world has ultimately come from one master. He is a God to every religion on Earth. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t mean to offend you! I cried when I threw my cross away. I was so indoctrinated that I thought lightening would strike me. This is going to be the hardest pill to swallow. </p>

<p>The occult rules the world. Every thing from the fast food we eat, to the movies we watch, to the Dow Jones, to the NFL, to the day of the week is the result of the occult. This is the fourth dimension. Science isn&#39;t real here. Magic is. </p>

<p>And they use us. For our energy. To do these rituals. Our emotions. Our blood. Our sperm. Our feces. Are just magical ingredients for these monsters. </p>

<p>They keep us in a constant state of fear to feed off our energy. And you will laugh at me but the truth is electricity is not real. It&#39;s us! Our spirits. Our ancestors. They power their empire with not just the blood of innocents. But their very essence. If you allow yourself to die without redeeming you are trapped in hell!</p>

<p>They make us work all day. Give our kids up for 12 hours of brain washing. We come home and eat, sleep. They make new taxes. Feed you poison. Medicate you. Put you on jail for medicating without paying you. They have brought hell on earth through us.</p>

<p>That&#39;s the irony. It&#39;s our fault Satan controls the world. That is something I believe we all will answer for one day. </p>

<p>I will tell you what I know about this evil world. </p>

<p>There is no such thing as the USA. Its real name is Amuruka which is a snake deity. But what this country is spiritually is Egypt. You thought they got wiped out? Nope. They moved here. They mockingly puts their pyramid on our money as they love to mock us in plain sight. That&#39;s probably a ritual as well. </p>

<p>This country is a part of the Holy Roman Empire. Or just call it Rome as they have stop ruling the world. The Windsors control this world. The anti Christ is the future King William V who will to be descended from Jesus and King Arthur. </p>

<p>And Jesus is a pagan deity. I&#39;m sorry. Call him Nimrod, Osiris, whatever you want but the cross is a pagan idol that you are not supposed to worship. Christianity is controlled by Lucifer. </p>

<p>The Zionist who resides in Israel are Egyptian and Babylonians who control the worlds money, arts, and drugs. They kidnap thousands of children for their rituals. They also poison our foods and medicine. They want you to die. </p>

<p>There are three over arching conspiracies that affect us. The main was is the typical one world government that you all knew was coming. The Romans want to keep their empire and are status quo, they have the military. But they are the most scared of us. They knew we could over power them if everyone knew the truth. </p>

<p>The Left Hand are a mix of witches, entertainers, and nature worshippers. They have a lot of money from Christianity and Hollywood. They spread the lie about Global Warming. They believe that 95% of us need to die. In the world of duality they worship Satan which is the dark side of Lucifer. </p>

<p>And you have the slave masters the Egyptians and Babylonian who control the Middle East.  They use our war for rituals. They believe they can attain Godhead by these death rituals. They have influenced every government and industry in the world. </p>

<p>All of this! All of this for us? They went overboard. All of this. The only answer could be is the devil is fighting this hard for me than God has to be real. </p>

<p>Things are going to change before this year is up. Forever. You know everyone talking about the rapture. That is what depresses me the most. I think. I saw the number being so small. It&#39;s not a lot of us. 99.9 percent of the world is going to suffer untold death and destruction. No matter what I say I don&#39;t how to save us. All I can do is tell you the truth as I know it. And yes sometimes I wish I was just crazy. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Are you talking about the God of Christianity?  I am Christian but I worry that the bible has been altered over time.

    <div class="md"><p>No religion on Earth follows every commencement. That should be the litmus test for any religion. The sun worshippers has us forsaking the sabbath.  We don&#39;t even call God and his son by their original Hebrew names making us take their name in vain. We celebrate pagan holidays like Christmas, Valentine&#39;s Day and Fourth of July.  They let us believe the world is just a small speck in a dead universe. They told us the messiah was nailed to a cross. He wasn&#39;t! They have failed us!</p>

The church is within us. </p>

<p>And remember Revelation 3:9</p>

<p>Behold, I will make them of the synagogue of Satan, which say they are Jews, and are not, but do lie; behold, I will make them to come and worship before thy feet, and to know that I have loved thee.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t have a clue? We have been lied to and indoctrinated to worship and know all these Babylonia and Egyptian deities. But I don&#39;t have a clue? You think Satan would let you know the Messiah true name? You think Satan would let you know how to worship YAHUWA? You even think he was hung from a cross. Research it! Look it up! With eyes that are not tinged with what your parents believe or the government tells you. I am clueless though? I can&#39;t be lied to. That&#39;s the only difference between me and you. I&#39;m not special or anointed. I&#39;m a nobody. And it didn&#39;t take me long to come to the truth either. Instead of fighting someone who will not hit back, try to prove me wrong with scripture. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I hope I am wrong. I prayed that I was wrong. It&#39;s not my will at work. It is God&#39;s will. I can&#39;t do anything. I was shown I could not save one life. Not one life.
