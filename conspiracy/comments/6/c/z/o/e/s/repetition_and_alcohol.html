        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The easiest forms of mind control. As yourself this- how easy is it to convince someone to do something while under the influence of alcohol? How easy are pop songs stuck in heads while drunk? Try reading next time you&#39;re buzzed, you&#39;ll start repeating yourself I promise. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve heard that the most basic form of mind control is repetition, alcohol is an easy lubricant to the conditions of humans and their emotions. It&#39;s why it&#39;s legal and abused, getting people emotionally attached to concerts, sporting events, sexual promiscuity.. small thought I&#39;m on mobile and wanted to talk about something other than us politics so I propose you this - </p>

<p>Is alcohol regulated and okay to use because TPTB know the influence when used in a proper mind control manner? Do they use this drug to soften the minds of the masses?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve the most &quot;woken&quot; moments under the influence of alcohol. I believe it affects people differently, and state of mind is a huge factor. I&#39;m currently under the influence of alcohol. It&#39;s a tool, same as any substance. Can be used for good or bad. Just my two cents.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the real conspiracy is in the TPTB fixation on alcohol and banning of other things.</p>

<p>cannabis has no place being a schedule 1 drug, it really is better than alcohol IMO.</p>

<p>Mushrooms really shouldn&#39;t be illegal, depending on climate, there&#39;s no sound way to regulate a naturally growing fungus. I had a bad time with LSD, but I&#39;ve seen enough good stories to know it&#39;s all about being responsible regardless of choice.</p>

<p>I feel differently about heroin, cocaine, and other more processed drugs, but addiction is a disease, not a crime. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I see what you mean.</p>

<p>Although in terms of long term damage, we can measure the damage caused by alcohol and cocaine and we really can&#39;t do that with psychedelics.</p>

<p>Cocaine is another drug that I would consider more natural because it&#39;s a chemical you can find by chewing a coca plant.  Stimulants by nature can cause more measurable damage.</p>

<p>Psychs just affect the way you think.  -Could be good or bad, and the thing is you won&#39;t really know until after you take it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you are slamming Busch lights at a sports bar, and a blithering drunk engages you in a politically biased 2 party conversation, yes alcohol becomes an inhibitor. However, if you find yourself amongst fellow intellectuals who are evolved enough to not take offense at a conflicting opinion that may seemingly threaten their beliefs system, then there is an opportunity there to exchange ideas with love and acceptance. It&#39;s like any other scenario. I&#39;m the last one to uote the Bible, but don&#39;t cast your pearls before swine. We are all eager to do that it seems in an online setting. I and the people I love all have great concern for the state of the reality we live in. Sometimes we have conflicting opinions but I love them enough, and they love me enough to remove themselves from their supposedly sacred beliefs, and for a short while, Dawn another belief. And understand the basis, and the foundation for such a point of view. When an exchange like that takes place, a sacred thing occurs. Mutual Understanding.</p>

<p>In my opinion the strongest fine of society is the true heart of mankind. The basic idea that an average, decent human being wants not only good for himself and those that he loves, but that he is able to realize that those around him no matter how seemingly different at times, desire the same thing. We want to smile, we love good music, we want to share with our neighbors, we want good not only for ourselves but for all. These thoughts and ideas can be achieved by man no Matter the influence his mind may be under. It is determined by his beliefs, and the individuals and thoughts he consciously decides to expose himself to. 
Don&#39;t bother knocking on a door you know you will be turned away from give your heart and mind to those you know who are at least willing to see you for what you are. Another human being. With faults and beautiful qualities and possibilities the same as they are.</p>

<p>I am here all the time. Reading these things. These posts. And as I sit here, under the influence nonetheless, I just want you all to know that I love you. From Uzbekestan, to New Jersey, to fucking Baghdad. We all love all our families and friends and just wish for a happy life and existence. Let us strive for that by not lashing out at those that we perceive as different or adverse. But let us embrace those who may believe differently, but I  the end we have more in common with than differences. As some would have us believe.</p>

<p>We are all beautifully flawed, and I will try my best to love as many of you as I can. And I hope we can all try to do that. Fkng Namaste damnit... I love you all...</p>
