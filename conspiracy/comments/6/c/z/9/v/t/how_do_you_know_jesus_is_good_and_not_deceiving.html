Ive been exploring how many mythologies retell the same thing using different names, Nimrod is Osiris, Saturn, Chronus, Shiva, and so on. Horus is Osiris&#39; son, who is the embodiment of Atum, and the Pharaoh which to me sounds a lot like Jesus Christ. However Nimrod was from Ham and not Shem. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>See this to me mean that the Black Cube of Saturn (Nimrod/Osiris/Chronus/Ba&#39;al/Gilgamesh/Shiva) was destroyed or changed into the Cross of Jesus. Although I believe it is implying that the Cube was of the Old Testament God, which is different from the New Testament God according to the Gnostics. The thing though is Yahweh is always telling the Hebrew people to stop worshipping Ba&#39;al, and if Yahweh is the Demiurge, then that would make Ba&#39;al the good guy. </p>

<p>You probably shouldn&#39;t use that kind of logic, sorry, it&#39;s just too slippery and careless. Baal is not the good guy, there are no good guys amongst these godlike entities you&#39;re researching. Just because Yahweh is a jealous god that commands his people to only worship him doesn&#39;t mean lesser gods are good guys. They all want sacrifice and blood though. Generally vampiric.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No you misunderstand The Babylonian Mysteries worship Nimrod not Jesus, they hate Jesus because they view Christianity as a perversion. Im saying that the Babylonian Mysteries are very similar to the ancient mythologies of ancient civilizations like Egypt and Greece, in which they portray the Osiris as the Lightbringer and his brother Set as the adversary. Christianity reverses this, to say that Set is Jesus and Osiris is Satan. I know it can be confusing, that is why I am asking for clarification. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well I agree with you in terms of accepting the Old Testament. However it is the New Testament that I was saying has inverted this religion of Nimrod. Anyhow, Ive come to think that these pagan religions, all of which tell the same story just differently, are all Satanic.

    <div class="md"><p>Jesus&#39; arrival on earth was prophesied many times in the Old testament.  I still don&#39;t know what you mean by &quot;inverted&quot;.  God dismissed Nimrod and the Tower of Babel as a symbol of false worship - nothing more or less than that.  How do you invert false worship?  Satan was around long before Nimrod, and long after him.  Satan rules the world with God&#39;s allowance - because God wants to prove His sovereignty (that Satan cannot rule the world to man&#39;s satisfaction).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He warned about the moneylenders, was betrayed by judas (who sold him out for &gt;gold coins&lt;), spoke about how &#39;truth will set you free&#39; (as opposed to believing in lies and going with the brainwashed majority who have been deceived by darkness) and warned about being &#39;divided&#39;. Jesus was redpilled as hell.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How very odd that you refer to the One True God as a &quot;rival anunuki&quot;.  Your false premise is enough to discount your entire question. Only the old and new testaments are authorized to speak truth from God.  What is most likely is you are deceived by the lies of the evil one. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I died and my spirit is hanging out with Jesus. I came back to earth and this life after drowning when I was 8. The &quot;real&quot; me, the pure child spirit, is already home. My consciousness is driving this avatar body in this earth realm. </p>

<p>So, I pray and meditate and hang out with Jesus and little Aders on the shores of earth constantly. Jesus is light and life. That&#39;s all I know.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No you misunderstand The Babylonian Mysteries worship Nimrod not Jesus, they hate Jesus because they view Christianity as a perversion. Im saying that the Babylonian Mysteries are very similar to the ancient mythologies of ancient civilizations like Egypt and Greece, in which they portray the Osiris as the Lightbringer and his brother Set as the adversary. Christianity reverses this, to say that Set is Jesus and Osiris is Satan. I know it can be confusing, that is why I am asking for clarification. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Where are you getting your information from? </p>

<p>Nimrod....a grandson of Noah, born in Ethiopia.  Becomes an Emporer...people worship him, he demands a tower built for him (Tower of Babel)...God disapproves of this, and confuses people by making them speak different languages...they disperse, taking with them the &quot;Babylon Mystery religion&quot; (false religion) with them....</p>

<p>How does all of the above relate to Jesus? </p>

<p>Why do you elevate Nimrod (a dicator) to such a high level?</p>
