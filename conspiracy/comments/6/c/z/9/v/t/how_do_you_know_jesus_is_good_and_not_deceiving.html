       Nimrod created Babylon and wanted to build the Tower of Babel. The Illuminati practice his occult teachings. Ive been exploring how many mythologies retell the same thing using different names, Nimrod is Osiris, Saturn, Chronus, Shiva, and so on. Horus is Osiris' son, who is the embodiment of Atum, and the Pharaoh which to me sounds a lot like Jesus Christ. However Nimrod was from Ham and not Shem.

       Because Gnosticism. Check out the Nag Hammadi library which wasn't discovered until 1945. It's critical. I believe the New Testament is manipulated based on what is in the gnostic texts.

       I was thinking the same thing actually, the Nag Hammadi library is similar to the myths of the ancient world and much older than the New Testament. Either way I believe christianity has been co-opted by the Vatican to continue worshipping Nimrod and his wife mother Samiramis.

       How could he be bad? What's the worst thing he did? Lose his temper with the moneychangers in the temple? Offered a couple harsh parables to people who don't like being told this material world is shallow bullshit?

      <p>
       Jesus Christ is my Lord and Savior and if people here don't want to join me on that side of the fence, it's cool, I'm not big on evangelism. But the man basically told everybody to chill out, love your neighbor, don't obsess over material gain.

       The whole point of believing in God is faith.  God wants you to come to Him.  That's impossible if He comes to you via empirical evidence.  You seek empirical evidence, not faith.  You're comparing an apple to an orange, and complaining they are different.

As the veil of the Temple fell aside it exposed the black cube of the Old Covenant –the Yahweh Covenant- which at this most momentous time split along its sides and opened out in the form of a cross."

       See this to me mean that the Black Cube of Saturn (Nimrod/Osiris/Chronus/Ba'al/Gilgamesh/Shiva) was destroyed or changed into the Cross of Jesus. Although I believe it is implying that the Cube was of the Old Testament God, which is different from the New Testament God according to the Gnostics. The thing though is Yahweh is always telling the Hebrew people to stop worshipping Ba'al, and if Yahweh is the Demiurge, then that would make Ba'al the good guy.

ba'al is ba'alzebub.  It is not a good entity.

       You probably shouldn't use that kind of logic, sorry, it's just too slippery and careless. Baal is not the good guy, there are no good guys amongst these godlike entities you're researching. Just because Yahweh is a jealous god that commands his people to only worship him doesn't mean lesser gods are good guys. They all want sacrifice and blood though. Generally vampiric.

       Yes, they worship Nimrod by performing child sacrifice, blood drinking,  what the christians would call satanic. All the ancient mythologies practice these things, look at the Inca or the Egyptians.

       No you misunderstand The Babylonian Mysteries worship Nimrod not Jesus, they hate Jesus because they view Christianity as a perversion. Im saying that the Babylonian Mysteries are very similar to the ancient mythologies of ancient civilizations like Egypt and Greece, in which they portray the Osiris as the Lightbringer and his brother Set as the adversary. Christianity reverses this, to say that Set is Jesus and Osiris is Satan. I know it can be confusing, that is why I am asking for clarification.

       Nimrod....a grandson of Noah, born in Ethiopia.

       The Mystery Babylon religion is what Nimrod created, and in it he places himself as the Sun god. Then all of these people who are scattered tell the same story but it is different because they don't speak the same languages. Christianity takes this story and inverts it. It is not Nimrod who is God, but he is Satan.

       You have to believe in the Genesis narrative to give Nimrod any significance.  And if you do, then you believe in the bible narrative.  Otherwise, Nimrod wasn't Noah's grandson, and the whole thing about the flood, about Adam and Eve - you somehow have to "not believe all of that", yet believe the bit in the bible about Nimrod being an Emporer.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why do you say "inverts it"? Why are you believing some parts of the bible, but not others?

       Well I agree with you in terms of accepting the Old Testament. However it is the New Testament that I was saying has inverted this religion of Nimrod. Anyhow, Ive come to think that these pagan religions, all of which tell the same story just differently, are all Satanic. However I also believe that the Vatican is worshipping Nimrod, as the Pope dresses like him and there is a ton of solar imagery and the dove is symbolic of the fire dragon.

       Jesus' arrival on earth was prophesied many times in the Old testament.  I still don't know what you mean by "inverted".  God dismissed Nimrod and the Tower of Babel as a symbol of false worship - nothing more or less than that.  How do you invert false worship?  Satan was around long before Nimrod, and long after him.  Satan rules the world with God's allowance - because God wants to prove His sovereignty (that Satan cannot rule the world to man's satisfaction).

       He warned about the moneylenders, was betrayed by judas (who sold him out for &gt;gold coins&lt;), spoke about how 'truth will set you free' (as opposed to believing in lies and going with the brainwashed majority who have been deceived by darkness) and warned about being 'divided'.

       How very odd that you refer to the One True God as a "rival anunuki".  Your false premise is enough to discount your entire question. Only the old and new testaments are authorized to speak truth from God.  What is most likely is you are deceived by the lies of the evil one.
