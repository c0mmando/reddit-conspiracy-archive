       Holy Fuck... Could you imagine.. Complete censorship would have been almost certain..
      </p>
      <p>
       u/spez: Since when did being Anti-Clinton become being a trump supporter?? Sounds like artificial division.. Also people keep trying to convince us that Hillary doesn't matter anymore... That's pretty fucked up considering her along with the help of the corrupt democratic establishment essentially lead us to a Trump presidency and republican ,one party controlled, government.. Sounds pretty heavy to me.. I don't think the Democratic Base is just going to "forget" what happened..

       No. It's a pointless, agenda driven post designed to distract us and keep us mad at irrelevant Hillary instead of the incompetent orange goon and the soulless GOP that are actually in power right now.

       No one here would argue with that, it's just that one side has complete power right now, in every seat of government, and the other is weaker and largely irrelevant.

       Great response, care to elaborate? Maybe you can share your thoughts on the manfactured content of r/all for the past 4 months? How does that content compared to R/all from years past?? Do you see any agendas? Is Reddit gamed? Please do discuss, let's show some more effort shall we??

       You're very wrong. It's almost certain that if Hillary won she would have delivered her inauguration speech naked while sitting on a unicorn.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hillary didn't win. Who fucking cares what might have happened? President Hillary didn't bomb Syria. President Hillary didn't appoint a cabinet full of swamp monsters. President Hillary didn't swing her dick around North Korea. President Hillary didn't appoint Chelsea and her husband as advisors. President Hillary hasn't attacked the freedom of the press. President Hillary didn't give billions of dollars to the Israelis and then make a deal worth hundreds of billions with a terrorist state to carry out more war crimes with. Might she have done those things if she had won? Probably. But she didn't win. Trump did. Trump won on a litany of lies. What Hillary might have done is irrelevant. Trump is the President. Trump is reality and the reality is he is no different to Clinton, you just don't want to face it.

       Ha kid.. The problem with post like yours is that your so narrow minded to believe that fellow free thinkers are trump supporters. Actually, out of ALL 3 candidates we were forced with, I chose the stand behind who I thought was the best HUMAN BEING. I, like majority of America, stayed home on election night. Your post is sounds more like division tactics.
      </p>
      <p>
       I like many here don't give 2 FUCKS about sides nor puppet politicians. My post is 100% fact. We all seen the suppression CTR and MSM was pushing. It was straight up censorship. Opinion suppression by shilling.
      </p>
      <p>
       The front page 1 year ago is not the front page it is now. If the shills are still trying to push their propaganda when it's obviously failed, could you imagine what the front page would look like if their propaganda worked?

       Trump supporter or not, why continue to bitch &amp; moan about Hillary?  She lost.  She's out of the game.  She's gone.

       Soo in conclusion, Hillary Cliton and Democratic Establishment waged everything on "crushing trump". It back fired hard and now the people of the United States is left with President Trump and a republican Controlled Government. I'm pretty sure my statement is clear and direct as possible. Please do Correct The Record if you'd like.

       Your statement is clear, and I don't disagree with the above statement, but I still think bitching about Hillary is absolutely pointless at this point.  Eat sour grapes all day long if you so choose, but posting about it makes it a shitpost.

       "Historically incompetent"? Seeing as how the current President hasn't even been in office six months, that sounds like shill speak to me. Frankly, I'm more worried about the shadow government mobilizing the media to spew propaganda non-stop, working to neuter the office of the presidency itself, and effectively eliminating the checks and balances built into our system, and, by extension, our right to self-governance, but hey, that's just me. HURR DRR DRAGNALD DDRUPF!!!

       He's literally done nothing but embarass the country, fuck over the lower and middle class, and aligned himself with everything he campaigned against.

       I absolutely agree with you, it would be passed off as being anti American and the subs would be brigaded and shut down.

      <p>
       Clinton conspired and rigged the primary against Sanders, then attempted to blackmail Americans into voting for her because they elevated trump to be the opposition and look at the landscape now days, democrats are demolished from coast to coast and yet the leadership is allowed to retain power.

       Trump supporter or not, why continue to bitch &amp; moan about Hillary?  She lost.  She's out of the game.  She's gone.
