       Here's the message from someone who lives in England:
      </p>
      <p>
       Things are going to get really shit here after Brexit. Workers rights will be going out of the window (which is why so many business owners funded UKIP) around the same time that the welfare system changes even more for the worse, forcing people into horrible situations where they're working all hours for what converts to not a lot. I think after the EU residents are gone, the massive amounts of agricultural work (fruit and veg picking for starters) will be 'offered' to British people (to be taken unless they want sanctions). I even think they'll start building accommodation for them to stay the season. I think there's going to be a clampdown on the drug black market as well for a couple of reasons (they're really pushing the 'we didn't get searched' angle after the Manchester incident btw) which is a means of survival for lots of people but also a massive amount of money swilling about that May and the like would prefer to see going elsewhere. You just cannot live on benefits alone, it's basically impossible already. Hence the foodbanks. I'm expecting drugs tests for dole-claimers too as Australia is just bringing in. I have a few more predictions but I won't bore you with them all. I made a post the other day (deleted) about this with regards to Mays statement about the 'new' internet she wants with restrictions on what can be posted etc. I think this is all about stopping communication and organisation precisely because they don't want a repeat of the London riots with even more people. They also don't want protests. Protests give people an idea of how not-alone they are. The riots also showed what just a few chavs could do with no real direction. Watch this vid from about the 17min mark. I really think they're expecting it and they know why.

       ...People that care about their fellow humans, those of us that have compassion and empathy?
      </p>
      <p>
       Lol...yet your next comment is "why didn't they do something about it." With all the media propaganda, establishment money and resources spent on dividing us from one another based on bullshit (race, class, politics, any/all differences are exploited), stifling information flow by restricting free speech and the internet, discouraging activism, not to mention increasingly lower wages that increase the difficulty of making an honest living...well, it's obvious why the people didn't "do something to stop it."

       Some are ignorant, many are fearful, most are exhausted. Each of only has so much energy and time to devote to things both within and without, the harder you have to work to support yourself and your family, the less you have to spare to educate yourself on issues, let alone acting on them.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know whether to laugh or cry that people like you still exist.

       They were duped or spurred on by the racism that was grown in order to dehumanise and demonise all muslims in order to get the public to support the oil wars .  Also, complacency on the part of a lot of people like myself who just assumed there weren't that many idiots and that enough other people would go out and vote stay.

       Lets get this clear. 52%
       <em>
        of the eligible public
       </em>
       voted to leave the EU.  If you take into consideration the 28% of the public who didn't vote (or, to put it another way - were happy with the way things were), you get figures that 37% of the eligible public voted to leave, and 63% either voted to remain, or didn't want a change.

       You can't extrapolate that people who didn't vote were happy with how things were, at best you can extrapolate that they weren't bothered about whether or not we left the EU. The only people you can say were happy with the status quo were those who voted remain.

       Weren't bothered about whether or not we left the EU means they must have been happy with the way things were, no? Otherwise they'd have got up and voted to leave...

       Not necessarily. Many people didn't feel informed enough to make the decision, but were unhappy with the current state of the EU, many were unhappy with the current EU-UK relationship but were worried about the implications of a hard Brexit and many were just apathetic. If you assume apathy means happiness with the status quo are you just going to lump non-voters with the governing party at elections?

       I think with elections a non-vote is a non-vote - there isn't a simple yes or no answer.
      </p>
      <p>
       OK, I agree that there were people unhappy with the current state of the EU, or not informed enough to make a decision - however I'm not sure they made up the the nearly 13 million non-voters. Quite a chunk of those I'm willing to bet would have been "we'll never leave, there's no point in me voting" or "I can't be bothered".
      </p>
      <p>
       The referendum should have been a one-answer deal. You go to vote if you want to leave the EU. That's it.

       No vote is a wasted vote. You may feel so, but it's not true. You vote for who you want, and everyone else can vote for who they want, and we can all have another utterly unrepresentative parliament for the next four years.

       They rose 9 points in a week, giving polls are over-correcting for May's Tory's as they failed to account for shy Corbynites replacing shy Labour that's far too close for them to be confident of winning, as 9 points in another week would put them neck and neck. Whilst this terror attack is not a false flag event, it's certainly convenient for the Conservatives - who are always seen as stronger on national security and terrorism.

       T'was me.  I wouldn't say 'on the brink' exactly but I really feel there's going to be civil unrest in the not too distant future.  I think this is connected to Mays 'new' internet.  Cambridge Analytica just demonstrated perfectly what you can do with all that
       <a href="https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/big-data-cambridge-analytica-brexit-trump">
        Facebook data,
       </a>
       also running the Brexit Leave internet campaign and the general consensus seems to be that this kind of info also allows predictions about peoples behaviour as well as the ability to 'sway' them.  Think about all that in the context of a tightly contolled internet where your data isn't going to be wasted anonymously on sites like 4chan (or indeed if you're using a VPN - in fact I wouldn't be surprised if a VPN features in the Manchester story at some point).  It will become nearly impossible to organise protests without being headed off before you even board a train or bus.  In fact, it could become difficult to even post anything that smells slightly of activism.
I forgot to mention, police officers have been using
       <a href="http://www.theargus.co.uk/news/15300337.Low_paid_police_officers_resorting_to_food_banks/">
        foodbanks.
