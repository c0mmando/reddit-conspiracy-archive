    <div class="md"><p>I though about giving up for some time, but that&#39;s exactly what those trying to drive you away want. When r/politics pulled a 180 after the convention, I left, as my comments and posts that would receive a positive reception in the months before were now being downvoted and ridiculed. Afterwards I found other subreddit communities to join, and eventually made my way to r/conspiracy after the events of mid October surrounding Wikileaks. Now that r/sandersforpresident is up and running I&#39;ve been back and reading daily, however there are new mods and there is a heavy hand developing gradually on certain discussion topics, with entire comment threads with many upvotes being removed. An example would be a comment thread on Comey and his treatment of Hillary&#39;s server investigation, which was silenced despite 36 upvotes. I argued with the mod over its removal, and discovered on the same night that some of my comments, even from a month ago, had been removed without notification, but I refuse to give up now like I did then. Don&#39;t care about the downvotes, don&#39;t care about what people are pretending is normal. If you&#39;re getting downvotes for stating your opinion in a sub that would have happily received that opinion months prior, realize that you are fighting manufactured consensus. The vast majority of those subs users still agree with you, but they don&#39;t have the money or time to hire shills to guard the new que and against threatening discussion all day. </p>

<p>All of this is to say that you need to fight NOW. Even something as small as commenting despite the downvotes and stating your opinion is a worthy contribution, regardless of your politics. In the words of the German pastor and poet Martin Niemoller: &quot; First they came for the Socialists, and I did not speak out, because I was not a socialists, then they came for the trade unionists, and I did not speak out, because I was not a trade unionist, then they came for the Jews, and I did not speak out, because I was not a Jew, then they came for me, and there was no one left to speak for me&quot; </p>

<p>Comment, accept the downvotes, and don&#39;t let them drive you away from the community you were a part of long before they decided to try and destroy it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You ain&#39;t alone. I have been slowly checking out of here for a while. People can&#39;t seem to disagree anymore. This sub has lost it&#39;s previous sense of balance. This last election seems to have brought in a certain vitriol and people can&#39;t seem to get over themselves like before. </p>

<p>I actually get the sense that people are literally <em>angry</em> when they engage with people here now, something that I never, ever felt here before, even in previous elections it wasn&#39;t like this. I still don&#39;t get upset or angry with people, but the vitriol is a lot more pervasive lately. </p>

<p>Before, it was like people had their favorite conspiracies and even though all people did not buy into all conspiracies, you could at least engage and ask questions and allow yourself to <em>consider</em> all the evidence and appreciate the efforts put forth. <em>People used to allow themselves to be persuaded by a good case..</em> </p>

<p>It is just too tense and political here now, people seem to even dislike people simply because they do not agree with them, that NEVER used to be the case here. </p>

<p>I think this last election and the large influx from T_D has changed the culture of this sub.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Seems more obvious there is a swath of people here who believe Russia hacked the election and that r/T_D has just moved here to talk about Seth Rich. Oh, and we&#39;re all alt-right for pointing out the coincidences surrounding the Rich thing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>FUCK VOAT</p>

<p>how is it better? Have you heard of Patriot Act? Can you give me a rundown of what it does? What enables the intelligence agencies?</p>

<p>and secondly, i don&#39;t buy this whole russia thing. it&#39;s a cold war all over again and the only reason is money and power. it has shit all to do with wars, threats or fucking election.</p>

<p>I see 0 motive for russians to hack usa elections and i see dozens of proof cia has capability to do just that</p>

<p>so which is more probable?</p>
