       Some people argue that Putin is in fact an Anti-NWO leader, others say he is on his own side and couldn't care less, others say he is controlled by the Zionist. Personally I've always been confused about him and was glad about the US-Russia peace for a while but things went to hell. Jews also have a long history in Russia which is why I've always been skeptical about him.

       IMO, he is either wittingly or unwittingly under the control of the Eastern Cabal. Both the East and West cabals are controlled by a third unknown cabal. Some say aliens, I do not. I think they are Ancients who live for hundreds if not thousands of years.

       That's not true. Banking is a big part, but not the most important part, imo. Have you ever heard of the Tri-Sovereign States?

       There's no use in labeling it. We know where the banks are located. They are mainly in The City of London and Wall Street. That is where our enemies are; don't get confused with semantics.

       BIS is in Switzerland, the mother of all central banks which flows it's money into the Vatican Bank. The East has a different system, on the front. But it all gets funneled back into the third hidden cabal, imo. Methinks you need to dig dipper, young grasshopper.

       You might assume that public opinion has 0 effect on what these politicians do, but then why is the media of such importance to tptb? Truth is, if 'the good guys' thought they had enough people to back them up, there'd be thousands of whistleblowers and dissenters tomorrow.

       You must look at Putin's actions in context. Why does he seem to be having to work so hard to nationalize Russia's industries and maintain his trading ports?
      </p>
      <p>
       The answer is that after the collapse of Soviet Union, which was accomplished through Bush Sr's fraudulent bond scheme, billions of dollars were flown out of JFK airport to a vast organized crime network in post-Soviet regions.
      </p>
      <p>
       To this day black market leaders like Semion Mogilevich, and all those Eastern European Oligarchs, take orders from Western Banks. For example, Mogilevich funnels all of his money through

        Bank of New York
       </a>
       . This is why

        ISIS gets a majority of their Cold War-era weapons

       of humans, organs, and weapons.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is hard to say what exactly Putin would do if he wasn't having to retake Russia from criminals and wasn't fighting neo-nazi militias in Ukraine

       Very good comment. George Soros gets lots of publicity, but he's just one little piece of the picture. There is ONE MAIN REASON that the United States and Russia are not on good terms, and it is

       -- US anti-Russia policy which has been followed ever since. This will make an excellent addition to your deep knowledge if you have not seen it before. :)
      </p>
      <p>
       Regarding the more general question concerning the quality of Vladimir Putin -- he's a thug. Back in 2000 after he was exposed for the "apartment block bombings," people wanted him out of there. They changed their minds as the US agenda to isolate and destroy Russia took precedence.

       Thats a very interesting document, thanks. I'd say this anti-Russia animosity is also very much caused by the threat of the Silk Road to Western trade systems. This train of thought can be found in Halford Mackinder's Heartland Theory in 1904, which was pretty significant for British foreign policy, and then restated by Brzezinski in "The Grand Chessboard." They both essentially believed that we need to keep knocking down the countries along the Eurasian plains to maintain London's authority.
      </p>
      <p>
       In my opinion Putin is less of a thug than Mogilevich or Soros. I don't know anything about the apartment bombings however.
      </p>
      <p>
       But honestly, I think all of our animosity needs to be focused on the banks and the regimes of the Gulf States, not on Putin just yet.

       For sure. Russia has always been targeted. The 1992 Defense Planning Guidance that I linked is great because it is not only the first major policy document after the cold War, it is an official document. This is stuff that cannot be denied.

       So, he wants to fight ISIS, engage in peaceful cooperation for trade in Asia, and fought people like Bush and Obama... and you think he's "NWO"?

       Cryptically speaking, it started last month, things should pick up pretty quickly from here on out. O' you'll get your "peaceful cooperation" for sure, but thats the temporary last great lie. There, thats as far as I'll debate this complex issue, but for the most part your right about how he is positioning himself and Russia.
