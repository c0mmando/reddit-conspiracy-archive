<p>That&#39;s not true. Banking is a big part, but not the most important part, imo. Have you ever heard of the Tri-Sovereign States?</p>

<p>Take down ISIS? Sounds good to me.</p>

<p>Take back Russia&#39;s industries from organized crime and finance large infrastructure with neighboring countries, especially China? That would be good for the citizens of that area, so sounds good.</p>

<p>Supporting a politician isn&#39;t how <a href="/r/thedonald">/r/thedonald</a> makes it look. You don&#39;t call someone &quot;emperor&quot; and ignore their flaws. You give them credit when it&#39;s due and encourage them to act righteously. </p>

<p>You might assume that public opinion has 0 effect on what these politicians do, but then why is the media of such importance to tptb? Truth is, if &#39;the good guys&#39; thought they had enough people to back them up, there&#39;d be thousands of whistleblowers and dissenters tomorrow.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You must look at Putin&#39;s actions in context. Why does he seem to be having to work so hard to nationalize Russia&#39;s industries and maintain his trading ports?</p>

<p>The answer is that after the collapse of Soviet Union, which was accomplished through Bush Sr&#39;s fraudulent bond scheme, billions of dollars were flown out of JFK airport to a vast organized crime network in post-Soviet regions.</p>

<p>To this day black market leaders like Semion Mogilevich, and all those Eastern European Oligarchs, take orders from Western Banks. For example, Mogilevich funnels all of his money through <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1999/09/11/world/reputed-russian-mobster-denies-tie-to-laundering-and-takes-umbrage.html">Bank of New York</a>. This is why <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/27/weapons-flowing-eastern-europe-middle-east-revealed-arms-trade-syria">ISIS gets a majority of their Cold War-era weapons</a> from the Balkans, where Dyncorp was previously trafficking <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Whistleblower">huge quantities</a> of humans, organs, and weapons.</p>

<p>It is hard to say what exactly Putin would do if he wasn&#39;t having to retake Russia from criminals and wasn&#39;t fighting neo-nazi militias in Ukraine <a href="http://larouchepub.com/pr/2017/Xproof%20Nazis%20in%20Ukraine.pdf">financed by Soros</a>, but he is currently America&#39;s ally practically.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Very good comment. George Soros gets lots of publicity, but he&#39;s just one little piece of the picture. There is ONE MAIN REASON that the United States and Russia are not on good terms, and it is <a href="http://nsarchive.gwu.edu/nukevault/ebb245/doc03_extract_nytedit.pdf">here</a> -- US anti-Russia policy which has been followed ever since. This will make an excellent addition to your deep knowledge if you have not seen it before. :)</p>

<p>Regarding the more general question concerning the quality of Vladimir Putin -- he&#39;s a thug. Back in 2000 after he was exposed for the &quot;apartment block bombings,&quot; people wanted him out of there. They changed their minds as the US agenda to isolate and destroy Russia took precedence. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thats a very interesting document, thanks. I&#39;d say this anti-Russia animosity is also very much caused by the threat of the Silk Road to Western trade systems. This train of thought can be found in Halford Mackinder&#39;s Heartland Theory in 1904, which was pretty significant for British foreign policy, and then restated by Brzezinski in &quot;The Grand Chessboard.&quot; They both essentially believed that we need to keep knocking down the countries along the Eurasian plains to maintain London&#39;s authority.</p>

<p>In my opinion Putin is less of a thug than Mogilevich or Soros. I don&#39;t know anything about the apartment bombings however.</p>

<p>But honestly, I think all of our animosity needs to be focused on the banks and the regimes of the Gulf States, not on Putin just yet.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>For sure. Russia has always been targeted. The 1992 Defense Planning Guidance that I linked is great because it is not only the first major policy document after the cold War, it is an official document. This is stuff that cannot be denied.</p>

<p>I just posted it as a submission. These major documents have to be thrown back out there for anyone who may have missed them -- including the PNAC document. :)</p>

<p>Not to get into any kind of debate on this subject matter, I firmly believe he is full throttle NWO, the illusion may say otherwise at times, but he is in on it, for the world peace lie.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So, he wants to fight ISIS, engage in peaceful cooperation for trade in Asia, and fought people like Bush and Obama... and you think he&#39;s &quot;NWO&quot;?</p>

<p>Cryptically speaking, it started last month, things should pick up pretty quickly from here on out. O&#39; you&#39;ll get your &quot;peaceful cooperation&quot; for sure, but thats the temporary last great lie. There, thats as far as I&#39;ll debate this complex issue, but for the most part your right about how he is positioning himself and Russia.</p>
