    <div class="md"><p>It really is worth reading.  I can paste a few snippets though.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>People of America, it still seems to me that the officials in your government are still lying to you and are not giving you true explanations of the reasons that led them to embark on their aggression against Iraq. In what they have said about the reasons they have deceived, from the starting point, not only the international community, and in particular the European Community but also the peoples of America themselves, knowing beforehand that the facts were contrary to what they were declaring. Untrue is what they said, after their lies were exposed, about having been deceived by their intelligence agencies and by the stooges that they brought along to serve as their puppets in Iraq, just as old imperialism and the old empires of the 19th and 20th centuries used to do. What we are saying is based on many facts, the major ones being as follows: </p>

<ol>
<li>The inspection teams – that came to Iraq in the name of the United Nations and carried out searches even of some private houses as well as government departments, presidential palaces and government documents – those teams knew that Iraq had no weapons of mass destruction because most of the leading members in those teams were Americans and British and in addition they had spies and volunteers of other nationalities.
He goes on to mention how America used 9/11 as a pretext to attack Iraq even though they had the plan in place before 9/11. </li>
</ol>

<p>None of the Americans asked their government before the war how Iraq, a country that had still not emerged from backwardness, could threaten the security of a country like America across the Atlantic. And for that matter why would Iraq want to threaten America, which at that time had not violated the territory of Iraq.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Really though, it is a long read.  But it does paint an interesting picture and one that has shown itself to be more accurate as time has gone on than it was believed to be at the time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow! The hoops you have to jump through to get there. When they are expressing truths about the systemic corruption in the American political machine it indicates that we were programmed to see them as ruthless dictators. Iraq was a thriving state in the 70&#39;s and 80&#39;s before we invaded them because Saddam was going to stop trading oil with the Federal Reserve Note and start only accepting Gold, something that actually has inherent value. This massively undermines the Rothschild fiat currency banking scheme that has oppressed the entire world under its fraudulent debt system. If you look into all of the countries we have had military conflicts with in the last 50 years you will find that all of them didn&#39;t have a Rothschild (Zionist) central bank. The Zionists then construct a narrative about how the &quot;dictator&quot; is evil and oppressive, when really they are simply refusing to have their countries resources stolen from them through fraud. Usually the CIA creates or supports some type of false flag, which they then use to complete the programming on the citizens which gives them the support they need to invade and conquer.</p>

<p>There are literally mountains of evidence supporting this, hundreds of declassified CIA and other government documents, statements from politicians, statements from the leaders of the invaded state. I&#39;m not going to spend a bunch of my time doing research for you to provide sources, but I would recommend checking out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/corbettreport">https://www.youtube.com/user/corbettreport</a>  I would sort his videos by most viewed and watch some of the top ones. He has sources for everything in the description and covers a wide swath of the total puzzle, though admittedly not the entire thing.</p>
