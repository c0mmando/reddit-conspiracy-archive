       I find it extremely troubling that pizzagate is becoming more &amp; more of a possible reality as the days go by.
      </p>
      <p>
       News outlets across the US are calling it fake news while platforms across the web are censoring all they can on the matter.
      </p>
      <p>
       Am I right to assume something is going on, even if it's not EXACTLY what we think is going on? Why censor the smoke if there's no fire?

       And let me guess, you feel guilty because you think, "those kids went through it and I get upset just reading about it. Why can't I be braver"? Don't give into that way of thinking, either. Be sure to forgive yourself and let go of that guilt. I'm still working on that.

       Time will help, I promise. It's okay to know you've done your contribution and walk away from the subject. The best way of fighting back against this darkness is to live in the light. To love. If everyone did this problem would no longer exist.

       remember that the DNC leak also led to the whole Pizzagate revolution... it was in the leak that all the funny language in Podesta's emails was first noticed. If Seth Rich was the Wikileaks source, it also means he more or less 'created' Pizzagate as well...

       I know too many adults who have been sexually assaulted &amp; I must say there's nothing worse that can happen to you in IMO. It's just way harder to swallow whenever I'm reminded it's possibly kids who are being subjected to the worst mental trauma.

       You're kind of proving the point. If they truly considered pizzagate ludicrous, then they would ignore it (like your cloud people analogy). However, the MSM and internet outlets went to extreme lengths to either censor information or claim that it is crazy and debunked without ever addressing the more compelling evidence

       They did ignore it. Then someone went and opened fire in a restaurant and it became news.

       Okay, that's just not true. You can easily google articles that were written well before that happened. The pizzagate sub was also shut down before then.

       Most news agencies paid it very little attention until the Comet shooting. Yes there were exceptions, but largely from either conservative news that kinda wanted to promote it or from sources that were exploring the incredible anti-Clinton hate machine. There was little from the mainstream about it.

       That's somewhat correct. As pizzagate kept gaining popularity online, the MSM finally started to respond in November (which also coincided with the creation of the "fake news" moniker being thrown around everywhere). Here's one example from the New York Times:
       <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/21/technology/fact-check-this-pizzeria-is-not-a-child-trafficking-site.html?_r=0">
        https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/21/technology/fact-check-this-pizzeria-is-not-a-child-trafficking-site.html?_r=0
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       The New York Times isn't conservative, obviously, and no MSM outlets "kinda wanted to promote it." The left and right both viciously attacked it outside of alternative news sites. However, they faced a problem. Even though they claimed it was debunked (without showing how), they caused more people to go online and research it. It wasn't until the gunman conveniently shot up Comet Pizza that the MSM started covering the story more extensively, since now they could point out how "crazy and dangerous these conspiracy theorists are."
