People want to communicate, but I think when a forum becomes infested in public the company feels entitled to change it. Even if they recreate the features again.

<p>The fucked up thing is... Well, fuck capitalism. Let&#39;s start there. </p>

<p>Capitalist ideology results in everyone constantly trying to exploit one another because capitalism just <em>oversimplifies</em> it to the point that any greedy peasant can fuck people over.</p>

<p>As I was initially going to say, the fucked up thing is how <em>popularity</em> automatically leads into this. Popularity means capitalism can be hardcore easy-mode for anyone with a voice. Advertising exists because people know how to connect with things that are popular. It makes money. Propaganda works.</p>

<p>So right when Reddit gets more popular, discussion quality went downhill, but it simultaneously meant advertisers became more attracted. That means shills are both <em>more likely</em> as well as <em>harder to spot</em> considering popularity means Reddit is open to people who would&#39;ve otherwise been too stupid to find it.</p>

<p>I work myself into aneurysms trying to spot shills, but I also know it&#39;s going to be impossible to confirm a lot of the time, since there are just a fuckload of stupid people tied into the propaganda-fest like a fucking human centipede. And it&#39;s not even <em>just</em> &quot;stupid&quot; people, which is the worst part, probably. I&#39;m sure there are plenty of intelligent people who just have far too much trust in establishments or too much ignorance toward the necessity to highlight corruption.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are a bunch of explanations for the things talked about.  Main one is since Reddit became more popular, people sought to manipulate it outside of reddit so it&#39;s not that it was bought and sold but, subs like r/news had to devise and implement some new rules to combat people trying to manipulate it.<br/>
  Not saying that&#39;s what happened, but some of the stuff talked about is along those lines</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Think of every Federal Election as a money laundering opportunity for political parties - it truly IS a chance for parties to &quot;legitimize&quot; large amounts of money without question.  </p>

<p>I mean all the Clinton Foundation money that&#39;s being kept off-shore - Moroccan Royal family&#39;s $12mil &quot;donation&quot; and Bill&#39;s $1mil birthday gift check from Qatar.  </p>

<p>Now go out and compare the regulations for election advertising via the main mediums: Broadcast TV, Print, Radio ... and <strong>online</strong>.<br/>
There are 1000 holes in the online regulations that are about to be taken advantage of - standard costs are HUGELY variable, there is no comparisons set between Facebook, Twitter, Reddit and 1000 websites that have NO traffic (by comparison).  </p>

<p>That&#39;s what it&#39;s all about, reddit have sold out their interests on running a website, so they can dig into the trough again in 2020.  </p>

<p>Side note, it&#39;s not the Democrats fault the Republicans are too stupid to ALSO take advantage of these regulatory faults.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That happened to digg. Digg used to be a site where users would vote on stories they like. But it quickly became overrun with &#39;power&#39; users that had a large network of &#39;friends&#39; that would upvote their articles. In reality it became advertising disguised as news. It was also dominated by a small number of websites. I guess they figured gaming the site was a very cheap way of advertising. A front page digg article could drive massive amounts of traffic to a site, sometimes enough to take it down. Reddit has no doubt suffered a similar fate but probably in a worse way. I am pretty sure governments/corporations have an army of trolls controlling the narrative on various topics such as GMOs, politics, etc. You are allowed free speech, but only if you want to talk about funny cat videos.</p>

It is like a Twitter/Reddit hybrid with its own unique design and layout with an emphasis on free speech, so yeah you will see racist fucks on there getting upvoted but it is what it is. There are options to filter those people out of your feed if you feel the need to. I really love the website though.</p>

<p>You can buy pro for $60/yr to help keep the website running and I think it&#39;s worth it. You get more features, a nice little &quot;PRO&quot; tag next to your name, and the option to use GabTV when it&#39;s fully released (basically their own streaming service). Also, you can change your username anytime on both PRO and standard as well as having customizable profiles.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s like main stream media now. You can go there to see the narrative of the day. The good news is Reddit is mainstream now. I&#39;ve been on this site since 2006 (see my flair). It&#39;s good that there is a lot of traffic and some great niche subs. But yeah the admins work with the powers that be to chaperone the front page. That&#39;s sad but there will be other havens of quality. But yeah it may very well be on its way down like digg.com. loss of Freedom and attempting to control the organic always ends up in a sterile landscape</p>

<p>Reddit is a privately owned business that&#39;s run for a profit. That means they provide the services that their customers pay them for.</p>

<p>If someone with $$$ wants to promote a narrative or a certain point of view, reddit will either let them do so (shills, bots astroturfing etc.) or they will actively help out (biased mods, censorship, locked comments, shadowbans etc.)</p>

<p>We aren&#39;t the customer, we&#39;re the product.</p>
