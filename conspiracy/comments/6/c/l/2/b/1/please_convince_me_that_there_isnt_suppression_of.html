        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Yesterday and Friday, I posted these two challenges on <a href="/r/WikiLeaks">/r/WikiLeaks</a> for naysayers who want to dismiss the Seth Rich murder investigation. I&#39;m trying to think everything through as rationally as I can, and keep reaching a different conclusion from the overwhelming media consensus, and lots of posters here. Some people have responded with some reasonable but relatively minor points, but no one has yet given me a compelling rebuttal to either challenge. Can anyone here? Sincere disagreements and &quot;devil&#39;s advocates&quot; welcome.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Challenge #1: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WikiLeaks/comments/6c78z5/suppression_of_evidence_in_seth_rich_investigation/">Suppression of evidence in Seth Rich investigation</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;ve got a challenge for anyone who wants to argue the Seth Rich investigation is nothing.</p>

<p>It&#39;s true that there still isn&#39;t definitive, bulletproof evidence. And that&#39;s actually part of the problem. </p>

<ul>
<li>We don&#39;t know what&#39;s on Rich&#39;s computer. But WHY don&#39;t we know? Why was a computer confiscated in response to a botched robbery in the street? Why was the PI working for the family unable to access this computer, even 10 months after the murder when surely they&#39;d have done anything they were going to do with it by now? Why has absolutely zero information been released about that computer, except an unverifiable anonymous claim?</li>
<li>ALL the reporting says that Seth Rich was alive and talkative when the cops found him shot. And yet we haven&#39;t been told a single word about what he told them at that time. Why the hell is that? Unless he was delirious, which was not reported, wouldn&#39;t he most likely have told them in his own words <em>exactly</em> what happened?</li>
<li>There should be video footage from a number of surveillance cameras and police body cameras. Some surveillance footage has been vaguely described in the press. But not a single image, let alone video, associated with the murder has been released to the public. Why? Where is it?</li>
</ul>

<p>With a high-profile murder unsolved for 10 months, and no suspects or substantive leads identified, you would think that they would have released whatever information they could that might help them find Rich&#39;s killer. Any image of the killer or killers, however grainy -- any information from the victim himself, however vague -- could be seen or heard by the right member of the public to give them a lead. (Although the chances of people remembering enough to help solve the case become slimmer and slimmer as the months go on.) And the reason the computer is involved at all is pretty puzzling, outside the context of a deliberate cover-up -- never mind the computer apparently being buried under bureaucracy. </p>

<p>Yes, evidence is still lacking. (Although Rich being a big Bernie supporter and his old DNC mentor mocking him posthumously are some very interesting developments.) But partly, it seems that that&#39;s because evidence is being deliberately withheld, for some reason. Can anyone explain the complete lack of any information from these three sources --  the computer, video footage, and Rich&#39;s own words before he died --  in any context besides deliberate withholding as part of a cover-up? Because I am sincerely stumped.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Challenge #2: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WikiLeaks/comments/6cdd7m/dishonest_suppression_of_public_investigation_of/">Dishonest suppression of public investigation of Seth Rich&#39;s murder: Five examples</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Last night, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WikiLeaks/comments/6c78z5/suppression_of_evidence_in_seth_rich_investigation/">I posted a challenge</a> to those who would argue that the Seth Rich investigation is nothing -- to explain why key pieces of evidence we know exist, and could contribute greatly to solving the case, have not been publicly disclosed. That still stands. But there&#39;s something else that&#39;s <em>really</em> bugging me: common but deeply flawed talking points people keep reciting to derail discussion of the case. Many of them are very misleading upon further inspection.</p>

<p>So here&#39;s another challenge: address these critiques of the typical arguments given <em>against</em> pursuing this case.</p>

<p><strong>1. &quot;Look at the TIMING. Isn&#39;t it obvious this is just a distraction from Trump disclosing classified information to Russia?&quot;</strong></p>

<p>Fox News did not invent the controversy over this case. It&#39;s been on a slow boil for the better part of a year, with the suspicious timing and circumstances of Rich&#39;s death followed by gratuitous hints dropped by WikiLeaks and Assange. It&#39;s possible that Fox carefully chose when to cover new developments -- but they sure would be spoiled for choice. There hasn&#39;t been a day since Trump&#39;s inauguration when he hasn&#39;t been embroiled in some scandal or other. I&#39;m not sure I&#39;d even put this one in the top five. </p>

<p>Name a date since January 20th when a non-Trump political story couldn&#39;t be accused of being a distraction from the latest Trump-related controversy. And tell me why news outlets should wait around for slow news days to cover the investigation of Seth Rich&#39;s death. He&#39;s not &quot;today&#39;s top five puppy videos&quot;. </p>

<p><strong>2. &quot;Look who&#39;s covering and following this case. All right-wingers. Clearly this is more politically motivated right-wing fake news.&quot;</strong></p>

<p>It should be obvious before I say anything that this argument is a fallacy. The credibility of the case rests on its <em>evidence</em>, not who currently believes it. (Only hardcore &quot;Bernie Bros&quot; believed the DNC was sabotaging the Sanders campaign, based on suspicious circumstances most were happy to ignore -- until the undeniable proof came out.) Putting it in artificial partisan terms just serves to prejudice left-wingers reading about it for the first time against considering the facts fairly. </p>

<p>It&#39;s true that it&#39;s mostly being covered by right-wing outlets, and you have to consider their motives and sources. But let&#39;s think this through. Most mainstream media outlets downplaying this case <em>ferociously</em> endorsed Hillary Clinton, and were subsequently implicated in unethical collusion by the DNC and Podesta leaks. &quot;Russian interference&quot; functions as a convenient excuse to misdirect blame for their breaches of journalistic ethics; &quot;exposed by a disgusted insider who was then murdered&quot; would look a <em>whole</em> lot worse for them. Fox News has a history of blatant right-wing bias, yes, but CNN, WaPo, NYT, etc. have a known conflict of interest and history of compromised ethics regarding this <em>specific</em> issue. Why do they deserve greater deference? You&#39;ve got to focus on evidence and critical thinking, not on partisanship. (And just for the record, I&#39;m a far-left Canadian feminist who despises Trump, voted for Trudeau, and is disappointed he hasn&#39;t been progressive enough. So no, this isn&#39;t an exclusively right-wing issue.)</p>

<p><strong>3. &quot;These wacky conspiracy theorists will believe anything.&quot;</strong></p>

<p>I&#39;m sure there are some people who are 100% convinced that the DNC killed Seth Rich. I&#39;m not one of those people, though, and most people I&#39;ve seen commenting on this issue aren&#39;t either. We&#39;re pointing out causes for suspicion that are largely going ignored -- and the way they&#39;re being ignored and marginalized despite their validity is itself suspicious. </p>

<p>It&#39;s jumping to conclusions to assert that it <em>wasn&#39;t</em> the DNC, without evidence to the contrary, when there&#39;s cause to suspect that they would have both the motive (Rich having apparently been a Bernie supporter and at least potentially the source of the DNC leaks) and means (few organizations would have more pull in Washington than the DNC if they actually wanted to halt an investigation and urge the media narrative in a different direction). At <em>minimum</em>, they&#39;re a plausible lead, but many won&#39;t even consider it because of political bias. </p>

<p>Imagine if this wasn&#39;t tied to politics. Like, let&#39;s replace the DNC with Exxon, Seth Rich with an Exxon employee, perhaps secretly a vehement climate change activist, who was killed under suspicious circumstances right before a compromising leak exposing unethical conduct of the company, let&#39;s say falsifying documents to appear more &quot;green&quot;. Imagine that despite a lack of conclusive evidence to prove it, the dominant media narrative was that Exxon&#39;s rival Shell was responsible for the leak, allegedly meant to give Shell an unfair market advantage, which conveniently turned Exxon&#39;s embarrassment into weapon to use against their competitor. I bet it would be a lot less controversial that we&#39;d need to push to make absolutely sure that Exxon wasn&#39;t using its immense resources and power to get away with murder of a relatively powerless whistleblowing employee. </p>

<p>The most powerful deserve the <em>most</em> scrutiny because they&#39;re generally able to put a thumb on the scale and pull strings when they want to -- and it&#39;s well known that it&#39;s often the most unscrupulous who gain the most power, almost by definition. And yet there&#39;s this tendency to dismiss anyone who expresses suspicion that a powerful entity may have done something nefarious as a wacky conspiracy theorist jumping to crAaAzy conclusions. No, letting the powerful off the hook without proper scrutiny --, above-average scrutiny even, given their advantages -- is jumping to conclusions, and being absurdly trusting. It&#39;s pretty messed up how expressing suspicion about the very powerful has somehow been conflated in public dialogue with being convinced that UFOs used fluoride chemtrails to kill Elvis.</p>

<p><strong>4. &quot;The Fox News story this whole thing is based on was retracted. It was a hoax.&quot;</strong></p>

<p>This might be the single most pernicious bit of misinformation going around. First of all, people were suspicious about the circumstances of Seth Rich&#39;s death and the &quot;botched robbery&quot; explanation WAY before Fox News ever covered it. Bruised face and hands, shot twice in the back, nothing stolen, &quot;botched robbery&quot;. That never added up. DNC employee murdered 12 days before massive leak of DNC emails. Huh. Seth Rich was alive and talkative when police arrived, and yet there were no leads, or any information at all about the killer/s. Weird. Then Julian Assange named him in a response to a question about sources, and WikiLeaks offered the $20,000 reward for information leading to his murderer/s. That was already plenty to drive reasonable suspicion around his death. </p>

<p>But the most egregious thing about this claim that it was a retracted hoax is that most of Fox&#39;s coverage was not even retracted. The only part that was was Wheeler implying that he could independently corroborate the anonymous official&#39;s claim that there was correspondence between Seth Rich and WikiLeaks. Fox did not retract their reporting on the anonymous official&#39;s claim, or Wheeler&#39;s reporting on his own investigation, like his claims that a source in the police department said they were told to stand down, and that he was given the run-around and couldn&#39;t locate Rich&#39;s confiscated computer, where he thought the smoking-gun evidence would be. Every claim still stands unretracted, although concrete evidence is still lacking. The only thing that changed with the &quot;retraction&quot; is that the anonymous claim is not <em>independently corroborated</em> by the family&#39;s PI. That&#39;s it. If that&#39;s your idea of &quot;debunked hoax&quot;, but &quot;anonymous sources say Trump is literally KGB&quot; is hard-hitting journalism, I don&#39;t know what to tell you, except work on your ability to form an independent thought.</p>

<p><strong>5. &quot;But think of the poor grieving FAMILY. They don&#39;t deserve to have their son&#39;s memory disrespected like this!&quot;</strong></p>

<p>Tell that to Brad Bauman. The family&#39;s DNC-friendly spokesperson is actively discouraging people from pushing to investigate Seth Rich&#39;s death in a case that&#39;s gone unsolved for almost year, and where there&#39;s clearly suppression of evidence going on (see my last post linked above). He&#39;s using their grief to shame people into ignoring this unsolved murder. That&#39;s despicable. They wanted answers -- that&#39;s why they hired Rod Wheeler. I condemn jumping to premature conclusions for political purposes, but it is reasonable to suspect possible involvement of the DNC, which for the public good demands at least being convincingly ruled out. Even if it ultimately has nothing to do with the DNC, Rich&#39;s murder stands a much better chance of being solved if more people are paying attention to it. It&#39;s blatantly obvious that Bauman is not putting the interests of the Rich family first, and nor is anyone else who uses their grief to try to manipulate people into ignoring this case, and to especially disregard any possible involvement of the DNC, even though nothing has ruled that out.</p>

<hr/>

<p>But I&#39;m thinking most of the people pushing these arguments already know all that -- they just don&#39;t care. They seem perfectly happy to accuse political bias while acting on their own. That&#39;s my impression anyway. Please show me where I&#39;m wrong in my reasoning. All I care about here is the truth, and making sure the powerful are not getting away with murder. If I could be convinced this was all right-wing propaganda, it would be a pretty huge load off my mind.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are some great comments in the original threads, but I&#39;m still waiting for someone to explain where I&#39;m going wrong with my reasoning to look at this SO differently from nearly everybody in the media. Very interested in dialogue with those who&#39;ve thought all this through and reach different conclusions. I&#39;m very uncomfortable feeling like there&#39;s could be a big cover-up going on that I can&#39;t do anything about. Thanks!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Seth Rich murdered by DNC theory and he is the leaker is the only one that accounts for WL&#39;s tweeting about him constantly.  Many people die in DC every year.  Many of them are Dems.  Some even work for the DNC.  SR is the only one that WL has a bounty on info for and has tweeted about at least 10 times.  </p>

<p>The theory also accounts for why the DNC refused to allow the FBI to examine their servers.  If Russians hacked it, they&#39;d be lining up to give it to the FBI immediately.  The DNC has no reason to deny them access unless they are lying with the narrative.  </p>

<p>The theory explains the bizarre Russian narrative being pushed so hard.  They want the Russians did it idea to spread and be accepted.  The truth is way more sinister.  </p>

<p>It would explain the disturbing attempts to silence the posts of those pushing the SR murder/leaker theory.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>WikiLeaks does have a 100% track record, but they also never claimed Seth Rich was their source (obviously, since that would go against their whole model). I share your suspicions, believe me -- I just need more solid evidence before I&#39;ll be certain. </p>

<p>Another possibility is that the source submitted the leaks entirely anonymously, and that upon seeing the news about Rich&#39;s murder, the WikiLeaks staff became concerned that he might have been their source and paid the ultimate price for it, and that the hints reflect their suspicion rather than their insider knowledge. Just a thought. Very curious to see what Kim Dotcom actually knows...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If Assange was truly interested in protecting sources, as he is in every other situation ever, he would not hint-hint like this. &quot;Trying to maintain his policy&quot; doesn&#39;t cut it here. It&#39;s not that hard to do, you don&#39;t hint-hint in any direction. </p>

<p>When weighing the factors in play here, it twists me into a rhetorical knot. Cannot reveal sources but can hint. Cannot reveal sources but can, in only one instance ever, say who it was not and hint-hint who it was. That is suspicious, and I hold no one influential above suspicion. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t <em>want</em> it to be suspicious, but I think the complexity and vagueness/certainty aspect is intentional. I&#39;m calling his bluff on this. His entire credibility, aside from his personal opinions and loyalties, is based on providing hard evidence...but in this one case, evidence is not needed? It would &quot;break the rules&quot;? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure, but that&#39;s entirely speculation. Since when does speculation of any kind form the backbone of belief in a Wikileaks-related issue? It is just as speculative to view the current iteration of WL as a duel enterprise; release factual documents, float factual, partially factual and potentially fully made up claims on social media, in interviews, but never on the actual, hard-evidence producing WL site. </p>

<p>I have just as much evidence for this POV as Assange or anyone else has provided for a burgeoning theory and alleged grand crime. I think we should be questioning everyone powerful and influential. The moment Assange is viewed above all suspicion and becomes proof personified, he becomes a force no person should ever be assigned. History is littered with widely-worshipped bastions of &quot;truth&quot; and &quot;justice&quot; who end up being revealed to be the very opposite. I hope this is not what he has become. </p>

<p>I do think this source is unique though.  Most sources aren&#39;t the focus of such scrutiny.  Most sources dont end up leaking something that effects the American election.  Most sources dont end up shot dead.  Most sources dont end up being lied about and used as fuel but he DNC to further a witch hunt against Russians and Trump.  And its also likely the resistance we all have seen, closed subreddits, deleted SR reddit posts, the Donald shut down, 4 chan posts being censored, not to mention what happened at the Embassy to JA on Oct 17 are all related to SR and the fact that if this gets out and widely known Hillary and anyone else involved in this thing will be hanging from lampposts.  </p>

<p>This is a unique situation and JA and WL know it.  Their source was murdered.  Ive long wanted them to break protocol and just admit it.  I think its quite possible if KDC or other evidence surface in the next few days, they may actual admit it.  I think they need to admit it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He hasn&#39;t protected his source very well if you and many others are 100% sure it was Seth. I appreciate your arguments and reasoning but you&#39;re hitting these bullet points of this = this = therefore this, it&#39;s all so damn convenient and narratively concise, like the Trump/Russia theory. I worry we&#39;re being played on a grand scale. Millions of people have already fully made up their mind on this matter and will continue to believe it, even if proof never comes, and have arguments for why that&#39;s fine in this case. </p>

<p>I never thought we&#39;d be in the position of asking Wikileaks to produce evidence to back up a claim. In a general sense, that&#39;s a very curious thing. But even then one can claim it&#39;s a unique situation and all previous rules are allowed to be massaged, in just this once instance, and that rubs me the wrong way. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Im baffled really.  They haven&#39;t revealed a source.  WL and JA have never said he was a source.  You are lying if you say otherwise.  Its never come out of their mouths.  Im confused what you think is occurring?  WL has never printed or put out a false story or fake documents.  They&#39;ve never been wrong.  in 10 years.  Do you think they are lying to us?  That SR isn&#39;t a source?  or wasnt a source?  Why would they lie?  What purpose would it serve to get us to believe SR was a source when he wasnt?  Even if the argument is that WL was compromised on Oct 17, and that JA is dead, in prison or whatever, and that WL is not in control of their twitter, we still have the truth of the matter that WL was discussing Seth Rich prior to Oct 17th.  Why would that be?  </p>

<p>I dont understand your argument here.  What specifically is your evidence that we are being played?  Why would WL play us?  If the government was in control of WL, why would they want us digging into this case and SR specificially especially since its clear WL felt his case was important and significant prior to any suspected raid or takeover by the CIA</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, there hasn&#39;t been a reveal, but the hints...that is a reveal of sorts. That&#39;s why we&#39;re talking about this. I don&#39;t think he is suddenly under CIA control. Why do so many buy into that notion but strictly deny that he could be under GRU control? </p>

<p>I must correct you for &quot;WL has never printed or put out a false story or fake documents.&quot; They have never put out fake documents, true. What do you mean by false story? The Twitter stuff? That&#39;s different, completely different. As I understand the foundational tenet of WL, they don&#39;t put out any stories, they put out authentic documents. Therein lies a major dilemma, and what I find a big red flag.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know why Assange would lie. I also cannot for the life of me know why he would <em>sort of</em> reveal/indirectly finger a source. There&#39;s too many contradictions here for this to be as crisply believed as it is on this sub and elsewhere, specifically because it&#39;s based on claims alone so far.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You just got your answer.  JA tweeted what I just said, not an hour after I said it.  Its obvious, to anyone who has followed WL for more than a few minutes.  They never reveal their sources.  WL still has not admitted Manning was a source.  Even though we all know she was.  </p>

<p>WL will never admit their sources.  You are lying.  </p>

<p>Seriously though, if I leaked a bunch of stuff to WikiLeaks and then was killed for it, I&#39;d rather they do whatever they could within their guiding principles to make sure there was justice for my death and that my act of whistleblowing wasn&#39;t in vain, misrepresented to justify geopolitical conflict.

<p>If WL had already announced him as a leak, KDC wouldn&#39;t have to make this statement on Tuesday (assuming he is legit and really has information).</p>

<p>This is front page news specifically because he has said he will reveal SR as the leak.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, I didn&#39;t go into the Russia stuff much, but that&#39;s something that has been really bothering me, too. I especially have a hard time believing that with all the vast capabilities of the NSA and CIA <em>that we already know about</em>, never mind whatever we don&#39;t yet know about, for mass and targeted surveillance -- where they&#39;d especially target correspondence with Russian officials, like they did with Flynn -- that there wouldn&#39;t be positive proof of such communication implicating Trump officials in collusion by now. </p>

<p>The loosely Clinton-associated failed plot to frame Assange for accepting money from the Russian government also doesn&#39;t look good for the Russian hacking narrative...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is a very interesting theory that never occurred to me. Presumably his parents would know (anything else would be cruel IMO), and that would justify relying on a spokesperson with a better poker face, and discouraging politically charged investigation. And would also explain the bizarre police inaction. But wouldn&#39;t make sense with the private investigator. I&#39;d call that a very very long shot, but technically plausible.
