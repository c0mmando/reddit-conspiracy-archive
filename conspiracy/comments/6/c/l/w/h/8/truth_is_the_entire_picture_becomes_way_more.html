        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Government especially has evolved into a very &quot;Mafia-esque&quot; operation.</p>

<p>It is held down entirely by blackmail and by paying certain people off, just like organized crime, and they maintain power through fear and intimidation. </p>

<p>They pay off police, FBI, politicians, judges, you name it. Sound familiar? </p>

<p>They run several &quot;rackets&quot; like the mob and organized crime as well. However, these &quot;gangsters&quot; are playing their little Mafia game on a much bigger scale than 1930&#39;s Chicago. They run the show on the World Stage. </p>

<p>The War on Drugs is probably the most obvious and profitable racketeering op they run to this day. They make money on court costs, prisoners, and the private prisons are in on the &quot;racket&quot;. Largely nonviolent and innocent people are herded into private contracted jails, to make tons of money for the system, and the CIA ships these drugs in. All while the media and police and government continue tell us that they are &quot;dangerous drugs&quot;. </p>

<p>Everybody gets a piece ^</p>

<p>9/11, a HUGE global racket, the gift that keeps on giving. A small circle of &quot;insiders&quot; who were aware of this attack (The WTC leaseholder, NYC mayor, upper echelons of our government, as well as Israel and Saudi&#39;s, the CIA, Bush and Cheney&#39;s contracting company Haliburton which made billions in Iraq, companies like Lockheed Martin and Boeing cashed out with the demand for more war machines, arms dealers, ect). They planned and orchestrated this, so they could profiteer from a massive illegal war campaign that continues to this day.</p>

<p>Once again, everyone got a piece.</p>

<p>It&#39;s like the  &quot;Luftanza Heist&quot; from the movie Goodfellas.</p>

<p>Some guys got a share and a piece of the Pie, some people got &quot;wacked&quot; or murdered to keep the crime organization they had running smoothly. It was all about business, the goal was to keep things moving, just like this criminal cabal of elitists in the modern day New World Order.</p>

<p>And, these people probably celebrate and live these incredibly decadent and lavish lifestyles, too. Caviar, champagne, finest organic food and cleanest water, drugs galore, gorgeous prostitutes and sex parties, sometimes even involving children (hence Pizzagate). This is literally the exact thing as the Mafia, only these people are more patient, they are much more intelligent, and they have WAY more power than organized crime cabals ever did. They have a much more sinister goal as well; &quot;totalitarian world state&quot;. The creation of a New World Order.</p>

<p>I just wanted to point out some similarities between the two to maybe make it easier for some people to understand what it is were up against. This analogy is easy to follow. </p>

<p><strong>These people don&#39;t give a fuck about you or their constituents they serve. They play the part of &quot;politicians&quot;, they look at you in the eye and tell you what you want to hear, but behind the scenes they are laughing at you for taking them seriously and believing them, while they continue this racketeering operation.</strong></p>

<p>Knowing that these people are just living it up, burns my ass. They are NOT untouchable, they CAN be gotten to, we just need more awareness. It churns my gut knowing that they live these EASY peasy lives. No bills, no rent, everything is taken care of. It&#39;s a big fucking party to them, and they enjoy this lifestyle. Remember that, they enjoy being parasites to <em>our</em>labor, and riding on the work and sacrifices of the masses to accommodate their lavish lifestyles. </p>

<p>FUCK. THEM. </p>

<p>Stay on them fellas. Don&#39;t let them divide us.
✌️</p>

    <div class="md"><p>too many people are unaware and complacent. What you said about them laughing at us is absolutely on the money. It&#39;s not just politicians either. It&#39;s any profession that demands to be trusted: politicians, religious leaders, doctors....they laugh at the very people they are supposed to protect. Meanwhile the general public just keeps letting them get away with it. Very sad!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly, they think the very people they are there to serve are fools. It&#39;s the oddest thing. So many segments of our society is program to demean the populations they are sworn to protect. Personally I suspect TPTB designed it that way. I am startling to really see through a lot of the institutionalized evil that has permeated the very groups that are supposed to serve us. Even banking now that I think of it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The only solution for this problem is for the people to unite.</p>

<p>Sadly, it seems it&#39;s too late for that now, the division is progesses too far.</p>

<p>7 billion people who rather watch masonic music videos and get their brain toasted than educate themselves about why they are trapped in this corrupt system. Just look at the view count on Youtube.</p>

<p>Obedient and ignorant slaves are the best slaves.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve done the Meth and calculated how much land in m² every person out of these 7 billion would have if earth was flat, no rivers, no deserts, no roads between properties, no building into height (no second floor etc.) but still having the oceans.</p>

<p>It&#39;s 27 m² per person.</p>

<p>Most wild cats (ocelot, tiger etc.) require up to 2 <strong>km²</strong> of living space, just not to get into fights with other cats.</p>

<p>Most humans today have less prospect than wild animals.</p>

<p>Because of these land issues, the &quot;elites&quot; are pushing depopulation so hard. The Georgia Guidestones tell them to keep population under 500 million. </p>

<p>These &quot;elites&quot; are evil but not stupid, if 500 million is their correct evaluation of a sustainable number of population we are long overdue to natural regulation.</p>

<p>Only this time it won&#39;t be natural.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are people for whom this is likely true, but to believe every politician is like this is just playing into the hands of the people that don&#39;t want people to actually participate.</p>

<p>Joe Biden doesn&#39;t get rich off this shit. Bernie Sanders has money, but not &quot;laughing his way to the bank&quot; money. Dennis Kucinich never got rich and never will. Hundreds of Congressmen were elected as members of the middle class and will stay that way.</p>

<p>Fight for the little guy and fight against the big guys. But believing stuff like the OP just leads people to think that you need to elect people who aren&#39;t politicians. And that&#39;s not going to help fix anything.</p>

<p>After WW2 hollywood started ignoring organized crime and the criminal syndicate moved into government, and now they run the whole show.  But they still operate on 1930-style organized crime rules and if you go watch some of those 1930s movies you&#39;ll learn a lot about our present system...</p>

Doubtful, much easier ways to achieve this than preparing a foreign asset. Terrorism is definitely real but the severity of it, especially in the Western World where it is overhyped and statistically unlikely to happen to anyone, is treated as a political platform.</p>
