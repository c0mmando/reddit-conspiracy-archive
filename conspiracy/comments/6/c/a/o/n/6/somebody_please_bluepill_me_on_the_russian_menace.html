</blockquote>

<p>Is this the new line now? You&#39;re not the first person I&#39;ve seen trying to rewrite history in this way. I wonder if this kind of revisionism will work?</p>

<p>The fact is, as <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-russia-putin-usa-trump-idUSKBN0U01NW20151217">early as 2015</a> there were stories about trump and Putin&#39;s relationship. By <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2016-03-30/trump-russia-adviser-carter-page-interview">March</a> and <a href="http://www.politico.eu/article/donald-trumps-russia-connections-foreign-policy-presidential-campaign/">April</a> of 2016 there were numerous stories discussing ties between people in his campaign and the Russians. And in the pre-election debates, Clinton flat-out called him Putin&#39;s puppet, in one of the most repeated and broadcast and discussed exchanges of all the debates. (&quot;You&#39;re the puppet!&quot;)</p>

<p>So claiming that discussing a Trump-Russia connection was cooked up after the election is pure, unadulterated bullshit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To believe the Russian narrative, you first have to believe the email fiasco was a hack, not a leak. I&#39;m assuming a lot of people with large businesses, or politicians, have ties to Russia. It was never a big deal until the Russian narrative started getting pushed. What happened was Russia was declared the enemy, and then &quot;ties to Russia&quot; were found retroactively. That&#39;s why Clinton, Podesta, and a bunch of other people had &quot;ties to Russia&quot; dug up. It was no big deal until all of a sudden it was. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If thats where your logic ends, cool - but explain to me why they are acting like its all a big mystery and why nobody in the previous administration did anything about it, if it is such a reality and such a big problem?</p>

<p>You realize that both the NSA and CIA have the capabilities to intercept any and all communications?  If the Trump admin had ties to Russia, this is not something that would happen overnight.  This would be decades in the making - the NSA and CIA would have known all about it, prior to him even running.</p>

<p>Now, I don&#39;t particularly care for Trump - but at some point you have to realize that you are being duped by this Russia agenda. Either:</p>

<p>A - they have known about the Russia/trump admin connection for a long time now, and they are all in on it and dont care, and are just jerking the public around for divisive purposes</p>

<p>Or</p>

<p>B - there is no legitimate Russia connection, and they are just jerking with the public.</p>

<p>Either way, you MUST realize that they are jerking you around.  You must realize this</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just look at the sources, Washington Post, the current employer of John Podesta, NYT whose coverage of Trump has been almost entirely negative.

    <div class="md"><p>I know that the russia narrative is bullshit; but i look at it this way- i believe it is a psyop and trump is totally in on the psyop to keep the argument and public discord up.  </p>

<p>The reason I think that is for many reasons.  One of which, you just explained by applying some very simple observational skills and logic - why doesn&#39;t trump and his staff do the same?  Its so easy and obvious to point out who the players are, and why the pieces fall where the fall.  This is not an accident.</p>

<p>Another reason is because we have a CIA and NSA with the highest surveillance powers possible - they would have all of the answers.  Neither Trump or his opposition is saying &quot;wtf, we could solve this in two seconds, just do it already.&quot;</p>

<p>The psyop is obvious when you realize that they want YOU to sort through the puzzle; but when you figure it out, you never ask why they aren&#39;t doing it themselves</p>

Russia is completely controlled by the Soviet Unions old deep state. They want to dismantle NATO and the best way to do that is to weaken the USA. Motives are all there, swaying foreign elections isn&#39;t a new thing to Russia (nor to the US, but that&#39;s whataboutism). Trump and some of his cabinet members have clear ties to Russia, most notably to the oil barons. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This.</p>

<p>And honestly everybody, I think r/conspiracy should be able to do a little better at devil&#39;s advocate - it&#39;s essential in any gaming scenario.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s why the Russians are an existential threat: They are leading the BRIC and like-minded nations away from the US Dollar as the standard currency for energy exchange. Nobody knows for sure what that will do to the US economy, but it&#39;s at least possible it would lead to catastrophic economic, and hence political, collapse. This is a strong argument, and it has precedents, since the US did exactly that, effectively destroying the old USSR using economic warfare. Schadenfreude much?</p>

<p>If we accept this is the real reason for the massive antipathy of the ruling elite to the current policies of Russia, it might also explain other issues that seem obscure. For instance, maybe the whole rival Mideast oil pipelines jousting is happening because they are known to be a &quot;inflection point&quot; in the current economic power struggle: if we win and get our pipeline in Syria, we keep the Dollar in place, but if they win, they will be able to flip a bare non-Western majority of countries to a different currency of their own liking. That would explain why all parties seem to be playing the utterly nonsensical Syria game to the bitter end. Maybe a lot really does depend on it.</p>

<p>This explanation is difficult to explain and understand to the masses, but if it is true, I don&#39;t understand why TPTB aren&#39;t screaming at us that the entire wealth of our nation, our relative position in the global order, and ultimately, the future of our grandchildren, is hanging in the balance right now. It would go a lot farther than the current farce, because it&#39;s believable.</p>

<p>That&#39;s what a bluepill looks like...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Seth Rich = Russian hacking. John Podesta came up with the Russia idea in the final days of the campaign as an excuse for why they lost because they had not planned on losing a rigged election. JP is now a contributor at Wapo as well as the fact that Amazon CEO and staunch Trump hater Jeff Bezos is the owner of the publication it&#39;s not a surprise you hear breathless accusations based on imaginary hearsay sources all day every day. In addition to that NYT is owned by Trump Hating billionaire Mexican Carlos Slim paired with all the main news outlets, many of whom had correspondences with the Clinton campaign throughout the election on how to swing it in her favor, you get a very desperate establishment who had no plan for Trump and are throwing all they have at him (and don&#39;t have) hoping it will stick. Special prosecutor and absence of Comey may end up proving that a lot of the loudest in the left and never-Trumper right  are actually the ones guilty of crimes. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah sure, but that&#39;s still a motive. Saying that it&#39;s just retaliation is whataboutism. We shouldn&#39;t have done it, but that doesn&#39;t make the retaliation right either. </p>
