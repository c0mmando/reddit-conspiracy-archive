       Explain why post-communist Russia and its president poses a clear and present danger to the American people.

       <li>
        It (the menace) doesn't exist, but ...

       <li>
        Maybe they want to influence US elections

       <li>
        And maybe they have back-channels to the US president
       </li>
       <li>
        Because Israel
       </li>

       (I lived thru the last part of the Cold War - we were fighting in 3rd World Countries against Soviet soldiers and equipment, and watching them eye to eye thru barbwire in Europe - I want that level menace assessment! Kinetic-level, Way-of-Life level)

       There is none. Clinton's people came up with it in the hours after she lost the election. It's mostly meant to explain her loss but also the Deep State and Dem moneybags like Soros need a new bogeyman and detest Russia (who is blocking a pipeline in Syria wanted by the US-Saudi-Israel axis of evil

       Is this the new line now? You're not the first person I've seen trying to rewrite history in this way. I wonder if this kind of revisionism will work?
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact is, as
       <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-russia-putin-usa-trump-idUSKBN0U01NW20151217">
        early as 2015
       </a>
       there were stories about trump and Putin's relationship. By
       <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2016-03-30/trump-russia-adviser-carter-page-interview">
        March
       </a>
       and
       <a href="http://www.politico.eu/article/donald-trumps-russia-connections-foreign-policy-presidential-campaign/">
        April
       </a>
       of 2016 there were numerous stories discussing ties between people in his campaign and the Russians. And in the pre-election debates, Clinton flat-out called him Putin's puppet, in one of the most repeated and broadcast and discussed exchanges of all the debates. ("You're the puppet!")
      </p>
      <p>
       So claiming that discussing a Trump-Russia connection was cooked up after the election is pure, unadulterated bullshit.

       To believe the Russian narrative, you first have to believe the email fiasco was a hack, not a leak. I'm assuming a lot of people with large businesses, or politicians, have ties to Russia. It was never a big deal until the Russian narrative started getting pushed. What happened was Russia was declared the enemy, and then "ties to Russia" were found retroactively. That's why Clinton, Podesta, and a bunch of other people had "ties to Russia" dug up. It was no big deal until all of a sudden it was.

       Its nothing about actual threats its just a line by donald supporters to try and dismiss it, its about corruption in the trump administration and that its ties are so heavy to russia that he may or may not have colluded with them at some point thus the investigation. The ties cant even be disputed at this point they are easily available facts.

       If thats where your logic ends, cool - but explain to me why they are acting like its all a big mystery and why nobody in the previous administration did anything about it, if it is such a reality and such a big problem?
      </p>
      <p>
       You realize that both the NSA and CIA have the capabilities to intercept any and all communications?  If the Trump admin had ties to Russia, this is not something that would happen overnight.  This would be decades in the making - the NSA and CIA would have known all about it, prior to him even running.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, I don't particularly care for Trump - but at some point you have to realize that you are being duped by this Russia agenda. Either:
      </p>
      <p>
       A - they have known about the Russia/trump admin connection for a long time now, and they are all in on it and dont care, and are just jerking the public around for divisive purposes
      </p>
      <p>
       Or
      </p>
      <p>
       B - there is no legitimate Russia connection, and they are just jerking with the public.
      </p>
      <p>
       Either way, you MUST realize that they are jerking you around.  You must realize this

       Just look at the sources, Washington Post, the current employer of John Podesta, NYT whose coverage of Trump has been almost entirely negative. Then comes in the "unnamed" sources that could literally be anyone (whose personal agenda can't be up for ridicule since they are not named) and lastly you have the media sensationalization of every breathe that man takes; articles are written in a way to trick the reader, everything he does "can possibly" "is unheard of", the "journalists" of the MSM are clearly pushing an agenda by making your mind up for you with their Op-ed style of writing that's so widely accepted now.

       I know that the russia narrative is bullshit; but i look at it this way- i believe it is a psyop and trump is totally in on the psyop to keep the argument and public discord up.
      </p>
      <p>
       The reason I think that is for many reasons.  One of which, you just explained by applying some very simple observational skills and logic - why doesn't trump and his staff do the same?  Its so easy and obvious to point out who the players are, and why the pieces fall where the fall.  This is not an accident.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another reason is because we have a CIA and NSA with the highest surveillance powers possible - they would have all of the answers.  Neither Trump or his opposition is saying "wtf, we could solve this in two seconds, just do it already."
      </p>
      <p>
       The psyop is obvious when you realize that they want YOU to sort through the puzzle; but when you figure it out, you never ask why they aren't doing it themselves

       I think the good guys prefer to operate in the shadows anyway - good guys would invoke positive change and let the bad guys take credit for it because all they care about is positive outcome; they don't need to gloat.  The people we see on the stage are precisely bad actors (in my opinion of course).

       the sources isnt washington post its facts you can look up their business ties if you actually look at the sources but since apparently they employ the democratic ras al ghul you can just dismiss them out of hand so convenient i bet you say every CNN article with a anon source BS despite every second one getting confirmed and the whitehouse constant complaining of illegal leaks from inside the WH.

       Long story short, this would imply that the Russia narrative is a psyop that Trump is equally participating in with the establishment to dupe the public into arguing about it - this is just like the obama birth certificate to cover up obamas cia past

       First, Putin is ex-KGB, so not quite post-communist Russia. Second, Russia is controlled by an oligarchy now, so almost post-communist. Russia is completely controlled by the Soviet Unions old deep state. They want to dismantle NATO and the best way to do that is to weaken the USA. Motives are all there, swaying foreign elections isn't a new thing to Russia (nor to the US, but that's whataboutism). Trump and some of his cabinet members have clear ties to Russia, most notably to the oil barons.
      </p>
      <p>
       TL;DR the Russian oligarchy wants to establish an [open] American oligarchy.

       Actually, in this case it isn't. The US specifically interfered in Russian elections, so any Russian interference in US elections could be seen as retaliation.

       Whataboutism would be "hey, they did it too", whereas this is more like "they did it to us, so we're doing it back".

       Essentially, he's saying he has already been "redpilled" and thus believes the Russia narrative is false, and he's asking someone to convince him it's not.

       This.
      </p>
      <p>
       And honestly everybody, I think r/conspiracy should be able to do a little better at devil's advocate - it's essential in any gaming scenario.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's why the Russians are an existential threat: They are leading the BRIC and like-minded nations away from the US Dollar as the standard currency for energy exchange. Nobody knows for sure what that will do to the US economy, but it's at least possible it would lead to catastrophic economic, and hence political, collapse. This is a strong argument, and it has precedents, since the US did exactly that, effectively destroying the old USSR using economic warfare. Schadenfreude much?
      </p>
      <p>
       If we accept this is the real reason for the massive antipathy of the ruling elite to the current policies of Russia, it might also explain other issues that seem obscure. For instance, maybe the whole rival Mideast oil pipelines jousting is happening because they are known to be a "inflection point" in the current economic power struggle: if we win and get our pipeline in Syria, we keep the Dollar in place, but if they win, they will be able to flip a bare non-Western majority of countries to a different currency of their own liking. That would explain why all parties seem to be playing the utterly nonsensical Syria game to the bitter end. Maybe a lot really does depend on it.
      </p>
      <p>
       This explanation is difficult to explain and understand to the masses, but if it is true, I don't understand why TPTB aren't screaming at us that the entire wealth of our nation, our relative position in the global order, and ultimately, the future of our grandchildren, is hanging in the balance right now. It would go a lot farther than the current farce, because it's believable.

       I've yet to hear it articulated 1. Why Russia would want Trump over Clinton  2. What exactly they supposedly did to interfere with the election
      </p>
      <p>
       Hillary used a non government server while sec os state.  Podesta had a lame p@ssword and staffers were probably phished.  If they were so smart and new Russia was out to get them you'd think they would have been more careful.

       Seth Rich = Russian hacking. John Podesta came up with the Russia idea in the final days of the campaign as an excuse for why they lost because they had not planned on losing a rigged election. JP is now a contributor at Wapo as well as the fact that Amazon CEO and staunch Trump hater Jeff Bezos is the owner of the publication it's not a surprise you hear breathless accusations based on imaginary hearsay sources all day every day. In addition to that NYT is owned by Trump Hating billionaire Mexican Carlos Slim paired with all the main news outlets, many of whom had correspondences with the Clinton campaign throughout the election on how to swing it in her favor, you get a very desperate establishment who had no plan for Trump and are throwing all they have at him (and don't have) hoping it will stick. Special prosecutor and absence of Comey may end up proving that a lot of the loudest in the left and never-Trumper right  are actually the ones guilty of crimes.
