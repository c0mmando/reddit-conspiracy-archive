        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">985</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2017-05-20 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/TheOtherU.html">TheOtherU</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;ve been on this website a lot longer than most of the people who use it now. I remember what it used to be. I remember Reddit when it felt &quot;underground&quot;, organic, truthful, and unbiased. I remember a time when the CEO of Reddit was a Free Speech advocate. I remember the community, and I remember the conversations that used to take place in the comments.</p>

<p>Getting on this website has become nothing short of surreal. This place had so much potential. What the hell happened?</p>

<p>Somewhere along the line, Reddits core values changed. They no longer valued free speech. They started imposing their own personal beliefs onto the structure of the website. </p>

<p>Remember how Reddit&#39;s supposed reasoning behind banning <a href="/r/fatpeoplehate">/r/fatpeoplehate</a> <a href="/r/coontown">/r/coontown</a> and all those other particularly distasteful subreddits was &quot;they were harassing, doxxing, vote brigading non stop&quot;. Notice any similarities with that supposed reasoning, and the reasons they imposed so many limitations and restrictions on <a href="/r/The_Donald">/r/The_Donald</a>? Clearly it has nothing to do with brigading or doxxing. They gave the same &quot;reasons&quot; for banning pizzagate talk. </p>

<p>Those are the go-to bullshit reasons that Reddit gives when they want to CONTROL a narrative, and SHUT DOWN a conversation. It&#39;s a pathetic attempt to remain &quot;neutral&quot; when it comes to politics, but it has become disgustingly obvious that Reddit&#39;s supposed neutrality is a front. </p>

<p>I use this website because I fell in love with the CORE concept of Reddit: We upvote things, and WE collectively get to decide what content is good or bad. It&#39;s beautiful in it&#39;s simplicity. But that time is over. </p>

<p>Reddit the company now control what content first of all even makes the cut, through use of &quot;power mods&quot; who are behind the scenes on Reddits payroll. They control most subreddits. Then they control what makes it to the front page. Then they control the comments with bots, artificial upvotes, and ACTUAL brigading of the people they disagree with. Then they control what goes on even within specific subreddits. </p>

<p>The thing that made Reddit unique, and GREAT in the first place is over. We no longer get to choose what we see on Reddit. EVERYTHING is controlled behind the scenes. You are the product, and the target. Your thoughts and perception of &quot;popular opinion&quot; is the casualty. Welcome to nu-Reddit.</p>

<p>Edit: To add a little more to this, anyone else remember when Ron Paul was running back in 2012 and everyone on Reddit started talking about how Ron Paul was racist, his supporters were racist, and conspiracy theorists in general were racist? Think about how that translates into the modern day... It&#39;s almost like the narrative they were pushing failed back then, and they recycled it for this election season and it stuck. Sorry a little unrelated, but my Reddit conspiracy wheels are turning.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh I&#39;m definitely &quot;over it&quot; as you so condescendingly stated. I hardly come on this website anymore. I much prefer 4chan over Reddit nowadays. It&#39;s funny because 4chan was the first message board I started using, then I switched to Reddit. But Reddit has become so disgusting in their business practice, I&#39;ve actually started to prefer 4chan in all its unfiltered glory to the cesspool.</p>

But it&#39;s like Twitter in the postings, but in each category you can upvote and downvote posts. It does have &quot;Subs&quot; sort of, like Funny and Politics, and also has trending topics like Twitter does. I think it&#39;s worth registering and testing it out. It is VERY Right and Conspiracy friendly. It feels like a very comfortable spot where free speech reigns. Right now. I think it has a lot of potential. </p>

<p>It&#39;s been a while, but I was banned from that sub because I had made a comment about one of Trump&#39;s campaign promises (can&#39;t recall which one), but said &quot;that sound unconstitutional.&quot; Hardly a controversial statement. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So I agree and disagree. With subs that are shutdown for brigading, it always baffles me that SRS is still in existence. They are probably the worst sub for brigading. </p>

<p>T_D was given the same rules as ETS, MarchAgainstTrump, and Resist (probably some others I can&#39;t remember). One of the main rules was just to stop linking to other subs because of the brigading. You can disagree, but I think it&#39;s reasonable. The non-trump subs have been following the same rules without much issue. Some of them have bots that automatically remove comments that link to other subs. T_D decided to continue with the linking to other subs and complained about censorship. </p>

<p>T_D, in the last few days especially, were starting witchhunts and harassing people in real life. IIRC one instance in the last few days involved medical professionals. That is simply a site-wide rule that they broke. </p>

<p>Reddit is obviously not the same as it was at conception. Money will almost always change things. Unfortunately, this is what we&#39;re given. At this point in reddit&#39;s stage, I don&#39;t think they&#39;re able to offer something that doesn&#39;t include some forms of censorship. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why shouldn&#39;t we be allowed to express our opinions outside of reddit? Why is it so dangerous for us to collaboratively express our opinions and do research? 4chan does this all the time, and it&#39;s part of what makes 4chan so great. One of the most exciting aspects of a massive online community like this is that we potentially have an effect on the real world. Why should our voices be stifled? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You have a very broad definition of harassment. Since when is the public not allowed to voice its opinion, however harsh it may be, to figures in the public spotlight? Sometimes people are mean. Reddit isn&#39;t responsible for these peoples opinions, and it happens whether they choose to try to stifle it or not. Reddit should stop acting as if everything its user base does has a direct financial or legal bearing on the way people see reddit as a company. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>For communities that are known for doxxing, I almost guarantee that it&#39;s not just emails that are going out. For some users it&#39;s likely taking things a step forward and getting addresses of places of work, home addresses, etc. That&#39;s the largest issue, and it&#39;s​ shown in the doctor post in particular. Sending Jeff Bezos an email is significantly different than posting the names, work places, god knows what else, of medical professionals who may or may not have had anything to do with Seth Rich. </p>

<p>Do we need to go over what happened with Pizzagate? What if someone showed up with a gun to that hospital and tried to attack the people who were on that list? After what happened with Pizzagate, that&#39;s why it&#39;s not ok. </p>

Then you have to re-establish your ethos for anyone to believe the argument you are making. For your audience to believe that you were here when Reddit was underground, new, and before  various parties had a stake in public opinion around here you need to prove that you had a vested interest in what was happening on Reddit.

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been posting this a few places because I think it points to the larger problem of the establishment&#39;s infiltration of social media, and it&#39;s not a perspective I&#39;d heard before:</p>

<p>Relevant:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Goons [SJW/Alphabet] are incredibly successful at infiltrating namefag [anon] communities. First, they get into the chatrooms of the admin or whomever is in charge of them by befriending somebody related to them, then invite some of their own friends in and create what appears to the an admin as a group of orbiters your average egotistical namefag admin will love.  </p>

<p>If modship is not granted this peaceful method, they use the CIA style of infiltration. The first prize they always seek is blackmail, such as the head of the group&#39;s doxx or something embarrassing that would ruin your online social capital, and then leverage it into either turning you into an outright asset or outright handing over your community over to them. They will go to any lengths to obtain that, including on a multitude of occasions sending over underage goon females to sleep with none the wiser Redditors and then threatening to go to the police unless the adminship was handed to their sock account. </p>

<p>Failing obtaining influence that way, they force a migration to a goon-operated safe space by manufacturing controversy and either demanding the mod team step down or the userbase of the space migrate to a space with goon mods... </p>

<p>Barring all that, they appeal to the site admins about some sort of abuse the mods are doing and demand that they be removed and replaced with orbiter goons in the admin&#39;s social group.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Pence is worse in that his beliefs are the kind that are actually scary and I feel like he&#39;ll try to actually pass some of his crazy, discriminatory beliefs. Some fun things about him: he believes in conversion therapy and wanted to fund them with taxpayer money; he&#39;s all for defunding planned parenthood; he&#39;s ok with businesses discriminating against homosexuals if they cite religious reasons; he was against federal funding to help people with hiv and AIDS unless the government also invested in some programs to discourage homosexuality; he was against don&#39;t ask, don&#39;t tell; he supports the wall; he was against Syrian refugees in Indiana when he was congressman; he&#39;s diverted funds for public schools to vouchers for private schools; he&#39;s skeptical of climate change and likes his coal; he likes the TPP; etc!  Extra fun but of info: in 1990 he used political donations to pay his mortgage, credit cards, car payments, groceries, golf tournament fees.  Trumps fucking stupid and is dangerous, mike pence is the typical old-school sexist racist bigot that will do everything he can to impose his extreme beliefs on everyone.</p>

Not any more than any other community on Reddit. It&#39;s just that they&#39;ve cherry picked the communities in which they want to enforce those rules to the fullest, and subjected them to the most extreme forms of scrutiny, as a means to effectively silence their opinions. I&#39;m sure you could find evidence of every single thing being thrown at these subreddits in other subs. It&#39;s just that they choose to turn a blind eye to those other subs having done it as well. They&#39;re selectively enforcing the rules. Bolding your text doesn&#39;t automatically make your argument valid. It just proves that you&#39;re emotionally connected to the issue, and likely having your logic skewed by your emotion.</p>

<p>Leftists <strong>REQUIRE</strong> deception. No one would every knowingly vote to eventually be a slave. So deception (and force) are the ways leftists gain (and maintain) power. Deception = propaganda (disguised as unbiased information). Think fake news.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, this is not limited to print and TV and radio. This propaganda is prevalent in NEW MEDIA as well! This means all corners of the digital world, Google, facebook, twitter, and yes, Reddit.  They are leftist shills, pushing propaganda which they desperately hope is not exposed as such.</p>

<p>It isnt <strong>JUST</strong> Reddit, but it includes Reddit. Very sad.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s fucking disturbing. I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s just getting a lot worse, or if part of the perception of far more propaganda is my own awareness of it all. I have only recently become educated on most of the issues discussed around here. Probably a bit of both.</p>

<p>Reddit the company now control what content first of all even makes the cut, through use of &quot;power mods&quot; who are behind the scenes on Reddits payroll. They control most subreddits. Then they control what makes it to the front page. Then they control the comments with bots, artificial upvotes, and ACTUAL brigading of the people they disagree with. Then they control what goes on even within specific subreddits.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Don&#39;t forget that some corporations have paid off the mods of various subreddits to allow their websites to be promoted in their subs, and receive big traffic from Reddit which is worth big money.</p>

<p>Funny thing is Reddit used to be where I came to find the truth. </p>

<p>Now it&#39;s where I monitor the mainstream media and narratives.</p>

<p>They&#39;ve completely turned this site into engagement driven propaganda and dopamine inducing click bait for something as common as money and politics. </p>

<p>It&#39;s sad really. </p>

<p>I never thought I&#39;d live long enough to see the death of free speech, but now I realize we never really had it in the first place. </p>

<p>Keep conspiring my friend. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Its right under your nose. They banned all the aggressive subs where people got to blow off steam and then they installed t_d and gave that user base a place to run wild again (of course always under the illusion that they are being supressed just as they were with those original more focused subs) Reddit plays both sides of the coin. They could have stamped out t_d if they wanted to. Its all theatrics. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>For communities that are known for doxxing, I almost guarantee that it&#39;s not just emails that are going out. For some users it&#39;s likely taking things a step forward and getting addresses of places of work, home addresses, etc. That&#39;s the largest issue, and it&#39;s​ shown in the doctor post in particular. Sending Jeff Bezos an email is significantly different than posting the names, work places, god knows what else, of medical professionals who may or may not have had anything to do with Seth Rich. </p>

<p>Do we need to go over what happened with Pizzagate? What if someone showed up with a gun to that hospital and tried to attack the people who were on that list? After what happened with Pizzagate, that&#39;s why it&#39;s not ok. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If AI enhanced aren&#39;t already in use they will be soon. Train an AI chat tool up on a target community, feed it some guidelines for responses, have it spit out possible replies for an operator to respond to comments with to push a certain viewpoint. Single individual can now submit comments faster than normal users. Put a small group in a room together with access to similar tools and entire conversations can be slid easily.</p>

<p>At some point AI will progress far enough to have the handlers pulled off and largely automate the process. </p>
