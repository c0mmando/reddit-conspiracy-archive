    <div class="md"><p>Yes of course. I&#39;ve been here for a while, I&#39;ve just only recently got brave enough to start posting. </p>

<p>And yes I&#39;ve seen all the pro-Trump posts and general shift to the right, but the events of last night has pushed a huge amount of these supporters to us. It&#39;s do or die time now. Either we make sure this influx of supporters are willing to play fair (i.e. Think critically of Trump) or we&#39;re gonna become a farce of ourselves. </p>

<p>I hope it&#39;s the former because we have a great opportunity here. These people have a critical view already of TPTB, but they think that their man is against them. We just need them to take that one more step. They can be great allies, or just another psy-op. </p>

<p>The_Donald is a rally subreddit where the president is referred to as god emperor. A slimy businessman is somehow seen as the bastion of honesty and anti-corruption.</p>

<p>The absolute best part about this, is that T_D seems to constantly talk about pedophiles and think every politician they disagree with runs a satanic pedophile ring and their nickname reads like it&#39;s short for pedophile. It&#39;s just so ridiculous it feels like they got tricked into using it and just never realised.</p>

<p>Stop calling them refugees. It&#39;s another way they can push their false marginalization narrative.

    <div class="md"><p>They keep using it. They are acting like they are now nomads in a country they allowed to slip away by projecting, instead of protecting. They&#39;ve been voting republican so long, they don&#39;t realize they&#39;ve been voting against their own interests. Neither do the democrats and this is where the problem lay. </p>

<p>We as proles need to unite and take it back. There are literally billions of us. It doesn&#39;t matter if we are gay, black, poor, etc. The only teams are us versus them. </p>

<p>I used to be big on listening to liberal podcasts, but over the weeks I have realized that they are neolibs and coulnd&#39;t care less about anything other than pushing their narrative to more and more listeners to make more and more money. This helps them sleep. Meanwhile, I am up, not sleeping but reading. Vonnegut, Marx, Salinger, books about hegemony, conservatism, liberalism. </p>

<p>People stand outside abortion clinics shaming people instead of talking with them or pushing for legislation to make birth control available which has shown that it helps reduce pregnancy. Reduced pregnancy reduces abortion. People would rather bash their heads into a wall and argue. </p>

<p>Have you read Robert Anton Wilson? Some of his stuff is crazy nutty (almost certainly satire) but a lot of it is really insightful. I would also recommend Sartre, Camus, Derrida, and of course Nietzsche. </p>
