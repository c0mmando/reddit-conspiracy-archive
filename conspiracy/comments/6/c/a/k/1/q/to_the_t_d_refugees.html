       You are welcome here BUT we do not support blind following. We are anti-power here. Trump is the power and he's not on our side. Before you start blasting this site with pro-Trump news and theories, please realize that this is only welcome if you think critically.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you think critically, you'll realize that Trump is just another puppet for TPTB.

       Yes of course. I've been here for a while, I've just only recently got brave enough to start posting.
      </p>
      <p>
       And yes I've seen all the pro-Trump posts and general shift to the right, but the events of last night has pushed a huge amount of these supporters to us. It's do or die time now. Either we make sure this influx of supporters are willing to play fair (i.e. Think critically of Trump) or we're gonna become a farce of ourselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       I hope it's the former because we have a great opportunity here. These people have a critical view already of TPTB, but they think that their man is against them. We just need them to take that one more step. They can be great allies, or just another psy-op.

       If you think more users from the_donald will lead to critical thinking, I've got really bad news. Just look at the sub right now. Everything is either Seth Rich or about The_Donald itself.
      </p>
      <p>
       The_Donald is a rally subreddit where the president is referred to as god emperor. A slimy businessman is somehow seen as the bastion of honesty and anti-corruption.
      </p>
      <p>
       I expect to see a lot more garbage on the sub, more keks, cartoon frogs, people calling each either pedes or shills.

       The absolute best part about this, is that T_D seems to constantly talk about pedophiles and think every politician they disagree with runs a satanic pedophile ring and their nickname reads like it's short for pedophile. It's just so ridiculous it feels like they got tricked into using it and just never realised.

       I should have said "overlook" racism and bigotry, my bad. Because you certainly did that in order to vote for him. Don't worry, the mods here will make this your new Donald safe space soon enough. The mods who lean liberal are too afraid of their overlords.

       Stop calling them refugees. It's another way they can push their false marginalization narrative. Refugees are people who have been harmed by their government, actually marginalized due to religion or beliefs. They have no home, sleep in tents and wander. We won't let them in our country anymore, so why should we accept a bunch of pizza eating pedes.

       You're right. Refugee is a bad word for this. It's the word I've been seen being used so I copied it. Probably a bad move.

       They keep using it. They are acting like they are now nomads in a country they allowed to slip away by projecting, instead of protecting. They've been voting republican so long, they don't realize they've been voting against their own interests. Neither do the democrats and this is where the problem lay.

       We as proles need to unite and take it back. There are literally billions of us. It doesn't matter if we are gay, black, poor, etc. The only teams are us versus them.

       I used to be big on listening to liberal podcasts, but over the weeks I have realized that they are neolibs and coulnd't care less about anything other than pushing their narrative to more and more listeners to make more and more money. This helps them sleep. Meanwhile, I am up, not sleeping but reading. Vonnegut, Marx, Salinger, books about hegemony, conservatism, liberalism.

       People stand outside abortion clinics shaming people instead of talking with them or pushing for legislation to make birth control available which has shown that it helps reduce pregnancy. Reduced pregnancy reduces abortion. People would rather bash their heads into a wall and argue.

       Brilliant work.

       Have you read Robert Anton Wilson? Some of his stuff is crazy nutty (almost certainly satire) but a lot of it is really insightful. I would also recommend Sartre, Camus, Derrida, and of course Nietzsche.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nietzsche's genealogy of morals (if you can ignore the blatant anti-semitism) spells out exactly how TPTB control us. Brilliant man.

       I LOVE Camus and Derrida. I haven't read Sarte, nor Wilson, but I will now. Let's keep a discourse going. It seems like we have too many fleeting relationships and while we still have free and open internet, we should use it to connect with people, even if they aren't of the same mind.
