       r/the_donald collapses, the cult scurries over. Same thing happened with r/alt_right. His name was Seth Rich is the new Pizzagate is Real. We've seen this before, and these are both election hangovers. Had "spirit cooking" picked up any real steam it would be included.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I don't think you guys want to find whoever killed Seth, you just want to prove that the DNC did it. Do you realize you're doing the actual Kremlin's work for them, spreading doubt and counter-conspiracies? The CIA would do/likely has done the same thing in foreign countries, feeding notions to hungry factions, sowing instability and division, messing with reality. You don't think the GRU would do it here? It's right out of the "Gerasimov Doctrine."
      </p>
      <p>
       Try and take a grand view of this shit. It doesn't mean you have to stop supporting Trump or looking for Rich's killer.

       Proving Seth Rich's leaking to Wikileaks, blows out the Russian Narrative. That's all I want right now. But I seriously want the killer arrested and to spill all he/she knows. The Clintonista web/family ties is destroying democracy a lot more than people unjustly think Trump is doing.

       It doesn't take out the Russia narrative at all. There's misremembering about the DNC being the only hack of significance. 2 state voter reg systems were hacked, many more had attempted hacks. Multiple other Dem officials, including but not limited to Podesta. Trump opponents in the primaries were targeted.

       Again, no it does not.  I don't think the DNC was hacked by Russians, I do think the Russians were part a  propaganda piece to smear our elections more than they already were.  So all the BS posts on Facebook, Reddit, I think they were involved in a social media war, Trumps campaign very well could have been colluding with them on that.  Also the DNC emails were released by Wikileaks(I thought) so the who hacked them is irrelevant at this point. But having a possible compromised POTUS administration is very important.
      </p>
      <p>
       Want to know why there are so many corrupt politicians,  guess what, they are all compromised in one way or another, it just at a local corporate level and not by an international government.

       And if Russia did do propaganda during the election, how is it any different than the US interfering in overseas elections? It's fine when Obama tells Britain to remain when it's none of his business? And what evidence is there that Trump's campaign colluded? MEANWHILE, there is evidence of Hillary Clinton/Obama having henchmen galore smearing Bernie during the primaries and now focused on Trump.
      </p>
      <p>
       Correct The Record, Media Matters, Shareblue, spearheaded by David Brock, is on the war path to spread disinformation and distractions against the President and conservatives alike. He's been a smear artist for decades and is a very close friend of the Clintons as well as John Podesta (Hillary's campaign manager). Interesting enough, Podesta now works at the Washington Post. I wonder how those scoops this week (with no proof, just hearsay) came together?

       and what are you going to say when WL has no choice but to acknowledge Seth Rich was their source? Everybody already knows it, they're only not saying it yet out of the fact that they previously promised not to reveal sources, but these are extenuating circumstances that will force their hand.
      </p>
      <p>
       The writing is already on the wall, there's a mountain of circumstantial evidence connecting everything here. At this point, acting like Seth Rich wasn't murdered for political reasons is shilling.

       It's possible, though no one has produced a shred of real evidence, including Assange, Craig Murray, Kimdotcom, the Pede army. It's all just claims thus far. No one has been able to get close to proving Rich leaked anything, let alone that he was murdered for it. Really it's the same info from the election era with sad bouts of disinfo thrown in, like that Fox News idiot just offered.

       There are suspicions and motivations that would foster investigations, of course, just like the Trump/Russia stuff.

       And that's the difference folks. The "russian conspiracy" gets 24/7 media play and is parroted by the same people salty with the election results, and is backed by anonymous sources. Seth Rich's murder destorys the Russian Narrative and exposes the deep corruption of the clinton machine that has been a topic of conversation in politics for the last 36 years.

       The burden of proof lies on the accuser, not the accused. His name was Seth Rich and John Podesta of Hillary's campaign had him killed using dumb oaf of a union worker to murder him. Something i can prove to you though? Hillary Clinton will never be your presedent, and her loss was devistating.  Keep touting that Russian narrative though seems to be doing you so much good. 😂😂😂

       It's okay to be suspicious but If you take that conspiracy to its logical conclusion its completely far-fetched. Do you honestly think he's being extorted by the Russians, them holding some piece of information about him to force him to make favorable policies towards Putin? Why would Trump even had run for President in the first place if he knew he could be potentially extorted? Unless you of course subscribe to the idea that he did it all on purpose and is working secretly for Putin take down America and place Russia as the #1 superpower.
      </p>

       It just sound pretty dumb and far-fetched to me, but hey it

       No, probably not. I think he's got funding he doesn't want anyone to know about, and maybe it's connected to the Russian mob, or Chabad. I think the treason hysterics and general Trump/Russia stuff are schemes to get a look at his financials/investigate shell companies, potential money laundering, other white collar financial crimes. Mike Flynn will be thrown under the bus so no other investigations can persist.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also think they made big mistakes and self-inflicted wounds during the campaign re: Russia, things that make them look suspicious and motivated the very real current investigations. If they end up getting exonerated, I'll move on.

       The way I see it is that Trump is a billionaire, his taxes will probably reveal the typical rich man corrupt shtick (money laundering, shell companies, havens, etc.) probably some deals with Russia here and there in the past too, the guy is a businessman. He doesn't want to reveal his taxes for these reasons.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also think he didn't even knew very well the team that he picked out, probably they were just recommended and he approved, later found out about all their associations with Russia and is trying to distance himself from them etc. Now he looks like he's trying to "cover things" because he doesn't think and acts on impulse.
      </p>
      <p>
       And yeah I don't trust Trump either but at the same time a coup to try to take him out it's real, the leaking every day, MSN almost unamously going on with the Russia thing. Never seen that before, I don't think he's that bad as the reaction he's getting. But oh well, I'm sure you disagree, so let's just leave it at that :)

       Absolutely true. I'm here to speculate, not blatantly promote or simply to slander, or spam. I could care less how many people support my reasoning or suspicions, I want to discuss topics and figure shit out, be told I'm wrong when I'm off base. This place has been a rhetorical nightmare, and it will get worse. As long as people want to speculate and not simply circlejerk, I'm down.

       The reason for this to anyone that doesn't agree or understand is that NOISE makes it a lot harder to find good information and discussion which are the truest qualities of this sub.

       We discuss everything and try to leave emotion and identity politics at the door because the enemy is much more concentrated than we've been fooled into believing.

       Labeling people "liberals" is divisive speaking.  Nobody is a true liberal or conservative.  Those are lent words from a corporate news cycle from long ago that get rally cried and people get generalized by however they are portrayed en masse.

       Oooh, that's a good deflection.

       You know, if you weren't just trying to pretend your a user of this sub and those evil
       <a href="/r/The_Donald">
        /r/The_Donald
       </a>
       users have "taken over".

       It's good to know that you guys don't come to
       <a href="/r/Conspiracy">
        /r/Conspiracy
       </a>
       enough to pretend to "know the culture" here though. Especially when your only interactions are

       I don't necessarily think it's a deflection. Just an example for you to see my usual browsing and posting habits. I don't really care if you think that I'm a shill or whatever it is that you're implying about me.

       In fact I'm not even sure what it is that were arguing over. I only just now realized that you're not the original person that I was replying to. You do realize that you and I are actually arguing for the same side, right?

       Absolutely true. I'm here to speculate, not blatantly promote or simply to slander, or spam. I could care less how many people support my reasoning or suspicions, I want to discuss topics and figure shit out, be told I'm wrong when I'm off base. This place has been a rhetorical nightmare, and it will get worse. As long as people want to speculate and not simply circlejerk, I'm down.
