<p>Wikileaks file explaining exactly how Mossad infiltrated terrorist organizations and then used that cover to hijack US planes:</p>

<p>Claims that suadi Arabians are in reality fake Muslims. They are in fact Zionists. That is why they work with Israel:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.conspiracyschool.com/blog/2002-iraqi-intel-reported-wahhabis-are-jewish-origin">http://www.conspiracyschool.com/blog/2002-iraqi-intel-reported-wahhabis-are-jewish-origin</a></p>

<p>Claims Isis is run by Mossad, CIA, and MI6. </p>

<p>9-11 planes were switched out midair with exact replicas which were packed with explosives. Funny how this idea was used on HBOs Homeland tv show. </p>

<p>Since the patriot act was written because of a false flag, the writing of the act alone is treason. </p>

<p>Comey was fired because he had all the proof of what really happened on 9-11 and did nothing. </p>

<p>Wars in the Middle East are over a stargate found in the 1920s inside Iraq. The first Iraq war was fought to see if the stargate really exists. </p>

<p>Chelsie manning was trying to disclose the stargate in the Middle East. This stargate is now surrounded in a green zone. </p>

<p>Whabbism was made by Britian. It is really talmudism. Most Arab US allies follow this religion. Britian also created Israel at the request of Rothschild. </p>

<p>VictoryOfLight called out prince Phillip for being corrupt and so he leaves office immediately:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.breitbart.com/london/2017/05/04/duke-edinburgh-stepping-public-life-aged/">http://www.breitbart.com/london/2017/05/04/duke-edinburgh-stepping-public-life-aged/</a></p>

<p>Israel tried to start WW3 with another 9-11 style false flag but trump warned Russia in time. This is why the media is fuming and calling for impeachment. </p>

<p>The tweets are still incoming as I write this here:</p>

<p><a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/KibBitzLaw">https://mobile.twitter.com/KibBitzLaw</a></p>

<p>He also mentioned a massive writeup he&#39;s working on specifically for this sub and that a massive disclosure is incoming soon. In the meantime, a lot more is happening in the background than we can possibly imagine. </p>

<p>Edit: And for the grand finale, here is the missle that struck the pentagon. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Seriously. So much new stuff! Also, personally I&#39;ve been coming across some incredibly interesting older stuff that I have somehow completely missed in my 8+ years of research. It really feels like I&#39;m getting information downloads a la The Matrix, and a lot of other people are feeling the same way. It&#39;s super interesting. For the first time in a few years I can feel a small flame of hope igniting in my chest, it feels like the house of cards is getting pretty wobbly. It&#39;s going to be an interesting year!</p>

<p>That is the pdf where your material comes from. When I first read it way back when, I thought this is nuts, it&#39;s too crazy and too ordinary to be true. No aliens, no Illuminati secret clubs, just plain old stupid human greed.</p>

<p>I wanted to not believe it, but every single claim he makes is documented. Even I don&#39;t have time to verify his 100&#39;s of foot notes in his 10 page appendix. The names, places and dates checkout. This is truly the Mother of All Conspiracies. And the oldest. We may never know the Truth.</p>

<p>May you live in interesting times...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think that is so wickedly important. There have been secret societies, there are aliens, etc., but the intrigue around them is to mask the money; money is the majick. People can squabble about who, exactly, is in charge, but r/conspiracy would be a dead sub if the Western monetary system and fiat currency collapsed under their own absurdity. No one&#39;s going to do TPTB&#39;s dirty work without tax-free cash, for starters... </p>

<p>Thank you for the PDF link, and I&#39;m still doing random searches for that video.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s the point of the explosives</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Why did the events of 911 happen on 911? Was this a &quot;date specific&quot; event?</p></li>
<li><p>Yes, the event was specific to 9/11/2001.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>911 happened on 911 because on 9/12/2001 two hundred and forty billion dollars in fraudulent securities became due and payable by the US treasury and paying those securities would have exposed the necessary links in 100s of massive, global international money laundering schemes and 100s of elected and non-elected officials would have gone to prison based on 100s of current and ongoing investigations at that time. Evidence of money laundering, arms sales, drug sales, violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and many more crimes were destroyed forever.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>100s of elected and non-elected officials would have gone to prison?</p></li>
<li><p>Yes. The FBI, the CIA, the SEC, Customs, the Secret Service, IRS, the Office Of Naval Intelligence, banking regulators and global intelligence organizations as well as a number of other government agencies were tracking the money laundering activities related to gold market manipulation and global international money laundering. The &quot;Eldorado Task Force&quot; was a group of 55 intergovernmental agencies devoted to investigating international money laundering. These investigations all began after 1989 and were tracking years of fraudulent but very sophisticated money laundering schemes. ALL investigations were immediately halted on 9/12/2001 because not only was ALL of the evidence destroyed but 100s of the government and non-government investigators were also killed.</p></li>
<li><p>Did anything unusual happen on 9/12/2001?</p></li>
<li><p>Yes. For the first time in US history the Federal Reserve cleared 240 billion dollars in securities ANONYMOUSLY thanks to the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Securities and Exchange Commission invoked its emergency powers under SEC Act Section 12(k) and eased regulatory restrictions for the clearance of international securities on 9/11/2001. Think about that. The Federal Reserve allowed an anonymous individual or individuals to be paid 240 billion dollars in US denominated funds without revealing their names, location or legal status. As a result of the events of 911 George Bush, the SEC and the Federal Reserve approved the dispensing of &quot;Securities Clearance&quot; laws, for less then 15 days, a presidential approved breach of National Security, for the first time in history.</p></li>
<li><p>Why did George Bush and the Federal Reserve do this?</p></li>
<li><p>In 1989 a scheme was devised to end the Cold War and destroy the Soviet Union. The plan included crashing the currency and thus the economy, buying up the Soviet infrastructure at pennies on the dollar and leaving the Soviet Union a shell of its former self. The plan worked. In order to promote a sophisticated plan to crash the economy of the Soviet Union a massive amount of money was needed and the Federal Reserve, the SEC and with the blessings of George Bush, approved the counterfeiting of 240 billion dollars in bearer bonds, commonly referred to as Brady Bonds. This scheme was covered fully under &quot;National Security.&quot; There were 4 parts to this &quot;National Security&quot; scheme:</p></li>
</ol>

<p>a. Theft of the Soviet Treasury</p>

<p>b. Currency Destabilization of the Ruble</p>

<p>c. Funding the KGB Generals 1991 coup against Gorbachev</p>

<p>d. Takeover of key Soviet energy and defense industries by Western powers</p>

<ol>
<li><p>What exactly did they do once the bonds were floated?</p></li>
<li><p>Using various global intelligence assets, foreign banks and large international corporations with off-shore accounts, like Enron, but many others, they destroyed the Russian Ruble causing its value to plunge. They then bought oil, gas, steel and commodities exporters, major technological institutions and water, electric and agricultural firms within the Soviet Union. By buying up the infrastrusture (energy and defense) and then selling off the assets the economic viability of the Soviet Union was destroyed.</p></li>
<li><p>What were the 3 primary reasons for 911?</p></li>
<li><p>The first and foremost reason for the events of 911 was to conceal the identities of the 100s of intelligence assets, international bankers, elected officials and international players involved in the demise of the Soviet Union and to prevent the exposure of a &quot;National Security&quot; event, the destruction of the Soviet Union. The 2nd reason behind the events of 911 was to end for all time the ongoing investigations by numerous government and non-government organizations into these money laundering and gold market manipulations. The 3rd reason behind 911 was to provide the cover to allow for vilification of Islam and for blame to be placed on Islamic Fundamentalists allowing for public opinion to support extended wars to acquire global petroleum and mining resources.</p></li>
<li><p>Were the several planes targeting specific locations?</p></li>
<li><p>Yes. Each plane on 911 had specific targets all of which were hit with great precision. There were 3 major securities brokers in the Twin Towers, Cantor Fitzgerald (largest in US), Eurobrokers and Garbon Intercapital. Flight 11 hit the North Tower right below the offices of Cantor Fitzgerald destroying all records of securities transactions. Cantor Fitzgerald was the primary target. Flight 175 hit the South Tower below the offices of Eurobrokers and while this all took place massive explosions were reported in the North Tower under FBI offices on the 23rd floor and under Garbon Intercapital on the 25th floor again destroying any and all securities records. Flight 77 hit the Pentagon targeting the Office Of Naval Intelligence where investigators were working on illegal international financial schemes based out of the offices of Cantor Fitzgerald, Eurobrokers and Garbon Intercapital. Flight 77 not only destroyed all records related to these investigations but it also killed 39 of the 40 Naval Intelligence Investigators. The flight that crashed in Pennsylvania missed its target, building 7. All certificates for US bonds and other securities were completly destroyed.</p></li>
<li><p>Since this was a murder are there clues if we examine the fatalities?</p></li>
<li><p>Yes. Forty-One percent of the fatalities in the Twin Towers came from the two corporations that managed US government securities, Cantor Fitzgerald and Eurobrokers. Thirty-One percent of the fatalities at the Pentagon were from the Naval Command Center that housed the office of Naval Intelligence where 39 of 40 investigators were killed.</p></li>
<li><p>How is this cover-up maintained?</p></li>
<li><p>The event was a &quot;National Security&quot; event. Anyone connected whether media or elected officials are given the excuse that &quot;National Security&quot; is and was at stake and that&#39;s all that needs to be said. 911 hides the purposeful destruction of the Soviet Economy, massive crimes attached to that, and the need for a massive crime to cover up these massive crimes.</p></li>
<li><p>Who was involved?</p></li>
<li><p>I&#39;m going to list the major players in no specific order. Please remember, the events of 911 were designed to cover up illegal global international financial activity by many people, both elected and non-elected, whose privileged lives were about to go up in smoke, whose pampered lifestyles would have, if not for 911, been reduced to a life in prison. In essence, 911 was a National Security event designed to cover other National Security events, or, depending upon your perspective, a massive crime to cover even more massive crimes.</p></li>

<p>The Russian/Israeli Mafia</p>

<p>These people referred to themselves as the &quot;Vulcans.&quot; The covert operations conducted by the Vulcans involved - at a minimum - securities fraud, money laundering and violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. In a number of cases murder and false imprisonment (see Leo Wanta) seemed to be the mainstay of efforts to prevent any remorseful participants from going public with their stories. While accomplishing the objective - bringing about the demise of the Soviet Union - the scheme also seems to have lined the pockets of the individuals that executed the policies at US taxpayer expense.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>One obvious problem with all of this is a middle hit the pentagon, not a plane. And what if the plane that fell in Pennsylvania? Was it&#39;s target the ground? No mention of the greater Israel project? Larry Silverstein knowing both buildings had a crazy amount of asbestos and taking out multi billion dollar insurance policies? This leaves out so many key pieces to what/why things happened that dreadful day  </p>

<p>The towers required some $200 million in renovations and improvements, most of which related to removal and replacement of building materials declared to be health hazards in the years since the towers were built. It was well-known by the city of New York that the WTC was an asbestos bombshell. For years, the Port Authority treated the building like an aging dinosaur, attempting on several occasions to get permits to demolish the building for liability reasons, but being turned down due the known asbestos problem. Further, it was well-known the only reason the building was still standing until 9/11 was because it was too costly to disassemble the twin towers floor by floor since the Port Authority was prohibited legally from demolishing the buildings.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sounds like 0 facts. What is the cost of removing the asbestos? Were they required by law to remove the asbestos? How much asbestos was there?</p>

<p>It&#39;s just shill talk &quot;omg because the buildings were still standing therefore it must be due to asbestos otherwise they would have demolished the building thus proving the asbestos&quot;</p>

<p>Where did u get this? This is interesting, did you hear this police recording:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Huf2Kz7bV2k">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Huf2Kz7bV2k</a></p>

<p>PS. some more info, some of what you wrote is right some is wrong:</p>

<p>911 was a cheap magic trick.</p>

<p>A Pentagon employee crawled through the hole and saw no evidence of a plane:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIy9hjB3DGk">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIy9hjB3DGk</a></p>

<p>Major General Stubblebine confirms that the wreckage at the pentagon is consistent with a missile and not a plane:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jc1ql4TfCZw">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jc1ql4TfCZw</a></p>

<p>This WTC witness insists it was a bomb, no plane:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bq1-BCeNcm0">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bq1-BCeNcm0</a></p>

<p>These firemen said they counted 3 explosions. The Police/FBI are reported to have attributed this to vans with explosives in the WTC basement:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfxkcBmZfK0">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfxkcBmZfK0</a></p>

<p>You can also see raw footage (ie. not altered to show a CG plane) that shows the missile impacting the WTC (no plane):</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wF74zTLjNg">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wF74zTLjNg</a></p>

<p>You can see a comparison showing the NBC footage showing no plane was digitally altered to show a plane (as well as adjust the colors to make the buildings appeared white and sky blue for increased psychological impact):</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPKq2K2dh6k">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPKq2K2dh6k</a></p>

<p>The altered footage in some cases is obviously fake, for example tiling smoke:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkzfKRe0gbc">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkzfKRe0gbc</a></p>

<p>But what wasn&#39;t CG was the explosions and the plane cutout shape they created. You can see those small explosions here (6 minute mark):</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rT1z90BB8E4&amp;amp;feature=endscreen&amp;amp;NR=1">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rT1z90BB8E4&amp;amp;feature=endscreen&amp;amp;NR=1</a></p>

<p>The cutting charges were planted by Israeli Mossad posing as art students who rented a whole floor and got construction permits at the site, and made a temporary balcony. They even made a book about their &quot;art&quot; - which showed them standing next to boxes and boxes of explosives fuses in the WTC!</p>

<p><a href="http://winteractionables.com/?p=25207">http://winteractionables.com/?p=25207</a></p>

<p>Mossad agents filmed the missile impacts/explosions (to add CG planes later and pass on to media) and later went up to the roof to plant radio jamming devices. They were arrested and this is documented by the FBI. There was traces of explosives in their van and they were set up filming BEFORE the attack:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.scribd.com/collections/4010452/9-11-The-Dancing-Israelis-FBI-report">https://www.scribd.com/collections/4010452/9-11-The-Dancing-Israelis-FBI-report</a></p>

<p>Let me stress that again, the FBI arrested dancing Israelis on 911, not muslims. They refused to take lie detector tests for months, and when they did, they failed. So much of that FBI report is redacted, proof positive of guilt.</p>

<p>They needed to fake plane impacts because a real plane would be shredded by the WTC like cheese through a grater. That&#39;s why when the Transasia plane collided with a taxi, the wing broke off, and the taxi wasn&#39;t sliced in half at all:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQ29Zr7wWnw">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQ29Zr7wWnw</a></p>

<p>According to a WTC architect in a 80s interview, the impact of a plane (300 tonnes) is nothing compared to the 13,000 tonnes of force trying to push the WTC over simply because of its enormous surface area.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E15GbdVaV-Q">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E15GbdVaV-Q</a></p>

<p>WTC project management engineer atttests the buildings could survive multiple plane impacts.</p>

<p>The WTC designers did a study for 600mph-1 impact which showed the towers would easily withstand the 911 attack.</p>

<p>Someone planted an engine (though wrong make) to further the plane deception:</p>

<p>Essentially the media got punked by Israel, because journalists just report what they&#39;re told. You can see another example of newscasters being fooled by a movie set into thinking it&#39;s a real plane accident. At the 7 minute mark in this video:</p>

<p>The larger 911 plan required the destruction of the Washington bridge and Lincoln tunnel. That would take out the fiber optic cables linked to stock market/banking, markets would have crashed and there would be martial law introduced. You can see this TV report on the other Israeli vans that were intercepted, one of them exploded:</p>

<p>Israeli companies moved out of the building months before the attack. Israelis in America were warned in advance through an Israeli messaging service:</p>

<p>Hundreds of Israelis were flown out of America, despite a flight ban, to avoid them being arrested by the FBI, including the &quot;art students&quot;:</p>

<p>Israel is the almost only country that benefited from the September 11 th attacks. In the words of Netanyahu, &quot;it&#39;s good for Israel&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The above wikileaks/stratfor link is a wayne madsen article &quot;Mossad ran 9/11 Arab hijacker operation&quot; (great read).  Destroying evidence of financial fraud and making a $240 bln killing on stocks on the back end makes more sense than the UBL fairy tale.  The Israeli-Victor Bout link makes sense out of why the US reacted so harshly on Bout.  The US case vs. Bout always seemed contrived imo--blaming Bout for supplying planes for Colombian drug dealers(?)--easiest trick in the book.  </p>

<p>If even parts of this are true--then the US is now just a bank and &quot;the muscle&quot; for the Israelis, who tell the US Treasury what to pay them and control where WAR, INC. USA goes next.</p>

<p>...also makes sense out of Cynthia McKinnon&#39;s stating that shortly after 9/11 all members of Congress were called to the Senate--where the senators and representatives noticed Mossad agents...</p>
