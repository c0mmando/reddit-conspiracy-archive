        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>And by heart I mean a core group of members, tagged both left and right. You&#39;ll always have your normal level of reddit spam, but after you filter that out, you start to see patterns. </p>

<p>Past the reddit spam you have the organized resistance. They push the narratives, along with their bots, in sync with the MSM (how dare you question the venerable MSM), they work at 455 Mass and I have a standing offer to buy anyone beers over at the Engine if they want to hang out and chat.</p>

<p>Past that you have the zealots. Folks that truly are the stereotypical, misinformed, due to mental capacity or intentionally living in an echo chamber. You can&#39;t speak against any narrative that threatens their world view and you are A FUCKING SOMETHING OR RATHER eventually in the conversation.</p>

<p>Past that you have the karma farmers that are serial posters. They mean well but they are usually lightweight in offering actual substance.</p>

<p>And you have normal people mixed in that vary in their opinions, flutter around aimlessly, find themselves more confused and regret ever finding this sub.</p>

<p>But after you filter past all of that, there is a core group here that is truly trying to find some answers to questions they have in their lives. Sometimes you&#39;ll catch them in a short-lived post after they&#39;ve had a few drinks and share a bit more about their unique perspective in life. Even though that perspective may be vastly different than your own, it is coming from a real person. </p>

<p>This sub is being divided by multiple attack strategies. It&#39;s important to recognize bait and not take it. If you&#39;re 5 comments into a &quot;he said, she said&quot; thread, then it&#39;s likely that your opponent only serves to keep you distracted with simple trolling so your mind isn&#39;t thinking about what they don&#39;t want you to be thinking about.</p>

<p>Stay focused on your path and be wary of low effort distractions. Time is the most valuable thing you have but you&#39;re losing it by the second. Don&#39;t let a someone on a script steal your time away from you. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well put. If you want to be in that last group, you have to to some degree learn to recognize the various types of users here and learn to ignore them. Yes, trolls and shills exist on this sub, but they only have power to the extent we pay attention to them. Calling someone out as a shill only serves to slide the conversation and waste your time, which is precisely what they want. </p>

<p>If you feel someone&#39;s shilling or spreading disinfo, provide a simple counterargument, source your claim if possible, and then be willing to drop it if they&#39;re not arguing in good faith. The people you&#39;re really trying to reach, the other users and lurkers, will see whose argument makes more sense. You&#39;ve got to trust these other users to make up their own minds. </p>

They want to confuse us, divide us, and play on our emotions. Keep searching for the truth and light.

    <div class="md"><p>I resent astroturfing with a passion, and it is somewhat of a hobby of mine to study their techniques.</p>

<p>I used to think that the best way to fight them is to find the most effective ways to waste their time.</p>

<p>(For example, shills seem to be more likely to monitor new queues and to try to add their comments in the new threads early to increase their chances of having top comments in case the thread gets popular. So submitting links that would attract their interest in popular subs is a very cost-effective way to tie up shills&#39; time, even if your submission is downvoted.)</p>

<p>But I am more and more convinced that finding like minded people and supporting them is a lot more helpful. </p>

<p>Shills just add to the onslaught of gaslighting coming from corporate MSM and politicians. It actually does not take much to burst the bubble of lies. It takes a lot less effort to dispel the lie than it is to maintain it. People sense that they are being lied to and they only go along with it if there are no contradicting opinions. It only takes a few or even one contradicting opinion for those people to say to themselves that they are not crazy to have doubts.</p>

<p>Wasting shills&#39; time can be fun, but I think finding and talking to people who are not paid to promote a certain agenda has a lot more benefits.</p>

<p>And the less attention you give to shill infested subs the more obvious their echo-chambers become. The only attention they are worth is being ridiculed for allowing astroturfers to take over.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I found this sub in December. After the election, I was disenchanted with pretty much everything.</p>

<p>I voted for what I thought was the lesser of two evils, I got depressed, and I found this sub. I lurked without an account.</p>

<p>I thought pizzagate was a ridiculous name and premise, which is why I had to dive in, but I ended up joining the second wave of Voaters and helped spread that info. It then became too partisan and chaotic. I left and registered here around January or something.</p>

<p>I had always been interested in conspiracy theories, like D.B. Cooper, numbers stations, 9/11, the &quot;soft stuff&quot; that TPTB use to keep bluepills feeling like they&#39;ve got it figured out.</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t find that here. I found people fighting, the aftermath of sub bans and insane brigading. But between the garbage, under the armies of paid trolls, and within the gamut of hate, I found good people.</p>

<p>Good people that cared about their fellow enthusiasts, who wouldn&#39;t pull punches but would still be civil. Folks who would entertain different angles, and we&#39;re happy to provide new ones. I&#39;ve learned a lot from this sub&#39;s core users.</p>

<p>While I may not be one of them due to my lack of offering substantial content (difficulty concentrating, might need meth pills), I try my best to help others keep the levity with humor and asking questions to explore the topics at hand. We&#39;re a loose community, but a community nonetheless.</p>

<p>This post is great, and it&#39;s true.</p>

<p>If we want this sub to be here in a week, a month, a year, we need to maintain it. It can&#39;t all fall on the mods, and if you care about this place, you&#39;ll help enforce the rules and keep the quality flowing. It&#39;s when we give in to the ruckus that we risk losing it all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I really don&#39;t think the divisive attacks have any real power. It&#39;s a case of too little too late. We&#39;ve been banished to our once tiny sub years ago where we were free to report the trends. Now we have a pretty solid counter-narrative that is built on a fairly detailed analysis of the past 100 years of history. </p>

<p>What these shills don&#39;t understand is that we&#39;re out of their reach. We&#39;ve been marginalized and cajoled for years and it doesn&#39;t faze us anymore. We know the shit hits the fan everyonce in a while and the waters get muddy. In that case we just wait it out and pop back up when the sanity returns. </p>
