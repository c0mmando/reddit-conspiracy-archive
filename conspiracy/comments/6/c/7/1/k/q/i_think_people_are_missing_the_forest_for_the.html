        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">8</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2017-05-19 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/4ktvs.html">4ktvs</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Before I go into detail Putin is a Ex-KGB scum bag that is no hero and no one should treat him like one. On the other hand we have a crooked CIA, NSA and a highly questionable FBI that seemed to making moves based on shadow orders from above than on any actual hard data on the Hillary Email case. Then we have Trump that with all of his years in the reality TV show business has learned how most people tick and what the razor edge is for what he can say with out risking a total loss of support.</p>

<p>The point here is that Hillary was intended to lose and that Trump from the start was designed to take care of the most problematic part of the population for moving forward on the plans to start a war with Russia. This won&#39;t just suddenly happen tomorrow or even a few weeks from now but will be slowly building up to a story when all put together reads something to the effect of: &quot;The Russians need to go down&quot;. </p>

<p>The main issue I see is that people when seeing two factions in a disagreement want to label one of them as evil and the other one as good. The idea that both could be evil often isn&#39;t an easy concept for people to believe even more so when one of them promotes the idea that they are on their side. When really it&#39;s a battle of the evil&#39;s and more importantly no side should be taken because both are only for there own self interest. The KGB and CIA are both bad and anyone who even has a clue as to how they really work would know this. </p>

<p>But getting back to the main point we are in the middle of war mongering propaganda with Trump fully intending to fan it in his own way. Because he is an actor playing the role of a president that knew something about Russia but did nothing because of his ego. I have no idea what the detail&#39;s will be but it&#39;s likely going to be along the lines of claiming he knew some things and had vested business interest in Russia but shouldn&#39;t be removed for some reason like &quot;intent&quot; or something along those lines. He is the acting &quot;Hillary&quot; of the right designed to inflame those that lean left into war as it&#39;s normally harder to get them on the war bandwagon. The main stream media along with Trump has done a great job of destroying the anti-war core of those leaning left and on everything to do with Russia will only keep working toward this goal.</p>

<p>They also building up into this they will ramp up deployments of anti-missile systems and likely will false flag a hack into one or more other elections around the world blaming the Russian government kind of like the media has with the French election. </p>

<p>Unlike many people I am not into date setting so I won&#39;t say something like &quot;for sure WW3 is going to happen on June 11th at 9am because NYC will be nuked&quot;. </p>

<p>But I think a plan has long been set in motion that is leading the public into agreeing with the Deep state that Russia must go. It doesn&#39;t matter to them if I buy into this, but if the %99 of the public do. Right now the task is to get nearly everyone united against Russia because those in our military are just like the people in the public and won&#39;t agree to a first strike unless the media can put together a staged set of event&#39;s that gets people believing that:</p>

<p>1) Russia is out to get us.</p>

<p>2) We can win a war against them.</p>

<p>3) That it&#39;s the only reasonable choice.</p>

<p>Step 1 is clearly well underway and step 2 has been quietly in the works for a while but won&#39;t become open until the media gets close to the step of reporting Trump being &quot;officially&quot; guilty of working with the Russian government. </p>

<p>What will happen then is the media will talk a lot more about our missile defense systems and other assets that could be used to win in a nuclear war with Russian&#39;s if they don&#39;t become reasonable. People will be asking about M.A.D and the media will be hosting experts that will claim that with Russia being a regional power that this isn&#39;t the case anymore. </p>

<p>Have you heard the media use the term &quot;regional power&quot; when talking about Russia? Expect them to only promote this buzz word while at the same time claim that they have the geopolitical power to overturn the election of the most powerful super power on earth. </p>

<p>They like this term because it greatly blunts the fact they have a stockpile of 7,000+ nuclear weapons and suggest that because we are a &quot;super power&quot; and they are a &quot;regional power&quot; that a war could be won. </p>

<p>As for the 3rd part of needing to go into a war with Russia I think there is something to the drills we have been seeing but it&#39;s likely there will be a huge plain to see build up of Russia related news before it happens. It will likely happen after Trump having got off the hook for his own &quot;Russian&quot; related crimes will do something suddenly out the blue that really provokes Putin.</p>

<p>Then a nuclear false flag attack will be blamed on the Russian&#39;s providing a 3rd party with nuclear weapon&#39;s that really done with our own missiles or bomb that will just happen to be captured on video from above a Untied States city by one of our Military planes or satellites so that the media can run the story with video the moment after it happens while also reporting Trump ordering a all out counter strike following the event. </p>

<p>On the more conspiracy believing side of things I think they are trying to get people with the &quot;nuclear weapon hoax&quot; that has really been picking up steam along with flat earth theory. I think the idea here is to divide those who believe in conspiracy theory&#39;s between &quot;yes we can win against Russia because nuclear weapons are a hoax&quot; and &quot;No we will all die if a thermal nuclear war starts between Russia and the Untied states&quot;.</p>

<p>If you never heard of the nuclear weapons are a hoax theory a video on the subject below:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There were some details I left out as I am not the best writer but that was the idea. I just don&#39;t get why people don&#39;t think he could have been chosen because of being an actor that is great at getting under peoples skin. </p>

<p>I feel at times like his rude outrageous remarks are planned to build a story line plot that can also be used to drown out other news and divide people.  </p>

<p>I also think they needed a GOP president that looked friendly to Russia so that:</p>

<p>1) Russia might not fully expect it coming as they would have with Hillary.</p>

<p>2) Hillary&#39;s stance on Russia made it very clear she would be trigger happy and so people might not be willing to believe the staged set of event&#39;s. Trump on the other hand is cheered on when he makes hostile moves against Russia.</p>

<p>3) So that our Military would be willing to fire the nuclear weapon&#39;s. With %60+ being a part of the GOP it&#39;s slightly easier to get them behind Trump and after seeing how has &quot;tried&quot; to be friendly with Russia they are much more likely to fall in line once all the parts come together. This is key because they want to be sure that the &quot;grunt&#39;s&quot; will be willing to fully nuke Russia as they have to fly the planes, fire the missiles and so on to make it happen. </p>

I don&#39;t think even the MIC / Deep State wants a nuclear war with Russia, but I think they now think that a more limited war would be possible in some third country. I think that&#39;s pretty clear from Hillary&#39;s wish to have a Syrian no fly zone, and Trump&#39;s cruise missile idiocy. </p>
