They could get away before with shit like this but they may have fucked up enough and there may be too much evidence. Something along the line is going to be the smoking gun and Seth may be it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s an incredibly sad view of the world imo. You feel it&#39;s hopeless? They&#39;ve won, might as well just accept it? That&#39;s honestly the saddest thing I&#39;ve heard in a really long time, I can hardly believe I just read it on a conspiracy forum. I&#39;m curious, if it&#39;s not too personal, what makes life worth living for you? What gets you up in the morning? Do you have or plan to have kids? If so, how do you feel about the (seemingly) hopeless world with rising instability they will have to live in? The depletion of resources, the severe degradation present across the biosphere? Whether global warming, if it actually exists, is due to us is irrelevant. Whether the earth is heating, cooling, or staying the same, we are still delivering massive amounts of damage to the planet through our completely idiotic inefficiency, which only exists because the true efficiency we are scientifically capable of isn&#39;t profitable for the psychopaths.  Do you feel that you are free? If not, do you then merely accept your enslavement? I can not comprehend the acceptance of defeat given the circumstances we find ourselves in as a species. If you do feel you are free, well, I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll have anything else to say.</p>

There is no Clint Eastwood or John Wayne coming to ride into town and clean up the bandits.

Us all Running for office won&#39;t do anything either. You can&#39;t use a corrupt system to try and do good deeds from the inside. We must operate outside that political and societal system. </p>
