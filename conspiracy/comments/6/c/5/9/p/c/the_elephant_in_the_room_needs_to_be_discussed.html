        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>First off, fuck Hillary Clinton and fuck the DNC. And the ONLY reason I even have to say that is because this thread will <em>assuredly</em> be hijacked by astro-turfing forces just like every other thread. Those two entities can go fuck themselves but this isn&#39;t about them.</p>

<p>The elephant in the room is the Trump shilling. It&#39;s fucking BLATANT. The front page gets <em>flooded</em> with pro-Trump bullshit. And that&#39;s fine, it&#39;s not that this sub should ever bow to anyone. EVERYTHING is on the table: fake moon landings, Sept. 11 theories, Catholic church conspiracies, chemtrails and bio-engineering via our food supply etc etc.</p>

<p>.... except for one problem: it&#39;s ALL Trump. And usually, it&#39;s <em>all</em> PRO-Trump. </p>

<p>This sub is being absolutely ravaged by astro-turfing shills, bots and online trolls that spend insane amounts of time online shilling for Trump. And we all see it in every fucking thread. Every fucking single thread. </p>

<p>I <em>just</em> saw a gaggle of pro-trump lackeys throwing a bitch-fit about the &quot;Russia&quot; conspiracy against Trump because &quot;nothing you say counts as evidence... THIS IS ALL A CONSPIRACY!1!1!1&quot;. How is it the front page of this sub can be pro-Trump almost 24/7 but the second a discussion emerges about Trump&#39;s self-inflicted shitshow (which- BTW- is huge fucking news right now, how the fuck are people on this subreddit NOT supposed to talk about it? Should we just ignore it like it isn&#39;t dominating the news? Lol wow what could possibly be the agenda with wanting that, I wonder).. the second a discussion that is negative about him comes up, it&#39;s immediately attacked with downvotes, deflection, derailment and a sudden wave of concern trolling posts and &quot;DAE Feel like this sub is ignoring Seth Rich&quot; &quot;DAE shills?&quot; &quot;DAE believe the Russia thing is a conspiracy?&quot;</p>

<p>No shit sherlock. You&#39;re on r/conspiracy. Do these idiots even bother looking into what subs they&#39;re shilling on or do they just have a program that identifies mentions of Russia+Trump? </p>

<p>These groups are actively working against the spirit and purpose of this sub: to discuss conspiracies. 
Does the Trump-Russia connection have evidence? Yes- a shit ton.</p>

<p>... but even IF it didn&#39;t, THIS, of all places, would be the place to discuss it. </p>

<p>I am sick and tired of these online mob groups brigading into subs and hijacking them. I <em>implore</em> the moderators to DO something about it. PLEASE. </p>

<p>Save. This. Sub. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You need to do a bit of reading up on Putin&#39;s real motivations to know why <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> would basically applaud any cooperation with him - Russia is quickly becoming the world&#39;s last hope as a sovereign state with any actual power to change world affairs. </p>

<p>Read up more on Steve Piecnezik, his ties to &quot;Russia&quot; (ie. he helped orchestrate the fall of the Soviet Union, particularly the cultural/social engineering side) and how he claims to be the mastermind behind the Trump &quot;alliance&quot;. </p>

<p>Plus, here&#39;s some reading about why people would be cheering on Putin, rather than scared of him. The whole Cold War was fake, BTW, and Russia was never a real threat - US&#39;s GDP dominates theirs so hard they literally have no resources to make a credible military threat. However, they have really good HUMINT, and they have essentially collected all the &quot;puzzle pieces&quot; to New Babylon and they don&#39;t seem to agree with it. Thank god. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I used to be a HUGE Russia cheerleader because it was the only counter-point to the US, who I saw (and still see) as a MAJOR source of violent conflict in the world and an extremely oppressive, exploitative empire .... but my opinions on Russia have gone from rose-tinted glasses to bleak. </p>

<p>Russia may be a much needed obstacle to American empire, but it&#39;s no saint. Russia routinely jails people for &quot;hooliganism&quot;. Basically the epitome of &quot;trumped up charges&quot; for being disagreeable. They poison dissidents. They&#39;re authoritarian as fuck. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you follow the links, Russia alleges widespread problems with foreign NGO&#39;s trying to basically infiltrate the country and push for social change. The pushing for social change part isn&#39;t the problem, it&#39;s the foreign links (George Soros etc.) that usually get them arrested.</p>

<p>More to the point about Russia/Putin being authoritative, even excessively, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rStL7niR7gs">I suggest a good summary like this</a> about how sometimes people will opt to forgoe civil liberties in exchange for a more &quot;efficient&quot;/&quot;effective&quot; government. It&#39;s like letting Machiavelli run your country, if you will. Russia has gone from Tzars, to Communism (both Lenin, Trotsky, and Stalin&#39;s variants among others), back to &quot;democracy&quot;. They have elected a similar approach to Fascism, the extreme example of authoritarianism, where they are organizing for maximum effectiveness rather than &quot;most fun place to live&quot;. I&#39;m not saying Putin is a fascist, more along the lines of benevolent dictator, but he is clearly running a Machiavellian government that is achieving far more than anyone would expect out of a country with such low GDP - of course this leaves everyone to trust Putin, but if you understand that Russia isn&#39;t Putin and is basically founded on corruption, mafia-style government, people constantly overthrowing rich leaders etc. then maybe Putin&#39;s actions would seem more like &quot;what must be done with shitty circumstances&quot; rather than &quot;evil for the fun of it&quot;. </p>

<p>Basically, I see him as a benevolent dictator (except he&#39;s democratically elected, with a legitimately high approval rating) and that the Russian people know the &quot;trap of freedoms&quot; from their Communism days - they understand that the world is a shitty place, and you can&#39;t make a perfect bastion of freedoms and justice without rising to fight the external forces seeking to destroy those values (usually by promising you them). </p>

<p>It&#39;s weird, but there&#39;s certainly more to Putin (ex-special forces) than meets the eyes. He&#39;s seen some weird shit. All I know is he seems like he is on humanity&#39;s side. </p>

<p>This is straight out of the Republican partisan internet machine. George Soros becomes <em>the face</em> of anti-Russia for the simple reason that it is all we hear about.</p>

<p>In fact, the anti-Russia policy comes directly from official government policy written in 1992 by the George Bush administration -- and carried out by both parties since.</p>

<p>Money pours into the anti-Russia by government (like USAID) and by Republican oligarchs (like Koch brothers) too.</p>

<p>George Soros is a small piece of the pie -- and a deflection from general conspiracy to partisan propaganda. :)</p>

If you consider Russia authoritarian then best look at America, jailing whisltle blowers and interfering with democratically voted governments is more authoritarian than Russia. Putin halted adoptions in Russia because Americans were abusing adopted Russian children, he stopped ambassadors from promoting transgender issues to children. He said that topic has no place with children. he seems to have his priorities in order when it comes to protecting his nation and not selling it to the highest bidder.

<p>They facilitated the hostile, monetized takeover of all the top subs. Then they changed the algorithm to support Hillary Clinton, closed down r/pizzagate and r/operation_berenstein to name a few. They made the r/popular category which is a fucking censored joke. They lie about the subscriber counts to everyone except their advertisers to gaslight people into thinking they have no support. They allow blatant bot upvoting on cringey new anti-Trump subs every day. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>.... are they? I never saw ANYONE from Reddit saying what you said. I NEVER saw a declaration of war.</p>

<p>Furthermore, Reddit is a private company that can do <strong>what ever the hell it wants</strong>.... so it&#39;s beyond asinine to suggest Reddit is engaging in some kind of high school-caliber game with The_Donald. </p>

<p>If they wanted to kick them all off, they would. If they wanted to shut down that sub, they would. If they wanted to flair every single poster of the sub with &quot;retard&quot; ... THEY WOULD.</p>

<p>So it&#39;s laughable to hear you talking about &quot;Reddit declaring war on Trump supporters&quot; when the ONLY indication of some kind of concerted effort/attack comes from 1. Trump supporters on Reddit 2. the Donald moderators and 3. Yourself. </p>

<p>YOU said there&#39;s an effort against Reddit. You JUST said that. Not Reddit. Although it&#39;s actions against The Don are clearly antagonistic.... they never declared an open conflict with that userbase.</p>

<p>YOU and Trump supporters and Trump sub mods did. </p>

<p>Don&#39;t deflect now. Your words are right up there 👆🏾</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Several users expressed enthusiasm at the discovery in the comment section.</p>

<p>Vivalad:,  “looks like someone&#39;s either lying to their advertisers or lying to their customers”</p>

<p>JTPri123:, “I was going to be thrilled with us apparently having 700k. You can&#39;t put this lighting back in the bottle now.”</p>

<p>Deplorable_Paladin: “I can confirm this, I just tried it.”</p>

<p>A few others had a bit of hesitation.</p>

<p>feyrbrand: “i just checked a few other subreddits and they are all massively inflated on the ads. site. not exactly as much as this one, but still a lot.”</p>

<p>SrSkippy: “Is that subscribers or unique impressions? Perhaps their category title is simply incorrect?”</p>

<p>The displayed screenshot definitely shows the disparity in the numbers provided by Reddit. However, when Conservative News tried to duplicate the process on Reddit Ads, the numbers in the subreddits section did not show actual subscribers, but “daily impressions,” as in the average visits to the thread. It is unclear why two different &quot;subscribers&quot; are listed in one and &quot;daily impressions&quot; are listed in the other.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Your source said it wasn&#39;t able to confirm that and the only person that they cite is some random user named TRUMP. As we all know, it&#39;s easy to photoshop. </p>

<p>So it&#39;s curious how no one has been able to verify that claim. I&#39;m going to conclude that the &quot;6 million user&quot; claim is unsupported and not verified. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have seen many anti trump threads to be fair. I simply think there is a major conflict between the deep state and trump and most here are rooting for the guy who believes 911 was an inside job, the guy who wants vaccines investigated, the same guy who said said too many children were disappearing and that pedos need to have short trials and strong sentences. These are all active issues that are being researched on this sub. Trump seems to share similar priorities that users have on this sub. I don&#39;t see it as shilling. Passions are running high: Seth rich murder is relevant, Vince foster murder is relevant, assange and weiner and podesta are all relevant topics that people care about. Many here hope trump can trump the deep state. It&#39;s a hot topic. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>lol what. I don&#39;t ever see pro-Trump anything, like ever. Did you see the post where 92% of all the airtime on CNN is given to bashing Trump? I&#39;ll never understand where those very vocal few get the impression that there&#39;s shilling going on for &quot;the right&quot; when all we see is a very concerted effort to make us hate them. I <em>have</em> hated them for a long time, but in light of all of this, I&#39;m having to continuously call bullshit on these Dur Russia accusations, which is really weird. A position I&#39;d never think I&#39;d find myself in and one I don&#39;t like, but it&#39;s the closest I can get to what&#39;s actually going on, so I stay here, operating on a simple principle of &quot;that which institutions choose to tell you usually benefits them&quot;. </p>

<p>Try looking into each of these conspiracies to see what you think for yourself, maybe you&#39;ll understand why there are all these people like &quot;this is retarded in 97 ways and today I will talking about way 42-45&quot;. </p>
