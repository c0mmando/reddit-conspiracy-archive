       Yeah, you've recommended that YouTube video already... The fact you can recommend that video so much in one thread either says you've been mentally compromised in some fashion, or you're trying to get more YouTube views and likes..if so, recreate your profile and/or repost the video to give the sense that someone is censoring you some more..

       No, if someone wants to learn about this issue, or at least perceive the side being argued, they will read through everything. Someone that doesn't take the time to read this thread isn't going to take the time to watch a 2.5hr video.

       What is the point of different geography on a flat Earth? Volcanoes, mountains, the weather? Is the sun on a track system if we're going to go back to the idea we're in the center? How do you explain different constellations in different hemispheres? How the hell do we not fall off or crash into the edge when sailing or flying around the world?

       There is this awesome documentary about geocentricism called The Principle. It even features some famous physicists and you would may like it. They talk about the cosmic background radiation and how it proves that the cosmos are actually aligned to Earth. Check it out, the CMB proves the Big Bang to be a crock of shit.

       I can't explain this as of yet, if I had to guess I would say it has to do with atmospheric lensing. What I CAN say is that you can't convince me the shape of what I'm standing on by showing me what is above me - that is a fallacy.

       Another highly philosophical question. Don't ask me why we have mountains, volcanoes, and magnetic fields. That is akin to asking why we are here at all.

       No, the explanation of how geography functions doesn't compare to the reason for life..I was asking how geography works in your world, and those answers are very relevant to proving the point.

       It was a dumb question to begin with. Why should the magnetic field work differently on a flat Earth than it would on a globe Earth. Tell me your explanation of gravity for the globe, and my answer to you is the same.

       So why are there certain types of geography doesn't equate to how is there geography? And why equates to a philosophical question, while how is a practical question?

       Polaris, or the north star, is not view-able in the southern hemisphere.  The northern hemisphere can't see many constellations that the southern can, and vice versa, because we live on a sphere.

       Ill agree that the celestial sphere is very hard to explain, and i do not have a 100% working model of the flat earth so i cant give you a sure answer. But what i can say is that the shape of the heavens do not tell us the shape of the Earth. You cant convince me the shape of what i am standing on by showing me what is above me - that is a fallacy.

       The same stars are not visible at different latitudes, especially above and below the equator. Gyroscopes, very carefully measured, will reveal the rotation of the earth (hence the name). Aircraft flight times do not reveal some alternate geometry. And there's no reason to lie about the Earth being round or flat or tetrahedral or whatever; who stands to gain from that?

       Let's see, off the top of my head, Seth Rich info came out, Roger Ailes died, the singer from Soundgarden died, Trump bombed Syria while no one was looking, and Chinese planes intercepted American planes in an aggressive way which could start WWIII.  The entire week has been huge news after huge news.

       T_D mods threw a hissy fit and closed the sub. They complained that they're subject to rules that nobody else is subject to, and three of their mods were suspended for breaking them (to clarify, many subs that have users who brigade or dox are put under additional scrutiny and told to take measures to stop it, and while most subs at least go through the motions T_D decided to REEEEE and encouraged their users to further break the rules).

       But how does that answer the question? He asked if he's missing out of something. That sub doing whatever it is doing isn't important, at all. They're entitled little shits who act exactly like the people they hate when met with any sort of push back.

       No. Nothing has happened. Nothing has ever happened. People just think what they are interested in at the moment is more important to discuss. Also, a large collective of people here want posters only discussing certain topics. Topics deemed acceptable by tptb.

       I've been reading and watching and studying this topic for about 7 months...it's intriguing and it ties some loose ends on so many levels.  Depends how deep you wanna go into the levels of conspiracy and prophecy. Glass ceilings and Antarctica and the Biblical firmament.  So many layers... the universe as a timepiece and the Sun and the Moon of the Earth as the arms of a 24 hour clock.... sorry if I sound crazy but it's 4am and I'm only awake because my four year old wet the bed.

       I am almost certain it is flat. If you want my full opinion, please read

        this
       </a>
       comment of mine. As reddit is an echo chamber, the prevailing beliefs get pushed to the top and this makes flat earth discussion difficult, although not impossible. People in conspiracy are way more open minded than the outsiders, and it is totally possible to get some of the people here to question what they've been told and investigate further. The comment of mine that I linked contains all the information that i think one needs to hear to consider that they may have been lied to.

       I really can't tell if this is an ultimate level of trolling or not..if it's not, it doesn't surprise me to see that religion, typically the Bible, is one of the top source materials..as well as half-assed YouTube videos.

       It's just strange that science and physics can be considered belief systems..but I get it based on the history of scientific culture.

       Yeah a lot of people immediately turn to the Bible after realizing the flat earth since it makes the flat earth claim as well, and even warns us of a grand deception. Although it does contain some good teachings, I am very wary of what the Bible has to say.

       Yeah, every other thing in space, but Earth is a disk. Pretty fucking obvious because when I look up at planets they're sphere's but when I look out at the earth it's flat. I better add a /s tag, because flat earthers are FAR too stupid to detect it.

       It's oblique, like Neil DeGrasse ' s mom. See what happens is where you have a ball spinning on a focal point and unlimited amounts of 'space' for it to expand it will. Again, Neil's sweet sweet moms is working a pole, the thickness propelling like a spinning top.  The constant rotation appears as a ball but it is and never will be still for a exact picture. Reeducating the years of never questioning our authoritarian indoctrination is hard.  But so was learning the bullshit.

       But how does that answer the question? He asked if he's missing out of something. That sub doing whatever it is doing isn't important, at all. They're entitled little shits who act exactly like the people they hate when met with any sort of push back.

       Yeah, you've recommended that YouTube video already... The fact you can recommend that video so much in one thread either says you've been mentally compromised in some fashion, or you're trying to get more YouTube views and likes..if so, recreate your profile and/or repost the video to give the sense that someone is censoring you some more..
