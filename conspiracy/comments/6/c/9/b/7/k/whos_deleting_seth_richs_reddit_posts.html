</blockquote>

<p>I say this as a former ops team member of a few very large well known companies and as politely as possible: you couldn&#39;t be more wrong that there is no way. Of course there is a way and careless or malicious ops engineers might do such things but a well run shop will a) have very well disciplined staff and b) have tools in place to raise alarms in case of a breach, among other mechanisms that would eliminate both the need and opportunity to do so. In early stages of product development though and in very rare instances, direct backend DB access might be necessary. But that&#39;s just me now being overly pedantic about running ops.</p>

<p>Whatever reddit has internally and how they massage posts and data isn&#39;t important. The fact is that they do, which means ALL of their data <em>and</em> metadata upto date are tainted and useless. Conde Nast has either vested interest in creating these shenanigans or is clueless about what is going on, in either case it&#39;s bad for ad business, but I guess the perceived public opinion manipulation pays better than targeted ads these days hence it continues. <em>I</em> <em>believe</em> it&#39;ll all lead to a fallout once a platform that offers a better (not a reboot of the same) experience appears on the market.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What events?  From what I saw he didn&#39;t talk about anything remotely related to the DNC or politics in that account.  He talked about his dog,cycling, Nebraska, and football, mostly.    Did some angry motorist shoot him for running a stop sign on his bike?  Did his bookie kill him for unpaid football bets?  A Sooners fan for him calling them an Okie?  Did his dog finally get pissed off about fetching sticks and pull a gun and say &quot;fetch this, bitch&quot;?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dude the events of his life, they don&#39;t have to be related to the conspiracy.  You would make a really bad investigator if you don&#39;t think tracking someone&#39;s whereabouts and what they did are not important. Its still very odd why some of him comments have been deleted last night or early this morning.</p>

Even if they did why would they delete posts not related to much of anything other than having an interesting timestamp/ip?</p>

<p>And lastly why are you called me a psycho, do you think that is appropriate?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They probably started deleting the posts one by one and then said fuck it, I&#39;ll just find anything personal or identifying and delete that.</p>

<p>My family doesn&#39;t know my reddit login, but if they got on my computer it would all be stored in my browser.  What posts had an interesting timestamp or ip?</p>

<p>Yes, I think it is quite appropriate to collectively call you people psycho.</p>
