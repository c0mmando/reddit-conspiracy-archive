       I am not a regular poster (at all), I prefer to lurk. However, as a very regular lurker of both subs, I think certain people's allegiance to their specific sub might be clouding some minds. Despite what you may think of the mods of T_D grandstanding or trying to create drama, they were being treated unfairly by Reddit as a whole. Any sub that contradicts the status quo will be targeted by this mass censorship. I'm very much afraid /Conspiracy is next.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't care if people in the My Little Pony sub started talking about the Deep State and Seth Rich to the extent these two have, the same response will be given. The two subs should band together to ensure that each remain a beacon of free speech and thought in a world of constant liberal and conservative propaganda.

       That's a horrible argrument. Everyone should be treated equally. Every sub should be equally treated. That's like placing certain restrictions on black people because "they're more prone to crime." That stuff doesn't work in the real world and you're just making excuses.

       I'm sure the individual supporters are fine in real life, but the narrative that the_d's small collective of prolific spammers portrays of liberal fascists, reverse racism, mobs of raping refugees and a seemingly insatiable appetite for gleefully scarfing up ripe steaming turds from this pathetic president is a bummer.

       Gosh I sure didn't mean to hurt your feelings.  How do you feel about President Trump following through with this 100 billion dollar weapons deal with the Saudis?  I know they're a strategic ally, but they've been implicated quite clearly in al qaeda financing and have a wretched human rights history.  I thought it was uncharacteristically soft for the president to have pulled a 180 on that relationship since his campaign rhetoric against Clinton was clearly admonishing her ties to that government.

       I think it's also notable that he bowed to the king and Melania chose not to cover her hair considering he admonished them for doing both of those things previously.
