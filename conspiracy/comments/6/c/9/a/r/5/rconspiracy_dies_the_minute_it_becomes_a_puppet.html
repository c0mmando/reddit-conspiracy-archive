    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Concern trolling&quot;? Are you for real? That could not have sounded more like an excuse if you tried. </p>

<p>For starters, so what? Meta posts about a subreddit has never hurt anyone. And this post was trying to ensure the longevity of this sub, so there were 0 problems there. </p>

<p>Second, so what if someone has never posted to the subreddit? People shouldn&#39;t fear that, every time they leave a comment/post, the mods are going to search their comment history. Lurkers exist, you know. </p>

<p>Third, this was clearly a popular opinion shared by many others. It got to the front page. So by removing it you&#39;re just reinforcing peoples&#39; ideas and theories that this sub is going to die if it&#39;s influenced by the stupidity of t_d. </p>

<p>Last, there were 0 reasons for this to be removed and you know it. &quot;Concern trolling&quot; is probably the most obvious and bullshit excuse I&#39;ve ever seen to remove or delete something. Concern is a real thing, you know. Concern means to be worried about the state (or future state) of something. How you even thought that putting together &quot;concern&quot; and &quot;trolling&quot; is a good idea is a mystery. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My first issue is why you&#39;d call constructive criticism trolling. It makes no sense, except hen you&#39;re in a community that does not accept any other views than the one enforced by the leaders or the majority.</p>

<p>And that is inherently something bad.</p>

<p>A post like this one, which highlights a potential issue in a community and proposes solutions can have an extremely positive effect on a community, as long as that community is willing and able to take into consideration.</p>

<p>Or this &quot;no concern trolling&quot; rule effectively prevents any such action, forcefully removing any attempts from the community to re-adjust itself or to keep itself in check.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This post is just a vague rant about Trump, it&#39;s far from constructive criticism. He doesn&#39;t even have any examples to back up the point he&#39;s trying to make. This post does not even come close to proposing solutions either, I have no idea where you got that idea from. Again, it&#39;s just a vague rant.</p>

<p>This is just textbook concern trolling. Trying to create a problem by complaining about something with nothing to prove that it&#39;s even a real issue and no proposed solution or steps to minimise the supposed issue.</p>

<p>This entire post could be condensed down to &quot;righties get out reeeeee&quot;</p>

<p>And even in these conditions, this post has reached a high score, enough for me to see it on <a href="/r/all/rising">/r/all/rising</a></p>

<p>So not sure how you could possibly think this post is &quot;creating a problem&quot;, unless you just don&#39;t like what it says and are trying to counteract it through this silly &quot;no concern trolling&quot; rule.</p>

Stuff like Russian numbers stations, the daycare center that everyone thought was secretly a government front, and more mainstream stuff like the influence of money on public policy and backroom deals in business and government, weren&#39;t uncommon to find.

<p>If Hillary killed Seth that means the whole Mainstream media has been lying in cahoots with the DNC..</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The media at large, not just mainstream, have never been trustworthy. They&#39;re in cahoots with no-one so much as they look out for their own interests and profit streams. They&#39;re in &quot;cahoots&quot; with whomever suits them.</p>

<p>Do not miss the bigger picture, in the era of globalisation you keep evolving and thinking in terms of America, the DNC, the GOP, CNN, WaPo, ... They are just pawns in a bigger game that goes back way before you country was a country.</p>

<p>The reason some on this sub push back so hard against T_D and other Trump supporters is that they openly take part in that bigger game and advocate for it.</p>

<p>I, speaking for myself, care little about Seth Rich. It&#39;s sad yes, whatever happened to him, but it&#39;s nothing compared to the thousands that die every year because of the game you take part in, it simply does not matter.</p>

<p>Support for Trump is support for a system that is directly responsible for millions of deaths, for the enslavement of countries, for the stifling of free humans and for exploitation of humanity. Same goes for support of Obama, Clinton, Macron, Le Pen, Theresa May, Merkel, ... </p>

<p>For a bunch that like to tout about how &quot;woke&quot; they are there is a distinct lack of awakening to the realities of our society at large. Donald J. Trump is just another step in the same direction, the direction that kills, rapes, plunders and aims to leave this planet and the majority living on it rotting away begging for means to survive in a world they were thrown into.</p>

<p>You want to take back control and have people held accountable? Start by realising it will not happen in anything that has the shape or form of our current society, it is build for it&#39;s own survival, it will not jeopardise itself.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Heh, sure. So it&#39;s clear, I don&#39;t disagree that this has happened, on the contrary it&#39;s par for the course for these people.</p>

<p>I mostly disagree with the fact that Trump and his administration will drain anything. Time will tell, but it&#39;s more than the &quot;swamp&quot; that needs draining. Clintons are just pawns, shut them down, someone else will take their place because the interest groups behind them will still be there.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You make me sad. Not because your comment. I could care less about that. I am sad that all you know is hate. Every comment you have posted is cussing one thing out or another. You say things to intentionally hurt people yet praise people who you will never meet and would never want to meet you or even associate themselves with somebody like you.</p>

<p>I am sorry that you were raised in a tough environment. I am sorry that you are fearful. I hope someday I can see a positive comment from you. When the only thing you enjoy is hating, then all you welcome into your life is fear. Fear that the people you bash will retaliate, fear that your daily reutine will be violated, fear that you can&#39;t trust others. The world is a tough place but that doesn&#39;t allow you to make it even tougher for others.</p>

<p>Everybody wants what they think is best. Everyone has intentions of protecting the ones they love. Everyone has a family. Everyone has something or someone they care about and love. When ever you type a hateful message, you aren&#39;t sending it to an empty abyss of your enemy. You are sending it to your neighbor who wants the best for their friends, family, and country.</p>

<p>Hope you feel better.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes both parties are corrupt. Both are controlled by their corporate overlords, but all hope is not lost. We can get out from under these 2 boots. The first step is to get the money out of politics, to cut the strings.  There is some progress towards this goal with <a href="http://www.wolf-pac.com/28th">the proposed 28th Amendment.</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>&quot;Corporations are not people. They have none of the Constitutional rights of human beings. Corporations are not allowed to give money to any politician, directly or indirectly. No politician can raise over $100 from any person or entity. All elections must be publicly financed.&quot;</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>If we&#39;re successful in leveling the playing field, then 3rd parties could finally have a chance to compete. It&#39;s the only path I see out of this terrible 2-party system.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree that r/politics should also allow posts that arent from journalists but I also want to point out that wikileaks behavior in the last election weeks showed a lot how they have changed since their first appearence. In the last weeks of the election I dont remember that wasnt written like a post from r/the_donald which I think is very sad because wikileaks was a major point in seeing all the shit the bush administration has done (and Clinton before it), but in the last months it became more or less a mix between RT news and r/the_donald.</p>

<p>wikileaks went from leaking the truth to leaking what is needed to fuck over the US/NATO/EU and to support russia. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I disagree with you completely.  Easing tension with Russia is a good thing.  Easing tension we have with any country is a good thing.  If Hillary had won Assange would be killed or in that embassy another 8 years.  Now he has an opportunity to get out.  Anyone that believes Denocrats didnt help corner Assange in that embassy is probably a bit delusional.  Obama had access to any info they want on any person in the United States &amp; the most damaging thing they released was the Billy Bush Access Hollywood video.  Why?  Because they couldnt find shit.  If they REALLY had concerns about taxes I am SURE the NSA couldve got them &amp; leaked them under the guise of hacking/leaking if there was anything there.  Additionally - i&#39;ve heard Trump didnt use email.  Maybe people around him but not himself.  This is suspicious but its also smart given the current state of affairs.  Keep in mind Hillary also signed off on Kim Dotcom&#39;s extradition request.  They pissed off a lot of smart techies over the last 8 years globally.  They dug their own grave as far as i am concerned.  All you have to do is what is in the best interest of the people instead of what is best for multinational corporations &amp; you can avoid these troubles.  You&#39;re on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> — dems/repubs are all considered corrupt here.  There are not good guys in this House of Cards or Game of Thrones.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I totally agree that neither Hillary nor the DNC is in any way innocent. They are corrupt as well, well all know that. I also agree that easining tension is overall a good think. No one should want tensions, but what I can see is that a lot of countrys surrounding russia (belarus, ukraine, baltics, kasachstan, mongolia etc.) are getting pressured by russia and drawn into conflicts. A lot of social media gets botted by russia and this is not a good thing. You just cant annex other countries (or parts of it) in todays time (I also agree that the american imperalism is the exact same shit).</p>

<p>There are huge struggles inside of most russian bordering countries because of the diplomacy of russia. Most of these countries are trying to &quot;move away&quot; from russia and to join western organisation like the EU /UN/NATO. The reason why they want that is that they know the russians better then we do. They where there puppets for decades and dont want to be enslaved by them another time and they see what the EU and western organisation can actually bring them. Money, education, better infastructure, better trade etc. russia cant offer anything of these things. They are struggeling on their own and a major move to keep their own people under their belt is to create conflicts to keep them happy. 
I would love to lose the tensions with russia but only if russia does stop pushing their bots and soldiers into these countries. </p>

<p>I think you give trump to much credit for beeing a &quot;smart&quot; person. He clearly isnt (or not anymore. I think he actually has a mental problem . It would explain a lot what he says). I smell a big conflict around trumps own advisors. You have a lot of different groups (his family, the GOP, the billionaires, and &quot;altright&quot;) and all of them try to get their shere of trump which leads to conflict inside the government.</p>

<p>In the end it doesnt really matter atm because time will go on and soon we will see how all of this will turn out. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My sister during the election said something like this when i was going on anti-Hillary rants on social media - she came to my defense b/c i was getting attacked by so called family &amp; friends - &quot;Trump&#39;s flaws are easy to identify &amp; can fit easily in a sound bite while Hillary&#39;s are much harder to unravel &amp; require extensive research &amp; attention to detail.&quot;  My point - Russia&#39;s flaws vs. US flaws are the same w/ Russia being Trump(no pun intended😘) &amp; Hillary representing the US.  Russia invades countries but so does the US.  But in addition to invading countries via military force the US also does it economically via the World Bank &amp; many other shitty organizations it controls.  The US is the biggest creator of global friction &amp; anything the other superpowers are guilty of pales in comparison.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why cant we allow all types of conspiracies? A lot of people are genuinely interested in the murder of Seth Rich. Just because the_donald politicized it doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s not an actual conspiracy. A lot of people believe in this conspiracy and not all of them are pushing it because of political reasons. I&#39;m fine with people posting Trump conspiracies. I just don&#39;t like being called a shill every time I express my opinion. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>People disagree, ge over it.  Osme people think Trump is a outsider actually trying to drain the swamp.  Others think hes a bad guy cause he might pollute America, while ignoring that he killed TPP.  Like you, they ignore things he actually did and harp on things that he hasnt done but they think he will.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Heh, sure. So it&#39;s clear, I don&#39;t disagree that this has happened, on the contrary it&#39;s par for the course for these people.</p>

<p>I mostly disagree with the fact that Trump and his administration will drain anything. Time will tell, but it&#39;s more than the &quot;swamp&quot; that needs draining. Clintons are just pawns, shut them down, someone else will take their place because the interest groups behind them will still be there.</p>
