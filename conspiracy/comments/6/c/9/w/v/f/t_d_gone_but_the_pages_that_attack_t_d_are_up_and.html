       I would assume people here are noticing this, but if you go to ALL, everyday there is at least 1-3 top posts from pages that attack T_D or try to discredit it. Yet when i go to any of those subs, their subscribers are very little and somehow the likes on those front pages gets over 15k. Anyone with a brain can see it is voter manipulation. Yet when i go to T_D all of their front page are usually 10k+ for the first page.
      </p>
      <p>
       I dont like Trump, infact i can care less for him, but the censorship reddit is going towards to in the past few years is quite Digg like. Too many shills and inflated likes are taking over.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Conspiracy is.. reddit was looking to make T_D implode and so they found a way to do it. Also it makes reddit bottom line fatter. Over the past few months, there has been articles and videos on how mods are able to sell their souls to sway the narrative. I would imagine reddit's board are doing the same.
      </p>
      <p>
       By imploding i mean push T_D to go against the terms and condition reddit has for its users.

       They added a subreddit filter feature specifically for all the people butthurt about seeing posts about the_donald
      </p>
      <p>
       If it was such an issue you would just filter it out. Meanwhile reddit is ACTUALLY being spammed by anti-donald subreddits, nobody seems bothered by that though.

       It's the snarky comments like this "buh bye" etc that fuel them. It's the same reason everyone flipped their shit and all these bot filled anti-trump subs appeared. Yes lots of people hate Trump, yes, T_D has made a semi-parody God like figure of him, we get it.

       Why do people act like that sub got to the top through manipulation, they got the traffic organically and they won their election, amazing how filtering their sub still didn't affect their reality of winning. almost like your viewpoint is completely irrelevant, it is.  And yet you still would cheer causes of censorship, seriously kys for supporting censorship.

       Ignoranamous, they had been surpressing the algorithm for months, basically removing it from the front page, and they artifically shill anti-Trunp subs to the top with no organic interest.  It's censorship when they vioate their own sites terms and agreements and general philosophy.  No principle having people like couldn't understand, even if you do subscribe to this sub for whatever reason.

       That is such a dumb post. Also, I love how any argument against T_D always just boils down to "I don't like how they use stickies".
      </p>
      <p>
       For a start their evidence is that r/the_Donald doesn't appear on r/all. Instead of jumping to the logical conclusion that the algorithm created to keep them off r/all was successful in keeping them off r/all they made up some vague theory about stickies.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's​ really nothing to substantiate the claim that they're abusing stickies either. Even the OP concedes that they're just carrying on exactly how they did before.

       It wasn't their spam that got them restricted, it was the vote manipulation, doxxing, and bridgading. Other anti-trump subs got similar strict rules at T_D, but they actually followed said rules. T_D went rouge a few days ago and started blatantly breaking the site rules. Then the mods decided to play the drama card and go private. I hear their voat move is a solid 3k people.

       Well you must've stumbled across 1 out of 10 (or however many) mods who was having a bad day then. I've seen countless amounts of debates within T_D, where the users acted maturely and professionally and the mods didn't delete anything or ban anyone.

       Sounds like every other subs policy. I've seen this tactic in many subs besides The Donald. I've seen people banned just because they were subbed to here or The Donald or some other sub the mods don't agree with which IMO is fine and fair. They clearly just want to hear one side so stick with the one side of you're in that sub. How echo chambers and safe spaces work. It's like that on twitter and FB so I don't see you're argument here. You want to open discuss your ideas I think Conspiracy is a place you can do that if imaginary internet points don't bother you because this sub is brigaded by the elite everyday. People still see sides when there isn't. It's rulers and the power hungry who smell their moms soul vs the people they want to control

       I can only speak for my experience in which I was banned because the mods looked through my post history and found anti-trump posts on other subs. This was after I, a Hoosier, explained the truth about trumps carrier deal that they apparently did not want to hear.

       That's not what I'm doing at all. I'm making fun of them for routinely mocking safe spaces while being one of the most ban-happy subs. No where do I ever claim they're the only sub to do it, just making fun of another example of their clear hypocrisy. I only need one more scandal for a bingo!

       You can go to
       <a href="/r/soccer">
        /r/soccer
       </a>
       and complain that players in certain leagues take too many dives though, or that FIFA is a plague on the sport, or even propose rule changes if you want. In short, you can freely criticize aspects of the sport. There was no point when you could go to t_d and say, for example, that you support the admin but his arms sales to the Saudis are a mistake and maybe the community should put pressure on him not to do that.

       T_D literally bans pro-Trump posters for the slightest criticism.  Even something as mild as saying they don't like the 30% price hike AHCA added for being too close to the individual mandate is a bannable offense from a poster with a long history of being pro-Trump.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can act like T_D is just removing people who talk shit, but that's a blatant lie.  They ban anyone who says the slightest thing critical of anything Trump has done, no matter how heinous or how much contemporary evidence there is of him or his administration doing it.  I have been downvoted for critiquing Hillary in pro-Hillary subs, but I've never been banned for it, and I literally called her an evil wizard in one of my top posts of all time.
      </p>
      <p>
       Meanwhile I could say "boy you know I like Trump a lot but I feel like Betsy Devos wasn't the best choice for secretary of education MAGA" and be banned for it on T_D.  That statement is a bannable offense on T_D despite being possibly the mildest criticism possible for this administration.  I seriously question whether someone has been banned from T_D for stating they prefer their steak without ketchup.  That too falls under the extremely vague guidelines of "concern trolling" being a bannable offense.

       They fight for free speech outside of reddit,  where it's currently being attacked viciously by the media and universities. The Donald was set up by rule to be a pro Donald sub,  and people going to troll were booted,  just like they are in other subs.   Reddit staff have been upping their game of manipulation and bullshit for years but many seem fine with that as long as its not against their side of the political fence.   This world has too few places without blatant manipulation and corruption, and it has lost one good one in reddit.  It's a damn shame.

       UC Berkeley literally invited pro-Trump speakers, it's not anti-Trump and hasn't limited free speech.  The
       <em>
        students
       </em>
       were evidently unhappy with those speakers but their actions weren't sanctioned by the university and if it responds to its students making trouble that's an extremely different problem.   Yale is what I had in mind which has publicly announced some anti-Trump sentiments but also happens to be a private university.  If you have a public university that has actually officially announced being against Trump, I'd like to know.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not "worried about T_D banning a few trolls," I'm just pointing ought that A) they don't only ban trolls and B) it's hypocritical to claim you are trying to preserve free speech when you can't even organize a forum without censoring relevant discussion engaged in good faith.

       What freedoms?  Guns?  The right isn't doing shit to preserve gun rights, with all the shit they have forced through for their agenda gun legislation is mired in committee.  Every other freedom at risk is at risk because the right is stealing them away from people and selling them to corporations.  You can claim it "pisses off the right" and "the left loves it" but the only people and the only politicians I've seen speak against the right killing net neutrality and appointing some of the least qualified possible cabinet members has been on the left except for a brief period of time before the_Donald banned everyone who dared "concern trolled" by stating they weren't happy about that.
      </p>
      <p>
       So... support your BS.  What freedoms are disappearing and what is the right doing to protect them?  Because as far as I have seen the right is against far more freedoms than the left is.

       It's way more severe than that. T_D didn't allow any criticism of Trump or his policies. I watched a few threads right dryer the Syria strike and everyone was confused, because up until that time they were opposed to intervention. People who questioned whether it was a good idea were banned, even if they were reasonable and had a lot of community support.
      </p>

       I mean, T_D can do whatever they want, but they are into extreme censorship.

       They had an ass ton of mods. Some were heavy banners. I was banned twice. I submitted for reinstatement and was welcomed back. You can't vet all those mods. As for the Syria strike, I didn't see many bans in that time, I don't really see bans. I know they exist and I know they are frivolous because of how easily I was banned and how easy it was to get back.  Disinformation is real. T_D really was a force that needed subversion from the opposing side. It was bound to happen.

       I had a thread questioning the strike that survived. While I absolutely think they were a bit over sensitive (some of the mods, anyways) they typically only banned those who weren't there in good faith.

      <p>
       As I've said, their bar was higher and I won't dispute that. I'm just not sure if I blame them. It's clear how Reddit, as a whole, view Trump supporters. If you let that attitude run rampant you just become the next ETS and that's not what they were there for.

       I don't know about net neutrality.  Haven't been to T_D in a few days.
      </p>
      <p>
       I never claimed they didn't delete comments and such. In fact I said some mods were over sensitive. Your experience backs up the very thing I claimed. Still there's no evidence the mods deleted the comments (though they likely did). It is possible for you to delete your own.
      </p>
      <p>
       Only claimed it's not nearly as bad as everyone makes it out be. If everyone were to be believed, Reddit is the true bastion​ of free speech and T_D is North Korea. Reality, and my experiences there, do not bear that out.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again -- that doesn't mean they were perfect. Far from it. They were heavy handed at times. Some mods were absolutely over sensitive. I'm just not sure yet if I blame them.
      </p>
      <p>
       The comments in this thread, and on conspiracy over the past few hours, show how Reddit users view Trump and his supporters. Was T_D supposed to let comments like that take over their sub?
      </p>
      <p>

       That's entirely separate from not allowing dissent.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example, politics only bans for name calling, foul language, shill accusations. Just about every major politics post has a slew of pro-Trump shitposts at the bottom and some more reasoned conservative comments elsewhere. I will point out that many reasonable conservatives have a hard time with Trump

       It's not different. A lot of subs don't allow dissent when their purpose is to be pro-something. Politics is not supposed to be pro-something (though, in practice, they are).

       I'm not saying T_D was right, or I agree with most of it. Only that you and many others are way overstating things.

       And how other people feel about Trump is totally irrelevant when discussing a forum dedicated to being Pro-Trump.

       The user base of politics is liberal, but they don't delete comments or ban users for dissenting viewpoints. As for how severe the banhammer and comment censorship was at T_D, we're using subjective terminology anyhow.

       I watched it happen in real time in one of the front page threads on the strikes. Any comment questioning whether the strikes were the right move was deleted. By the end it was a massive comment graveyard and the comments left were all expressing support for the strikes and sending a message and thank god we don't have that weakling Obama anymore.

       Because it is a fallacious argument lacking of merit.  the_D makes it very clear in its rules that it is not a place for debate, but rather serves the purpose of venerating a single candidate.  There is no intention prescribed or assumed that it is place for vigorous debate, unlike an open ended sub dedicated to the DEBATE of politics. Let me enlighten you to the dynamic of the "safe Space" you seem to have lost site of.  No on gives a care if you choose to find your solitude in a closed community of like minded people. In fact it is the American way. Case in point, ethnic churches, neighborhoods, and clubs of all sorts, where people given the choice, choose to self segregate. No that is not the complaint at all, but rather when ones idea of a "Safe Space" Leeches into the domain of public discourse that is where  the problem lies

       Simply put the OP made a false argument of equivalence, and a simple observation of post histories illustrates it is not out of ignorance but rather an agenda clearly shown through the behavior of cataloging screen shots from a random page of a then shuttered Sub.

       That's a convinient excuse for the heavy censorship they do.

       Not an excuse, rather an overlooked reality. 
And they don't call themselves the last bastion of free speech, you do. I m guessing because you recognize the limitations place on the speech of Trump supporters elsewhere. Of course you would never admit it but your perception as such betrays your viewpoint.

       Which of my posts, in this sub, which are being downvoted by TD posters (they are nice enough to send private messages) are at a 5th grade level.
      </p>
      <p>
       Neat fact, the average reading level of the private messages I have received is between 3rd and 4th grade depending on which formula you use.
      </p>
      <p>
       This won't drive me away btw, engaging me in discussion is better.  However most on TD aren't capable of that since they appear to be scared of those who would take them out of their snowflake encrusted safe-spaces.

       It's clear you have something against Trump and T_D. They didn't always ban everyone who wasn't "loyal" (your words, not mine). It got out of hand. So they made AskThe_Donald where people could debate about Trump. T_D became a place for just supporters.
      </p>
      <p>
       They didn't​actually silence anything, they just asked you do it in the appropriate subreddit. Not something I like, personally, but also not at all what you're claiming.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also your claim is hyperbolic. It's obvious you've never interacted with T_D and are just regurgitating what you've read on Reddit. I've​ been critical of Trump numerous times on T_D. I was never banned.
      </p>
      <p>
       They only banned trolls and those who were clearly not there in good faith. Kind of like every other subreddit. Their bar was maybe higher, I'll give you that. Not sure if blame them given the contempt many here feel towards Trump and his supporters.

       Ask the Donald is just as bad! Non-Trump supporters get banned for not asking a question! It's not debate, it's more regulated ban-space for Donald supporters to pretend like they're rational.

       It seemed to me that the status quo had been shifting. The bots that autoposted tweets and headlines dominated the content and user activity was down. People have become distracted and confused and the "T_D show" was getting more challenging to maintain. I theorized earlier in the week that Kushner ran the sub and change was in the air.

       You come up with an ultimatum to build-up to the event, stage a showdown and ride off into the sunset. The admins might even have been in on it. When it went private I knew that was it; T_D isn't coming back.

       CTR/Shareblue was horrendous during the election and still is. The politics sub, for instance, is just one of the subs that has been completely destroyed and is a complete waste of time unless you're a Hillbot.

       Killary makes the headline herself too, oh wait... She doesn't, does she. Since she and her political gang of mobsters are colluding very closely with the press and has turned the MSM into a Clinton and establishment Dem propaganda machine, covering up nicely for the psychopath in a pant suit, as shown by emails published by Wikileaks.

       The other option is that the mods are controlled. We all know Trump was not supposed to win the election. The same people working for the DNC, who bought up the mods on almost every other political sub on reddit, certainly would have tried to buy TD mods with plans to shut the sub down afterward, to quell criticism of the newly elected Clinton (they did the same with Sanders subs when it became clear they successfully stole the nomination). But oh no, Trump won! Controlled opposition became the sub of the
       <em>
        President
       </em>
       . What to do? Same mods. Then stuff comes out damaging the DNC and they strangely go private for no reason. Makes you wonder.

       Stop acting like you are talking on behalf of everyone on reddit. YOU hated the sub, YOU are ONE SINGLE PERSON and you do NOT speak for me. If you absolutely must talk about "people", clarify that they are mostly ShareBlue cubicle workers or die hard Hillary supprters who are more than happy to silence anyone who dares say something negative about their failed queen or promotes another politician than her.

       As a Bernie supporter I can handle that other people do not agree with me. I can handle that T_D people don't like Sanders. It's their right to dislike him, even hate him, just like it is my right to dislike both Trump and HRC. What I refuse to handle, are bigots and hypocrites who do everything they can to stifle free exchange of ideas by pushing for orwellian censorship in order to silence other people. That kind of shite does not belong in a democracy. That is promoting a fucking FASCIST TYRANNY. Maybe you should move to North Korea, sounds like your kind of place.

       You have zero basis for saying that "most of reddit" hated T-D.
Again, why is it that you can not master the very simple task of speaking only for yourself? Are you some kind of self proclaimed psychic who think you can see straight into other people's minds? Or do you use Tarot cards to determine how many people are in favor of orwellian censorship?
      </p>
      <p>
       Back up your claim with FACTS and NUMBERS that clearly shows that "most of reddit" hated T-D, or shut up with your whining.

       Your personal opinion is not a fact. And are you now also going completely off the deep end, claming that you have visited every single sub on reddit to see if there are actually more people than just me who are opposed to the kind of censorship you seem to love so very, very much?

       I am happy to see you confirm that you do not have the slightest clue what you are talking about. Now I can simply dismiss you as ignorant, thanks and bye.

       The funny thing is that if you post something positive about Trump anywhere on reddit except for the t_d, you almost assuredly have to preface it with "I don't like Trump, but...." or else the downvotes and doxxers come out in force.

       That's because people don't like Trump and downvote posts that are pro-Trump, especially when they are pro-Trump in a post discussing new, bad legislation his administration is passing.  As for doxxing... I'm sure it's happened a couple times but still haven't seen any evidence of anyone other than T_D doing that.

       The top mod of t_d got doxxed yesterday. They found out her kids, place of employment and where she lives. They also said they called her employer multiple times.

       Remember when reddit censored the_donald's stickies because they were getting too many upvotes? if it gets too many they invent a new rule, just for your subreddit and nobody else's.
      </p>
      <p>
       So now anything deemed important enough to be stickied is no longer visible by the rest of the site, seems fair right?

       There's a substantial difference.
      </p>
      <p>
       If one is abusing a flaw in the system, the system is at fault for letting it happen simply because
       <em>
        anyone else could've done it
       </em>
       . T_D was just the first one to discover and abuse it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Relevant example: hackers who find vulnerabilities (generally) are given prizes, not punished for it.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the system changes to target someone, it's clear discrimination.

       Or ya know, something like a "free mint" at the hostess desk, everyone else had common courtesy to take one or two.

       T_d on the other had grabs hand fulls.  When they're asked to just take a couple like everyone else, they scream "why are you oppressing me 😭!!", steals the full bowl, and then complains when they're not allowed back at the restaurant.

       <a href="/r/all">
        /r/all

       are probably deliberately allowed (i.e. manually flipping a switch) in order to allow themselves to look as immature as possible ("FUCK CNN FUCK CNN...") or to back up the Deep State narrative (when Trump went with the DHS report saying Assad did the Syria attack).

       Historically, specifically complaining about downvotes will result in downvotes. Kind of like answering someone with a "Let Me Google that For You" will result in down votes, which I personally feel is unfair.

       There are quite a few subs that auto-ban you if you even make a single comment on subs they don't like. Such as T_D and theredpill.
      </p>
      <p>
       This has been known for a long time now.

       I lurked to see the other side of "the news". Latestage cap and two x were the most recent ones banning people for posting in TD. Hillary Clinton's tiny sub banned most everyone. Before the election people were posting screen grabs of being banned by 2 or 3 other subs while claiming they've never been in them. I believe most people went out and earned those bans though.
      </p>
      <p>
       Share Blue or CTR made a CSS script that flagged people outside of TD for downvotes.

       OP was talking about Trump supporters being banned on
       <a href="/r/news">
        /r/news
       </a>
       (which is supposed to be neutral at least in terms of what is allowed on it). I was questioning people being banned on
       <a href="/r/news">
        /r/news
       </a>
       simply for being trump supporters.  I wont deny that there are subs that ban simply for posting on others but those don't pretend to be neutral.

       Same goes for people on T_D. Someone makes a post along the lines of "How do all you traitors sleep at night while supporting a Russian puppet!?", then they get banned, then they go to one of 50 subreddits to rant about how they got banned for just "asking a question".
      </p>
      <p>
       It's like there are cunts on both sides.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, I will say I have been banned from subs like me_irl just for posting on T_D. They have a bot that bans you automatically​ if you post anywhere that does wrongthink.

       Forreal. I made a post about the F35 on r/credibledefense and one of the top comments was along the lines of "this person has posted on r/the_donald so don't listen to him and he's also probably a Russian operative".

       We had a mod suspended here by the admins weeks ago for some petty bullshit.

       Did you see us shut the place down and throw a tantrum?

       No.

       We took it for what it was, continued on short handed and then decided to add more (because if they just remove us we need users ready to jump in).

       You all keep saying that but I've seen absolutely no evidence of what you, and many others, are accusing them of doing here. And I browse here every single day.
      </p>
      <p>
       There have been more pro-Trump conspiracies for sure. But is that really that bad? Are we now mad over the conspiracies we see? Are the only valid conspiracies the ones that validate our world view?
      </p>
      <p>
       I've seen no all caps posts. I've seen almost no calling of cucks (maybe a stray comment or two). I've seen none of the "racism et Al" everybody loves to accuse them of. The most I've seen is people defending T_D from accusations like this.
      </p>
      <p>
       This just reads like you're trying to feed the fear of T_D so they aren't welcome anywhere on Reddit.

       Nah, man. Read again. I was implying that if r/conspiracy do not stop talking about Seth Rich, Weiner,  etc the sub is going to go the same way as T_D. This was blatant censorship, do you think now that they were succesful shutting down T_D they are going to stop doing it, this sub is next. Because they obviously are suppresing these types of news.

       I have mixed feelings in t_d. One the one hand I don't think it is ok to censor info and opinions you don't agree with, even if they are wrong and ignore reality. On the other hand there has been no worse mod abuse censorship sub the the Donald. The mods banned any content or comments that even remotely challenged trumps narrative and or wanted to hold him accountable. At the end of the day you reap what you so. The Donald turned into a troll sub that was constantly on the front page but no regular users could comment on that's not right. What Reddit did was apsolutly wrong but you cannot blame them for trying to rein the politicals dubs in. Basically Reddit was wrong but t-d was daring them to do something.

       That would be your first option: our society is completely insane. Those running it are the craziest, with only a handful of exceptions. Our society is self-destructive and suicidal, and is cheerfully cutting out its own heart so that it can eat it.

       It's propaganda. they should ban users for encouraging violence, not massive subreddits. Although I assume leftists would argue that supporting trump
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       an act of violence in itself.

       Reddit admins can't just go around and ban the subreddit of the President of the United States. The few good core mods have been forcefully removed and the entire sub will be back up &amp; running, this time under "new" (i.e. accounts that are really the admins or their buddies) leadership, so they can say "see?! we didn't censor anyone!"

       I remember reading a while ago that the admins would manually move ownership of large subs in the event that a rogue mod does something like this.  Why won't they do that now? Why didn't they do that when CTR shut down the Sanders sub? It's because they don't want views that oppose the DNC agenda that the admins share to have large places to meet.

       Because this wasn't some rogue mod doing shit. It was the Donald community collectively being self destructive.

       People like you(assuming you support the donald and honestly that's the only context in which your comment makes any sense) would cry SO MUCH if the admins blocked Trumps community from doing something they collectively wanted.

       How come DNC supporters always assume those who don't like the DNC support Trump? From what I've seen, the mods do attempt to enforce rules mostly but a handful of mods chose to break rules. That should mean the mods are removed and the community stays. Since it goes against DNC ideology and this site has increasingly enjoys squashing dissenting opinions, the sub gets targeted as a whole.

       I saw a few post on T_D were users were doxxed simply because of posts they made. It would be somewhat easy to find out information depending on people user names or if they posted in local subreddits or had identifying pictures.

      <p>
       Some claimed they messaged the admins yet none response was given.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is so much hate for T_D, but they were essentially forced to make their own subreddit. On top of that the algorithm was been tweaked so many times to prevent it from reaching
       <a href="/r/all">
        /r/all

       . Not to mention Spez had admitted to editing pro-Trump comments at times.

       Its a vicious circle. The fact that they got differential treatment simply antogized everyone.

       I mean no disrespect, but that's your opinion. Many people on T_D see it differently. The frustration from T_D came from the fact that specific rules were imposed on them.

       Again your opinion... I've never seen anything racist on T_D. Wanting the government to enforce immigration laws isn't racist. Additionally criticism of Islam also isn't racist. Islam isn't a race.

       Now come on that's just nonsense. You obviously don't know what your saying or flat out lying. TD may have been antiglobalization but in the 9 months I was there I never seen any racism. It's 80% silly memes and 20% news. To say other wise is blatant hate for a sub you don't like.

       T_D clowns thought this shit was a democracy where they can have their way if the numbers were strong enough. It's not a democracy. It's a private business. You keep shitting on the owner of the business, you're gonna have a bad time. You keep antagonizing the other patrons of said business and silencing them in your section of the store, the owners are gonna tell you to fuck off.

       The first thing ("upvote this for x") you posted asks for upvotes specifically which is against site rules and I've never seen that on TD.  The "they think we can't make it to /all" posts I agree are annoying, and I'm against, but i think it's a gray area as it doesn't specifically call for votes. And I think that happens much less than the "Hello /all" or "/all this is what our president looks like" posts  what you might be thinking of, and I don't think is against the rules. For what it's worth I wish those posts would go away

       The other post about this in r/Conspiracy is full of Reddit/liberal/democratic shills saying it's no big deal.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's hypocritical, and a lot of anti-T_D posts have been as malicious as some of the trash coming from T_D. Hate breeds more hate, I guess, but it's shameful and everyone is acting like a bunch of babies.

       And what's weird is in between the one that makes it to the front page a day on each of these subs are hundreds of posts that don't break 100 upvotes. Even on the front page posts (besides the 123k one) the comment section is a graveyard. There will be 400 comments on a post with 6k likes and the highest upvoted comment is sitting at 250.

       Ultimately, this political divide will be what ruined reddit.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's fine to have s4p and The_Donald and even shilled-out politics, but once you let it bleed into EVERY other subreddit, from sports to video games to hobbies, it ruins the entire site.
      </p>
      <p>
       Reddit admins should realize that there is a huge majority of people who like to do things like watch movies and sports with zero political appeal. ESPN's downtrend is fair evidence of that, as they've over-politicized lately too.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some people just want to be entertained, enjoy their vices, and not care about the scum that run the nation. If they can't have that in a sub where they once just enjoyed cat pics, then it is eventually game over for the site.

       In some ways its good-it forces "normies" to recognize that they should care about politics, it effects everyone. Too many people don't vote cause they dgaf. And politics is part of human existence. Its about who has the power over others. You can't escape it, you must confront it and all of its evils/hypocrisies because these are human evils/hypocrisies.

       This is how I see it. Either the mods of T_D sold out and shut down the sub, or they were successfully triggered and baited into acting like idiots and then "protested" by shutting down the sub.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yep there a absolutely a double standard as anti-Trump subs get away with Reddit TOS violations every day while T_D has special rules only it must obey. But capitulation is not the answer. Now T_D is gone and at least half a dozen NEW anti Trump spam subs are all over
       <a href="/r/all">
        /r/all
       </a>
       , bringing the total up to god only knows how many.
      </p>
      <p>
       As a T_D subscriber it sure as hell looks like we lost this battle, thanks to mods who finally caved in to the relentless triggering from astroturfers. For shame. The special rules applied to T_D never bothered me, if they have to impose multiple handicaps on us in order to stand a fighting chance then so be it. I took it as a compliment. But now T_D is gone, if they bring it back who knows if it'll ever regain its momentum.

       When will you free speech goons get it through your head that a concerned focus of attention on something that's doing demonstrable harm is not the same as the issue that is being attacked. Hating nazis doesn't make you a nazi. Wanting to rid your body of an infection is not your body attacking the infections free speech.

       This has to go down in history as a case of the largest group of sore losers ever. They have taken it to a new level never seen before by modern man. They just can't let it go and get on with life. Just wait 4 years to get rid of the idiot. We had to wait 8 years with Bush.

       Killary makes the headline herself too, oh wait... She doesn't, does she. Since she and her political gang of mobsters are colluding very closely with the press and has turned the MSM into a Clinton and establishment Dem propaganda machine, covering up nicely for the psychopath in a pant suit, as shown by emails published by Wikileaks.

       You have zero basis for saying that "most of reddit" hated T-D.
Again, why is it that you can not master the very simple task of speaking only for yourself? Are you some kind of self proclaimed psychic who think you can see straight into other people's minds? Or do you use Tarot cards to determine how many people are in favor of orwellian censorship?
      </p>
      <p>
       Back up your claim with FACTS and NUMBERS that clearly shows that "most of reddit" hated T-D, or shut up with your whining.

       I saw a few post on T_D were users were doxxed simply because of posts they made. It would be somewhat easy to find out information depending on people user names or if they posted in local subreddits or had identifying pictures.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some claimed they messaged the admins yet none response was given.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is so much hate for T_D, but they were essentially forced to make their own subreddit. On top of that the algorithm was been tweaked so many times to prevent it from reaching
       <a href="/r/all">
        /r/all
