        Addressing lawmakers in Parliament who only a day earlier had been under lockdown, Mrs. May said on Thursday morning that the attacker was “a peripheral figure” who had been examined by MI5, Britain’s domestic counterintelligence agency, but who had not been “part of the current intelligence picture.”

       Mass surveillance does not work because it throws up too many false positives to handle, and that actively harms our security by diverting resources away from effective counter-terrorism.

       It only catches the dumb ones. It doesn't catch the smarter ones..and it would catch more dumb ones if the community that these terrorists live amongst would actually contact authorities. Maybe it's a disbelief because they don't really believe that their neighbor or child would do something like this. However, if people are unwilling to seek within themselves to know themselves then that person would be unaware of what others can possibly think. Ignorance of ignorance is the root cause and the only solution is to make a conscious choice to better understand ourselves. This requires experience and observation  of emotions and thoughts. This is what we must restore. But as of right now we have ADHD on the rise, Autism on the rise, and we all flock to our screens like moths do with porchlights.

       Rule no. 3 for Suicide Bombers and Jihadists:
      </p>
      <p>
       Always make yourself known to the security services of the country where you operate. It is bad form to conceal your identity beliefs or attitudes from the security services. You should on the other hand share as much information with them as you can.
      </p>
      <p>
       Make sure you travel to the middle east.
      </p>
      <p>
       Make sure you have Jihadi videos and literature in your home
      </p>
      <p>
       Hide any connections you might have to your cia or mossad handlers.
