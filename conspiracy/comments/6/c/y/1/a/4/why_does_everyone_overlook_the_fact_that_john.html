       Pretty slow but my reading comprehension is decent. It did not seem like he was just venting..
      </p>
      <p>
       But since no reporter has asked him to explain any of his emails, even the code words he used, I guess we will have to keep on speculating.

       too much other evidence for pizzagate - there was the time that alefantis called a guy and threatened his life and families and knew that "they" were taking down a bunch of youtube videos - then there was the guy who found CP on the actual server for cometpingpong, not to mention Majestic Apes "You're downstairs from subway - i hear jerry comes here often" Implying pedophilia and laughing "we all have our preferences" and a weird laugh - lots of known pedophile symbols all around that place - and the hacker who got into the website which was encrypted and you needed passwords to download it - reported it to the police and was then harrassed with his car n shit broken - not to mention podesta's friendship with Frued - who raped and groomed girls as young as 10 - who shared a work room with Cyril Smith who is now known to have over a 100 child victims - who was repeatedly arrested and let go because of the power of the queen and her satanic army... Did i mention a 3 year old went missing when john and podesta were in portugal at Frueds Vista? where the PARENTS went afterwards... I reread the email though - not as damning as i thought - still shows he's willing to make an example of a leaker - even though he's refering to firing them or yelling at them in this case - but that's for leaking to the press for limelight - if you leaked the entire DNC email thing - i'm sure you'd have quite a bit of heat coming down on you - lets not forget Assange pretty much has confirmed this for us - that seth was the leaker...

       I like how you pivoted from one thing and went off on a tangent.
      </p>
      <p>
       See.. this is why answering questions is a no-win situation. You said "explain the [alleged] code words." I stated it won't matter what he says unless it was "i rape boys," then you perfectly prove my point by going off on a tangent about 15 other things and totally ignore your first request about code words.
      </p>
      <p>
       That is why people don't necessarily take questions about a witch hunt. No win situation. "Prove to me you don't beat your wife"

       I just saw this comment and decided to provide an argument to it - as for the code words in the emails - it's really bizarre for someone to say "hey I have your black with white handkerchief" then it gets forwarded to someone saying "I have your handkerchief that has a map that's pizza related with on it" - i don't see how she can - without seeing the handkerchief - go from saying it's black w/ white to it having a pizza related map on it - you know this because she says the realtor can mail it to them still -

       Not what i'm saying - there's plenty of other evidence for that - I'm just saying that the handkerchief code is known, and that a MAP is a minor attracted person, and pizza is child porn, literally, you go into dark web sites and they say they want a cheese pizza baked for 10 minutes 15 minutes 9 minutes - these are all ages - then you go to abromovic who's twitter handle was 666 before it was changed - i wonder why - not like she cuts pentagrams into her body - or has studied the occult her whole life and many different spiritual practices - and pours blood everywhere and paints with it on walls and eats human cakes... right... nothing to see here... oh wait john did this personally with her? omg at her appartment? oh wow that's soooo cooooool. Not like Crowley said a blue eyed white boy was the best sacrifice and to draw a circle to collect the blood and energy to harvest, not at all, nope nothing to see here folks.

       Occult is a distraction because its not child porn and, if you know how to read, I said there is no evidence for pedo or CP and that occult is not cool, which is not the same as showing no evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regardless, I continue to state that the notion that "occult" is evidence of CP is ridiculous, as you know.

       You said you were well versed, i took that to mean that you comprehended the nature of the satanic pedophilic networks involving the elite, am I right or wrong here? I also reviewed my statements and find no need to change anything - i thought i did - but recant my statements - pretty amazing how easily your mind sways if you believe in the most subtle thought that your mind finds uncomfortable - pretty amazing - it moves worlds - literally

       Here's an email for John Podesta that's hard not to interpret murder or making someone disappear, especially in context... talking about a republican trying to pay to hide having sex eith young boys. Sounds to me like Podesta knows the meaning of that sentence well enough for it to be written to him, and that they are unhappy Dennis Hastert is making their paedophiliv activities public with his stunt.

       I don't get that can you explain that clearer, how can you make an example of someone who doesn't work for you? Just by not hiring them? How would they know? How would that make an example? Seems like they'd have to be established first, then be made an example of, see what i'm saying?

       Not hiring him and cutting him off from the campaign.   That is all he was planning on doing.    Approximately sixteen orders of magnitude away from murder.  The person would know he was being made an example of because he was not hired.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hiring someone just so you could make an example of them is something a psychopath would do.  John Podesta is not psychopath.  The worst thing he could come up with doing to someone was not hiring them.

       He is a psychopath, but asides that, they already HAD a leaker, so they couldn't not hiring someone they already hired... or wait, i think i see what you're saying, that someone affiliated with the campaign but not hired leaked something and that they didn't hiring them as an example, gotcha, totally get that now. Yes i agree that the email has nothing to do with murder, that's why i had an edit, do i think they murdered him though? Hell yes.

       They leaked the fact that Hillary was starting up a campaign, and hiring marketing people to rebrand her.   She had not announced yet.    They probably told people being interviewed to keep it quiet, but maybe didn't go so far as to make them sign an NDA.   Being cut off from the campaign would be a big deal for a democratic operative.  Even back then she was probably the favorite to win the democratic nomination and the presidency, so it could be as much as six years of being cut off from one of the most powerful people in the party.   Stuck  working in a Senator's office rather than the white house.  Working for a presidential campaign is the big leagues for people like that.

       Source on that?  How close a connection?  I mean, Podesta has been working in DC for decades.  He's probably two degrees of separation away from half the city.

       Look at my reply - as for the people in the hospital - George Webb, on youtube, is going around talking to police, witnesses, talking about the blackberries, 100,000's of emails, really good stuff, that's where i got the info that he was cordoned off and pretty much left to die from a non-fatal gunshot wound, where the doctors never seen anyone die from it

       George Webb is spewing nonsense. None of those people would ever talk to him, especially about any specific details. At best, he found a random doctor and asked them a bunch of hypotheticals.

       I agree.  It seems like all the people in DC are closely interconnected.  The whole conflict between the Democrats and Republicans is just for show.  It is to keep us from understanding how it all works.

       I don't know about that, but even if it isn't, he would still know tens of thousands of people in DC, even if he didn't agree with them.  The only connection I've seen between the doctor and Podesta is that they both went to the same party once.  Based on that people have decided that he could call him up and ask him to let someone under his care die as a favor.  It's ridiculous.

       I haven't seen anything saying what the exact connection is.  I've looked and all I've seen is they both attended a party along with 110 other people once.

       That's the same thing I read.  They invited that doctor to a fundraising party.  That's not much of a connection.  There were over 100 people there. You invite rich people to fundraisers.  Many doctors are rich.

       Besides that, where did the information that he worked on Seth at the hospital come from?

       I like how you pivoted from one thing and went off on a tangent.
      </p>
      <p>
       See.. this is why answering questions is a no-win situation. You said "explain the [alleged] code words." I stated it won't matter what he says unless it was "i rape boys," then you perfectly prove my point by going off on a tangent about 15 other things and totally ignore your first request about code words.
      </p>
      <p>
       That is why people don't necessarily take questions about a witch hunt. No win situation. "Prove to me you don't beat your wife"

       Not what i'm saying - there's plenty of other evidence for that - I'm just saying that the handkerchief code is known, and that a MAP is a minor attracted person, and pizza is child porn, literally, you go into dark web sites and they say they want a cheese pizza baked for 10 minutes 15 minutes 9 minutes - these are all ages - then you go to abromovic who's twitter handle was 666 before it was changed - i wonder why - not like she cuts pentagrams into her body - or has studied the occult her whole life and many different spiritual practices - and pours blood everywhere and paints with it on walls and eats human cakes... right... nothing to see here... oh wait john did this personally with her? omg at her appartment? oh wow that's soooo cooooool. Not like Crowley said a blue eyed white boy was the best sacrifice and to draw a circle to collect the blood and energy to harvest, not at all, nope nothing to see here folks.
