    <div class="md"><p>too much other evidence for pizzagate - there was the time that alefantis called a guy and threatened his life and families and knew that &quot;they&quot; were taking down a bunch of youtube videos - then there was the guy who found CP on the actual server for cometpingpong, not to mention Majestic Apes &quot;You&#39;re downstairs from subway - i hear jerry comes here often&quot; Implying pedophilia and laughing &quot;we all have our preferences&quot; and a weird laugh - lots of known pedophile symbols all around that place - and the hacker who got into the website which was encrypted and you needed passwords to download it - reported it to the police and was then harrassed with his car n shit broken - not to mention podesta&#39;s friendship with Frued - who raped and groomed girls as young as 10 - who shared a work room with Cyril Smith who is now known to have over a 100 child victims - who was repeatedly arrested and let go because of the power of the queen and her satanic army... Did i mention a 3 year old went missing when john and podesta were in portugal at Frueds Vista? where the PARENTS went afterwards... I reread the email though - not as damning as i thought - still shows he&#39;s willing to make an example of a leaker - even though he&#39;s refering to firing them or yelling at them in this case - but that&#39;s for leaking to the press for limelight - if you leaked the entire DNC email thing - i&#39;m sure you&#39;d have quite a bit of heat coming down on you - lets not forget Assange pretty much has confirmed this for us - that seth was the leaker... </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I like how you pivoted from one thing and went off on a tangent.</p>

<p>See.. this is why answering questions is a no-win situation. You said &quot;explain the [alleged] code words.&quot; I stated it won&#39;t matter what he says unless it was &quot;i rape boys,&quot; then you perfectly prove my point by going off on a tangent about 15 other things and totally ignore your first request about code words.</p>

<p>That is why people don&#39;t necessarily take questions about a witch hunt. No win situation. &quot;Prove to me you don&#39;t beat your wife&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just saw this comment and decided to provide an argument to it - as for the code words in the emails - it&#39;s really bizarre for someone to say &quot;hey I have your black with white handkerchief&quot; then it gets forwarded to someone saying &quot;I have your handkerchief that has a map that&#39;s pizza related with on it&quot; - i don&#39;t see how she can - without seeing the handkerchief - go from saying it&#39;s black w/ white to it having a pizza related map on it - you know this because she says the realtor can mail it to them still - <a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/32795">https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/32795</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not what i&#39;m saying - there&#39;s plenty of other evidence for that - I&#39;m just saying that the handkerchief code is known, and that a MAP is a minor attracted person, and pizza is child porn, literally, you go into dark web sites and they say they want a cheese pizza baked for 10 minutes 15 minutes 9 minutes - these are all ages - then you go to abromovic who&#39;s twitter handle was 666 before it was changed - i wonder why - not like she cuts pentagrams into her body - or has studied the occult her whole life and many different spiritual practices - and pours blood everywhere and paints with it on walls and eats human cakes... right... nothing to see here... oh wait john did this personally with her? omg at her appartment? oh wow that&#39;s soooo cooooool. Not like Crowley said a blue eyed white boy was the best sacrifice and to draw a circle to collect the blood and energy to harvest, not at all, nope nothing to see here folks. </p>

<p>Here&#39;s an email for John Podesta that&#39;s hard not to interpret murder or making someone disappear, especially in context... talking about a republican trying to pay to hide having sex eith young boys. Sounds to me like Podesta knows the meaning of that sentence well enough for it to be written to him, and that they are unhappy Dennis Hastert is making their paedophiliv activities public with his stunt.</p>

<p>&quot;Might be time for Denny to vanish to an indisclosed japanese island&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They leaked the fact that Hillary was starting up a campaign, and hiring marketing people to rebrand her.   She had not announced yet.    They probably told people being interviewed to keep it quiet, but maybe didn&#39;t go so far as to make them sign an NDA.   Being cut off from the campaign would be a big deal for a democratic operative.  Even back then she was probably the favorite to win the democratic nomination and the presidency, so it could be as much as six years of being cut off from one of the most powerful people in the party.   Stuck  working in a Senator&#39;s office rather than the white house.  Working for a presidential campaign is the big leagues for people like that.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know about that, but even if it isn&#39;t, he would still know tens of thousands of people in DC, even if he didn&#39;t agree with them.  The only connection I&#39;ve seen between the doctor and Podesta is that they both went to the same party once.  Based on that people have decided that he could call him up and ask him to let someone under his care die as a favor.  It&#39;s ridiculous.</p>

<p>I haven&#39;t seen anything saying what the exact connection is.  I&#39;ve looked and all I&#39;ve seen is they both attended a party along with 110 other people once.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not a freemason, so not much.  Secret society that a ton of powerful people supposedly belong to.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>No, I don&#39;t know exactly what you mean.  It&#39;s a small community and they all sort of know each other?</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Who is the outsider you are talking about?  Seth?  Podesta?</p>

<p>That&#39;s the same thing I read.  They invited that doctor to a fundraising party.  That&#39;s not much of a connection.  There were over 100 people there. You invite rich people to fundraisers.  Many doctors are rich.</p>

<p>Besides that, where did the information that he worked on Seth at the hospital come from?</p>
