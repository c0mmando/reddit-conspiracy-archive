       Snopes lists him as NOT missing:

       Yes, seriously. We're all about Seth Rich, but this guy was even deeper into the global shit sandwich of the Clinton Foundation â€“ resigned, fled and disappeared. I think that if he were really working for Schmidt, there would be at least some public demonstration that he exists at all, aside from a Twitter account that was silent between October and January.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean, Google, of all companies, should know that there's a controversy about him and would address it if he were well and thriving in their offices.

       Good lord everyone bringing up Seth Rich story in a negative light just stop it. Of course braverman is in deep but there's a BODY of Seth and he was the wikileaks leaker. Why else would Julian Assange retweet?
      </p>
      <p>
       So much doubt is being cast in these threads. Look in every thread and top comments are "enough of Seth rich already" it's been a few days. It was the same shit about pizzagate, people just began to dismiss it by default

       Because there is room for doubt and some users, myself included, wouldn't mind if this SethRich case would get its own subreddit, right now conspiracy looks like the playing ground for T_D's theories with little room for other topic.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not that seth rich's case is not interesting, it's that we get multiple threads per hour on what is basically air. And that is the same with PG, if the thread were limited to well researched argument or new evidence it'd be fine but right now it's 80% crap. For example, yall got wet for KDC all the while there was all indication it was gonna be a fluke. We go spammed with it, now add it up to all other equally useless thread and you generate fatigue in users who are not as invested in the micro of Seth Rich's death.

       I must say something must be going right. I have never seen MSM diverge from any semblance of reality this hard. Now, I don't think any good for us will really come from it. But while they are pouring resources into damage control like this, they are more apt to make mistakes, and they don't have those resources for shittier things.

       The Eric and Wendy Schmidt Family Foundation announced on Jan 18, 2017 that Eric Braverman was to be President of the "group."  Eric Schmidt was a Hillary donor, past CEO of Google, 116th richest person in world, member of Bilderberg and Trilateral Commission.
      </p>
      <p>
       Somehow Schmidt didn't mind getting his hands dirty with this caper.  Braverman, however, has not been seen in relation to the Schmidt foundation or anywhere else since the January announcement, below.
