       <p>
        KING,
       </p>
       <p>
        In view of your low grade, abnormal personal behavoir [sic] I will not dignify your name with either a Mr. or a Reverend or a Dr. And, your last name calls to mind only the type of King such as King Henry the VIII and his countless acts of adultery and immoral conduct lower than that of a beast.
       </p>
       <p>
        King, look into your heart. You know you are a complete fraud and a great liability to all of us Negroes. White people in this country have enough frauds of their own but I am sure they don't have one at this time anywhere near your equal. You are no clergyman and you know it. I repeat you are a colossal fraud and an evil, vicious one at that. You could not believe in God and act as you do. Clearly you don't believe in any personal moral principles.
       </p>
       <p>
        King, like all frauds your end is approaching. You could have been our greatest leader. You, even at an early age have turned out to be not a leader but a dissolute, abnormal moral imbecile. We will now have to depend on our older leaders like Wilkins, a man of character and thank God we have others like him. But you are done. Your "honorary" degrees, your Nobel Prize (what a grim farce) and other awards will not save you. King, I repeat you are done.
       </p>
       <p>
        No person can overcome facts, not even a fraud like yourself. Lend your sexually psychotic ear to the enclosure. You will find yourself in all your dirt, filth, evil and moronic talk exposed on the record for all time. I repeat — no person can argue successfully against facts. You are finished. You will find on the record for all time your filthy, dirty, evil companions, male and female giving expression with you to your hidious [sic] abnormalities. And some of them to pretend to be ministers of the Gospel. Satan could not do more. What incredible evilness. It is all there on the record, your sexual orgies. Listen to yourself you filthy, abnormal animal. You are on the record. You have been on the record — all your adulterous acts, your sexual orgies extending far into the past. This one is but a tiny sample. You will understand this. Yes, from your various evil playmates on the east coast to [redacted] and others on the west coast and outside the country you are on the record. King you are done.
       </p>
       <p>
        The American public, the church organizations that have been helping — Protestant, Catholic and Jews will know you for what you are — an evil, abnormal beast. So will others who have backed you. You are done.
       </p>
       <p>
        King, there is only one thing left for you to do. You know what it is. You have just 34 days in which to do it (this exact number has been selected for a specific reason, it has definite practical significant [sic]). You are done. There is but one way out for you. You better take it before your filthy, abnormal fraudulent self is bared to the nation.
       </p>

       It's crazy to me to see people who love freedom, privacy, and democratic values blindly stand in defense of this organization. It is not one to be trusted. I'm sure they also do a some good, but their history of violence and intimidation makes me question them.  I have no doubt that the FBI, like the CIA, has been involved in assassinations on US soil.

       Also look into what they did to Ernest Hemingway.

       It's also possible that MLK was an intel asset like Hemingway and was assigned to play a role, maybe unwittingly, in a public psyop.

       And when you finally realize this as an adult you discover it is truly institutionalized... That to even express such a thought triggers people around you to automatically distance themselves from you and/or consider you "crazy" or a "conspiracy nut." (Thanks to lifelong programming/propagandizing/brainwashing.)
      </p>
      <p>
       But it gets even worse when you are questioned for such expressions of thought during pre-employment background checks.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ah, the chilling effect of exercising your so-called "freedom" in America... where we are encouraged to protest as long as it's a harmless release of tension and frustration... but we must stop short of anything that might lead to unapproved change.
      </p>
      <p>
       Seriously, those background checks are sinister in terms of silencing people. You think "oh, I'll just use a pseudonym" but that means you've already self-distanced from those around you who might hear an alternative viewpoint... it leads people into small, safe echo chambers where dissent is shared with and confined to people who already agree with anything said...
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes, I've actually faced one of these background checks. It's creepy how much they know about us from our public discussions like this...
      </p>
      <p>
       It doesn't prevent most of us from finding lower level employment but the higher up you go the more risky it is...

       That is touching, but the only reason the public knows about this is because it was stolen from the archives. There were more of these letters to many people and none of them would have been in his desk had this not been leaked.
