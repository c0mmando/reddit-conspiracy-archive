<p>A lot of Middle-aged white males like you tend to be single.</p>

<p>You need to stop  thinking you have all the answers, because you don&#39;t. And for God&#39;s sake give up all that anger and hate, get outside and go camping for a while, no computer, no phone. Get some sunlight.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting analysis &#39;doctor&#39;. I&#39;m middle aged, have created a wonderful family with two teenage daughters and the boy is coming along, am at the best place with my wife of 18 years than I&#39;ve ever been (sex is amazing in your 40s) and I&#39;m a 1%er with no worries in life. </p>

<p>I came from a childhood physical, sexual abuse and poverty, but I &#39;pulled myself up from my bootstraps&#39;. </p>

<p>What you perceive as hate is simply someone trying to convey real world experiences that you&#39;ve never felt.</p>

<p>From the moment I was born, life has felt like a trial of unfortunate circumstances. Everyone has a complaint, no one has anything useful to offer, so I just keep on keepin&#39; on. </p>

<p>If I didn&#39;t come from a place of love, I would have killed myself by now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Uh, no. What I  perceive as &#39;hate&#39; is someone downvoting someone to a -66 score instead of just putting them on ignore after they got past -10 like any sane person would do. I do not think downvoting someone is &quot;trying to convey real world experiences&quot;, it&#39;s just downvoting someone in the dark.</p>

<p>The internet &quot;investigation&quot; of Seth Rich is as big a a waste of time as fucking pizzagate and it is just so convenient that it starts flooding the sub during Trump&#39;s middle East trip where  he is giving out billions to Israel and making 300 billion dollar arms deals to Saudi Arabia...yet, we have no money for health care or an infrastructure program that will actually be a help to people&#39;s lives.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well I and a few others are searching through a lot of shit to prove Seth had access to the DNCs voter database they were planning on illegally registering and voting for people. We have already found hidden messages in the DNC app, HRC app, and various other things he was working on. The whole WikiLeaks thing seems a distraction from the real issue of voter fraud. One netsec1 cracks their shit, it&#39;s game over. This is the reason the DNC will not give the FBI doj or CIA access to it&#39;s server, but 2 people have entire archives from July 4... Seth was just the street sign saying exit here and you&#39;ll find voter fraud. Thanks Tim.</p>

<p>You people might not like to hear it, but I think you need to. Seth Rich&#39;s murderer will not be caught, his case will never be resolved. These little flair ups of information and intrigue to his  case is not going to matter, in  1 year..shit, I&#39;ll say in 6 months he will be all but forgotten here in  <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, just like pizzagate and a dozen other minor dramas that will come up in that time.</p>
