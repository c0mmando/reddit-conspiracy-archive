        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>If you don&#39;t know by know, the MSM and TPTB are in the final stages of their New World Order.</p>

<p>In this phase, they are orchestrating a massive &quot;collapse&quot; of society, in which a &quot;new order&quot; will be offered to the masses as a way to usher in stability and order again. </p>

<p>This collapse has a few main elements to it. Obviously, they are engineering an incremental and slow financial implosion on a global scale. This is described by Ron Paul as a &quot;currency crisis&quot;. They are essentially systematically reducing  the purchasing power of our dollar, on purpose. This is being done on a global basis, the central Bankers of the world are most certainly convening and coordinating this at meetings such as the Bilderberg Conference.</p>

<p>Along with this economic collapse is a SOCIAL collapse. This is a very important part of the plan.</p>

<p>This is where they RAMP UP their tactics of division. Race, religion, gender, sexual preference, sports, anything they can do to pit us against each other.</p>

<p>In particular, as a Black male in my late 20&#39;s, I&#39;m seeing them programming the black culture with television and films.</p>

<p>Netflix originals like &quot;Dear White People&quot;, and films such as &quot;Straight Outta Compton&quot;, have concealed and implied meanings and themes of revolution, anger, police brutality, ect to them. </p>

<p>These productions always end up creating a sense of,</p>

<p>&quot;Yea...fuck yea. Go us! You know what, we HAVE been oppressed for all these years as blacks! Maybe it IS time for us to stand up eh?!&quot;</p>

<p>The social engineers want to <em>incite</em> that reaction from blacks, to make us vengeful and angry and blame whites people for all of our problems, and these messages are prevalent in many Netflix originals, films, web series, ect.</p>

<p>There is a new Tupac movie coming out with a central theme of &quot;African American oppression&quot; to it. I did NOT see this many films and productions like this being made until recently. <strong>The media and social engineers are definitely creating a hostile environment between all races and genders right now, and we need to expose this divide and conquer agenda.</strong></p>

<p>Here are some examples of specific scenes I&#39;ve found that promote this agenda  in film/tv that I&#39;m referring to.</p>

<p>Tupac Movie</p>

<p>The reason I&#39;m bringing this up, (and this isn&#39;t a very popular opinion for a black American male to be taking right now), is because I want to expose this divide and conquer agenda, and foil their &quot;orchestrated collapse&quot; plan. They cannot have a world government, if we stop them in their tracks with this planned division psyop. </p>

<p>Come together my friends. We are ALL oppressed by TPTB.</p>

<p>They&#39;ve been trying to divide the working class for... ever. The so called elite are aware we&#39;re awakening, and they are trying to misdirect our anger. We must focus on unity! Race ain&#39;t shit, class is the important thing. We are being herded in their directions.

    <div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t get me wrong, racism is real, systemic, etc., and is more frequently an insidious pressure on gut reactions that make a person more or less likely to assume things about people (and treat them accordingly without any requirement for intentional cruelty). </p>

<p>That said, class unity is a lot more woke than any kind of identity politics that doesn&#39;t recognize that the 99.9% are more similar to one another than they are to the 0.1%, and telling people that they&#39;re racist is a lot less likely to reduce racism than getting a lot of people together and ensuring that they work toward something.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes I agree it&#39;s all about class.</p>

<p>If we all stopped fighting each other and realized we all have 1 thing in common: We&#39;re ALL being oppressed by the same people, a small group of wealthy elites to convene to establish a global government.</p>

<p>Once we figure that out, it&#39;s game over. Thats why they put all this trouble into getting us to fight each other.</p>

<p>BUT! If we <em>expose</em> that to the masses, and they find out they have simply been &quot;tricked&quot;, we can all unite and overthrow these counts once and for all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Consider carefully what you mean when you talk about &quot;class&quot;.  In this context &quot;<em>class</em>&quot; is all about money.<br/>
* <strong>The myth of the middle class:</strong>  In America, there is a myth that there are basically 3 classes: the rich, a huge middle class and the poor.  Almost everyone considers themselves to be part of this supposed massive middle class.  But really, we need to start talking about the working class again, (and not in a perjorative sense as if anyone in the working class is a dumb, racist redneck).<br/>
* <strong>Distractions:</strong>   TPTB have set it up so that the working class is constantly shown examples of poor people receiving government &quot;giveaways&quot;.  That way, the working class is resentful of poor people --- and we (who should be allies) are kept divided.<br/>
* <strong>Be vigilant and don&#39;t let TPTB direct us:</strong>  We <em>MUST</em> remind ourselves to look instead at the super wealthy, the global corporations and their government puppets as the real beneficiaries of government subsidies.<br/>
The bulk of our tax dollars, the fruit of our labors, is <em>siphoned directly upward to the super-wealthy and global corporations</em> -- and NOT to the poor (and NOT to the working class, and NOT to small businesses, and NOT for our infrastructure, and NOT for health care, and NOT for education...on and on and on.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>OK, I see what you mean.  You&#39;re right that there are other factors besides money that go into determining which class you&#39;re in.  It can be difficult to determine that during generational shifts or when a typically &quot;blue collar&quot; person is very monetarily successful.  Interesting topic.</p>

<p>And yes - shareholders - the CEOs love to say that everything they do is for the shareholder - and the shareholder is supposed to be able to reign them in if they&#39;re doing something wrong.  But shareholders don&#39;t do it, won&#39;t do it, or are too diffuse to do it.  Not a true check.  </p>

<div class="comment mb-3 ml-4" data-depth="4" data-id="dhrqa3c">
    <p class="byline text-muted mb-0"><a href="javascript:;" class="score"><span class="badge badge-secondary"></span></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/Oof_too_Humid.html">Oof_too_Humid</a> 2017-05-19</p>
    <div class="md"><p>If you want to play the &quot;<em>entitlements</em>&quot; game, the corporate giveaways can also be characterized as “entitlements”.  Either way, they are giveaways and it’s easy enough to show that corporate welfare -- like subsidies, tax breaks, no-bid government contracts, write-offs -- has begun to dwarf government spending on humans and our requisite infrastructure (which businesses NEED to thrive).<br/>
But we could go back and forth on this all day.    </p>

<p>More importantly - can we find any common ground?  How about small businesses?<br/>
Small businesses, through the marketing of an extreme and false “free market” narrative &amp; through the <em>national</em> chamber of commerce, have been sold a bill of goods.<br/>
* U.S. small businesses are often constructively barred from government contracts through overly regulated and convoluted bidding procedures -- to the benefit of huge corporations.   All of those regulated bidding procedures don&#39;t sound very &quot;free market&quot; to me.<br/>
* U.S. small businesses also suffer as global corporations move production overseas.   The Trans Pacific Partnership (NAFTA on steroids) would have helped make that happen. That&#39;s very good for business -- big business. But again, the TPP was 5,544 pages of regulations that took away local sovereignty.  Not very &quot;free market&quot;.  My point here is that what&#39;s good for &quot;business&quot; is not necessarily good for smaller businesses.         </p>

<p>What happens when the plant moves away?   Instead of a decent paying factory job, now the former employees have shit jobs that don’t pay shit.  They’re lucky if they can get a job at Wal-Mart pushing carts in the parking lot (where, thanks to low, low wages, the Wal-mart H.R. office gives out applications for government food assistance --- hmmm,  who are we subsidizing?)  Those workers can’t buy things at small businesses in their communities any more.  They can’t buy houses, or sporting goods, or sandwiches at the deli.  They can’t hire someone to put a new roof on the house.  They can’t pay someone to teach their kid piano.<br/>
I’m not necessarily advocating a big systemic change in the U.S., but this crap has gone too far, and too much wealth is being siphoned upwards.      </p>

<p>When will it be too far for you?  Will it be when only a select few wealthy groups must live in heavily guarded, gated communities to keep out roving hordes of hungry people?   Will it be when sick people are dying in gutters?  Or will it be when even those lucky select few in the gated communities move out of the U.S. to live in safer, remote locations.  If you’re posting on conspiracy, you must see that a continual concentration of wealth undermines a healthy “middle class”.  If the U.S. is to keep a capitalist system, then something has to give.  What do you and I have in common? </p>

I&#39;m not quite middle age, but I have noticed this as far back as a decade ago.  Young people should definitely not be allowed access, or at least restricted use of social media.  There may be some positive to it for the developing brain, but training new hires (typically 18-20 age) the past 14 years I&#39;ve noticed an alarming frequency of them being very uncomfortable socially.  And it&#39;s not just nerves or new environment or some typical reason for people to be uncomfortable.  Lets say, out of the last 100 employees I trained, 75 of them are extremely awkward and uncomfortable socially.  That&#39;s ingrained behavior, not natural stress for people socially acclimated.</p>

Less and less people talk to strangers in real life and even less talk to people that may have prejudices against. For me top 3 best eye opening convos I have had were with a female to male person who I didnt suspect was until an hour later, linebacker sized bald white guy felon who is the nicest and most street smart person I know, and a guy from Yemen who gave me a view is 911 while he was in Yemen (similar shock and horror was what he felt, and overwhelming sadness for so many innocent lives lost.) </p>

<p>Agreed completely. There is a website called Media Take Out. It is without a doubt the bottom of the barrel. It might actually be the outside where the barrel sits on the ground. It&#39;s cancer. </p>

<p>However, take a look at what they post. It&#39;s ALWAYS pro-black anti-white (if it is a race topic) with race-baiting comment battlefields every time. I also noticed that whenever a black celebrity is with a white person (typically male--&gt;female) since that Get Out movie dropped they ask is ______ in a......sunken place? as if it truly is real. </p>

<p>Looking back Key &amp; Peele are nothing but propaganda. The &quot;angry translator&quot; schtick is unbelievable and appalling </p>

  I am sick of the hate, lies and pain I see everyday, slithering from the mouths of politicians, the twisted logic of corporations, the blathering from ALL religious leaders and the payed for commentary of the talking heads that is spewed into my ears by those on the &quot;News&quot;.
We have the resources, Technology and now- the Will to create a life were EVERYONE can live a relatively happy, well feed, healthy and educated existence. That existence would be filled with Love for our fellow man and a true sense of wonder at the fact that we ALL are on a rock that orbits a Sun, hurtling through space to an unknown destination. 
 I will be spending my time reminding myself that I deserve Love- in all its forms, because, I am tired of saying &quot;Why?&quot; I want to say &quot;Why not?&quot;
  Thank you margaritavilllll, for starting the conversation. See you at the Family reunion, Brother.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Pretty much all music from nearly any genre that has lyrical content references sex, drugs and violence. Hell, most modern country songs are about fucking and getting drunk. The Beatles sang about getting high, NWA rapped about shooting cops, Motley Crue sang about strip clubs, Led Zeppelin sang about sex, 2 Live Crew were quite literally &quot;Banned In The USA&quot; for obscene shows. All of these things happened pre-1990.</p>

<p>I&#39;m guessing you&#39;re younger, but music has been this way since the 50&#39;s -- it&#39;s expression and it&#39;d be a real conspiracy if it artistic expression was at all compromised with censorship.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The truth hurts I guess. We&#39;re going backwards not forwards  once the white population dies out their culture goes with them (including all of the social services, Charity, and ect). Despite the propaganda, it is a historical fact that it was white christian disporia who ended the slave trade. Christianity, has always been primarily a white thing, and the moral tenants, and even lingo are all throughout their culture. But now? (mainly thanks to the media and second varian council) It is an utter joke, women go to church and do not dress modestly, homosexuals are allowed in the church, women act like men, and men act like women (which goes against gods design) and satanic symbology is everywhere. It is all about love and self worship&#39;. Heck, some pastors who lead churches do not even take it seriously and are practically atheist. Why do the J hate whites so much? Because they know that the whites are the remnants of Judahites, and Jacob. If it was any other race the J (self-admiited edomites) would not be trying to wipe them out so adamantly. The “I know your works, tribulation, and poverty (but you are rich); and I know the blasphemy of those who say they are Jews and are not, but are a synagogue of Satan.” should actually be: &quot;“I know your works, tribulation, and poverty (but you are rich); and I know the blasphemy of those who say they are Judean and are not, but are a temple of Satan.”</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agree OP, we keep our shit together and the whole thing might still work out. </p>

<p>Lately I&#39;ve been thinking that our very common, shorthand use of the terms black and white has an inherent tendency to drive our discourse to extremes, because these words represent opposites.  So discussion gets artificially nudged into full-contrast mode.</p>

<p>Reality is a lot more nuanced.  Nobody&#39;s white. Pink, maybe.  But white?  Nope.  Nobody&#39;s black either.  Rich deep brown perhaps, but not black.  </p>

<p>When we think habitually in these terms, it&#39;s like chess or spy vs spy.  Same thing with red and blue (opposite ends of the spectrum) and the left-right the sideshow of politics that&#39;s painted for us, always seeking to lateralize our energies away from the up-down axis. </p>

<p>Violet Brown is the oldest living human right now (in Jamaica).  She&#39;s 117.  This means 117 years ago, we were an entirely different batch of human beings.  </p>

<p>Earth&#39;s human population has <em>more than quadrupled</em> in her lifetime.  It will not keep going up at the same rate, it can&#39;t.   But our monetary systems are built on principles of growth.  </p>

<p>There is a huge difference between the western Jew and an Israeli. So much of a difference calling them the same racial name these days seems a mistake. No western Jew that I have ever met supports Israel. Every last one of them thinks the country has a serious case of abused child syndrome and is trying to replay the Holocaust on Palestine. They don&#39;t support this at all. I don&#39;t see any outside of the Orthodox types supporting what is happening there. </p>

<p>And yet they practice segregation (trials of different buses for Palestinians), collective punishment, genocide (malaysian court found them guilty of war crimes), eugenics (gave african women sterilisation injections without informing them) in Israel.

<p>As I said in the last post, the two shouldn&#39;t even be sharing the same name anymore. The Israeli is every bit as you described. I&#39;ve only met two, but both were some of the worst types. I know western Jews by the score. Some are wealthy, some are dirt poor. Some go to the synagogue, some don&#39;t. None support Israel or any of the ideals you believe they do. In fact the one western Jew I did know that was like that is now in his mid to late 80&#39;s and was a pretty hardcore conservative.</p>

<p>Few, if any western Jews have any kind of notion about &quot;tribe&quot;. This is an Israeli/Orthodox Jewish notion. These types are so rare in America that I don&#39;t think they make a single percentage point in the population.</p>

<p>The ones who want your race wars are your wealthy conservative and hard core Christian types. These people have historically regarded blacks and incidentally Jews as inferior and their assault on these races have been well documented. So Jews dominate Hollywood.

<p>Try 99% of American Jews are traitors by his standards. People like him are why most Jews have flocked away from being Jewish. Most Jews do not identify with him at all. He represents one 1% of the entire population of Jews giving a shit about a different 1% of the entire population of Jews. The other 98% are not interested in any way. As for 9-11. That the Jews did it is a new one on me. And they somehow recruited 19 of their sworn enemies and somehow kept them in line for three years of preparation and the hijacking, and somehow convinced these people to off themselves for the Jewish cause to boot. That, I must admit, is almost as good as the idea of secretly rigging the entire place for demolitions in the space of a single night.</p>

<p>If they have such an app I can tell you for certain that it doesn&#39;t work. I bash pro Israeli types all the time and without impunity and no ones shown up being like that.

<p>These firemen said they counted 3 explosions. The Police/FBI are reported to have attributed this to vans with explosives in the WTC basement:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfxkcBmZfK0">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfxkcBmZfK0</a></p>

<p>You can also see raw footage (ie. not altered to show a CG plane) that shows the missile impacting the WTC (no plane):</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wF74zTLjNg">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wF74zTLjNg</a></p>

<p>You can see a comparison showing the NBC footage showing no plane was digitally altered to show a plane (as well as adjust the colors to make the buildings appeared white and sky blue for increased psychological impact):</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPKq2K2dh6k">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPKq2K2dh6k</a></p>

<p>The altered footage in some cases is obviously fake, for example tiling smoke:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkzfKRe0gbc">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkzfKRe0gbc</a></p>

<p>But what wasn&#39;t CG was the explosions and the plane cutout shape they created. You can see those small explosions here (6 minute mark):</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rT1z90BB8E4&amp;amp;feature=endscreen&amp;amp;NR=1">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rT1z90BB8E4&amp;amp;feature=endscreen&amp;amp;NR=1</a></p>

<p>The cutting charges were planted by Israeli Mossad posing as art students who rented a whole floor and got construction permits at the site, and made a temporary balcony. They even made a book about their &quot;art&quot; - which showed them standing next to boxes and boxes of explosives fuses in the WTC!</p>

<p><a href="http://winteractionables.com/?p=25207">http://winteractionables.com/?p=25207</a></p>

<p>Mossad agents filmed the missile impacts/explosions (to add CG planes later and pass on to media) and later went up to the roof to plant radio jamming devices. They were arrested and this is documented by the FBI. There was traces of explosives in their van and they were set up filming BEFORE the attack:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.scribd.com/collections/4010452/9-11-The-Dancing-Israelis-FBI-report">https://www.scribd.com/collections/4010452/9-11-The-Dancing-Israelis-FBI-report</a></p>

<p>Let me stress that again, the FBI arrested dancing Israelis on 911, not muslims. They refused to take lie detector tests for months, and when they did, they failed. So much of that FBI report is redacted, proof positive of guilt.</p>

<p>They needed to fake plane impacts because a real plane would be shredded by the WTC like cheese through a grater. That&#39;s why when the Transasia plane collided with a taxi, the wing broke off, and the taxi wasn&#39;t sliced in half at all:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQ29Zr7wWnw">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQ29Zr7wWnw</a></p>

<p>According to a WTC architect in a 80s interview, the impact of a plane (300 tonnes) is nothing compared to the 13,000 tonnes of force trying to push the WTC over simply because of its enormous surface area.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E15GbdVaV-Q">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E15GbdVaV-Q</a></p>

<p>WTC project management engineer atttests the buildings could survive multiple plane impacts.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fQlC2AIWrY">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fQlC2AIWrY</a></p>

<p>The WTC designers did a study for 600mph-1 impact which showed the towers would easily withstand the 911 attack.</p>

<p><a href="http://911research.wtc7.net/wtc/analysis/design.html">http://911research.wtc7.net/wtc/analysis/design.html</a></p>

<p>Someone planted an engine (though wrong make) to further the plane deception:</p>

<p><a href="/r/conspiracy/comments/34o4y0/911_engine_that_shot_out_of_the_south_tower_was/">/r/conspiracy/comments/34o4y0/911_engine_that_shot_out_of_the_south_tower_was/</a></p>

<p>Essentially the media got punked by Israel, because journalists just report what they&#39;re told. You can see another example of newscasters being fooled by a movie set into thinking it&#39;s a real plane accident. At the 7 minute mark in this video:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wozTHxykDwQ">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wozTHxykDwQ</a></p>

<p>The larger 911 plan required the destruction of the Washington bridge and Lincoln tunnel. That would take out the fiber optic cables linked to stock market/banking, markets would have crashed and there would be martial law introduced. You can see this TV report on the other Israeli vans that were intercepted, one of them exploded:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmpWe2Rhi_I">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmpWe2Rhi_I</a></p>

<p>Israeli companies moved out of the building months before the attack. Israelis in America were warned in advance through an Israeli messaging service:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.haaretz.com/odigo-says-workers-were-warned-of-attack-1.70579">http://www.haaretz.com/odigo-says-workers-were-warned-of-attack-1.70579</a></p>

<p>Hundreds of Israelis were flown out of America, despite a flight ban, to avoid them being arrested by the FBI, including the &quot;art students&quot;:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/israel/1387069/US-arrests-200-young-Israelis-in-spying-investigation.html">http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/israel/1387069/US-arrests-200-young-Israelis-in-spying-investigation.html</a></p>

<p>Israel is the almost only country that benefited from the September 11 th attacks. In the words of Netanyahu, &quot;it&#39;s good for Israel&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s important to understand that there is a heck of a lot of racism still in todays world. There&#39;s no way to accurately measure how much. Some places more than others obviously. I find it so important as a white person to be aware of the past and to know that black people suffered as the subject of horrifying racism, I&#39;m not saying we (all white people today) should be held accountable but we do need to take what happened and learn from it by never EVER doing anything of the sort, I hate it when people say &quot;why should I feel guilty about something I had nothing to do with&quot;, on a level yes but also you should feel guilty because what happened makes me feel so fucking sick and I feel guilty about it and I think people should feel shame too. What fucks me off the most is how people in the media look down and probably just laugh at us all going nuts at each other as soon as a story like &quot;black man killed by white cop&quot; breaks, because it brings up the same arguments every time and creates a divide. I mean fuck the people who say &quot;fuck all whites&quot; and fuck the people who say &quot;fuck all blacks&quot; but a large amount of these people have been brainwashed by the media into thinking that racist behavior is rampant everywhere when that&#39;s just not the case...</p>

<p>Racism obviously used to be SOOO much worse and it&#39;s gotten a lot better, I hope people wake up and don&#39;t fall into this divide war- cos if they don&#39;t racism over time will just get less and less popular... But that&#39;s only if the media can address it appropriately and people aren&#39;t so 2 sided about it.... is my opinion anyway :P
Peace man, I&#39;m glad you don&#39;t mind speaking up against the obvious divide war as a black person!! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes love that video. I have a small feeling in 10-30 years a lot of these old racists farts die out. Then we&#39;ll only have these fake Trump supporters and uneducated folk to deal with :P 
But seriously though, if people are so easily led into this wormhole of labeling and stereotyping(even though they are trying to speak against it, they actually exacerbate it) maybe it might be easy to lead them out of it... who knows. I think time and education is our best option when it comes to racism. Not headlines every single day about &quot;black person did x &quot; or &quot;black people say x about x&quot;  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The word &#39;Racisim&#39; was a word invented by Communist as a means of control.  Yes people said  bad shit about each other, but it&#39;s even worse now (but hidden) People used to be able to have a joke with black/white people about black/white things.It was all just fun and laughter and not supposed to be serious. But now people are over sensitised to &#39;racisim&#39; and are so worried about offending someone that its all hidden and bubbling under the surface. They can&#39;t express themselves without fear of being labeled so more and more divide is subversively formed.</p>

The authors of The Bell Curve are conservative political scientists and this was nothing more than propaganda totally in demand at the time, when neoliberalism was hip and &quot;welfare queens&quot; the target of presidential campaigns. Their findings aren&#39;t cited by any reputable researchers because they&#39;re so illegitimate.</p>

If you watch some of the main stream media about a year or two ago when there were riots about black that got killed by cops even if they were in the wrong. Another if a white person were to make a movie called Dear Black People black people would be mad about it which they have the right to since they&#39;re are directing that to all black people in a stereotypical way.

I don&#39;t understand why I am being attacked here because I didn&#39;t like a movie. If I don&#39;t like it why do I have to continue to force myself to watch it, and hope that it gets better for me?</p>

<p>Yep, you just analyzed the propaganda perfectly.</p>

<p>They&#39;re trying to appeal to our <em>emotions</em>, not our reason and common sense. Some of us are susceptible to it. But in my interactions on the street, from what I see, most white people get along with black people fine. I see no real hostility between races/genders in my everyday interactions at all.</p>

<p>I think the elite are overestimating how effective their propaganda really still is on us. </p>

<p>In the book, Uncle Tom is the Jesus like hero that is such a good and honest man that his Slave Masters can&#39;t bear to keep him as a slave anymore and let him go. Tom forgives them for their sins and lives free. This amazing story and character were completely defamed and slandered by the Left and made &quot;Uncle Tom&quot; into a dirty word.

<p>That&#39;s not what Uncle Tom refers to. It refers to any black person that &quot;acts white&quot; or &quot;talks white&quot; or has any kind of political view that isn&#39;t completely leftist. It doesn&#39;t have to do with &quot;a black person hurting their own race&quot;. How does trying to speak proper english do that?</p>

<p>He&#39;s called a &quot;sellout&quot; because he treats everyone with love and obeys his masters so other people don&#39;t get whipped. He obeys and doesn&#39;t run away because Eliza and George Harris have already. When he treats his masters with love and respect even though they treat him horribly, that&#39;s what actually changes things. </p>

<p>It&#39;s a perversion of the meaning and sentiment of the book to say he sold out his race. This is why the Left is so disgusting. They take what should be an iconic positive role model for black people and turn it into the worst possible insult. Then they poison the water with Jay Z and Beyonce/BLM type victimhood bullshit. It&#39;s sickening. </p>

<p>A sellout. Why would we need to make an inspirational black literary character into a racialized version of a sellout? What would be the motivation for &quot;early black nationalists&quot; to make a self-defeating term out of this character?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The day I stopped thinking there was any difference between blacks and whites whatsoever, was the day I realised that both groups kill members of both their own group and each other.  Whites kill whites, blacks kill blacks.  The only reason why anyone cared about Trayvon Martin was because it wasn&#39;t another black person who killed him.  Black gang related killing is viewed as background noise.</p>

<p>I have lived among black Maoris from New Zealand, and white Dutch Afrikaans from South Africa.  In terms of their values and behaviour, from everything I have ever seen, the two groups are identical.  They are very fiercely family oriented, and extremely violent.  </p>

<p>Both of said groups are people who I feel extremely comfortable around.  This is because, paradoxically speaking, violence is a sufficiently large part of their lives, that they have a very controlled and realistic attitude towards it.  When violence happens, they recognise the context of that particular fight, and respond accordingly.  If a family member has taken a swipe at one of them as part of a routine argument, then they might give them a single punch to the side of the head back, and that will be the end of it, with neither of them really injured.  If the fight is between themselves and a member of a rival group, however, and said rival member is employing near lethal force themselves, then the response will be very different.</p>

<p>Any claim of any group being more &quot;civilised,&quot; than any of the rest of us is simply rubbish.  None of us are.  There is virtually no one alive who does not have a trigger which will cause them to become berserk.  Some might be harder to find or set off than others, but the difference is a matter of degree.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know that no group is a true monolith and I hate talking about something as broad as &quot;the opinion of black folks&quot; but I think that being pissed is a totally valid reaction, I know I would be.</p>

<p>Black people have traditionally been profiled, targeted, segregated by either law or economics, and not given &quot;fair treatment&quot; under the law. However this is the fault of TPTP, not just white people. We are all under the same boot but as means of control some groups get a bit more pressure on the back of their neck.</p>

<p>I&#39;m a big believer that education is the most important step to freeing ourselves from the oppressive yolk. When we stop squabbling about who is a conservative or a liberal, black or white, Christian or Muslim we will have defeated TPTP&#39;s super weapon in the divide and conquer narrative. </p>

<p>I guess the crux of my point is that we should validate this anger for a great series of injustices have been committed but we should also try to help people that are angry channel it toward the cause of the suffering. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have a hard time taking this seriously because the things you bring up are just entertainment. Writers, directors, producers share their point of view on stuff and maybe they are angry about aspects of society and put that into the art they make. Its quite a leap to suggest a police brutality scene in a biopic about a rap group will turn people against each other as opposed to the proven and documented cases of that type of thing happening in the real world. </p>

<p>I fully understand and agree that there is a divide and conquer strategy employed by governments and powerful people/organizations in order to keep focus away from the most rich and powerful. That has been the case for centuries in America. First and always black people were the problem, then Irish, then Italians, then the Mexicans etc. and so on. All scapegoats the powerful like to point to and say &quot;See? that&#39;s why we can&#39;t propser, the fucking Irish!&quot; and its a distraction.</p>

<p>If their policy to sow distrust and division is to make movies sympathetic to the struggles some black people have then they are completely inept. Its as simple to avoid as not clicking &quot;Dear White People&quot; on Netflix. Also, I think there is an opposite argument to be made here. Movies and TV are ways for some to see glimpses of people&#39;s lives that are completely foreign and humanize them. The more we recognize that we aren&#39;t fundamentally different the better off we will be and I think it&#39;s possible for art like movies to make that happen, just as much as it can be used for division.</p>

<p>See, this shit right there is whats wrong, what starts the divide. You&#39;re probably not African-American. You&#39;re just American. You&#39;ve never been to Africa. You&#39;ve never lived there. You&#39;re just a different skin tone.</p>

<p>If it was a Eurpoean country you&#39;d presume they lived there first. If I called myself a German-American people would assume I&#39;ve lived there. Same thing with any other &quot;white&quot; country. France, Sweden etc. But not Asian, Mexican or another &quot;minority&quot;.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a subtle double standard that starts this shit off. Stop identifying your self as something else, just be an American. We all need to come together so lets just all be Humans or American or what have you.</p>

<p>Not at all. There are literally thousands of German-American clubs and German-American societies all across the United States. There are major pockets in this country where peoples German heritage is take <em>very</em> seriously. Places in Wisconsin, Pennsylvanian, and elsewhere, where people call themselves German-Americans despite having been here for many generations.</p>

<p>The same holds true for Italian-Americans, Polish-Americans, and others.</p>

<p>And besides, the fact of the matter is, life as a black person in the United States is different than life as a white person. The idea that we can just pretend that isn&#39;t the case and issues of race will just go away is naive at best and minimizes the issues black Americans face at worst.</p>

<p>Yeah, I live in Wisconsin. That&#39;s not true at all. Not even the old people that actually lived in germany call themselves german americans. Sure, we&#39;ve got a shit load of german heritage, but people don&#39;t run around calling themselves German-Americans. Ever. If they did, it would be assumed they&#39;ve mostly lived in Gremany and just got here or something.</p>

<p>TPTB don&#39;t just want to divide humans by ethnicity, they want to divide us by the shade of our skin. If it weren&#39;t for all the white shaming, I&#39;m sure there would be a similar caste system on the rise among white people as well. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s great you can see this now...because as a black man <sup><sup>TM,</sup></sup> I didn&#39;t figure it out until well into my 30&#39;s, but if you truly care about bridging the divide, the first thing you need to do is drop the African American part when you introduce yourself.  That label was designed by the left to divide us from other Americans.  Guess what, it worked.  It worked so well we have blacks at Harvard getting their own graduation ceremony.  </p>

<p>Look at it this way, maybe one of your distant ancestors 8-10 generations ago descended from Africa, but unless you personally immigrated from a country on the African continent (which is not homogeneous) you are simply black, or American if you like.  I am black.  Neither my parents, nor their parents, not their parents, nor even their parents ever set foot on the continent of Africa.  There are white Africans who immigrate to American and are actual African Americans.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Obligatory self description: I&#39;m a white guy, 30, just spent two years living in Haiti. I learned a lot about the history of slavery over that period and I honestly can&#39;t believe that there isn&#39;t more anti-white backlash in the US, or at least more Malcolm X types preaching resistance to the structural racism we see in the criminal justice system, public housing system, education system, etc.</p>

<p>That said, I wanted to comment because the exact same thing you&#39;ve noticed is happening on the other side. Conservative talk radio is convincing the white working class that we live in a post-racist America where anyone who&#39;s struggling simply hasn&#39;t worked hard enough. It&#39;s not just one side pitting side A against side B. It almost feels like there&#39;s a bipartisan consensus at the top to keep as many people down as possible.</p>

<p>I can only speak for myself and maybe it&#39;s because I live in a diverse area but 9 out of 10 whites I know don&#39;t hold any ill will towards blacks at all.</p>

All Donald did was ramp up the division and hatred as much as he could.
Edit: and dont come talking to me about &quot;da media&quot; because I know damn well the media is full of shit and bought and paid for. But you cannot deny Donald Trump posting asinine shit on his Twitter like: <a href="https://twitter.com/thehill/status/668587042268426240/photo/1?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fthinkprogress.org%2Fmedia%2Ff06122f9240d6d303952399786f559d0%3FpostId%3D125064da6372">this</a>, and spewing his BS about making America great <em>again</em>. When exactly was is great? When schools were segregated and black people and women weren&#39;t allowed to vote?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have been thinking the same thing (white female here) but also have become very aware at how previous attempts to solidify world domination (i.e. slavery and human trafficking) have definitely made many whites feel a false sense of superiority. The book The Bell Curve is a great example of this. Conservative white political scientists used longitudinal data taken from the 80s to declare that nonwhites and nonAsians are <em>genetically</em> intellectually inferior. The only attention they ever paid to disparate schooling, class identities, primary languages, etc. was to say they couldn&#39;t know whether those things affected IQ or not. This book was a huge hit and Sam Harris recently did a podcast interviewing and defending the author. These kinds of  subtle (even tho not really subtle) racist rationalizations I think hypnotize whites into feeling special, and spark more conflict among different groups. It&#39;s so necessary for the powers that be to depend on &quot;genetic&quot; superiority to justify their actions. And of course everyone in power isn&#39;t just white. But the nonwhites who rise to the top are &quot;special&quot;, their evidence proving that &quot;anyone can pull himself up by the bootstraps&quot; and make it to the top. This narrative encourages ruthless competition, betrayal, immorality, etc. It&#39;s awful.</p>

<p>What you reference seems to me like the liberal take on this kind of societal manipulation. Being &quot;woke&quot; makes that person better than everyone who isn&#39;t up to date on the latest social nuance of progressiveness. Any political or cultural misstep will  be blasted across social media and might even cost the apparent heretic her job. The media is fanning the fire on all levels, from making these films to antagonizing nonwhite Trump supports and branding them as race traitors.</p>

<p>I think they (the powerful institutions/media) can tell that racial relations in America have improved significantly over a relatively short amount of time, considering African American slaves weren&#39;t even constitutional human beings 250 years ago. And they can see that white people are getting just as fed up as nonwhite people with the system, and they want to create a new class of &quot;elite&quot; subservient followers who defend this great charade of greed and violence masked as righteousness. And they&#39;re so good at it - one program showcases Tupac as a grassroots hero, the next one covers all the black men arrested earlier that day, the next one shows a sad woman and child in their hijabs among rubble created by &quot;our enemy&quot;, followed by a commercial begging you to donate to dirty starving brown children in some dilapidated rainforest shanty town.</p>

<p>We need to start calling this shit out. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>As a white 30s female, I wish the world had more black men like you around. It&#39;s so obvious MSM and Hollywood have an agenda to divide the two major races in this country. </p>

<p>I want to share a remarkable example of a student I not only will never forget but still look forward to when I run into her mother at her place of employment when I chance there. I will call this student K. I was a high school special education teacher that not only taught but had a case load for students with learning and behavior issues that attended classes with the general population. K was an extremely intelligent black 9th athletic student with a history of behavior issues raging from minor to severe. In junior high she had cornered a student into an empty classroom and harassed them severely. The student was white and the parents were concerned and went to the police. When K entered 9th grade her teachers addressed concerns with me that she was bullying students and teachers. This happened during the first few months K entered my case load. I knew it was time for action and reviewed her files. I will not lie that I was anxious as the mandatory meeting between K mother grew closer. I had very many past experiences with parents of my black students that did not end proactively. As a result their child suffered because they did not actively address the behavior issues. </p>

<p>In short the meeting I had with K mother, which included K, her coach, a general education teacher, and the school counselor, was the most proactive and effective meetings I ever held for a student. We all worked together to create a behavior plan for K. Not only did K never have another behavior issue during her 4 years in high school, but she was a role model for students of all races in the school. She transformed from a bully into a student respected by students, teachers, and administrators. I believe that her academic progress was a direct result of her behavior progress. She graduated and I know she was admitted to a local private 4 year college with an athletic scholarship. </p>

<p>Unfortunately, cases like K were rare for me. Had she not had a supported home environment that put her best needs ahead of racial unjust entitlements there&#39;s a high probability that she would had confused behavior issues, kicked off of her athletic team, and failing grade. It&#39;s also a probability that she might not have received her high school diploma let alone accepted into a college. </p>

<p>We cannot control what MSM pushes into our lives; however, as parents we can educate our younger generations to think for themselves. We can teach them that the media and entertainment industry has an alternative agenda to use issues that cause high emotional responses to pad their pocket books. Had K mother not empowered herself and her daughter with integrity and intelligent problem solving skills, I believe that meeting would have had a completely different ending. </p>

<p>As a white educator my actions were also a factor that could have further proved or discredited the agenda of MSM. I could not let the false accusations cause me to be a jilted white woman. I could not allow being accused as racist prevent me from continuing my role as an educator with my integrity. I could not ignore behavior students in fear of being accused of as racist, nor could I actively set out to &quot;find&quot; behavior issues in a certain race. I had to continue to see all students as a whole not separated by the color of their skin or their religion. I stood my ground but did not weaken it with perceived ideas. I cannot speak for every educator, and I certainly will not figure point or question other educators integrity unless I have blunt proof that they have alternative motives behind their actions. </p>

<p>I know their is injustice in the world toward different racial groups. However, where does the message that reenforces these injustices start? I don&#39;t think we can change the increasing attention pointed out by MSM and Hollywood, but we can do our part in our own homes and workplaces. Address or report racist attitudes from members of our own races, and educate the younger generations that we all have to put the trivial physically traits aside and stop using labels. We have to start seeing the human race as one and whole. Nothing can be accomplished until these factors take place. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, its just Hollywood realising that people have become not racist enough that black led movies are proffitable and their is a million and one scripts already lined up for such an occasion. Black people are like twice as likely to see a movie and they are utilizing this by giving a lot of black directors and actors a little cash to make small budget movies that will make huge profits.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lots of stuff to unpack here.... one thing I will say is in response to the criticism of Dear White People (what the hell kind of dumb, poor quality video did you even link to here?). Seems like the only people who criticize it have not watched the show, only the trailer(s).  </p>

<p>It wasn&#39;t the greatest show ever, but it isn&#39;t just some slanderous anti-white &quot;reverse racism&quot; show that people portray it to be. It&#39;s a fictional show set in a fictional ivy league school dealing with fictional (but realistic) events. Like it or not, race is a very prominent issue, especially in the circles of higher education, and the more liberal/elite schools in particular. The fact that a show chooses that for a setting and a topic shouldn&#39;t be so offensive imo. Lots of shows have dumber premises. </p>

<p>Many people who have not seen the show like to quote Sam (the girl who hosts the talk show) since she is prominent in the trailer, and they are under the impression that she represents the message of the show rather than just that character&#39;s views. She is a character with plenty of flaws, and throughout the show she is presented as a controversial character, even among the other black students (many of whom criticize her for being inflammatory, reverse-racist etc). If I had one thing to praise the show on, it is that they do a good job of demonstrating the complexities of these issues and representing different opinions on the subject. Each episode is focused on a different character, and you get all sorts of views/perspectives on the specific race-controversies in the show, and race-issues in general. Pretty much every one of those perspectives is given a fair representation and is sympathetically portrayed. Even the people who do the racist stuff (black face party mentioned in the trailer and other stuff later on in the show) are  humanized, and their perspective is given screen time, which was something that even surprised me. </p>

<p>Anyway, my point is that the show isn&#39;t as black and white (pun not intended) as every critic who didn&#39;t watch the show has portrayed it to be. </p>

<p>To your broader point, I agree that TPTB want to oppress everyone, but that doesn&#39;t mean that specific groups/minorities can&#39;t have it worse off than others. Slavery was something that was very real and which had enormous economic and social institutions built around it. There are many tools of oppression still in place today which have evolved from those old, oppressive institutions, because our world today was not created in a vacuum, it was built from the world that existed in previous generations. Things like police violence are not manufactured propaganda, they actually happen and have been going on for decades (only recently became a popular topic of conversation again though). I just don&#39;t see why we can&#39;t talk about ways which we are <em>all</em> oppressed by TPTB, and at the same time, admit that some things also particularly target and effects others in unequal ways. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, at least you&#39;ve noticed it. Now if only we can get another 20 million blacks to see it also, we might get somewhere.</p>

<p>All this started with &quot;affirmative action&quot; which was unjust. Yes, unjust, because it disadvantaged whites unfairly and deliberately favored blacks <em>under the law</em>. Now blacks (you&#39;re an exception) feel untouchable and above criticism in America. They are a protected, privileged class based on race. This is unhealthy. Before affirmative action all men were equal <em>under the law</em> and had equal opportunity. That&#39;s the only fair and just way to do things.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know what divide and conquer is. I know how ingrained it is in americas society. But doesn&#39;t it make more sense that it&#39;s simply profitable and feasible right now to make movies that talk about these issues? Because this is a new trend exactly because people have a different view on this compared to a decade or longer ago. You&#39;re bringing this as if it is an undebatable fact instead of an idea.</p>

<p>You know what would help? If people acknowledged the facts portrayed in these movies and act on it by avoiding to repeat this history. Instead you blame the people this history effected? So it&#39;s the fault of the people acknowledging this history and not the fault of people that ignore this history? </p>

<p>It&#39;s a perversion of the meaning and sentiment of the book to say he sold out his race. This is why the Left is so disgusting. They take what should be an iconic positive role model for black people and turn it into the worst possible insult. Then they poison the water with Jay Z and Beyonce/BLM type victimhood bullshit. It&#39;s sickening. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve read the book. I love the book. I love the character of Uncle Tom. I&#39;m saying that the generally accepted definition of an &quot;Uncle Tom&quot; is a minority that works against their own interests. Your counter to that seems to be that that isn&#39;t what the character in the book was like, and I <em>agree</em>, but that doesn&#39;t change what the definition is. It&#39;s like someone arguing that the word &quot;gay&quot; shouldn&#39;t mean &quot;homosexual&quot;. Whether it should or not, it <em>does</em>. I was asking what a better word might be for a minority that works against their own interests, because clearly we agree that &quot;Uncle Tom&quot; shouldn&#39;t be it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The loyalty is to the constitution.
People upholding that oath is what keeps you currently from slipping into tyranny.
But let us for the sake of argument say you don&#39;t like oaths or loyalty and are given the chance to rewrite those parts of the constitution you disagree with.
Which paragraphs would you rewrite?</p>
