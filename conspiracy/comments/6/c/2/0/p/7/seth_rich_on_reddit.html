    <div class="md"><p>Anyone who cares about Michael Flynn refusing a subpoena while simultaneously being okay with Combetta actively obstructing an investigation by &quot;oh shit&quot; deleting all that (his second oh shit moment after he testified that he knowingly deleted Hillary&#39;s server while it was subpoena&#39;d) is a partisan shitbird, and vice versa. </p>

<p>He had fucking reddit posts literally asking how to doctor (and then delete) files on his exchange server, indicating that not only did he perjure himself when he stated he agreed on his own/never sought advice on how to do it, but also his deletions were premeditated.</p>

<p>This is the guy who, literally, was on the phone with Cheryl Mills and Heather Samuelson (who <em>both</em> got immunity) the <em>day before</em> wiping the server, and they&#39;re all claiming attorney-client confidentiality for the call (citing that Hillary was the client even though CM and HS weren&#39;t operating in roles as her attorney, and that Combetta was merely servicing the call as a technician). Yup, nothing fishy at all about Hillary&#39;s server investigation, yup...</p>

<p>&quot;<a href="/u/ahmanrg30">/u/ahmanrg30</a> You are my favorite player, and I&#39;m pretty sure you&#39;re the reason I&#39;m a packers fan. I went to Central High, but I was a bit too young to remember watching you play there (though I was definitely at some of your games). I vividly remember watching you play in Memorial stadium and that &#39;97 season is when I fell in love with football. I was in school at Creighton when you were with the Nighthawks and got to see one of the teams wins before I moved away from Nebraska. I often get a lot of grief when people ask how I can be a packers fan without being from Wisconsin, but I always try to tell them about how I grew up watching you play and that it just seemed natural to keep cheering for you. I&#39;ve always looked up to you and the way you carried yourself off the field and consider you one of the shining examples of what football should like. Thank you for being an amazing man whom I&#39;ve had the honor of cheering on.
Since I&#39;m supposed to ask you a question, what do you think of the different fan bases you&#39;ve had behind you? Were they similar? Nebraska and Wisconsin fans have similar reputations for being die hard and always having high expectations. Though the nighthawks didn&#39;t really get off the ground, they sold out every game and seemed to have immediate buy in. If you had to pick one to have behind you, which would it be and what does it mean to have that?&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My experience is that the people who are most angry about the shady shit that was revealed in the leaks are people who have/have had some sort of emotional investment in the Democratic party, because there is also that feeling of betrayal there. <em>Especially</em> for people who have put their time and labor into the party. It&#39;s simplistic to think of the leaks as against the party; they were more properly against dishonesty, collusion, and political sleaze.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That post makes some crazy leaps of logic, how does his post of &quot;super editorialized post title&quot; mean he knows more than the story, which means he was the one who did it? He would obviously know about it because he works at the DNC, and if you look at the comment he was replying to, it was laying out why the &quot;summons&quot; was no big deal, and he was agreeing with it.</p>

<p>And there seems to be 0 connection to the &quot;pandas4bernie&quot; account, its asinine to say they &quot;posted around the same time&quot; when the panda account&#39;s few posts were just during the election season.</p>

<p>Social media of people who have died is always so uncomfortable. Even when it&#39;s friends of mine who have died, it somehow feels invasive reading them. And almost an affront that the profiles outlive them, especially when it&#39;s someone young. Maybe it&#39;s just me.</p>

<p>I&#39;m so glad and grateful that people tracked the account down and are doing this research, but damn, just so sad.</p>
