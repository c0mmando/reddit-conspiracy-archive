<p>We discuss so much beyond politics that paints a grim picture of politics in general and for all of history.  There is a lot of information in this subreddit that can conform to may different biases.  </p>

<p>Use the information to break your ego and discuss dissonance respectively and constructively. </p>

<p>This is the formula for amassing a much larger group of people that analyze facts and learn from each other through articulated reasoning and discussion. </p>

<p>The culture here is infectious and nobody is afraid to believe or support anything and we grow in every direction as a result. </p>

<p>Try to show absolutely no hate.  Find truth in every topic and cross check until you see larger and decentralized connections.  We are here to investigate and share in open source style.  This bonds everyone here. </p>

<p>Thank you for being interested in what other &quot;outsiders&quot; have to say about anything.  It humbles everyone to experience other people&#39;s perspectives.</p>

<p>Please also refrain from liberal name calling and pandering to right leaning users.  We want everyone&#39;s opinion in here so we can find the best information to judge the fairy tale of a culture we&#39;re being fed. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I take it you haven&#39;t seen any attempts at discussion with t_d people? It doesn&#39;t go the way you&#39;re describing. In fact, in their sub if you disagreed with anything or said anything to counter their view of things, odds are you got banned. I got banned for calling people out that were more pissed off a guy was a democrat than a pedophile. It&#39;s like trying to say anything negative of a dem right now in r/politics. They just do olympic gold medal winning mental gymnastics to continue thinking exactly how they do and nothing is gained except a headache and a loss of hope for humanity. There&#39;s no real discussion. It&#39;s their opinions are fact, and anything you say can be rationalized by them. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I used to post a fair bit in their sub. I&#39;m not really conservative but no one ever crucified me for trying to have a conversation. I never really directly argued against anything there. I&#39;m not disagreeing with you either, I think TD is almost as ignorant and close-minded as r/politics. However, I think that if you&#39;re going to try to unite people of various beliefs against the thing they should be fighting together, the best way to unite them isn&#39;t to push them away but to find a middle ground. At the very least, expose them to your beliefs  and maybe learn something about theirs.  </p>

<p>Because you were the only ones gaming and abusing the system that was in place. Jesus stop acting like such snowflakes because they didn&#39;t let you shit up all of reddit. Stop trying to abuse the Karma system and botting and there won&#39;t be new rules. Jesus not that hard.</p>

<p>They don&#39;t care about conspiracies (unless about hillary). They care about using any sub/person they can to prop trump up. I don&#39;t think they will like it here where some people question the master they have pledged their lives to.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe they&#39;ll start to see it for what it is in general and why it is pumped on tv so hard from either side; ITS A CHARADE as they carry out what we&#39;ll find out about in three years or so etc.  </p>

<p>It&#39;s an ongoing cycle and it takes discipline to calm down to even see it from a bigger world view that paints a pretty vivid picture of our colonialism despite R or D.  </p>

<p>It&#39;s big business putting on a show while they do whatever they want and pretend there are still laws for all of us because they own the systems that enforce them.  </p>

<p>It&#39;s a game and either we all wake up and civilly figure it out or we argue about blue or red.  Black or white.  Rich or poor.  Me or you.  </p>

<p>It&#39;s important to note that they have been dealing with a great deal of personality cultism surrounding Trump and that needs to be weakened. I don&#39;t care if Trump supporters come here and contribute to discussion, but until their undying loyalty can be broken, I don&#39;t think many of them will be able to contribute in a constructive manner. </p>
