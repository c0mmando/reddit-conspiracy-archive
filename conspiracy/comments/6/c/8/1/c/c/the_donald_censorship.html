       Everyone might not like each other or agree but we all have the right to exist and have our opinions. If antiTrump subs exist and the same rules aren't enforced on them that is fucking bullshit. It might be TD today but someday if we allow this censorship to exist it might be you tomorrow. This isn't an issue for just TD this is an issue that effects everyone. This is not ok. If we allow this we are going down a very dark road and I don't know if there will be a way back.

       This stand had to be made on the day the sub was crowdsourcing things on Seth Rich?
      </p>
      <p>
       And didn't the mod team get an overhaul after the election and the ones that got the boot yesterday were a handful of the original mods?

       Oh yes it's definitely weird. The Seth Rich case was catching fire. Yeah the ones that were booted were beloved original mods. That's why this is not ok. I have no clue why they made it private. Is this TD rise up? Or were they forced to go private? I'm saying we can't let them force us to be censored

        Seth Rich's parents comment on son's death
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <pre><code>      &gt;OMAHA, Neb. (WOWT) - Our sister station WOWT reached out to the family of slain DNC staff member Seth Rich in the wake of increasing speculation as to the cause of his death.
</code></pre>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Twenty-seven-year-old Seth Conrad Rich, an Omaha native, was shot multiple times in Washington D.C. July 10. No arrests have been made in the case.
       </p>
       <p>
        Recently a private investigator looking into the murder on behalf of the Rich family claimed that Seth had been in correspondence with Wikileaks, which may be tied to Seth's murder.
       </p>
       <p>
        Seth's family refutes the claims in their statement.
"As we've seen through the past year of unsubstantiated claims, we see no facts, we have seen no evidence, we have been approached with no emails and only learned about this when contacted by the press." Said the Rich Family
The Rich family added that there would have to be substantial evidence to convince them, which they have yet to see.
       </p>
       <p>
        "Even if tomorrow, an email was found, it is not a high enough bar of evidence to prove any interactions as emails can be altered and we've seen that those interested in pushing conspiracies will stop at nothing to do so. We are a family who is committed to facts, not fake evidence that surfaces every few months to fill the void and distract law enforcement and the general public from finding Seth's murderers."
The Rich's said that the private investigator who spoke to the press was offered to the Rich family and paid for by a third party, and contractually was barred from speaking to the press or anyone outside of law enforcement or the family unless explicitly authorized by the family.
Police believe that the murder happened during a robbery attempt.

       Kinda funny how the parents of a unsolved murder case are so quick to say stop digging for answers. I mean they don't have a clue what happened to him but apparently don't want any help finding out what exactly occurred that night...

        What about Seth's parents saying they want this 'discussion' to end?

       Look.. I don't know if they genuinely think it was a random guy off the street that killed him or not. That might totally be the case, and they
       <em>
        aren't
       </em>
       being told what to say by PR people.
      </p>
      <p>
       But.. This is a conspiracy sub and it's absolutely possible they
       <em>
        are
       </em>
       being told to tell people on the internet to stop looking into it, especially since there are things that absolutely seem suspicious to a lot of people here.
      </p>
      <p>
       I get that it's their wish and I even kind of see where they're coming from
       <em>
        in a way
       </em>
       , but unless they actually know 100% who killed him how can they possibly know who it was and why they did it?
      </p>
      <p>
       Regardless, whether they think it was a robbery or whether they think it was an assassination, does
       <em>
        anyone
       </em>
       , parents or not, have any kind of right to tell internet users to just stop talking about it?
      </p>
      <p>
       Say JFK was killed recently instead of when he was. If his relatives said "hey guys, it was a lone shooter who was just crazy, please stop speculating!" does that mean we should actually stop thinking it was someone else with a different motive because they asked?

       No but then there's people(the donald subscribers) who have completely politicized the issue and use it as an excuse to deflect from what Trump's antics(firing Comey which the sub tried to distract from by filling the front page with Seth Rich posts).

       You are right, this Seth Rich stuff does need discussion but we need to discuss all types of conspiracies and not just this one.

       Admin censorship and favoritism is my beef, not sub rules. Subs can have whatever rules they like and if I don't like it I won't go there. Rules are needed for subs to function. I can 100% guarantee that if this sub got invade by bronies posting pony porn 24/7 you wouldn't be ok with it.

       It's called the bastion of free speech on reddit due to fighting for equal treatment from admins on reddit, which by the way benefits the whole of reddit.

       You honestly don't see the difference at all between each individual sub having their own rules that they're allowed to enforce any way they wish (science will remove unsourced comments, some tv show subs will remove people who go there to post about how shitty that tv show is, etc) and reddit the website creating special rules for
       <em>
        one specific
       </em>
       subreddit?
      </p>
      <p>
       The point of t_d was for supporters of him to gather, shit post to their hearts content and use the sub as one giant rally and everyone knew that. It was in their sidebar and rules. There was an entirely separate sub for
       <em>
        anything else
       </em>
       related to Trump.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why are they not allowed to complain about censorship? Because they enforce their rules? Even here if someone makes a post about another sub censoring them, no one gives a shit and will point it out if the post they're complaining about broke that subreddits rules. So how is it censorship for t_d to enforce
       <em>
        their
       </em>
       rules?
      </p>
      <p>
       If this sub was given special rules to abide by, that no other sub needed to follow, would we not be allowed to complain because we ban people who come here only to hate on conspiracy theories?
      </p>
      <p>
       That's really all besides the point anyway. No sub, whether they "censor" anyone or not, should be made to follow a special set of rules that no other sub has to.
       <em>
        Especially
       </em>
       considering there are other subs that censor and brigade, yet they have the same rules we all do.
      </p>
      <p>
       People can keep saying "it's a private website!!!!"
       <em>
        all
       </em>
       they want, but I know that most of the people saying this would not be saying that if this private website singled out a Hillary sub, an Islamic, Muslim or Jewish sub. Pretty much anything except Trump related shit.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's been a few times everybody got pissed over censorship or a deleted sub, and those subs were waaay fucking worse than a 24/7 President rally. Multiple subs went private and tons of people, liberals and conservatives threatened to or did leave. Now we see shit like all the default mods literally
       <em>
        begging
       </em>
       the admins in chat to straight up delete t_d just cause they don't like Trump or the sub.

       So the mods of a subreddit can decide what content they want to see but the admins of reddit can not?

       Why is that exactly? Because you feel it should be like that or do you hace an actual objective reason for your opinion?

       Crowdsourcing things on Seth Rich went into full blown witch hunt and doxxing more than once. All you Internet sleuths are going to accomplish is to mess up innocent people's lives. Who knows, maybe Rich was the leaker and got killed over it - his death was certainly suspicious. This is not the way to address it.

       It went full blown, "it's going to become very clear Seth Rich was the Wikileaks source." This would lead to the Russia narrative taking a hit, and adding a ton of credibility to him being murdered by the DNC.

       Sad or not, most people don't care much about Rich. The only reason T_d is on the warpath is to offer up a counterpoint to all the negative press about Trump. Guess who won the election? Clinton is largely irrelevant now. The country and the world are moving on.

       Yea that is literally nothing. The proof that its his account is weak at best. and him being anti-Hillary does not prove he leaked ffs. No shit. No one liked Hillary. Doesn't mean someone is going to endanger their job because of it.

       You have no right to a forum on a privately own site where you can say whatever you want. The owners don't like how the users of that forum behaved or talked and they tried to handle it without totally shutting it down.

       If they have rules they should enforce it on other subs too. The issue is we are being unfairly censored. Do we have fucktards that deserve to be censored yes but so does every sub.

       And there's the real rub.  Reddit imposes the rules different on T_D in a way that impacts all subs, because the sitewide "no brigading/doxxing/harassing" rule is actually "no brigading/doxxing/harassing unless it's against T_D".  That affects the entire character of the rule and diminishes the integrity of the site.  If you know about this and are being sufficiently honest about yourself, you can't
       <em>
        only
       </em>
       say "those damn T_D Trumptards are ruining the site for everyone", because now you have to live with the reality that a site you might have cared about for years before you even cared about politics now openly caters to the anti-Trump narrative and all the sorts of communities that ally with that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Plus--and I hope the irony here isn't lost on anyone--this feeds right into the anti-leftist reactionary movement (which you see in Youtube/minds.com skeptics and parts of Kekistan) when it claims that the ones screaming loudest about oppression are doing quite a lot of it themselves.  But as Jordan Peterson would put it, the leftists don't give a fuck about anything their opposition could say in the past, present, or future because their aim is not to win over society but to utterly destroy its foundations.

       It was a "rules for thee, not for me" situation. SO many other subs did not have to follow the same rules. T_D was just supposed to "shut up and take it"?
      </p>
      <p>
       Did you see the PMs the mods were posting, of people messaging them their dox, threatening to rape them, asking them if their mom liked their cum, asking them if their wife was back from fucking that black dude, etc etc etc. Did you also see the screenshots of the month old messages to the admins, with no response?
      </p>
      <p>
       The mods were just supposed to shut up and take that? So not only were they getting special rules imposed on
       <em>
        just
       </em>
       them, they were also the active victim of the very thing reddit was claiming to try and stop, all while ignored that they were victims.
      </p>
      <p>
       But, you know, it's totally the T_D moderators who are at fault here.

       The admins felt their actions were negatively effecting the rest of their site. It's probably not fair but it doesn't have to be. Again you have no right to a forum run exactly how you want on someone else's site.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you ran Reddit would you put up with a sub constantly calling you a bitch/failure, telling you to fuck yourself, harassing other users, and spewing hatred towards just about everyone but themselves?

       We already know Trump was acquainted with Epstein. I actually have a theory Trump had a suspicion of a ring and was trying to investigate it through Epstein.

       This doesn't really prove Trump raped any kids. I'm guessing Epstein figured out Trump was investigating him and tried to throw suspicion on Trump.

       Calling any information that challenges your opinion "propaganda" doesn't really do you any service. It's a fact, and a few people have posted screenshots confirming this information as well. I remember seeing one particular post on their front page that had "
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics
       </a>
       " in it 5 or 6 times, and there were dozens of headlines that said "fuck

       Let's clarify a few things.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hotlinking to r/politics in r/the_donald is the exact rule. Including it in titles is not banned.
      </p>
      <p>
       Saying "fuck u/spez he's a cuck and a cannibal" is not banned either.

       It's not banned, but a concerted effort at brigading, attacking another subreddit, and harassing specific users certainly is banned. And the threads that mentioned it in the title were threads specifically targeting and hotlinking to
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       The removal of the mods by reddit was 100% justified, and I'm surprised it took as long as it did. In recent days, concerted harassment directed at
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics
       </a>
       was dramatically increasing, and that's a fact. Not "propaganda."

       If those exist, the mods of those subs should be removed as well.

       You can't say anything that goes against the MAGA narrative there. I got banned for simply posting that Trump should stop validating all the fake news from the NYT and Wapo a day after his team denies them. That sub censors more than any other place I've seen on reddit. I'm actually still wondering if it hasn't just been satire (ala The Colbert Report) this whole time and the mods are all in on the joke. It's just sad if it's not.

       While I agree they can be childish and... interesting... their rules are their rules. Maybe you have gotten banned for some stuff. A lot of conservative subs hand out bans like candy. It's still not fair for a sub to have different rules than

       It's an individual community. They can set the rule that no one can talk about water balloons if they want. It's not fair for Reddit to impose
       <em>
        different
       </em>
       rules for one community out of hundreds of thousands just because they don't like their narrative though. If you don't like t_d's narrative you don't have to go there.

       You clearly do care, and free speech doesn't exist in a privately owned business. This isn't a government funded website, they have zero obligation to provide you with a platform. They could remove every single subreddit except for awe and that would be 1000% ok and legal.

       I said I think it's "unfair" that they clearly treated a community differently because of their narrative. If they continue to do this they will end up at this sub and I will find a different website. No big deal. I can disagree with the actions of a company and not be in tears about it.

       To the extent that Google is functionally unavoidable, we can say that Google is in a different class than reddit. Perhaps you can argue that when a certain web based company becomes so entwined with so many parts of the internet that it's closer to a public good than a private space, but that simply wouldn't hold true for reddit.

       Reddit serves as an online bar.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bars simply ban the undesirables once they've acted out, hate speech, illegal content etc. They don't ban entire groups for the actions of a few.
      </p>
      <p>
       Reddit is hurting multi hundred thousand user communities because of the actions of a few that could be false flag attacks, as is what happened with pg. The bar equivalent would be banning all Jews.

       No, for so many reasons.
      </p>
      <p>
       For starters, no group of people have been banned or censored at all, only a particular kind of activity.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you really want to use Jews and bars as your metaphor, it would be more like banning circumcisions from happening inside the bar.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is a vast a meaningful difference between private companies discriminating against people and having a say in what activities can take place on their property.

       I'll concede this to make a different point.
      </p>
      <p>
       Reddit inc has been treating td differently than other subs that do the same shit.
      </p>
      <p>
       R/politics discord regularly brigades and trolls
      </p>
      <p>
       The Trump hate subs are not filtered from the front page but to is
      </p>
      <p>
       SRS and family raid, dox, blackmail, and hijack everything they don't like
      </p>
      <p>
       I've never heard of any sub having a banned user unbanned by an admin after doxxing except pg.
      </p>
      <p>
       Td is the only sub known to have users comments anonymously edited by the fucking CEO of reddit. Obligatory fuck u/spez
      </p>
      <p>
       Share blue, antifa, ctr, etc run rampant over r/politics but td gets in trouble for proving it
      </p>
      <p>
       Td is the only sub banned from linking to another sub
      </p>
      <p>
       People literally about killing the president
      </p>
      <p>
       Blatant racism and sexism against straight or white people, and legal American citizens.
      </p>
      <p>
       Need I continue?
      </p>
      <p>
       Inb4 td did this to themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       Every example of wrongdoing by TD has been and is currently ongoing within other subs yet td is the only one punished.

       The overarching point though is that even if we were to agree that reddit's administration were unfair and inconsistent then again the comparison to a bar would be one which kicks out some people for being unruly but gives their friends more leeway.

       I conceded that. You made a great refutation. I'd also add that reddit has an obligation to remain unbiased and fair to all their users without regard to any circumstance. It's okay for a bar to slide a free drink occasionally. It's not okay for a company to silence their users especially for political reasons whether perceived or actual.

       Am i not allowed to criticize the corrupt dipshits running this slowly dying site?
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not owed anything. Nor am I suggesting as much. I'm challenging them to justify their actions. To be accountable to their word. To act like fucking adults for a little while while they're in the spotlight. To be forthright, communicative, accessible, responsible, fair, and ethical human beings. Apparently that's difficult for people making fat stacks of money.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have every right to state to my opinion, they have every right to censor me on their site. Censored users have every right to try them in the court of public opinion. Which is what we're doing here. Which is what will continue until reddit gives up, dies, or is replaced.

       While I agree with you t_d is ridiculous r/politics bans anyone and everyone who disagrees or posts with a dissenting opinion and the admins do nothing. There are subreddits for people to express their "urges" to commit pedophilia. The amount of censorship of anti or even non-pro Democratic viewpoints is ridiculous. The admins are basically preserving the right to free speech of pedophiles before those with dissenting political opinions. T_d may be full of looneys but name one sub that doesn't have their own. The fact that the admins are stepping in just further proves to me that reddit is bought and paid for by the leftist establishment in an attempt to further control what is displayed to reddit users. Echoing other sentiments it's scary to me because you used to be able to have an enlightened political discussion on r/pol and then the mods came and censored everything. Now I fear the same will come of this sub leaving only the wacknut conspiracies like the flat earth theory and those who disagree will be banned. So instead of actually having members who can refute the earth being flat only those who think the earth is flat and then this sub becomes a hive mind like all the rest of the generic vanilla mod controlled subs. I appreciate and learn from the diversity of opinion on this sub and fear this latest show of disregard for open discourse is a dangerous step to the development of another sub with a controlled agenda.

       This is a flat out lie perpetuated by users of T_D to justify their censorship. It's projection and nothing more. If you follow the rules, (like not calling people shills), no one will ban you for having a conservative ideology in

       Evidence of absence much? You can't prove a negative. In the past, I have called out users claiming they were banned from that sub, but when I looked at their history, they had post after post of calling people CRT shills, a clear violation of the rules.

       Bullshit. Politics was 'hillaryclinton2' during the election and modded aggressively to enforce that. When was the last time there was a big positive thread about Trump in politics? or an anti-clinton/democrats thread?
 It hasn't happened since months before the election, before CTR took over as mods. I was banned for basically no good reason there. I was banned from T_D too unjustly, but one is a private community dedicated to 1 person, another is a default sub, they shouldn't be acting the same way.

       T_D is a rally community. Only positive stuff is allowed. We have the rest of Reddit and msm for the constant negative stuff. It is definitely not satire. It's a happy place for POTUS supporters. We are usually the first to break any Trump related stories. We are constantly being brigated by shareblue so while your comment/criticism might be genuine, it falls into the "concern trolling" arena. This is a tactic that shareblue likes to use to steer the narrative. If you have a question, r/ask the Donald is better for that kind of discussion.

       In what ways? Serious question, I'm not trying to start any drama.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've heard about reddit admins being lax about enforcing spam/brigading rules on the_donald but I'm sadly unaware of any other examples. Probably because I go out of my way to find controversial shit on this site and I'm not too easily offended.

       It's impossible to have a valid discussion on anything. A while ago there was a thread on
       <a href="/r/getMotivated">
        /r/getMotivated
       </a>
       with a picture of Morgan Freeman telling Don Lemon how black people can succeed despite historical oppression. This sparked conversation, with one side saying they could and the other saying they couldn't. It was a civil discussion with some very good points being brought up on both sides. I saw no racism whatsoever. Then the mods locked it because of 'controversy and racism'.

       So first you talk about admins and then about mods? You realise those are two different things.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is a rule of
       <a href="/r/getmotivated">

       </a>
      </p>

      <p>
       I can see how something not racist civil discussion could still easily break this rule.

       Indeed. A sign o' the times, imo, although I'm far from unpacking what it all means and points towards. The 'explanations' offered on either side - cultural Marxism, no platform for hate etc - are all reductive, superficial and useless.

       .  They have changed the algorithm so many times then eventually removed it from being seen entirely.  Keep in mind this is a website that had a sub called Jailbait for years.
       <a href="/r/politics">

        /r/democrats
       </a>
       .  Worldnews, news, very rarely to you get anything other than stories with liberal agendas to the top.  The entire website pushes this republicans are climate change/science deniers agenda but try mentioning the fact that democrats are owned by big oil as well.  Climate change is the hardest politicized topic to unravel.  Yes humans have an impact but science created this problem by prolonging life combined with the development of tech that burns fossil fuels — science also does not have a cost effective alternative to burning fossil fuels yet &amp; until that happens we will keep doing what we do unless we go back to living like cavemen.  You do not see rational none biased discussions on the defaults or larger subs on the site.  All you get is "republicans are trying to drive us off the cliff quicker" when the truth is both sides are guilty &amp; we dont have good alternatives yet.

       Totally wrong.  Solar and wind cost the same or less than fossil fuels.  Building solar and wind farms would create a ton of jobs.  The reason we dont is republicans being owned by big oil.  Thanks for helping perpetuate conservative lies though.

       Wow.  Congrats on being a stereotypical idiot republican.  Let me see if I can explain it in terms simple enough for your uneducated flyover ass.  See, these new fangled solar and weend there type generators, well they prodeuce a thang called lectracity.  That thur lectracity can be used to run all sorts of fun things like cars n boats n planes.  Hell, it can even be used to charge the battery your wife uses in her dildo to actually get pleasure.
      </p>
      <p>
       So by usin them there liberal energy sources we have an endless supply of lectracity unlike that crude black gold you conservative type cunts seem to be so fond of ripping out of the only planet we got to live on.

       no one shits on safe spaces for marginalised people. sports subreddits are all safe spaces for their own fanbases. people shit on safe spaces in neutral, public places that are supposed to encourage discussion and critical thinking like universities, public platforms, etc.

       That's not true. I checked into it quite often. It was mostly postings about news articles and such. The kinds of things ignored by the legacy media all the time. And it was positive, too. They were very supportive about finding the people who murdered Seth Rich. In fact, I was a little surprised that I didn't see liberals asking for an investigation as often, as he was a Democrat. I've been puzzled by that. He was young and his life was stolen from him.

       You would think the Democrats and the Bernie Bros would want to know who killed him since he was one of them? Julian Assange very strongly hinted that he was the leaker and offered a reward to help find his killed. You don't have to be a brain surgeon to know what that means. There are a lot of unanswered questions such as why didn't the DNC let the FBI examine their servers? Recently we found Seth Rich's twitter and Reddit accounts. His posts show that he was a huge Bernie supporter and hated Hillary. There is a lot of information there that points to motive. Right now the DNC is arguing in court that it has no obligation to be objective and it can rig the primaries in the favor of whoever they want.

       Yeah,  looks like you never actually spent any time at all on T_D if you think it was just hating on other people. It WAS a huge echo chamber (notice the past tense) of Trump supporters but all of the haters got the boot pretty quickly. The only thing we were hating on was political corruption, radical terrorists, SJWS and
       <a href="/u/spez">
        /u/spez
       </a>
       . Mostly links and commentary on all things Trump and lots of memes. It was a pleasant break from all of the constant Trump hate on the rest of reddit

       It's a community for discussing positive things about Trump and memes. It would be weird to go to r/trees and talk about how much you hate weed and alcohol is better. You would be downvoted and probably banned if you did it multiple times

       I mean we were always open to discussion on politics and I had multiple people say they got banned for saying things that I myself said. So maybe it was the way you said it. I don't know I'm not a mod mostly a lurker. Anyways it doesn't matter much anymore considering the sub is Kia

       It was definitely not open to any politics discussion. Any criticism of posts on there was and is an instant ban.
      </p>
      <p>
       My first comment there was simply pointing out a logical fallacy(it was a really basic logic error many people make, no biggy just wanted to clear it up, back then I wasn't opposed to that sub as much), got banned within 20 minutes.

       I don't think that's at all what the argument against safe spaces was about. It was about co-opting universities into becoming a place that vets ideas for being of the 'right' opinion before being allowed to be expressed - in the name of 'safety'

       no its controlled . you can tell it was shilled and I'm not saying I knew something was gonna happen but it was clear there was a cold war between the reddit website and the donald... so basically itself because reddit admins took over the donald right after the election.

       The leftists take over subs that have the appearance of being neutral like

       which refuses to allow direct links from Wikileaks or self titles.  You have to copy paste post titles from the website you are linking.  You can share your opinion - you have to regurgitate what some journalist wrote.

       99% of the subs on reddit are. if the mods don't actively censor you the users tend to with the karma system which hides dissenting opinion and also discourages people from going against the tide.

       no, that would be most of reddit. People who were pro-Trump were banned form most of the default subs during the election, and corralled into T_D. How is it a safe space when you force people to stay in one community and ban anyone speaking against the jerk in the default subs?

       What an interesting way to say safe space for snowflakes who cant stand the very idea of someone having a different opinion than them. You have to make up a boogieman to justify the fact that T_D is worse than the WORST of the subs T_D hates.

       We never hurt anyone. The God Emperor thing is a joke. Reddit is full of nasty people like you though who wish I'll upon others and want the country to fail because of your irrational hate for Donald Trump. Very toxic.

       T_D bans and censors people for minor reasons.  They have an ongoing ban now on anything longtime Trump supporter, Paul Joseph Watson posts.   Why?  He strongly disagreed with the Syrian bomb strike.  Many people felt the same.
      </p>
      <p>
       Question why the US puts Israels interests ahead of its own? Your posts are removed and you risk a ban.  Any critical discussion of Ivanka and Jerad is usually removed as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       Being critical when Trump goes off course actually helps him!  He got elected vowing in part to put America first, get out of endless wars and crush the establishment.  To hell with political correctness.  His team should know how the people who helped get him elected feel.  He is surrounded largely by vultures now.  Trump has excellent instincts but the people around him have very different interests than the people who got him elected.

       I was a big time r/the_donald poster and I 100% agree with you on above. I'm sorry you got banned.
      </p>
      <p>
       I posted dissent in the "domreddit", but I always tried to make sure it had a positive solution based spin on it. constructive criticism. It's mostly cause the media bias was so hateful, I believe the mods wanted the sub to be a positive sanctuary from the daily hate.
      </p>
      <p>
       After the election I moved to pol and twitter more bc trump started having serious issues with the swamp, I have heard/thought of a number of theories of what's going on - but I was having trouble keeping up with the constructive criticism "positive tone". That's why I took a break from the sub. I got banned on twitter and came back to the Donald during Seth Rich, then boom - the sub's censored. The normalization process makes me feel like the gulags are that much closer.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sorry for the rant - just a lil buzzed and I hoped to convey not everyone on the sub was the caricature of a Red hat wearing super bro.

       Because its a subreddit for Trump supporters, try saying anything pro-Trump at ETS, esist, MarchAgainstTrump, etc and see how fast you get banned. Why aren't you holding them to the same standard?
      </p>
      <p>
       Its a much greater offense that basic subs like Politics, News, etc are one sided anti-Trump echo chambers, it didn't used to be like that. CTR took Politics over before the election and banned most people critical of Hillary, and its been a anti-Trump circlejerk ever since.

       I've yet to be banned for criticizing Trump in TD. You don't have to be 100% positive all of the time. Maybe a mod mistook you for a concern troll. It doesn't sound as if you tried to fight it.

       T_D is like a massive MAGA train. They make it clear they don't deal with concern trolling or negativity. It's all hype all the time. When it comes back if you message the mods I'm sure they can look at your post history and make a decision. Typically it isn't a one off and they look at previous posts to see if it's a pattern. Not defending them for banning you so please don't take it that way, just explaining what their thought process likely was.

       You must be talking about the brick bot and train bot. Free coat bot also. So yeah there technically are bots on there. But they clearly identify as bots and everyone loves them and loves activating them. They do not, however, have repetitive shill comment bots like you see elsewhere.

       I'm a member of T_D for more than a year and I don't recall threads telling people to brigade. There were memes about
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics

       , yeah, but brigading was always disallowed, and encouraging brigading could get you banned. Maybe I don't remember correctly, though.

       You're probably right. It's hard to contain a large community like that, and there are always idiots. But there was always a rule against both brigading and doxxing. There has been doxxing and brigading on both sides, and r/politics frequently linked to T_D in the same way T_D did to r/politics.

      <p>
       Admins told specific subreddits(mostly anti and pro donald subreddits) to not link to each other, this was a rule imposed on ALL of them. If you weren't allowed to reference politics in the D then you weren't allowed to do it the other way round either, the left subreddits had the literally same rules applied.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now obviously you will see users on both sides breaking the rules, that's always going to happen and only some of it will be removed. But on the D the mods themselves broke rules, that did not happen on other subs.

       This kind of action makes the supporters of 'the donald' feel very justified in their actions and beliefs. That's the reason it was done, to drive them further towards extremism. Now these folks definitely feel they are onto something. You'll see that old 'Voltaire' misquote regurgitated about 'those who cannot be criticized' and that kind of thing a lot. I think many are  getting played in that 5d chess game so many td'ers fancy. It's ironic and at a certain level, mockery. You'll also see things done to 'the other side' to also further extremism. (different things, so each group can make themselves out to be more unfairly represented, which in itself also furthers divide. It's going to be quite a summer.

       I said I think it's a good thing that the Donald will be private I hope they stay private actually it means I can have a forum where I can talk and no one that is against Trump can actually go there. The anti Donald subs or only have content anymore because message on people will be on the private the Donald. And then viola! Not as much political shit on the front page.

       Because they seem so obsessed with reddit. For example, if I didn't like Best Buy and I told all my friends Best Buy has the worst prices and the worst customer service and to not support them, but then I spend a lot of time browsing Best Buy, what does that make me?

       The difference, imo, is that Reddit use to be a unique social media platform where people could be reasonable to one another and see what the other side is saying. This site is "the front page of the internet" and censoring here cuts off any opportunity for people to break out of their echo chambers. You're argument is just a weak strawman. Comparing a website to Best Buy... really?

       Thousands of internet-savvy folks can surely band together and clone either one to continue venerating Dear Leader. I mean, look at the crowd sourcing that goes on when they thing they know something. You're telling me that those folks with a tone of enthusiasm can't band together to create a discussion board?

       anyone who doesn't parrot the official narrative to leave. It terrifies them that people are one click away from alternative communities like

       Well yea, every subreddit is not allowed to break the personal information rule or whatever it's called, I'm looking for more specific examples where another subreddit had been singled out (with rules specific for that community only) like the TD apparently has, because I can't think of any.

       Which is why this sub rarely, if ever, comes under threat of being banned. If the mods of this sub do nothing else, they surely enforce Reddit's rules. I've never seen this subreddit be threatened with a ban, despite it being bigger than other subreddits that have been banned with similar views.

       All of the above, and Voat is a cesspool right now. People that were already on Voat prior to the announcement of eventual migration their 2 days ago are telling newcomers to fuck off. They want Voat to be their exclusive club to spam "nigger" over and over again and are mad as hell that the_donald didn't decide to assimilate into their sub.
      </p>
      <p>
       Due to all of the above, I'm convinced Voat is comprised of edgy 14 year olds, shills payed to fuck over Voat and salty people banned from t_d on reddit. Mods need to do some serious banning over there.

       You call us useful idiots yet say oh no big deal if you're censored. Just move to another site. Well you weak souls can do that. However we choose to stay here and raise awareness until the end. Most of us are on voat already. It's a slippery slope boys. It might be us today but this will just be the start. When you're opinion isn't the popular one and you're shut down let's see how you like it. Living in a complete echo chamber won't be as great as you think.

       T_d repeatedly behaved badly. They wanted to dominate the front page and threw a hissy fit whenever their relatively small community was rebuffed by the greater part of Reddit. I don't begrudge them their sub or their own censorship. I do begrudge the trolling, whining, and drama that they perpetuate. A lot of the sub's behavior is trolling, and you can't just let it go unchecked without ruining things for everyone.

       Try posting two dissenting comments in the aforementioned subreddits and you'll experience anti-censorship. You're free to be smug and have your own opinions, but just wait till your community is censored. It's a great joy trust me.

       you can post whatever you want in politics so long as you arent a cock. That does not shield you from having your opinion judged without a safe space echo chamber to jerk you off though. Imagine if you all hadnt freaked out and locked yourself in a corner how you would actually be shaping conversations rather than being pushed out of them. But rather than participating in politics y'all decided you wanted to bounce your fake news off eachother all day, and now that thats gone EVERYONE ELSE CENSORS US

       Which may have even been tolerable, but nuh, T_D was constantly bitching that they werent being included in /All, they wanted to be shoved in everybodies face and then ban any responses to the threads they were slingshotting to the top of the board. Thats not just aggressive Censorship, its an insecure hugbox trying to project propaganda without anyone being able to talk back.

       Those subs don't really ban people though. People get downvoted to hell, but banning is a lot rarer. On the other hand, you can go to r/The_donald posts that literally have 70% of their comments deleted by the mods.

       When did you make that comment? Do you have a direct link ND screenshots to the ban? I went through ~3 pages of your history and there and no comments on the Politics sub. You have no posts or comments decrying the ban either. Was this further back in your post history?

       Do you know what censorship is? The Donald is to promote Trump not debate him so when your comment gets deleted for being irrelevant to within the rules then it's your own fault you get banned hence why the sub has another sub that will take any question or opinion being
       <a href="/r/asktrumpsupporters">
        /r/asktrumpsupporters
       </a>
       . Censorship is when you have to filter out from td reaching
       <a href="/r/all">
        /r/all
       </a>
       , hiding their subscriber count (300k subs and 25k online daily is unreal compare to other subs) and not only spez editing comments that are pro trump so tell me how does td censor anything?

       i ask myself that every day but I figure if I keep reminding you what censorship actually means youll eventually smarten up. in case you were having trouble:

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        the suppression or prohibition of any parts of books, films, news, etc. that are considered obscene, politically unacceptable, or a threat to security.

       I saw their work yesterday finding Seth Rich's reddit account, email accounts and various social media he used. No where else on the internet can people pull together and do those things withina week, let alonr the hours they took!

       They are an IMPRESSIVE set of individuals, who would scare the shit out of me, if I was hiding the truth behind the current antiquated political/legal system.

       I mean I enjoy a good political conspiracy as much as anyone lol it's just the straight up insanity that's taken over lately makes it impossible to have a discussion. It turns into name calling and accusations, then just implodes.

       Zack and Mack are the characters in two books available on Amazon.  They are listed as authors and as my pen name.  Currently they are ten feet away sitting in their tank.  Yeah...this household supported Trump.  We red-pilled so many people that The Donald could never imagine.  See...we are vendors at fairs.  We sell tie dye...Old Hippie dude with pony tail and all and when folks come up, its time to red-pill them.
      </p>
      <p>
       While I enjoyed perusing the topics at The_Donald, as far as I am concerned they are not the only place on the internet--having been a member of Free Republic since 2001 and lurked even earlier than that...That's still the number one place on the internet.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, Zack and Mack thank you for their support.  Check them out at Gab this evening  @zackandmack

       All they're doing is motivating a good number of TD members to get even more creative in declaring war on the corrupt admins of Reddit. I hope that other Reddit users outside TD will join the fight in the name of free speech.

       It's really dangerous how you took the medias brainwashing hook line and sinker and ran with it. Spend some time reading the actual content of the subreddit, understand what they're saying and unplug from your daily drip of CNN/BuzzFeed/HuffPost.

       No one can make you see the truth, because you just borough deeper into your own misguided convictions. You need to see it for yourself.

       They can believe their shit is cotton candy for all I care. Why are you so bothered by what other people think? Personally I think Trump supporters are a rapidly diminishing pool of retards, but I don't give two fucks if some other lamo wants to associate me with them. Care factor 0.

I'm a TD member. With the sub going private all of my comments/posts have also disappeared. Will they return should the sub become active again? Or should I be worried something's going on? Sorry if its a dumb question.

       Banned from theD for asking if it was a real sub.
      </p>
      <p>
       They were a hate sub for the most part, let's leave them alone.

       The adults can come here and behave like the rest of Reddit; sorted.

       Let's not pretend that theD leaving is an attack on free speech for all, because their existence was an attack on free speech.

      <p>
       Once again: I was banned for asking a question. There was no hate in the question. It simply did not conform with their ideals.

       The donald has been a gathering place for far right ideals and has promoted witch hunting and brigading. Every day you will see a post that claims that someone is anti trump and everyone should go after that person.

      <p>
       If anti trump subs start witch hunting and brigading then they too should get reprimanded. The donald has been asking for it for a long time and is overdue to getting shut down.

       I frequented the Donald pretty often and most times I saw comments calling for the end of Islam. Qurans burning images, racist stereotypes of the Middle East and then calling for another crusade. When td supporters get shit and then try and snuggle up to other sub reddits with puppy dog eyes I just laugh.

       I don't frequent this sub, but I did frequent both The_Donald and other Anti-Trump Subs in the past, and I want to clarify, even though I may be late to the matter here.
      </p>
      <p>
       When the rule rolled out to stop brigading (Certain subs aren't allowed to link to other subs, etc), it was in an Anti-Trump sub that I learned about it. They said that they were no longer allowed to directly link T
       <em>
        D. These rules _are
       </em>
       being enforced in other subs, T_D is just saying it's not to try to lend their rule breaking some credit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anti-Trump subs also tend to avoid doxxing and harassing people, instead sticking to just making a post laughing/calling out something stupid and staying with that. T_D goes above and beyond when it comes to fucking with people, and everyone's fed up with it.

       So then why is it ok when the_Donald censors and bans everyone but it's a problem when Reddit does it? I got banned from the_Donald for a comment that was deemed "low energy", don't support their hypocrisy, if they can censor free speech then Reddit can censor theirs.

       You can't punish one sub based off the actions of another sub simply because they have related topics.

       T_D was given those rules because of THEIR behavior.

      <p>
       They were using bots to spam r/all.

      <p>
       The other anti-trump subs were NOT doing this.
      </p>
      <p>
       They were also using bots to get their bullshit posts to the top of r/news and other subs, that is why they were not allowed to crosspost to other subs.

       They got caught spamming Reddit, and the rules were applied to stop that behavior.

       And there's the real rub.  Reddit imposes the rules different on T_D in a way that impacts all subs, because the sitewide "no brigading/doxxing/harassing" rule is actually "no brigading/doxxing/harassing unless it's against T_D".  That affects the entire character of the rule and diminishes the integrity of the site.  If you know about this and are being sufficiently honest about yourself, you can't
       <em>
        only
       </em>
       say "those damn T_D Trumptards are ruining the site for everyone", because now you have to live with the reality that a site you might have cared about for years before you even cared about politics now openly caters to the anti-Trump narrative and all the sorts of communities that ally with that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Plus--and I hope the irony here isn't lost on anyone--this feeds right into the anti-leftist reactionary movement (which you see in Youtube/minds.com skeptics and parts of Kekistan) when it claims that the ones screaming loudest about oppression are doing quite a lot of it themselves.  But as Jordan Peterson would put it, the leftists don't give a fuck about anything their opposition could say in the past, present, or future because their aim is not to win over society but to utterly destroy its foundations.

       Posting a thread and posting a comment are different things and no subs like r/HilaryClinton won't ban you for dissent but you will get downvoted. Also r/HilaryClinton doesn't call itself the 'bastion for free speech'.
