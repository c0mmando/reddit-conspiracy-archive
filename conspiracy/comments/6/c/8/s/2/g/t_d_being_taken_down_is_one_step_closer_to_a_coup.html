       Everything has been leading up to this with the censorship from the deep state and pushing of the Russian narrative. It will culminate in a coup, with "an evil foreign power has infiltrated our government" as the rallying cry. The Time cover exposed this propaganda for anyone red-pilled.
      </p>
      <p>
       Communities like this need to stay vigilant and call out false narratives as they come down.

       it's possible, but not definitive.  a few mods got banned by admins (which may be the real fuckery going on with that community) and then it went private.  not sure on the exact timeline, just posts i've ran into on my relaxing night of baseball and refreshing new.

       yeah, but they seem to think that it's something deeper.  a few of their mods were banned a bit before it happened so it looks a little shadier than a mod protest - especially when you add in the progress they were making on seth rich case.
      </p>
      <p>
       also, i think a lot of people missed the message and details because you don't see that kind of stuff when browsing on mobile, apparently.

       "progress on the sith rich case" what a joke that case is a hyper partisan witch hunt trying to prove the DNC are murders so american republicans can feel justified in their irrational hatred, the whole thing blew up from the comments of a fox news contributor ffs the republican news network and if that wasnt enough he literally said his comments were unsubstantiated within a few days because he was trying to promote an article.

       that seems to happen a lot.  sometimes you can get a genuine answer/response if you ask in the right place or time.  or go to /pol/ and you may get something after being called a shill in order to bump the post.
      </p>

       i wasn't following it too close, but that seems to be the general narrative.  i did notice a lot of censorship on reddit site-wide over the seth rich stuff the past few days, though.

       and now, this being possible censorship too.  it does pique my interest.

       there has been 0 censorship of seth rich posts its been almost half the page of TD and this sub after the fake news about it aired. The TD mess is obviously not cencorship they had stickies inciting witchunts by the mods and they have been warned far more than any other sub :

       my bad, shouldn't have said 'site-wide'.  but several subreddits censored it, even if it did not fall into their rules.
      </p>
      <p>
       i know
       <a href="/r/worldnews">
        /r/worldnews
       </a>
       and
       <a href="/r/news">
        /r/news
       </a>
       censored it.  i ran into a post the other night stating that, and there was nothing on either.  any links posted to them would say something like 'this has already been posted'.  it seems to break
       <a href="/r/worldnews">
        /r/worldnews
       </a>
       rules, but not
       <a href="/r/news">
        /r/news
       </a>
       .  i didn't personally attempt to go any farther than that (just wanted to check if that particular post was bullshit or not), but i saw posts making complaints about other subs too.
      </p>
      <p>
       that'd be my best guess for why these mods were banned too.  i never cared for TD once they started banning me for asking questions, same with
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics
       </a>
       and all the other obvious left/right paradigm subs.  i don't have any hate, it was just frustrating that i couldn't go to either last fall and ask pertinent questions or attempt to have a conversation without getting blasted with bullshit.

       because once you have an outside view its pretty obvious why the would ban it, it appeared hours after news about james comey and completely distracted about the news on right wings the guy who said there were definite links  was known for saying crazy shit like "underground lesbians with pink pistols raping young girls" and he even pubically retracted the statement but the damage is done and he revived a conspiracy for the right to talk about so they can ignore how utterly corrupt trump has been acting.

       i thought it was weird that he said he was releasing whatever THE NEXT MORNING, but never heard much after that so figured his deed was done - sold some books or some shit haha.

       apparently he sparked TD, /pol/, voat, and even here because I have been hearing about it (and those communities) non-stop ever since.

       It already is a coup as far as i'm concerned. Why would they only ban three specific mods (three of the oldest)? Seems pretty obvious that some of the remaining ones are cooperating with reddit admins to take over the place and neuter it.
      </p>
      <p>
       The real scandal isn't that they took over T_D, its that they chose to do it at a specific time to divert attention from the Seth Rich investigation (and have since started censoring talk of it where they can). If they're actively trying to suppress people from solving his murder, some might call that obstruction of justice.

       This happens at a time when T_D was getting closer to linking the DNC with Seth Rich's murder (with concrete evidence to boot). Something's going down! True fuckery's afoot!

       "progress on the sith rich case" what a joke that case is a hyper partisan witch hunt trying to prove the DNC are murders so american republicans can feel justified in their irrational hatred, the whole thing blew up from the comments of a fox news contributor ffs the republican news network and if that wasnt enough he literally said his comments were unsubstantiated within a few days because he was trying to promote an article.
