       You may have heard of the twitter account
       <a href="https://twitter.com/kibbitzlaw">
        victoryofthelight
       </a>
       also known as KibBitzLaw. They have agreed to join our small conspiracy discord (
       <a href="https://discord.gg/j7vQXJK">
        https://discord.gg/j7vQXJK
       </a>
       ) for discussion tomorrow.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you would like to join the discussion you are welcome, as I think you guys should have the chance to speak with them and ask questions. Just follow the rules and don't be too aggressive as we don't want to turn them away.
      </p>
      <p>
       Proof that they will be joining is

       Yeah, I'm not going 'in depth' for some kind of expose. Sometimes all this is just for attention and to distract. It's possible the negative attention is just as attractive to them as positive. Putting too much time into it isn't worth it. Also, some accounts who support it may be bots/socks/people in on the scam. Because it's hard to see how folks could fall for most of it.

       The vocabulary he uses discredits him slightly but the linked video to Morgan Freemans Through The Wormhole regarding ether and the force ect was really interesting. Still cautiously optimistic.

       Sure. I'm not saying there isn't some good stuff weaved in there. However, I could have linked that Morgan Freeman video too, so could anyone else. The things exclusive to that account, like him saying he was personally responsible for having Comey arrested or on 5/10 saying Hillary was being arrested that day, I feel is overwhelmingly convincing of its fraudulence.

       I didn't suggest that, and I find it curious that just because I disagreed, you would assert that.  You go on believing that Barack Obama just happened to be their first follower, (giggle).  I'm sure the former president doesn't have anything else to do.

       I based my comment off of the fact that you seemed like you didn't want to discuss with them because you believe them to be frauds. I am skeptical about them and their claims, as everyone should be, and I will be asking them about those things :)

       Yeah they had a tweet admitting they worked for the DNC at some time during the Obama administration. I tried to help people understand that this is why Obama followed the account (which was a big part of the initial hoopla). Since referencing it, the tweet has been deleted. That told me a lot about their manipulative motivations. There's numerous other stuff too. Just the tone the twitter account uses should be enough to ascertain its validity on certain claims being made.

       It's not a psyop. He's calling out the peolle who run the psy-ops. I know it's not what any of us had inavined, but perhaps this is what Disclosure looks like in 2017. We have a Twitter-famous President, and so a twitter account tweeting at people claiming they are Draco Reptilians may be how disclosure begins.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you stay well read on some of the long-standing UFO researchers and listen to Coast2Coast on the regular, you know that this year, specifically May, was planned for a "partial disclosure", by Podesta and his Cabal to save their heads when a story like Seth Rich's began to make headlines. Not a coincidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       Partial disclosure was going to read like, "OMGZ! We found skyscrapers under the ice in Antarctica!! Aliens came to Earth before us guys!!!" And then maybe some Reptilians show themselves and the Dems and the media begin convincing the public to praise them as Gods, as they will give us such great technology (the stuff the MIlitary Industrial Complex has been withholding from us since the 40s). Not an ideal situation.
      </p>
      <p>
       What Victory of the Light is pushing for with their strategy of publically shaming the Draco and their Babylonian Talmudist cohorts looks like it's pushing towards Full Disclosure. They do not want you knowing about the deal the governments made years ago that supplies Draco with children for consumption. They don't want us to connect that to PedoGate.
      </p>
      <p>
       The truth makes you recoil in horror. But as someone who has known about the Draco race for 20 years, I can tell you that the fear era replaced with outrage and passion. And that is what Victory of the Lights tweets are filled with. That's what we need.
      </p>
      <p>
       Clear your mind. Forget what is "impossible". Meditate if you have to.  And then, with no preconceived notions, ask yourself, are these things connected.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't turn away from truth because it's horrible. That's what these sick fucks are counting on.

       Yeah they had a tweet admitting they worked for the DNC at some time during the Obama administration. I tried to help people understand that this is why Obama followed the account (which was a big part of the initial hoopla). Since referencing it, the tweet has been deleted. That told me a lot about their manipulative motivations. There's numerous other stuff too. Just the tone the twitter account uses should be enough to ascertain its validity on certain claims being made.

       Sure. I'm not saying there isn't some good stuff weaved in there. However, I could have linked that Morgan Freeman video too, so could anyone else. The things exclusive to that account, like him saying he was personally responsible for having Comey arrested or on 5/10 saying Hillary was being arrested that day, I feel is overwhelmingly convincing of its fraudulence.
