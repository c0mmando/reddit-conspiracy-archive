       Draining the Swamp is not a simple matter. There are

       to JFK.

       The media is under

       We need to get the economy

       This is a battle against the Deep State itself, and it is not simple, but it can be won if we do it the right way.

       Jesus saves us from our evil selves. When we accept His sacrifice on our behalf, we are born again spiritually,  without the need, tendency for evil. It takes time for this reality to work itself out in our daily experience, but it is the only power that will do so. And it reserves us as God's forever.

       I don't believe that because I don't find sufficient evidence for your statement. In order to have a valid logic statement you have to prove your premises or have sound premises. In your statement you mentioned Jesus's and god then make claims about these but I need evidence that god exists first and also evidence that Jesus is who you claim he is etc. also in this reality you think there's a god that created all this and was all knowing so why did it create cancer in children? Even if you have evidence for a god I would ask why it created such disgusting evil?

       You don't have little proof ( you cited/referenced none) that removing negative traits from human DNA would resolve anything either.  Oddly enough, we do have proof god exists, the Bible. You can challenge and question it, but it is evidence of his existence .  Chill out.

       The Bible is evidence of god, it's only evidence that humankind compiled a series of texts together into one book. Also if the Bible was evidence of god then god is a rotten immoral piece of shit because he said a rapist has to buy the raped girl for marriage for 50 shekels of silver, screw that god. This god also created child cancer and had to brutally torture and mutilate his own rape baby to forgive sins, yea no thanks.

       Scientific vs law forms of proof of evidence.   Scientifically, can you prove god exists? No.  Law, you would work on documentation, testimony, and you would have some basis to say "okay, what is the odds all these people got together and individually created the bible as a joke or as a farce?" Being that it was very rare to read let alone write we are to believe that they wasted such time and skill on it?  It could happen, sure, however, I am thinking probability.
      </p>
      <p>
       Furthermore, did god say a rapist has to buy the raped girl or was that an account from a king?  As some portions of the bible are attributed to kings or prophets not God or Jesus.  If you are going to be specific in your accusations then lets keep it that way.  Regardless, even if God said something shitty it is immaterial as to his existence.  God's have been proven not to be shitty? If they choose to be does that negate their power/status?
      </p>
      <p>
       You make assumptions that I am limiting my thoughts but I am not.  I am merely pointing out that there is a line between.  I do believe in a God and that Jesus Christ existed but I am not limited to the bible being the only/sole interpretation of how it works as man created it and man is with faults.
      </p>
      <p>
       I find it ironic from my one statement you derived from me the "Typical Christian" who is limited in world views or acceptance of other scientific realty before asking for any clarity.  Again Chill out.

       Well, there is much evidence for God, Jesus for one, His rising from the dead for 2, and the witness of millions.  It is an entirely different topic, that you must have entertained bec atheism is a learned condition. Best to you.

       The New Testament is a record taken from first hand accounts of witnesses that lived in the time of Jesus. There are also additional historical records that describe His existence as factual, though not in detail or necessarily supporting His claims of being Messiah.
      </p>
      <p>
       Jesus fulfilled hundreds of prophecies written about him hundreds of years before He was born. A statistical impossibility without divine intervention.
      </p>
      <p>
       You cannot use the scientific method to prove Jesus.  He is not a natural law.  But the historical evidence is very compelling, if you research it.

       The New Testament is not a first hand account, they aren't even contemporary with when Jesus lived. They surfaced decades later. You also have no way of discerning whether or not they are true. As far as you know they are literally just ink and paper and nothing more.
      </p>
      <p>
       If Jesus cannot be proven using testable data then there's no reason to believe in him especially when believing demands a whole set of practices that change your life. It's not like believing in Shakespeare. If I say I believe Shakespeare nothing in my life changes, but the same can't be said about Jesus and this demands an even higher level of evidence.

       Your quote about fulfilling prophecy is ridiculous because if an author or authors wrote fake stuff about him then he could fulfill any prophecy... sheesh that's not hard to see the flaw with that.

       The accounts (gospels -Matthew, Luke, Mark &amp; John) of Jesus were not written by first hand accounts but by ppl who heard these first hand accounts and then wrote them down within a generation or so. But some New Testament books were written by ppl of the time, particularly, the Apostle Paul, who wrote several letters to the budding churches shortly after Jesus' death. Other apostles wrote such letters, such as James, and the Apostle John, who wrote Revelation --had hand first hand knowledge of Jesus).  All the disciples died violently for standing up for their beliefs. What would cause such sacrifice, I wonder?  These letters make up much of the New Testament and were written immediately in the aftermath of Jesus death and resurrection.
      </p>
      <p>
       If fulfilling prophecy is so simple, why aren't ppl making prophecies and having them fulfilled every other day?  Your statement makes no sense. Prophecies regarding many other things have also been fulfilled and are even now being fulfilled --including His return.

       Actually the coming of the messiah was supposed to usher in world peace but Jesus failed miserably at that. Was also supposed to gather the Jews but they were scattered shortly after arriving so he was a stupid failure IF he even existed. It was a bunch of secular Jews that pushed for Zionism not some messiah...

       There's nothing in prophecy about the messiah having to come back, it's just bullshit people had to say to explain why their messiah was dead.

       You cannot even prove he existed let alone that he saved mankind. Also you would have to prove that their was some spiritual eternal death and how he exactly saved us from this and the processes behind them.

       Jesus told us He was coming back to fulfill all the prophecies regarding Himself. The book of Revelation also states He will return. So, when you say, 'there is nothing in prophecy' you mean...  what?
      </p>
      <p>
       If you are interested there is a book that traces back the reports and compiling of the scriptures, written by a police detective, so he uses forensic and investigative principles to analyze the evidence we have.

       Very common misunderstanding that God allows suffering, when He could avoid it. Ppl are selfish, greedy, wicked and this causes their actions against others to have horrible consequences. The whole creation was thrown into this degradation bec man failed to follow God's advice and avoid eating from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. The consequence of which, he was warned, would be that he would surely die (spiritually).
      </p>
      <p>
       If anything, God gave His Son, Jesus, to pay for that huge mistake man did and make it possible for us to be with Him again, forever. This time on earth is certainly cursed ...and short, while His salvation will last forever, even if you are a kid that dies of cancer.
      </p>
      <p>
       I took the time to explain even though I doubt you seriously care to understand God better. But, just in case... there you go.
