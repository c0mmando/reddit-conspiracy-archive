        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Draining the Swamp is not a simple matter. There are <a href="https://thecenterofthedecentralized.wordpress.com/2017/02/17/former-cia-operative-robert-david-steele-trump-is-battling-pedophile-network">pedophile rings</a> that control most of Washington through blackmail. The deep state assassinates people, from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Webb">journalists</a> to JFK.</p>

<p>The media is under <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Mockingbird">CIA control</a>. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Earnest_Voice">deep state</a> pays shills to lie to people on the internet. And the last president was a <a href="http://conspiracyarchive.com/Articles/Obama_CIA.htm">CIA agent</a>. </p>

<p>But it gets worse. The economy is dependent on <a href="https://www.lewrockwell.com/2014/11/nathan-kleffman/cia-drug-dealing/">CIA drug-dealing</a>. If Trump tries to take the whole thing down, they can crash the economy. Or send <a href="http://gulagbound.com/12652/top-5-revolutions-backed-by-george-soros/">Soros</a> to start a revolution.</p>

<p>We need to get the economy <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/65s0oo/alex_joness_lawyers_tell_court_not_to_take/dgdb6yx/">jump-started</a> again with some real <a href="https://newfederalistpapers.joomla.com/11-orbitalring">innovative thinking</a>, to have enough money to be able to jettison the pervert elites and their drug money. And we need to talk about ideas like this to unite with the reasonable Americans so that Soros can&#39;t run a coup.</p>

<p>This is a battle against the Deep State itself, and it is not simple, but it can be won if we do it the right way.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t believe that because I don&#39;t find sufficient evidence for your statement. In order to have a valid logic statement you have to prove your premises or have sound premises. In your statement you mentioned Jesus&#39;s and god then make claims about these but I need evidence that god exists first and also evidence that Jesus is who you claim he is etc. also in this reality you think there&#39;s a god that created all this and was all knowing so why did it create cancer in children? Even if you have evidence for a god I would ask why it created such disgusting evil?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Bible is evidence of god, it&#39;s only evidence that humankind compiled a series of texts together into one book. Also if the Bible was evidence of god then god is a rotten immoral piece of shit because he said a rapist has to buy the raped girl for marriage for 50 shekels of silver, screw that god. This god also created child cancer and had to brutally torture and mutilate his own rape baby to forgive sins, yea no thanks.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Scientific vs law forms of proof of evidence.   Scientifically, can you prove god exists? No.  Law, you would work on documentation, testimony, and you would have some basis to say &quot;okay, what is the odds all these people got together and individually created the bible as a joke or as a farce?&quot; Being that it was very rare to read let alone write we are to believe that they wasted such time and skill on it?  It could happen, sure, however, I am thinking probability.  </p>

<p>Furthermore, did god say a rapist has to buy the raped girl or was that an account from a king?  As some portions of the bible are attributed to kings or prophets not God or Jesus.  If you are going to be specific in your accusations then lets keep it that way.  Regardless, even if God said something shitty it is immaterial as to his existence.  God&#39;s have been proven not to be shitty? If they choose to be does that negate their power/status?</p>

<p>You make assumptions that I am limiting my thoughts but I am not.  I am merely pointing out that there is a line between.  I do believe in a God and that Jesus Christ existed but I am not limited to the bible being the only/sole interpretation of how it works as man created it and man is with faults.  </p>

<p>I find it ironic from my one statement you derived from me the &quot;Typical Christian&quot; who is limited in world views or acceptance of other scientific realty before asking for any clarity.  Again Chill out.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The New Testament is not a first hand account, they aren&#39;t even contemporary with when Jesus lived. They surfaced decades later. You also have no way of discerning whether or not they are true. As far as you know they are literally just ink and paper and nothing more.</p>

<p>If Jesus cannot be proven using testable data then there&#39;s no reason to believe in him especially when believing demands a whole set of practices that change your life. It&#39;s not like believing in Shakespeare. If I say I believe Shakespeare nothing in my life changes, but the same can&#39;t be said about Jesus and this demands an even higher level of evidence.</p>

<p>Your quote about fulfilling prophecy is ridiculous because if an author or authors wrote fake stuff about him then he could fulfill any prophecy... sheesh that&#39;s not hard to see the flaw with that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The accounts (gospels -Matthew, Luke, Mark &amp; John) of Jesus were not written by first hand accounts but by ppl who heard these first hand accounts and then wrote them down within a generation or so. But some New Testament books were written by ppl of the time, particularly, the Apostle Paul, who wrote several letters to the budding churches shortly after Jesus&#39; death. Other apostles wrote such letters, such as James, and the Apostle John, who wrote Revelation --had hand first hand knowledge of Jesus).  All the disciples died violently for standing up for their beliefs. What would cause such sacrifice, I wonder?  These letters make up much of the New Testament and were written immediately in the aftermath of Jesus death and resurrection. </p>

<p>If fulfilling prophecy is so simple, why aren&#39;t ppl making prophecies and having them fulfilled every other day?  Your statement makes no sense. Prophecies regarding many other things have also been fulfilled and are even now being fulfilled --including His return. </p>

<p>The Jews scattered and persecuted. 
The Jews gathered back to Israel. 
The Jewish temple to be rebuilt.
The removal of cash from society.
The Mark of the Beast required for buying or selling. 
Death to those who refuse the Mark.
A satanic world government with a world leader (antiChrist).
Many natural disasters, etc. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s nothing in prophecy about the messiah having to come back, it&#39;s just bullshit people had to say to explain why their messiah was dead.</p>

<p>You cannot even prove he existed let alone that he saved mankind. Also you would have to prove that their was some spiritual eternal death and how he exactly saved us from this and the processes behind them.</p>

<p>Bitter and disrespectful to the lord? Fuck him while he lets little kids die from cancer, fuck him if he exists.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Jesus told us He was coming back to fulfill all the prophecies regarding Himself. The book of Revelation also states He will return. So, when you say, &#39;there is nothing in prophecy&#39; you mean...  what?</p>

<p>If you are interested there is a book that traces back the reports and compiling of the scriptures, written by a police detective, so he uses forensic and investigative principles to analyze the evidence we have.  </p>

<p>&quot;Cold-Case Christianity: A Homicide Detective Investigates the Claims of the Gospels&quot; by J. Warner Wallace, Lee Strobel</p>

<p>Very common misunderstanding that God allows suffering, when He could avoid it. Ppl are selfish, greedy, wicked and this causes their actions against others to have horrible consequences. The whole creation was thrown into this degradation bec man failed to follow God&#39;s advice and avoid eating from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. The consequence of which, he was warned, would be that he would surely die (spiritually). </p>

<p>If anything, God gave His Son, Jesus, to pay for that huge mistake man did and make it possible for us to be with Him again, forever. This time on earth is certainly cursed ...and short, while His salvation will last forever, even if you are a kid that dies of cancer. </p>

<p>I took the time to explain even though I doubt you seriously care to understand God better. But, just in case... there you go. </p>
