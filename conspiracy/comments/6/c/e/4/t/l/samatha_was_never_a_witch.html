    <div class="md"><p>When we look at Homeric poetry or Greek mythology, we see that the gods are capricious and essentially <em>human</em>, particularly in their flaws of character (best shown in Zeus&#39;s lust and Hera&#39;s jealousy), and also the way in which they favor certain mortals over others. There are also numerous examples of the gods scheming against each other through the lives of the mortals. The appeal to individuals within the choir of existing extra-dimensional beings is also a narrative in just about every religion, cult, and mythology. </p>

<p>The observation that she married an astronaut never really struck me. She seems to have super powers for sure, but what if this is not because she is extra-terrestrial, but a glorified MK-ULTRA kitten? Being married to a man who is gone for months at a time, in space? Being an Apollo doubter, I have my own crazy ideas about this. Besides that, Elizabeth Berkeley was probably my first TV crush, turn&#39;t up nose and all... In this sense, the plot doesn&#39;t necessarily prepare the public to accept all-powerful beings, as much as it says &quot;marry a military man, practice magic, and have the world on a string.&quot; Referring back to the practices of Crowley (and somewhat of Dee), we know how the &quot;initiated&quot; do &quot;magick&quot;. </p>

<p>Just my $.02... Commence the downvotes! :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nope. On Bewitched, the very nosy neighbor Gladys Kravitz, was always watching Sam, so she saw all kinds of shit go down, but her husband never believed her (she took a lot of sedatives because it stressed her out so much that no one else ever validated what she said she saw). Sam&#39;s mom and cousin also took great pleasure in doing things to fuck with her and they gave zero fucks who saw anything, so randoms would often see them popping in/out of places, etc. </p>

<p>On Jeannie, Major Nelson&#39;s BFF and astronaut co-pilot (they were stranded together on the island when he found the bottle w Jeannie), so he was aware of everything she could do as he was a constant presence.
