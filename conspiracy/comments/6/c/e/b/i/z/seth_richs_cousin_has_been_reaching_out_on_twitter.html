       <p>
        First thing I said when my Dad told me was he knew something and he was murdered. The rest of the family thought I was nuts. See last name.

       It's a part of the conspiracy.  It shows that members of his family believe something suspicious happened.  Don't you understand that?

       I don't really have a bias on this or not,

       Do I think Bauman is a PR hack? Sure. 
But Wheeler is a bit more than a PI without an agenda?

       Bauman was also once executive director of the Congressional Progressive Caucus which was founded by Bernie Sanders.  Maybe Sanders is behind it if all you're doing is playing six degrees of separation?

       Did I say I believed anyone did it?  I don't think using him as your spokesperson is the best way to deter the debunking of theories &amp; thought it odd he proactively declared that if there is shown to be a connection to WL, it doesnt mean anything.  Why make that statement proactively if your intention is solely to speak for the family &amp; not to protect the party?  His statements read as statements meant to protect the DNC, not the family.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also don't like how WAPO's debunking didn't address early reporting that he was conscious and comment on whether or not they asked officers if he said anything.  Doesnt look into the fact that there were apparently armed robberies in the area around that time involving a silver gun - were the police looking into that?  Were those people ever caught?
      </p>
      <p>
       There's been no follow up on the murder.  No one seems to be investigating it or trying to find who killed a 27 year old person who seemed only to want to make the world a better place.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are questions that people find curious that are being largely ignored. I hope that's because they are closing in on the murderer behind the scenes.

        I don't think using him as your spokesperson is the best way to deter the debunking of theories &amp; thought it odd he proactively declared that if there is shown to be a connection to WL, it doesnt mean anything.

        I don't think that was the primary reason for hiring him.  They're from Nebraska.  They probably just hired him because he was recommended to them by someone.

        There's been no follow up on the murder. No one seems to be investigating it or trying to find who killed

       How do you know this?  Do you attend meetings at MPDC? What about the lawyer and PI the family have  hired?  What about the $125,000 in rewards?  I would guess that is considerably more effort than is put into most murders in DC.

       He wanted to do his job at the DNC, drink beer, and watch football.  I don't think he seemed particularly idealistic.  Not that I know that much about him.  He seemed like a nice enough guy, but working at the DNC isn't exactly digging wells for thirsty children in the third world.

      <p>
       The only thing that is being ignored is Assange, and that's because he won't come out and actually say it or sign a sworn affidavit.  The police can't get a warrant to search the DNC computers based on on a tweet that just hints that he leaked the emails.  If Assange really wanted to solve this mystery,  which he doesn't, he would put up or shut up.

       Imagine your son worked for The Dallas Cowboys , his favorite team. And after his death , Jerry Jones came to you - said nice things about your son - and offered to help.  In that moment would you have the forethought to deny your son's "hero" offer?

       I know you're saying this jokingly and with no bad intention, but I personally use these comments sparingly--they have a legit chilling effect on people who may think of coming forward with valuable info. It's a subtle way of saying, "talk and you're dead," which doesn't help our cause.
