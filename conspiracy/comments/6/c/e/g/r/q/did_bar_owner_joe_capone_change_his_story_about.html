        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Reported September 9, 2016, Capone said &quot;I heard there was a bunch of robberies lately by a man with a silver gun in the area... he was here just by himself that night and [uh or I] even asked him if I could give him a ride home.&quot;

As reported on May 20, 2017, Capone now says he was in Ocean City, MD on the day Seth Rich was murdered.

Webb responded: George Webb &quot;Uh oh, when the story changes, that is a bad sign.&quot;
If you watch the entire CW video, you see HRC making political capital out of Seth&#39;s murder. You may also recall the robbery narrative was set from day one. However, it was easily attacked because nothing was stolen from Seth and we learned he was not in a high-crime area. Additionally, Assange made statements that all but confirmed Seth Rich was the source of the leaks.
Recall in March 2017, the Establishment tried to float the story that Rich was assassinated by the Russians to fit with muh Russia narrative and in light of the serious holes in the robbery story.
Now enter Capone. Generally, a witness&#39; initial statements are more reliable closer to the actual event. However, he pushed the robbery narrative, even describing a silver gun. Now that the heat is on, his story changes. If he&#39;s a stooge, someone&#39;s doing a poor job of handling him.</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong> This post is getting negative attention after initial support. </p>

<p>In response to a comment that Webb was convinced by Capone, while that was true initially, not after being directed to the prior interview. </p>

<p>Webb&#39;s YouTube comments said &quot;Uh oh, when the story changes, that is a bad sign,&quot; and &quot;This isn&#39;t good. This is a huge discrepancy.&quot;</p>

<p>Has Webb spoken to any DC detectives about the case yet or tried to?  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Webb said the following: &quot;...he was not here, the whole cab story is not true, he was in Ocean City, Maryland, with his family, so him putting or not putting Seth Rich in a cab at 1:45 am is complete bunk.&quot; </p>

<p>In context, sounds like Capone is now saying he was in Ocean City, MD the day (evening/early morning) Seth was murdered.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Seth was murdered at 4:30 in the morning, so he would need to be there the day before, does Webb have direct evidence of Capone staying in a hotel the night before Seth&#39;s murder or was he still working at the bar? I feel like if he wasn&#39;t there that night, we would know by now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It does not appear Webb has direct evidence of Capone&#39;s whereabouts other than what Capone has told him. Webb thought Capone appeared truthful during their discussion, but upon learning of the prior interview, he couched it as a &quot;huge discrepancy.&quot; <a href="http://i.imgur.com/J2Y17NT.png">http://i.imgur.com/J2Y17NT.png</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Or it could be poor explanation, like I said, Capone could make that trip pretty easily on the day Seth was killed, he could have simultaneously worked that night/day and still have made the trip with his family, can&#39;t rule that out until further evidence is provided.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Clearly, we need to be rigorous with the evidence, so I am not disagreeing. However, Webb interviewed Capone and he finds it to be a material change in the story and a &quot;bad sign.&quot; If Webb has an update, I&#39;ll make sure to add it to the post.</p>
