       Anyone else been keeping up with him/her? My gut says bluebeam but I'm entertained regardless.

       Anyone got any good leads/theories/links/vids on the stargate?  Or different alien races?

       I'll even read/watch listen to some antizionist stuff if it's well backed and presented.  Please don't link me to TGSNT.  Thanks.

       Also here's her "debating" with fellow CFR member Jake Tapper on CNN about Syria and his she met with Assad, just as a controlled opposition spy would. Listen to the way she words everything in the clip- she could easily be promoting Assads removal if you look at the way she words things.

       Hm, a lot of the "cabal is coming down"/alien stuff comes from Corey Goode and David Wilcocke.
      </p>
      <p>
       A lot of the mystic school teachings practiced by the cabal can be learned from William Cooper's Mystery of Babylon series.
      </p>
      <p>
       To learn more about the cabal itself and their innerworkings, I'd suggest George Webb.
      </p>

       I'm catching up on William Cooper myself, and I'm way behind in the Webb series.

       If I had to sum it up I'd say... Corey claims he was part of a Secret Space Program for years and interfaced with a number of ET groups. He explains how the Secret Space Program came to be, the motives of the factions within it, how it ties to the cabal here on Earth, and how he is currently assigned to disclose all of this to humanity by an alliance that is here to assist.
      </p>
      <p>
       David asks the questions and they detail how the intel Corey provides aligns with physics, spirituality, testimony of other whistleblowers. Their information aligns with William Tompkins (author of Selected by Extraterrestrials and the subject of a video from a VOL message) on a number of levels.

       It is a wild ride, but I'll admit I binged on it for a few days when I first found these sources.

       I think knowledge of ETs is an example of the elite hoarding knowledge for themselves until it can be manipulated for their benefit.
      </p>
      <p>
       The law of free discussed in Ra's Law of One will has prevented good ETs from making overt contact with humans, and even now knowledge is only slowly being disseminated. Those who want to be in contact, however, can often succeed. Some claim to be descendants of positive aliens, like Kibbitz here.
      </p>
      <p>
       As to the bad ones, the ones abducting, mutilating, etc, those are true anecdotes of sinister ETs who have been violating free will laws for some time. It's not born from people "wishing pain upon themselves," as Cooper professes.
      </p>
      <p>
       It would not surprise me if humans have been presented with "fake" ETs to instill control or push a narrative. Project Blue Beam is another example where the establishment would take something real (ETs), invert it, and then use artifice to accumulate power and control.
      </p>
      <p>
       My overall point is, Cooper's premise about using fake ETs to manipulate can still coincide with the fact that aliens do indeed exist. Especially benevolent ones.

       Interesting interview with Bill Cooper. HLI was equally clear on this issue when asked if aliens are real, and it was one of only a handful of answers that made me question his validity.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm curious what you make of things like the Law of One or the similar Hidden Hand dialogues. Any opinion?
      </p>
      <p>
       I got the sense that we profoundly misunderstand the nature of the Universe and that its main evolution isn't outward into space, but inward or... throughward across layered dimensions.
      </p>
      <p>
       In that sense our imaginations of Aliens in space ships and all that seems like a juvenile attempt to explain something we barely comprehend. I may be way off track here, but I'm only beginning to try to understand a mystical world without aliens.

       It's just that it's rare to hear someone say unequivocally that they don't exist, as HLI and Cooper did. To claim they don't exist without explaining how that is statistically possible struck me as odd. But it's certainly not impossible. I find the idea compelling, but it begs a lot of questions in my mind.

       Let's have a look at Bill Cooper. He first actively disseminated the UFO materials and
       <em>
        only later realized
       </em>
       that he was used as well, and that all the UFO stuff was fabricated, a masterful psy-op.
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        Cooper, Behold a Pale Horse, 1991
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       "During his first year in office, 1953, at least 10 more crashed discs were recovered along with 26 dead and 4 live aliens. Of the 10,4 were found in Arizona, 2 in Texas, 1 in New Mexico, 1 in Louisiana, 1 in Montana, and 1 in South Africa. There were hundreds of sightings.
      </p>
      <p>
       Eisenhower knew that he had to wrestle and beat the alien problem. He knew that he could not do it by revealing the secret to the Congress, Early in 1953 the new President turned to his friend and fellow member of the Council on Foreign Relations Nelson Rockefeller. Eisenhower and Rockefeller began planning the secret structure of alien-task supervision, which was to become a reality within one year. The idea for MJ-12 was thus born.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was Nelson's uncle Winthrop Aldrich who had been crucial in convincing Eisenhower to run for President. The whole Rockefeller family and with them, the Rockefeller empire, had solidly backed Ike. Eisenhower belonged heart and soul to the Council on Foreign Relations and the Rockefeller family. Asking Rockefeller for help with the alien problem was to be the biggest mistake Eisenhower ever made for the future of the United States and maybe for humanity."

       "(5) There is always the possibility that I was used, that the whole alien scenario is the greatest hoax in history designed to create an alien enemy from outer space in order to expedite the formation of a one-world government. I have found evidence that this could be true. I have included that evidence in the Appendix. I advise you to consider this scenario as being probable."

       He is much more direct in the 1999 interview though...

       HLI did not say that they do not exist, he said this for example:

       I entered "aliens" into the search field to select only those HLI's answers containing the word, that's why.

       You think he's being 100% or you think he's doing some plausible deniability BS mixing?  They've even hinted at being alien hybrid psychics.  And Nbiru coming around this year.

       Now that her team is in jeopardy if SR or PG theories ever catch legs, it would be a great time to hypothetically launch their last ditch effort to save their asses- fake aliens, fake explosions- meanwhile they scurry to a dope secret Antarctic base/utopia to finish their lives...

       I guess FF wouldn't be the best word.  Maybe manipulated disclosure.  Idk. I guess if aliens are real then the human "cabal" probably isn't such a high threat anymore anyway.

       On the other hand "bluebeam" itself could be an idea floated to spread confusion and mental resistance to something like this.

       Hi boys and girls. We've told you repeatedly who we are here on Reddit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Twitter is our means by which to ease people into some things with very basic, yet nearly irrefutable, evidence re: certain matters.
      </p>
      <p>
       We got started on their because of how well our more in-depth posts were received here on Reddit.
      </p>
      <p>
       We are hoping to have a far more extensive follow up post, pertaining to Twitter account blowing up, on here by MondayZ
      </p>
      <p>
       For now, use our prior work for your own discernment, judgment and conclusions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Cheers
      </p>

       That's Jedi master TJ.  The force is strong with you.  Excuse me for not being all in on you guys.  You gotta understand as a fellow conspiracy redditer that we gotta hold a grain of skepticism, especially with the blue beam rumors.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway,  assuming y'all are bout it bout it- thanks for putting your necks out to a degree and giving us something g to latch on to.

       I hope you guys will address bluebeam and "what" you are claiming to be (aliens? Hybrids? Psychics? ) in your next big post.  I'll be eagerly awaiting it.  Good shit and keep up the good work.  i think you guys have invested too much for this to be a larp by a rando anon

       I empathize with someone when I think they are saying delusional things based upon some type of illness or aspect of our being we as a species don't fully understand. HOWEVER, it's clear to me you are a liar. Delete tweets based upon typos? Probably not. Why did you delete that tweet talking about how you used to support and work for the DNC. As for some of your other claims, they have been ludicrously all over the place. First you're 'the evangelist' from revelations, and some guy who claims he was the one who brought Comey down. Now it's some lie about you (plural for some reason, as there's likely a whole little group of trolls involved here) as some kind of ETI, and/or 'missing link'. It's comical and not even the slightest bit believable for anyone with a sliver of critical thinking skills. You tone definitely gives you away also. I'd suggest stopping the little game, apologizing, and admitting the truth. If not, I think you're going to learn some rather harsh lessons as a result of your manipulative and deceptive behavior. You're very similar to those you claim to expose. Great irony for sure.

       He could be one of the greatest contemporary larpers, or he's telling the truth.

       Also I like his approach regarding zionism, that's pretty cool. Dunno if he's affiliated with Cobra, but
       <a href="/u/ModernDayTJ">

       should get a blog.
       <br/>
       Also, TJ, if you're reading, why do you delete some tweets? Are these things that we were not supposed to see yet? Kinda intriguing.

       Well, this sure is interesting.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Rogue One was trying to tell you something...as many Star Wars films have. Rogue One's message?
      </p>
      <p>
       By the way: Do you think it was a coincidence that the Jedi Holy City of Jedda in Rogue One is one letter off from Jeddah, Saudi Arabia? Here's a hint: It's not. Jeddah, Saudi Arabia is the port into Mecca, where the Kabbah (Black Rock) is located. The Kabbah (Black Rock) is a weapon linked to identical Kabbahs on one of Saturn's moons and Mars.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Flag of the Empire flies over the Holy City of Jeddah/Jedda. So the question is this: Who controls the Death Star/Kabbah right now? Considering that British Royal Crown created Wahhabism in 1700s, created Israel at the request of Rothschilds, created the OSS/CIA through manipulation of US portion of Allied High Command in WWII, was in collusion with Bush family to create Al-Qaeda and then ISIS, there is a pattern. All roads of evil lead to @PrincePhilipDoE and his wife. Isn't that right @CruickshankPaul?

       I think knowledge of ETs is an example of the elite hoarding knowledge for themselves until it can be manipulated for their benefit.
      </p>
      <p>
       The law of free discussed in Ra's Law of One will has prevented good ETs from making overt contact with humans, and even now knowledge is only slowly being disseminated. Those who want to be in contact, however, can often succeed. Some claim to be descendants of positive aliens, like Kibbitz here.
      </p>
      <p>
       As to the bad ones, the ones abducting, mutilating, etc, those are true anecdotes of sinister ETs who have been violating free will laws for some time. It's not born from people "wishing pain upon themselves," as Cooper professes.
      </p>
      <p>
       It would not surprise me if humans have been presented with "fake" ETs to instill control or push a narrative. Project Blue Beam is another example where the establishment would take something real (ETs), invert it, and then use artifice to accumulate power and control.
      </p>
      <p>
       My overall point is, Cooper's premise about using fake ETs to manipulate can still coincide with the fact that aliens do indeed exist. Especially benevolent ones.
