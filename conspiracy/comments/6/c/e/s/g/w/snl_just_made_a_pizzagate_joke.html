       Colin Jost just made a joke dismissing Pizza Gate on the SNL news. This is the only place I can post about it to vent.

       Just upvoted the three snl related post..refreshed and all have been downvoted..would live some discussion on this.  Long time lurker but first time I've seen many oddities in a live show.  The rock saying hail Satan, the pizzagate dismissal, the Trump Epstein connection, there are likely others I missed.  Any ideas what that is all about?

       They're probably all getting downvoted because not everyone watches SNL, so when these posts make vague references to what happened without adding in context (which is pretty vital when talking about satire/comedy) the posts pretty much just become violations of Rule 12 since there's nothing the community can actually discuss about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the OP's wrote descriptions of the sketches and added all the context to the jokes, or just waited until the episode could be uploaded somewhere to show the clips, they might get more attention.

       SNL and NBC usually don't let the sketches exist outside of the "SNL specials" DVDs.

       Lorne Michaels and NBC are paid parts of the Clinton Machine. A machine still working tirelessly to install chaos for the next two years to foil future Republican victories.

       I just wonder if it works. I think Trump is actually right that the material SNL dpes about him is weak and sounds more like propaganda than satire. It's not like when Chevy Chase would knock over a Christmas tree as Gerald Ford for goofs. It tows one very specific line about Russia and hammers it and that all dissenters are deplorable or working for America's enemies.

       I personally haven't found SNL funny in the slightest since Meyers, Carvey, Hartmann, etc.

       Wrong, people were charged but Paul Bonacci, the main witness, had his perjury charges dropped.

        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Bonacci was awarded  $1mil when Lawrence King didn't show up to court. The judgement included:
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       "The now uncontradicted evidence is that the plaintiff has suffered
much. He has suffered burns, broken fingers, beating of the head
and face and other indignities by the wrongful actions of the
defendant King. In addition to the misery of going through the
experiences just related over a period of eight years, the
plaintiff has suffered the lingering results to the present time.
He is a victim of multiple personality disorder, involving as many
as fourteen distinct personalities aside from his primary
personality. He has given up a desired military career and received
threats on his life. He suffers from sleeplessness, has bad dreams,
has difficulty in holding a job, is fearful that others are
following him, fears getting killed, has depressing flashbacks, and
is verbally violent on occasion, all in connection with the
multiple personality disorder and caused by the wrongful activities
of the defendant King."
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        If it was a hoax and Bonacci was lying, how did he correctly identify multiple scars on Johnny Gosch's body when that information had never been shared by the family?

       I honestly haven't read more that the Wikipedia entry. If you're correct, the article should be updated.
       <br/>
       I am on your side, but PG has no evidence... I looked into every claim and it's really all bullshit. Drawing conclusions from very very coincidental bits and the list of codewords is a lie, fbi memo only mentioned "cheese pizza". And i see this bullshit list about how every food item is a sex crime code... All fabricated. 
My conspiracy hypothesis on elite pedos is that the elite are pedos first, caught by the mysterious shadow government or whatever... Rothschild's maybe?  then put into power with a guaranteed control mechanism via blackmail and sexual rewards (which makes more blackmail)... Like enslaving a junkie with heroin.
       <br/>
       But they're not going to have pedo logos disguised as pizza logos. Or make jokes about it on social media. They'd be way more secretive. The locations would be private with gates and barred windows.
       <br/>
       But that's just my guess.
       <br/>
       P.s. cory haynes (or cory feldman?) wrote an autobiography claiming a Hollywood pedo conspiracy pimped him out... So check that one out too.

       Why not? Hardly anyone even knew of the FBI logo prior to last fall, and it was declassified ten years ago. It's about arrogance. They think they're untouchable and can hide things in plain sight because they're not the common folk, they are the powerful.

       This is pretty on point. When the cops raided Epstein's mansion in Florida, they found cameras hidden around the place. So yeah, host a party with prominent individuals, give them a pretty girl to have some fun with, oops, turns out she's actually 15 and now we've got you two on video. If they play along, yep, they're given access to the forbidden fruits of the rich and powerful.

       /conspiracy is not pizzagate.  And yes apparently people do care what we think,  hence the influx of shills and the main mods force-feeding an agenda.  If you can't see that than you're feeding into conformation bias..  exactly as they intended.

       It might sound unlikely, but think about it...a year ago virtually no one knew who Alex Jones was. Now my parents talk about him. There's been a serious mainstreaming of conspiracy stuff over the past election cycle, for better or worse (usually the latter). It wouldn't surprise me at all if one of the SNL staff members follows us, most likely just for the lulz. What I saw last night seemed...deliberate. My bias may be causing me to read tea leaves here, but it really did look weird.

       Your statement simply is not true, at all, even remotely.  You must be new to this scene.  Google when Alex Jones infiltrated Bohemian Grove.  He's been nationally known since then and his 9/11 docs.  And even before then everyone in Texas knew his name.

       Yes, I'm aware of Alex Jones' history. Surely you understand by what I mean by "mainstream?" Metalheads and college students wouldn't really qualify. When you're getting name-checked by SNL and every single late night show, as well as the US president, I'd say you're officially pop-culturally relevant. Yes, I'm too young to have experienced the Bohemian Grove story when Alex broke it, but he was part of the reason I was first exposed to 9/11 theories, and I was definitely paying attention to him through the Obama years. Conspiracy theories have been mainstreamed in the past, but the internet has changed a lot; for instance, making it far easier for mainstream audiences to peer into fringe communities. This accelerates the mainstreaming process.

       There seems to be a disconnect between what I type and your responses. Of course I don't think the scene got started "when I noticed it." Where did I imply that?
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's take it back to the comment that started all of this. I speculated that someone on the SNL team might have knowledge of recent conspiracy theories and be trolling us. That's all it was: speculation. I guess that was my plan, or "agenda" as you would call it. You took issue with my claim that Alex is currently at the height of his popularity. My evidence for that was purely anecdotal, and I think I was pretty clear about that. That being said, according to
       <a href="http://www.rank2traffic.com/infowars.com">
        this website
       </a>
       , I'm not that far off the mark.
      </p>
      <p>
       No hard feelings, but I really don't have any interest in continuing this conversation if you're just going to put words in my mouth.

       That's the only reason you and me are talking.  You didn't say Alex Jones was at the height of his popularity.  You implied that no one knew who he was a year ago because that's likely when you found out about him.  If you had said "blah blah blah SNL, because Alex Jones is more popular than ever" I would not of even replied.  But you're implying he just became a known person very recently, which is so beyond the truth I don't even know what to say.

       As in, my statement was hyperbole. In retrospect, I definitely could have phrased what I meant more clearly, but I honestly didn't expect people would take it literally, and I definitely didn't anticipate that anyone would be so anal about it. It was an offhanded comment that I made late at night, slightly intoxicated. Sorry for the misunderstanding.

       I seriously doubt HS kids had access yo dvd-burners in 2000. Even if they did have access to them, blank DVDs cost like 15$ back then. Plus the things were so damn slow it would have taken hours just to make a single copy, and BTW where were they getting the media to burn onto the disc? DVD's hold gb's of data - 2000 everyone was still on dialup

       They might have been blank CD's rather than DVD's, either way they were being shared around and the digital files were likewise being passed around on kazaa, morpheus, or whatever file sharing shit we were using back then.  Like I still have old ass downloads of 911 loose change etc.

       Which is what they cost back then - I can't find a source for the cost of DVD's so I used the burner to shoe that technology costs more when it's in it's infancy. There's a geek article from 2001 talking about the debut of DVD-RW which says the new burner costs 625$ and that blank media would be 16$ per disk. The older DVD formats would have been slightly cheaper, but not cents on the dollar like you claim (using only 2017 prices as your basis)

       I wasn't born in 1996 either (it's in the name cuz of the 1996 NBA draft). My name's not bill brown either (cuz I'm not stupid enough to give creeps on the internet my name and birthdate.

       . Unfortunately it's about DVD+RW, not just DVD+R. But the product it's talking about didn't launch till 2002 so it should provide a reasonable estimate for the cost of DVD-R burners from 2 years prior (especially considering 2 years is almost half DVD's entire existence at that point)

       Regardless of whether you believe it or not, you do hopefully see how it
       <em>
        sounds
       </em>
       ridiculous, at least on a superficial level. It also provides a great soundbite for dismissing the conspiracy community as a whole, joining the ranks of "moon landing was fake" and "world leaders are lizard people." I mean really, "Hillary Clinton runs a sex ring out of a pizza shop"... just a few words is all it takes to write us off. And that's not even getting into wild goose chase that was Podesta and his alleged 4chan codes. Pizza related map = pedophilia...yeah sure, that'll really up our credibility. If people laugh at  us, I don't blame them. It doesn't make them "pedo apologists." Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence, and we currently have none of that.

       I didn't claim I had any. Still, your point that some idiots think that there's a basement child sex ring in a pizza place with no basement is a strawman argument, as that is in no way the scope the pizzagate claims.
      </p>
      <p>
       That does not mean in any way that the pizzagate claims are true, it just means your critique of it is invalid.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you want to debate the merits of the actual claims, you might want to talk about Laura Silsby and her connection to child trafficking in Haiti, as well as the allegations against the Clinton Foundation by the Haitian people.
      </p>
      <p>
       You might want to debate the reminiscence of these allegations to the Franklin cover-up or the Epstein case, or the conviction of Dennis Hastert.
      </p>
      <p>
       You might even want to delve into the questionable (although certainly not illegal) nature of Tony Podesta's private art collection.
      </p>

       It's a tangled web of links that produces a coherent image, of which no single node can be conclusively proven, and elements of which may well be untrue. That's a problem, no doubt about it. But to act as though there was nothing to it is disingeuous at best.

       You're contributing nothing to the discussion and just completely ad-hominem ridiculed someone who bothered to acknowledge your argument. 
You look like the fool right now, making the pizzagate idiot's side look more well informed. The presentation of your argument therefore works against what its substance supports. You should delete your comments unless you're shilling for pizzagate.

       It's like I'm living in Westworld on this subreddit. An exact carbon copy of your belittling spite comes into each of these posts and does this exact same thing. They belittle, make fun, derail the conversation and then move on.

       What do you get out of this? Your perception of a pizzagater is already low, do you come here to confirm your beliefs or to make others give up theirs?

       I get why people talk about it, or refuse to talk about it, and I even get the people who are against it. I just don't get people like you, are you just wasting time or do you really feel like you need to do this?

       My spouse loves SVU, and I generally enjoy it as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       When I heard about this episode, I warned her about it. She usually humors me and my "conspiracy junk", but she is now cautioned that I will rip that fucking episode apart the second it comes on in the house.
      </p>
      <p>
       While she chooses to stay ignorant due to having enough stress in her life, she's slowly easing up to this stuff. Pizzagate she'll mock, but if I can get her talking about the Zionist agenda then she's pretty much on the edge of her seat and engaged.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can't think of any time in my life where a "silly idea" has seen this much push back and harassment by people who think they already have the world figured out.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's arrogance. I think we should just go for the shins at this point and post the photos in public places. People can't just got the home button to escape when they're confronted with flyers and shit in the real world.

       You realize that it has a lot of pushback because accusing someone of paedophilia is an extremely serious thing to do and can destroy someone's life, whether it is true or not. Let's also remember a gunman entered the the restaurant.
      </p>
      <p>
       Plus you really shouldn't say that "she chooses to stay ignorant" as she doesn't have to believe what you do.

       Have you ever seen "Wet Hot American Summer"? Does it affect your ability to take Chris Maloney seriously? I always think of him humping the fridge.
      </p>
      <p>
       He's also my only funny memory of this stupid "Night of a 100 Stars" Comedy Central did as a benefit for sick kids or something. Maloney was Star 101 so he starts coming out on stage in spotlight doing jazz hands with a cane and top hat when Jon Stewart orders him to leave. He said once he left SVU he would focus on comedy again.

       Law &amp; Order is for old ladies. They leave it on in nursing home dayrooms and banks. They always have hacky, gimmicky plots about current events that play on the fears of Conservative old people, pander to their social ignorance and reduce complex events to black and white morality.
      </p>
      <p>
       The cops are always presented as saints and subverting the law or planting evidence to convict a "gut" suspect are depicted as righteous and necessary.  Fascist interrogation techniques that create tainted evidence are all they seem to use for dramatic effect and further cement the show's moral slant.  Old people sit there thanking Mannish Mariska Hartigay for protecting them from all those crazy truther creepos they just heard about on Good Morning America with CIA plant host George Snuffaluffagus.

       Probably signal intelligence of some sort.  Like, maybe they are telling others that the FBI started investigating pizzagate stuff.  You can't legally disclose that nor would they want to disclose it.  But, put it in a joke, and you are able to signal others.

       The use of comedy to "neutralize" sensitive topics is one of their most important psychological techniques. As long as we are laughing about some problem, we do not feel the need to do anything about it. Because it is a joke, right?

       In Defense of Minor Attracted People or I Think it's Genocide.
People lived short brutish lives in our ancient history, 30,000 years ago, often dying around age 30. If girls didn't get started reproducing just as soon as they hit puberty, they might not have lived long enough to see that their own children made it to puberty themselves; people had to reproduce early, the species literately depended on it. Therefore, it's no coincidence that the age of puberty is somewhere around half the age of 30. It also explains why there are so many people accused of being pedophiles, that's the way nature has made some of us, to be attracted to youth as a reproductive strategy. But rather than discuss why there seems to be so many “pedophiles”, we chose to just throw them in jail. Truth is, it's the way nature made them through evolution.
We are still running on 200,000 year old software, and no stupid, recently created, feel good, socially constructed laws are going to change that. There was no supportive social services in those ancient times, and young girls who lost their families either died or grew up quick. The ones that were attracted to older men survived, and eventually reproduced. That is why you have girls who like older men, and men who like young girls. It's an adaptive strategy that worked in the past, simple as that. Men taking in young girls was natures answer to a social safety net. 
It also explains why the model industry has such young models, they know men are attracted to youth, beauty and neoteny (look up the word). No one really thought much of it back in the day when Calvin Klein was using a 14 year old Brook Shields as a model. Only recently are people outraged so much over so little. I really think it is so the deep state can use it as a way to control our politicians. Makes you wonder.
Why persecute people for the way nature made them if they are not hurting anyone? No wonder the birth rate in western civilization is declining. Unfortunately, as always, religious prudes are standing in the way of sound reason but try to get your heads around the idea, it's a sound theory. It very well might have made the difference between the human race surviving, and not to acknowledge this possibility is just being unreasonable. The economy has changed but our biology hasn't. There is nothing wrong with being attracted to girls, and boys, around the age of puberty. It's just recently that young people can't find work, and people are stretching their child like behavior all the way into their 30's. 
Throwing people in jail for having an interest in young girls, and boys, around the age of puberty is just predatory policing for money, just like with drugs. Lawyers, politicians, law enforcement types, persecuting people for non-violent crimes that shouldn't even be crimes in the first place, like drugs, which is really just to defend the racketeering of the medical/phama industry, and to prop up their socialist make-work jobs. 
Being attracted to youth doesn't make one a monster, it's the way nature made us. What does make one a monster is destroying the lives of innocent men, and women, who did nothing more than follow their human nature. Not only does it destroy the lives of men when they are taken to prison but destroys the lives of the families, and pets, that depend on them. Think of all the poor animals that get hauled off to animal shelters,and get killed because their owners get put in prison for stupid, non-violent crimes, feeding the prison industry. If I was a cop, I would have trouble sleeping at night for thinking about all the lives I've destroyed. 
Morality is just an abstract concept, a social construct created by parochial minded religious people that are trying to make you submit to their antiquated group think. They often craft shaming language toward you, accusing you of having a “high hope for a low heaven." Evil and morality are points of view. Picture a cat playing with a mouse. To the cat, he is just playing with his food. To the mouse, the cat is the equivalent of evil it's self. This on the other hand, this is not evil; this is evolution adapting people to be attracted to youth as an adaptive strategy. It's the way we have evolved and is why there are so many supposed “pedophiles" everyone is freaking out about. 
This is the realist's perspective who lives by natural law and understands evolution - Life is a question, asked of the Universe, "Is this right?"...and answered by death if it isn't. We literally evolved, through evolution, to be attracted to youth and neoteny to survive! If the trait of being attracted to youth was not beneficial, it would not have been passed on!
 So, every one, stop being uptight prudes, know that everyone is different, and just because you don't like something doesn't mean that it isn't or wasn't at some point a good thing. Older people taking in younger people, as companions, was natures answer to a social safety net, there was no welfare for them when their parents died at an early age. Can you imagine using the strategy that women do today, of waiting 'till age 30 to have kids, back when there was no medical system of any kind, with your teeth rotting out of your heads!  You people are silly for not seeing the obvious truths of our own biological evolution. 
Again, our biology hasn't changed, only the laws, and peoples brainwashed, reactive monkey, herd-like perspectives. Think for yourselves people! We are throwing people in jail for stupid non-violent crimes longer then people who attempt, or succeed, in murder because some stupid politicians were grandstanding for tougher laws that we didn't need. It doesn't even begin to make sense unless you consider it is being used to manipulate politicians through deep-state intimidation. Seems to me some arm twisting like that would explain a lot about the crazy decisions our politicians have made. 
I would say the age of consent of 12, like in Mexico, is about right for a legal cut off.  Nature gave us every thing we need to consent to sex and that is the drive to have sex.  I was a horny little bastard at 12, and so was everyone, of that age, around me.  If you deny this, you are not only being disingenuous with yourself but everyone around you as well. Perhaps your memory is faulty, and doesn't go back that far?
 Do other animals wait for a certain age to have sex after they become able to sexually reproduce? No. It's just as stupid to put limits on it for us after one has reached puberty. People had jobs at those ages 100 years ago. My father would be 90 this year if he was still alive, and he told me that when he was 14 he earned a man's wage reading water meters.  Everyone was younger in the past, on average, than they are now. In 1900, 18 percent of all American workers were under the age of 16. Child laborers often worked to help support their families. In colonial America, child labor was not a subject of controversy. It was an integral part of the agricultural and handcraft economy. Children not only worked on the family farm but were often hired out to other farmers. Boys customarily began their apprenticeship in a trade between ages ten and fourteen. Years ago each child you had made you richer, you could tend another acre of crops. Now, each child you have makes you poorer or if you are too poor to support them, burdens on the system. 
The economy has changed but our biology hasn't. We are keeping young people in school, which is essentially just giving them busy work to keep them out of the real economy, and treating them like kids longer and longer because the economy can't support work for them, as it has all been outsourced due to globalism. The system is all screwed up, and people are too concerned about being called names rather than speak out about the real problems in western society. 
I see a globalist system, which has shipped all our jobs over seas, and implemented silly laws restricting sex WELL beyond the ages of puberty. It looks more like a means of genocide to me. Those people in the middle east aren't exactly having a shrinking population like Europeans in the west are. Yes, the young people are still having sex because they have a high sex drive as nature intended. Nothing is going to stop that but instead of society pushing them into safe, monogamous, long-term relationships, they are making it to dangerous for that. Yes, these elites know what they are doing to us, and have been doing for a long time now. I think it's genocide.

       You realize that it has a lot of pushback because accusing someone of paedophilia is an extremely serious thing to do and can destroy someone's life, whether it is true or not. Let's also remember a gunman entered the the restaurant.

       Have you ever seen "Wet Hot American Summer"? Does it affect your ability to take Chris Maloney seriously? I always think of him humping the fridge.
      </p>
      <p>
       He's also my only funny memory of this stupid "Night of a 100 Stars" Comedy Central did as a benefit for sick kids or something. Maloney was Star 101 so he starts coming out on stage in spotlight doing jazz hands with a cane and top hat when Jon Stewart orders him to leave. He said once he left SVU he would focus on comedy again.
