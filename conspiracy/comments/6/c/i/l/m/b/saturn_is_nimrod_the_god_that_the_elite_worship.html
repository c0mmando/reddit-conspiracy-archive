    <div class="md"><p>This is why Alexander the Great claimed to be son of Zeus-Ammon, in a sense he was. He belongs to the bloodline that came from Nimrod all the way back to Ham. I think this bloodline has mixed with the Annunaki, and this is why it holds great Occult knowledge and rules over the world of man.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Im still trying to figure it out clearly, but I think that the Annunaki lived in Atlantis, or the Nephilim lived in Atlantis, and Yahweh floods the Earth to destroy them. Noah escapes, he is homo sapien, has three sons, one of which was with a female nephilim, named Ham. Ham has Cush, along with other sons, but Cush becomes the father or Greeks, Romans, Babylonians, etc and these peoples mythos tell of how this bloodline existed. Cush fathers Nimrod, who then goes on to fight the Nephilim, his father. The Romans called Nimrod Saturn, and he played his Titan father Uranus.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think Jesus Christ is the Way and the Truth.  I am trying to disregard satans deceptions altogether.  We are two thousand years behind, with layer upon layer of lie.  If we can recognise that it is a lie, that&#39;s enough to turn from it.   </p>

<p>I&#39;ve been spending too much time and effort trying to uncover this stuff myself.  It&#39;s a labyrinth of untruth.  Better to focus on the good and positive I can do before the end.  At least that&#39;s what I&#39;m going to try to do.  </p>

<p>Not trying to dissuade anyone else from looking into it btw.  Do the research, learn.  I&#39;ve seen enough to know only Jesus Christ is the Way and the Truth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree, but we must understand why. Yahweh cursed Ham, and I believe it is because he is mixed with demonic blood. Shem and Japeth&#39;s sons did not mix. Satan promises dominion over this world, but Christ offers eternity in Heaven. Many who descend from Ham have become rulers and dictators, but that is because of their demonic blood.</p>

If it helps, look up the symbols of each of those names eg saturns cube, saturns rings, nimrods tree etc.  They all have symbols or concepts and practices associated with them.  Once you see them you can recognise them everywhere in the world.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think this is also why incest is common among royals, they wish to keep their annunaki bloodlines pure, and by mating with their own they can enhance it. This is why Nimrod married his mother and had a son, Tammuz, who we worship on Easter. Notice how so many ancients have elongated skulls? I think this is indicative of the annunaki lineage. If we jump to modern times, leaders that are also E-V13 like Hitler, Napoleon, Lyndon B Johnson, they all rule over an empire that is similar to these ancient ones. Hitler&#39;s Germany is very similar to the Roman Empire. America is also infested with Freemasons. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is why the Christian Monarchy was over thrown in Russia, and replaced with an atheistical dictator that would use Communism and Socialism to destroy many Russians. It has been an orchestrated movement by these people that has been happening for a very long time. They hired Oliver Cromwell to kill the King of England and allow the Jews back into England so that they could establish the bank of England and practice their Babylonian money Magick, which led to the British Empire, and the creation of America. The Russian Tsar helped the colonialists against these Babylonian Talmudists, by blockading ships, and it is because of this that they punished Russia with Communism. Also because Russia went against Khazaria, which was what forced them into Western Europe. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ive been looking into the Saturnine Black Cube too. I mean if Nimrod is descended from Annunaki, and he is known as Saturn by the Romans, then it makes some sense. Some people claim the Annunaki come from Mars, and built the pyramids to resemble a volcano on it, they are the reptilians. If this is true they may have viewed Saturn as their Black Sun. Or also the asteroid belt used to be a planet,  and perhaps this is what caused them to come to Earth, in order to survive they may have genetically mixed with Homo sapiens. Thus we have Noah mating with one to birth Ham. The myth goes that they cut Nimrods body up into pieces, which is the same as what they did to Osiris, again pointing to the fact that Tammuz is Horus, which I believe we worship as Jesus today.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, I&#39;m not sold on the idea that Jesus is Tammuz, because the stories aren&#39;t consistent: <a href="https://www.gotquestions.org/Jesus-myth.html">https://www.gotquestions.org/Jesus-myth.html</a> That&#39;s just a random site I found explaining the differences in TL;DR format. </p>

<p>I&#39;m obsessed with the cube though. I think we might be inside of one in which Saturn is the supreme architect. It&#39;s a fake, matrix reality.</p>

<p>I also think they&#39;re going to try and lead us all into another cube matrix. A matrix within this one. Look up New Jerusalem, which is essentially &quot;heaven on earth&quot; in the Bible coming down from the clouds.</p>

<p>Rev 21: 15 And the one who spoke with me had a measuring rod of gold to measure the city and its gates and walls. 16 The city lies foursquare, its length the same as its width. And he measured the city with his rod, 12,000 stadia. Its length and width and height are equal.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a damn cube. Or a pyramid. But probably a cube.</p>

<p>And the building of the wall of it was of jasper: and the city was pure gold, like unto clear glass. And the foundations of the wall of the city were garnished with all manner of precious stones. The first foundation was jasper; the second, sapphire; the third, a chalcedony; the fourth, an emerald; The fifth, sardonyx; the sixth, sardius; the seventh, chrysolyte; the eighth, beryl; the ninth, a topaz; the tenth, a chrysoprasus; the eleventh, a jacinth; the twelfth, an amethyst. And the twelve gates were twelve pearls: every several gate was of one pearl: and the street of the city was pure gold, as it were transparent glass.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it might be possible too that the Hyksos were of this bloodline and when they conquered Egypt, Akhenaton the Pharaoh was actually Moses. His daughter Scota moved to form Scotland, and this is why they have red hair. Esau, King David, Judas, all described as being red haired. Perhaps if Noah bred with the daughters of Cain, then Scota bred with the sons. I find that most E-V13 conquerers replace R1b kings who believe in Christ. Notice how all of the royal families of Europe are related, they belong to the same bloodline R1b.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not sure if paths are being crossed here, but I&#39;ll add my thoughts from my studies. Noah was a righteous man and never turned away from God so far that he is called His friend. The flood was to destroy the nephalim and bad guys. I think the Romans due to their symbolic ways wanted to bring people together, they could not use religion as they killed Jesus so they had to bring people in with other means by introducing or mixing celebrations. They worshiped thr sun and other planets. Like how the Greek and their mythical gods. If God yaweh created life, and Adam and eve rebelled and thus the disobedient angel Satan that tricked them, began to dictate and rule mankind, then this is the one who is ruling today. Interesting theory of bloodlines as we all descend from the ancestors and I think one gene from our paternal father always remains so it&#39;s possible but surely if one chooses to act cruel then this doesn&#39;t have to be in the blood</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The bloodline of J is most common today in Jews and other semitic groups, however do not let that deceive you! It is from Shem and therefore not cursed like Ham&#39;s. It is from the North in Persia and has spread throughout the Middle East. I believe it is possible that these are people who had the closest, and most prolonged exposure to the bloodline of E-V13, and other Hamitic bloodlines. That is why the Rothschilds are composed of these two bloodlines. It may even be possible that the E-V13 is using the J&#39;s as cover, mixing with them to hide their cursed forms. 40% of Jews of all groups are E-V13, and in the past many were portrayed as having horns and tails, many of the elite today who are Jewish also continue the practices of drinking blood, spirit cooking, pedophilia, etc. It might be that these reptilian, Annunaki hybrids don&#39;t just psychically feed off of our negative energies, but also devour the flesh of humans, much like a Holy Sacrament. Interestingly enough there was even a Pope who was E-V13 bloodline.</p>
