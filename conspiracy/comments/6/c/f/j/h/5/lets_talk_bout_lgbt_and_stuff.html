       I have a theory of mine. Considering SJW/Fat acceptance/Gender fluidity etc. etc. As far as I know this culture thrives well only in Western countries. In countries where toxication of food, drinking water and air is at its peak. What if all this nonsense is a massive collective chemical throwback of all the fluoride, aspartame consumed orally, of all the aluminium shot IV (Vaccines) and breathed (Geo-engineering) within the past 20 years; of all the mind-changing, strong pharmaceutical drugs consumed prescribed to children in early 2000s, late '90s. Add the fact that we are exposed to enormous amounts of useless digital information resulting in an irritated and unstable mind (smart phones) and you have a formula.

       It's one of their plans to destroy western civilization. By destroying all morals you soften the victim civilization from the inside and make it easier to control. Pretty much like a spider injecting poison on its prey to turn it into mush and drink it.

       LGBT is immoral, but you've been brainwashed to think otherwise.  Just because a lot of people support LGBT, doesn't mean it's moral.  It'll be like saying a serial killer is moral, because a lot of people support serial killing.  Morals are not based on popular opinion, if the majority supports LGBT, then the majority is immoral.

       Homosexuality is found throughout nature and by definition can be considered natural. It happens organically and needs no outside forces. It also hurts no one and is an expression of love which one would think a loving God would approve of.

       God doesn't approve of sin, those who commit homosexuality are just as guilty as those who commit murder in the eyes of God.
      </p>
      <p>
       Homosexuality is unnatural and goes against the natural use of our bodies.  Just because an animal does commits homosexual acts, doesn't mean it's natural, it means the animal is severely misguided, just as human homosexuals are misguided into thinking it's ok.
      </p>
      <p>
       At any rate, humans are not animals and they should be corrected when they do these perverted acts.

       The Levitical law &amp; punishment of the old testament was for the nation of Israel.  We are under grace through faith in Jesus Christ, so if you truly want to be saved, then you must believe in Jesus Christ, turn away from sin and you'll receive everlasting life.  We are all sinners and we all need a Savior and that Savior is Jesus Christ.  Homosexuals can become ex-homosexuals, if they believe in Jesus Christ and turn away from their sin.

       Homosexuality is sexual immorality.
      </p>
      <p>
       1 Corinthians 6:9-10
9) Do you not know that the wicked will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived: Neither the sexually immoral, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor men who submit to or perform homosexual acts,
      </p>
      <p>
       10) nor thieves, nor the greedy, nor drunkards, nor verbal abusers, nor swindlers, will inherit the kingdom of God.

      <p>
       If you commit homosexuality, then you will not inherit the kingdom of God.

       Interesting that the translation is disputed and doesn't seem to appear in that form until the 1940s. Like most of the Bible it appears people see what they want to see, not what's really there.

       Fake sugar. At 80° aspartame apparently turns into arsenic. I don't know the whole problems with aspartame but we shouldn't be having as much fake products in our diets. It's not going to be as healthy for us.

       I think there's a good chance the numbers were larger in the past than we assume. I believe Native Indians accepted hermaphrodites as part of their culture so it was fairly common. And naturally we'd hear more about it during the Information Age.

       No joke.  Look at this Kardashian thing.  It's now perfectly acceptable for men to dress as women, so whole industries (cosmetics, clothing, etc) get to market to a whole new group.  I had a friend who (back before it was all that acceptable) sold vintage clothing on ebay.  You would not believe the prices people would get for larger size pump shoes or boots, vintage underwear etc, as long as the sizes were larger and they were extremely feminine in style.  The names buying these items were almost always "Steve" "Marty" or whatever.  She would tell me all kinds of hilarious stories about it, and she made out like a bandit.
