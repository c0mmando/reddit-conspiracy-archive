        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Kim reached out to Seth after the DNC leaks to offer more help.  This led to the Podesta phishing scam.  Kim is the Podesta hacker.  He knew where to phish because of Seth Rich.  This is part of what made Seth a dead man.  He knew too much and wasn&#39;t gonna stop.  The implication was that there was even more dirt on Hillary yet to be phished.</p>

<p>Was this why Kim gave his mysterious tweets last autumn.</p>

<p>Check the timing folks.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My own theory. </p>

<ol>
<li><p>Seth Rich is not only mad at the DNC for corruption, but he&#39;s put on some sort of probation.  If you look at how much this guy was on Reddit during an election year , I&#39;m guessing that he was not given endless amounts of tasks at the DNC during the primaries. </p></li>
<li><p>Seth reaches out to Wikileaks.  He <em>might</em> only have something small to share.  They discuss a way for him to do something bigger. </p></li>
<li><p>Kim Dot Com or a person in Kim Dot Coms circle puts together a way for Seth to infiltrate the DNC servers from his work station.  Kim makes since for two reasons : </p></li>
<li><p>Kim&#39;s career started off by infiltrating government security in Germany.  From a knowledge standpoint and money standpoint he&#39;s so well respected by people in the various communities - that even people who work for the NSA &amp; CIA admire him (despite his issues with our own government). </p></li>
</ol>

<p>Although he probably understood technology well enough, I&#39;ve never really bought that Seth was an Anonymous level hacker.  The hacking of the DNC emails isn&#39;t the hardest job in the world by any means. It&#39;s a bit silly that they act like you&#39;d need the Russian Government to pull it off.<br/>
However I think that to perform such task from within without being the Head of IT , it&#39;s rather tricky. </p>

<ol>
<li><p>Kim&#39;s experience with MegaUpload and experience post-MegaUpload makes him the perfect person to manager the transferring of DNC files from the US to the UK / Wikileaks. </p></li>
<li><p>My guess is that Kim would want to be involved on some level to maybe give 2/3rd of everything to Wikileaks and then hold back a specific amount of emails (along w/ Julian ) as insurance from an invasion into either of their living arrangements ( and perhaps even a way to become free , although i think everyone knows that neither will truly be free within our lifetime ) </p></li>
</ol>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe the Rod Wheeler stuff wasn&#39;t BS.  Maybe with Comey gone insiders decided to start moving on the Rich case which is the easiest way into prosecuting the Clinton/Obama crimes.  Because if Rich is revealed as the leaker it really really makes the DNC look bad and kills the Russia narrative.</p>

<p>But the insiders were blocked, so Kim is like F it I might go to jail for this but I&#39;m the only one left to kick this off.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>True.  </p>

<p>It&#39;s insane how things can be so easily one way or the other.  </p>

<p>Comey was an insider for the people undermining Trump, so maybe he was keeping anything that Trump was pursuing from being successful. </p>
