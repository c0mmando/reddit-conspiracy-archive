<p><a href="/u/JUSTIN_HERGINA">/u/JUSTIN_HERGINA</a></p>

<p><a href="/u/ShellOilNigeria">/u/ShellOilNigeria</a> </p>

<p><a href="/u/Amos_Quito">/u/Amos_Quito</a></p>

<p><a href="/u/mastigia">/u/mastigia</a></p>

<p>We would like to formally introduce our new mods, as well as take the opportunity to open this thread up to discussion regarding any suggestions that might improve our space here.</p>

<p>In the interest of transparency, we selected the top ten upvoted users in the thread, and then we each submitted ballots based on the <a href="https://www.opavote.com/methods/single-transferable-vote#meek-stv">Meek Single Transferable Vote Method</a>, resulting in the four chosen moderators. </p>

<p>This thread is dedicated to the new mods and the direction of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>. If you have an issue with a specific mod (or mod action) please free to use the &#39;message the moderators&#39; function on the sidebar.</p>

<p>Best of luck to the new mods in these &quot;interesting&quot; times, and to the beautiful people of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, keep being excellent to each other!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not really surprising though considering they went on upvote numbers...I made a post about a s***ing method where if a post has the edit star on it they&#39;ll reply something like &#39;sneaky edit, I hope the mods didn&#39;t catch that&#39;. </p>

<p>And that&#39;s the gist of my experience with that user, they&#39;re probably gonna say I&#39;m still lying about the edit but why would I make such a big deal out of it instead of just deleting it, it was a low vote post with one shitty comment (mine, aside from the replies I got)</p>

<p>Probably ironic that said comment was expressing my frustration about not being able to point out shills. I&#39;m yet to hear a good reason for this, best I heard was it might hurt their feelings...smh</p>

<p>Before you go reporting/deleting this comment keep in mind I&#39;m accusing them of lying about me personally which reasonably taints the users reputation in my view. You can think whatever you want about them. </p>

<p>It wasn&#39;t. First, the user had to be well-established and recognized in the community, with sufficient karma in our sub as well.</p>

<p>The only users that were considered had to be well known by all of us (we&#39;ve all interacted positively with the new mods for many years).</p>

<p>Also, as CH mentioned, mods were allowed vetoes (which were used) to remove any users from the list that we all couldn&#39;t 100% support.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>FTR, a couple of the users in the nomination thread with the highest votes didn&#39;t make the cut. </p>

<p>I feel confident in the temperament and ability of the new mod additions, however, they are still on a trial basis, so mods and users alike should be extra vigilant moving forward.</p>

<p>The public mod log is a really special thing that shouldn&#39;t be taken for granted. By showing each action us individual mods take, it does wonders for transparency and the overall health of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>.</p>

Shit was at an all time low for a reason.</p>

<p>The Ctrl left and alt right are deleting the center. Don&#39;t fucking contribute to that.</p>

<p>That&#39;s patently untrue. It&#39;s happened on a handful of occasions, and usually only after brigades from the front page (when, curiously, 4k active users suddenly appear and flood the comments section with false outrage over a sub they rarely, if ever, frequent).</p>

<p>The front page being filled with Seth Rich posts just when WaPo publishes the article about Trump leaking classified information to Russians isn&#39;t brigading or suspicious and isn&#39;t labelled &#39;unverified&#39; or &#39;false&#39; but a single article that says Trump fucked up again is upvoted on a site where Trump is despised and it&#39;s got to be shills, right?</p>

<p>Seth has been an almost daily topic of discussion since his death. Also, <a href="/u/axolotl_peyotl">/u/axolotl_peyotl</a> and other mods have confirmed that since the last flair mistake, thread flairs are no longer used in this sub except for NSFW content.

<p>This is my all-time least favorite comment in the history of this sub.</p>

<p>Anyone who&#39;s actually read the sidebar and the subreddit rules who <em>still</em> utters this comment is immediately suspect in my book.</p>

<p>Allow me to reiterate:</p>

<p><em>This is a forum for free thinking and discussing issues which have captured the public’s imagination.</em></p>

<p>At the risk of sounding redundant, this forum is <em>not</em> for &quot;discussing ideas which everybody 100% agrees is a &quot;conspiracy theory&quot;.</p>

<p>Why not use the definition that&#39;s already and always has been on the sidebar?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Conspiracy - a secret plan by a group to do something unlawful or harmful
Theory - a supposition or a system of ideas intended to explain something
Conspiracy Theory - a hypothesis that some covert but influential organization is responsible for a circumstance or event</p>

<p>This is a forum for free thinking and discussing issues which have captured the public’s imagination.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But you talk about the sidebar, and in the sidebar it says that posts much have context or they may be removed. It&#39;s clear this is r/CONSPIRACY and we have defined what a conspiracy is, so posts that lack context in the sense of a conspiracy are technically breaking the rules, no? Freethinking doesn&#39;t mean that we should let people make posts here that are journals of their personal life, so obviously not <em>everything</em> is appropriate here (ex: things lacking theorized conspiratorial content).</p>

<ul>
<li><p>&quot;The audience <strong>was the biggest ever.</strong> This audience was massive, look how far back it goes.&quot; <strong>bullshit</strong> I watched it live. It was tiny compared to Obama&#39;s </p></li>
<li><p>Trump told the CIA, &quot;I wasn&#39;t a fan of Iraq. I didn&#39;t want to go into Iraq. But I will tell you, when we were in, we got out wrong.&quot;  <strong>bullshit</strong> He supported it on Stern</p></li>
<li><p>Trump also told the CIA that ISIS would not exist if the US had &quot;kept the oil&quot; when it got out of Iraq. <strong>bullshit</strong>  ISIS has earned most of its cash through robbery, extortion, and oil from Syrian fields, Trump doesn&#39;t have a firm grasp on geopolitics. He&#39;s unfit. </p></li>
<li><p>&quot;I looked at the rain, which just never came, you know, we finished the speech, went inside, it poured then we came outside.&quot; <strong>what a lying sack of shit</strong>. Totally refused by camera and people there.</p></li>
<li><p>Trump claimed 3 to 5 million &quot;illegals&quot; voted in the election, costing him the popular vote, sources told multiple media outlets. <strong>more bullshit</strong> with no evidence, just spewing lies to fit his narrative</p></li>
<li><p>Trump said &quot;Look, when President Obama was there two weeks ago making a speech, a very nice speech. Two people were shot and killed during his speech.&quot; <strong>more lies</strong> <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/salvadorhernandez/trump-falsely-claims-two-people-were-killed-during-obamas-fa?utm_term=.yonw3na2G#.hunov4jNp">No one was shot or killed anywhere near there.</a></p></li>
<li><p>Trump defended his controversial travel ban of people from several Muslim-majority countries in a Facebook post.
&quot;My policy is similar to what President Obama did in 2011 when he banned visas for refugees from Iraq for six months.&quot; <strong>this asshole has not conspectus of facts</strong> There was no ban and refugees continued to be <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2017/01/29/trumps-facile-claim-that-his-refugee-policy-is-similar-to-obama-in-2011/?utm_term=.4ac336acf510&amp;amp;wpisrc=nl_headlines&amp;amp;wpmm=1">admitted to the US under Obama.</a></p></li>
<li><p>&quot;Big problems at airports were caused by Delta computer outage, protesters and the tears of Senator Schumer. Secretary Kelly said that all is going well with very few problems.&quot; <strong>fuck you</strong> <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/tasneemnashrulla/trump-lied-that-delta-and-protesters-were-to-blame-for-the-p?utm_term=.eyY8LmOaQ#.gdWKQAqdO">All the protests were peaceful.</a> Trump is spreading real fake news here</p></li>
<li><p>Trump shared an article with the headline, &quot;Kuwait issues its own Trump-esque visa ban for five Muslim-majority countries.&quot;
&quot;Smart!&quot; the president added. <strong>Actual fake news</strong> </p></li>
</ul>

<p>That was just his first month. He is a con man, He has no moral compass. He said SA was behind 911 and then proceeds to sell them arms which will likely be used to kill Americans. </p>

<p>If the source is so bad. Why don&#39;t you prove they lied? Oh that&#39;s right, you can&#39;t because unlike the real, actual fake new you read, they WaPo and NYT has journalistic integrity.

<p>So both his voters and he was misinformed, and so you give him a pass on flip-flopping? And you think this is a good thing? You don&#39;t care his words match his actions.

<p>For the love of god they shut down THEIR OWN SUB. Not the admin. Th people who run the damn sub shut it down. </p>

<p>What did come out that day was that the PI was a fox news actor who said he was misquoted and actually got all his information form FOX news. Oh and is being sued by the family. </p>

<p>I personally would like to see <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> return to its roots...less politics and more high octane speculation! IMO, the fringe (even the somewhat outlandish material) is what has always made this sub great.</p>

<p>However, this isn&#39;t about what I want (or any individual user). The future of this sub is dependent on the entire collective here. Political conspiracies are perfectly acceptable and appropriate here, but we <em>can&#39;t</em> let them divide us via partisan hackery.</p>

<p>Watching the evolution of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> of the years has been undeniably fascinating, and I remain cautiously optimistic about what&#39;s in store...</p>

<p>I feel you...I personally removed several Seth Rich reposts...however, it&#39;s very typical for the front page to be flooded with similar material when a <em>major</em> conspiracy breaks (the SR thing certainly qualifies). </p>

<p>When this happens, people often do complain, but they tend to not realize that the same thing has happened on countless occasions, and the sub will return to &quot;normal&quot; within a few days.</p>

<p>For example, when the story broke, more than half of the posts on the front page were devoted to Seth Rich, now I count only 4 or 5 out of 25.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a LOT to ask any person/mod to see 2 (or 10) posts about the same topic, read them ALL, follow their flow (did they go OT and was this supported/upvoted by readers), and then decide that some should be &quot;merged&quot; into a mega thread.<br/>
Then, the mod has to withstand people bitching if they disagree with said mods actions!  </p>

<p>It&#39;s not an easy job ... or even a &quot;job&quot; ($) ... so I&#39;m appreciative of all their work. It&#39;s a rough job, and I don&#39;t have time to do it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I disagree with that. What you describe is a tactic other subs and forms of media in general use to minimize certain news or discussions. You may not necessarily intend it that way but in the end it could accomplish that.</p>

<p>I think it&#39;s obviously important to delete redundant posts saying the same exact things but with certain news and discussions there are multiple points and revelations that trickle out. If there are new threads offering something unique about a topic I think those are useful. Just because it is the same topic doesn&#39;t mean it doesn&#39;t deserve a spotlight to discuss it. Again, just so long as it isn&#39;t redundant.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>but we also need to consider that topics get slid and we miss things. this is really why people end up posting things multiple times..or they just don&#39;t notice it&#39;s been posted already. then these posts get upvoted from new and they all end up there. it&#39;s usually just a phenomenon that happens when something major happens...but i think its important to not stop something from getting posted twice because things are sometimes artificially downvoted or slid.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Setting the sort to new has its own problems.</p>

<p>We&#39;re trying to crack down on duplicate posts (as in, same URL) when we can catch them fast enough, but in general, we choose to err on the side of letting multiple posts on the same topic go so that we can allow a variety of opinions.  There is no one &quot;conspiracy&quot; position on any given topic. This can lead t less than ideal situations such as Seth Rich dominating the hot queue a few days ago, but it usually returns to our &quot;normal&quot; after a day or so. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sounds good. I&#39;m not a fan of the fringe content so much, moreso as of late, but this is an conspiracy subreddit after all. In my view, the sub should focus more on evidence and research pertaining to conspiracies that are more plausible, for example: black ops, still-classified black projects, false flags, abuses of power (both corporate and governmental), corruption in general, rigged elections, globalism, secret societies, the elite&#39;s agenda, even UFOs, geoengineering and so forth. I believe these are more deserving of the sub&#39;s attention than let&#39;s say content regarding flat Earth, spurious and unconfirmed sources (i.e. from twitter of 4chan), reptilians, etc. which tend to detract from the sub&#39;s overall credibility more often than not and make the more plausible conspiracies appear as dismissable off-hand for the casual user by association. I believe the more fringe content would be better suited for <a href="/r/C_S_T">/r/C_S_T</a>, <a href="/r/AlternativeHistory">/r/AlternativeHistory</a> or <a href="/r/HighStrangeness">/r/HighStrangeness</a>. On the other hand, to each their own. While these are my personal views on the matter, I would in no way condone censorship of any of the aforementioned subjects, or any content for that matter. Regardless of how the sub continues to evolve (or devolve hypothetically) I will continue support the community as a whole and the sub&#39;s team of moderators, who have objectively done a good job here over the years.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Which reminds of one of the handful of times I tried salvia, which I understand some have found unsettling or unpleasant. For me, it was profoundly grounding, produced a bodily sensation vaguely reminiscent of LSD, and foremost if I were to quantify it or put it into words I would say it were &#39;otherworldy&#39; in the sense that I felt as though I were in the same physical location however experiencing the sensation and perception of another dimension or higher plane of existence, however fleeting and only lasting no more than five or ten minutes per trip. In one of the more profound experiences I had with salvia, I felt as though I were looking into a portal or wormhole and viewing a glimpse of another universe (reminiscent of how one would visualize multi-verse theory perhaps). My skeptical side tends to interpret these experiences as a manifestation of my own psyche and personal beliefs, brought forth by the substance&#39;s novel hallucinogenic and dissociative effects. On the other hand, that feeling was one I can&#39;t help but say I&#39;ve felt before subjectively, perhaps in another life or between lives, and is something I can never forget now that I am cognizant of it.</p>

<p>A link would also be helpful so I can understand where you&#39;re coming from.</p>

<p>Out of the potentially hundreds of moderation decisions we make on a daily basis, mistakes are inevitable (to err is human or something).</p>

<p>And we have a public mod log FYI. If you see a moderation decision you disagree with, by all means bring it to our attention. </p>

<p>This is serious business. If we mistakenly approve any post that violates the reddit TOS, the admins have made it very clear what the repercussions will be.</p>

<p>That being said, the admins have taken a largely hands off approach to <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, and for that we are grateful. It&#39;s going to take all of our efforts to keep it that way.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not the person you responded to but this would be difficult if it had been removed and they hadn&#39;t taken a screen shot.  </p>

<p>Things were being removed or at least buried (shadowed) so as to not be visible on the front page and I know of at least two posts critical of trump were flared with some really weird tags (unconfirmed) during the height of the mod crapola in question.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5n90h5/reports_allege_trump_has_deep_ties_to_russia/">The first link</a> was to a terrible article on <em>buzzfeed</em> about <em>pissgate</em> which is almost universally acknowledged as a hoax.</p>

<p>Notice the <em>17,000</em> upvotes. Regular <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> users recognize how astronomical that is, <em>especially</em> for such an abysmal source (the real <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> users would never put so much weight behind a shit buzzfeed article). </p>

<p>Here&#39;s what happened: While this story was (remarkably) at the top of <a href="/r/news">/r/news</a> and <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> (little did I know at the time how bad the fake news epidemic would become), numerous comments from <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a> linked to this sub in the context of &quot;stupid <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> doesn&#39;t even have pissgate, the most realest conspiracy ever, at the top of their sub!&quot;</p>

<p>As a result, we saw a <em>massive</em> influx of users, and that post, which was lingering in the top 10, suddenly, and artificially, shot up to 17k upvotes, which again is almost unheard of for <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, <em>especially</em> in the context of parroting a &quot;mainstream&quot; conspiracy.</p>

<p>Comments belittling <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> (from users that had never commented in our sub before) started rising in that thread as well, and it quickly devolved. </p>

<p>The decision was made to remove the post, as it did not accurately reflect the discourse and civility that we expect of our users here. The many rule violations in that thread, combined with rational voices getting drowned out and a misleading article to <em>buzzfeed</em> of all places that was getting brigaded by all...</p>

<p>I&#39;m sorry but removing that post was one of the easier mod decisions we&#39;ve made in a while.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5qm9j4/kgb_chief_linked_to_trump_file_found_dead/">As for your 2nd link</a>, this decision was much easier, as it similarly was a shitty link with a paywall (unacceptable for our sub).</p>

<p>This thread was also brigaded by <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> and elsewhere (notice the 10k upvotes). Again, another easy decision for the mods.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5osh54/trump_met_with_russian_oligarch_rybolovlev_on_nov/">The 3rd thread</a> you&#39;ve cited was the most blatant example of all. In fact, I remember watching is occur in real time. When the exact post was trending on <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a>, there suddenly was a call to post it in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, and I saw numerous comments popping up chiming in with support. I remember thinking, &quot;well that&#39;s a thread that will get deleted if it artificially rockets to the top.&quot;</p>

<p>And artificially rocket to the top it did! I <em>personally</em> reached out to OP in this instance, politely asking him to resubmit his post, remove the links to <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a>, and use a more speculative title. </p>

<p>In a predictable hissy fit, he refused, posted my private message as an example of &quot;censorship&quot; and earned himself a ban. For those who have a propensity for drama queenery, please take it to SRD.</p>

<p>The legitimate users and mods of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> refuse to allow the front page of reddit dictate our content. We have always maintained a fierce independence from the rest of reddit, and while we work overtime to follow the reddit TOS, we won&#39;t be beholden to mindlessness of the hive mind. </p>

<p>There have been mistakes made when it comes to flair, and we will try to avoid them in the future. We&#39;re not perfect, but the state of moderation here is far superior to what you insinuate. </p>

<p>Yeah but none of us mods feel that way.</p>

<p>You try sifting through the filth everyday, with a mod queue that can often take 1-2 hours to clean up. </p>

<p>That combined with increasing admin pressure of the last few months has created an incredibly stressful and thankless environment for the active mods here. </p>

<p>For the size (and content!) of this sub, we are <em>woefully</em> under-modded, especially as we approach 500k subscribers. </p>

<p>Also, there is a fairly large turn around for mods here. It can be <em>very</em> stressful, and many mods end up resigning completely as a result. </p>

<p>It&#39;s a double edged sword imo. If they have too many mods, ideology or incompetence is more likely to take place within the mod team when it comes to rule enforcement. But on the other hand this sub is huge. There should be a reasonable number of mods to help keep shitposts, trolls, and spam out of the sub. There&#39;s really no good answer.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the mods of this sub need to set a base standard of what is actually conspiracy-related material, and what is actually consistent with the purpose of this sub. I don&#39;t like partisan bullshit any more than anyone else, but I don&#39;t like the mods determining what is &#39;right&#39; either.</p>

<p>For example, there was discussion here recently about Jeff Sessions talking about cracking down on marijuana, and on this sub, two things came out of it that I felt were inconsistent with the purpose of this sub.</p>

<p>First of all were the posts that were basically news articles from garbage news outlets just saying &#39;Sessions said this&#39;. Shit like that doesn&#39;t need to be here; it&#39;s more suited for r/news or r/politics. Where is the conspiracy in the simple statement? You could say &quot;oh the conspiracy is that Sessions is a whore to private prisons/big pharma or whoever&quot; and you would not be wrong, but are those connections in the article? If not, then what conspiracy is in the actual article? Polluting this sub with those descriptive articles is just simply people pushing an agenda.</p>

<p>Secondly, were the text posts of people &quot;just saying&quot; that Obama didn&#39;t legalise drugs. This is the worst because as well as being descriptive and not analytical, it is just a deflection. No one ever &quot;just says&quot; things. People only ever &quot;just say&quot; when they are implying things, like the &quot;I&#39;m not racist but...&quot;, and to &quot;just say&quot;, and expect people here to believe you is really an insult to the intelligence of the people here. Especially when you only &quot;just say&quot; when news comes up on the &#39;other side&#39; and only &quot;just say&quot; about one person, who happens to be on the &#39;other side&#39;, and not all the other people who did the same thing. Same with any self post that has a point without any sources; it is the same pushing an agenda bullshit that shouldn&#39;t need to be an issue here.</p>

<p>Articles about where Sessions gets his campaign money from; that is the kind of thing that should be here. This ties in to my first point. People on this sub look at todays news elsewhere, so why repeat it here? They already know what Sessions said before they came here, and here should be where people share information on who benefits from what Sessions says, and where the money comes from, and where it goes.</p>

<p>Same with Seth Rich. The face of the establishment is something that can be talked about elsewhere where people buy into partisan bullshit; where people simply describe what is going on. This place should be for sharing ideas and critical analysis of the &#39;why is it happening&#39;, not the &#39;what is happening&#39; to find out what the establishment is doing under the surface.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lol. </p>

<p>The examples were purely partisan. If you judge merely by the users examples, they want a purely partisan mod.</p>

<p>In the initial example, they appear non-partisan, but the links that made it to the front page regarding Sessions went against the r/all narrative of Sessions pushing for harsher penalties on weed. </p>

<p>They don&#39;t want that narrative countered, they merely want it pushed:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You could say &quot;oh the conspiracy is that Sessions is a whore to private prisons/big pharma or whoever&quot; and you would not be wrong</p>
</blockquote>

<p>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Articles about where Sessions gets his campaign money from;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>.</p>

<p>Then they try to link any criticism of Obama to racism. </p>

<p>Then they somehow jump to Seth Rich.</p>

<p>A breakdown of what is ok:</p>

<p>Sessions hates weed. Check.</p>

<p>Sessions is funded by bad guys. Check.</p>

<p>Obama is good. Check.</p>

<p>Obama is bad. Racist.</p>

<p>Seth Rich. You are the &quot;face of the establishment&quot;. </p>

<p>And it is contradictory. If you can&#39;t see that, you may be partisan.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think I get it. It&#39;s terribly worded though and it definitely took me a couple of goes.</p>

<p>The first paragraph I think he&#39;s saying that he doesn&#39;t like people using this subreddit as a back up of places like r/news or r/politics where they can spam theories too crazy for those subreddits. I understand that, I always thought that people who push things like the Russia stuff here <em>know</em> that there isn&#39;t enough evidence for it to be a viable theory but they see this subreddit as a parallel to r/politics or r/news only they don&#39;t need any evidence or credibility. This comes from a fundamental misunderstanding of conspiracies in general as they&#39;re not really used to them. They think it&#39;s just like a news story only more sketchy and with less evidence. You get a good vingette of this mentally in comments saying something along the lines of &quot;I can&#39;t​ beleive they&#39;re not discussing this in <strong>r/conspiracy</strong>&quot;.</p>

<p>That&#39;s just what I took from the first part. No idea what he&#39;s saying when he brings up sex offenders.</p>

<p>The second part he&#39;s accusing the guy of trying to use partisanship as a scapegoat to ban right wing views while allowing left wing views.</p>

<p>A few words of advice: Try to remain as objective and impartial as humanly possible, enforcing the rules where necessary and consulting the other mods whenever you aren&#39;t certain of how to proceed, however while keeping the best interests and wishes of the community in mind. Other than that, try not to take everything too seriously, or personally, and be prepared to tune out the inevitable false accusations, trolling, death threats, etc. </p>

<p>So what do  you personally think <a href="/u/axolotl_peyotl">/u/axolotl_peyotl</a>  of this new direction? Are you going to be staying on as the <em>de facto</em> &quot;top moderator&quot; going forward?</p>

<p>I guess I want to know why, in  the interest of &#39;transparency&#39; and a &#39;new direction&#39; I  guess I would like to have a discussion on the entire moderator list. </p>

<p>No  offense <a href="/u/JUSTIN_HERGINA">/u/JUSTIN_HERGINA</a> and <a href="/u/ShellOilNigeria">/u/ShellOilNigeria</a>, but really? How did 2 blips on my posting radar get enough  &#39;votes&#39; to be a moderator, and what do  you think, do  you think we should be passing out moderator cards to this subreddit based on blind, opaque, unverified <em>reddit  popular vote</em> totals? Do you guys think that&#39;s the best way for a sub such as <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> to move forward, company <em>power mods</em>, really?</p>

<p><a href="http://imgur.com/yM9ivRS">We should have a chance debate this full list and start from scratch for a &#39;new direction&#39;</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>For the last mod election (when I was elected), the mods did a preliminary vote and then a run off vote. This time, I proposed Meek as a way to a) shorten the process by requiring only one ballot and b) ensure each current mod got better &quot;representation&quot; in the vote. </p>

<p>In an alternative system, where each voter gives a vote to each individual candidate, you can end up with a situation where 51% of the voters end up picking all the candidates. With Meek, you&#39;re assured a bit more proportionality, and Meek seemed better than other STV methods out there, especially for a very small pool of voters. </p>

<p>I proposed that we use Meek, and it was adopted by majority vote of the mods. </p>

<p>Incidentally, I can report that there wasn&#39;t really &quot;factionalization&quot; within the mod team. While we ranked candidates differently on our ballots, there weren&#39;t any real consistent patterns as you would expect in say, an election where there were multiple defined parties. That is, the rank of a particular candidate on a ballot was not a good predictor of the rank of any other candidate, at least from a cursory look at them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If by contra-argument you mean it provides a counter point to an argument, no. It shifts an argument to another story. The Soviets used it in such a way:</p>

<p>American/Westerner: &quot;Gulags are bad&quot;</p>

<p>Soviet: &quot;What about your mistreatment of black people?&quot;</p>

<p>In this way, the Soviet is able to dodge criticism by shifting the argument from their use of gulags to the Westerner&#39;s segregation. While it&#39;s true that Westerners did mistreat minorities, that isn&#39;t relevant to the argument at hand (i.e. Gulags are bad). </p>

<p>If by contra-argument you mean, &quot;against argument&quot;, as in, this technique shuts down an argument, then yes. </p>

I like conspiracies, I think they&#39;re fun as hell to research and God help me but there is nothing I love more than falling down a rabbit hole of weird shit.

    <div class="md"><p>I hope this signals some sort of change, but the reality is I don&#39;t have a lot of faith left. </p>

<p>I&#39;m non-partisan but do hang around partisan based subs to hear different perspectives.  I generally don&#39;t participate in discussions in those subs but I do read and formulate my own opinions on subjects. I will never be a partisan extremist however, which is how I feel about about US/Canada politics these days. The US of course being the poster child for extremist political partisan nonsense. </p>

<p>Conspiracy was a sub I used to enjoy. Now it is just another partisan extremist sub. I still come here on occasion to see if the discourse has improved but I&#39;m generally disappointed to see partisan based submissions voted to the top. I&#39;m also fucking sick of seeing multiple submissions about the same topics (Rich, Pizzagate, ScHilary, etc). </p>

<p>Please for the love of god moderate these posts off the sub. Most of them are repetitive and offer no new points of views. Yet for some reason they get upvoted and blow away some really interesting discussions that go beyond fucking American politics. I don&#39;t mind the info, but can we get off the fucking US politics focus these days. It has turned a great sub into a partisan joke with partisan cucks jerking each other off. </p>

<p>For you partisan cucks reading this... fuck off and take your shit elsewhere. This isn&#39;t a political battleground. Stay in the cages the admins designated for you. I&#39;ll even still come visit you. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been on r/conspiracy every day for 8 years and used to post a lot.  But now that I&#39;ve traveled some distance down the rabbit hole, my posts get downvoted immediately and are rarely seen.  </p>

<p>Seems like the sub has lost its bearings...much of what makes the front page is not of much interest to me and so I am spending less and less time here.  Maybe r/conspiracy is destined to be a place for those who have recently woken up and don&#39;t want to go too deep.  It was useful for me for several years, now I get better information elsewhere.  </p>

<p>If I told you <em>where</em> I get that better information I&#39;d probably be downvoted, since, in my opinion, most users here have only begun to pull the wool from their eyes and don&#39;t realize how many of their cherished beliefs are a direct result of an organized plan of media indoctrination over several decades.   </p>

<p>Why even assume at all? Asking is a more efficient form of communication than assumptions. Why are the same people allowed to use such demeaning language, over and over again? We&#39;re not allowed to call people shills. </p>

<p>Second it came out the &quot;&quot;PI&quot; was actually just a fox news actor who said he was misquoted and got all his news from Fox News and had nothing and was being sued by the family.</p>

<p>It was BS from the start and yet its 9/10 threads right now. Its blatant attempt by T_D to distract from the very real shit going down in the white house. </p>

<p>Which seems to be the basis for Fly openly inviting T_D to invade this sub and spread their propganda and kill anything that said anything wrong about dear leader.</p>

<p>That was your inference, not my implication. I literally just said &quot;This isn&#39;t T_D.&quot; I have no problem with the sub. It&#39;s not my cup of tea, but I have no animosity towards its users. It&#39;s just a different culture there that allows and encourages memes, all caps, and header text. We do not here. If you came into a church cussing and drinking, I would ask you to stop and say &quot;this isn&#39;t a bar.&quot; Doesn&#39;t mean I have anything against bars, just that there&#39;s different standards of decorum in each. </p>

<p>If the source is so bad. Why don&#39;t you prove they lied? Oh that&#39;s right, you can&#39;t because unlike the real, actual fake new you read, they WaPo and NYT has journalistic integrity. The buzzfeed was cuaz I was lazy but I&#39;m sure it happened, much of this I have seen with my own eyes. If you&#39;re so sure, prove me wrong. I have an open mind.</p>

<p>So both his voters and he was misinformed, and so you give him a pass on flip-flopping? And you think this is a good thing? You don&#39;t care his words match his actions.
