       We would like to formally introduce our new mods, as well as take the opportunity to open this thread up to discussion regarding any suggestions that might improve our space here.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the interest of transparency, we selected the top ten upvoted users in the thread, and then we each submitted ballots based on the
       <a href="https://www.opavote.com/methods/single-transferable-vote#meek-stv">
        Meek Single Transferable Vote Method
       </a>
       , resulting in the four chosen moderators.
      </p>
      <p>
       This thread is dedicated to the new mods and the direction of
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       . If you have an issue with a specific mod (or mod action) please free to use the 'message the moderators' function on the sidebar.
      </p>
      <p>
       Best of luck to the new mods in these "interesting" times, and to the beautiful people of
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       , keep being excellent to each other!

       All new mods are on a trial basis, so you shouldn't be too concerned.
      </p>
      <p>
       The vigilance of the veteran mods combined with the public mod log do wonders to prevent any potential chicanery or tomfoolery from a rogue mod.

       I personally wouldn't object to you airing your issues here man. I respect your opinion, even if it makes me a little uncomfortable in this specific case. I'm an imperfect human, but I like to think I can stand behind myself.

       I can't promise my post history is consistent, I have drastically changed my mind on a number of things over the years, and will hopefully continue to do so as I learn new things.

       Ya know, there have been several times I have tried to pick your brain because you bring interesting material and perspective. So, I can't say is for lack of trying. Tbh, I didn't know a single username in here until like 6 months ago, when it became more necessary to identify positive and negative influences around here. So, I guess I'm sorry I have never interested you enough to take note.

       While ceddit is useful and we have no problem with you mentioning it, in the future please don't link directly to a ceddit thread. It's not too big an issue in this case, but when we remove PI and link it, it's the same as re-doxxing that person. Thanks

       Not that Reddit as a whole isn't completely fucking gone. The only use I see for genuine old-Reddit are smaller hobby/interest communities and whatever I catch slipping through the noise on here and other free thinking subs. Those are the only areas that have (mostly) remained untouched from the bullshit being projected at the masses.

       some people are pretty attached to their accounts, especially when they mod in subs. also you're technically not supposed to use alts to get around sub bans, though that rule is seemingly pretty rarely enforced by the admins. i guess only when people cause lots of trouble in a sub.

       Sure. It's a PITA. I don't want to get banned either. But if you're afraid of saying anything because you might get banned for it, then what is the point in the first place? None.

       I mean, I agree. But he could post to subreddit drama and not get banned if he were so inclined. Just saying I respect his decision. It's potentially a small amount of effort for little to no reward. Me, personally? Wouldn't​ go though it. Too lazy to make a new Reddit handle, as trivial as it is.

       Well, at the very least you know the rules are enforced. Personally I don't like that rule if it means you can't speak honestly about a person, but whatever I guess. Civility is important.

       u/mastigia gave you permission to actually tell people what you're talking about.. Would that still be against the rules?

      <p>
       Just seems a bit weird you won't go into specifics considering he/she told you to go right ahead. If it's something important the community deserves to know why you think them being a mod is a bad idea.

       It's not really surprising though considering they went on upvote numbers...I made a post about a s***ing method where if a post has the edit star on it they'll reply something like 'sneaky edit, I hope the mods didn't catch that'.
      </p>
      <p>
       And that's the gist of my experience with that user, they're probably gonna say I'm still lying about the edit but why would I make such a big deal out of it instead of just deleting it, it was a low vote post with one shitty comment (mine, aside from the replies I got)
      </p>
      <p>
       Probably ironic that said comment was expressing my frustration about not being able to point out shills. I'm yet to hear a good reason for this, best I heard was it might hurt their feelings...smh
      </p>
      <p>
       Before you go reporting/deleting this comment keep in mind I'm accusing them of lying about me personally which reasonably taints the users reputation in my view. You can think whatever you want about them.

       Talk about a witch hunt. I don't know why PLC doesn't like this guy, but it's certainly not because of any rule-breaking ~info he claims to have.

       It was not strictly based on upvotes. We did take the top ten candidates based on upvotes into consideration, then allowed any mod to have a veto. Finally, we used STV to allow each mod to submit a ranked ballot for the final selection.

      <p>
       Theoretically, vote manipulation in the sub could have pushed out of the running someone who might otherwise have been a good choice, but could not result in us choosing a candidate whom all the current mods did not find acceptable.

       Then it is based on upvotes. If a person bought 500 upvotes, they would theoretically put themselves in your top 10, thus disqualifying a potentially valid candidate from your final round of consideration?
      </p>
      <p>
       Considering the nature of the threats spreading over Reddit, this seems risky.

       Both fair points. Having users buying their way into a mod team could be problematic, to say the least, but seeing as how the current team is highly selective and judicious about who they allow in I don't see this becoming a serious issue, at least not here.

       It wasn't. First, the user had to be well-established and recognized in the community, with sufficient karma in our sub as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only users that were considered had to be well known by all of us (we've all interacted positively with the new mods for many years).
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, as CH mentioned, mods were allowed vetoes (which were used) to remove any users from the list that we all couldn't 100% support.

      <p>
       FTR, a couple of the users in the nomination thread with the highest votes didn't make the cut.

       I feel confident in the temperament and ability of the new mod additions, however, they are still on a trial basis, so mods and users alike should be extra vigilant moving forward.

       The public mod log is a really special thing that shouldn't be taken for granted. By showing each action us individual mods take, it does wonders for transparency and the overall health of

       I actually went thru my history to find the links, it was a bit of work. Then I thought--why is this person completely incapable of looking at flytraps and Cole's stickied posts? It's obvious that you don't want to, or you have already seen the posts, and are being ingenious. Either way, it's not good.

       Any Trump supporters on this website are by default into conspiracy theories as well. You have to be to support Trump because of the massive influence of things like WikiLeaks.

       If they were interested in discussing, sure. But TD is all shitposts, and anyone who disagrees with the circlejerk for even one second gets banned. There can be no dissent. I wouldn't feel comfortable if this sub were filled with people who were OK with that kind of behavior. Free speech matters a lot, no matter what those on the far left and far right may say.

       Come on. I'm not part of your circle jerk and I'm not going to play along. The most hypocritical, censorship-filled subs on this site are r/the_donald and r/socialism, in that order. The latter because they ban people who use the words "stupid" or "crazy" (yes, really)

       You will most certainly be allowed to be critical of the current government including Trump, and Putin. I consider criticism of government to be one of the bedrocks of this sub.
      </p>
      <p>
       What you will not be allowed to do, however, is to attack other users of this sub. This applies equally to Trump supporters as well. This is a sub for discussion of conspiracies and theories about them, not for insulting people who have different ideas than you.

       The reverse is also entirely true and it honestly bothers me more than the Trump shit... At least trump people are real people for the most part... The russia posts... its like they come in with scripts. It's just the same undebatable, aggressive and mockiing speech. And there's no room for discussion unless your agreeing them entirely.

       Both sides are cancer, the Ctrl left and the alt right. Both use bots and have shills. Both sides own the same portfolio's in companies in the tech, defense, and chemical companies. Both benefit from a scorched earth divide and conquer strategy, as their respective media mouthpieces have been losing viewership since nobody had any fucking trust in any media before the election. Shit was at an all time low for a reason.

       That's patently untrue. It's happened on a handful of occasions, and usually only after brigades from the front page (when, curiously, 4k active users suddenly appear and flood the comments section with false outrage over a sub they rarely, if ever, frequent).

       The front page being filled with Seth Rich posts just when WaPo publishes the article about Trump leaking classified information to Russians isn't brigading or suspicious and isn't labelled 'unverified' or 'false' but a single article that says Trump fucked up again is upvoted on a site where Trump is despised and it's got to be shills, right?

       Your suspicions on the timing of the Seth Rich findings is, IMO, unfounded. The original user who was responsible for finding SR's username most likely had no idea about any future or pending WaPo articles; it's unfair to accuse such in reference to a genuine user of this site unless you have evidence.

       Can posts include what exactly the conspiracy is supposed to be? I get that some things are aspects of known conspiracies but on their own seem like partisan BS.

       Why not use the definition that's already and always has been on the sidebar?

       <p>
        Conspiracy - a secret plan by a group to do something unlawful or harmful

      <p>
       But you talk about the sidebar, and in the sidebar it says that posts much have context or they may be removed. It's clear this is r/CONSPIRACY and we have defined what a conspiracy is, so posts that lack context in the sense of a conspiracy are technically breaking the rules, no? Freethinking doesn't mean that we should let people make posts here that are journals of their personal life, so obviously not
       <em>
        everything
       </em>
       is appropriate here (ex: things lacking theorized conspiratorial content).

       It's not that we grass-roots righties think Trump is perfect or without flaws, even major ones.  It's that he seems to be our most powerful weapon against a massive system that seeks to crush us, and so we stand by him, despite his flaws, against the bullshit attacks leveled at him.

       It means free from politics so that's 100% incorrect. Libertarianism has nothing to do with democrat vs republican. It's about freedom of choice and not infringing on other people's rights.

       I disagree. I don't support trump or any other candidate and honestly this sub used to be pretty unbiased about politics. Now it seems people are suppose to pick D or R and argue from designated position.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also trump supporters aren't "largely libertarian". Most so called "trump supporters" just want to be on the team they think is winning. I would even venture to say most actual trump supporters are blind to anything but identity politics and probably have no idea what a libertarian actually is.

       No shilling for Hillary &amp; the dems as if she was a better option &amp; its a deal. I'm pretty sure we would be going through WW3 if she won.  Treating cyber attacks like every other attack.  Additionally - posts that that Jeff Sessions war on drugs shit are bullshit.  Lets not pretend dems have done shit to help.  This is
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">

       .  I thought the general consensus here is both sides are shit.  Democrats can say whatever they want but their actions make them our enemy.  Democrats are no heroes coming to our defense to save us from Trump.  Hes just unraveling what they've done &amp; dems are butthurt &amp; want control back so they can start jamming broken broomsticks in our ass again.

       We need to hold everybody in power accountable. It so happens that Republicans control the House, Senate and Presidency. Criticizing the government is going to mean criticizing Republicans for at least the next few years, and if you think there's a problem with that, you might be the partisan one.

       So both his voters and he was misinformed, and so you give him a pass on flip-flopping? And you think this is a good thing? You don't care his words match his actions.

       I don't trust any politician period. I look at a President, I see his promises, his agenda, his heart and character, and pick the one that align more with my interests.

       People can talk all day but when you're leading the most powerful country in the World you will have to be flexible. Look at the healthcare bill, republicans can't even agree amongst themselves how to replace it. This is the reality of a democracy, it is horribly slow and inefficient and flawed, unfortunately it is the best we can do.

       This is seriously insane, what's going on in this sub right now. I've been gone for a while and came back recently, the difference truly is massive. The amount of people that assume others are Trump users, and then they say shit like, "These idiots should be validated by us!" It's genuinely fucky.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why even assume at all? Asking is a more efficient form of communication than assumptions. Why are the same people allowed to use such demeaning language, over and over again? We're not allowed to call people shills.

       There were people making accusations of Trump supporters before t_d was closed, that aspect didn't change at all. Hell it hasn't even gotten worse, if anything the t_d  situation is being used as validation. All that has to happen is to ask instead of assuming.

       This latest shit show didn't start with the T_D moderator shutdown but with focusing back on the Seth Rich case and people digging out new informations. The shutdown of T_D was a consequence of this.

       Neither does anybody need an invitation to read/write here anyway. As there are mutual conspiracy interests I'm sure a lot were subscribed here or there before anyway.

      <p>
       P.S. Afaik the management of T_D was taken over a few months ago and has probably nothing in common with the interest of the audience of the channel anyway. They are just there as a gatekeeper to chain the "beast"(populous).

       The mods of T_D are who again? That channel is heavily controlled and assuming the mods there to be anything else than gatekeepers is naive. FOX might have gotten the ball rolling "again" after last summer but reddit and 4c people are digging and that caused this panic reaction of the mods.

       This exactly.  Everywhere else on reddit is extremely left-leaning, t_d is extremely right leaning, and conspiracy slams both.  T_d is interesting because it's counter culture (maybe not everywhere but supporting the president would make me a pariah at work) and r/conspiracy-lite.  But conspiracy proper is very refreshing.  Here's hoping the reddit Admins don't force their disgusting agenda in here as well.

       They were never free thinkers. They were partisan to be begin with and were only opposite their chosen authoritarian wasnt in power. They pretended to be anti-establishment when they were very pro-establishment, but just wanted a change in who led the establishment.
      </p>
      <p>
       When this happened, they dropped the facade that they ever cared to begin with and tried painting those against the establishment as enemies of the state.

       If I wanted to throw this thing, I would have a bot set up to read the thread and ensure I knew exactly how many more upvotes my guy needed. Then have bots of human accounts upvote as necessary. At close, I'm guaranteed to get my guy in.

       Yeah, I guess you could have, but you didn't. All the candidates that made it past the veto were users who at least most of the mod team had positive experiences with over a period of years. Had you or anyone else done this, we probably would have nullified that vote, given our reasons, and carried on with a new strategy. That obviously would have hit with some blowback, but we would have done that rather than accept mods that we didn't trust (as far as one can trust internet strangers.)

       But your silence in response to the fucked up mod voting process says all that me or anyone else needs to know. You guys wanted your friends or crew or co-workers in there as mods, so you faked a voting process then used the Mod Veto as a catch all excuse for the trickery.

       Theres an easy way to clear it up... moderators should add all political comments that are off topic (i.e. But what about trump!) to the controversial category and remove them from top,best,new so we dont see the bickering

       I would like less politics, too, and yet....doesn't it remain the most urgent issue of our day? There is obviously an affiliated "political" movement of the two "parties" to crush democracy, dissent and critical thinking.

       That said, if there was a better way to filter out ten posts riffing on the same basic Seth Rich (or whatever) story, that'd be great. I do feel like repetition is clogging up the flow more than anything.

        That said, if there was a better way to filter out ten posts riffing on the same basic Seth Rich (or whatever) story, that'd be great.

      <p>
       I feel you...I personally removed several Seth Rich reposts...however, it's very typical for the front page to be flooded with similar material when a
       <em>
        major
       </em>
       conspiracy breaks (the SR thing certainly qualifies).
      </p>
      <p>
       When this happens, people often do complain, but they tend to not realize that the same thing has happened on countless occasions, and the sub will return to "normal" within a few days.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example, when the story broke, more than half of the posts on the front page were devoted to Seth Rich, now I count only 4 or 5 out of 25.

       It's a LOT to ask any person/mod to see 2 (or 10) posts about the same topic, read them ALL, follow their flow (did they go OT and was this supported/upvoted by readers), and then decide that some should be "merged" into a mega thread.

       Then, the mod has to withstand people bitching if they disagree with said mods actions!

       I disagree with that. What you describe is a tactic other subs and forms of media in general use to minimize certain news or discussions. You may not necessarily intend it that way but in the end it could accomplish that.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think it's obviously important to delete redundant posts saying the same exact things but with certain news and discussions there are multiple points and revelations that trickle out. If there are new threads offering something unique about a topic I think those are useful. Just because it is the same topic doesn't mean it doesn't deserve a spotlight to discuss it. Again, just so long as it isn't redundant.

       but we also need to consider that topics get slid and we miss things. this is really why people end up posting things multiple times..or they just don't notice it's been posted already. then these posts get upvoted from new and they all end up there. it's usually just a phenomenon that happens when something major happens...but i think its important to not stop something from getting posted twice because things are sometimes artificially downvoted or slid.

       How does the SR thing qualify? It was all started because first and formost it was a horrible week for trump.

       Second it came out the ""PI" was actually just a fox news actor who said he was misquoted and got all his news from Fox News and had nothing and was being sued by the family.

       It was BS from the start and yet its 9/10 threads right now. Its blatant attempt by T_D to distract from the very real shit going down in the white house.

       Megathreads can be fairly problematic when it comes to discussing breaking stories which may have new details coming out from different sources. I've seen this in
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics
       </a>
       . The top comment chains are discussing the earliest information, and it makes it hard for new material to get seen.

       Setting the sort to new has its own problems.
      </p>
      <p>
       We're trying to crack down on duplicate posts (as in, same URL) when we can catch them fast enough, but in general, we choose to err on the side of letting multiple posts on the same topic go so that we can allow a variety of opinions.  There is no one "conspiracy" position on any given topic. This can lead t less than ideal situations such as Seth Rich dominating the hot queue a few days ago, but it usually returns to our "normal" after a day or so.

       So one little subreddit in the middle of a site pushing mainstream everything everywhere in a world pushing the very same. It really seems to irritate some that every last bit of dissenting opinion anywhere can't be crushed out of existence.

       LMAOOOOOOO nobody is oppressing your free speech. If some mild criticism of your silliness sends you into a 'MUH FREE SPEECH' frenzy then well, I'd say you are really being a little melodramatic here.

       Can we get a ban or something on people crying about distractions please?
      </p>
      <p>
       All the great "fringe" threads are ruined because half the top comments are always just people claiming that it's a distraction from one of the dumb political conspiracies floating round. Of course that just devolves into an argument and the actual post is barely discussed.

       Sounds good. I'm not a fan of the fringe content so much, moreso as of late, but this is an conspiracy subreddit after all. In my view, the sub should focus more on evidence and research pertaining to conspiracies that are more plausible, for example: black ops, still-classified black projects, false flags, abuses of power (both corporate and governmental), corruption in general, rigged elections, globalism, secret societies, the elite's agenda, even UFOs, geoengineering and so forth. I believe these are more deserving of the sub's attention than let's say content regarding flat Earth, spurious and unconfirmed sources (i.e. from twitter of 4chan), reptilians, etc. which tend to detract from the sub's overall credibility more often than not and make the more plausible conspiracies appear as dismissable off-hand for the casual user by association. I believe the more fringe content would be better suited for
       <a href="/r/C_S_T">
        /r/C_S_T
       </a>
       ,
       <a href="/r/AlternativeHistory">
        /r/AlternativeHistory
       </a>
       or
       <a href="/r/HighStrangeness">
        /r/HighStrangeness
       </a>
       . On the other hand, to each their own. While these are my personal views on the matter, I would in no way condone censorship of any of the aforementioned subjects, or any content for that matter. Regardless of how the sub continues to evolve (or devolve hypothetically) I will continue support the community as a whole and the sub's team of moderators, who have objectively done a good job here over the years.

       I think r/conspiracy should be about conspiracies no matter what the nature...otherwise there should be a political conspiracy subreddit that users are directed to upon posting said material.  We just happen to be living in politically interesting times.  It is really up to individuals within this subreddit to not buy into partisan spats.  We all know the left and right are just a shiny shit show to distract us from their lies...keep reading, keep researching, keep communicating, keep fighting.

Comment has 100 up votes don't care eat this removed because rule 4. Comment has 98 ups and you didn't say any thing about a user or the sub rule 10 buddy cuz you mentioned the orange old dude. It's bad now, not going to get better with these new additions.

       Niiiice. Did that include those things some think of as past and/or future lives, too? Otherwise, the awareness of the artificiality of time is what allows someone to slow it down or speed it up in their present. It's fun to practice doing both, so if it's ever needed, it's easy as pie.

       I should clarify that it was actually 5-MeO-DMT that gave me that experience. I saw the place I had been before birth and remembered everything. I've had many trips but this was special.

       Which reminds of one of the handful of times I tried salvia, which I understand some have found unsettling or unpleasant. For me, it was profoundly grounding, produced a bodily sensation vaguely reminiscent of LSD, and foremost if I were to quantify it or put it into words I would say it were 'otherworldy' in the sense that I felt as though I were in the same physical location however experiencing the sensation and perception of another dimension or higher plane of existence, however fleeting and only lasting no more than five or ten minutes per trip. In one of the more profound experiences I had with salvia, I felt as though I were looking into a portal or wormhole and viewing a glimpse of another universe (reminiscent of how one would visualize multi-verse theory perhaps). My skeptical side tends to interpret these experiences as a manifestation of my own psyche and personal beliefs, brought forth by the substance's novel hallucinogenic and dissociative effects. On the other hand, that feeling was one I can't help but say I've felt before subjectively, perhaps in another life or between lives, and is something I can never forget now that I am cognizant of it.

       i feel like conspiracy is firmly rooted in chaos, the political leanings of the mods should not affect what gets flaired/removed around here. as long as nothing is removed due to political beliefs then i dont care who fucking mods. i just wanna learn and engage in exposing lies wherever they are found.

       Agreed. Moving forward, flair will only be used in rare circumstances, and only on posts that

       Yes, I had a post removed once and two different mods agreed with my argument that it was unjust as stipulated in "

       I got banned from this sub by a certain moderator for bullshit made up reasons because I was highly critical of the alt right and pro trumpagenda being propagated on this sub, and when I appealed to a different moderator who didn't have those same political leaning they realized how bullshit my ban was and restored me. So to act like the political leanings of certain moderators hasn't affected this sub is complete bullshit. I don't want to name names but it was censorship at its finest because my comments went against that certain moderators agenda and it was clear as day why that moderator banned me and used such a straw man bullshit reach of a reason to ban me that was realized by a certain other mod who restored me because how obvious it was.

       As long as someone is not being disruptive, free speech should reign supreme.

       I do think the moderators are often vested with
       <em>
        way
       </em>
       too much editorial power. Case in point - the fucking CEO, "Pez" or whatever, was actually changing shit that customers posted. I cannot believe nothing happened about that.

       I like it when mods stay unbiased and allow open discourse from both sides as long as everyone follows rules. Conspiracies arise from both parties. This subs mods should be free from political bias.

       I get it. You don't adhere to either side, you're crirical of both... or are they all one to you? An illusion created by the deep state to make us think we have control and a choice. You've risen above the two party system and have become a magically enlightened smug soul.

       I was referring to the in fighting in this sub between the two main political ideologies trump supporters and those crirical of trump. Your inability to read into the context of my comment is a strong indication of your ignorance of in fighting in this sub.

       Yea, I'm gonna back down and apologize on this one. I didn't read your post history before replying. I think I just got really frustrated at the persistence of the bifurcated understanding of politics, philosophy, religion, et al, and it made me blurt out.

       I have. When I'm discussing a "controversial" topic with somebody and their comment gets deleted, or comment on a submission that gets deleted, I ask them if they received mail from mod saying why. They are on other user names I'd prefer not to link to. I'll link a screenshot if I must. It's happened several times and it is bullshit. You've come to a conclusion about me that is false.

       This is serious business. If we mistakenly approve any post that violates the reddit TOS, the admins have made it very clear what the repercussions will be.

       Things were being removed or at least buried (shadowed) so as to not be visible on the front page and I know of at least two posts critical of trump were flared with some really weird tags (unconfirmed) during the height of the mod crapola in question.

        The first link
       </a>
       was to a terrible article on
       <em>
        buzzfeed
       </em>
       about
       <em>
        pissgate
       </em>
       which is almost universally acknowledged as a hoax.
      </p>
      <p>
       Notice the
       <em>
        17,000
       </em>
       upvotes. Regular
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       users recognize how astronomical that is,
       <em>
        especially
       </em>
       for such an abysmal source (the real
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       users would never put so much weight behind a shit buzzfeed article).
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's what happened: While this story was (remarkably) at the top of
       <a href="/r/news">
        /r/news
       </a>
       and
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics
       </a>
       (little did I know at the time how bad the fake news epidemic would become), numerous comments from
       <a href="/r/all">
        /r/all
       </a>
       linked to this sub in the context of "stupid
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       doesn't even have pissgate, the most realest conspiracy ever, at the top of their sub!"
      </p>
      <p>
       As a result, we saw a
       <em>
        massive
       </em>
       influx of users, and that post, which was lingering in the top 10, suddenly, and artificially, shot up to 17k upvotes, which again is almost unheard of for
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       ,
       <em>
        especially
       </em>
       in the context of parroting a "mainstream" conspiracy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Comments belittling
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       (from users that had never commented in our sub before) started rising in that thread as well, and it quickly devolved.
      </p>
      <p>
       The decision was made to remove the post, as it did not accurately reflect the discourse and civility that we expect of our users here. The many rule violations in that thread, combined with rational voices getting drowned out and a misleading article to
       <em>
        buzzfeed
       </em>
       of all places that was getting brigaded by all...
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm sorry but removing that post was one of the easier mod decisions we've made in a while.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5qm9j4/kgb_chief_linked_to_trump_file_found_dead/">
        As for your 2nd link
       </a>
       , this decision was much easier, as it similarly was a shitty link with a paywall (unacceptable for our sub).
      </p>
      <p>
       This thread was also brigaded by
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics
       </a>
       and elsewhere (notice the 10k upvotes). Again, another easy decision for the mods.

        The 3rd thread
       </a>
       you've cited was the most blatant example of all. In fact, I remember watching is occur in real time. When the exact post was trending on
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics
       </a>
       , there suddenly was a call to post it in

       And artificially rocket to the top it did! I
       <em>

       reached out to OP in this instance, politely asking him to resubmit his post, remove the links to
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics
       </a>
       , and use a more speculative title.
      </p>
      <p>
       In a predictable hissy fit, he refused, posted my private message as an example of "censorship" and earned himself a ban. For those who have a propensity for drama queenery, please take it to SRD.

       It has nothing to do with your political agenda, and everything to do with the all bold, header-style comment, which is a blatant violation of rule 6 of this sub.

       Rule 6 is not about mean or derogatory behavior; it's written in plain English, and is designed to keep the comments section focused on the content. Had the comment used the name Trump, I would also have removed it had I seen it. I don't even think I read the comment, honestly.

      <p>
       That was your inference, not my implication. I literally just said "This isn't T_D." I have no problem with the sub. It's not my cup of tea, but I have no animosity towards its users. It's just a different culture there that allows and encourages memes, all caps, and header text. We do not here. If you came into a church cussing and drinking, I would ask you to stop and say "this isn't a bar." Doesn't mean I have anything against bars, just that there's different standards of decorum in each.

       Yeah but none of us mods feel that way.

       You try sifting through the filth everyday, with a mod queue that can often take 1-2 hours to clean up.
      </p>
      <p>
       That combined with increasing admin pressure of the last few months has created an incredibly stressful and thankless environment for the active mods here.
      </p>
      <p>
       For the size (and content!) of this sub, we are
       <em>
        woefully
       </em>
       under-modded, especially as we approach 500k subscribers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, there is a fairly large turn around for mods here. It can be
       <em>
        very
       </em>
       stressful, and many mods end up resigning completely as a result.

       It's a double edged sword imo. If they have too many mods, ideology or incompetence is more likely to take place within the mod team when it comes to rule enforcement. But on the other hand this sub is huge. There should be a reasonable number of mods to help keep shitposts, trolls, and spam out of the sub. There's really no good answer.

       I think the mods of this sub need to set a base standard of what is actually conspiracy-related material, and what is actually consistent with the purpose of this sub. I don't like partisan bullshit any more than anyone else, but I don't like the mods determining what is 'right' either.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example, there was discussion here recently about Jeff Sessions talking about cracking down on marijuana, and on this sub, two things came out of it that I felt were inconsistent with the purpose of this sub.
      </p>
      <p>
       First of all were the posts that were basically news articles from garbage news outlets just saying 'Sessions said this'. Shit like that doesn't need to be here; it's more suited for r/news or r/politics. Where is the conspiracy in the simple statement? You could say "oh the conspiracy is that Sessions is a whore to private prisons/big pharma or whoever" and you would not be wrong, but are those connections in the article? If not, then what conspiracy is in the actual article? Polluting this sub with those descriptive articles is just simply people pushing an agenda.
      </p>
      <p>
       Secondly, were the text posts of people "just saying" that Obama didn't legalise drugs. This is the worst because as well as being descriptive and not analytical, it is just a deflection. No one ever "just says" things. People only ever "just say" when they are implying things, like the "I'm not racist but...", and to "just say", and expect people here to believe you is really an insult to the intelligence of the people here. Especially when you only "just say" when news comes up on the 'other side' and only "just say" about one person, who happens to be on the 'other side', and not all the other people who did the same thing. Same with any self post that has a point without any sources; it is the same pushing an agenda bullshit that shouldn't need to be an issue here.
      </p>
      <p>
       Articles about where Sessions gets his campaign money from; that is the kind of thing that should be here. This ties in to my first point. People on this sub look at todays news elsewhere, so why repeat it here? They already know what Sessions said before they came here, and here should be where people share information on who benefits from what Sessions says, and where the money comes from, and where it goes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Same with Seth Rich. The face of the establishment is something that can be talked about elsewhere where people buy into partisan bullshit; where people simply describe what is going on. This place should be for sharing ideas and critical analysis of the 'why is it happening', not the 'what is happening' to find out what the establishment is doing under the surface.

       Not contradictory. He means that mods shouldn't determine what is conspiracy related based on partisanship, but that absolutely should determine what is conspiracy related and what is simply partisan agenda posting.

       The examples were purely partisan. If you judge merely by the users examples, they want a purely partisan mod.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the initial example, they appear non-partisan, but the links that made it to the front page regarding Sessions went against the r/all narrative of Sessions pushing for harsher penalties on weed.
      </p>
      <p>
       They don't want that narrative countered, they merely want it pushed:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        You could say "oh the conspiracy is that Sessions is a whore to private prisons/big pharma or whoever" and you would not be wrong
       </p>
      </blockquote>

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Articles about where Sessions gets his campaign money from;
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Then they try to link any criticism of Obama to racism.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then they somehow jump to Seth Rich.
      </p>
      <p>
       A breakdown of what is ok:
      </p>
      <p>
       Sessions hates weed. Check.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sessions is funded by bad guys. Check.
      </p>
      <p>
       Obama is good. Check.
      </p>
      <p>
       Obama is bad. Racist.
      </p>
      <p>
       Seth Rich. You are the "face of the establishment".
      </p>
      <p>
       And it is contradictory. If you can't see that, you may be partisan.

      </p>
      <p>
       The user doesn't want us to know that r/news and r/politics, where they post non-stop, is full of shit and really wishes we wouldn't post the truth.

       I think I get it. It's terribly worded though and it definitely took me a couple of goes.
      </p>
      <p>
       The first paragraph I think he's saying that he doesn't like people using this subreddit as a back up of places like r/news or r/politics where they can spam theories too crazy for those subreddits. I understand that, I always thought that people who push things like the Russia stuff here
       <em>
        know
       </em>
       that there isn't enough evidence for it to be a viable theory but they see this subreddit as a parallel to r/politics or r/news only they don't need any evidence or credibility. This comes from a fundamental misunderstanding of conspiracies in general as they're not really used to them. They think it's just like a news story only more sketchy and with less evidence. You get a good vingette of this mentally in comments saying something along the lines of "I can't​ beleive they're not discussing this in
       <strong>
        r/conspiracy
       </strong>
       ".
      </p>
      <p>
       That's just what I took from the first part. No idea what he's saying when he brings up sex offenders.
      </p>
      <p>
       The second part he's accusing the guy of trying to use partisanship as a scapegoat to ban right wing views while allowing left wing views.

       Huh. Thanks for that. I don't really disagree with the first part other than I don't know what it has to do with what was being said.
      </p>
      <p>
       The second part, I kind of figured that's where he was coming from, which is what I was trying to say
       <em>
        wasn't
       </em>
       what the guy was doing... but then the convo went off the rails, so fuck it.

       We won't be taking any steps to demarcate the boundaries for acceptable discussion on this subreddit; such a mentality is paternalistic, outdated, and perhaps even a bit sinister.
      </p>
      <p>
       In a space that is curated organically by the community such as this one, mods are only janitors are do not serve, under any circumstances, to facilitate censorship based on the topic of discussion.
      </p>
      <p>
       For you to suggest such a thing is a slap in the face to the fundamental maxim of this subreddit; wherein an ardent commitment to the free exchange of information is buttressed by a prima facie rejection of exactly what you suggest.

       On a semi-serious note, I see all those accounts somehow managed to be in the green with me on RES, so that's a good sign, at least. One even managed to acquire no less than 290 of my upvotes, over the years. Kudos, again, for that.

       A few words of advice: Try to remain as objective and impartial as humanly possible, enforcing the rules where necessary and consulting the other mods whenever you aren't certain of how to proceed, however while keeping the best interests and wishes of the community in mind. Other than that, try not to take everything too seriously, or personally, and be prepared to tune out the inevitable false accusations, trolling, death threats, etc.

       I guess I want to know why, in  the interest of 'transparency' and a 'new direction' I  guess I would like to have a discussion on the entire moderator list.
      </p>
      <p>
       No  offense
       <a href="/u/JUSTIN_HERGINA">
        /u/JUSTIN_HERGINA
       </a>
       and
       <a href="/u/ShellOilNigeria">
        /u/ShellOilNigeria
       </a>
       , but really? How did 2 blips on my posting radar get enough  'votes' to be a moderator, and what do  you think, do  you think we should be passing out moderator cards to this subreddit based on blind, opaque, unverified
       <em>
        reddit  popular vote
       </em>
       totals? Do you guys think that's the best way for a sub such as
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       to move forward, company
       <em>
        power mods

       , really?

       Here's a thought to help with the political stuff: Over in r/neutralpolitics, if you make a claim, you have to post a source link. Maybe that should apply to posts/comments about politics unless they're of a "what if" variety.
      </p>
      <p>
       No idea if it would help or could be
       <em>
        part

       of a solution. The stickied post on what the sub used to look like was a real eye-opener, though and I wish you luck getting it back to that.

       Speak the truth. I long for the days of Flat Earth Conspiracies, but every "conspiracy" on here seems to be about Trump or Seth. Don't get me wrong I want to see his killer found, but I want a variety of actual conspiracy not just politics.

       What? Meeks is a single transferrable vote system for selecting multiple seats. The "single" part refers to each voter getting one vote, which is then transferred (in whole or in part) to the next ranked candidate if the higher ranked candidate is elected or eliminated.

       What was mod discussion like re: selecting MSTVM? Would be curious which other methods were considered and which made it to final rounds of consideration.

       For the last mod election (when I was elected), the mods did a preliminary vote and then a run off vote. This time, I proposed Meek as a way to a) shorten the process by requiring only one ballot and b) ensure each current mod got better "representation" in the vote.
      </p>
      <p>
       In an alternative system, where each voter gives a vote to each individual candidate, you can end up with a situation where 51% of the voters end up picking all the candidates. With Meek, you're assured a bit more proportionality, and Meek seemed better than other STV methods out there, especially for a very small pool of voters.
      </p>
      <p>
       I proposed that we use Meek, and it was adopted by majority vote of the mods.
      </p>
      <p>
       Incidentally, I can report that there wasn't really "factionalization" within the mod team. While we ranked candidates differently on our ballots, there weren't any real consistent patterns as you would expect in say, an election where there were multiple defined parties. That is, the rank of a particular candidate on a ballot was not a good predictor of the rank of any other candidate, at least from a cursory look at them.

       If by contra-argument you mean it provides a counter point to an argument, no. It shifts an argument to another story. The Soviets used it in such a way:
      </p>
      <p>
       American/Westerner: "Gulags are bad"
      </p>
      <p>
       Soviet: "What about your mistreatment of black people?"
      </p>
      <p>
       In this way, the Soviet is able to dodge criticism by shifting the argument from their use of gulags to the Westerner's segregation. While it's true that Westerners did mistreat minorities, that isn't relevant to the argument at hand (i.e. Gulags are bad).
      </p>
      <p>
       If by contra-argument you mean, "against argument", as in, this technique shuts down an argument, then yes.

       Rule 5 and 10 needs better enforcement (especially against concern trolling/tone policing and those emotional baiting posts I've seen regularly pop up against other users ['triggered'] ).
      </p>
      <p>
       That alone would improve things dramatically.

       Genuine question: how the hell does this sub go from regular posts of 2-5k down to regulars of around 100-500? That makes no sense to me. Just a couple of months ago we were much more active. Are we being suppressed or something? I find it hard to believe that that many active users just up and left

       A lot of us have left, or been banned. It's hard to keep coming back to a place that only allows criticism of the current gov when a story is too big to supress.

       Judging by their posts , they seem non-biased and all-conspiracies oriented enough.
      </p>
      <p>
       I on the other hand will reserve my right to be somewhat biased in the most non-invasive way possible. A good reasonable argument is a way to personal growth.

       I'd like to see the option to downvote removed.
       <br/>
       Only upvoting allowed.
       <br/>
       I think people often modify their comments a bit to appease others out of fear of going negative. It may be an irrational fear but I think it definitely does exist and does result in people not saying exactly what they really think.

       I have a question.  I like conspiracies, I think they're fun as hell to research and God help me but there is nothing I love more than falling down a rabbit hole of weird shit.  That being said, I've been wary of replying much in here or even subbing because I've seen stories of people getting banned because they've posted on SRD or in anti Trump places.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is that going to happen to me?  Because if so, I can just keep lurking.  But if not, I'd like to actually be a member of the community.  I just want to know.

       Continue to allow people to express themselves freely. That's all I want out of this sub. When I make an observation, I don't want to be banned for it, even if it is not a politically correct observation. So much of Reddit is dominated by small-minded liberals with a restrictive, prohibitive social agenda. Words are not crimes. The expression of opinion is called free speech, and it should be both protected and encouraged. If it offends some quivering snowflake, so what? That's not a crime, either, not in any sane nation.

       I hope this signals some sort of change, but the reality is I don't have a lot of faith left.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm non-partisan but do hang around partisan based subs to hear different perspectives.  I generally don't participate in discussions in those subs but I do read and formulate my own opinions on subjects. I will never be a partisan extremist however, which is how I feel about about US/Canada politics these days. The US of course being the poster child for extremist political partisan nonsense.
      </p>
      <p>
       Conspiracy was a sub I used to enjoy. Now it is just another partisan extremist sub. I still come here on occasion to see if the discourse has improved but I'm generally disappointed to see partisan based submissions voted to the top. I'm also fucking sick of seeing multiple submissions about the same topics (Rich, Pizzagate, ScHilary, etc).
      </p>
      <p>
       Please for the love of god moderate these posts off the sub. Most of them are repetitive and offer no new points of views. Yet for some reason they get upvoted and blow away some really interesting discussions that go beyond fucking American politics. I don't mind the info, but can we get off the fucking US politics focus these days. It has turned a great sub into a partisan joke with partisan cucks jerking each other off.
      </p>
      <p>
       For you partisan cucks reading this... fuck off and take your shit elsewhere. This isn't a political battleground. Stay in the cages the admins designated for you. I'll even still come visit you.

       To me, cuck is applicable to all partisan meatheads.  They are cucked by their political biases and toeing the line.  I'm using that term at this point in time since it is popular fodder for these clowns to call each other cucked, when the irony is, they are all cucked.

       I've been on r/conspiracy every day for 8 years and used to post a lot.  But now that I've traveled some distance down the rabbit hole, my posts get downvoted immediately and are rarely seen.
      </p>
      <p>
       Seems like the sub has lost its bearings...much of what makes the front page is not of much interest to me and so I am spending less and less time here.  Maybe r/conspiracy is destined to be a place for those who have recently woken up and don't want to go too deep.  It was useful for me for several years, now I get better information elsewhere.
      </p>
      <p>
       If I told you
       <em>
        where
       </em>
       I get that better information I'd probably be downvoted, since, in my opinion, most users here have only begun to pull the wool from their eyes and don't realize how many of their cherished beliefs are a direct result of an organized plan of media indoctrination over several decades.

       I have posted a legitimate conspiracy regarding an Alien Being. It was removed twice today. The story of the "Dover Demon" actually ran in newspapers and was even seen by law enforcement officers. It is an excellent conspiracy that will not be shared with others. I feel I contribute to this sub on a very large basis. It is unfair that people can be censored.

       This is seriously insane, what's going on in this sub right now. I've been gone for a while and came back recently, the difference truly is massive. The amount of people that assume others are Trump users, and then they say shit like, "These idiots should be validated by us!" It's genuinely fucky.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why even assume at all? Asking is a more efficient form of communication than assumptions. Why are the same people allowed to use such demeaning language, over and over again? We're not allowed to call people shills.

       After the veto process, we had a list of candidates. Each mod ranked the candidates in order of preference; most mods ranked all six but some did not. Then we used freely available software to count the votes and choose 4 new mods.

       How does the SR thing qualify? It was all started because first and formost it was a horrible week for trump.

       Second it came out the ""PI" was actually just a fox news actor who said he was misquoted and got all his news from Fox News and had nothing and was being sued by the family.
      </p>

       It was BS from the start and yet its 9/10 threads right now. Its blatant attempt by T_D to distract from the very real shit going down in the white house.
      </p>
      <p>
       Which seems to be the basis for Fly openly inviting T_D to invade this sub and spread their propganda and kill anything that said anything wrong about dear leader.

       Rule 6 is not about mean or derogatory behavior; it's written in plain English, and is designed to keep the comments section focused on the content. Had the comment used the name Trump, I would also have removed it had I seen it. I don't even think I read the comment, honestly.

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       That was your inference, not my implication. I literally just said "This isn't T_D." I have no problem with the sub. It's not my cup of tea, but I have no animosity towards its users. It's just a different culture there that allows and encourages memes, all caps, and header text. We do not here. If you came into a church cussing and drinking, I would ask you to stop and say "this isn't a bar." Doesn't mean I have anything against bars, just that there's different standards of decorum in each.

       If the source is so bad. Why don't you prove they lied? Oh that's right, you can't because unlike the real, actual fake new you read, they WaPo and NYT has journalistic integrity. The buzzfeed was cuaz I was lazy but I'm sure it happened, much of this I have seen with my own eyes. If you're so sure, prove me wrong. I have an open mind.

       So both his voters and he was misinformed, and so you give him a pass on flip-flopping? And you think this is a good thing? You don't care his words match his actions.
