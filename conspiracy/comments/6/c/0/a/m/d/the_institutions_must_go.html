        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>It&#39;s the only way out of this mess. Our institutions are rotten to their very core. There has been a lot of useless protesting going on, and I don&#39;t necessarily think that&#39;s a bad thing even if they are funded by George Soros. However, protesting is fucking useless. It&#39;s a glorified Facebook status. It makes us feel warm and fuzzy when we express ourselves and our peers like it. We form common bonds with our fellow man through struggling against a perceived common enemy. As far as I can tell, the only enemy we are currently facing are institutions and bureaucracy. Nothing is going to get fixed unless we demand it. There is no politician that is going to save us. No one is going to save you, except for you. Now there are plenty of ways to go about revolution, but if we want one that will last it needs to be peaceful. With all the protesting of Trump going on all we really have to do is unite under one banner, and march on DC. And not just march, but arrest the politicians. All of them. At this point we will suspend all activities in the US until we come to an agreement about how the way things are going to work. We need a new constitution written. I like the idea of healthcare as a right. Housing and food as well. Ya know, the things you need to live. I know some people will say how are we going to pay for it, but maybe, just maybe we should stop thinking about money. The elites want us to think like that because they control the money supply. I don&#39;t have all the answers, nor would I ever claim to. I have a lot to learn, we all do, but the one thing I do know is that we are running out of time. Do you think soldiers would shoot at their own fellow citizens who are trying to take down the same people who don&#39;t pay them veteran benefits? Maybe, but some of us will probably have to die if we actually want change. Of course, the elites will still have some tricks up their sleeves, but there are good people inside of all institutions who will hopefully make the right decision. The elites attempted a coup when they thought FDR was going to smash facism in the 30&#39;s, but General Smeadley Butler ratted them out. There is no future on this planet unless we act soon. Thoughts? Have I communicated this vision clearly? We can do this, we all just have to choose it together.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, music is very important. I have a good idea for a song right now my friend and I are working on. The only thing that worries me about social media is the rampant censorship that goes on there. I get tons of likes on Facebook if I post a snarky quip about something, but anytime I post a news story from Project Censored it gets no love. I&#39;ve asked my friends about it, and they just looked at me confused and said that they have never seen me post anything from Project Censored. But I suppose it&#39;s always worth a shot.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As a former government employee, I agree and disagree with you.  Most of the government are seriously just regular people.  The ones that you are railing against - the ones that have the most power - are the ELECTED and APPOINTED people.  That has seriously become animal farm and some people are more equal than others - they make a shit ton, and they are all corrupt (this is what I know from the news, I have no personal experience with this).</p>

<p>My point is not all institutions must go.  Do you really think your local post man is part of the deep state?  That is the majority of government.  But the corruption we have allowed in Congress, the DoD, etc. is what we need to focus on.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think your not understanding my point.  &quot;All institutions must go&quot; means most of the regular people.  It&#39;s people in Washington you are talking about.

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, that is what I was trying to say.  Also - I gotta say - government does come with it&#39;s pitfalls since often Congress sets idiotic rules we have to follow and have no chance of changing (which is not true of private businesses).  But generally speaking, when they get rid of government employees - all that money goes to contractors and you get less for more.  Those fuckers are pretty corrupt too.  Probably their company gets hired because they&#39;re buddies with some Congressman.</p>
