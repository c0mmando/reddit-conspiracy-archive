       I'm pretty sure he's already looking into the case, but I don't think he's said anything in public about it yet? Anyways, I am pretty sure he looks at this subreddit, so maybe there is a chance he'll see this.

       But in another thread you said that Paul Ryan's Russian joke could be the smoking gun that impeaches trump so either you're an idiot that has no idea how laws work or you think Ryan's comment along with other evidence will be enough to impeach. I mean surely you can't think a third party comment is enough for impeachment...can you?
Hopefully they'll both be in prison.

       How can someone be this willfully naive. You believe the woman has enough powerful globalist elite ties to arrange well orchestrated murders and then sweep them under the carpet without any difficulty, but you think even if she were found to be responsible for Rich's murder that she wouldn't be protected or just leave the country?
      </p>
      <p>
       It amazes me how people on here talk about how all-powerful these elitist groups of shadow politicians are, but still believe the American justice system is going to come through for them and catch the bad guy and restore order to the world. It's such a weird dichotomy of thoughts.

Not all potheads are shitty though. I have a full time job, go to college, have a kid and I'm married and I get high everyday.

       I've noticed that most of the people that are against weed simply haven't tried it. While it may be harmful in some ways, in others it's actually beneficial. Try it before you judge and even if you don't like it, don't be a dick. Not every needs to conform to your standards.

       It's not a what about argument. You're right, they could be reading the sub too, but I am saying it is also blatantly a network for propoganda. That's not mutually exclusive sure, but it is very relevant. Labeling it a "whatabout" argument is completely incorrect.

       Serious question: If he was the leaker and he was murdered because of this, wouldn't the Russians be the ones most likely to have arranged the murder? There are strong ties to the leaks and Russians, and also the Russians are known to kill their opponents or key players in their operations as a coverup.
      </p>
      <p>
       The DNC does not have a reputation for murder, and the only possible link with DNC and murder is with Bill decades ago.

       The Russians would have him killed to clean up after themselves; to tie up loose ends. Maybe he was about to expose them. The only reason the DNC would have to kill him is for vengeance, and they probably wouldn't risk that, since this is not their typical behavior. I don't think it would send a message or anything like that.

       Russians killed Seth to avoid exposure? Lol! Why bother killing when they're blamed six ways from Sunday for everything that goes wrong in our country without a shred of evidence? They have been cast as the US' boogeyman and it makes no sense for them to kill to avoid the accusations that were already coming from a mile away.

       I think it's more likely they killed him to tie up any loose ends. The DNC has no reported record of killing people, and why would they risk the exposure just to get back at someone? "I'm mad at you so I'll kill you.", that's stuff in movies, executions only happen for a reason, and if the DNC did it, it would be to send a message, and I don't think that was an effective way of doing it.

       well, lets just play devils advocate here. Lets say Rich was the source of leaks. Well, we know Putin likes to tie up loose ends:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Two of the recent victims, Oleg Erovinkin and Alex Oronov, have been described by Russian analysts as possibly connected to a dossier written by a former British spy about Trump and his campaign staff’s alleged collusion with Russian efforts to interfere in the 2016 presidential election.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2017/05/02/dozens-russian-deaths-cast-suspicion-vladimir-putin/100480734/">
        https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2017/05/02/dozens-russian-deaths-cast-suspicion-vladimir-putin/100480734/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       So lets say the Russians did what they are best at, human intel, and got Rich to hack and then leak DNC emails somehow (maybe he was indeed a Sanders supporter and they played on that, maybe a Honeypot was involved, perhaps they simply convinced him to place a usb with an exploit in a server, who knows).
      </p>
      <p>
       Once he got the info out, they killed him, like they killed all the people in the link above. They would have known there was enormous tension between Sanders and Clinton supporters and of course that there is an entire "Clinton body count" conspiracy. The murder would play into that while misdirecting from their own actions​ and eliminating the only person who could say for sure what happened, Seth Rich.

       It doesn't involve Byzantine plots with secret assasins, unknown motives, clandestine hacking, elaborate cover-ups and intimidation across multiple organizations.
      </p>
      <p>
       Muggings happen all the time, particularly in bad neighborhoods, muggers generally dont expect a fight (which forensics found signs of on Rich) and it makes sense a mugger would panic and run after realizing theyd just shot someone.

       Yes lived on Euclid just down the street from Seth. Granted, it was 17 years ago. But the mosaic of evidence paints a different picture.  The investigation seemed to end with "botched robbery". DC is the most survelied, security cam city in the country. Release the cam footage. Release the metadata from Seth's phone. Where was he for over 2 hours between leaving Lou's and getting shot on 2200 and Flagler? Was there an effort to resuscitate him after he was stabilized and designated VIP status at Howard university at 6am in the morning? Address the anomalies if you want to give me that simple answer.

       Well, again, playing devil's advocate again:
      </p>
      <p>
       1)  In this scenario Rich does not have and innate desire to access the emails. He is induced to do it by others
      </p>
      <p>
       2) Any number of ways. Russian spies are in DC. They are renowned for human intelligence. They could have just trolled around at political events, bars etc for someone to flip in the DNC.
      </p>
      <p>
       3) The agents may not have been obviously Russian. They could very well have impersonated someone else - US law enforcement, the Sanders campaign (there is btw, no hard evidence Seth was a Bernie supporter). There could have been sex, blackmail or money involved. People act as spies for any number of reasons.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am playing devil's advocate, but there's as much to this theory as there is to Seth somehow independently accessing the email data vase, leaking to WikiLeaks and
       <em>
        then
       </em>
       DNC somehow finding his identity and, after he'd leaked, assassinating him.

       That is totally unrelated to this. So, as a separate topic, I don't want police snooping around my house either, and I don't break the law. But neither does someone who breaks the law. So it might be a small hint of wrongdoing, you can't use that fact alone as they did something wrong.

       Why wouldn't the DNC let the FBI investigate their servers? Why won't they also produce the evidence of how the Russians hacked their servers? They just kept saying the Russians hacked their servers and never produced any evidence. If someone were to prove that the putting of the blame on the Russians was false then that certainly proves that there is something fishy going on in the DNC. The fact that they won't produce any evidence while making a substantial claim, especially one that could have international ramifications. There is evidence to support that there was foul play at the DNC during the primary process which was one that caused most of this Russian hacking narrative.

       No need to call me a looney because you disagree with me. There was no conspiracy mentioned in the OP just calling for the president (who I thought being at the top level of government r/conpiracy would be highly suspicious of) to jail someone. You even only need to look at his name to see hes pushing an agenda.

       Trump isn't gonna do shit about Clinton... when it's election season again he'll go back to pretending he's gonna "lock her up" to give his fans something to cheer about because he has no agenda accomplishments to point to but it'll just be empty words again.

       Questions about your hypothetical:
      </p>
      <p>
       Why would someone who works and has access to the DNC data even need the Russians in the first place?
      </p>
      <p>
       How do the Russians even contact and get involved with a nobody like Seth?
      </p>
      <p>
       Why would an obviously patriotic person (Seth) get involved with helping the Russians in subverting democracy?
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically, please explain or provide some plausible theory that brings Seth, WikiLeaks and the Russians together because I can't understand how or why some young patriotic midwestern Bernie supporter working as a dnc staffer somehow involved in the shadowy world of Russian spycraft.
