      <p>
       There's the saying, "energy goes where attention flows."
      </p>
      <p>
       Energy is the single greatest commodity: if you're of the opinion that TPTB are running a giant energy factory, then our
       <em>
        attention
       </em>
       is what generates it.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you take a more practical approach that TPTB makes us all debt wage slaves, then they do so by keeping our
       <em>
        attention
       </em>
       captive in the pursuit of their self-made money. In this state, we act like zombies with little time left to pursue self-actualization. We remain unaware of our true strength. Our energy is given away for what's karmically pennies on the dollar.
      </p>
      <p>
       Mindfulness is the process of focusing our attention inwards and paying ourselves instead. We receive energy--currency--in the form of wisdom. It gives us the ability to create our own roadmap rather than wandering down a generated path in a sleepless state. It is the path to our sovereignty.
      </p>
      <p>
       Indeed, attention is precious because it's our time. Something we can never get back. Think of the phrase itself, "pay attention." The word
       <em>
        pay
       </em>
       is used precisely because attention itself is of value.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, what have we been paying attention to these days? Personally, my attention has been focused on things that have made me feel a sense of anxiety and hopelessness. Yet these are the emotions prized by those in charge because they can be exploited quite easily. If you're into the esoteric, it's this negative energy that serves as the fuel for the archons, reptilians, whatever.
      </p>
      <p>
       While these negative emotions are an unfortunate byproduct of being informed of the man behind the curtain, they are only useful if they act as a springboard to choosing a more positive path and ultimately, future. This negativity is best used to actualize, "this is
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       how I want the world to be. I want a peaceful, compassionate world."
      </p>
      <p>
       The second part of this statement is one of the most important parts, and unless it's integrated, we all lose. The energy vampires win. If we remain in the negative, we will always be ceding our control by expecting those at the top to change their behavior for the sole reason we are mad at them. Hint: they eat that anger for breakfast and embolden themselves. They only become scared when that anger gets channeled into creation of ideas that cause their demise.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         Get mad about Seth Rich... but use that anger to reform the political system.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Get mad about the usurpation of our privacy... but use that anger to switch to platforms that give a shit about it.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Get mad about GMOs... and use that anger to buy organic or grow your own food.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Get mad about debt slavery... and use that anger to get out of debt and start your own business. And buy local.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       The powers that be only run scared when the second part of action follows.
      </p>
      <p>
       One of my absolute favorite quotes is from Buckminster Fuller:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "You never change things by fighting the existing reality. To change something, build a new model that makes the existing model obsolete."
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The good thing about positive energy is its well-studied ripple effect. There doesn't need to be many of us to make a sizable impact, and the
       <a href="https://www.mum.edu/about-mum/consciousness-based-education-subpages/tm-research/maharishi-effect/">
        Maharishi
       </a>
       effect point to as much. When you activate your light and act with positivity, it's a game changer.
      </p>
      <p>
       We're all just nodes of energy connected to the other. You have the power to grab it from source and use yourself as a conduit to pass it around to others. You are your own printing press. When you tap into source, it can light up the world and elevate humanity outside the reach of those who feed on negative energy. It renders them obsolete on a spiritual and practical level.
      </p>
      <p>
       And never, ever let anyone convince you that being cheerful, happy, or compassionate are synonyms for gullible, ignorant, weak, or stupid. It is no accident that our society has been conditioned to think that snide cynicism is what's needed to feel accepted by our peers.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can imagine countless books that I've had to read about the Art of War, Saul Ailinsky's guides, and 48 Laws of Power. Far fewer books (probably none) were on my curriculum that related to compassion or collective empathy. We are primed to be negative energy machines... and that has to stop.

       Thank you for posting this! I have been using this sort of approach when red-pilling friends and family, as there is definitely a psychosomatic illness effect that often occurs. The truth of our enslavement turns your stomach. So I try to focus them on getting outraged, and galvanize them into taking back control of their dollar and their attention, the two ways that we all fund TPTB.

       Timely indeed. The level of anger and divisiveness in the world has approached the point where it feels orchestrated. It's almost satirical in how blatant it is.

       Could be. But back in the day, Bayer especially pushed opiates, cocaine, and a host of other poisonous products under the pretext of health tonics. Very Irresponsibly.

       So I wouldn't necessarily trust that they are the ones who own Monsanto.

       This is a very smart post and one that we all would be wise to heed.  Ultimately, most of us are here to gather information and discuss issues that we care about changing.  Despair is never a good mindset, so when dealing with depressing topics it's important to have a goal-oriented mindset.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the research studies I've conducted it is clear that humans do not benefit from major "wins" but rather small, consistent forms recognition.  Daily reminders that you're doing something to make a difference are critical.  Stay sane and consistently hold the belief that you can make a difference!

       The Schumann Resonance has been in a state of powerful union for a while now. It's sound signs of collective consciousness being more unified, more powerful than ever before.
      </p>
      <p>
       Personally, I've spent the last year coping with the crumbling away of my dated perception of reality. Alan Watts opened my eyes, my intuition started questioning the nature of things, weed and LSD helped open my mind, and after several months, I concluded that there is no self. Now that the schumann resonance frequency has raised, I can feel these intellectual realizations (about our external world and about our inner world) becoming
       <em>
        experientially
       </em>
       fundamental to my state of being. In other words, we're at a point in 'the game' where things are really starting to pick up. The world is really changing. Our perception of reality is going to change, fundamentally.
      </p>
      <p>
       After the realization that we all believe we are our own thoughts, rather than the consciousness in which the thoughts have arisen since day 1, I looked back into the world to try to understand it. Knowing, factually, that there is no self, I couldn't fathom why we have such a negative, struggling, suffering, hateful, cruel world. But it's because we're
       <em>
        trying too hard
       </em>
       . In truth, love comes when you stop trying to feel it or give it. True love comes when you stop trying, completely.
      </p>
      <p>
       If we all remember the simple things in life, the really, authentically beautiful things, and stop trying to figure out life, it'll come to us. We all, as a species, need to let go of the ego, let go of desire, of attachment, of demand, of judging anything and anyone, of feeling that our lives need to be other-than-what-they-are.
       <em>
        Then
       </em>
       , we will begin to live through the heart, rather than through the mind. We will come together in a more unified, compassionate banding of brothers and sisters than this universe has ever seen humanity do. The world is changing, and we're going to be here to see it and do it.
      </p>
      <p>
       All we have to do is let go of the ego and remember simple beauty. Laugh at the negativity, because now we understand where it's coming from, and the most powerful thing we can do is love the cruel ones back. They cannot defeat love. As corny as it sounds, love trumps all else.

       More people think like you do than you can probably imagine. We've felt isolated for a long time, like we're crazy and don't fit into this world and its demands, but that's only because the world
       <em>
        has

        True love comes when you stop trying, completely. TPTB gave us the psychological paradox through which we've based our lives on in America, known as, "The pursuit of happiness." Yet,
        <strong>
         <em>
          happiness is only truly experienced when the pursuit of it no longer exists.
         </em>

       ~10 years ago, I welcomed a group of college kids into my home to relax and reflect after they had spent the night at a rave under the stars in the Arizona desert.
      </p>
      <p>
       The energy they brought was amazing. One young fellow opined:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        <em>
         "You know, you can never
        </em>
        <strong>
         <em>
          become
         </em>
        </strong>
        <em>
         happy... you can only
        </em>
        <strong>
         <em>
          be
         </em>
        </strong>
        <em>
         happy. It happens in the moment... Happiness is a state of mind - it's a conscious choice"
        </em>
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       That gem of wisdom has reverberated many times through the years.
      </p>
      <p>
       Can we "choose" to be happy? Well, we can certainly choose to be
       <strong>
        <em>
         unhappy
        </em>
       </strong>
       , can't we?

       Beautiful and wise words for sure.  words abd thoughts that for the most part come with age.  the afterthoughts of the battles hard fought abd seldom won. And so remains the question of how to imbue the virtuous life and selfless teachings upon the parents of our future.  It is they who shoulder this change of Id and Ego.  For without their participation, our real future is headed down a path straight yet not true.  so straight that far into the distance can be seen what may come to pass; like the image of a mirage, it is left more to our imagination only from what we have seen in the past. 
Si then,  how do we change our paths?  it is easy to say stay happy and positive yet to the minds of the young,  surrounded by the machinations created to counter that very notion,  it is a struggle indeed. The thought of just letting go is fine if one is alone and certain of resolve. It is much more difficult when protecting and leading a family. 
I myself have cut away the television and have done my best to teach my son the pitfalls of advertising that absolutely surround us every minute of every day.  It is the strain of constant want that is like an ocean that drowns whoever stays in its water too long. 
I have also tried my best to keep teaching all I know to him about anything I know outside of his schooling. The history they fail to teach in school is appalling.  i do my best to show the kindness and giving without expectations so by example and explanation isn't necessary.  i keep the communications honest and open since he was young so they stay open as he gets older.  all this and more even as I struggle to keep sane and stay positive.  I hope he will keep these lessons in his heart. Even so its impossible not to notice the influences of the world around him having their way. 
This is where I say the fight must still come if we want change.  the peaceful and disassociated will otherwise be overrun. The only way the meek will inherit the earth is in its ruin. Let us hope for their sake it is a ruin free from the evils whose chains we leave useless and broken.
      </p>
      <p>
       (no matter if i know better than to rant, i cant help myself once it gets late.  My path to Hell is lined with good intentions.  Good night,  and I do so Love you all)

       Re-channel it in the same way that those who disagree with it re-channel that energy. I have to accept that you believe what you do and likely would disagree with many of my convictions, and likewise I probably feel the same way about you. But that's ok.

       In addition to what you've mentioned about feeding/energizing the unseen vampires, if they appreciated how their thoughts are constantly contributing to what they experience and the effects a direct though has on another person (including those they don't know), some time spent in contemplation about what runs through their mind
       <em>
        unconsciously
       </em>
       and/or habitually, is time well spent.

       Some of the most influential programming we experience doesn't come from the media or the television; it comes from within and warrants inspection so it can be changed if it's determined it isn't in one's best interest.

       Great post. Its so easy to become negative knowing what we know, and seeing so many others around us completely unaware of how they are being manipulated. I'm certainly guilty of getting frustrated and lashing out from time to time (really only when I'm anonymous online, which is still just as bad). I'm going to try harder to remain positive.

       Man, I really wish we understood energy better. We know how to unlock it chemically and transfer it very inefficiently, nowhere near as efficient as our body harnesses it.

       Have you ever stopped to consider that that might be because the natural balance to your (primarily male) energy is largely missing from conspiracy forums?

       I must say this topic has been on my mind for weeks. Several events have occurred in my life and even specific reddit posts have led to understand what it means to have power, and how ultimately what humans seek is it. We may often see power as a selfish thing, because that's the kind that seems to rule the world, but power can be gained and had without taking away the power from others and that's what humanity needs to get in touch with. Power is, in a sense, a lack of victimization. Whenever we feel like victims to our circumstance, it means we feel powerless/helpless. Just like fear, they feed off it, it keeps them on their thrones and does nothing but solidify their places. But having personal power and taking charge of your own life, your own choices, and being aware of the desires we may think make us free, but in reality make us slaves, is the first step to understanding true freedom. True power and freedom is always here and now. You don't need things or status to know what it feels like to be in control of your own life.

       I highly recommend the book "the girl who drank the moon" it's children's fiction, but it's marvelous and the villian is a sorrow eater. 
The sorrow eater creates sorrowful conditions to survive. It's similar to our real life world in that way. 
Totally agree that how we spend our energy is crucial. Energy doesn't die, it is just transferred. What we put out there matters.
