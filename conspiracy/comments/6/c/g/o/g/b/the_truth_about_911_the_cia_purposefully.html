        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>A year-and-a-half ago, I saw this short, 12-minute, incredible YouTube video called &quot;911 Coverup: Bombshell Interview of Richard Clarke...&quot; that will scare the socks off you.</p>

<p>Richard Clarke, whom you see on CNN, NBC News, and on TV all the time, is a serious person. Clarke was Chief Counter-Terror Advisor for the White House from 1998 to 2002 (so Clarke served under both Bill Clinton and George W. Bush, before Clarke resigned early on from the Bush administrtion after Clarke refused to follow Bush&#39;s request to blame the 9/11 Twin Towers attack on Iraq. Clarke, himself, says that&#39;s why he resigned--I guess he wouldn&#39;t be Bush&#39;s liar like Colin Powell, but even General Powell as Secretary of State had enough lying I guess and resigned eventually a few years later. (Remember Powell trotted out the phony &quot;weapons of mass destruction&quot; evidence at the United Nations in the prelude to war.)</p>

<p>In the 12-minute interview, Clarke said that at least 50 people in the C.I.A., including Director George Tenet, Cofer Black, and CIA Station Chief Richard Blee, knew that two of the eventual 9/11 hijackers were already in the country 16 months before 9/11 happened, BUT THESE TOP ECHELON CIA LEADERS DID NOT INFORM THE F.B.I., THE WHITE HOUSE, or RICHARD CLARKE. In fact, Clarke&#39;s daily list of CIA reports that he would read at the Bush White House every morning explicitly had that CIA report deleted from his list, and only top CIA officials can make those deletions from particular individuals&#39; lists. [It may have been CIA Director George Tenet that made the deletion from Clarke&#39;s list.]</p>

<p>Clarke says the F.B.I. was not informed because the C.I.A. knew that the FBI would immediately arrest those two bad guys. Clarke doesn&#39;t know why CIA didn&#39;t want the bad guys arrested, but Clarke charitably suggests that maybe CIA wanted to turn them into double agents working for the CIA instead of Al Qaeda. Or is it possible some people in the murky corners of our government wanted a terrorist attack to happen so we would invade oil-rich Iraq?</p>

<p>The two bad guys, who were known to be involved in previous terrorist activities inside the country of Malaysia, met with a Saudi Intelligence officer while in California from whom they received money, a place to stay in Los Angeles, and other support. Saudi Intelligence is known to closely coordinate with the CIA. These two bad guys eventually made their way to Boston and hijacked one of the planes.</p>

<p>This 12-minute interview with Bill Clinton&#39;s Chief Counter-Terror Advisor Richard Clarke is eye-opening, and a must-see for anyone who wants to better understand the tragedy of 9/11.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My thinking is that they knew about them but did not consider them a real threat. Or did not consider them to be immediately dangerous. What gets me is that the terrorists may have had other people looking very nefarious and scary on purpose to divert attention away from the real hijackers. Just like one of the hijackers at the airport got on the plane by having a partner acting obviously suspicious just to get the security guards attention, so he could just walk on through. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>CIA : Legacy of Ashes is a really good read.  I highly recommend it.  It gives a thorough history of the agency and really puts things into perspective.  A lot of the players during Bushes time were involved with previous administrations so you can read about the international situations that shaped their world view. The CIA is capable of many a bad thing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Once you realize the footage of flight 175 hitting the south tower is aerodynamically and physically impossible, no plane hit the Pentagon or crashed in Shanksville, half a dozen of the so-called terrorists were alive and well the next day, and so on, it becomes obvious that 9/11 was just a sensationalized made-for-tv demolition.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Without boring you with how I arrived to think this, I think probably a missile was used on the Pentagon and <em>maybe</em> on the towers, but not planes. However if I were going to try to pull off something like they did, I would be sure that there was plenty of stuff to see in the sky so there would be many conflicting eyewitness accounts. In other words I would use some planes for distractions, which it seems like they evidently did. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So, genuinely curious, how do we explain the footage from all the different angles of the planes hitting the towers if it was a missile? </p>

<p>I think I&#39;ve always been on board with a missile hitting the pentagon theory, because there&#39;s no food footage and the only footage in existence was taken immediately by some government agency, I forgot who. And the one snippet they did show didn&#39;t look shit all like a plane to me</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes the Pentagon is obvious, there&#39;s no sign of any plane and anyway if there were there would be a dozen or so camera angles of it. So once you establish that, you&#39;re more open to the possibility that if they faked one or two crash sites (Shanksville is another obvious case of there being simply no plane) then they might as well have faked them all. </p>

<p>In short, there&#39;s just not that much footage of the strikes. Only one of flight 11 hitting the north tower, the odds of which being captured are infinitesimal and the videographers (the Naudet brothers) are suspicious indeed. </p>

<p>There are several angles of flight 175 striking the south tower but they are not even consistent with one another, some show anomalies such as a lack of surface detail on the tower, flickering plane parts, etc., and all depict a physically impossible feat -- that is, at the most basic level a passenger jet wouldn&#39;t behave that way when striking a steel and concrete skyscraper, especially towers designed to withstand precisely that. </p>

<p>I would recommend watching at least the first half hour of September Clues. I wouldn&#39;t endorse 100% of their conclusions but they show how the footage is screwy and obviously fabricated.</p>

<p>Watch this. If you really are genuinely curious, then prepare to have your mind blown. I&#39;m serious. If you are interested in 9/11 at all, if you know that something isn&#39;t right, then prepare yourself for this video. The person you are talking with is correct. There were no hijacker. There were no planes.</p>

<p>There were only so many shots on the day of, and they were crude. In the following weeks and months, new &quot;found footage&quot; came out, showing the crashes. This was CGI. It looked fine then, when you look back at the footage now in 2017 it looks silly. The planes slide into a steel framed building like a hot knife through butter. </p>

<p>It was already clear to everyone that there was no plane at the Shanksville crash site. I was a kid and I saw that footage on the very day, and I remember asking... &quot;Where&#39;s the plane?&quot;. It was just a smallish hole in the ground. And it was clear to me even back then that there was no plane in the pentagon wreckage. You can google images of plane crashes. There&#39;s an airplane left in those, however busted it is. The Pentagon crash was a big hole with smaller holes piercing the next few concentric rings. There&#39;s even a few frames of video that were released, it&#39;s certainly not an airliner, it&#39;s a missile strike. </p>

<p>We all believed the planes were real at the WTCs because we saw it on TV. Well, this was their first major experiment, could they manipulate the barrier between TV and reality, could they engineer an entire mass event through TV and through media, and make it &quot;real&quot; in people&#39;s minds? The answer is yes. I implore you, watch this link, &quot;September Clues&quot;, and prepare for an overdose of red pills.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The hijacker fable is complete and utter bullshit, there were no hijackers, they were not needed, WTC 1 and 2 were designed to withstand those aircraft hitting them no problem and no airliner hit WTC7 with invalidates that theory anyway.</p>

<p>We know that the US government had in the past drawn up plans ti use commercial drone aircraft to cause terror, aka Operation Northwoods.</p>

<p>We also know that all three skyscrapers were controlled demolition, so we also know that the 9/11 operation was planned months if not years before hand, probably when PNAC was written up actually.</p>

<p>Literally the only people who could have pulled off 9/11 are high level people in positions of power in the US government, military and the security services </p>

<p>This is besides the fact that Israelis in vans were caught on 9/11 and in one instance, 3 out of 5 were later proven to be Mossad agents.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Besides the deep state crap I think there are some wiffle balls that figure it&#39;s best not to blow a cover or operation at all costs. The intention might be good but if you have an undercover operation that&#39;s producing valid intelligence including a legitimate hijack attack on NYC plot in progress you pull the plug. Fake a death, recall   US spy back to the US what ever. </p>

<p>But not acting on undercover provided intelligence makes undercover provided intelligence all but meaningless if it&#39;s not going to be acted on. Crashing 4 jetliners into US targets is worthing halting an operation and giving the intelligence to the appropriate people for action. That has priority, not preserving &quot;an&quot; existing operation. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just want to add this in case someone knows more or can lead me to more information. Met a gentleman an army pilot who worked in special operations. All this verified to me by proof that in my knowledge of military documents I believe he was SF and he did for planes. The part he had no direct proof over but asked me to take him at his word was when he said what if I told you those guys were not on those planes? I asked how he knew and his response was I flew them into Iraqi days before 9/11. Again no proof of this claim but knowing this gentleman he is not a liar and a lot of his other claims checked out. Again and further information that any one knows, I would love to hear. Question everything.</p>

<p>Theories as to why the CIA did not inform the FBI about the two al-Qaeda operatives go from they didn&#39;t want the FBI to take charge in any investigation. The other is that the CIA had hopes of turning the two into double-agents, or believing that Saudi Arabia was on that path (the two future hijackers had been communicating with and receiving some type of support from a Saudi in San Diego). </p>

<p>Had the FBI known of the two men, they would have definitely been able to at least take them out of the equation (they had the legal ability to bug phones for example).</p>
