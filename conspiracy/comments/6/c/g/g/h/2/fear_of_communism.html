       It's become apparent to me that people conflate communism with authoritarianism. Communism has never been enacted by the people. The people (you and me who aren't rich) should control the means of production and share in that wealth. Not someone gets super fucking rich and pays us shit. This is an incredibly simplified version of what communism is, but wouldn't you rather work and get your fair share of the pie instead of having a boss who can (and will) fire you the second you stop being profitable to his business? I guess I'm just confused as to why communism is always conflated with authoritarianism when the two are not even compatible. Yes the USSR was a shit hole, but for fucks sake, it was because the elite took control of the country. It's pretty obvious why we are brainwashed into believing that communism is always bad. It's because the rich can't get any richer if we were truly to form a party of the people for the people.

       I always try to explain communism in a way that isn't really even communism.  I try to indoctrinate my coworkers, my friends, my wife, random police officers who are beating me and searching my car, librarians, old men and women on a train, people at bus stops. I tell them that if you work 40 hours a week, you deserve the basic necessities of life.. a home, food, water, education for yourself and your children, healthcare, a basic vehicle for transportation..  I say that no one should be allowed to attain wealth so massive that one cannot spend it in a lifetime, ESPECIALLY while families.. WORKING FAMILIES AT THAT.. starve, become sick, experience all types of depravity induced by poverty.. addiction, sick twisted sexual issues..etc.     I tell them that the world is sick.. i ask them to imagine a couple of men and women sitting in an apartment, writing on a sheet of paper the foundations of a better world, a reasonable, realistic plan for a perfect situation of living.  How much wealth is enough? What negative things happen when wealth is capped?  How do we deal with counter revolutionaries? How do we limit useless items, and instead focus on a colorful array of necessities?  How, like the windmill in George Orwells ANIMAL FARM, can we poor our collective intelligence to advance AND DIRECT technology to work for all? In order to build limitless homes, grow limitless food, increase efficiency in the rapid development of a singularity of peace and happiness and meaning?   How do we remove competition, but increase motivation to innovate at the same time? How do you get the maximum of the population to care about one goal, being the realization and manifestation of a singular best possible endgame scenario for humanity?  How do we get to a point where the planets inhabitants are actively choosing a path forward? Where do we want to be in 50 years? 500? 50,000 years?  These are some of the least impossible things I can imagine..  I wouldn't have any clue how to build a computer chip, a television, or a cell phone network from scratch.. but I CAN imagine a better world.   Violence should be universally seen as a negative.. so what's a positive? In a society, there are rules, in the universe there are rules.. such as.. people need food water and shelter,  AND there is an expectation that you should earn your food water and shelter.  That's great,  but the food water and shelter are already yours.  The iron ore is yours.  Same with the natural gas and the gold and the steel and the oil.. it's natural resources that we allowed to be OWNED by single interests, to the detriment of ourselves... it's not FREE SHIT when it's the people's resources to begin with.. fuck your business contracts and your investment portfolio.. people are literally suffering.. good, working, people...     I TRULY BELIEVE THAT THE IDEAS BEHIND COMMUNISM ARE THE BIGGEST THREAT TO ALL THOSE WHO OPPOSE THE DEVELOPMENT OF A BETTER WORLD. It's why we had to slander it so harshly, with billions of dollars of propaganda, with the continuing violence against it and the anger it brings out of the selfish, and/or uninformed, and/or unimaginative.    I love you for being what I call normal and realistic,  and what others call crazy and ridiculously utopian.   Dream on brother and may your dreams become concrete next time the people have had enough struggling. Peace land and bread for all!

       Well if everyone was making decisions together about how the wealth is spread we would just say "That's not fair" and you do not get more than the rest of us. Lol sounds dumb, but it would honestly probably work.

       There are numerous socialist ideologies which have various solutions for this which require no central state i.e. anarcho-syndicalism (which I think might be most compatible with libertarian an-cap type people) but violence will likely be necessary to seize the means of production because when in history has anyone ever willingly ceded power to the people? Democracy was fought for and won with blood.

       And all of those anarcho socialist ideologies will still need to find a way to make sure everyone is playing along. A group of people would still need to be making sure everyone is adhering to their guidelines. If that's not a state power than I don't know what is.

       In a free market there would be no incentive to act violently unless you or your property is violated on an individual level, unlike using violence to stop people from owning property or voluntarily exchanging goods and services.

       So if your factory owner decides he wants to lock you all in for 12 hour shifts, force you to work in dangerous conditions, etc.? Are you just operating under the Voluntaryist assumption that you can just "go and get a different job"?

       Absolutely. There'd be a huge opportunity for someone to open up an identical factory with less aggregious methods of employment. Or, the original factory owner wouldn't use those methods in the first place because if he was smart, he'd realize that a competing factory that treats it's employees with respect would quickly  put him out of business.

       Can you just admit that you don't know anything about the history of the labor movement, or like... how reality functions, in general? Go open up your own factory to compete with Foxconn, I fucking double dare you. Tell me how it turns out.

       Except for the creation of conditions that make 'free market' were some of the most violent episodes in history.  The pattern has been violently clear people from the land, then use force to maintain the system of property rights, and force people to work in this system.

       There are literally 3 countries in the world which have attempted socialist reform which have not been, ultimately, violently overthrown via CIA interference. I wonder if their comparatively greater authoritarianism was both in reaction to this interference and responsible for "protecting" their regimes? Hmmm...

       You realize that the US has overthrown socialists governments across the globe beginning in the 50's in Iran, right? US meddling has ensured that it would never get off it's feet. It's too easy to give money to the rich who then can hire thugs to do their bidding. In small countries they can easily take control of the military and quench any rebellion.

       Well, it's not one rich guy it's a conglomeration. Have you watched Confessions of an Economic Hitman? Read the book? It might help you understand what kind of fuckery we are dealing with, with the global elite. They want you to think that there is no other way. Not trying to be a dick, but if you had a ton of money you'd want this to keep going too.

       We literally OKed the assassination of right-wing constitutionalist General Rene Schneider because he insisted on remaining apolitical, as the Chilean military had always been, stating that he would defend the constitution to the death. But yeah, socialism "just doesn't work," yup. If you don't see the Chilean coup for what it was- the United States engaging in imperialism abroad to protect capitalist profits- then there's something

       Marinaleda expropriated most of their agricultural land, read the article. "Rich guy sharing his wealth" isn't what socialism is, socialism is the communal ownership of the means of production.

      <p>
       It's an example of it not only in practice, but actually in practice
       <em>
        as Marx envisioned
       </em>
       rather than with a centralized state bureaucracy such as the USSR's, as well as an example of it being wildly successful (in comparison to neighboring regions).

       Do you think the bourgeoisie will allow the working class to elect them out of power? I sure would love for a peaceful exchange of power, but you're kidding yourself if you think tyrants would willingly cede the throne, or that use of violence is somehow an inherent immorality given the obvious necessity for violence in establishing democratic rule in the first place. Would you have fought for the throne in the American Revolution?

       Even if every likeminded person were magically transported to an area where there were actually enough land and resources for this to be feasible to do, there are many Marxist schools of thought which argue that single-state Socialism is impossible. This was one of the main reasons for Trotsky's exile, because he argued against Stalin's single-state socialism.
      </p>
      <p>
       I agree with Trotsky, because there will always be external capitalist forces seeking to take advantage of or privatize the assets of any prospective communist nation. The only way to prevent this would be totally closed borders, which as you can see from history doesn't exactly work out well. If you support free trade, you should understand that economic isolation isn't exactly beneficial to those in isolation.

       Communism is literally, by definition, a stateless, classless, money-less society
       <em>
        theorized
       </em>
       to follow in the footsteps of socialism. You're confusing communism with stare capitalism (meaning "socialism" where all capital is held by the state, essentially making ranking party members the "new capitalists" i.e. USSR/China pre-economic liberalization).
      </p>

       There are a lot of people who advocate socialized ownership of the means of production but
       <em>
        decentralized

       and democratic government i.e. libertarian socialists, anarcho-syndicalists, etc

       <em>
        The Conquest of Bread

       Communism has almost always been implemented by formerly oppressed people through a violent revolution. That's hardly a stable environment for any new government, but communism in particular is vulnerable to strongmen. Is that an inherent flaw in the system, or just a quirk of history?
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think we can write off communism until it gets implemented peacefully and deliberately. Preferably a mostly automated bureaucratic state. Everything else is just aristocracy or lawlessness, so what other goal is there?

       I think people who are afraid for their lives and futures are vulnerable to the appeal of strongmen, and the revolutionary/post-revolution period provide the opportunity for these types to take power.
       <em>
        Especially
       </em>
       when various counter-revolutionary forces seek to terrorize the new state, necessitating the suspension of various rights to protect the nascent socialist state, which in turn facilitates the power grabs by these strong men.
      </p>
      <p>
       IMO the USSR would have turned out quite differently had Stalin not subsumed the power of the Soviets (worker councils) since they were the real democratic force.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also a lot of people see the potential for AI/computing to facilitate the management oh a communist economy, and iirc that's one of the things Allende wanted to do in Chile before we Freedom'd the fuck out of them (installing Pinochet in the process) by it would have been very rudimentary compared to what we could do now.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's hoping we can somehow enact socialism peacefully, but I don't see the bourgeoisie giving it up without a fight, and the petite bourgeoisie will always muddy the waters like this is about them.

       I have to deal with the bourgeoisie five days a week- there's no way they're giving it up without a fight. Greed is a real sickness that makes animals out of us. They don't even know how sick they are, in most cases, only that they need more money to be happy.
      </p>
      <p>
       And yes, I mostly blame Stalin for the bad name of communism today. I think some form of communism is inevitable if society keeps progressing the way it is. But in the short term, it feels like we're losing. I worry that it's all going to snap like a rubber band and we'll be back to square one on this stuff. But who knows? Maybe things will work out for the best. Keep fighting the good fight, it's always better than slavery. :)

       So why should we trust them to privately own and control everything, rather than socialize and allow for democratic input? If people aren't that benevolent, why should we trust capitalists like they're benevolent philosopher kings? Especially when for every Musk who is

       Communism works great in small groups where everyone is there voluntarily. The problem starts when someone wants something that doesn't meet the agreed plan. Like someone has an idea that is different, or perceives that someone is getting something special, or someone is taking charge and becoming controlling. Human ego always gets in the way.  Then you have to have some enforcers to make sure everyone goes with the common plan.  Then factions form within the group. Inserection, conflict, power consolidates, the leaders crackdown on those who don't conform. It's an old story.

       The idea that socialism = you all have to literally be the same is just propaganda. The only "different" idea that would absolutely cause it to fall apart would be if somebody wanted to bring back capitalism i.e. what almost all counter-revolutionary forces in socialist countries sought to achieve. This is fundamentally the same as if people wanted to go back to feudalism from capitalism, or bringing back the monarchy.

       <em>
        Stalinism
       </em>
       forces a great deal of conformity, but there were numerous socialist critics of Stalinism who were still socialist. There's a reason Lenin wanted Stalin out of power before his death, and there's a reason Stalin had everybody aware of this killed or exiled.
      </p>

       For anybody who thinks Stalinism = Communism, try reading

       That's the problem. Under communism, if I want to grow some vegetables and pay someone an agreeable amount that makes both parties happy(captialism), I'd be seen as an enemy of the state.

       This isn't capitalism, this is trade. Capitalism would be you
       <em>
        personally
       </em>
       owning the land used to produce these vegetables, likely paying a wage-laborer to do the labor for you as you pocket the profit, only paying the laborer a small portion of the value his work created.
      </p>
      <p>
       Socialism would involve the communal ownership of this land, with its use to be decided democratically by the community. If there's a plot of land and 99/100 people want to use it for something else, but you want to grow crops, then there would be a problem... but it's not like you're any more free to grow crops on someone else's private property as it is.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not all forms of socialism are the same as the Stalinist "go here, do this- or choose between gulag and bullet" stuff people tend to think of.
      </p>
      <p>
       p.s. Two of my favorite Kropotkin quotes from
       <em>
        The Conquest of Bread
       </em>
       deal with this
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "We cry shame on the feudal baron who forbade the peasant to turn a clod of earth unless he surrendered to his lord a fourth of his crop. We called those the barbarous times. But if the forms have changed, the relations have remained the same, and the worker is forced, under the name of free contract, to accept feudal obligations. For, turn where he will, he can find no better conditions. Everything has become private property, and he must accept, or die of hunger."
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       And
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        “In virtue of this monstrous system, the son of the worker, on entering life, finds no field which he may till, no machine which he may tend, no mine in which he may dig, without accepting to leave a great part of what he will produce to a master. He must sell his labour for a scant and uncertain wage. His father and his grandfather have toiled to drain this field, to build this mill, to perfect this machine. They gave to the work the full measure of their strength, and what more could they give?”

       Ok so it's only slightly less oppressive. Gotcha. So I guess I'll update my scenario: what if I wanted to pay the community an agreeable sum to buy a piece of land myself, so that I can farm it, because I believe my needs aren't sufficiently provided for? I'd be an enemy of the state for wanting to better improve my life through non violent, totally voluntary exchange.

       That's literally what I'm talking about. You're describing purchasing capital i.e. the land in question (which shouldn't even be "for sale" since the whole point of socialism is the social ownership of the means of production) and allowing you to own and accumulate capital both defeats the purpose of socialism and plants the seed for a counter-revolution. You buy one plot of land, and then another, and then another, and then another, and when you're the largest land-owner in your community... do you not think you would hold any more power than others in your community, who own no land?
      </p>
      <p>
       If you want to farm for yourself, that's between you and your community. If you want to
       <em>
        own the land
       </em>
       then you are jeopardizing the entire system.
      </p>
      <p>
       p.s. Marxist thought distinguishes between private and personal property, so there is a distinction to be made. Are you buying more land than you can use, to potentially hire laborers to work on your behalf? That's private property. Are you
       <em>
        temporarily owning
       </em>
       land for
       <em>
        your own personal use
       </em>
       ? That's personal property.
      </p>
      <p>
       Owning a house to rent to others = private property
      </p>
      <p>
       Owning a house because it's been in your family for generations and you're actively using it as your home = personal property

       But it doesn't have to be that way.  Not if you are the state. Side deals in small quantities should be totally fine.  Everyone works towards a goal, and gets basic necessities for their work. Extra luxuries are attained through your model of small scale free market micro capitalism. This side capitalism must be capped though so no one can become a king.   Everyone should be as rich a single possible

       As long as there is one government granting one monopoly or instituting one regulation, opportunity for actual free trade is cut off, allowing unethical and inefficient companies to stay more profitable than they should. So my amswer to your question is yes, directly or indirectly.

       Maybe my wording is bad. Not "be the same", but go along with the program. From each according to his ability, to each according to his need. So, if your perceived need or ability differs from the "states " perception of your need or ability, then conflict exists and punishment ensues. This is the reality, not the theory espoused by groups that support the concept.

       Maybe in the USSR/China, where material circumstances led to the sort of central state authoritarianism you're describing, but like I said, that isn't necessarily what socialism must be. Everything could be managed and owned democratically, which isn't perfect (since people aren't perfect) but it's not like you can go against the wishes of your community (breaking laws) as it is under capitalism.  The bourgeois state makes the rules, and if you don't like it you can deal with the cops.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are current examples of socialism functioning very well, i.e.
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marinaleda">
        Marinaleda, Spain
       </a>
       , so it's not like it's impossible. I know that there are many more examples of its
       <em>
        failure
       </em>
       , but I would like to point out that almost universally the CIA has had a great deal of involvement with these failures (i.e. Guatemala in 1953, Iran in 1954, Chile in 1973, Nicaragua with the Sandinistas, etc. I would even argue that the USSR and China might have turned out differently had there been global cooperation rather than an arms race between belligerents).

       I don't care whether there are examples of socialism working, that's fine. I just disagree with it. If I were living there and wanted to open up a different farm with better conditions and payment, or if I thought I should be paid more for doing more work, etc. I would an enemy. I don't like that.

       I think you might want to actually read Marxist literature for yourself, because I think you misunderstand some of the fundamental concepts here and I am not certain of my ability to explain them properly.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>

       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       If you wanted to "open up a farm," you could do so- you would just need democratic support from your community. And why shouldn't you? It's not your land, it is everyone's land.
      </p>
      <p>
       Please re-read and think about those Kropotkin quotes in my other posts, and envision a world where
       <em>
        everything
       </em>
       is private property (it shouldn't be hard- it's our world). You're no more free to do as you please under capitalism, because you would still need to labor for another (giving up the majority of the value of your work!) for a wage to save to accrue capital to buy your land. Is this not fundamentally identical to indentured servitude? You, with no capital, must labor for those who possess it in order to
       <em>
        maybe
       </em>
       buy your freedom.
      </p>
      <blockquote>

        or if I thought I should be paid more for doing more work, etc.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The whole idea is that under capitalism
       <strong>
        <em>
         you are not paid what your labor is worth
        </em>
       </strong>
       . If you were, then your employer would receive no profit, defeating the whole point of the system. If your labor creates, in a day, $200 of value, and you're paid only 80 (and must pay taxes on that 80!) then you are obviously not receiving your due compensation.

       This is the old - but it wasn't real communism argument. Even if what you are dreaming about was implemented human nature would soon kick in. Why should person A who is working very hard get the same as person B who is sitting on his butt? The people in charge would very quickly become corrupt because they would have the means to get more than everyone else and then in order to keep their extra wealth they're going to need to stomp on rest. This is why it has never worked and will never work. People are not altruistic.

       What's insane, is the new breed of pseudo right wing rural conspiracy theorists, who conflate communism with "Obama" and "liberals" and have no grasp of what it means, and how amazing of a system it would be ESPECIALLY FOR THEM. It's literally made for them and they are so wildly uninformed that they advocate against it violently. Communism must be the most widely used term, in the wrong way.

       the concept of communism is broken from the start. the workers should NOT directly control the means of production. some people are more able than others. some people want more than others and are willing to do more to get it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here is an example that i just made up...
      </p>
      <p>
       Say Jimmy invents a machine to stamp license plates better and more effeciently than any other that exists with the simple push of a button, it takes 10 years of his life and a million dollars to build the prototype and start producing them.
      </p>
      <p>
       A different guy, Billy has a unique business plan and the skills required to implement it, and decided to go into the licence plate stamping business. He takes out a 5 million dollar loan to get the business going, buys 3 of Jimmy's machines (at say $500k each) and a building to run the business from.
      </p>
      <p>
       he hires workers to push the buttons on the super easy to use machines, his business plan works out great and he is the most successful licence plate stamper in the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       explain to me what the workers did to earn as much (or more cumulatively) than Jimmy or Billy. They both invested huge chunks of money, and chunks of their lives to make the thing happen. the workers pushed buttons.
      </p>
      <p>
       p.s.
there is no such thing as a "fair share" because someone will always have to dictate what is fair to those who believe that they earned more. Every system needs a force to dictate who gets what. It is better to have a central authority do it, or the power of the market (i.e all of the workers collectively spending their money)?

       Fitting. They are not mutually exclusive and a true ideal communist state would
       <em>
        have

       to be completely democratic. On the other side of the coin a complete capitalistic state would not be democratic. Oligarchies never end well.

       Here we go again with the "it just ain't been done by the right people" BS again. Look, any time you hand over that much power to a central government the central government will be infiltrated by "the wrong people" again. The real goal is provide the individual with as much Liberty and autonomy as possible and create a government devoted to those ends. Communism and socialism are both completely at odds with the individual and therefore are inherently suspect.

       All the -isms have been distorted over time to serve power and support particular historical narratives.  For example, fascism used to be 'corporate government' and now it's 'an authoritarian and nationalistic right-wing system of government'

       There isn't. Communism has never been enacted the way it was originally envisioned.

       I think people who are afraid for their lives and futures are vulnerable to the appeal of strongmen, and the revolutionary/post-revolution period provide the opportunity for these types to take power.
       <em>
        Especially
       </em>
       when various counter-revolutionary forces seek to terrorize the new state, necessitating the suspension of various rights to protect the nascent socialist state, which in turn facilitates the power grabs by these strong men.

       IMO the USSR would have turned out quite differently had Stalin not subsumed the power of the Soviets (worker councils) since they were the real democratic force.
      </p>

       Also a lot of people see the potential for AI/computing to facilitate the management oh a communist economy, and iirc that's one of the things Allende wanted to do in Chile before we Freedom'd the fuck out of them (installing Pinochet in the process) by it would have been very rudimentary compared to what we could do now.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's hoping we can somehow enact socialism peacefully, but I don't see the bourgeoisie giving it up without a fight, and the petite bourgeoisie will always muddy the waters like this is about them.
