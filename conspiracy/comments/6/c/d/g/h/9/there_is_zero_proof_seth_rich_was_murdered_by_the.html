    <div class="md"><p>Because this is a fucking conspiracy sub, what do you expect? </p>

<p>Seth Rich is about as juicy as conspiracies get currently. There is more evidence to suggest it was a planned assassination than to suggest is was a botched robbery.</p>

<p>Also Podesta emails making &quot;an example of a leaker&quot; is very suspect.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Well if you knew all the Podesta emails except the ones that gave you a pedophile boner... I&#39;m under the impression Tulsi Gabbard was the DNC leak or helped it in some way and then they told her she won&#39;t be getting PAC money for supporting Bernie and dropping out as DNC vice chair.</p>

<p>Which is why she is currently saying she won&#39;t be taking money, because she can&#39;t get it anyway.</p>

<p>Also... it&#39;s only juicy if you&#39;re a bernie bro or trump supporter (For some odd reason).</p>

<p>So seriously, &quot;there&#39;s more evidence it was a planned assassination&quot; is evidence of how delusional you all are. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>First of all I&#39;m neither a Bernie supporter or a Trump supporter, I don&#39;t understand where you get that assumption. Being interested in the death of Rich doesn&#39;t mean you are partisan. Justice isn&#39;t partisan. </p>

<p>Secondly, what evidence and Podesta  emails do you have to suggest Gabbard was the DNC leak? I&#39;m very privy to the Podesta leaks, there is more corruption to them than just a few pizza emails. </p>

<p>Finally, what about the holes in the police report? </p>

<p>What about the police cams, it&#39;s been months.</p>

<p>What about the bar owner who went to the white house before Seth was murdered?</p>

<p>What about the fact he was killed in a precise place in DC, completely avoiding traffic cams?</p>

<p>These are all questions yet to be answered, and until then justice will need to be served through citizen investigations.</p>

<p>You still haven&#39;t even discussed my points of how he even got access. Before we jump to how this assassination was carried out you think you people would have a little fucking critical thinking and first want to know proof if he was even the leaker in the first place.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve tried to say my points in other posts but there&#39;s so many of them. </p>

<p>I know people give the excuse that this is a conspiracy but until we got at least knowledge he was the leaker without KIMDOTCOM, I don&#39;t think it is a conspiracy. I&#39;ll fully entertain this if we knew Seth was the leaker. Because it seems much more likely it was a random act of violence and wikileaks got the emails through paid hackers.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Kim DotCom made a string of claims during the election that never amounted to anything. Ask yourself why he would suddenly claim it&#39;s true and he has proof <em>now,</em> now that the theory has been resurrected by a FULLY DEBUNKED Fox News-related episode. </p>

<p>The idea that Seth was the leak to WL has not been debunked, but the whole Monday drama has been, admittedly, by the same guy making that claim. </p>

<p>Kimdotcom is desperate for relevance, and simply promoting the theory. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is a suspicious core to his death that affords pretty unstandable skepticism. However, the promotion of only one acceptable, very simplified theory leads me to believe the real effort here is to just spread the theory around, get as many people to believe it as possible, create reasonable doubt re: the Russian hack concept-- thus, it feels all the world like coordinated, seeded propaganda, like Pizzagate, Spirit Cooking, and in a way like Trump/Russia (although many, many people with their credibility on the line are involved in very real investigations there, which doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s true, but is being taken vastly more seriously as a possibility).</p>

<p>Fully with you that proving Seth was the DNC leaker would open the door in a major way. So far, just claims. </p>

<p>And as I&#39;ve said before: this has never felt like an effort to find out who killed Seth, more an effort to prove the DNC did it and exonerate all accusations against Putin&#39;s regime. Nobody&#39;s researching gang activity in DC, linking to the crime waves in and around his neighborhood, or considering any other tract besides the extremely political &quot;Clinton Kill List&quot; one. </p>
