       Because this is a fucking conspiracy sub, what do you expect?

      <p>
       Seth Rich is about as juicy as conspiracies get currently. There is more evidence to suggest it was a planned assassination than to suggest is was a botched robbery.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also Podesta emails making "an example of a leaker" is very suspect.

      <p>
       Well if you knew all the Podesta emails except the ones that gave you a pedophile boner... I'm under the impression Tulsi Gabbard was the DNC leak or helped it in some way and then they told her she won't be getting PAC money for supporting Bernie and dropping out as DNC vice chair.
      </p>
      <p>
       Which is why she is currently saying she won't be taking money, because she can't get it anyway.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also... it's only juicy if you're a bernie bro or trump supporter (For some odd reason).
      </p>
      <p>
       So seriously, "there's more evidence it was a planned assassination" is evidence of how delusional you all are.

       First of all I'm neither a Bernie supporter or a Trump supporter, I don't understand where you get that assumption. Being interested in the death of Rich doesn't mean you are partisan. Justice isn't partisan.
      </p>
      <p>
       Secondly, what evidence and Podesta  emails do you have to suggest Gabbard was the DNC leak? I'm very privy to the Podesta leaks, there is more corruption to them than just a few pizza emails.
      </p>
      <p>
       Finally, what about the holes in the police report?
      </p>
      <p>
       What about the police cams, it's been months.
      </p>
      <p>
       What about the bar owner who went to the white house before Seth was murdered?
      </p>
      <p>
       What about the fact he was killed in a precise place in DC, completely avoiding traffic cams?
      </p>
      <p>
       These are all questions yet to be answered, and until then justice will need to be served through citizen investigations.

       You still haven't even discussed my points of how he even got access. Before we jump to how this assassination was carried out you think you people would have a little fucking critical thinking and first want to know proof if he was even the leaker in the first place.

       Rich worked directly for the DNC. He also worked as a Expansion Data Director, so he obviously knew his was around a computer, and collectiong information. It's not unreasonable to believe he also undersood how to use certain scripts or hacking tools to access emails behind a protected server.

       We people as you like to call us. Are not here to prove he was definitely the leaker. We could prove he wasn't the leaker and it was someone else that's the whole point of this sub to prove or debunk a theory. That's what a conspiracy is, were not here to divulge in real aliens or who shot JFK we are here to focus on the evidence and uncover the truth of it whether its true or false.

       Russia this and Russia that, roll out of the the wrong side of bed blame Russia. Where are your from if you don't mind me asking. Because i find the Russian nation quite easy going. Didn't a man in a article  on Russia start all this shit and its carried on since? The guy actually admitted he lied and made it up. You're falling for a msm narrative pal and I feel sorry for you.

       Get used to it, this isn't going away until we solve his murder, and anyone trying to obstruct that may face consequences.

       You, for example, have devoted your entire existence on reddit to trying to talk down this story down despite the fact that it's an unsolved murder. Every moral, sane human being should want to see justice served to his killers, so what's your M.O.?

       I know people give the excuse that this is a conspiracy but until we got at least knowledge he was the leaker without KIMDOTCOM, I don't think it is a conspiracy. I'll fully entertain this if we knew Seth was the leaker. Because it seems much more likely it was a random act of violence and wikileaks got the emails through paid hackers.

       Kim DotCom made a string of claims during the election that never amounted to anything. Ask yourself why he would suddenly claim it's true and he has proof
       <em>
        now,
       </em>
       now that the theory has been resurrected by a FULLY DEBUNKED Fox News-related episode.
      </p>
      <p>
       The idea that Seth was the leak to WL has not been debunked, but the whole Monday drama has been, admittedly, by the same guy making that claim.
      </p>

       Kimdotcom is desperate for relevance, and simply promoting the theory.

       That's because they are using the Seth Rich story the same way they used Pizzagate. This is a honey pot created to discredit this community. "Look at these evil conspiracy theorists invoking the name of this slain individual to support their agenda! We need to do something to stop this sort of thing!" And people take the bait every time this happens.

       I think they had to because there is a full blown leftist conspiracy theory that got a special counsel and everything. I wish I knew a place I could read more about it. It's almost like information is being suppressed. Anyway.

       It is kind of evil to make assumptions about things you don't know based on the SPECULATIONS of strangers.

       There is a suspicious core to his death that affords pretty unstandable skepticism. However, the promotion of only one acceptable, very simplified theory leads me to believe the real effort here is to just spread the theory around, get as many people to believe it as possible, create reasonable doubt re: the Russian hack concept-- thus, it feels all the world like coordinated, seeded propaganda, like Pizzagate, Spirit Cooking, and in a way like Trump/Russia (although many, many people with their credibility on the line are involved in very real investigations there, which doesn't mean it's true, but is being taken vastly more seriously as a possibility).

       Fully with you that proving Seth was the DNC leaker would open the door in a major way. So far, just claims.
      </p>
      <p>
       And as I've said before: this has never felt like an effort to find out who killed Seth, more an effort to prove the DNC did it and exonerate all accusations against Putin's regime. Nobody's researching gang activity in DC, linking to the crime waves in and around his neighborhood, or considering any other tract besides the extremely political "Clinton Kill List" one.
