       Seth Rich was discovered by DNC after the Bernie/DNC voter data compromise controversy &amp; it was his boss Amy Dacey (ties to SEIU) that uncovered it &amp; was the co-worker he had "issues with" Last post was buried. Know its a lot of text, but there's a lot to link together here to paint the full picture. After seeing a thread (
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/6bong6/working_theory_according_to_rod_wheeler_pi/">
        https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/6bong6/working_theory_according_to_rod_wheeler_pi/
       </a>
       ) that Amy Dacey might be a key person at DNC connected to Seth since she was his boss while he was working on the Voter App project, I searched back through the wiki podesta files to see if she came up and YES SHE DID. Im going to start here and connect it all back to Seth and how she might be a key player in all this.
      </p>
      <p>
       Rewind back to 2007, Amy worked for SEIU and has a LONG history of working with Podesta. Here's an email about a meeting she set up with lots of names we will recognize (hint: Ballsack Eyes!)
       <a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/40160">
        https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/40160
       </a>
       (note: This email has Amy Dacey setting up a meeting between Soros and Co. Herb and Marion Sandler are listed in that meeting. Herb Sandler is the person who wrote the email to Podesta asking if he'd do better playing dominoes on cheese or on pasta.)
      </p>
      <p>
       She moved to the Government Relations Dept with SEIU:
       <a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/26012">
        https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/26012
       </a>
       And she also was Executive Director at Fund for America working with the same crowd:
       <a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/24363">
        https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/24363
       </a>
       She then went on to be CEO of the DNC and was leading the investigation into the voter database compromise that happened in December 15. Tl;dr for those that dont remember: the dnc voter database was compromised and Bernie campaign ended up w voter info from Hillarys campaign. They had NGA VAN do a few audits to find what was compromised and reported the results and who was responsible in the Bernie campaign for accessing info they weren't supposed to. The director of voter data for the Bernie campaign was fired as a result. This is the report she sent out after the initial audit:
       <a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/15792">
        https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/15792
       </a>
       At the end of this report, she refers to continuing the audit which is when I think they might have initially discovered Seth as a leaker. The DNC has also instructed NGP VAN to conduct a review process of their internal procedures to identify how this mistake was allowed to happen and prevent further such mistakes. The DNC is currently beginning the process of securing an additional, independent audit by a data security firm of NGP VAN’s procedures.
      </p>
      <p>
       As a result of this analysis, NGP VAN found that campaign staff on the Sanders campaign, including the campaign’s national data director, had accessed proprietary information about which voters were being targeted by the Clinton campaign — and in doing so violated their agreements with the DNC. After discovering, he accessed things he shouldn't have and suspected him, then that could have lead to the unmasking hunch everyone has for further surveillance. If that is the case then perhaps this NGP VAN is also a point of research as they would have played a part in uncovering this? Other important note: he was working on the voter app project for dnc when he discovered the fraudulent voting sites issue, which was reportedly one of his motivations to work with Wikileaks. If you read the emails exchanges during the Bernie/DNC Voter Compromise, the Hillary campaign wanted to know the "ACTUAL DAMAGE" of the compromise perhaps afraid the fraud would be discovered?
       <a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/35361">
        https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/35361
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       According to a few news articles Seth made the exchange to this ex MI6 agent that now works with Wikileaks in September.
       <a href="http://m.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/dec/14/craig-murray-says-source-of-hillary-clinton-campai/">
        http://m.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/dec/14/craig-murray-says-source-of-hillary-clinton-campai/
       </a>
       Important because if we was exchanging info back in September and continuing through this ongoing audit/investigation which started in December then it could've been discovered during that.

       Tell me how "the stupid things the president has done today" are more relevant to conspiracy than an alleged plot to assassinate a DNC employee for leaking the most influential set of documents in years?
      </p>
      <p>
       There's currently about ten different subs dedicated solely on "thestupidthingsthepresidenthasdonetoday" and only one talking about Seth Rich.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you have an actual Trump conspiracy that isn't being talked about, throw it in, but it's weird to me how people seem to think that the Seth Rich story is a distraction when it's literally a keystone conspiracy right now. Even if it turns out that it was a random robbery after all, it would be crucial information to know for sure.

       You're right. The DNC allegedly murdering some low-level staffer is far more important than the multi-billion dollar arms deal that the President just signed with a country that just happens to be excluded from his travel ban.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not to mention that Trump lost all interest in investigating the DNC shortly after her won. "I don't wanna hurt the Clintons" were his words back in November.

      <p>
       Can't we talk about both? My point was the childish complaints by CaptainBallz and others that the Seth Rich story is a distraction that takes away the focus off of Trump, when that is in no way the case.
      </p>
      <p>
       Both stories and others are important. We can contemplate all of them. There is no need to decide. I just think it's dangerous to want to undermine a topic that is taboo everywhere else but here, which is why I defended the Seth Rich story.

       You asked how "stupidthingtheprsidenthasdonetoday" is more important than Seth Rich, and that's what I'm responding to. A single murder compared to arms deals, NAFTA negotiations, and the rest of the President's priorities. I know you know why one is more important than the other.

      <p>
       We certainly
       <em>
        can
       </em>
       talk about both, but wasn't Trump elected (at least in part) to go after corruption in Washington? Why do we have to keep talking about this in small corners of Reddit without any attention from the man who promised justice?

       The arms deal with Saudi Arabia is one of the things I certainly wouldn't have put in the category of "stupid things the president has done today", and it certainly demands our attention. I apologize if that was ambiguous.
      </p>
      <p>
       CaptainBallz indicated that the Seth Rich murder is not relevant to
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       , which was my main disagreement. I think it's extremely relevant. By "stupid things the president has done today", I took it to mean the kinds of things he does on a daily basis that are just moronic but by and large unimportant, the kinds of things that multiple subreddits are already dedicated to.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are certainly topics of great importance relating to Trump and his admin going on that are barely even talked about in those anti-Trump subreddits. The Saudi arms deal is one of them. His ties to Israel is another. His trust in Kushner is also suspicious. These and more are fundamental questions of importance surrounding his presidency, but these are not the kinds of things that the media, and as I interpreted his comment, CaptainBallz want us to be talking about. It seems that they would much rather engage in anti-Trump identity politics by focussing on "the stupid things the president did today", rather than discussing the merits and intentions of his actually decisive actions.

       Jeez dude you really took that to heart. And the completely wrong way. I wasn't telling you how to think or anything. 
I was saying that the Seth Rich thing is a distraction from the t_d people that have invaded this sub. They have latched onto it to make noise about as they do, like they did with 🍕 gate. They want to drive the narrative back to where Democrats=bad. 
Yes if Hillary was behind his death then she should pay but one mans death does not compare to all the other shady things going on ATM.

       Given that team hillary is trying to impeach Trump, I would be in that camp as well. He didn't. The swamp still needs draining. But this is the interesting question. Who are the players? Especially the neocon types. Imho, he isn't one, but he's certainly surrounded by them.

       you do realize Obama got that arms deal rolling during his presidency, right?  and Obama had signed a 30-some billion arms deal with Israel recently.
      </p>
      <p>
       Our war mongering in the middle east is a huge fucking problem, no one will deny that.  But don't push any bullshit that Trump is in any way primarily responsible for that involvement.  There is a machine much, much larger than him at play here.  I very much doubt he even has a choice in the matter.

       Why would we focus on international deals that are essentially right out in the open when it's clear there are efforts to thwart investigation into a potential political hit job?  oh, but he's just a "low-level staffer", Wikileaks hints around his death shouldn't raise any eyebrows at all.

       Not a fan of Obama doing it either. Us giving weapons to other countries has not always worked out in our favor, and this is unsettling to say the least. Our MIC is a beast that spans the globe, and deals like this just feed it more.

       You got a special counsel that all Democrats have so much confidence in. What more do you want?? Why don't you leave it to the special counsel to investigate since he can subpoena all the evidence?

      <p>
       Sure wish we could actually get someone to give two shits to actually investigate Seth Rich's death. Because taking a year to only narrowly investigate the botched robbery angle has gotten police nowhere but they refuse to look where all the red flags are pointing. It's pretty obvious like the DC police are obstructing and covering up instead of investigating.

       That's the distinction.  One is on the public record and you'll get nods of sympathy at the thanksgiving dinner table when you bring it up.  The other, friends will stop talking to you because they think you must be crazy for believing it.

       The thing is, every tiny morsel of potential evidence can be  relevant.  Don't come into a thread dedicated to that type of scope and shame people into thinking it's unimportant work.  Now if it's a manufactured goose chase by some disinfo agents, that's another story.  Otherwise, just let people spend their efforts as they please.

       Mock it all you want.  People's hypocritical rhetoric of slamming Trump for shit like Obama wasn't doing the exact same thing makes it a valid point.  I'm not defending the actions in any way.  I'm pointing out that there is a broader picture, and we should be careful not to buy into partisan slander.

       In the video you linked they said nothin about the DNC she even said "the two" meaning she believes the police theory of a botched robbery by two people. Stop this bullshit and let this family grieve in peace. The guy who started this conspiracy theory has even backed off his claims! Cmon?

       So... Seth's ghost handed over the emails to Craig Murray 2 months after he died?? Or Seth traveled to the future, May 25, from September 2015, to get the emails back in time to September 2015 to give them to Craig Murray then?  This is rich.

       When did the DNC leaks occur?  Starting June 15th (Guccifer 2.0) thru July 22nd (Wikileaks) 2016.  So what exactly was Craig Murray receiving in September 2016 and how could it possibly relate to Seth Rich?

       Did you miss where he was talking about two leaks? In the article, he was talking about both leaks: DNC and Podesta.
      </p>
      <p>
       He never said he got both leaks at that Sept meeting. And I assume the Sept meeting was for the Podesta leaks, obviously.

       You're right. The DNC allegedly murdering some low-level staffer is far more important than the multi-billion dollar arms deal that the President just signed with a country that just happens to be excluded from his travel ban.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not to mention that Trump lost all interest in investigating the DNC shortly after her won. "I don't wanna hurt the Clintons" were his words back in November.

       Not a fan of Obama doing it either. Us giving weapons to other countries has not always worked out in our favor, and this is unsettling to say the least. Our MIC is a beast that spans the globe, and deals like this just feed it more.

        Why would we focus on international deals that are essentially right out in the open when it's clear there are efforts to thwart investigation into a potential political hit job?

       One actually happened, and by your own admission one
