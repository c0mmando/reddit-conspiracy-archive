    <div class="md"><p>maybe there are some out there..but they see us as the same way we see the last tribes of brazilia.. they dont allow contact from the outside  because of multiple reasons (moral in the most cases). and that is probably what ever intelligent life in universe sees us. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sometimes I like to think Aliens are our future genetic ancestors. As in... they may be to homo-sapiens what we are to Neanderthal. </p>

<p>When I was a teenager I saw what looked like a double ended ferris wheel in the sky with foggy red lights. Never could explain that, but someone I cautiously explained the experience to told me it was something called Aurora Project. <em>shrug</em></p>

<p>Oh, I saw a morse-code type chemtrail yesterday. Never seen one like that. Kinda kooky. </p>

<p>My sky has been a perpetual grid for so long that I find myself startled when I look up and see big, billowing, natural clouds. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think their are &quot;good&quot; and &quot;bad&quot; aliens. The good ones are spiritually evolved much more than we are. They are in tune with the infinite fractal nature of reality. They are basically like buddhas, they have transcended time/space, they exist in the 4th dimension and beyond. Some people refer to these beings as the Pleiadians or the Nordics. The Sirians and Arcturians are supposedly benevolent ET as well. They can manipulate matter and travel through time. They are not bound by anything. </p>

<p>God is within everything, humans can tap into a realize we are all god / the universe. Separation is an illusion, everything is one. I cannot prove these beings exist but i personally believe in them. I especially started believing in them after some shrooms trip in which i felt my consciousness was scratching the surface of the mental level that these beings exist on. I truly understood that everything is like nikola tesla said, &quot;frequency, energy, and vibration&quot;. At the peak of one of my mushroom trips, i could hear a buzzing sound increasing in frequency, with an immense amount of energy surging through me, i eventually completely let go of everything and i entered the present moment. It seemed as if I had tapped into an bank of knowledge that felt extremely alien but also it also felt extremely ancient. It also became extremely clear to me that we&#39;re the opposite of alone in this universe, and that actually the universe is teeming with life. I think Humanity will eventually evolve and join an intergalactic society of beings from all over the cosmos. These are just my beliefs at the moment, I am not proposing any of this as fact.
This vid explains something I have trouble conveying that supports my beliefs.</p>
