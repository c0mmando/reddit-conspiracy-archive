       If T_D reopens it will continue to be under attack. VOAT is closing even if an angle saves it for a moth the admins let it slip too long. The attack on
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       is only starting and will only get worse with no help from the admins.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe T_D could save voat maybe the timing is just right to save them. But the brigade is looking to follow them on purpose and the witch hunt continues on to voat and

       No it's not proof. They are same old mods. Do you know why they removed it? - because they don't want it to show up on r/all. Then we will have a lot blue pilled refugees. A lot. Shills too.

       Isn't the goal of finding conspiracies to educate other people about them in an effort to solve the problem? If that is the case wouldn't you want people that are less informed to come visit and take a look? Why hide in the shadow? If the theory is correct it should be able to stand up to scrutiny and questions. If it can't stand up to questioning, is it worth believing?

       So you are flat-out saying, with no ambiguity at all, that people who support Trump are welcome here but those who do not would be undesirable, and that you believe the mods are acting in a way to push that agenda and shape the community in that direction.

       r/conspiracy has historically not been left

       right. It's been a place for

       and people who are
       <em>
        neither

       to talk about conspiracies, strange happenings, government corruption by all sides, outside the mainstream theories, and hidden elites. People of all sorts of belief systems have all been together here under those common interests for a number of years.

      <p>
       That you are openly pushing the idea of making it for people with only a specific mindset ... should it really surprise you if someone calls you a fascist?

       If you talk about Trump's connections to Jeffrey Epstein, and put it in the context of his teen pageants and such, do you think that would be an open-minded discussion?

       Trump started to hate episten after meeting. Also he has tweeted that pedos should get dead penalty and many more things. Yes td would listen, but they are back in their no-free-speech meme heaven now. And with we i'm reffering to

       You're correct. I think we need to stop scattering and stay put and fight this even if its bad odds. At least know in the end we did not just sit there while the end of free speech happened right in front of us.

       While I generally agree with you, don't forget that T_D was absolutely abhorrent about actually implementing the free speech it claimed to love. Anything even slightly negative about Trump was removed and the poster banned, even if they'd been a contributor and Trump supporter for months. I hope whatever the next big Trump sub is, it's more free and less fanatical.

       I can testify to this. I'm a Trump supporter (although I don't agree with everything he's done) and I got banned from

       I've been on that sub since way back in 2016, I think it's more of a training wheels deal when people curious about Trump or who even dislike Trump go to find out about Trump. Its purpose I wouldn't say is to discuss core stances or positions, but they do give nods to commentators who are willing to do a deep dive, people like Ben Shapiro are harsh on Trump but you wouldn't get called a shill for appreciating Shapiro.                                                                 When it comes to t-d being a 'free space' with 'free ideas', well the first thing I imagine if 'dissenting' views are allowed grow on the sub is that it will be bombarded by all sides of Reddit. People from tech subs will have their own issues with Trump , people amped up from r/politics and other anti-trump subs will do whatever on t-d, the result will be posts with 1k upvotes and 1k comments constantly.                                                             I personally don't mind people's views on any matter and don't get offended unless it's something extremely personal. If other subs want to impose their own rules on their sub and curate a certain space for a certain type of internet user, then I have no issue with that which is what I think t-d is doing. I believe mods have the right to treat users to their sub in whichever way they choose, but Reddit admins should be treating all subs fairly and equally. Which clearly they haven't done for quite a while now. People are arguing in favor of admins putting pressure on this one sub on the basis that it isn't some free speech absolutist space, it's just a shitty situation.

       If you did say something about Jewish interest like Shapiro attacking Trump you would get banned though.
      </p>

       Any hate speech against Muslims is allowed, you can say goat f%$#%#$ you can even see cartoons of people crapping on the Quran.

       All that hate speech is allowed but if you dare mention something about Kushner's Jewish Extremism or aide to Isreal you will be banned for anti-Semitism.

       I'm a Trump supporter too and agree with a lot of what your saying. The point about mentioning Muslims vs Kushner, have you considered the fact that ones a group and the other is a close advisor and son in law to Trump. Also my opinion on why there is a slant against Muslims for example is that most recent high profile cases of 'hate speech' tend to revolve around Muslims, so I guess they're doubling down. Much like r/dankmemes or r/imgoingtohellforthis targeting blacks and Jews which are hot Button topics.

       A lot of people don't realize this... in fact I don't even this r/the_donald realizes this, but this was a revolution of information, hundreds of thousands of people talked about satanic worshiping, pedos, backroom deals, corruption, 2 party system being a sham, all of this took place on the Donald last summer until now, I don't know if Donald Trump himself is the savior they think he is, but what that community accomplished goes way beyond that, this is why that community certainly belongs on r/conspiracy.
      </p>
      <p>
       In fact today Trump is in Saudi Arabia signing a big weapons deal, if you go to the Donald sub you'll see 75% of people are not happy about it and speaking out, this is what accidental awakening does, in not sure this was their intention, but this is what happened, r/conspiracy should be there for our brothers, I like Trump, but I am not 100% sure of all his actions, but what I am sure about is the momentum and the revolution of the mind and information that the people of the Donald are going through.

       Not at all. Here's what really happened:
      </p>
      <p>
       There was once a large and vibrant independent conspiracy community online. There were always some ridiculous and fake conspiracies mixed in -- but those were tolerated rather than censored.
      </p>
      <p>
       Both parties came along to push a narrative that all conspiracies are crazy.
      </p>
      <p>
       More recently, the Republican Party funneled a good chunk of the conspiracy community into looking only at those conspiracies which made Democrats look bad. I am talking about sites like InfoWars and ZeroHedge, but of course also about pure partisan sites like Breitbart.
      </p>
      <p>
       In response to both the fact that online conspiracy boards began to look more like Republican campaigns and the fact that some of the conspiracies really were crazy, Democrats stepped up their anti-conspiracy ridicule.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then, along comes Donald Trump, the "outsider." He is going to expose these conspiracies and work for the "little guy" -- something he has
       <em>
        never
       </em>
       done. But in the desperation of the population in a continued weak economy, Donald Trump fools some percentage of the conspiracy community, and squeaks out a slim win.

       I think you missed the major point of my comment.
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically what it's trying to say is this;
      </p>
      <p>
       It doesn't matter if they are Republican or Democrat, doesn't matter if Trump was the reason behind their interest in researching given "facts" by media or politicians, trump doesn't matter, what matters is that more and more people are awakened to the state of our lives, the "deep state" that makes decisions behind closed doors without any oversight.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is what's important here, this is why at the end of the day, even if Trump is a liar like all the other politicians, because what he started even he can't close Pandora's box at this point.
