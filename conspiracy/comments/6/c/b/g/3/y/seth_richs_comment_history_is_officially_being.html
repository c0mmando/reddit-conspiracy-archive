       Wait, there is a dot net of that and it is a password generator.  And no instances on google of that being Seth's leaked password.  Are you saying you don't know what the leaked password was?

       Yesterday in a post about what happened to T_D.  Someone posted his passwords and I presume hashes?  I thought it was odd cause it was buried down in replies and was from a throwaway, as in the username had the term throwaway in it.  Had Twitter and a Gmail password.

       Weird. If that did happen and it was actually the correct password that still leaves the major question of why no asterisk appeared. Judging by what I know of the editing system on reddit, that (leaving no trace of an edit occuring) can only be accomplished by an admin editing a comment, which raises a major red flag. Why did an admin edit a dead guys comment and remove identifying email addresses?

       I went and edited one of my comments from 2 years ago and then logged out to confirm that the asterisk shows up next to it afterwards.
      </p>
      <p>
       It does, yet it didn't for the comments edited on Seth Rich's account, meaning that it was edited by an admin. An admin edited several year old comments made by someone who was murdered 10 months ago and who's murder remains unsolved.

       These posts being edited, isn't that tampering with evidence? 
"Murder" victims unsolved murder anything would be considered evidence right?
      </p>
      <p>
       So if Reddit admins tampered with evidence that means they are now complicate in the murder of Seth rich so pretty much Reddit is now an accomplice in the murder of a true American patriot, and that's fucken disgusting.

       I understand what you're saying, but that to me means they would remove the post or account completely not just edit the post to remove the email. To be honest Reddit has done some shady shifty shit in the past year or so. But this is the worst and now I hope karma comes knocking.

       T_D found the password and spammed it all over the internet. It seems reasonable to believe that someone took this password and started deleting things to create this story. Everyone knows everything is archived and deleting things does nothing.

       Someone posted something that claimed to be his passwords to linkedin, dropbox, and fling (dating site). None of them worked but it's possible someone changed them before I was able to test them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Assuming those were real (which is a strong assumption to make considering there was no way of knowing where they came from and if they were even legitimate) it's possible people have access to these accounts and are fucking with shit.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I think it's more likely that the comments are being edited to cover up info instead of just someone trying to fuck with his account.

       Where was that? TBH I have been wracked with stress and guilt since the second I found this account- it was around midnight May 19.  I literally started sweating when I saw his email address and I didn't know what to do or who to turn to, there's no one that can be trusted.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not a tech savvy person so I just archived the entire thing myself on archive.is and wanted to get it into the hands of 4chan and based redditors. My thought was if I posted it at 1 or 2 in the morning US time  the vast amount of US-based corrupt organizations would be asleep and 4chan and Wikileaks people on Seth Rich's side would be able to get most of what they needed before everyone else woke up.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have been terrified I did the wrong thing and allowed his email address to be potentially be compromised but didn't know what else to do, and he was the one who posted it himself from his account ya know.

       that was removed by the mods here for doxxing, but it's still visible on his profile page. However viewing the source of it (from his page) just says deleted so this may be a glitch.
      </p>
      <p>
       I won't repost that information (it'll probably just get deleted), but I did screenshot it incase it is useful later.

       I just downloaded the zip of each archive of his reddit page, should have every post and comment saved now. I'm gonna clean this up (remove unnecessary files) and repost this somewhere.

        I also found that decrypting one of the passwords results in the string "Nothing to do".
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't have a very strong understanding of encryption but other various random strings did not decode the password into the same thing. I don't know the significance of "Nothing to do" but if those passwords were real I assume it has some meaning.

       it could be the admins, but it also could be that people on 4chan are cracking his passwords. If it was the admins would it even show the comments as edited at all, or would they just change like when spez was doing it to someone on T_D?

       The admins have control of the database itself; anyone with that level of control could simply alter your post's content without actually having to edit it. There wouldn't be an "edited" flag.
      </p>
      <p>
       If it's his account - and I have no idea, I have been working on an outboard all day and have read nothing but the comments in this thread - then it is almost certainly someone who simply has control of that account, based on the fact that they are showing as having been edited.
      </p>
      <p>
       Frankly, that alone screams to me that this is definitely some asshole stirring up shit. Editing instead of just deleting. Doing either when it is certainly archived - which also opens the floodgates for fake archive entries.

       Why even bother, though? It simply has the Streisand Effect - which would be particularly bad, if there were important information which needed to be deleted, considering how archived it all is. This only ever had one possible outcome - particularly considering the timing - and that is the generation of more noise, more chaos. All at the low, low price of a dead man's dignity.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyone could have hacked into that account - from a 400lb man on his bed to the Chinese - but what they did with it paints the picture of
       <em>
        why
       </em>
       they did it, and they really helps narrow down who did it. Who did this benefit? Who
       <em>
        could
       </em>
       it have benefited? Exactly who it seems; those so gleefully spreading news of it. It's the tail wagging the dog.

       Editing a comment within the database would not put an asterisk, editing a comment via other means (ie. a edit button from admin tools) would. There is a reason why spez was as able to do it, being knowledgeable in IT (ie a part of the coding of reddit).

       Love him or hate him, Comey gave immunity to people that lied to the FBI and didn't revoke it after he found out.  Supposedly there's no notes or recording of their questioning of Clinton last July. They were never allowed to examine the DNCs supposedly hacked by Russians servers nor did they subpoena them.  Comey mishandled the Clinton investigation, before we even get to the fact that it's not his job to indict people.

       I think the deleted posts is to specifically forward the narrative that pandas4bernie was seth's account. Because people keep claiming they stopped posting at the same time, but seth had actually posted a whole month after pandas4bernie stopped. But after the deletions, his last post is the same time the other reddit account stopped.

       That's pretty dumb... the Pandas4Bernie account was way less active than Seth's account to begin with. A lot of people have a main account that they could be identified by and then a secret account. You don't have to post in both accounts on the exact same schedule.
      </p>
      <p>
       The main point is both accounts are silent now.

       But look how many people say they stopped posting at the same time, but pandas4bernie stopped when bernie was mathmatically eliminated, didnt post much to begin with, and was a political account. so the fact that there was a month gap between their last posts IS pretty signifigant against that narrative.
      </p>
      <p>
       I didn't see anything missing other than the last month of posts, and the editing out of the email, so that seems to be the intent to me. If it was a 4chan troll misdirection(people have said his passwords got posted there last night?) it doesnt have to really be helpful to anyone

       Well I meant the deleters were trying to convince people that pandas4bernie was his account by making the last post line up better, but no theory really makes a ton of sense, cause for reddit admins i get editing the email, but why delete the other random ones in a row, and I doubt theyre stupid enough to think noone would notice(which doesnt mean someone in there didnt do it as a troll to kick the beehive, they are stupid enough to do that)

       Ok hear me out here. This is conspiracy right. Seth Rich leaks stuff to Russia or Wikileaks or whoever. If he dies and he is exposed as a leaker who does it make look terrible? Hillary. Now don't confuse me with a Hillary supporter because I'm not but it doesn't make sense to me her team would kill him after the leaks or even if they suspected him. It makes more sense that if he was leaking to a group that had an anti Hillary agenda why not look at that group.  Whether it be Wikileaks or Russian intelligence masquerading as Wikileaks or some other intelligence agency whether state sponsored or not. I don't have all the facts, all I know is he is dead and it's a tragedy. I think for those of us that consider ourselves good critical thinkers it is a mistake to exclude the people he was leaking to from the list of suspects. I wouldn't put it past Hillary or her team to commit or sponsor murder they just have the most to lose from his death. And the most to gain from punishing him in the judicial system for being a leaker.

       Must've been a black hat. It's not that easy for the average Joe to get inside gmail accounts, though. We're looking at 2-factor authentication, having the right IP, getting locked out after multiple attempts, etc.

       If someone got in, it'd likely be an Alphabet. Possibly even Google itself.

       Keep in mind that when the Clinton cabal killed Braverman, Google's CEO covered it up by "giving him a job" in his foundation. If you believe he's working there I have a beach front property in New Mexico to sell you.

       Even if Rich's emails were discovered, they've gotten too much of a head start.

       I absolutely hope the hunt continues, but even if the log-in is successful I'm not banking on there being the smoking gun. It'd be long gone, unless anons know how to retrieve deleted emails.

       I just think its likely because shortly after the passwords went out the recovery phone got changed, and the posts started getting deleted(and the two confirmed accounts having two different phones suggests a mad dash to gain access to the accounts by multiple people)

       So what? Let's assume the most insidious situation. Some shadow cabal that murdered Seth Rich is trying to cover it up by deleting a single post from his reddit account. Why?
      </p>
      <p>
       What do they gain by doing this? It's already known that was him. Any cabal that has the knowledge and planning to go through with this kind of murder would know how internet archives works.
      </p>
      <p>
       So through basic logic we can rule out that the cabal is responsible for this edit. So who did do who? Who stands to gain from the edit?

       I don't think that someone on those websites would intentionally delete those just to feel right like you're arguing. Someone posted them online, but that's a good tactic to cover your tracks. This has been done before.

       Maybe it has something to do with T_D leaking the passwords? Just tossing that out there.

       I'd say that any edits being made to his posts are a complete non-starter since his account password has supposedly been floating around on the internet for days now, literally anyone could be making the edits, including the people "exposing" this "coverup," but I don't have the energy for another debate with the Kek Collective right now.

       I don't have the energy to point out that tweets or screenshots of tweets are the exact opposite of a credible source.

       I don't have the energy to point out that there is zero evidence Seth Rich was leaking to wikileaks aside from a private eye hired by a 3rd party, not the family, coming forward and saying there's evidence of it on Seth's computer, which he hasn't seen or had access to. I don't have the energy to point out that 3rd party was likely one of the Kek crew.

       I believe that is tampering with evidence. Whoever changed his profile should be arrested.

       Pretty secure password.  Wonder how it was cracked.  Wonder why he chose those words given his fascination with pandas.

       Wait, there is a dot net of that and it is a password generator.  And no instances on google of that being Seth's leaked password.  Are you saying you don't know what the leaked password was?
