    <div class="md"><p>Weird. If that did happen and it was actually the correct password that still leaves the major question of why no asterisk appeared. Judging by what I know of the editing system on reddit, that (leaving no trace of an edit occuring) can only be accomplished by an admin editing a comment, which raises a major red flag. Why did an admin edit a dead guys comment and remove identifying email addresses? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I went and edited one of my comments from 2 years ago and then logged out to confirm that the asterisk shows up next to it afterwards.</p>

<p>It does, yet it didn&#39;t for the comments edited on Seth Rich&#39;s account, meaning that it was edited by an admin. An admin edited several year old comments made by someone who was murdered 10 months ago and who&#39;s murder remains unsolved.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not only immoral and suspicious as fuck, it could also be described as an attempt to obstruct justice.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not a tech savvy person so I just archived the entire thing myself on archive.is and wanted to get it into the hands of 4chan and based redditors. My thought was if I posted it at 1 or 2 in the morning US time  the vast amount of US-based corrupt organizations would be asleep and 4chan and Wikileaks people on Seth Rich&#39;s side would be able to get most of what they needed before everyone else woke up.</p>

<p>I have been terrified I did the wrong thing and allowed his email address to be potentially be compromised but didn&#39;t know what else to do, and he was the one who posted it himself from his account ya know.</p>

It makes more sense that if he was leaking to a group that had an anti Hillary agenda why not look at that group.  Whether it be Wikileaks or Russian intelligence masquerading as Wikileaks or some other intelligence agency whether state sponsored or not. I don&#39;t have all the facts, all I know is he is dead and it&#39;s a tragedy. I think for those of us that consider ourselves good critical thinkers it is a mistake to exclude the people he was leaking to from the list of suspects. I wouldn&#39;t put it past Hillary or her team to commit or sponsor murder they just have the most to lose from his death. And the most to gain from punishing him in the judicial system for being a leaker.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Must&#39;ve been a black hat. It&#39;s not that easy for the average Joe to get inside gmail accounts, though. We&#39;re looking at 2-factor authentication, having the right IP, getting locked out after multiple attempts, etc.</p>

<p>If someone got in, it&#39;d likely be an Alphabet. Possibly even Google itself.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that when the Clinton cabal killed Braverman, Google&#39;s CEO covered it up by &quot;giving him a job&quot; in his foundation. If you believe he&#39;s working there I have a beach front property in New Mexico to sell you. </p>

<p>Even if Rich&#39;s emails were discovered, they&#39;ve gotten too much of a head start.</p>

<p>I absolutely hope the hunt continues, but even if the log-in is successful I&#39;m not banking on there being the smoking gun. It&#39;d be long gone, unless anons know how to retrieve deleted emails.</p>

<p>What do they gain by doing this? It&#39;s already known that was him. Any cabal that has the knowledge and planning to go through with this kind of murder would know how internet archives works.</p>

<p>So through basic logic we can rule out that the cabal is responsible for this edit. So who did do who? Who stands to gain from the edit? </p>
