       I don't mind Trump supporters utilizing this subreddit as long as they keep an open mind. I think they could learn a lot in general.
      </p>
      <p>
       If we come across shitposts let's try to educate them and provide resources. I get we are all busy and have other priorities but there is a ton of users here that are very knowledgeable that can contribute. You couldn't do that on the_donald without getting banned so essentially the sub was a group of users that hold on to the same false rhetoric.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think it would also be beneficial if someone made a post about how one could go about researching a political topic.
      </p>
      <p>
       Something positive I've noticed from the average trump supporter is that they are on point about certain topics. But they are still far from an awakening. They tend to hold on to many intolerant views which essentially does make it difficult to get through to them.
      </p>
      <p>
       For instance, the whole "fake news" hype is technically correct. Our mainstream media is basically yellow journalism at its finest. It's filled with fear-mongering bullshit and propaganda. We have to approach anything mainstream media feeds us with skepticism. We should always look at all sides of a topic to fully comprehend the entire picture.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump supporters are selective in the propaganda they follow and tend to view politics as essentially black and white. In reality it's complex and everything is interconnected. Putting those pieces together can be difficult as it does take a lot of time and effort.

       Hillary is crooked, I know this very well but that isn't what I'm talking about. It isn't about Hillary vs Trump. I honestly would say Trump &gt; Hillary but realize that all politicians have an agenda to abide by.  The point of my comment wasn't to generalize Trump supporters as this post is about the_donald. Most of the users in the_donald hold on to very similar viewpoints, I don't see how my comment is even offensive.

       Actually if you ever do get a chance to travel to parts of the world yjr msm focuses in on, you will realize that what we consider to be conspiracy is often truth. I wouldn't take pride in electing a president like Trump. I would prefer a Dr. Ron Paul.

       Okay I agree with that if Trump is successful at defeating the deep state. I don't have a problem with Trump, I'm still trying to formulate a coherent opinion on him. He seems to be wiser than many of us think. Some of his moves I agree with, other times he seems like a puppet. It may be a good thing that we can't really figure him out though. But now that I've mentioned the deep state, let me also mention that many Trump supporters are very supportive of Zionism. I think it is a complete contradiction...and that is what my comment was trying to convey.

       If the mods want to let this become a T_D safehaven where they are going to just spam shitpost all day just let me know so I can unsubscribe.  It was already borderline overly influenced by their drippings.  I have no issues with Trump supporters, I have a lot of issues with Trump supporters and mods who can't take conversation or criticism and would prefer to just cry/report/ban to solve the issue of a conflicting PoV.  Or the ones who believe that posting 50 things about Seth Rich will invalidate the cesspool of shit Trump's administration is in.  They're like a version of North Koreans following their Kim Jong Un the only difference is I believe North Koreans are more aware of how fucked up Kim is than Trump supporters are of Donald.

       Crying "shill" is the most common way to handle a critical POV, from my experience.

       That's being exceptionally nice - literally the only place on all of Reddit that you can be critical of Trump (and not really, you have to phrase questions in a non-critical fashion) is
       <a href="/r/AskTrumpSupporters">
        /r/AskTrumpSupporters
       </a>
       .  So I give props to the small bastion of them there who are actually willing to think about and answer people without resorting to bans or cries of shills.

       Agree with other post: "Trumpsters" are welcome as long as they remember that this in NOT a
       <em>
        political
       </em>
       sub annd they don't get crazy with Trump posts. There has always been "conspriracy" in politics but we gotta keep it real.

       One final thing that has come to my mind.
      </p>
      <p>
       I live in the South, in a very conservative state. I'm probably what every Trump supporter considers to be the enemy. Most people here get to know me and at first they don't know that I'm a Palestinian Muslim American.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the 20-something years of my existence, I have essentially dealt with humans that have expressed their hatred of my whole entire identity. [No I'm not looking for sympathy I find it comical]. As much as I want to resent these people, I never could blame them for the way they think. I realized early on that they are just a victim of brainwashing. Misinformation is so rampant, it is indeed an insult to humanity's intelligence.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've developed extremely thick skin towards insensitive people. I don't get offended but instead I engage with these individuals. I think its counterproductive to just ignore and dismiss someone as a bigot. I have changed the minds of many and I've also learned a lot from others too. So my point is if I can be tolerant, I think its important that we all are as well.
