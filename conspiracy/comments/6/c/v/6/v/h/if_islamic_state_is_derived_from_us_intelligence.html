       If it is conservatives who claim the U.S created ISIS and it is really private money that is funding and arming  them, and who also seem to be working with Russia to dismantle EU and NATO,  who would you accuse?

       You replied with a hypotheical AND seem to buy into the Russia stories. No one mentioned Russia here, so don't try to distract from what's going on and the point of this post. Don't try to categorize me as "conservative" when all I want is the truth and for this shit to stop, because it is a rich man's game and the citizens of the world are their chess pieces.

       It certainly wasn't clear before. And what makes you think it's the Russians? There's no evidence of the last Russia narrative and thus far there's no evidence that they are backing this situation either.

       True no evidence, and the only evidence so far it is ISIS is the public claim by someone claiming to be "the Islamic State," what ever that is, and the whatever seems to be whenever it is needed for the propaganda.

       I didn't.  I don't claim ISIS is supported by the U.S. Government I have mentioned that it is very possible they are a useful tool of some anti-national government private money and Russia and possibly a tiny bit by China.

       Why are you so against Russia? Why not North Korea? Saudi Arabia? Turkey? Pakistan? China? Syria? Why do you pull Russia out of a hat? I'll tell you why. Because your perception of reality has been controlled to a point where Russia will always be the bad guy to you no matter how little evidence there  is. You have been ideologically subverted.

       I don't know that Korea is meddling in our elections.  Turkey is a long time US Ally and a NATO member.  Pakistan has been a useful tool, China made all our billionaires wealther, Syria has been a persistent enemy against the U.S. client state Israel and Saudi Arabia was created specifically to protect U.S. investment in their oil.  It has produced billions in profits for some of the U.S.'s most wealthy individuals.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only simplicity in all of this is protecting the wealthiest at great expense to ordinary U.S. citizens. Nearly 100 years of hegemony, that has done just that

       The point is that you are simply pulling Russia out of a hat. You ask why anyone would support Russia? Since when does not pinning everything that is bad in the world on Russia mean someone is supportive? Saying someone supports Russia because they don't blindly follow manufactured narratives really makes no sense.
      </p>
      <p>
       Russia is not the devil. Stop acting like they are simply because you are told they are.

       To me the strongest evidence is that the U.S. President imposed sanctions against Russia based on information provided by the U.S. intelligence agencies and that there was no push back from EU or NATO nations for those sanctions which were trade related.

       You also just changed the subject from meddling in u.s. elections to influencing government.

       The irony of it all is the best part. Don't you find it ironic to be accusing a foreign country of influencing American government when America has their nose in countless elections and coup' s all over the globe? American arrogance will be their ultimate downfall.

       I'm nothing to Russia.  I don't think about Russia because they have no role in anything.  They are the go-to scapegoat when they need to blame shit on someone because the Cold War conditioned people to always think of Russia as the bad guy regardless of any evidence.
