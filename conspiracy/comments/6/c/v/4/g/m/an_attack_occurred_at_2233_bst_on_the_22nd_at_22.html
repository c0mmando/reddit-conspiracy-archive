        Carried out by a 22 year-old.

       How many "coincidences" do you need before you accept that there are no coincidences?  Seriously, pick a number and start counting.  It's simply a matter of time before you find them.
      </p>
      <p>
       We're quietly told again and again, "they're just numbers."  Meanwhile, TPTB plan and pull events like last night's bombing to coincide with all these parallels.  They're practically flaunting it
       <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-manchester-40010124">
        in this article:
       </a>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        It is the worst terrorist attack in the UK since the 7 July bombings in 2005, in which 52 people were killed by four suicide bombers.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       7th day of the 7th month in 2005 (2+0+0+5=7) where 52 (5+2=7) people died.
      </p>
      <p>
       We throw around the term 'TPTB' quite liberally here because it's an easy way to create an undefined, shared enemy.  But who do you think The Powers That Be really are?  Who could possibly coordinate these events to such detail that they control not only the when, the where, and the what but also how many victims there will be?
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you think terrorists can do that?
      </p>
      <p>
       How about our governments?
      </p>
      <p>
       Masons?  The Illuminati?  Do you think they're that coordinated?
      </p>
      <p>
       What about
       <em>
        aliens
       </em>
       ?  You want to blame all this on extraterrestrials?
      </p>
      <p>
       Or might TPTB be a part of something far more cosmic?
      </p>
      <p>
       Society will provide you with a never-ending list of boogeymen.  It's time to
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allegory_of_the_Cave">
        come out of the cave
       </a>
       and see the metagame being played around you.  Someone
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/predictions/comments/6clshm/fire_at_the_grand_scarborough_england">
        symbolically-predicted this would happen through their dreams.

        that demons walk the earth and are trying to corrupt him, and that the only way he can expose them is by asking them directly if they are demons, which he does to everyone he meets.

       Overview
      </p>
      <p>
       Beedrill shines in the UU metagame thanks to its Mega Evolution, which, by way of amazing Attack and Speed stats and Adaptability, grants it the strongest U-turn in the tier, letting it pummel offensive and defensive teams alike. It can grab offensive momentum with very little trouble thanks to the aforementioned qualities, which makes it one of the best offensive Pokemon in the tier. However, Beedrill has a somewhat shallow movepool aside from its STAB attacks, and it only has access to Knock Off and Drill Run as offensive coverage moves. It also has pitiful defensive stats, as well as a mediocre defensive typing. It also is forced to run Protect so that it can Mega Evolve and get the Speed boost without taking damage, as its Speed before Mega Evolving is decent at best. Despite these flaws, Beedrill is still a fantastic Pokemon, and it should always be considered when making an offensive team.

      <p>
       Moves
      </p>
      <p>
       U-turn is Beedrill's main STAB move, as it nets Beedrill offensive momentum with little trouble and is useful to get some chip damage. Protect is used so that Beedrill can get the Speed boost from Mega Evolving without taking any damage and is also useful to scout for foes' movesets and potential Choice items. Poison Jab is Beedrill's strongest attack, as well as its main Poison-type STAB attack, and it has a fairly high chance to poison the target, which works well in conjunction with Protect to rack up damage on the foe while scouting for its moveset. Knock Off hits Ghost-types such as Chandelure for super effective damage and also cripples Pokemon reliant on their item. Drill Run is mainly used for coverage, as it hits Poison- and Steel-types that resist Beedrill's STAB attacks, such as Tentacruel, Nidoking, Nidoqueen, and Lucario, for super effective damage.
      </p>
      <p>
       Set Details
      </p>
      <p>
       A standard EV spread is used to max out Beedrill's offensive prowess, with the remaining EVs in Defense so it can maintain an odd HP number. A Jolly nature is used so Beedrill can Speed tie with other base 145 Speed Pokemon, such as Mega Sceptile and opposing Beedrill. An Adamant nature can be used instead to give Beedrill a little extra power.
      </p>
      <p>
       Usage Tips
      </p>
      <p>
       Protect should be used the first turn Beedrill is sent out if the opposing Pokemon is faster, as it lets Beedrill safely Mega Evolve and attain the Speed boost without taking damage, scouting the foe's moveset in the process. Although it has poor defensive stats, Beedrill's decent defensive typing gives it 4x resistances it can use to switch in. However, some powerful physical moves such as Mienshao's Reckless High Jump Kick have a shot at 2HKOing it, although Beedrill can use Protect to scout and potentially make Mienshao take crash damage. Beedrill can grab momentum with little trouble thanks to its strong U-turn and high Speed stat, so pairing it with entry hazard users is a good idea. Keeping entry hazards off your side of the field is appreciated, as Beedrill will be switching out more than often due to U-turn and can be KOed by priority users after Stealth Rock damage.
      </p>
      <p>
       Team Options
      </p>
      <p>
       Entry hazard support is appreciated, as Beedrill can force out a good portion of the tier and grab offensive momentum easily with U-turn. As such, entry hazard setters such as Swampert, Roserade, Froslass, and Chesnaught are good partners for Beedrill. Spikes in particular also works well with Beedrill, as it weakens most of Beedrill's grounded checks. Entry hazard removers also work well with Beedrill, as it is weak to Stealth Rock and will be switching in and out very often, so Empoleon, Donphan, and Gligar, the latter forming a nice momentum core with Beedrill, are good partners for it. Other U-turn and Volt Switch users, such as Crobat, work like a charm when paired up with Beedrill, as they can pivot out to Beedrill with little trouble and keep up offensive momentum.
      </p>
      <p>
       Other Options
      </p>
      <p>
       X-Scissor can be used over U-turn if you feel that keeping up offensive momentum is not necessary, as it hits for more damage. Swords Dance can be used to boost Beedrill's attack immensely, but Beedrill usually does not have the room to run this and finds it difficult to set up. If it does manage to set up, it can still get revenge killed easily by priority and Choice Scarf users, so running Swords Dance is not usually worth the loss of coverage. Toxic Spikes can be used to wear down some of Beedrill's switch-ins, such as Alomomola and Porygon2, making it easier for Beedrill to deal with them later in the game. Pursuit is an option to cause significant damage to fleeing Ghost-types and Psychic-types, such as Reuniclus and Chandelure.
      </p>
      <p>
       Checks and Counters
      </p>
      <p>
       Stealth Rock: As Beedrill uses U-turn often, it generally does not stay in for long periods of time. Passive damage from Stealth Rock wears down Beedrill quickly and pressures it to stay off the field.
      </p>
      <p>
       Choice Scarf Users and Faster Pokemon: Because Beedrill has a very high Speed stat, Choice Scarf users such as Hydreigon and Darmanitan can take it on. It should be noted, however, that Beedrill outspeeds Choice Scarf users that aren't above base 80 Speed. Mega Aerodactyl outspeeds Mega Beedrill and OHKOes it with its STAB attacks.
      </p>
      <p>
       Priority Attacks: Beedrill's pitiful defenses make it extremely susceptible to priority, such as Lucario and Entei's Extreme Speed and Fletchinder's Acrobatics.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bulky Steel-types: Due to their huge physical bulk and defensive typing, Mega Aggron, Doublade, and Forretress scoff at all of Beedrill's attacks and can OHKO it with their Steel-type STAB attacks. However, Doublade doesn't like having its Eviolite Knocked Off.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bulky Pokemon that Resist Beedrill's STAB Attacks: Pokemon that can tank Beedrill's STAB attacks and recover the damage, such as Gligar and Crobat, make for good answers to Beedrill and are a pain for Beedrill to face. Tentacruel also resists both STAB moves and has decent Defense, but it is vulnerable to Drill Run and gets worn down fairly easily.
      </p>
      <p>
       Physical Walls: Pokemon with high physical bulk like Alomomola and Suicune can tank Beedrill's STAB attacks and heal off the damage taken with Wish and Rest, respectively, while forcing Beedrill out due to the chance of a Scald burn.

       There are some things that just aren't opinions. If you can use the scientific method to conclusively prove that your numbers have magical powers, I'm more than willing to listen to you. Until then I'm not going to waste my time studying and learning or even caring about something that has just as much credibility as Alchemy or dowsing rods.

       Let me play devil's advocate here. I do not believe in magic or numerology either, the numbers have no physical power for they are not physical constructs(all numbers are imaginary). What if the numbers are evidence of something greater, perhaps a pattern. THe numbers just act as a constant by which to measure an effect. Let's say that pattern shows up at a rather infrequent rate on important historical dates or tragedies. Is that coincidence or some type of evidence?

       I would be open to that discussion if that was what was going on here. But unfortunately the majority of people seem to be drawing conclusions where there are none and thinking that numbers actually have mystical powers. That's what I'm arguing against. That's what throws people off when they look up conspiracy theories and see this shit.

       The scientific method is a means by which one attempts to exclude magical influence. By definition it looks at general trends, and that cancels out all magical anomalies, which only act specifically.
      </p>
      <p>
       From my perspective, you are applying pressure in a magical sense to cause your world to conform to a model wherein whatever it is you consider magic to be remains hidden.
      </p>
      <p>
       I used to be a scientist (organic chemist), and I can tell you that the rigidity of that worldview rapidly falls away as soon as you embrace another.

       It's not about having "magical or mythical" numbers. It's about telling the truth in plain sight. Whoever runs this world "TBTB" OBVIOUSLY use symbolism whether you want to believe it or not; THEY DO. Now carry on and continue consuming my friend.

       She was making a joke. You really have to be legitimately mentally ill to believe she was giving a public speech exposing some sort of grand conspiracy centered around numerology and the Illuminati.

       Thank you for the effort your reply must have taken. I realize you've reached the pinnacle of your capability here. Your refutation, which boils down to "you are mentally ill and here is a link from business insider that agrees with me", might seem irrefutable to you at first.

       You seem unable to understand that you don't need to be superstitious yourself in order for others to be so. I know the distinction is subtle, but try giving it some extra thought. Anyway I'll spare myself the trivial demonstration that the central planners are superstitious fucks indeed.

       I'm not going to waste my time engaging an actual argument against people showing one of the most common signs of paranoid schizophrenia. Case in point, the OP of this thread is internet famous for making long rambling posts about how demons are literally walking the Earth and trying to control him. His criteria for determining if someone is a demon is if they don't support him or question his mental health. Literally a self-sustaining vicious cycle.

       There gets to be a point where calling someone else insane stops being ad hominem it starts to be calling of people showing severe red flags.

       That is worth the read but isn't exactly accurate. Someone cant understand these numbers and their significance​ without basic understanding of geometry. For example 7. Take 6
       <em>
        pennies
       </em>
       notice how they will fit perfectly around the 7th? Do the same with
       <em>
        bowling
       </em>
       balls and you get 13. 12 bowling balls fit around 1. 13 is the 3D version of 7. The 13 bowling ball shape can represent unity and is one reason why the
       <em>
        United
       </em>
       states flag has 13 stripes. Anybody feel like calculating the size ratio to make 32 circles or spheres to make them fit  around the one larger one?

       I generally don't use that term. I just like math, geometry, and the concepts that come about when analyzing them. I found this thread interesting even though it seems a lot of people who I respect are dogging it. I guess it is because it is not actually
       <em>
        useful
       </em>
       information. As in what the hell do you with knowing some 22 year old kid managed to kill 22 people on may 22? Also, I did not see any sources for the coordinates having 22 in them. Maybe I should ask OP.

       11, 22, and all other repeating numbers are considered "master numbers" in numerology.  I'm not an expert but from what I've learned the energies of these numbers vibrate across the multiverse.  33 is said to be the highest level of compassion a human can hope to obtain.
      </p>
      <p>
       My theory is that these "terror" events are staged at these times and locations in order to add fear to the vibration of these numbers.

       He was very much off the grid and was let go on short notice... But you're right I really should've kept in touch with him. He was a Cebsus worker before he was a classics professor. One of the nicest guys I've met honestly

       I have to say, I do think the numerology thing is a bit of a reach (no offence btw).  However...  When the 7/7 bombings happened here, what I thought was that it was a date that had a certain significance in that it complimented the American way of writing dates.  Obviously you know 9/11 would be 11/9 to British people and I thought it was kind of convenient that it worked for both sides of the channel.

       Religion is bullshit. YAHUWA said, all you have to do to reach him, is come through the son YAHUSHA! Do you know what we are supposed to tilde? Food! For the poor. Not money. Religion is 3rd dimensional thinking. No man can be the gatekeeper for the Creator. Every religion has lied to us. I was a cross wearing Christian because I was told about pagan things like wearing the Egyptian cross. And the trinity bullshit. They didn't tell me Jesus was hung from a tree. I use to think we were here on a small speck in the cosmos because we are insignificant. They didn't tell me YAHUWA made us the center of the universe. They didn't tell me who the Hebrews really are. I was made to worship a false image of the Messiah and to hate myself, I was made to feel worthless in your Egyptian land, descendant of slaves. I was told and show over and over how worthless I was over and over. It was just shut the fuck up and know your place nigger. If they church told me who I really was, perhaps I would not have hated myself for almost my entire life.

       It was a lot of crying, meditating and praying and after I basically broke myself down to nothing, I built myself back up. it's important that you never let someone else break you down and build you back up, that's what keeps cults in business. And it was also finding teachers who were doctrinally correct. And you may be asking how do you know if someone is doctrinally correct...

       In "the pyramid code" on Netflix there was a segment in which a local mystic (for lack of a more appropriate term) described how at one time everyone in that area was enlightened and lived in peace. Over time, some of the more influential in the spiritual community used the fear of death to manipulate people into giving them money/things to ensure their soul would be safe. It's all part of the great cycles of time, there are periods of enlightenment and periods of darkness. Organised religion has been used as a tool of control for millennia, plus people feel better when they are part of a group.

       I may have seen that. I use to wonder why I was so interested in Egyptian history. Now it makes sense, since AMURKA is the new location of Egypt. We even have the pyramid on our money. They don't even try to hide it. And just like Ancient Egypt was conquered by the Greeks and Romans so are we still beholden to the Roman Empire to this day.

       And the real Hebrews are black? Jesus was black?
      </p>
      <p>
       I ask this because I'm a direct descendent from an indigenous ancient middle eastern civilisation that has a history that surpasses the Hebrews and Egyptians and a bloodline that has the least amount of mixing amongst the entire Middle East. We are not black, I've seen Black Hebrews claim our ancestors are black when genetic testing and one of the most widely recorded histories in this world show clearly our ancestors were never black.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not that I think colour matters, but it's ridiculous when people want to claim others history as theirs. Everyone wants to feel like they are the chosen race, enlightened and elevated by Dieties, this has been the case since the beginning of time.

       Have you been to the Middle East? Have you seen the wide array of shades humans come in depending on the terrain they originate from? Obviously there was dark skinned as well as light skinned people but to say that they were all black (African black as is being claimed) is incorrect even using your sources.

       noo dude, most of the ancients where black( not african )
 evolution teaches us that survival of the fittest right. how long can you stay on the beach in the summer before you get a sunburn? lets reframe that question, how long would you be able to work on the fields or hunt outdoors under a burning sun? 
 and dont say that white evolved because of cooler climates in the north. if that was true then the Eskimos would all be blond and blue eyed ( they have shorter arms and legs to preserve heat, they are built for cooler climates )
      </p>
      <p>
       you cant look at people today and say ohh gee i bet they looked like that a couple of thousand years ago. and if we say that most of the ancient where black, then where did white come from? the answer is in the runes boy.. learn a litel bit about the runes cus they are thousand of years older then Odin and his viking death cult

       I don't want to go back and forth with you, you can see from the previous links you sent there were pale white people as well as darker skinned people living on this earth at the same time in the ancient world. To say the entire ancient world was black is incorrect as even within a country terrain and temperature varies and one single skin type would not 'work' from an evolutionary standpoint, not all ancient civilisations worked the fields in the sun.

       I'm kidding i know what actual enlightenment is - the ones that will fall under the alien they might bring out at the satanic vatican isn't the Light - just go watch NDE experiences of the light and watch people cry their eyes out for hours experiences a love so intense they they dissolve entirely into it - and become one with absolutely everything in existence - i've worked with ayahuasca shamans and know what demons are and their energy - etc - it's all a dream - light is the answer and is always here - ok i'm done now :)

       Everything that exists does so as a vibration or "energy".  You yourself are a vibration unique in the whole of existence.  Numbers are no different.  They too have a unique vibration that permeates through spacetime.
      </p>
      <p>
       The key difference?  Numbers have a set vibration where your vibration can change.  Meditation, among other things, will help you raise it.

       Numbers aren't made of matter, though. They're concepts. You can't touch a "one," it is an idea that has to be expressed through some medium whether it be a singular object or conveyed as a symbol. I suppose you could argue that the electrical impulses that encode for these ideas vibrate at different energies.

       Pick some random numbers from those above and make 22. Divide by the square root of zebra = illuminati.

       I'm being a bit harsh, but this number stuff is a red herring. You can make any event seem significant if you look hard enough for the right numbers.

       No it's not. Why choose longitude, date (but not month), hour (in 24-hr notation) and minute to go with deaths? There are literally a million things you can scout around for. The problem is that a particular tragedy like this will spit out a 1000 statistics. Number of police. Age of people dying. Ariana's N
       <sup>
        th
       </sup>
       concert. The N

       parliament. Manchester is the 2nd largest city (2 again!). It's been N months since the last terror incident. And so on and so forth. Literally hundreds of things to dig up. The fact that these 4 or 5 statistics line up is
       <em>
        meaningless.
       </em>
       The human brain is wired and often desperate to seek out connections where none exist. Notice that these random connections are never the same across different events. You've got 5-6 coincidental things about this attack but 5-6
       <em>
        different
       </em>
       things about some other attack (such as 9/11).

       I'd have to dig up as much numerical data as I can on the event - the number of ambulances, the number of casualties, the number of songs in Grande's set, the number of seats in the stadium, the number of tickets sold, the number of days/months since other significant events etc etc.

       My first thought is that you can easily confirm your bias if you try hard enough.  But on the other hand, these are some absurd coincidences.  In a different thread a guy linked like 15 articles detailing incidents where there were 22 dead.

      <p>
       So when op says:

       And now that the thought is in your head, you're going to start looking around at your own life and see how there's no coincidences there either.

       Time for clean undies, you're going to have some

       <em>

       is basically a rewrite of ancient Sumerian myths.  The entity you know as 'Satan' is really
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enki">

       , one of two brothers fighting for control.

       That's duality, pretty standard 3rd dimensional worship. The 1st dimension is the realm of the many Gods. That's where you hear about legends like Zeus and Beowulf. The second is the realm of the master and the slave. Anything you read or watch is from this dimension. 3rd Dimension is duality. The Ying Yang. Man vs Woman. The realm is devoid of magic and has trillions of planets. Here in the 4th Dimension magic is real. It is the center of all known creation. It's where the one true God lives, YAHUAH, and his only begotten son, YAHUSHA!

       The entire bible. That includes the parts the Roman Empire and Christian's are trying to hide from you like the Book of Enoch, Giants, Jasper etc.. because the truth is We are not supposed to go to any church ran by man. Can you see why they try to hide this from you?

       Interestingly, several eye witnesses on Utøya reported seeing more than one gunman.

       Behring Breivik is coincidentally also the son of a high-ranking, shady diplomat associated with the Norwegian Labour party.

       It happened on 22/05/17...does that mean anything? Or are we only analysing dates if they fall into a pattern which we've created ourself?

Both come down to 2 or two depending on whether you include the full year or not.

       eep your comment has 22 points =/

      <p>
       So I noticed something similar after the disappearance of flight 370 when the 37's started piling up.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even though I only mentioned it originally in passing and didn't put too much weight on it,
       <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/axolotl_peyotl/comments/21rpeg/so_my_high_octane_speculation_about_the/">
        it somehow was picked up by Time.com and then mentioned on the Colbert Report
       </a>
       which was just bizarre.
      </p>
      <p>
       When I heard that 22 people reported to have died, I automatically had a feeling it must've been on the 22nd of the month (I had to check...I didn't remember the date briefly). I then thought to myself that there probably was going to be one male perpetrator, and I would be surprised if he
       <em>
        wasn't
       </em>
       22 (I shit you not).
      </p>
      <p>
       There's a pattern to these things. These are rituals.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like 9/11,
       <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/axolotl_peyotl/comments/21roh5/911_aleister_crowley_and_nefarious_numerology_was/">
        these numbers are ritualistic in natural and riddled with occult significance.
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       It doesn't matter if you don't believe in it,
       <em>
        they
       </em>
       do. It's a signature.
      </p>
      <p>
       If more (or less) than 22 people end up dying as a result of this, it still doesn't matter...what matters is what is reported.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        It becomes more obvious when you see the numbers pushed frequently as a focal point. They want our energy focused on that number.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I agree completely. Fascinating stuff.

       This isn't about ancient civilizations(we'll maybe creating the lost one). Weaves quite the web though of history and occult societies. Helps paint the picture of how and why the world is the way it is. People just love to call false flag when there's a lot more at play.

       Madrid Train Bombings 3/11/2004:  3+1+1+2+4 adds up to 11, day of attack

       Brussels Bombings were on 3/22/2016

       its just a bunch of disconnected numbers that dont mean anything, its so obviously a coincidence.  The idea that TBTB killed exactly 22 people in order for that number to line up with the date.  WHY?? This is like charlie day in the basement and pepe silvio. Are you being serious because this is a hilarious satire of conspiracy people who have their brains fried.  There are conspiracies but a bunch of coincidental 22s is not one of them

       Why on Earth would they want to do this? It makes no sense. It's purely coincidental.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's assume I'm part of some NWO org and want to do this to do whatever false flag. I can wait 2 minutes, I can wait 2 hours. Why would I need to do it specifically at this time? The effect I want occurs regardless of the time.
      </p>
      <p>
       Secondly, let's continue to assume I'm some big baddie orchestrating something and I know there's communities across the world and the internet who are on to me, know that me and my friends all use crazy numbers just to gloat to ourselves and trick the sheeple, wouldn't we ya know, stop doing shit to reveal ourselves like using numerology? Now they have even more evidence it was us! Oh no!

       Lol. I think they the elites think they are not human like you and me. They think they have some special bloodline that dates back to ancient times. That is a big deal to them. Royals consider themselves decenedants of the gods. That was their belief not mine and though it is not widely accepted anymore. I suspect the elites of the old bloodlines still hold the belief that they are descendant of the gods. 
What I was saying is just because you use common sense does not mean that the elites use common sense.

       It's almost like the advantages outweigh the obviousness of it.  Like there's far more than stake than you may realize.  Besides, didn't your TV tell you numerology is fake?  All coincidences here.

       Now this is a post I can get behind! Good job bringing all this up, they really do plan attacks to happen with specific numbers involved. Take 9/11 for example, the square of 9 is 3, and multiple 11 by 2 and you get 3/22....322 the number of the Skull &amp; Bones society.

       11, 22, and all other repeating numbers are considered "master numbers" in numerology.  I'm not an expert but from what I've learned the energies of these numbers vibrate across the multiverse.  33 is said to be the highest level of compassion a human can hope to obtain.
      </p>
      <p>
       My theory is that these "terror" events are staged at these times and locations in order to add fear to the vibration of these numbers.

       Numbers aren't made of matter, though. They're concepts. You can't touch a "one," it is an idea that has to be expressed through some medium whether it be a singular object or conveyed as a symbol. I suppose you could argue that the electrical impulses that encode for these ideas vibrate at different energies.

       I'm not going to waste my time engaging an actual argument against people showing one of the most common signs of paranoid schizophrenia. Case in point, the OP of this thread is internet famous for making long rambling posts about how demons are literally walking the Earth and trying to control him. His criteria for determining if someone is a demon is if they don't support him or question his mental health. Literally a self-sustaining vicious cycle.

       I may have seen that. I use to wonder why I was so interested in Egyptian history. Now it makes sense, since AMURKA is the new location of Egypt. We even have the pyramid on our money. They don't even try to hide it. And just like Ancient Egypt was conquered by the Greeks and Romans so are we still beholden to the Roman Empire to this day.

        In "the pyramid code" on Netflix there was a segment in which a local mystic (for lack of a more appropriate term) described how at one time everyone in that area was enlightened and lived in peace. Over time, some of the more influential in the spiritual community used the fear of death to manipulate people into giving them money/things to ensure their soul would be safe.
