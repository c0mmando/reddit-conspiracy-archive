<p>This happens more than you might think. When Bill Clinton was president, he ordered air strikes on a chemical weapons factory in Sudan the same day Monica Lewinsky testified against him. Bombing another country was a big deal at that time and the press had to cover it. They even nicknamed it Monica&#39;s War.</p>

<p>That chemical weapons factory he bombed turned out to be just an aspirin factory.. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Except it&#39;s both parties saying Russia interfered in the election... including the head of the FBI, one who it could be strongly argued did a TREMENDOUS amount for the Republican party during the election. The face of Russia interfering in the election is a bi-partisan notion that almost everyone in any position of authority (except for the person whose staff is under investigation) seems to agree on. </p>

<p>I could also, you know, quote what Trump himself said on the manner. </p>

<p>&quot;Reince Priebus said Trump believed Russia was behind the intrusions into the Democratic Party organizations, although Priebus did not clarify whether the president-elect agreed that the hacks were directed by Russian President Vladimir Putin. &quot;He accepts the fact that this particular case was entities in Russia, so that&#39;s not the issue,&quot; Priebus said on &quot;Fox News Sunday.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not saying i necesarily agree with the settiment that i&#39;m stating here, it&#39;s merely an observation. An idea, to start a conversation. without talking about these things, we can never progress, even if i am 100% wrong. And, i&#39;m reffering to the Seth Rich story. The past few days it seems that it was about to reach the public eye, then boom (pun intended), we are talking about a completely different event. </p>

<p>Also, if you look at the dates of the Dallas police shootings and the Florida shootings (gay night club), both happened after something happened with the clintons.  (i can&#39;t remember exactly what, but the dates are there if you research it) Maybe some of ya&#39;ll can help me out.</p>

<p>Again, i&#39;m well aware that this could be entirely random, and i accept that. but if we don&#39;t converse about these events, how can change come about. </p>

<p>just my 2 cents. </p>
