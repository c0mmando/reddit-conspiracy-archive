<p>thank you! it&#39;s a sub where the lizard shapeshifter theorists, the alien astronaut theorists, the FE theorists, the political theorists, the holocaust denying theorists,   the zionist theorists, the satanic panic theorists, and the gnostic theorists meet, just to name a few.

    <div class="md"><p>No, my point just went over your head. Nellie is an old favorite of conspiracy theorists and even though there&#39;s not much evidence to support the notion it&#39;s still a classic &quot;conspiracy theory&quot; and thus should be allowed to flourish here with open discussion. Just like Bigfoot, aliens, and the chupacabra. OP is clearly in the group of people that only want to discuss a small handful of topics that have &quot;scientific evidence&quot; (subjective) backing them and that&#39;s not what conspiracy <strong>theories</strong> are about.</p>

What exactly is it that you are &quot;discussing&quot; in regards to topics like Bigfoot, aliens, nessie, etc. if &quot;evidence&quot; isn&#39;t a concern? FWIW, all credible evidence could be considered &quot;scientific evidence&quot; if you really think about it. So if plausibility/proof of plausibility isn&#39;t an issue, what exactly are the discussions on these topics centered around? Or IS plausibility an issue, just not in the way I think?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re overthinking and overanalyzing this. There was just a post with archives of what r/conspiracy used to be like and it was way more chill, friendly, and goofy. Evidence is a concern, but some of you take it to the extreme and get hostile about a lack of evidence that you yourself would be satisfied with. This easily leads to censorship.</p>

<p>Quite frankly r/conspiracy has already become a shitty place to discuss conspiracies thanks to the politics and scientism crowd. It&#39;s like expecting your cat to use the toilet.

    <div class="md"><p>I couldn&#39;t care less about Seth Rich, the DNC or the geopolitical scene overall because it&#39;s all fake scripted bullshit for most of us, but I don&#39;t tell people not to post or share their ideas on things they aren&#39;t 100% certain of. These aren&#39;t phenomena either it&#39;s just an Internet forum that&#39;s supposed to be open to ALL conspiracy theories and no, not everyone is going to abide by your rules regarding how they write their posts. Yes, it&#39;s kind of like the crazy tabloids in the grocery store aisle, and yes you have to sift through what&#39;s BS and what&#39;s worth discussing, but that&#39;s what happens when we have free speech. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you&#39;re misunderstanding my point (and I used Seth Rich only as an example). </p>

<p>Speculation without evidence <em>is fine</em>. OP (and I) have an issue with people <strong>claiming factual confirmation</strong> when they have none. </p>

<p>To use your example of the Loch Ness monster: </p>

<p>A post entitled &quot;I believe the Loch Ness Monster is real&quot; is fine.</p>

<p>A post entitled &quot;<strong>CONFIRMED</strong>: LOCH NESS MONSTER IS REAL&quot; with to a screenshot from 4chan, with no facts or proof, <em>is</em> a problem.</p>

<p>Do you see the distinction? One is asserting a belief, the other is <strong>making a hard claim of factual proof</strong>, without any evidence to do so. </p>

<p><strong>No one is demanding that posters have proof of every claim</strong>. What we <em>are</em> saying is that if you&#39;re going to claim something is &quot;confirmed,&quot; have factual evidence backing it up. The difference is clear.</p>

<p>I also don&#39;t think <a href="/u/ThankTheCreator">/u/ThankTheCreator</a> is calling for censorship, and neither am I. I think his point (and mine) is simply that users should hold a higher standard of what constitutes &quot;proof&quot; before <strong><em>actively claiming</em></strong> that something is a confirmed fact.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>I can, and I do. I&#39;m sure OP does, too. But I can still do that, while simultaneously criticizing how some people behave on the forum. Constructive criticism can lead to improvement, and it <em>doesn&#39;t</em> mean I want to censor the behavior I disagree with.</p>

<p>But, to be clear: <strong>this isn&#39;t about weak theories vs. legitimate theories</strong>. This is about <em>any</em> type of theory (weak or legitimate) vs. downright false claims.</p>

<p>Using Seth Rich as an example: within the past week, I cannot tell you how many posts I have seen that have used terms like &quot;CONFIRMED&quot; or &quot;PROOF&quot; (often in caps) when the link being provided <em>contains none</em>. Yes, that sort of behavior drags down the intellectual center of this forum. </p>

<p>If people were simply posting Seth Rich theories or Seth Rich information,  that&#39;s fine. Even if the theory and/or information is questionable (or downright shitty), please: go right ahead.</p>

<p>What&#39;s not fine is making bombastic claims (&quot;CONFIRMED!&quot;) with no proof, and then having the community freak out (and upvote) these baseless assertions. I&#39;m free to criticize that.</p>

<p>Believe whatever it is you want to believe. People don&#39;t need to have evidence here, or &quot;prove&quot; anything. But I think it&#39;s fair to criticize people who say that their theories have been &quot;confirmed&quot;, but then link anonymous 4chan posters and self-promoting bloggers, neither of whom provide <em>any</em> factual proof to confirm the claim in question. </p>

<p>Well, at least you kind of understand. Yes, you do have that right. As all the people here have the right to make bad posts that you have to further investigate yourself.</p>

<p>Free speech wins, not your desire for regulated posting format. Sorry. You can keep repeating yourself about what you meant but I understood the first time. You don&#39;t like when people post things with words like &quot;confirmed&quot; when they&#39;re theories that you don&#39;t think have merit or don&#39;t have enough evidence to be factual. I think I&#39;ve made my point here as well, so we can agree to disagree.</p>

<p>I stated very clearly, numerous times, that I am not advocating censorship. Criticizing bad practices doesn&#39;t mean I wish to censor them. </p>

<p>Everyone here has the right to make shitty posts, and I will not infringe on their right to do so. I also have the right to criticize them, in the hopes that perhaps constructive criticism will improve the forum. This isn&#39;t difficult to understand.</p>

<p>It sure is for you...I keep thinking we&#39;re on the same page that each poster has a right to post what they want (within the rules), and each reader has a right to criticize, and you keep responding with little quips like I missed your point. I didn&#39;t. Goodbye.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You keep putting words in my mouth that inaccurately represent what I&#39;m saying. First, you suggested that I want everyone to provide factual evidence for every claim they make; then, you suggested I was criticizing &quot;weak&quot; theories; then, you suggested I wish to <em>downright censor</em> weak theories. None are accurate.</p>

<p>You also started with the snarky quips, beginning with your broadside of &quot;you&#39;ll have to figure out how to discern a weak theory from a legitimate theory on your own.&quot; When </p>

<p>1.) I hadn&#39;t been snarky at all before then.</p>

<p>2.) I never, ever discussed discerning weak &quot;theories&quot; from legitimate ones; I was discussing people making false claims of outright factual confirmation.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure I&#39;ve ever had my words be more poorly understood or badly represented. This isn&#39;t hard. Learn to fucking read, dude.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You keep saying &quot;this isn&#39;t hard&quot;, &quot;it&#39;s not difficult to understand&quot;, but you&#39;re the one upset and still writing comments like we&#39;re arguing about something. We&#39;re not. This ended several comments ago. </p>

<p>You weren&#39;t trying to censor, I get that. You were/are upset about how people phrase their post titles and comments, when there isn&#39;t sufficient evidence to support their claim, I get that too and stated as much. My rebuttal was that these things are necessary byproducts of a free-speech environment. So what are you so worked up about when I tried to say &quot;agree to disagree&quot; a while ago?</p>

<p>This isn&#39;t snarky. It&#39;s what we all have to do here. Both online and in real life. Wouldn&#39;t you agree? I was never intending to be snarky with that comment. It&#39;s really difficult dealing with people that always feel like they have to &quot;win&quot; an argument when there&#39;s nothing to be won. I&#39;m done here. You can be angry by yourself.</p>
