       thank you! it's a sub where the lizard shapeshifter theorists, the alien astronaut theorists, the FE theorists, the political theorists, the holocaust denying theorists,   the zionist theorists, the satanic panic theorists, and the gnostic theorists meet, just to name a few. We have so little in common I'm surprised there's as much live and let live as there is, which isn't much at all.

       People are eager for their pet narratives and personal beliefs to be proven true. Anything that confirms a pre-existing worldview, regardless of the source's credibility, is upvoted as gospel truth. Anything that doesn't conform to what they belief is discounted as propaganda or "shilling," no matter how rigorous the sourcing, and regardless of documentary proof.

       Because each person here has their own perception on what is 'fake' or not. Its an insane divide where either side has their own worldview of what is 'good' news and what is 'fake' news.
      </p>
      <p>
       When an event occurs, one side thinks its a false flag or a hoax. The other side thinks is a real tragedy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its a huge gap between both of these mindsets and it grows apart further each day.

      <p>
       You say something is false information and debunked quickly without evidence. Its all about your worldview. To the people posting, its real and the evidence is valid. To others, the evidence is absolutely not valid.

       You have said nothing of substance. You might as well have said "I propose that sub be crackalackin'" and then it would be up to me to provide the burden of proof that it not, in fact, be crackalackin'. And even if I did prove it, you could just be like "actually, that's not what it means to be crackalackin'" and then no matter what I say it'll always come out that you're right and I'm wrong. I'm not playing.

       No, my point just went over your head. Nellie is an old favorite of conspiracy theorists and even though there's not much evidence to support the notion it's still a classic "conspiracy theory" and thus should be allowed to flourish here with open discussion. Just like Bigfoot, aliens, and the chupacabra. OP is clearly in the group of people that only want to discuss a small handful of topics that have "scientific evidence" (subjective) backing them and that's not what conspiracy
       <strong>
        theories
       </strong>
       are about.
      </p>
      <p>
       TL;DR chill the fuck out and let people discuss conspiracy theories openly.

       I don't understand, but I want to. 
What exactly is it that you are "discussing" in regards to topics like Bigfoot, aliens, nessie, etc. if "evidence" isn't a concern? FWIW, all credible evidence could be considered "scientific evidence" if you really think about it. So if plausibility/proof of plausibility isn't an issue, what exactly are the discussions on these topics centered around? Or IS plausibility an issue, just not in the way I think?

       You're overthinking and overanalyzing this. There was just a post with archives of what r/conspiracy used to be like and it was way more chill, friendly, and goofy. Evidence is a concern, but some of you take it to the extreme and get hostile about a lack of evidence that you yourself would be satisfied with. This easily leads to censorship.
      </p>
      <p>
       Quite frankly r/conspiracy has already become a shitty place to discuss conspiracies thanks to the politics and scientism crowd. It's like expecting your cat to use the toilet. Stop holding the community to such ridiculous standards that don't exist and aren't even in the rules, and certainly aren't conducive to open discussion.

       I couldn't care less about Seth Rich, the DNC or the geopolitical scene overall because it's all fake scripted bullshit for most of us, but I don't tell people not to post or share their ideas on things they aren't 100% certain of. These aren't phenomena either it's just an Internet forum that's supposed to be open to ALL conspiracy theories and no, not everyone is going to abide by your rules regarding how they write their posts. Yes, it's kind of like the crazy tabloids in the grocery store aisle, and yes you have to sift through what's BS and what's worth discussing, but that's what happens when we have free speech.

       Anything else is censorship. There aren't rules about backing posts up with ample "evidence" so again, I don't understand what OP is in a huff about. Read the title of the sub, accept the format and rules, or move on.

       I think you're misunderstanding my point (and I used Seth Rich only as an example).
      </p>
      <p>
       Speculation without evidence
       <em>
        is fine
       </em>
       . OP (and I) have an issue with people
       <strong>
        claiming factual confirmation
       </strong>
       when they have none.
      </p>
      <p>
       To use your example of the Loch Ness monster:
      </p>
      <p>
       A post entitled "I believe the Loch Ness Monster is real" is fine.
      </p>
      <p>
       A post entitled "
       <strong>
        CONFIRMED
       </strong>
       : LOCH NESS MONSTER IS REAL" with to a screenshot from 4chan, with no facts or proof,
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       a problem.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you see the distinction? One is asserting a belief, the other is
       <strong>
        making a hard claim of factual proof
       </strong>
       , without any evidence to do so.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        No one is demanding that posters have proof of every claim
       </strong>
       . What we
       <em>
        are
       </em>
       saying is that if you're going to claim something is "confirmed," have factual evidence backing it up. The difference is clear.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also don't think
       <a href="/u/ThankTheCreator">
        /u/ThankTheCreator
       </a>
       is calling for censorship, and neither am I. I think his point (and mine) is simply that users should hold a higher standard of what constitutes "proof" before
       <strong>
        <em>
         actively claiming
        </em>
       </strong>
       that something is a confirmed fact.

       I'm going to refer back to my tabloid example here and just say that you'll have to figure out how to discern a weak theory from a legitimate theory on your own. You're obviously right that users should hold a higher standard, but this is the Internet.

       I can, and I do. I'm sure OP does, too. But I can still do that, while simultaneously criticizing how some people behave on the forum. Constructive criticism can lead to improvement, and it
       <em>
        doesn't
       </em>
       mean I want to censor the behavior I disagree with.
      </p>
      <p>
       But, to be clear:
       <strong>
        this isn't about weak theories vs. legitimate theories
       </strong>
       . This is about
       <em>
        any
       </em>
       type of theory (weak or legitimate) vs. downright false claims.
      </p>
      <p>
       Using Seth Rich as an example: within the past week, I cannot tell you how many posts I have seen that have used terms like "CONFIRMED" or "PROOF" (often in caps) when the link being provided
       <em>
        contains none
       </em>
       . Yes, that sort of behavior drags down the intellectual center of this forum.
      </p>
      <p>
       If people were simply posting Seth Rich theories or Seth Rich information,  that's fine. Even if the theory and/or information is questionable (or downright shitty), please: go right ahead.
      </p>
      <p>
       What's not fine is making bombastic claims ("CONFIRMED!") with no proof, and then having the community freak out (and upvote) these baseless assertions. I'm free to criticize that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Believe whatever it is you want to believe. People don't need to have evidence here, or "prove" anything. But I think it's fair to criticize people who say that their theories have been "confirmed", but then link anonymous 4chan posters and self-promoting bloggers, neither of whom provide
       <em>
        any
       </em>
       factual proof to confirm the claim in question.

       Free speech wins, not your desire for regulated posting format. Sorry. You can keep repeating yourself about what you meant but I understood the first time. You don't like when people post things with words like "confirmed" when they're theories that you don't think have merit or don't have enough evidence to be factual. I think I've made my point here as well, so we can agree to disagree.

       You ever been to r/science, because you severely misread or misunderstood my post.

       Scientism is the modern day crusades.
