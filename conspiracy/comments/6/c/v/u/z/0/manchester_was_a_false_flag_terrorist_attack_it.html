         A False Flag attack is an attack that is perpetrated by a government against itself in order to harbor public support for attacking an external enemy. It is entirely different from a hoax accusation, which is the stupid kind of conspiracy where you think something that happened in front of hundreds or thousands of people, something that has tons of video evidence, somehow didn't happen.

         Even if you aren't conspiratorially minded and don't believe that western governments control most terrorist attacks,
         <strong>
          even from the MSM narrative this terror attack is still the fault of the west. Groups like ISIS were created, armed, and funded by the west, and their expansion is created by us. If they "inspire" someone to carry out an attack like this, it's only because of how large the west has inflated ISIS with weapons and even PR.

       Man that's how definitions get destroyed. If you think children died there, say it was a false flag or a real shooting. If you think children didn't die call it a hoax. Please don't make these definitions fudge into the same word because the distinction is EXTREMELY important.

       To me it was a hoax that was used as a false flag.
      </p>
      <p>
       Meaning someone got to check some stuff off on their agenda by scaring the masses. While simultaneously not killing anyone, leaving their conscious clear and potential liability incase they're caught.

       You're right though, normally the two definitions should stay apart and distinct. But for SH, it was a rarity for it to be both.

       Pretty much any hoax is a false flag. Someone is faking an attack and blaming it on someone else.

       I can't think of a hoax where the people tried to blame it on themselves. They blame it on others.

       I think the external enemy is Kim Dotcom at the moment. It's honestly just bizarre that I've watched footage of crisis actors in this same situation. My theory is that maybe no one died. I think this had two purposes: 1. To cover up Kim Dotcom news 2. To somehow feed on the fear that was generated at the event. I think it was partly a ritual if that makes sense. Idk maybe I'm losing it.

       Anyway fuck me if this wasn't a false flag. RIP to any innocent lives lost.

       That's insane though. Most people aren't paying attention to Seth Rich already, I know it feels like everyone's exploding with this story in our echo chamber here, but the rest of the world really doesn't give a fuck until people find that smoking gun. Most people hate and distrust Hannity so just the fact that the theory is on his show discredits it, which is probably why the MSM let him cover Seth Rich in the first place.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyways, something like this has way more implications and motives to have anything to do with Seth Rich. Attacks like these match the MO of Operation Gladio B, which I invite you to do research on, as well as the original Operation Gladio which was a declassified NATO operation in which NATO funded neo-nazi and leftist terrorists in European nations to commit acts of terror in order to make those countries fall in line with NATO's expansion against the Warsaw pact. The same thing is happening now except using ISIS extremists.

       Do some research, look up FBI whistleblower Sibel Edmonds, who the ACLU once called the most gagged women in America because the government has used more laws to keep her from talking about the secrets she knows than any other citizen in history (according to the ACLU at least). Her story is insane, but her insights on Gladio B (which isn't the official name of the operation, it is just what people inside the FBI called it) are even more alarming.

       Yes Corbett does excellent coverage on it. There's also an old
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGHXjO8wHsA">
        BBC Timewatch documentary
       </a>
       and a
       <a href="https://youtu.be/k83L3I6Z35w">
        50 minute Australian news special

       about the original Gladio that I highly suggest to people. Probably worth watching before you jump into Corbett's reporting so you have more contextual understanding as they cover Gladio B.

        even from the MSM narrative this terror attack is still the fault of the west. Groups like ISIS were created, armed, and funded by the west, and their expansion is created by us. If they "inspire" someone to carry out an attack like this, it's only because of how large the west has inflated ISIS with weapons and even PR.

       In fairness, they do check all bags or pat down people in heavy coats etc. I've been to the arena many times. The explosion happened in the very large foyer, before the exit/entrance to the arena. Anyone can walk into there. It connects to the street and to Victoria train station.

       I'm not sure what part you're being sarcastic about but the timing here is raising new concerns about public safety (achieving the terrorists goal of causing terror).
      </p>
      <p>
       People arrive at an event over the course of a couple of hours. During the event, you have the security of the facility protecting you. After an event, everyone leaves at once and you have a mass of people outside security at once.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look for calls for increased public surveillance and other measures to "protect" public areas like streets and parks that aren't controlled access already like arenas and airports.

       I'm literally floored by the coverage. It was a bunch of young adults at that show. Not one person took a video or photo of the aftermath? A lot of injured people photos but nobody who looks like they were injured from an explosion. Injuries consistent with falls and stampedes.

       What I really like of ISIS is the fact that they can attack everywhere, are everywhere, yet, they haven't done nothing in or against israel.
      </p>
      <p>
       And conveniently, their "attacks" seems to happen when one of the west leaders are in hot water for their corruption.

       Has there been a single image released to suggest a bomb went off? I haven't seen anything yet. Not so much as a shard of broken glass. I've seen people who appear to have been injured in a stampede and a bunch of people panicking after a loud noise. I hate being 'that guy' but I need proof that there really was a bomb before I can take the next step and believe it was a false flag.

       lolwut, you really think Obama was every in control? Oh wait you still think Presidents are like Kings or some shit? They're tools genius, they're servants to the elite, the superclass, the deep state, and the military industrial complex. Blaming Obama for everything is about as stupid as blaming Trump for everything. These men are just scapegoats for the other side to blame while the real criminals laugh at the sheep slaughtering each other. Come on, don't fall for that shit.

       But then why is it that Obama and Trump have such different views and also operated in different ways? Did "The Man" have a plan under Obama and realized it didn't work and then changed it with Trump? Are they both tools of not the same but 2 different elites?

       And what evidence do you have for that insane claim? By making skeptics look like morons you're actually the one serving the interests of Skull and Bones you idiot. They murder people and you are stupid enough to go "noone died" at best your an idiot at worst you're complicit with their disinformation campaigns that they and the CIA use to discredit so called "conspiracy theorists" as they call us.

       God I had to scroll down too far to see this. I didn't think it would even be on the sub. It's a pretty standard tactic to frame skeptics as believing the event was a hoax, to make it seem like anyone who doesn't accept the official account must be a traitor.

       That's insane though. Most people aren't paying attention to Seth Rich already, I know it feels like everyone's exploding with this story in our echo chamber here, but the rest of the world really doesn't give a fuck until people find that smoking gun. Most people hate and distrust Hannity so just the fact that the theory is on his show discredits it, which is probably why the MSM let him cover Seth Rich in the first place.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyways, something like this has way more implications and motives to have anything to do with Seth Rich. Attacks like these match the MO of Operation Gladio B, which I invite you to do research on, as well as the original Operation Gladio which was a declassified NATO operation in which NATO funded neo-nazi and leftist terrorists in European nations to commit acts of terror in order to make those countries fall in line with NATO's expansion against the Warsaw pact. The same thing is happening now except using ISIS extremists.
