    <div class="md"><p>To me it was a hoax that was used as a false flag.</p>

<p>Meaning someone got to check some stuff off on their agenda by scaring the masses. While simultaneously not killing anyone, leaving their conscious clear and potential liability incase they&#39;re caught.</p>

<p>You&#39;re right though, normally the two definitions should stay apart and distinct. But for SH, it was a rarity for it to be both.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>I think the external enemy is Kim Dotcom at the moment. It&#39;s honestly just bizarre that I&#39;ve watched footage of crisis actors in this same situation. My theory is that maybe no one died. I think this had two purposes: 1. To cover up Kim Dotcom news 2. To somehow feed on the fear that was generated at the event. I think it was partly a ritual if that makes sense. Idk maybe I&#39;m losing it.</p>

<p>Anyway fuck me if this wasn&#39;t a false flag. RIP to any innocent lives lost.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s insane though. Most people aren&#39;t paying attention to Seth Rich already, I know it feels like everyone&#39;s exploding with this story in our echo chamber here, but the rest of the world really doesn&#39;t give a fuck until people find that smoking gun. Most people hate and distrust Hannity so just the fact that the theory is on his show discredits it, which is probably why the MSM let him cover Seth Rich in the first place. </p>

<p>Anyways, something like this has way more implications and motives to have anything to do with Seth Rich. Attacks like these match the MO of Operation Gladio B, which I invite you to do research on, as well as the original Operation Gladio which was a declassified NATO operation in which NATO funded neo-nazi and leftist terrorists in European nations to commit acts of terror in order to make those countries fall in line with NATO&#39;s expansion against the Warsaw pact. The same thing is happening now except using ISIS extremists. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do some research, look up FBI whistleblower Sibel Edmonds, who the ACLU once called the most gagged women in America because the government has used more laws to keep her from talking about the secrets she knows than any other citizen in history (according to the ACLU at least). Her story is insane, but her insights on Gladio B (which isn&#39;t the official name of the operation, it is just what people inside the FBI called it) are even more alarming. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes Corbett does excellent coverage on it. There&#39;s also an old <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGHXjO8wHsA">BBC Timewatch documentary</a> and a <a href="https://youtu.be/k83L3I6Z35w">50 minute Australian news special</a> about the original Gladio that I highly suggest to people.

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not sure what part you&#39;re being sarcastic about but the timing here is raising new concerns about public safety (achieving the terrorists goal of causing terror).</p>

<p>People arrive at an event over the course of a couple of hours. During the event, you have the security of the facility protecting you. After an event, everyone leaves at once and you have a mass of people outside security at once.</p>

<p>Look for calls for increased public surveillance and other measures to &quot;protect&quot; public areas like streets and parks that aren&#39;t controlled access already like arenas and airports.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s insane though. Most people aren&#39;t paying attention to Seth Rich already, I know it feels like everyone&#39;s exploding with this story in our echo chamber here, but the rest of the world really doesn&#39;t give a fuck until people find that smoking gun. Most people hate and distrust Hannity so just the fact that the theory is on his show discredits it, which is probably why the MSM let him cover Seth Rich in the first place. </p>

<p>Anyways, something like this has way more implications and motives to have anything to do with Seth Rich. Attacks like these match the MO of Operation Gladio B, which I invite you to do research on, as well as the original Operation Gladio which was a declassified NATO operation in which NATO funded neo-nazi and leftist terrorists in European nations to commit acts of terror in order to make those countries fall in line with NATO&#39;s expansion against the Warsaw pact. The same thing is happening now except using ISIS extremists. </p>
