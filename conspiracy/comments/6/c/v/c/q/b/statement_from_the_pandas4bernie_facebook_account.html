        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">14</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2017-05-23 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/LeftousCrusader.html">LeftousCrusader</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;d link the account directly, but that triggers the auto-censor. You can find the link in r/WikiLeaks though.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hi. We are Pandas4Bernie. And we’ve come back to say a few things about the speculation raging on the internet about our social media account and the late Seth Rich.</p>

<p>First, let&#39;s state the obvious: this account did not belong to Seth Rich. We created Pandas4Bernie as a collective project, to build a library of educational memes we hoped would be fun and useful for grassroots progressives. We never heard the name Seth Rich until news broke of his untimely death in the aftermath of the DNC email leaks. That terrible week at the DNC was the final straw for many of us; so we made the decision to retire Pandas4Bernie and made our #Demexit, most of us moving on to the Greens.</p>

<p>Imagine our surprise when nearly one year later, we learn that our dormant little panda lair had been re-discovered and cast as a major piece of a viral conspiracy meme; In the same weekend, the trauma of last year’s DNC repeats itself as an unrepentant, corrupt party elite reassert their dominance at the CA state convention. Progressives walked out of the convention hall yesterday feeling abused and betrayed after a pharmaceutical lobbyist was ‘elected’ as party chair amidst a firestorm of protests and allegations of election fraud - like Keith Ellison before her, and Bernie before that.</p>

<p>Perhaps the bizarre coincidences that pulled our little group into the spotlight, at this time and in this way, says something about what you wanted to see; but maybe also what we all need to hear as our movement stands at the crossroads. In this brief opening that meme magic happened to bestow upon us, we have an opportunity and responsibility to speak honestly to you, our fellow Berners and seekers of hope.</p>

<p>We know some of you are reading this with disappointment; you’d hoped this was the smoking gun that proves Seth Rich’s whistleblower identity once and for all. We can’t pretend that Pandas4Bernie is something it’s not. What we do know is that the DNC emails are still real; they outline the nature of our current impasse; they expose real problems which still go unresolved. The DNC’s intractable refusal to reckon with these problems has only deepened the void between social needs and political representation - that gave us Trump, the opioid epidemic, and other “diseases of despair.” Smoking guns solve historical puzzles, but it cannot close the gap; only politics can do that.</p>

<p>Of all the attention Pandas4Bernie has received in the last few days, we hear a good bit of talk about the inspiration people have drawn from what they thought to be Seth’s words, in our ‘Manifesto for a Movement,’ written at a moment of uncertainty to remind us of the importance of resolve. We may not be Seth Rich, but we can do justice to his life by extending the effects of his work, by honoring the courage of whistleblowers who put their lives on the line to expose the truths that animate our demands for justice, and ultimately to break the power of corrupt, undemocratic elites once and for all over our lives and institutions.</p>

<p>Faced with an insurgent progressive wing whose spontaneous energy cannot guarantee their ability to contain it, party elites resort to ever greater mechanisms of coercive control, dispensing with even the slightest concession to its political base. Why? Because they fear our power, palpable in the energy we bring that transforms their spaces. What those who control us fear most is the moment when we realize <em>we don&#39;t actually need them.</em></p>

<p>When our leaders betrayed us at the DNC, Berners were united with each other as we walked out of that convention hall. Even today, as many different forces threaten to divide us, we must keep faith in the courage of our convictions, and our eyes on the prize of a just, equitable, and livable future we fight for because we must.</p>

<p>We created Pandas4Bernie as a collective identity, so that the pandas could represent any one of us at any given time. And so it goes. You thought the pandas were Seth Rich for a time - and for that time it meant something to you. What you see in the pandas - and in all our heroes, the flawed human beings and politicians that inevitably disappoint our expectations - is a reflection of your own revolutionary dreams. The pandas aren’t Seth Rich anymore, but maybe now the pandas are free once again to be us all. Pandas, like true revolutionaries, are an endangered species. But sometimes, in the darkest of times, a new hope comes along...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So I believe them because they&#39;re describing my reaction to what I learned from the 2016 election. You know, it resonates with me. </p>

<p>As the guy who got banned from r/politics for repeatedly posting &quot;Bernie is a Judas goat for TPP&quot; every time it got down voted below visibility (and oh the downvote counts were epic), I can assure you that DNC does not want this message to be seen by anyone. They do not want ANY of their voters EVER reading ANYTHING from WikiLeaks, and they will brigade my ass on sight. I think I have a frigging fan club inside their troll organization, and I&#39;m pretty sure I&#39;ve done rhetorical combat with their very best shills.</p>

<p>Anywho, the message is not going to be promoted by establishment Democrats no way no how.</p>
