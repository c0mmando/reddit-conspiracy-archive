    <div class="md"><p>Any post is subject to brigades with the right bots etc.  I&#39;ve gone into those SR posts and haven&#39;t seen anything really compelling as of yet.  We all want the murderers found and brought to justice, it&#39;s just the politicization of it is kind of ridiculous.  I asked before, what more should the police be doing?  They have a 25k reward.  They have 2 detectives assigned to it.  The guy was killed at 4 AM, not on camera and with no witnesses.  I&#39;m not sure how far they can go into getting to the bottom of it given that.  They did check his laptop and say there was nothing about Wikileaks on there, but if you think about it logically, he was leaving a bar at 4 in the morning in a city that is # 13 on the list of homicide frequency.  It&#39;s not outside the realm of possibility that it was indeed an attempted robbery.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What&#39;s weird is the police officer responding to the scene personally knowing the most likely person to arrange said murder (John Podesta). He was his professor a few years ago. There is at least a link there, because how likely it is that all the cops that have investigated crimes caused by the leaks were friends with either Podesta or James Alefantis previously. It&#39;s weird that they know each other in both of these topics.</p>

<p>Also, Podesta often said in his emails stuff like &quot;I think it&#39;s time for (person) to take a permanent vacation at an undisclosed japanese island&quot;, &quot;I want to make an example of this leaker, to show we will not tolerate this&quot; (paraphrasing).</p>

There has to be a better way to discuss this and investigate/research that&#39;s more efficient than bundles of individual posts, I just don&#39;t know what that is.

<p>It&#39;s a shame there&#39;s literally been no evidence to date that the DNCLeaks or Podesta Emails came from Russia. What there <em>has</em> been, however, has been evidence gleaned from Guccifer 2.0/DCLeaks- who are totally unaffiliated with Wikileaks. Which the media has endlessly conflated with the DNCLeaks, almost as if that were some sort of intended effect... to have witless rubes such as yourself believe that &quot;Russian election interference&quot; had, in fact, already been in some way proven...</p>
