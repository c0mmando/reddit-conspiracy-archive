       When the Deep State and MSM work together in collusion, it becomes plainly obvious that powerful forces are at play behind the scenes. The last thing they want you to know it's the truth of what happened.

       Keep digging, keep pushing until it's solved.

       You have the right to post about it but posting 10-20 stories on the main page is a little excessive, no?  I mean, you could talk about it in any given thread.  It's pushing down other conspiracies so in a way the Seth Rich story is censoring r/conspiracy with its frequency of posts.

       That actually sounds like a good solution.  I wonder if they could make 2 megathreads to be balanced - 1 for Trump/Russia &amp; 1 for Seth Rich.  Then people would have a place to go to discuss.

       Megathreads are awful for actual discussion and terribly susceptible to brigades. Scolling past topics you aren't interested in reading is a fairly easy solution unless you're a person that is feeling worn out by needing to patrol every SR post.

       Any post is subject to brigades with the right bots etc.  I've gone into those SR posts and haven't seen anything really compelling as of yet.  We all want the murderers found and brought to justice, it's just the politicization of it is kind of ridiculous.  I asked before, what more should the police be doing?  They have a 25k reward.  They have 2 detectives assigned to it.  The guy was killed at 4 AM, not on camera and with no witnesses.  I'm not sure how far they can go into getting to the bottom of it given that.  They did check his laptop and say there was nothing about Wikileaks on there, but if you think about it logically, he was leaving a bar at 4 in the morning in a city that is # 13 on the list of homicide frequency.  It's not outside the realm of possibility that it was indeed an attempted robbery.

       None of that explains why conversation on this or Trump/Russia should be consolidated. Different threads have different nuances. Don't read them if they bother you.

       What's weird is the police officer responding to the scene personally knowing the most likely person to arrange said murder (John Podesta). He was his professor a few years ago. There is at least a link there, because how likely it is that all the cops that have investigated crimes caused by the leaks were friends with either Podesta or James Alefantis previously. It's weird that they know each other in both of these topics.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, Podesta often said in his emails stuff like "I think it's time for (person) to take a permanent vacation at an undisclosed japanese island", "I want to make an example of this leaker, to show we will not tolerate this" (paraphrasing).

       I second that. There has to be a better way to discuss this and investigate/research that's more efficient than bundles of individual posts, I just don't know what that is. I realize for some things a mega thread has its problems, but possibly the community can come up with something else or tweak the current format.

       Maybe it's just because you don't like the narrative so you feel more inclined to complain about it? It's going against how you personally feel about the Russia story, and this story about Seth if proven true would destroy that Russian narrative?

       This goes both ways. The only reason you guys give a single fuck about this kid is because you want so bad for the Russian connection to wiki leaks to not be true. You don't give a shot about him or his family or anything else. You're just desperate to somehow prove that he was the source and not Russia.

       Kim Dotcom fulfilled his only promise- delivering a statement qualifying the kind of evidence he has, and what he intends to do with it. He never said he'd be providing any kind of evidence or proof today.

       It's a shame there's literally been no evidence to date that the DNCLeaks or Podesta Emails came from Russia. What there
       <em>
        has
       </em>
       been, however, has been evidence gleaned from Guccifer 2.0/DCLeaks- who are totally unaffiliated with Wikileaks. Which the media has endlessly conflated with the DNCLeaks, almost as if that were some sort of intended effect... to have witless rubes such as yourself believe that "Russian election interference" had, in fact, already been in some way proven...

       Is Seth Rich now the property of his family or something? Adult Man, trademarked Mom and Dad and Brother Rich. Also, his uncle thinks he was murdered by the DNC and does want help from people.
      </p>
      <p>
       He's a murdered independent adult not being actively investigated.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, his family just announced they DO want help in finding if the DNC really killed him after being convinced by the internet and have a 12 thousand dollar reward too.

       While you have the right to ask questions, they have the right to not release information on an open murder investigation. They can keep it open for another 10 years and tell you nothing at all. Be happy they threw you a bone.
