       Republicans have been investigating Hillary Clinton since 1995. They have had House and Senate power to do so most of the time since then:
      </p>
      <p>
       1995-2001, 2003-2007, 2011-present.
      </p>
      <p>
       And yet NO CHARGES, NO ARRESTS. Donald Trump has not made good on his promise to "Lock her up" either.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why not? Because HRC investigations are political tools by the Republican Party to discourage voters and to gain or hold power. Pretty simple.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not that HRC is clean and free of wrongdoing .... definitely not!
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        HRC's real wrongdoing is essentially the same as Republican wrongdoing.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Therefore, the Establishment won't touch it.

       If you really can't realize that it's because she's one of the richest and most influential politicians of all time right? Just like the rest of them. They live above the law. Please don't act like she's not a criminal. If you don't think so, then you haven't done much research.

       I can admit my bias and I sometimes get caught up in the distraction of the day and forget my own beliefs on politicians.
      </p>
      <p>
       As many have noted in this thread, the political establishment is an insidious sea of corruption.  The FACT that Hillary and Bill have become so wealthy by way of "public service" is a travesty.  The most salient point I will make is that while the Clintons are notorious for this kind of behavior it is a behavior shared by both parties.  The most long standing members of both parties that make up our government are filthy dirty.  The partisan theater we call cable news is a distraction and so is most of the blogosphere.

       You touched on something important in all of that.

       There's two parties, the democrats and the republicans.

       Establishment is one of those words that hasn't been destroyed by newspeak yet.

       Unfortunately, too many voting users of r/conspiracy have become pure partisan. A submission like this that hits both parties is going to be slaughtered in down votes. That's too bad. :(

       The reason why crooked Hillary hasn't been jailed yet, is that she is "Family".
      </p>
      <p>
       She is family related with D.J. Trumps bloodline via her Rodham family bloodline.
      </p>
      <p>
       Both D.J. Trumps and H.R. Clintons families are connected to Edward III, King of England.
      </p>
      <p>
       All US. Presidents back to George Washington are family related to the english royalty.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is documented in "Burke's Peerage".
      </p>
      <p>
       I severely reccomend you watch "The Trump Card" by Dr. Walther Veith.
      </p>
      <p>
       The US. Presidents are elected at the Bohemian Grove in California btw.
      </p>
      <p>
       The public "elections" are just a distraction, the US. voters got bamboozled again.

       Clearances don't work like that. Once you hit TS/SCI (which is different than TS by a lifestyle and CI polygraph), you will always end up compartmentalized. "Need to know" is king. If you don't have a reason to you, you won't. This applies to the President also. Unless there is an alien invasion, he doesn't get to know about the aliens we have in captivity.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hell, they would probably wait to make sure the aliens were the same 'kind' before they told him about the ones they had. My point being that 435 Reps have nowhere near the same level of visibility on any given issue.

       Hillary is invincible and immune to human laws. She is a vampire who lives off of the blood of the children and therefore cannot be killed or captured by mere mortals.

       If she goes down, she'll bring a whole lot of people down with her. So much so it possibly could affect the whole system that masquerades as our government today. Those in power will not risk throwing her in the pokey.

       Interesting. I don't see her selling out the establishment no matter what. But I would like to see them try to "lock her up" because I agree that it will expose wrongdoing in both parties. :)

       Or, perhaps, it's partisan bullshit and if they beat the Clintons they don't care anymore. Kinda like how Chaffetz had months of Benghazi investigations lined up but suddenly, on November 10, it didn't matter anymore and they never mentioned it again.

       Ooo, very good point. But money buys power, and HRC still has a lot of that, as well as political pull. I think putting her under the gavel is more complicated than meets the eye. Partisan aside. It will cost a lot of money, and not all republicans were and are against hrc in the first place.
