        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Republicans have been investigating Hillary Clinton since 1995. They have had House and Senate power to do so most of the time since then:</p>

<p>1995-2001, 2003-2007, 2011-present.</p>

<p>And yet NO CHARGES, NO ARRESTS. Donald Trump has not made good on his promise to &quot;Lock her up&quot; either.</p>

<p>Why not? Because HRC investigations are political tools by the Republican Party to discourage voters and to gain or hold power. Pretty simple.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not that HRC is clean and free of wrongdoing .... definitely not!</p>

<p><strong>HRC&#39;s real wrongdoing is essentially the same as Republican wrongdoing.</strong></p>

<p>Therefore, the Establishment won&#39;t touch it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can admit my bias and I sometimes get caught up in the distraction of the day and forget my own beliefs on politicians.  </p>

<p>As many have noted in this thread, the political establishment is an insidious sea of corruption.  The FACT that Hillary and Bill have become so wealthy by way of &quot;public service&quot; is a travesty.  The most salient point I will make is that while the Clintons are notorious for this kind of behavior it is a behavior shared by both parties.  The most long standing members of both parties that make up our government are filthy dirty.  The partisan theater we call cable news is a distraction and so is most of the blogosphere.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The reason why crooked Hillary hasn&#39;t been jailed yet, is that she is &quot;Family&quot;.</p>

<p>She is family related with D.J. Trumps bloodline via her Rodham family bloodline.</p>

<p>Both D.J. Trumps and H.R. Clintons families are connected to Edward III, King of England.</p>

<p>All US. Presidents back to George Washington are family related to the english royalty.</p>

<p>This is documented in &quot;Burke&#39;s Peerage&quot;.</p>

<p>I severely reccomend you watch &quot;The Trump Card&quot; by Dr. Walther Veith.</p>

<p>The US. Presidents are elected at the Bohemian Grove in California btw. </p>

<p>The public &quot;elections&quot; are just a distraction, the US. voters got bamboozled again.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Clearances don&#39;t work like that. Once you hit TS/SCI (which is different than TS by a lifestyle and CI polygraph), you will always end up compartmentalized. &quot;Need to know&quot; is king. If you don&#39;t have a reason to you, you won&#39;t. This applies to the President also. Unless there is an alien invasion, he doesn&#39;t get to know about the aliens we have in captivity. </p>

<p>Hell, they would probably wait to make sure the aliens were the same &#39;kind&#39; before they told him about the ones they had. My point being that 435 Reps have nowhere near the same level of visibility on any given issue.</p>
