    <div class="md"><p>Access is not an issue with these clowns. Can move a .ost file to a shared drive in like 3 minutes and  user would never notice. Admins wouldn&#39;t notice until afterwards when trying to figure out what happened.</p>

<p>The core of the leak, DNC primary fraud is what he was upset about. </p>

<p>He was just about to start a job on Clinton campaign when he was murdered. If anyone can find out about that interview process I think there could be a key connection there. </p>

<p>I know if I needed to find a leak inside my organization I&#39;d flush it out through a positive job interview style inquisition.</p>

<p>PG taught me a lot of DC businesses are owned by low profile high influence political operatives. Would not surprise me to find this guy has some dirty money and other such fuckery around him and would be game to help the DNC with a hit from time to time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nice. I think the Bernie supporters are the real leaders of this investigation. The trumpies wanna use it to take away from Trump&#39;s problems, the clintonians wanna use Seth to say a foreign agent killed him, but the Sanders people wanna use Seth to point out the DNC rigged against Sanders. It&#39;s most likely the Sanders supporters are right. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If I remember correctly, he&#39;d uncovered that the DNC rigged the primary against Bernie so HRC was assured the nomination. Not sure where I read it but some have said he was on the way to meet w/ FBI to provide evidence of corruption and other dirt he had on DNC/HRC when he was killed to silence him. 
That also begs the question of how he was found out in the first place. If you believe he was the WL source,
Did he accidentally leave evidence of what he uncovered on a DNC computer?</p>

<p>Was he already suspected &amp; being surveilled when they possibly intercepted communication between him &amp; WL/confidante that confirmed he was the leak?</p>

<p>Or if you follow the WL being a limited/hangout theory, it&#39;s possible they are compromised and that someone @ WL sold him out. </p>

<p>Several of these theories make sense to me if indeed he was found out to be the leak and otw the meet w/ FBI. Almost as if it was done in a hurry to tie up a loose end, certainly explains the lack of any traffic cam footage, security camera footage. If it was a hit planned in advance, seems there are plenty of ways to do it that wouldn&#39;t require as much work to coverup and leave so many unanswered questions. 
Just from the list provided by another Reddit user thats familiar with D.C., there are far too many cameras he listed specifically at multiple different places that they all had a &quot;malfunction&quot; or didn&#39;t provide some insight into what really happened or evidence. Seems like damage control to me, wouldn&#39;t be that hard for people/organizations with almost unlimited resources, contacts, and lack of morals to have him assassinated then go around collecting camera footage, and/or wiping hard drives , possibly remotely if you think about all the tools the NSA &amp; CIA have in their toolbox. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>With all the shady stuff they&#39;ve done and are into, it wouldn&#39;t surprise me one bit. By law, the CIA aren&#39;t supposed to operate domestically without the oversight of another federal agency such as the FBI, DEA, etc. but that doesn&#39;t mean they don&#39;t anyway. 
Especially when politicians are friends with/chummy with intelligence big wigs. To me it seems very possible and likely that behind closed doors, a problem arises (SR), politician or higher up contacts a friend @ intelligence agencies or other entities that have trained human assets willing to do anything. (DNC/HRC) Word is relayed to the asset about what or who needs taking care of, then they control the &quot;official&quot; narrative you see on mainstream news networks and tv by their sources in the press (Operation Mockingbird) by making up a story of events that point to something else by evidence that is false, planted, orchestrated a la &quot;staged&quot; to appear one way, or sometimes no evidence at all. If history has shown us anything, it&#39;s that the general public will believe just about anything they see on tv or are told by the talking heads. Even though many may find official stories very unlikely or downright fishy, people in general do not care as long as the tv stays on, they keep playing their favorite reality shows, posting on fb, sending snapchats, buying the latest stuff they don&#39;t need but advertising and society are telling you need to have. 
Such is the sad phenomenon known as American Apathy. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So is it right to theorize the &quot;Russian Hacking&quot; narrative was created as a result of the SR/DNC coverup? That at least makes sense to me/seems like a reasonable theory. </p>

<p>OR, they already had the &quot;Russian Hacker&quot; story planned &amp; were waiting for a strategic time to release it, but SR moved up their timeline &amp; forced their hand. (Assuming he was the WL source &amp; was found out). And now, is kept going to distract from other things &amp; to attack Trump, such as the senators/ congressmen who keep calling for impeachment based on the grounds of &quot;Russia hacked/interfered in the election. Which is somewhat amusing if you remember late October/early November 2016 when HRC was projected to win in a landslide, the MSM were pushing the &quot;election can&#39;t be hacked&quot; narrative real hard in the weeks leading up to the election. 
On a side note, I also find it interesting that with the revelation of China executing many CIA assets in China effectively destroying their East Asian/Chinese  network. 
HRC&#39;s un-secured servers contained classified information, that people with no security/TS clearance were able to access &amp; setup. Is it possible there was info on these servers that were related to some of the CIA&#39;s assets in China? Or possibly her un-secured server was compromised, or worse. 
Worse as in intentionally &quot;burning&quot; the assets cover in exchange for money or favors if she won the election. 
Keep in mind the Awan brothers, while briefly covered in the media when the info initially came out, are not being charged with anything.  There also hasn&#39;t been any press coverage on them or remarks by politicians to investigate who/what they had access to and many other questions that need to be answered. From what I&#39;ve read, it seems they have a treasure trove of blackmail material from having so much access to various politicians computers while working IT. Their salaries were also pretty suspect, but I&#39;m leaning towards the idea that they have so much dirt on so many people, that&#39;s their insurance to not be investigated. 
Didn&#39;t mean to commandeer the post, I tend to get sidetracked but I really believe all of these things are related in one way or another. 
What does everyone else think?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think Russia did hack the us voter databases and both RNC DNC. Only an incompetent Intel group would not be trying to spy on others. I completely think that Seth Rich found evidence of voter fraud so the DNC found Russian attacks and had that as a way to say the Russians were setting them up. I also feel the Congress knows this, but if it came out that election fraud was real, it would challenge every member elected in office bc who knows if they cheated too. I think Trump won bc it was so obvious Clinton rigged it that they couldn&#39;t hide it. To preserve the duopoly, they had to step down. The DNC won&#39;t let any US government group investigate their servers or machines which is odd bc they are pushing the Russia narrative. And the Russia thing went from hacking the election to interfering in the election to Flynn being a Russian plant. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why would Russia want to hack DNC &amp; RNC? The whole Russian connection is used to attack Trump by saying he&#39;s in bed with them, they swung the election for him, and that he owes them favors. If they were colluding w/ Trump and his people then what would be the point to hacking the RNC? Maybe I&#39;m missing something here but that&#39;s why I asked. 
The DNC not letting the government investigate their servers, etc. is a big red flag. Does it make any sense that the side crying Russian hacking in the election and collusion with Trump is the same entity that won&#39;t let the government investigate? 
If nothing else, you&#39;d think they&#39;d be happy to have the resources of the US government to help investigate if they truly think Russia hacked into their servers but they don&#39;t. They&#39;ve changed the story on Flynn many times, but him being on Turkeys payroll is worse IMO. The whole circumstances of him being fired/resigning is strange. He also is very well liked by President Trump and they&#39;re both extremely loyal to eachother. Such as Trump telling Comey to &quot;take it easy on Flynn, he&#39;s a good guy&quot;. Is he really that loyal to him or does Flynn know too much/ have blackmail material. 
I think there have been some big deals made behind closed doors such as agreeing to not investigate or pursue charges against Obama, HRC, etc. for what they got in exchange for that I have no idea. 
Also the timing of Comey re-opening the email investigation right before the election just to close it again citing insufficient evidence as he had before is strange. And now, being fired and asked to testify openly, the memos, &amp; Trumps tweet to Comey saying: &quot;he better hope there aren&#39;t tapes of our conversations (or anyone getting ahold of the tapes). 
There&#39;s quite a lot going on right now, while I believe it&#39;s all interconnected, sadly I don&#39;t believe anything real or groundbreaking will come of it. 
Having said that, a lot of things have happened recently people never would&#39;ve thought possible, so who knows?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Of course, I&#39;m not that naive that I think the US isn&#39;t involved in the same shady stuff other countries do but we don&#39;t have sanctions imposed or are really demonized that much for it compared to other countries. Possibly because we are THE superpower. 
I think most Americans and patriots believe we&#39;re always the good guys and always try to do the right thing. By being sort of the &quot;police&quot; of the world, or in other words poking our nose into other things &amp; countries that are really none of our business. 
As far as good vs bad, I think most informed people would agree there is no black &amp; white answer to that. Our country&#39;s history is stained with many regrettable and morally questionable events. I can admit my country isn&#39;t perfect, and that there are a lot of things that need fixing first, such as taking care of our veterans who we rely on to keep us safe. 
Having said that, with all the problems we currently have and things we should/shouldn&#39;t be doing, I wouldn&#39;t want to live anywhere else in the world than the US. There&#39;s a reason people risk their lives and limbs to get here. Not just to escape oppressive governments in their homeland, we enjoy more personal freedoms than any other countries population do, and if you&#39;re a patriot, you probably also feel it&#39;s the greatest country in the world. 
Now if something could be done about how rigged our entire political system is and return power to the people like the founding fathers wanted, that would fix a lot of problems and make our country even greater. With all the resources and wealth that major first world nations have alone, not to mention combined, it&#39;s a real shame we&#39;re still fighting over land, resources, and control. I at least hope that my children and their children are born into a America that&#39;s better than the one we live in today. The way I see it, if things continue like they have, in 20 or so years there will be 
a massive reform in our government, (prob another revolution/civil war) 
it will become so destabilized that life as we know it and enjoy will plunge into all out anarchy, or 
The same stuff that&#39;s been happening will continue to happen because we are virtually powerless to stop it or do anything about it. 
Let&#39;s face it, our country&#39;s government has grown much larger, invasive, and for the elite instead of the people than our founding fathers ever wanted or could fathom. After we gained independence, everyone more or less agreed that if the government grew to be too big and/or oppressive, that we as Americans have a civic duty to do something about it and fight tyranny and for real freedom to the death. I don&#39;t believe much could be done anyway even if a majority of the population rebelled and fought back, how&#39;re you going to compete with drone strikes, missiles, tanks, huge ass bombs, etc. </p>
