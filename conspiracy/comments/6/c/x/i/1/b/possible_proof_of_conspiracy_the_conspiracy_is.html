       and give it credibility because it would be condemning their superiors. I have personally found over ten subs that have very suspicious post and comment history, so I have gone out of my way to make them say "pizzagate" and none of them will say it. They will use "PG", but none of them will say the actual term.
      </p>
      <p>
       These people are paid to change the narrative, they are psyops, they are ideological subversion.
      </p>
      <p>
       So try it yourself and see it for yourself. 
Step 1:
Find anyone that is fiercely fighting for the MSM narrative of Seth Rich being a hoax, pizzagate being a hoax, or that the trump Russian collusion is real.
      </p>
      <p>
       Step 2: 
Check their history. These shills will have a somewhat newer acct and their only posts or comments will be driving home the MSM narrative.
      </p>
      <p>
       Step 3: 
Bring up pizzagate and make them say it.
      </p>
      <p>
       They won't don't it. It's as easy as that.

       That's a right wing news site.  I just showed you the official Metro PD investigation page.  It is not closed.  Murders never are.  They go cold after a while but they stay open.  I'm sure there is plenty of pressure on both of those detectives to solve this given the media swirling around it, but what would you have them do?
       <br/>
       The guy was killed at 4 am in the morning and none of it was on camera.  There were no witnesses at the scene.  You can test bullets and determine cause of death but unless someone comes forward (hopefully the reward motivates) there's not a whole lot that can be done, unless you have have some ideas?

       And yet, I pointed you to the page that shows there is an investigation.  Do you downvote everyone who has a discussion with you?  I also, again, ask what you expect these detectives to do.  They're not psychic.  Someone needs to come forward and rat the killer(s) out.  1/3 of murders in this country go unsolved.  It's a sad but true statistic.

       I'm suggesting that they were asked to leave the case alone. There is currently no investigation into the DNC and Seth Rich. The police haven't contacted Kim.com have they? How about Assange? How about Guccifer 2.0? What investigation work has been done?

       I don't attack you, I just ask for proof. What is different about the two topics is that there are people with solid reasons to believe that the DNC killed Seth Rich, with people even offering sworn testimony. In the Trump/Russia conspiracy there is nothing. No evidence, no people stepping up with anything, nothing. That's the difference. Oh, and the fact that Trump isn't hiding anything and got you your special investigator. Where's Seths special investigator?

       I checked OP's history and I found that the 5 day old account was a "somewhat never account"  and their "only" posts -- at the rate of about 30 an hour!!! -- are short, easy comments pushing a Donald Trump/Republican narrative, sometimes including links to known partisan Fake News sites.

       Try it out for yourself, it just uses your social media and information pertinent to your area. It's all shit that is free to see on the internet, they aren't some sort of conspiratorial geniuses like you're making them out to be. It's just focus tested advertising based on what has always sold to our areas.

       You better be careful calling out new accounts. I got a warning last night from a mod for saying like "3 day old account" and that's it. Gave me a final warning. Not to mention today I had a "person" here post about 10 comments I made calling out only account age and then I was downvoted to hell.

       Lucky you. You take care too man, glad we can change the topic to just come to terms with eachother as humans. Yesterday I was trying to calm this crazy dude in this sub down because he was saying he's going to buy firearms and prepare for an upcoming civil war. Then claimed that Freemasons tried chasing him and killing his dog. That type of thinking is not normal, but he didn't understand that. So I'm a little worried at how some people are interpreting conspiracies.

       You also don't follow any of the characteristics that I put forward. The shills won't go against their given narrative, they can't. I will say this fuck Podesta, he's a child rapist and pizzagate/pedogate is very much real. Trump needs to drain the fucking swamp, which includes getting Ivanka and Kushner out of his cabinet, they are counter productive. And I will turn on Trump faster than you can say "Prescott Bush was a Nazi" if Trump doesn't fight against the globalists. My alliances are to the constitution, not to a political party.

       Fuck you, fuck trump, pizzagate is not real, although child abuse does occur and is worth fighting against. Obviously someone killed Seth rich. I don't know who, and guess what? Neither do you.

       Thinking shills can't say certain words is as ignorant as thinking cops can't lie or commit crimes to get their bust.

       You say that, yet it's still happens. What about pizzagate isn't real? The fact that they were all using the code words? Yes, they were. The fact that the symbolism was found to be consistent with the FBI information? Yes it was. The fact that James Allefantis has pedophilia verbiage all over his Instagram? He does. I could go on for hours, so tell me what about it wasn't real?

       Wow, such bravery and depth. I literally asked you to enlighten me, and you're going to refuse because I can't disprove speculation? Im not trolling you, I would have read your in depth summary and analysis. I understand why a paranoid like yourself might be wary, and emperor forbid you use your time in such a fashion instead of insightful comments like denying what YOU wish to be untrue.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't defend pedophillia, and don't want kids being molested. I'm not against an investigation, into alefantis's doings or the killing of Seth rich. I am about the truth. What I am not about is motherfuckers claiming speculation and suspicion as factual evidence. I am not all about people who ONLY question what they don't like.
      </p>
      <p>
       While I'm absolutely guilty of sometimes claiming absolutes myself, I do try to avoid them. If it hadn't been for your stupid litmus test, I'd have ignored your topic, but that's just plain incorrect information presented as fact. I hate hate the direction he's actually talking our country, in part because i'm NOT an authoritarian, militant, member of the ruling elite.
      </p>
      <p>
       You want to help find Seth rich's killer? Go outside, get transportation, and talk to the people involved, to the people on the streets. Talk to members of the DNC', find out important stuff, like who's their hit men, was it the police? Random thug? I can speculate, too. Maybe they told a junkie he had a script of oxy and where he would be, what they tried rob him of wasn't there in the 1st place.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do not doubt that people have been ordered killed, although I'd think those under the highest levels of scrutiny would not be issuing the kill orders, unless they are in an actual position of unaccountability. Those sanctioned to do so are just that, not that I agree.which reminds me,  Trump has now officially killed way more than one person, on that scale. I'm actually anti war, but it's hilarious how the script has flipped from canadite trump. I'll give credit where it's due, bomb the shit out of em is very much so a followed through campaign promise.  I'm no fool, there would not have suddenly been world peace with the election of ANY one individual. I did vote clinton, because trump isn't trustworthy or competent. I did like a few of his ideas and points, for sure. I'd be happy to boot every single official in DC and re vote under a better democratic system.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd love to get the $ and corruption out of politics, and away from profit prisons and a broken justice system. I'm sick of military spending and unnecessary spending both, but do fully support the concept of UBI and TRUE basic healthcare and education over our existing saftey nets. I do not think vaccinations are bad, but they need stricter oversight and testing, and those concerns are suppressed by the stupid autism red herring scapegoat. Profit margins are hardly good breeding ground for trust, and our entire system is proof Of this.
      </p>
      <p>
       For sake of litmus test, pizzagate,yes do bust sickpedahpilhes  , fuck Hillary rodham Clinton cause she ugly and an establishment politician  and fuck donal j trump because he's a swindling. Liar. If I didn't live in Ohio, I'd have voted stein , or maybe even Johnson, of fuck even vermin supreme. I liked sanders my only ever $  political contribution was 5 bucks for Bernie. But I HATE how much they spend on these campaigns, it's disgusting. .. um fuck podesta and he'll the whole rest of the DNC and GOP. They're almost all crooked as fuck. 
I would actually be astounded if there was DIRECT collusion between trump and Russia, but I do believe much of the dossier ( but probably not the piss thing, that's just stupid) I said based on reality and at there is $ that can't be disclosed. I think they knew about this in the GOP, and their own establishmentarian nature backfired, bigly. They did NOT want him to have the job. That did not mean he was the right choice. I do believe the clinton campaign fucked up and that both sides of the establishment are terrified of the wave of antiestablishment support and greatly underestimated the fury of the people. I'll concede they fucked up by suppressing Bernie, he very well might have won in his own anti campaign. The taking question thing was dumb, but I didn't get the idea that it was an ordered thing, and that SO much of these activities are not. Someone fightingbthe deep state might need to reti=hink how partisan they might actually be and that if they're not entirely evil ( literally half as possible) that they simply think he's bad for the future?
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the FUCK are trumps orders on pizza gate or Seth? Why isn't HE demanding more investigations?

       I also acknowledge there are shills at play on the internet, and that this sub in particular is vulnerable and targeted. Every single day in this sub there is a post like this, how share blue or ctr are rampant, now you're here spreading the idea that shills can't say certain things, which is ridiculous, and even though we may have opposing viewpoints, a harmful piece of info on actually identifying "persona "accounts.
      </p>
      <p>
       You make strong claims, as factual , but refuse to back it up, then blame insults or play the gatekeeper. These are old school tactics. Maybe I shouldn't be a dick, true, but you're awfully borderline insulting yourself, and seemingly guilty of some of what you accuse others of. That's highly suspect.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you're really part of the anti culture that's been breeding, the anti OC anti SJW crowd, it's fucking hilarious that you're offended by broad insults people on Reddit on you accusing shills post, where you're afraid of evil hippie words.

       I'm not offended at all, I just don't give respect when none is given. This is /conspiracy, can I not post what I feel is a legitimate conspiracy? the truth is I can't post other people's user names but I have been doing this for days and the same people will not say that John Podesta was affiliated with pizzagate. It's really strange and it does make sense. They will maneuver around the question and never say it. I am allowed to post possible conspiracies on THE CONSPIRACY SUBREDDIT. Jesus.

       Oh, you absolutely are, but to make a post like this then get all indignated at honestly minor insults and refuse to read something after refusing to provide asked for and relevant information because i think pizzagate is a red herring? As you'd know if you'd bothered, I'm super down for those matters to be investor-gated, if there's child abuse on a massive scale that's one of the few things I'd support stuffing the prison complex with. IMO, and related, CPS is a bad agency with too much $ corruption, and many horror stories based on fact. They do some good for sure, there is a need for a advocate/group  to protect children, it just needs to be further from the court and pharmaceutical industries.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not above saying sorry, if you were  so offended, but I don't entirely trust your persona either, and it's sad that you didn't want to elaborate on why you believe the pizzagate story is entirely?/partially? True. I acknowledged there is some basis in reality in that there are some who abuse children in such a manner. As an anti theist, I will acknowledge that my truly held belief is that the majority of world leaders use belief as a tool, but that most have no such true faith in a higher power than themselves. It's political suicide to say otherwise anyhow, use the tools you have. Therefore, I discredit most "satanic" conspiracies as they have traditionally been used as propaganda. I can't defend individual offenders, like podesta, because all I ever saw in the pizza gate was a driven narrative and
       <em>
        maybe
       </em>
       someone being thrown under the bus , but even that seems to be a dead end. I still support an investigation, but not one that is already convinced.

       That means nothing, even if they did stab theirselves, which that is Not proof of. The whole thing is sensationalislt bullshit to prey on the fears of the religious right. It was dropped when it was, for a reason.

       Shit like this is exactly why no one listens, I ask for proofs, and you send me screenshots with circles, as irrefutable proof of all kinds of shit, but refuse to even look and make sure the emperor is actually wearing clothes. And he's already admitted with his own mouth he's a globalist, never mind the properties and golf courses, and the rest of the facts, that creepy old fucker did weird art shit, burn them at the stake!

       Still dumb stuff, means nothing. I'm not trying to be in denial of the fact it's weird creepy shit. Fuck what people get away with as art , it's pathetic. I just don't think it's actually a satanic ritual, that you can gain power from such things , or that those in power believe that either. I do acknowledge that some pagans love symbols etc, and being taboo, but there's nothing substantial there, and basic willpower and manifestation of goals are the only reason ANY rituals may have a placebo effect on humans. All magic is bullshit. I do believe in some amount of predestination, but only on a quantum level. There is strong circumstantial evidence for bonds between humans, like twins and lovers, and very powerful instincts, should we choose to let them speak.
      </p>
      <p>
       Aside from all of that, is the deep state you speak of also the military industrial machine? What exactly are we talking here, shadow government/the now dirty "I" word? Globalist NWO council? Jews and the media? All of the above? The red skull?
      </p>
      <p>
       Of this is true, where's their special  council? What happened to lock her up? If trump is really "woke: and against the deep state, AND CAN DECLASSIFY WHATEVER HE WANTS, why is THIS still a theory, and not something that has been stopped? Wouldn't it be an absolute top priority? And the killing of Seth rich?

       I don't think that my "side" won. We won an election and that is just the beginning. Like I said earlier, I will flip on Trump the second I see him turn globalist. She should be locked up, she cheated in a Presidential Election.

       And as far as the satanic worship that they do goes, it doesn't matter what you believe, it only matters what they believe and the Babylonian Mystery religion isn't just a conspiracy talking point, it's everywhere, in all places of power. From Washington DC to the Vatican. It doesn't matter what you believe, only what they believe.

       It goes far deeper that pegan shock artists. Allister Crawley, Mystery Babylon, and Pedophilia goes waaaaay deeper than some artists. You need to read up and then we will have a discussion. You don't even see the end game from where you are with all of this.

       Haha thanks! I feel like I am doing too much though. I have removed like a bazillion comments, legitimately, but it is just weird for me. I am trying though! Trying to be fair and just follow the rules. Some of the posts I have approved made me gag though.

       It goes far deeper that pegan shock artists. Allister Crawley, Mystery Babylon, and Pedophilia goes waaaaay deeper than some artists. You need to read up and then we will have a discussion. You don't even see the end game from where you are with all of this.
