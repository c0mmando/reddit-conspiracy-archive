       Please this is getting very old. This conspiracy has already been debunked, and Kim Dotcom has been exposed as the fraud he is. Where is the actual evidence that DNC is behind the murder of Seth Rich??? There is no evidence. NONE. This is a tired and fake conspiracy. Let us please all move on from this. The real conspiracy is how Russia covertly hacked and rigged the US presidential election. The real conspiracy is how Trump and many within his administration have strong ties to the Kremlin. The real conspiracy is how Wikileaks is controlled by the Kremlin. This is where all of our efforts and energy should be put towards. Let Seth Rich rest peacefully instead of digging up his name every second. I ask the mods to please delete and ban any Seth Rich related posts and discussions. This type of discussion only hurts the credibility of

       Also there is no satanic pedophile cult. This is another ridiculous conspiracy that needs to be buried ASAP. Thank you.

       You say this, just as the other side says the opposite and says to stop talking about Russia and to talk about Seth Rich.  Both extremes act the same just about different things.

       You could filter for anything related to Seth Rich and not have to see the posts, just as you can filter out Russia.

       The big difference is that the Russian-Trump conspiracy is far more real and is backed by plenty of evidence and testimony. Whereas Seth Rich conspiracy is backed by nothing but delusion.
      </p>
      <p>
       And yes I could filter but many people won't and those people will see these lies being spread about who murdered Seth Rich. The truth is it was a botched robbery and we should just leave it at that. There is no reason to investigate the "who" and "what". Lets please just move on.

       I'm not going to argue one way or another (truth be told, I probably think it's important to concentrate on the same things as you) but I don't think conversation should be limited to a particular topic. There are many posts on both topics, Russia and Seth, saying to ignore the other side and stop talking about it. Both stories have certain things pointing to them that make them interesting conversations, even though no hard proof has been provided.  I don't think Seth Rich having leaked to Wikileaks would invalidate the Russia-Trump conspiracy, just as if the Russia-Trump conspiracy is true that I don't see how it could prove Seth Rich didn't leak anything. I don't think they're mutually exclusive.

       Are you fucking kidding me? You need to revisit the last 18 months.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where is the Trump/Russia proof? Just because a democrat says Trump colluded with Russians doesn't means it happened. Same with Seth and his murder. Just because Hannity says its a conspiracy doesn't make it a conspiracy. BUT there are a lot more fucked up bits of
       <em>
        ACTUAL
       </em>
       evidence Seth's murder was a hit job.
      </p>
      <p>
       If Trump and Russia are in bed together then when we get the special prosecutors report and there is actual
       <em>
        PROOF
       </em>
       of collusion then he can be held accountable.

       The mods try to avoid censorship where they can.  It is a conspiracy sub after all.  The interesting thing is that being suspicious of the government was always a conservative phenomenon going back decades but you'll see now that many progressives also don't trust the government going back to 9/11.  Just like JFK I don't think we'll ever know the truth about 9/11.  We know the Saudi's financed it and our government clearly had a hand in it but that's about it.

       's reputation and makes everyone here look delusional. Again, this fake conspiracy has already been debunked plenty of times. There is no conspiracy here. A good man was unfortunately murdered in a botched robbery. DNC, Podesta, Hillary, and Donna bRazile weren't involved in anyone's murder.

       I agree, but I think this sub tries to shy away from censorship even when it starts getting ridiculous.  There is no evidence of this.  There is also no evidence of Trump &amp; Russia colluding.  There is evidence of Michael Flynn conspiring with Russia to lift sanctions before Trump took office and then lying to the FBI about it.  There is also evidence of Flynn being paid by the Turkish government while he was working on the campaign and through to the inauguration day at which he made certain strategic decisions during the transition regarding an Isis strike when asked about it by the Obama Administration.  This will come out when Robert Mueller is done with his full investigation.  It's likely Manafort will go down too.  I don't like Roger Stone but he clearly maintained enough distance that he probably won't be charged with anything.
