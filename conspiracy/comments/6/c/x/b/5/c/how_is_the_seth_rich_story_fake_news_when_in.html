       Why wouldn't they kill him though? If the Russia narrative is true, except the Russians themselves never hacked the DNC servers, but Rich took the data and delivered it to WikiLeaks, who then timed their info releases based on Chestnut from Russia, then Rich would know too much. He's a loose end.
      </p>
      <p>
       So what do you do with loose ends?
      </p>
      <p>
       It's got as much evidence (none) as the DNC having him killed because he stole data and gave it to WikiLeaks.

       A "political tool?" So if the someone from the DNC really did have something to do with his death, you would be fine with the continued coverup just so it doesn't "help the other side?" The people that are arguing against his death being any kind of conspiracy because they don't like who is implicated in that conspiracy are just as bad as the people who want to solve it JUST because of who it will damage.
      </p>
      <p>
       Believe it or not, some of us want ALL corruption and lies uncovered regardless of who it implicates. This argument is ridiculous, because it generalizes a very large group of people, and it's only used by those who are ridiculously partisan themselves. The hypocrisy is astounding.

       You know what the first thing you do when you just murdered someone in a botched robbery, by accident? YOU GET THE FUCK OUT OF THERE. You think they were thinking about robbing or the money in his pocket after that gun went off? Fuck no, they were thinking about the life sentence they just walked into.  They fucking booked it.

       Here's a possible scenario.
      </p>
      <p>
       He's walking home, a man walks up to him and pulls a gun, tells him to give him his wallet and phone. Somewhere in the distance a car backfires, startling the mugger who then fires his gun as a reflex. Not planning on murdering someone, he runs away without stealing anything.
      </p>
      <p>
       People present the DNC/Clinton narrative because they think they've linked some massive conspiracy and because the concept of a totally senseless murder can't be made to make sense. So they make sense of it the best they can.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are absolutely reasonable explanations for this murder that aren't international intrigue.

       Have you ever been to Flagler and V?  My girlfriend used to live on V between 1st and North Cap.  I don't remember ever seeing a camera.  Also, itis not uncommon for a murder at 4:19am in a residential neighborhood to have no witnesses, even in the nice parts of town.  Furthermore, everyone in D.C. knows about Shotspotter.  If you fire a gun, you better start running because you have got 2-3 minutes before the cops arrive.  At that time of night, it would probably be GRU too.

       Pretty sure there weren't cameras in this area, which is why it was perfect for criminals to repeatedly rob people in the construction area. The community was asking for a greater police presence or lighting, and the  Seth got killed

       I think it was a bad robbery for one simple reason. Nothing was taken. If I was gonna murder someone and make it look like a robbery I would take his wallet and dump it. I think he was getting robbed but instead of giving the robber his stuff he fought back and he was shot. Robber gets spooked and runs.

       But they were smart enough to get away before the police showed up, which is pretty fast in a city with ShotSpotters. They got away, can't say they're the worst robbers ever.

       I'm going to go out on a limb here and say, these organizations (and DNC admitted to this if I recall correctly) have notoriously bad security practices in place - add to that the nature of Seth's own role (data analytics) and it suggests he was quite skilled with computers. Just combine those two elements.

       You going "out on a limb" and claiming that "these organizations (and DNC admitted to this if I recall correctly) have notoriously bad security practices in place", is pure speculation unless you provide evidence to the contrary. Also, their security has no implications on whether Seth Rich stole the emails. Many people had easier access and it provides no motive.  You're just attempting to muddy the water to push your narrative.

       Man, so much anger and hatred coming through your messages. Either you're a shill (based on your previous mentions of the ridiculous russia narrative) or you're so far gone and addicted to the mainstream narratives that any kind of conversation is mostly pointless. All I have are my eyes, ears, and logic. I have found the complete lack of coverage of this matter, despite the evidence that something went down (how is it a robbery if nothing was stolen, why do law enforcement officials have his laptop as the very start...) to be very suspect.
      </p>

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Why would the FBI have any involvement in the case? Why would they have his laptop if they aren't involved? If they are involved, why do they have his laptop?
      </p>
      <p>
       Then pile on that the MSM narratives around this being yet another conspiracy theory (have you looked into the origins of that phrase), as well as paid shills clearly trying to slide and disrupt every meaningful progress/post on this do be even more enlightening.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do appreciate you pointing me in the direction of certain things (investigator wasn't hired by the family) and happy to look into that.

       You also haven't answered my questions...

       Confused by your comments. There's clearly circumstantial evidence that some weird stuff went down. Then there's the investigator the family themselves hired that has stated a) police were told by higher ups to stand down and b) there's evidence that supports Seth leaked to WikiLeaks.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your profile doesn't look like you're a shill, but do you not like this information because you're afraid it would ruin a political narrative (Russia) for a president and administration you don't agree with?
      </p>
      <p>
       To dispute this further, I think it's quite admirable that a people (4chan) seems to be leading the charge on this and they're often associated with the appointment of Trump (republicans/right-wingers).

       In this sub in particular, I've seen a ton of misinformation about Seth Rich.
      </p>
      <p>
       Videos of his family are taken out of context and used as evidence that "they really do want the issue investigated" even though they released an op-ed piece basically pleading with people to stop.
      </p>

       The idea that the pandas4bernie reddit account was Seth's was a story that literally came from this subreddit, the user who "broke the story" then went back and said it wasn't true. That was three days ago, people are still treating the account like it's his. I've seen people acting as if it's highly suspicious that the person behind the account cleared up that it wasn't them. These are just a few examples of misinformation.

        If you want to be mad at anybody for this, look at the mainstream media and the pulpit they stand on. If they are the greatest perpetrator, why should regular people act differently? Your issue is the media's fault.

      <p>
       I don't get what your point is on this. Because the media lies to us, it's also okay for other sources to lie to us? Because honestly, I've seen people knowingly lie about the Seth Rich case because it furthers their point.
      </p>
      <p>
       The truth is that there has been no new information learned in the past week, yet this sub has been astroturfed with content about Seth Rich, making sure we "don't forget about it" because certain groups of people don't want us to focus on anything else

       no, i'm saying let's be as critical towards the media as people are getting over the Seth Rich stuff. We've been on a wild goose chase for 4 months over exaggerated charges relating to Russia, yet now we're being hyper-critical because the subject has changed. It's disingenuous.

       Wow, as somebody who has been on this subreddit for 5+ years, you have no idea what you are talking about. The astroturf is coming from the other direction, friend. That's where things really differ - you're standing on a clear side and i'm just trying to figure things out. You're biased in your comment, and it shows. Seth Rich's murder is absolutely worth investigating, and anybody who is detracting from it either not doing their due diligence or they are compromised. We should always be for truth and justice, and Seth Rich's killers were not brought to justice.

       Additionally, if he did die in hospital, the story should reflect that, even if it was just an unfortunate incident or procedure that went wrong. All the spin to the story is what is training attention on this, and the more that people like yourself try to obstruct, the more intrigue you create on your opponents' end. It's a losing battle.

       You can hold multi-view points at one time. No it's not good if those trying to uncover the truth have motives outside of justice. But to imply it's in anyway the same as those that committed and are actively covering this up is preposterous. People can be right, even if you THINK they may have a motive that doesn't gel with your position. I'm still confused by your comment. Telling me to re-read doesn't help.

       Spreading intel (agenda?) with bad information is terrible, however I've learned speaking the truth is more about being willing to speak, and the occasional disinformation is and of itself a means by which people are silenced. We say to ourselves "we don't want to be wrong."

       Back to the point, non of your responses, although maybe well-intention-ed seem to do anything but distract from the original post which has merit - PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO SOLVE A MURDER AND PROVIDE SOME JUSTICE TO SOMEONE THAT DIED. I might add to that - entirely circumstantial based on the idea that he was the leaker to Wikileaks and based on Kim Dot Com's (possibly) bullshit statements about his connections to Rich and his desire to start a new political party in the U.S. (although the timelines and light it casts on his previous statements about WL being Hillary's worst nightmare makes much more sense now...)... that we're also trying to provide meaning and value to someone that was killed that was fighting for our freedoms in their own way.

       He was not hired by the family, he was a Fox news contributor who was hired by a third party (it's speculated it might be Ed Butowsky, who is involved in both Fox and Breitbart).  The family actually sent the PI a cease and desist to stop his investigation:

       I believe the independent researchers here and on 4chan do give a flying shit about Seth and his family. The fact that it seems to align with hating the DNC is suspect sure. But I think it's larger than that. "Drain the swamp" was an idea of recognition for how things are. Getting rid of bad actors, no matter their party affiliation is a good thing. Are you a democrat?

       You don't get to make up your definition of circumstantial evidence. Innuendo, speculation and bias are not circumstantial evidence. That's just gossip. You want an example of actual circumstantial evidence? A fingerprint at the scene of a crime. Got anything like that?

       Why would it matter? You're doing the same thing to me, attempting to smear me with innuendo.  The very fact that you have an opinion that a "democrat" would automatically attempt to cover up the truth and is in some way suspicious pretty much destroys your claim of being impartial in draining the swamp.

       Forgive my ignorance, but does this matter? Does Wikileaks immediately release all information they get? There isn't any kind of delay, like Wikileaks having to organize the information or something like that?
      </p>
      <p>
       I think it's important because if there's a legitimate reason that Wikileaks wouldn't release the information right away, then the timing of Seth Rich's death would still be suspicious. However, if Wikileaks doesn't do that and they leaked the information immediately, it is obviously a big problem for people claiming Seth Rich was assassinated for being the DNC leaker.

       If you'lll notice, the people pushing this theory are blatantly lying, and constantly. Pretending the video for GoFundMe supporters was for the internet "investigators," claiming that the story came out BEFORE the Trump-Russia bombshell that day, claiming the Twitter account belonged to him even after it was thoroughly debunked.

       The fact that this has been so politicized - by Hannity, Assange, KDC - I mean it's pretty obvious they have ulterior motives.  I don't like Clinton, but I don't think she murdered anyone.

       He died 12 days before wikileaks released the DNC emails. The second batch of emails, titled the "Podesta emails", contains exchanges dated a year earlier in which they acknowledge that their previous emails had been leaked, and that the suspected leaker was assumed to be within the party, and that this person needs to be made an example of.

       It's not exactly clear what they're talking about. They mentioned "leaking" and "talking with the press" separately, as two separate issues. Why are
       <em>
        you
       </em>
       so sure? Reasonably, I could be asking you to explain.

       Read the email please.
They're clearly talking about individual leakers leaking anything or talking at all to the press. 
The use the phrase "make an example" multiple times in the exchange, and the only time "marketing" is used in the original link to an article that exposes information on marketing strategies that were leaked. They aren't talking about particularly leaking this kind of information. They mean any kind of information. At all. Ill back up these claims. Here are some direct quotes from the email exchange
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        No one – literally no one talked to the press in either
Obama campaign without clearing it with campaign brass.
       </p>
       <p>
        I think we have to make examples now of people who have violated the trust
of HRC and the rest of the team. People going forward need to know there
are stiff consequences for leaking, self-promotion, unauthorized talking
with the press.
       </p>
       <p>
        I agree--when we have press staff, this will be MUCH easier.
And I would love an example being made.
       </p>
       <p>
        I'm definitely
for making an example of a suspected leaker whether or not we have any real
basis for it.

       Maybe they already had suspicions he leaked the emails or was attempting to leak them? Kill him then. Cover up the hole and work on damage control.

      <p>
       The emails don't have to leak before he is murdered. It also takes Wikileaks time to go through it themselves and verify authenticity.

       The vast majority (I believe) are just sitting there wanting to get to the bottom of what happened and wondering why there was no legitimate investigation and wondering why it was considered a robbery despite nothing being taken.

       If you shoot someone in a robbery gone bad you don't spend time take lots of stuff which will link you to murder/assault with weapon, it's not worth it, you get the heck out. Not saying that's what happened, but it's at least as plausible.

       There are many questions surrounding his murder that haven't been answered.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why would the police take his laptop (and apparently still have it) if his murder was just a 'botched robbery' BUT they never bothered to question the staff in the bar he was last seen? Basic investigation protocol.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why do the police apparently have 1 grainy piece of footage of the supposed robbery but not release it to anyone, namely their family which is normal protocol?
      </p>
      <p>
       These are just 2 unanswered questions and nobody seems to be following up on any leads into the case.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is why most people are highly suspicious of the Seth Rich mystery - the obvious cover up taking place.

       You're spreading false information. I wouldn't and can't say for certain that you're lying because I would have to know your motivation. It's equally possible you're just very gullible and don't care to research the lies that you're told be others.

       Well I do. There's plenty of obvious things wrong with the investigation. The most obvious of which is that the finding of a robbery (after almost no time) makes no sense considering nothing was taken.

       I've got news for you: these news sources are not credible. Source your claims or get the fuck out. Washington Post was shown to fake how many stories in the past 3 weeks? It's more than one.

       Name one person besides Comey who has seen the thing. Anonymous sources are not evidence. They can easily be bullshit. If the memo is real I'd be happy to say that. I'm just saying there's no actual evidence it exists. People lie.

       It's absolutely not standard for nothing to be taken, even if they ended up having to shoot Rich. This is false.

       Talk about the pot calling the kettle black. This issue started as an attempt to control the national media conversation, Fox News pushed a murder conspiracies with no basis. They had no new evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       In fact it was worse than that, the whole thing was based on something one of their associates made up, told to one of their private investigators, and then reported as his discovery from a confidential source after he repeated it back. And people here call MSN fake news! All of this while an innocent family of a murder victim for nearly a year ago begged them to stop.
      </p>
      <p>
       Before Fox News published their retracted story. I'd buy your argument. In fact I do think there’s smoke her.  But like it or now, this sub was turned into a tool of the right-wing media. Our entire front page was filled with this story, while the president was busy selling arms to Saudi Arabia, and Flynn was preparing to plead the Fifth. +1 Fox news
      </p>
      <p>
       So we got played, and now you try to take the high ground? Sorry, but I don't buy it. All the people here pushing this story with no new evidence, are tools and should be ashamed. The family has suffered enough. And now you are trying to use them to help “your side”.

       Again another strawman argument. It's not about people "looking". It's about this sub getting used as a right-wing political tool. Fox new chose the narrative and people like you pushed it. You may truly believe it. But by blindly repeating their fake new without any critical thinking, you were just a pawn in their partisan game.
      </p>
      <p>
       The true free thinkers around here could see that this story reeked of a distraction piece and careful. They were on the right side, you were on the wrong side. You don't give a shit about the family. You don't give a shit about the truth. You just want us talking about whatever Fox news wants.

       Just like they solved the "real" Pizzagate?  There are 700 children abducted a day in the U.S. and no one is disputing that it's a serious problem.  It's just focusing on a family pizza shop in D.C. far from Congress and the White House seems silly.  It's also a narrative that's being pushed by Russia, just like this one.

       Good question.  It's a mix.  57% come home so so I guess the real number should be 301.  I mean, any number is too high but that's 6 kids per state per day.

       Having trouble finding a good source, but i'm getting much higher numbers than that, but they don't state what percent are returned/murdered/found/still lost/etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       It states 2,000 go missing per day, 800k per year, and there is roughly 100 thousand missing persons cases open at any given time.  Are they solving the other cases or just tossing them?  I'm so confused, because the numbers don't add up, it seems like with that high of report rate, there should be a lot more not found at all, and hence their cases should remain open.

       Most missing persons are located quickly, and the vast majority of them are alive and well. 99% of missing children come home alive.
      </p>
      <p>
       The 57% survival rate is only for children 17 and under who are abducted by strangers. And that's about 115/year.

       It's a really common misconception even without number confusion! A lot of people have the idea that kids are at high risk to be kidnapped by a stranger, and that's not true (but it's possible, so watch your kids!).
      </p>
      <p>
       IIRC, the majority of those 115ish cases are teenage girls, but I don't have any stats on that right now.

       He was probably.... You are saying it like it's a fact. The fact is there has never been a report of a laptop stolen from him and I'm sure his family would have noticed if there was. Hell even the DNC shill spokesman would have put out a notice saying the laptop was stolen the night he was murdered if that was the case since it was reported the authorities had it. The fact that he didn't dispute that leads me to believe that some law enforcement agency does have his laptop. The fact is that the family could easily shut down some of the speculation by answering a few questions through their DNC shill, but they don't which is only going to further spread the conspiracy.

       Does it matter where? It was reported on tv and radio shows. You can search seth rich laptop dc police fbi and see plenty of reports. The FBI said hey weren't investigating the case, but we know the DC Police is and they could easily say we do not have Seth Rich's laptop. Pretty easy things to clear up in the conspiracy world if they wanted to imo.

       Well to answer my own question, the laptop is only reported by the crackhead puppet that foxnews hired to distract you from the congressional intelligence committee testimony happening this week.  Basically that whole story was made up and they've since retracted it.  But that didn't stop Breitbart, RT, and so many others from relaying the information to make it sound genuine to you.

       I just found an article stating that Jack Burkman and his team had access to Seth's laptop and found no evidence of emails between Seth and Wikileaks, but that honestly doesn't mean shit. He could have contacted wikileaks from any number of devices which don't have to be his own. I believe Assange said the emails were given to someone representing them in person in DC, likely on a thumbdrive. So that whole made up story could have been put out by the DNC to make any future claims less believable. Whatever the truth is though, I hope Justice is served to those responsible for his death.

        "They found that the Russian government pursued a multi-faceted influence campaign in the run-up to the election, including aggressive use of cyber capabilities.  The Russians used cyber operations against both political parties, including hacking into servers used by the Democratic National Committee and releasing stolen data to WikiLeaks and other media outlets. Russia also collected on certain Republican party-affiliated targets, but did not release any Republican-related data. The Intelligence Community Assessment concluded, first, that President Putin directed an influence campaign to erode the faith and confidence of the American people in our presidential election process. Second, that he did so to demean Secretary Clinton.  And, third, that he sought 
to advantage Mr. Trump.  These conclusions were reached based on the richness of the information gathered and analyzed, and were thoroughly vetted and then approved by the directors of the three agencies, and me."

       And you're a DNC parrot. Get some new talking points. Families don't get to decide how murder investigations take place or whether or not civilians can look into it themselves. If they have irrefutable proof to shut this theory down, then by all means have them show it. Just the way everything has gone down the last few days is suspicious. There are a lot of unanswered questions that need answers and this case has seeped into the public domain. If the whole thing about Seth getting the emails from the DNC, leaking them to wikileaks and being murdered for doing so are parts of a right wing conspiracy it should all be easily debunked with facts, but so far all we have gotten are excuses as to why people shouldn't investigate Seth's murder.

       There is no collusion with Seth being the victim of a DNC hit or a botched robbery. Keep parroting the DNC party line. Good little soldier. I just would like to know what the truth is. The is the definition of a good conspiracy. Sorry if you don't feel that way. Again though, this might not be the place for you if you can't even fathom that it could happen.

       So you admit that there is no proof Seth gave the mails to wikileaks? Good.

       Even if Seth's murder is shady, there is no proof pointing at the DNC. Could have been the Russian's too. Or the Saudi's (pick your favorite bad state here).

       They don't want anyone to find out, simple as that. It would be the crime of the decade, maybe century, if what many are alleging happened truly did.
      </p>
      <p>
       They will use the same old tactics:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "How dare you look into this murder when his family has asked everyone not to!"
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       No, actually they've stated they want further investigation. And no, a family doesn't get to tell the public to lose interest in a famous cold case. You can't just tell people to stop caring when the murderers are at large.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        You guys are just like the Sandy Hook deniers!
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Again, so totally wrong. Looking into someone's murder is nothing like denying murders happened. I've been seeing this one used a
       <strong>
        lot
       </strong>
       lately.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway - ignore these idiots. If they want to live in a world where they deny their government does shady shit, sobeit. They will be forever naive.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you don't think the government has the capability to do something like this, I suggest you read
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FBI%E2%80%93King_suicide_letter">
        this letter that the FBI sent to Martin Luther King Jr.
       </a>
       They can and do kill people that get in their way.

       If they were actually trying to solve a murder they would be gathering evidence and entertaining other possible perpetrators.  But they are not - it was immediately decided that it was the DNC, an now it's just fiction to fill in the blanks.

       I can respect the parent's rights to privacy, but they have no rights asking people to stop investigating their son's unsolved murder and in fact should be fucking grateful so many people care about finding out the truth when it seems as no one else is.

       Actually they did send a cease and desist letter to Fox News. Fox news had to retract the seth rich story after that lol. Poor Trumpkings you were rebunked not only by Seth family but your own news network as well.

       That's because Fox News is managed by a bunch of bitches that get scared of every little leftist tactic. Oh we will contact O'Reilly's sponsors to pressure Fox to fire him and now they want to do the same to Hannity, but I'm going to assume those tactics are cool with you. I'd like to see their lawyer start sending cease and desist letters to all the citizens looking into the case. Good luck with that. And I wonder who is paying that high priced fancy lawyer.  This case is in the public domain and I don't think they have a leg to stand on as far as legally shutting anyone down from talking about it. That would be a 1st for me if Americans can't talk about an unsolved murder.

       I'm shaking now. I will go delete all my accounts and never get online again. Oh please oh please don't send me a cease and desist letter for discussing a possible conspiracy on a conspiracy sub of reddit. I'm a monster and hope all can forgive me for wanting to know the truth about what happen. I have learned my lesson and now know to only listen to what liberal outlets tell me and will have my cerebrum worked on to remove my critical thinking ability. Of course it was just a botched robbery by 2 obviously expert criminals, experts that couldn't commit a simple robbery against a drunk man, and who have managed to avoid being caught despite a pretty sizable reward being offered. It all makes perfect sense now.

       I guess Chandra Levy's parents just didn't love her like Seth's parents do. How they can sleep at night not wanting to investigate any possibility regarding his murder is beyond me. Shame on them. I mean it would be one thing if Seth had no affiliation with the DNC, wasn't a Bernie supporter, and the police had arrested people and closed the case, but none of those are true and whether the family likes it or not, this case and people looking into are not going to go away. No matter how many cease and desist letters are sent (did they send one to DC Police too as they sure as hell aren't getting anywhere with their investigation if they are even doing one) people will not stop looking. His Name Was Seth Rich and shame on his parents and anyone else not wanting to truly find out what happened to him.

       Wow, the partisanship in this sub is getting ridiculous. He got shot and died. No one discussing it knows why. Calling it "a botched robbery" is just as baseless as calling it "a political assassination". It's an unsupported assertion, unless there's some huge piece of evidence pointing to a robbery than I'm missing. I was under the impression nothing was taken. How the hell do you get to "robbery" from that? Did the police have anything to go off of in order to deem it a robbery? I'm genuinely curious, because I have yet to hear of one single scrap of evidence for calling it that.
      </p>

       Just do a god-damned investigation so we can stop having this shit-throwing, blame game political hackery bullshit of a conversation where everybody just picks a side and claims anyone who disagrees is an idiot/shill/brainwashed.

       I'm more interested in what reasoning the police had in calling it a botched robbery in the first place. It's not beyond the realm of possibility for political corruption to infect the police, so when I keep hearing people call it "a botched robbery" without any actual reasoning, just citing that the police said so, that's not terribly convincing. However, if the cops had good evidence to indicate that it was in fact a robbery, then I can accept that.

       Perfect cover for an assassination. Were any of those 3 guns the one that was used to shoot Seth? Nope. Have any of those robbery suspects been charged with Seth's murder? Nope. Why are so so hell bent on trying to shut down discussion of a suspicious murder in a conspiracy sub? It would be one thing if the police have already made arrests and declared this case solved, but that's the farthest thing from the truth. Basically, you think it's impossible that Seth Rich was in fact the person that leaked the DNC emails. Is that correct? Zero possibility? A person who supported Bernie and worked in IT for the DNC could not have possibly leaked emails showing corruption in the DNC that affected his preferred candidate. I'm glad I will never be as closed minded as you. You certainly don't belong in a conspiracy sub.

       Actually, the idea that the Seth Rich story is a blatant disinformation campaign designed to deflect from Trump and Russian espionage is a legitimate conspiracy. As is Trump-Russia. A conspiracy forum is not the exclusive playground of increasingly desperate and hysterical Trump boosters and Russia-hack deniers.

       You are accusing other people of being partisan?  You will accept no evidence or contrary theory unless it implicates the DNC.  You don't solve a murder by picking who you want to be guilty and then fitting in circumstantial evidence to support your claim.

       You're reading what you want to read, not what I'm actually saying. I specifically stated that if the police had good reasoning for considering it a botched robbery that I can accept that conclusion. Someone else in another comment chain actually showed me that, therefore I accepted the conclusion.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you reread my last comment you'll see that I was actually being rather middle of the road. I wasn't just buying into the Seth Rich conspiracy theory.

       I'm amazed at how every time I express open-minded comments that amount to "it could be true. I'm not sure, but it's possible", I get nasty comments from people who don't believe in the theory about how partisan and deluded I am. it makes you guys look like partisan jaded democrats.

       Because there had been a spate of other armed robberies in that same neighborhood. Because he was out at 4 a.m. on a cell phone. Because someone else got robbed and pistol whipped in that same neighborhood within an hour of his shooting. Because he was wearing a nice watch and the person who killed him tore the band trying to get it off of him.

       I don't get my news from any of those sources and my response should have shown you that I'm willing to be educated on a topic, but I guess it's easier for you to self-aggrandize about how much more intelligent you are than anyone that disagrees with you than actually have a discussion.

       A botched robbery attempt by what one would have to assume are amateurs as they didn't get anything of value (other than Seth's life of course) and then shoot him, but don't bother to make sure they actually killed him so they didn't leave a witness yet somehow the 2 perps have managed to stay quiet and despite over $225K in reward money, there have been no solid leads. Riiiiiiiiggggghhhhhhttttttt. And people think the wikileaks thing is a conspiracy theory. HAHAHAHAHAHA

       There is literally 0 proof it was a botched robbery. You are going on the word of the known-to-be-corrupt DC cops who are going on????  Did they catch the guy? Has someone said "I was trying to Rob him"?
      </p>
      <p>
       Nothing was stolen so I'm not sure how you can come to the conclusion of "robbery" without some outside knowledge. Looks more like "killing" to me.

       I'm going off of what the police determined it to be (perhaps they are lying.  If they are lying that means the DNC/Clintons are threatening them not to talk; and if that's happening then the DNC/Clintons are also threatening the EMT's not to talk; and if that's happening then the DNC/Clintons are also threatening the hospital staff who worked on him.

       That's a whole lot of threatening.

       Nothing abt Occam's razor suggests robbery though. Simplest is that he just got shot honestly. Burglary is anti-Occams razor. Requires more work to believe, esp with nothing stolen.

       Actually no, it does suggest robbery. The area where he was murdered had recently been subject to a lot of stick up robberies. The simplest explanation isn't that someone just shot him, as that has no logical reasoning. The simplest explanation is that he was a victim of a stick up robbery and through some events, be it him resisting or a trigger happy robber, was shot.

       You keep inserting robber for no reason. It also looks like he got some people in DC angry and they had him shot.

       I don't see how this is less reasonable than a robbery where nothing is stolen? Robbery with nothing stolen and no evidence of robbery besides conjecture just makes no sense. But sure. Believe what you will.

       I would really like to hear a response on this from someone who thinks the conspiracy theory is bullshit. Is the report that his laptop was taken bullshit? If they did in fact take his laptop, is there a legitimate reason they would do this? It definitely looks shady, but I'm willing to listen to why it might not be.

       The only source I've heard of for the laptop was a 4chan LARPer so that's a lower level of vetting then a random Twitter account. That's even lower than a reddit account.

       So it is a bullshit claim? I'm really confused how often I see people relying on anonymous people from 4chan. I mean, I get that the mainstream media can't be trusted (operation mockingbird, demonstrated dishonesty during the election, media blackout on the DNC trial/Wikileaks, etc.), but that doesn't mean that any random dude on 4chan knows what the hell they are talking about. I guess it's just partisanship and confirmation bias.

       While it is possible that someone shitposts on 4chan and has a real job in the government, ever since the election there's been a series of LARPers pretending to work for the fbi or whoever promising "oh we're raiding dnc pedophiles on xx date" at least once a month.

       Since the message board is designed for anonymity amongst posters, you can't even check their postings against prior posts. At least here you can go through and see if Ivan forgot to switch to English or if they're only active during work hours, et cetera.
      </p>
      <p>
       PS it looks like some dude fox paid said they took the laptop, but fox also has a history of paying people to make ridiculous claims. But it's still more legitimate than 4chan.

       The only one making any claims about his laptop is a  crackhead that foxnews hired to go on TV to distract you from the senate and house intelligence committee testimony going on right now.  For all we know the laptop is what was stolen in the mugging.

       Okay.  Look at his profile page on Fox news.  Fox Contributor Rod Wheeler.  He goes on Fox News and Fox 5 all the time.  He is your quintessential pundit with mildly consequential credentials.

       I am just guessing he's a crackhead based on his face.  I've known more than a few crackheads in my time.

       Actually it's possible the laptop was what was stolen in the mugging.  The police only said that watch and phone weren't taken.  They don't know if he was carrying his messenger bag which is shown in many of his pictures.

       I don't think that is a very solid argument. People do work past 5 o'clock. Especially during am election if you are on the campaign. I just don't see how 3am automatically disqualifies coming home from work. I mean I have worked til 3am before... I know plenty of people who would say that is not uncommon.

       He was complaining to his GF about working so much at the DNC (it was a critical time after all).  He was at a bar after work doing bar things.  He doesn't seem like the kind of person to be into UFC (though the people "investigating" his murder definitely are)

       It doesn't matter if he was into it.  Every bar who wants to make a profit had those fights on.  Look up the card and the viewers for the event.  Biggest UFC event in history I believe.
      </p>

       That matters because it likely meant he knew he was going out to a very crowded bar that night.

       So your argument is that they intentionally didn't kill him at the time leaving while he was still breathing.

      <p>
       Then to make it look like a robbery they didn't steal anything.

       Or, and hear me out, if there's a scuffle and someone gets shot maybe the attacker doesn't want to hang out at the crime scene and gets out of there ASAP.

       It's considered fake news because people are throwing out unsubstantiated rumors without evidence (but claiming they have evidence) and assuming that the totality of law enforcement is on the take (and that this is  reasonable thing to believe).

       You keep inserting robber for no reason. It also looks like he got some people in DC angry and they had him shot.

       That's because Fox News is managed by a bunch of bitches that get scared of every little leftist tactic. Oh we will contact O'Reilly's sponsors to pressure Fox to fire him and now they want to do the same to Hannity, but I'm going to assume those tactics are cool with you. I'd like to see their lawyer start sending cease and desist letters to all the citizens looking into the case. Good luck with that. And I wonder who is paying that high priced fancy lawyer.  This case is in the public domain and I don't think they have a leg to stand on as far as legally shutting anyone down from talking about it. That would be a 1st for me if Americans can't talk about an unsolved murder.

       Haven't you been following the official Kremlin narrative? Only the CIA commits such vile acts as those. Only America is the villain.
