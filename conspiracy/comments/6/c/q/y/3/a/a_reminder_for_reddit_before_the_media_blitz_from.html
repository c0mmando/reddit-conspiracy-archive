<p>Actually objective observation, which you&#39;re borne with, is taken out of you by the customs of your parents. The Great Purple Elephant doesn&#39;t hold it against you. When he made Adam he also made all of his descendants and everyone said &quot;Oh my, we can objectively verify that we&#39;re all purple elephants.&quot; This was done so no one could have an excuse for not believing they were purple elephants. </p>

<p>The vast majority of Muslims would agree that there are Islamic practices a Muslim is obligated to keep, yes?</p>

<p>I&#39;m sure there are literalist and more philosophical branches of Islam, just as with every other religion. However, consensus reality is determined by how terms are used in relation to actions, there&#39;s not a deep underlying theological TRUTH behind these terms.</p>

CCTV is meant to help catch criminals after the fact, not prevent terrorism in the way you&#39;re discussing. In that regard, it doesn&#39;t matter if the country is the most watched in the world, especially not if the terrorists are okay with killing themselves/being killed at the scene.</p>

<p>Shit like this makes me sick. It will no doubt get compared to the 1996 IRA bomb. Ms. May will no doubt use it for some ugly political advantage... hell, The [can&#39;t be trusted] Sun has already started to spin the BS IRA anti-Corbyn message.* Corbyn still has more integrity in his left nostril than May. Don&#39;t get sucked into the IRA narrative. This is what the Tories want. Most peaceful people would choose public diplomacy over war. Do your own research. Remember, this atrocity happened on Theresa&#39;s watch! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yup.</p>

<p>They will rail road through some serious shit with popular support because of this.</p>

<p>I have no doubt this was committed by home grown extremists however was it allowed to happen.</p>

<p>May was falling in the polls, the young and poor hate her, 2 million more young people just registered to vote.</p>

<p>She&#39;s been terrible on tv and in interviews and has had to make several policy Uturn&#39;s after badly misjudging the public feeling.</p>

<p>This is extremely convenient for the tories.</p>

<p>Make no mistake I believe this was. A horrific and genuine attack but I absolutely fear the consequences of it for the freedom of the nation and its people. We are marching into a dystopian police state designed to extract wealth from the middle classes for the benefit of the rich. This will be done under the guise of safety and security and the defence of freedom.</p>

<p>I also find it rather strange that you still have a royal family in-spite of them not even having the legitimate claim to the crown, the actual head of the monarchy seems to be a farm hand in Australia.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Abney-Hastings,_14th_Earl_of_Loudoun">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Abney-Hastings,_14th_Earl_of_Loudoun</a></p>

<p>It&#39;s also been claimed that the queen receives all the Intel from various agencies and can do as she pleases with this information with no checks or balances.</p>

<p>She also has full power to go to war. You might say no thats the prime minister and parliament&#39;s decision well no she appoints the prime minister and can suspend parliament at will.</p>

<p>Not to mention she can not be charged with wrong doing and can pardon whomever she pleases.</p>

<p>I ask you whats the difference between a modern day swat team with assault rifles acting under the absolute authority of the crown and the knights in armor of old. Seems that the uk never actually abolished serfdom. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not saying it would stop altogether: it&#39;s not an off switch it&#39;s a bunch of very angry people. But you have to admit this is a huge reason. If America invaded my country under false pretense and started killing my family and installing puppet governments I&#39;d probably become a terrorist too. The reality is that this has been going on for over a century with the British Empire before America and Russia: generally speaking, tending to leave people alone usually helps them fare a lot better than attacking them all the time and not letting to grow.</p>

This attack is atrocious, the worst of the worst - nobody is denying that. The point being made is much more general than this isolated incident - all these attacks across western Europe and the US are, essentially, due to the western world&#39;s &#39;intervention&#39; in these countries and this intervention is down to a small number of factors: greed, power, control &amp; resource. As stated above, if my city was bombed like Baghdad or Kabul or Alleppo or I saw my people being treated like the Yemeni&#39;s or the Palestinians then I would be fucking livid and a bit of retaliation would definitely be on the cards. If this is indeed a &#39;terrorist&#39; (God I hate that word) attack, then I always consider it to be retaliation and I find it a bit insulting and naive for us brits/yanks/europeans to take any form of moral high ground. </p>

<p>Hard to claim moral high ground when nearly half a million iraqi children died during the Gulf war and the US were dropping bombs with depleted uranium in them. </p>

<p>This is not &#39;terrorism&#39;, it&#39;s a fucking war mate. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Again why do think this has anything to do with Iraq,all evident ice so far suggests that this is a home grown attack.</p>

<p>So because US dropped depleted uranium on Iraqi children you think that justifies murdering baby girls at a pop concert in the UK.</p>

<p>This is war you&#39;re right about that and the sooner the people the UK wake up and start to tackle the poisonous ideology that justifies the murder of little girls at a fucking pop concert then the sooner we can begin to purge these types of monsters from our country.</p>

<p>20 miles from Manchester you say.</p>

<p>Well there&#39;s your problem Mancs you have got people living inside you&#39;re community that think this is a justified act of war. Little girls at pop concert blown to bits .Fucking disgusting.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re only looking at one side of the coin mate, I was merely providing examples. You agree it&#39;s a war, Ok - wars have casualties. People will die, other people will make a shit ton of money, other people will profit financially and politically - this is the world we live in. Violence begets violence. I&#39;m not happy about it - I&#39;m a pacifist and a bit if a hippy but I absolutely understand that violence, war and invasion of Middle Eastern (muslim) countries will have repercussions and this is what I believe has happened today. Absolutely heartbreaking but no end in sight until we accept that violence is not the answer. I mean, let&#39;s be honest, our troops aren&#39;t here, there and everywhere to help are they.... </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re twisting his words.</p>

<p>The UK/US have in the past bombed the shit out of communitites in the middle east. Some of those communities had children in them.</p>

<p>So, you&#39;ve got an apathetic young man who sees injustice and murder against &#39;his people&#39;, the news &amp; tv are constantly telling everyone else that he&#39;s the bad guy, and that his people are evil, whilst continuing to bomb &#39;his people&#39;. No-ones talking about these attacks, and murders because they&#39;re brown, foreign and poor.</p>

<p>So how would an ignorant, naive, believer draw attention to their plight? He makes sure you take notice by doing something he sees as equally heinous.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t sympathise with these people, but to claim that there is no reason for this to be happening is incredibly naive....    ..and it&#39;s our governments intervention that catalysed this process.</p>

<p>Collectively we have the blood of children on our hands, just as you&#39;re insinuating that Muslims have blood on their hands, and remember an eye for an eye makes the whole world blind.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not bombs or threat or wars that&#39;ll stop this shit. They&#39;re doing it for us, they&#39;re getting moderate muslims to hate them for us, and as this shit continues, which it will, fewer and fewer people in civilised society will force their children into religious education.</p>

<p>I&#39;m watching it happen right now. I&#39;ve lived amongst Muslims for most of my life. As a racist child in the 80&#39;s,  I hated their families. Who the fuck do they think they are having more than 2 children. Then I looked at white people in my area. Very few had jobs, most had kids and most were on benefits. Here&#39;s me getting mad at people who pay their taxes, provide for their families and work hard to improve their quality of life, while &#39;my people&#39; sit happily in squallor and are fine with not changing it, while receiving handouts and moaning about people who work hard for what they have. So I started to stop hating.</p>

<p>At 11 years or so I made friends with a boy named Omar. I was acepted into his house as one of the family, I was treated like family, with acceptance and kindness. I remember one year walking round to his house on Christmas Day and seeing that he had no presents went home and took him some of my Lego. I couldn&#39;t imagine someone not celebrating christmas, I just thought they were having financial difficulty or something. We were friends for many years, we still are.</p>

<p>His children are waaaaay more moderate than he was. They go to western schools, they live in the western world, they wear western clothing, they&#39;re as British as I am, as an accident of birth they happen to be &#39;muslim&#39; and I will defend them in times of ignorance and hatred.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Racism rears it&#39;s head in many ways. Assuming that my tolerance for others is a weakness is a sign of it. </p>

<p>I judge individuals on their actions, not by the actions of their &#39;peers&#39;.</p>

<p>That Tar-Brush starts to get awfully wide.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not abandoning a good house, a good neighbourhood, a good life because my neighbours are brown. I&#39;m staying here and immersing myself in all the cultures around me to enrich who I am. It&#39;s like travelling without a passport, or money.</p>

<p>To have a healthy outlook on life you need people with opposing views, different cultures and different ideas to challenge you and your own prejudices, if you don&#39;t have that you get Ghetto&#39;s. Ghetto&#39;s breed ignorance racism and crime.</p>

<p>I live in Nottingham pal. Before all this EU/Chinese/Malaysian money came in from the Uni to take the place of the industry we were sending abroad, people were poor. They were also white. This isn&#39;t a self-hating thing, it&#39;s history. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good sir there is no better argument, than a civilised argument. I&#39;ll even tone down on profanities. In Australia it&#39;s always time to drink, it&#39;s also almost dinner. </p>

<p>I think your comment is a broad and hate inducing piece of writing. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>If we just left them alone they would still hate us. There clerics would still preach hatred for the west.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So what if they do? That&#39;s fine they can hate the west til the cows come home, how does their hatred affect us? Do you wake up in the morning thinking &quot;Damn, I feel hated by a group on the other side of the world?&quot; </p>

<p>Some would argue that this hatred could boil over into acts of violence against the western world. I would agree that is a possibility, but at the same time, If they did attack, violent actions again the perpetrators of any attacks on the west would be just but positively righteous. Until then it&#39;s live and let live.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>They hate that we give women equal rights.
They hate because we give gays equal rights.
They hate us because we support Israel.
They hate us because we let 11 year old little girls go to see what they consider to be a slut like Ariana Grande.
They hate us because their holy book preaches bullshit like this.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They hate the west, no doubt, for lots of reasons. But the reasons you listed are narrow minded and immature. They hate the west, (in my opinion) because we ruined their countries for oil. We ousted their democratically elected leaders, put in corrupt politician who were western puppets, killed their men, raped their women, ruined their lives and lively hood and are the sole reason their kids go hungry at night. If you want to go even further back, there was the Crusades, where the west essentially said &quot;Alright you godless heathens, Jerusalem is holy land, <strong>our</strong> holy land, our God is the true god, you&#39;re wrong. Now fuck (I know I said no profanities but it seemed so fitting) off our land and while you&#39;re at it, convert to Christianity accept Jesus as your saviour or prepare to meet Excalibur.&quot; 
To go even further back. Abraham (patriarch of Jews, Christians and Muslims) impregnated a servant girl (Hagar), who bore Ishmael (more on him shortly). Shortly after this his wife Sarah fell pregnant and said (in paraphrasing of course) &quot;I don&#39;t want you loving Ishmael, who is not even ours [he&#39;s yours] more than our kid, get rid of them.&quot; So Abraham sent them out in to the desert. Which was a dick move for numerous reasons. 1 Abraham promised he&#39;d looked after her and 2. The desert sucks, it&#39;s hot, sandy and full of scimitar wielding pricks who are violent to say the least. 
At this point God came down to Hagar and said (again paraphrasing) &quot;I promised Abraham I&#39;d bless you and your child, even though he&#39;s a dick, I&#39;m a man (God) of my word and will bless you and your child and make your people many.&quot; Her son, Ishmael was the founder of the Muslims and after being abandon by his father pissed him right off. </p>

<p>Finally, </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Quran (2:191-193) - &quot;And kill them wherever you find them, and turn them out from where they have turned you out. And Al-Fitnah [disbelief or unrest] is worse than killing
Or this
Quran (2:216) - &quot;Fighting is prescribed for you, and ye dislike it. But it is possible that ye dislike a thing which is good for you, and that ye love a thing which is bad for you.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Isiah 14:21- &quot;Make ready to slaughter the infidel’s sons for the guilt of their fathers; Lest they rise and possess the earth, and fill the breadth of the world with tyrants.&quot;</p>

<p>Ezekiel 9:5-&quot;Then I heard God say to the other men, &quot;Follow him through the city and kill everyone whose forehead is not marked. Show no mercy; have no pity! Kill them all – old and young, girls and women and little children.”&quot;</p>

<p>Both books are &quot;divinely inspired&quot; both book preach violence against all who oppose god&#39;s righteous. Did it ever occur to anyone that maybe this isn&#39;t correct? Religion is the institutionalising of Faith, something that had lead to atrocities since the dawn of civilisation. Not to mention if the story of Abraham and Ishmael are true (which bible, Quran and theological scholars agree is the case) they&#39;re all right? or all wrong?</p>

<p>My point is divisive speech, the propagation or further violence against the east and the tit for tat they bomb us we bomb them mentality is doing no body any good and the way to solve this is by letting bygones be bygones, leaving the east to be easterners and the west westerners and seeing how that goes?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I love people like you when they get beaten in an logical and rational argument, they quickly quote something from Quran to show how evil Muslims are and how its  in their religion to kill non Muslims and no one corrects them because most people in the west know nothing about Quran. But all we have to do is take a look at the context so allow me to quote the verses in full.</p>

<p>(source Quran.com)</p>

<p>Quran (2:190)  SAHIH INTERNATIONAL 
<strong>Fight in the way of Allah those who fight you but do not transgress</strong>. Indeed. Allah does not like transgressors.</p>

<p>Quran (2:191)  SAHIH INTERNATIONAL
And kill them wherever you overtake them and expel them from wherever they have expelled you, and fitnah is worse than killing. <strong>And do not fight them at al-Masjid al- Haram until they fight you there. But if they fight you, then kill them</strong>. Such is the recompense of the disbelievers.</p>

<p>Quran (2:192)  SAHIH INTERNATIONAL
<strong>And if they cease, then indeed, Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.</strong></p>

<p>Quran (2:193)  SAHIH INTERNATIONAL
Fight them until there is no [more] fitnah and [until] worship is [acknowledged to be] for Allah . <strong>But if they cease, then there is to be no aggression except against the oppressors.</strong></p>

<p>You also quoted Quran (2:216) - &quot;Fighting is prescribed for you, and ye dislike it. But it is possible that ye dislike a thing which is good for you, and that ye love a thing which is bad for you.</p>

<p>What you forgot to mention here is that God is not talking to Muslims in general in fact he is talking to Prophet Muhammad about his and his followers being persecuted by the hands of their enemies and how they have to fight to defend themselves sometimes and God is telling him to tell the <strong>Muslims that are there with him</strong>  &quot;you might not like fighting but you have no idea how beneficial it is for you&quot;.All you have to do is to look at the verse before it.</p>

<p>Quran (2:215)They ask you, [O Muhammad], what they should spend. Say, &quot;Whatever you spend of good is [to be] for parents and relatives and orphans and the needy and the traveler. And whatever you do of good - indeed, Allah is Knowing of it.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>So Quran (2:216) is not a general order for Muslims that live today</strong>.</p>

<p>Thanks ,i love people like you too.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>when they get beaten in a logical and rational argument</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This subjective and open to interpretation.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>they quickly quote something from Quran to show how evil Muslims are and how its in their religion to kill non-Muslims</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I didn&#39;t quickly jump to this response i also made several other points about hate preachers, hatred for gays, hatred for Israel etc.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>no one corrects them because most people in the west know nothing about Quran.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Correct people in the west have little interest in the Quran. The only reason i ever have any call to read it is when Islamic barbarians murder innocents on our streets.
This is no bad thing, we have freedom to study and learn whatever interests us in our society, but once again I&#39;m forced to read the verses to explain why these people think it&#39;s justified to murder little girls at an Ariana Grande concert. I see your going to explain it me.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Fight in the way of Allah those who fight you but do not transgress. Indeed. Allah does not like transgressors.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Elaborate, please.</p>

<p>What is fighting in the way of Allah?</p>

<p>I take that to mean fight like Allah , chopping off people&#39;s heads, taking slaves etc</p>

<p>What do you mean by Transgressors?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And kill them wherever you overtake them and expel them from wherever they have expelled you, and fitnah is worse than killing. And do not fight them at al-Masjid al- Haram until they fight you there. But if they fight you, then kill them. Such is the recompense of the disbelievers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Elaborate again, please.</p>

<p>I take this to mean that wherever you overtake disbelievers in the number you should expel them and if they resist you should fight them.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And if they cease, then indeed, Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I take this to mean if they submit only then will they be shown mercy.</p>

<p>I mean dont get me wrong all religions are have their faults but to imply the quaran plays no part in radicalisng terrorist is just ridiculous</p>

<p>I am not a native English speaker but what you took from the verse above is the definition of Ignorance and you are part of the western mentality against Islam that i am talking about.I am not gonna waste my time arguing with you there are many sources online that can help you if you wanna get your answers.Good luck.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually, its part of the Muslim religion that they should feel the pain of their Muslim brothers n sisters. So being born in the UK doesn&#39;t mean the homegrown terrorist has no sympathy for Muslims &#39;back home&#39; (wherever the terrorist is ethnically from, as well as other Muslim countries that share his ideology). This is normally what homegrown terrorists spout out that its because of foreign policy blah blah as to why they&#39;re carrying out retaliation attacks.</p>

<p>Fact is, we&#39;re in this vicious cycle that I honestly can&#39;t see an end to, ever, unless there&#39;s a hard reset like an act of God (if you believe) or a meteorite.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m in the UK, really surprised how &quot;US officials&quot; know more about the incident before UK officials do. US News outlets  reported 20 deaths before the UK did and now UK news sources are quoting US officials as there being a suicide bomber responsible for the attack. Can someone explain this? Also, bombs break glass and carnage. A woman at the scene was quoted as hearing a huge &quot;boom&quot;, but she didn&#39;t mention anything after that. Another &quot;witness&quot; said the explosion threw him back 30feet. Surely he&#39;d have some injuries from the shock wave, if not die. It might just be because information is coming out in a crazy way, but some things already sound strange. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, but IRA has (had?) a whole different agenda than this type of terrorism - but I guess in the end of the day it doesn&#39;t really matter where you detonate a bomb because pictures of dead kids and teens on news weigh more than any territorial debate.</p>

<p>I still don&#39;t think this was a false flag incident purely down to the execution. One single fanatic is far too risky for a planned false flag operation. The more the merrier and less chance of failure. </p>

<p>But I&#39;m not working for a rogue government planning events like that so it&#39;s pure speculation from my part - and I can be wrong because I&#39;ve got nothing to prove my theory, but realistically I think my theory is most likely correct.</p>

<p>How difficult is that to do if you want to claim false flag.</p>

<p>It should be the basis of a false flag argument. Conflicting evidence. Not notions about CIA operations.</p>

<p>You can&#39;t have a debate about a claim without any evidence or conflicting evidence.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When more often than not the largest terror attacks in the west are false flags, such as these times we are living in now, it is logical to be sceptical when hearing yet another attack has happened. Especially when the facts start to not add up. Especially given how the media is known to create entirely false set ups and push false stories and lie continuously, and spin every story. So actually, I think you should look at everything you are presented with, and try and be critical, rather than being stuck in your preconceived bias that ISIS muslims are carrying out these attacks, just because its within your scope of belief and reality. It is good to be sceptical in these times and I would recommend it - you&#39;ll arrive closer to the truth, rather than thinking because we live in a climate in which it COULD happen (as it&#39;s been orchestrated as such over decades) and were being TOLD it happened (by proven liars)  means it definitely happened (of which proof has not been offered yet). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah this happens all the time I&#39;ve been working security on events for many years now and the amount of times venues prioritise getting everyone inside instead of security measures is unreal , at the least they should have walk through metal detectors , even just security guards with metal detector wands would suffice and it won&#39;t jam up the queues too much, I currently work for the MOJ and I search people using walk through detectors handheld detectors and baggage x ray machines on a daily basis and we can get each person through in 20 secon&#39;s or quicker , get them to step through the metal detector if it bleeps do a quick scan with the handheld detector , pinpoint cause , then onto the next person  etc and tell them to have their bags open ready for a quick search or idally have a xray bag scanner either way will help more than they are ding now. They have a team of around 40 or more security staff at the Manchester arena , they have around half of that on the main doors at the beginning of the night , put the metal detectors in place etc and you&#39;ll keep a steady flow.</p>

Manchester is only 70 miles North of Birmingham though, so it&#39;s weird that one is truly Northern and the other isn&#39;t Northern at all. 70 miles is next to nothing in most countries,  I used to commute that one-way in Melbourne.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well there we have it. By now it&#39;s not something we haven&#39;t heard before but it still acts as a constant confirmation of how utterly silly it has all become when somebody apologizes for the terrorist groups committing actual, civilian against civilian murder of young girls at an Ariana Grande concert by arguing that, in fact, it is the fault of western civilization and not the threat of Islam to it. </p>

<p>But okay, in the interest of showing you just how silly your implication is let us look at other times when the United States and it&#39;s allies have committed crimes of war and crimes against humanity.  One of these times was when they trained, armed and funded the Indonesian armed forces in order to conquer the republic of East Timor which led to a genocide more effective than that of the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia in that it killed over a third of the native population, using American guns and bombs.</p>

<p>Now when you look at the al-qaeada manifesto you will see, about third item down, that America and it&#39;s imperialist allies must be destroyed because it reversed it&#39;s support in East Timor. A charge was put against ALL of us because we come from a place that stopped the genocide and catalyzed East Timor&#39;s independence, effectively taking away a nation from the Islamic State, even though the vast majority of people in East Timor are Christians. So for this we can never be forgiven and it was for this that they blew up the UN office in Iraq with a quantity of explosives so large it could only have come from Iraqi military sympathetic to the Ba&#39;ath party.  This is why Australian tourists had to lose their lives in Bali. </p>

<p>So make sure you don&#39;t upset the muslims, don&#39;t for instance tell them that they can&#39;t throw acid in the faces of unveiled women in Karachi, because that upsets them.  Don&#39;t, for heavens sake satire the prophet and God help you should you draw a cartoon of him! You would just be bringing it on to yourself at that point /s.</p>

<p>Just let me have one human right please. Don&#39;t include me in your surrender and capitulation of our culture because you were willing to make these comprimises, because I&#39;m not doing it, I am going to fight the theocrats. </p>

A big vote just around the corner, a lot of English uncertainty, early reports of extra post-Trump innocents getting bombed, general increase of military pressure.

<p>That foiled plot in Germany is fresh on my mind as well. I hope this isn&#39;t an echo, but hope tends to seem pointless when this happens. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>As polls begun to show a steady decline in conservative support, a terrorist attack that will now catapult them through the finish line has occurred. I&#39;m not saying this was an inside job, but it was remarkable timed for such a cow bag that Theresa May is. She&#39;s basically guaranteed the election on a silver platter.</p>

<p>The next government will pave the way to more intrusive laws, the retraction of liberty and freedom and the total conquering of the working class. Very sad times ahead. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You think terrorist groups don&#39;t know this and use this to their advantage? Isis supports conservative, anti-refugee/immigrant parties in Europe and the US/Canada because that bolsters their cause. They want, above all else, for all Muslims (especially those in the West) to feel rejected and offended by the West, so that they only feel accepted by radical groups. No better way to do that then commit terrorist acts at strategic times that help parties spewing anti-Muslim or anti-immigrant rhetoric.</p>

<p>Conservative groups didn&#39;t have to be behind this terrorist attack. Isis and Conservatives have the same goal in this election. Whatever helps one helps the other, at least until election day.</p>

Funny also how an overwhelming majority of these refugees are male. It seems that there is a definite agenda behind this continued program of allowing the flood of illegal aliens and refugees. Maybe to change the face of European nations and the United States? Maybe in a deluded belief that if people are mingled in a quicker time-frame, that racism and nationalism will cease to be?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree. The way I see it is that both primary candidates are terrible leaders, the most frightening thing I found was Corbyn&#39;s views on the military and our nuclear weapons , he has openly stated he wants to downsize our military and get rid , yes &#39;get rid&#39; , of our nuclear weapons.

    <div class="md"><p>You can&#39;t change the system from within the framework of the existing system, so if you don&#39;t feel strongly for any candidate, don&#39;t vote, but again, don&#39;t vote if you don&#39;t believe in this system (just spoil your vote).</p>

<p>I am all for a progression towards a green, clean, and free society. I don&#39;t want classes/money, I don&#39;t want wars/violence, etc. I would like for us to be working towards a resource-based economy with clean energy where education is the main focus and we have everything we need as a basic human right.</p>

<p>It boils down to, do I agree with a few people that were/are &#39;conniving&#39; and &#39;clever&#39; enough that they are now on-top of the economic charts, and want to stay there, or, am I for every-man, where I want the best opportunities for all people to make the best of themselves and their time on earth?</p>

<p>To me, it&#39;s a no brainer who to vote for. The minutia of the policies don&#39;t concern me as much as the ethos of the manifestos. There is a bigger picture to consider and bring into focus, and I&#39;d rather look at that, than where I think May will take us.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, I fear we&#39;ll get a little off-topic and meta if we continue talking like this, and before that happens, I agree with your sentiment in that politicians are corrupt/two faced. It&#39;s prevented me from voting in any other election <strong>to date</strong> for that very reason. I&#39;m early 30&#39;s by the way, and have been continually and massively disillusioned with what I&#39;ve seen in politics from my earliest memories (earliest being John Major as a kid).</p>

<p>To preface the next statement, I must say something I&#39;ve only just quite recently solidified into my understanding (of myself and others), which is the human condition and &quot;reason for being/living/existing/take-your-pick&quot;. Human beings, being animals, seek some form of hierarchy, and generally certain types of people <em>want</em> to attain a position of power and comfort above the others. Reasons can be from personal desire, to wanting to have the power to help others etc. </p>

<p>Given that we&#39;re here for such a short amount of time (&lt;100 years) what people do to have this time be as comfortable as possible makes sense. By that, I mean things like back-stabbing, back-handers, etc. Let&#39;s not be coy, as the royalty of old would have been the victors <strong>of</strong> these types of people; people do extraordinary things in order to elevate themselves above others <em>to make their status higher and more comfortable</em>.</p>

<p>So, when I see people (like May) behave as she does, and make decisions for <strong>who</strong> she does, I feel I <em>understand it</em>. That being said my understanding of it does not validate it as being a &quot;good reason&quot; so-to-speak, and by that I do not say she is &#39;evil&#39; for it. Whilst I understand that people, in-general, want the best for themselves and their offspring, and that keeping people below them would essentially benefit their standing (longevity in the position at least), I cannot abide by this notion if it divides humanity into a class system, or one that gives labels to make us feel separate or uncommon to one-another. I feel we should view humanity as a whole and feel empathy and have understanding for each other, and holding onto one&#39;s &quot;way of life&quot; or status/standing does nothing at all to help my ideals.</p>

<p>So, in summary, I&#39;ll be voting Labour, because I don&#39;t care about things like borders (who decided humans can&#39;t go anywhere they want on Earth?), and things like warfare (I don&#39;t want anyone killed for my own protection), and things like green energy (I don&#39;t want what is left of the Earth to be painful for those left).</p>

<p>To speak as succinctly as possible, May cares only for herself and her life, and keeping those that help her achieve it where they are. She is a selfish person that likely knows no better (and I do not pass judgement on her to say this is evil; it&#39;s understandable). Corbyn&#39;s history in politics is studded with his belief that we should discuss, understand and talk things through, with minimal violence to elevate the future generations to higher positions/knowledge etc. and to ultimately (although I might be putting words in his mouth) make <em>humanity</em> better, by investment into the future. May wants as much as she can get for her and her little tribe, for as long as they can, whilst Corbyn is the one saying &quot;there can be a way for all of us to have what we need; let us find a way&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you very much for this! I&#39;m mid 30&#39;s myself so everything you have just said resonates well with me and I whole heartedly agree with everything you&#39;ve mentioned. I agree with your sentiment on May - although somewhat understandable her policy is to divide and conquer which does seem to be the opposite view to that of Corbyn&#39;s beliefs. I was going to vote Labour but then my mind swayed and I believe he will be manipulated by those on the next level up to do what is best for them rather than for the people. However you raise a good point for me: I might as well vote for Labour rather than void my ballot paper to at least attempt to ensure that the lesser of 2 possible evils gets pushed through rather than the devil (May) herself. Thanks very much once again as you&#39;ve helped me rationalise my decision!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This attack does several things. It will negative a surge in the polls which Labour have been seeing this last week. The media will take this as an opportunity to attack Corbyn for being soft and May will undoubtedly use the leverage of increased security for political capital. Andy Burnam&#39;s profile will increase and he&#39;ll most likely take over as a more acceptable leader of the Labour party after the election.</p>

<p>The CIA have form in the UK for interfering with election cycles setting the media narrative and political character assassination. Wikileaks leaks some time ago revealed they had a couple members of parliament within the Labour party who were feeding them information at the last election. </p>

<p>I also find the timing of it very suspicious not only in regard to the general election itself but also relating to Trump moving forward the schedule of his overseas trip. Being in Israel a day ahead of time is too good to be true. </p>

<p>I hate saying it because it&#39;s said a lot and in many cases spuriously but if you&#39;re looking a for a false flag event this one checks a lot of those boxes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you all see this as a distraction from American issues. But I think it&#39;s entirely to win the election for the Tories. The opposition is considered soft, whilst May is considered the war queen or something of the two, so to push this out there and ask Corbyn what he would do is setting him up to fail. He is constantly put into hypothetical wars and refuses to say he&#39;d send troops without knowing the full story (as he should), yet is called weak for this.
The election is in a month. This is perfectly timed. The tories will win. They will increase security. We will suffer</p>

It&#39;s just enough people actually have to be bothered about the subject then it&#39;ll work! you can&#39;t just moan at home, then complain nothing&#39;s being changed lol also petitions are also another good way. That&#39;s just to name a couple. So there are plenty of ways it&#39;s just whether you can be bothered or not!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You think terrorist groups don&#39;t know this and use this to their advantage? Isis supports conservative, anti-refugee/immigrant parties in Europe and the US/Canada because that bolsters their cause. They want, above all else, for all Muslims (especially those in the West) to feel rejected and offended by the West, so that they only feel accepted by radical groups. No better way to do that then commit terrorist acts at strategic times that help parties spewing anti-Muslim or anti-immigrant rhetoric.</p>

<p>Conservative groups didn&#39;t have to be behind this terrorist attack. Isis and Conservatives have the same goal in this election. Whatever helps one helps the other, at least until election day.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, but IRA has (had?) a whole different agenda than this type of terrorism - but I guess in the end of the day it doesn&#39;t really matter where you detonate a bomb because pictures of dead kids and teens on news weigh more than any territorial debate.</p>

<p>I still don&#39;t think this was a false flag incident purely down to the execution. One single fanatic is far too risky for a planned false flag operation. The more the merrier and less chance of failure. </p>

<p>But I&#39;m not working for a rogue government planning events like that so it&#39;s pure speculation from my part - and I can be wrong because I&#39;ve got nothing to prove my theory, but realistically I think my theory is most likely correct.</p>

<p>How difficult is that to do if you want to claim false flag.</p>

<p>It should be the basis of a false flag argument. Conflicting evidence. Not notions about CIA operations.</p>

<p>You can&#39;t have a debate about a claim without any evidence or conflicting evidence.</p>
