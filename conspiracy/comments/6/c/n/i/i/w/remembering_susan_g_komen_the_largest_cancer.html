    <div class="md"><p>The think-tanks are influencing the governments, not the other way around.</p>

<p>Club of Rome is one example of such an think-tank.</p>

<p>All this environmentalism garbage is coming from such organizations: carbon emission tax, global warming, polar caps smelting, ozone(ass)hole getting bigger, take a pick it&#39;s all fake anyway.</p>

<p>Fun fact: The same algorithm which predicts global warming is used to predict US. unemployment. Hillarious. </p>

<p>OP is correct, almost all charities are total scam.
You give money/currency to an organization which faces you&#39;ve never seen, to support people/animals you will never see.</p>

<p>The only sensible solution is to use your money to help your own community locally.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t even get started on the frauds of UNICEF, or W. Gates III vaccine mass murder.</p>

<p>How would you define a &quot;cure&quot; for cancer ?</p>

<p>It can be removed by surgical operation or the cancer cells killed by therapy.</p>

<p>Once you have cancer, it can&#39;t really be &quot;cured&quot;, like having lost and arm or an leg can&#39;t be &quot;cured&quot;, only removed to prevent further damage to the body.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Profit drives human action and innovation. There&#39;s millions of people right now trying to figure out how to solve people&#39;s problems so they can profit. People go to work for profit. Profit is not bad. Do you ever visit a grocery store? Do you know every moving part required to get your food on that shelf? Do you know that profit is the grease on every single piece of that moving part? Do you think Safeway would offer a better product or service if people were all forced to pay them 500 a month? Why do you think it&#39;s any different with any other product or service?</p>

<p>How in the hell can you say government isn&#39;t profit driven? What do you think taxes are? Congress votes themselves pay raises. Government unions strike and lobby for ridiculous salaries and benefits. Civil asset forfeiture, private prison contracts, military industrial complex, the drug war, probation funds, politicians being bribed, fines for victimless crimes, lawyers making more laws...... I could sit here and type for hours on all the ways that government extracts profits by force from its subjects. Why do you think people spend millions and billions on campaigns? FOR FUCKING PROFIT! What do you call congressmen leaving office as millionaires. Look up the net worth of the government power brokers. Look up government employees raking in 500k a year in salary and benefits.</p>

<p>Why do people, especially in this sub, have such a hard time seeing the difference in what government is supposed to be doing, in contrast with what they actually do? Yes, government is supposed to be there to protect liberty and serve the people. I understand that is the theory. In practice government is a monopoly that steals money (profit) from people.</p>

<p>I get that the brainwashing is thick. But how can you not see all these fat cats are just concentrating wealth (profit) through violence? How can you not see that government is just a giant business that operates to gain more power and money for itself? Every time government taxes and increase taxes they are profiting. Every time they pass another law they are profiting. Every time they force us to buy services (obamacare) they are doing it for profit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure, it is an interesting idea. In my understanding, the tumors are growths that arise due to a specific type of crisis or conflict within the mind. For example, if there is a fear of death, then there may be an increase in tissue within the lungs as a way of absorbing more oxygen into the body. If the conflict is not resolved, then the growth will continue until the patient dies. If the conflict is resolved then the extra tissue will be eliminated by the body. There are different types of conflicts that result in different types of cancer.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Holistic&quot; just means whole body. Keep your body clean and healthy, and cancer won&#39;t be an issue.</p>

<p>Cancer is simply your body stuffing away acid the best it can when you&#39;ve overloaded the eliminative system, largely with acid-forming foods (meat, dairy, grains, processed crap). Eliminate the acid-forming foods (and other inputs), replace them with alkaline-forming fruits and vegetables that we&#39;re meant to be eating, and work on the elimination (light-mid exercise, various herbals). Even better, you can follow this regimen to stay healthy to begin with.</p>

<p>Shit&#39;s not complicated -- they&#39;ve just got a massive PR army, including Susan G Komen&#39;s crew, deployed to convince that the cure for cancer is a big crazy futuristic goal.</p>

<p>You&#39;re lumping together some very different things.</p>

<p>Here are some general guidelines for eating alkaline:</p>

<p>Focus on eating whole foods, like vegetables, root crops, fruits, nuts, seeds, spices, <strong>whole grains</strong> and beans (especially lentils).</p>

<p>And, of course, if a medical doctor dares to stray from the chemo/radiation/surgery doctrine, they&#39;ll lose their license. Keeps a lot of mouths shut.</p>

<p>Eating healthy is the <em>only</em> thing that can cure cancer. Also not eating (calorie restriction/fasting) can play a big role.</p>

<p>Coffee (in moderation) has numerous health benefits, as the informed people do know.</p>

<p>Heroin is something that doctors prescribe in some cases. So obviously they think it does some good.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>they have 78 beds total.<br/>
But only <strong>30</strong> of those beds are for overnight patients ( ie full time cancer patients) 
For a hospital that advertises itself as being the premiere hospital for pediatric cancer treatment... that&#39;s pretty shameful. </p>

<p>HIPAA laws won&#39;t allow it to be said , but of those 30 patients - about 4 of them are not covered by a mainstream insurance too. </p>

<p>For reference. BOSTON&#39;s Children&#39;s Hospital :  400+ for overnight  for reference. 
Children&#39;s Hospital Philadelphia : 500+ overnight beds. 
Seattle Childrens : 375+ overnight. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure but I&#39;m talking about how they fundraise (which is the topic of this post) </p>

<p>A lot of their advertisements make it seem like they are a cancer only hospital and the finest in the country.   I know for a fact that they pay their celebrities to do PSAs for them.   </p>

<p>There&#39;s also the fact that they overshadow that it&#39;s a hospital in Memphis.  I think some people assume that they are everywhere.</p>
