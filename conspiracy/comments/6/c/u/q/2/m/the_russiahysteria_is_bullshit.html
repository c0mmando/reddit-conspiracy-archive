        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>If you believe &quot;Russia-hacked-the-election&quot; <del>you are an idiot</del> I believe you are being propagandized. Not sure if there is genuine debate in this sub about that or if it has just been inundated with shills (most likely the latter). </p>

<p>The entire premise of the Russia-hysteria is that they &quot;hacked&quot; the DNC/Podesta and gave the emails to Wikileaks. There has been no evidence presented from the Intelligence Community to support this claim. ZERO. This is the same Intelligence Community that sold us the Gulf of Tonkin Affair, the Nayirah Testimony, the claim of WMDs. If Russia did not &quot;hack&quot; the DNC then all you got is Trump and company having favorable positions/associations towards Russia. These associations may be sketchy, and corrupt but they do not warrant the level of increasing hysteria we have seen from the MSM. </p>

<p>In my opinion this is a media/deep state campaign to impeach Trump, to feed the military-industrial complex and manufacture consent for further escalation with Russia directly/through proxy wars like Syria, and to divert attention away from the corruption of the DNC.</p>

<p>There are many more points to be made but I will stick to the simple fact that there has been no evidence produced that proves Russia &quot;hacked&quot; the DNC.</p>

<p>I will most likely be accused of being a shill for Russia or Trump. I support neither of them. I read primarily from independent progressive publications and they have been providing some very sane analysis of this hysteria. If you want to do some further reading on this topic/have links to red-pill your friends and family:</p>

<p>EDIT: Apologies on calling people idiots. Not the best way to lead off. Also the picture put above this post is from an article warning of the danger of a Mike Pence presidency. Not sure how it got included but it makes this post look pro-Trump which I am not. In my opinion this new red scare is one of the most obvious and massive propaganda campaigns I&#39;ve ever seen. Im not debating the fact that Trump has shady connections with Russia and is advancing policies favorable to them, all I&#39;m saying is no evidence for the hacking of the DNC has been presented, which, in my opinion, forms the backbone of the media frenzy. There is a pattern of the US Intelligence Community saying they have information that will alter US foreign policy and then not presenting any. It&#39;s important to call bullshit and demand proof given their track record. I personally dislike Trump and frankly the whole US Govt/power structure. I think the hysterical nature of the media coverage around this issue is bullshit.</p>

<p>EDIT 2: Toning down the inflammatory opening. Definitely pissed some people off.</p>

<p>EDIT 3: <strong>This is not a post that is meant to support Trump in any way.</strong> I think he is a puppet. I am just pointing to some of the media/government propaganda and trying to remind everyone that there is no proof that we have seen.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are missing my point. If Russia didn&#39;t hack the election then Mike Flynn&#39;s actions don&#39;t fit into some grand conspiracy of Russia infiltrating our democracy. He did something </p>

<p>Flynn got caught promising a lifting of sanctions to the Russian ambassador. Flynn once had a paid speaking gig a dinner for RT and has appeared on the network. So what? If you wanna talk about US diplomats having favorable positions towards foreign countries why not talk about Saudi Arabia or Israel?</p>

<p>So what?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well he seemingly lied about it to several folks in the government, as well as Trump&#39;s Admin hiring him against all advice.</p>

<p>Plus, Flynn isn&#39;t the only connection. I just don&#39;t feel like rehashing info that is widely available on this sub already.</p>

<p>Look, I don&#39;t think Trump himself colluded with Russia. But it seems plausible to likely that he was a Manchurian Candidate who was helped by foreign interests. What leads me to consider this is the numerous hidden connections that high profile campaign or Admin staff had with foreign interests. Some of those folks seemingly lied under oath (like Flynn) and others have direct connections to Putin or his henchmen. </p>

<p>So again, it seem plausible that the Russians tried to infiltrate the Trump campaign without his knowledge, then tried to influence the election so that those assets became valuable due to blackmail or carelessness. Seems much easier to do with an inexperienced leader whose ego seems to be as big as the Sun.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well you&#39;ve also got the Podesta emails. Roger Stone needs to explain how he knew Podesta&#39;s emails were going to be released months before they actually were.</p>

<p>The whole crux of the issue is Russia helped Trump and then Trump would help Russia. A Quid pro quo relationship. So Trump appoints a shit ton of pro Russia people to his administration. </p>

<p>The only change to the party platform from the Trump campaign was to oppose arming Ukraine rebels against Russia.</p>

<p>Flynn then did get caught promising to lift sanctions. Flynn also did appear at a dinner for RT and THEN LIED ABOUT ON OFFICIAL GOVERNMENT FORMS. This is why Flynn isn&#39;t cooperating. Providing false or concealing information on a SF-86 is <a href="https://news.clearancejobs.com/2014/01/11/happens-provide-false-information-security-clearance-investigation/">a felony</a>. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>A decade ago Manafort made upwards of 10 billion dollars working for Russian Oligarch Oleg Deripaska. Manafort also helped elect Yankunavich, the now-ousted president of Ukraine, who has the backing of Putin’s Russia, probably violating US lobbying laws in the process. There is no doubt that Paul Manafort is a sketchy, immoral, individual. He was probably working to push Trump toward better relations with Russia. But again. So what? </p>

<p>In what way does having people close to you with ties to Russia, constitute evidence that you helped hack the DNC and leaked emails to Wikileaks? It doesn’t.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with that. If you have followed the media&#39;s narrative arc that is not the story they&#39;re telling. If you have been listening to Rachael Maddow lately you have seen the reincarnation of Glenn Beck.

    <div class="md"><p>Haven&#39;t been watching Maddow.  What I really wonder is if Trump has ties to the Russian mob.  How the hell did he manage to put together a group - starting with his campaign - that is so strongly pro-Russia?  I think it&#39;s possible the Russians were behind the DNC hack, but that really isn&#39;t my main concern.  Even if that did happen, I think Trump would have been unaware (this is all speculation).  And I say that as someone that is strongly anti-Trump.</p>

<p>Come on bro, the CIA&#39;s and FBI have lied about 100s of things for 50+ years, but lets be real here. Why would the entire IC, unanimously agree, that Russians influenced the 2016 election if they didn&#39;t. What would 17 independent agencies have to gain by manufacturing 1000s of fake documents and spending 100s of hours testifying before congress..?</p>

<p>As far as I can tell there are three reasons for denying Russias interference:</p>

<ol>
<li>You&#39;re Russian</li>
<li>You&#39;re die hard Trump support and do not care about evidence.</li>
<li>You&#39;re so unbelievably brainwashed you cannot see the reality of the situation.</li>

<p>I can buy that you can be skeptical of the evidence that Russia hacked the DNC, particularly now with astroturfing and <em>disinformatziya</em> bubbling up about Seth Rich. That&#39;s not the same as your title though. <em>Trump-Russia &quot;hysteria&quot;</em> as you call it is far far far more than that; that&#39;s what parent is trying to discuss with you. It&#39;s a classic case of having 1 piece of evidence supporting your pet theory, 99 pieces of evidence against your theory and you clinging on to that 1 piece of evidence.</p>

<p>Maybe in the media, but there was a lot more going on behind the scenes with the CIA and the FBI. Watch the Brennan hearing today to find out more information about that (just skip past Gowdy&#39;s partisan line of finding about leaks when we know the subject matter is Trump-Russia to save some time).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>All I&#39;m asking for is definitive evidence.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s the problem. You don&#39;t get to see that evidence. Try to get yourself on a grand jury or something. Or become a congressman in the right committee. 4chan screenshots are not evidence. Emails dumped out of context are not evidence. There are standards people adhere to and policies people follow. You&#39;re not going to get a smoking gun, at least not yet. I&#39;ll freely admit there might never be evidence, or if there were, it might be long shredded (remember, Ollie &quot;my memory&#39;s shredded&quot; North? and how there was &quot;no evidence&quot; that Reagan knew and ordered Iran-Contra). The bottomline is that with the enormous power of the executive, the FBI should make its moves carefully. When you&#39;re coming at the King, you best not miss is a good saying. Expect to see less or even none. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s you again. What a shocker.</p>

<p>I&#39;m saying, as objectively as I can, that they&#39;re not playing their cards right.</p>

<p>If I&#39;m a deep state member that wants Trump gone, my priorities shouldn&#39;t be creating negative Trump PR and investigating ties that are not conclusive. I&#39;d rather bide my time and catch him slipping. We all know that it&#39;s possible. Nobody is perfect. Considering all the means the CIA has at their disposal, these &quot;anonymous sources&quot; articles are an embarrassment and just lead more to roll their eyes. I&#39;d much rather let the Russia narrative fizz out while pursuing better leads. Lean on tax returns not being out. What&#39;s this about Ivanka? Why&#39;d you make a deal with Saudi Arabians when you&#39;re so against Muslims?</p>

<p>Let the msm do their job of nitcking - they have already been working on that, but tell then to quit on the anonymous sources leaking horseshit. People got desensitized by now. It&#39;s been nati Trump 24/7. Instead if the pull back and be more forgiving on Trump while I gather evidence, we can do a bombshell release article in about two months, where the public will be more receptive to the scandal and Trump&#39;s own PR will have a harder time to respond to something. They wouldn&#39;t be able to blame the constant msm bias since there won&#39;t be enough of it to deflect to.</p>

<p>More than anything, the past half a year revealed that TPTB are incredibly out of touch with their PR narratives and are not understanding of how to utilize the internet and to push narratives. They need to hire some new blood and let the shills take a breather.</p>

<p>This is absolutely it for me. This is why you could sell me on something like a few people with foreknowledge of 9/11 allowing it to happen vs controlled demolition carried out by the government.

    <div class="md"><p>the reason is quite simple, no one expected trump to win really. He is now in a place where he can interfere with their plans however passively. 
Intelligence community as any kind of power/political block runs on money and influence. Both of which are now in unstable position since Trump is clearly not impressed with the intelligence community and is focused more on &quot;looking inward&quot; policy which means less money flow to all those expensive intelligence gathering missions outside of US. </p>

<p>So, the reason is as always simple, money. It&#39;s always the money. Directly or indirectly when someone poses a threat to the money the  US goes to war, cold, hot or something in between. The evidence is plentiful. </p>

<p>As for Trump, he might have ties to Russia. But insisting that it was russian &quot;hacking&quot; that put him in power is quite frankly a copout. US citizens voted for him because the idea of change, of any change was  better than another 4/8 years with the &quot;business as always&quot; Clinton. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think anyone really is on the emails. I&#39;m not I don&#39;t care about that. I do think there is collusion for money laundering, blackmail, and or Trump doing shit for money though. If you are ignoring the fact that every single one of his advisors has had extensive ties to Russia, and the Russian mob, and that the fucking National Security Advisor had to resign and all the connections such as page, Manafort, Sessions, etc all had some type of connection that they lied about (sessions under fucking oath) then that&#39;s on you for ignoring this shit. I would think it&#39;s made up too? But no way alll these connections are just coincidences. No way I believe there is nothing there. Maybe Trump was too dumb to know some things were illegal, I can believe that. But the story does have teeth if you actually read through all the connections and literal millions of dollars exchanged from Russia and Trump&#39;s team for the last few years. </p>

<p>Like if they are innocent, why are they lying so much? And obstructing justice? Seriously imagine if Clinton was president and fired Comey for investigating her and asked multiple FBI agents to drop it. </p>

<p>Try something. This is what got me to see it. <em>Replace Trumps name with Clinton, and all of his aides names with Clinton aids names including his kids and shit</em> if you would still defend all the connections after that then fine. I just could not with a clear conscience say it&#39;s nothing there. We all want more evidence but it&#39;s probably the most high profile investigation right now, and while leaks are coming, they don&#39;t want to tip off who they are investigating and may still be gathering info. Just read through all the connections and money. It takes a while but dude I have no clue how you all say it&#39;s nothing there unless you actually never read through all of the connections and money and lies they told. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Whooops, you came back to that again. Like the person above who started this thread (<a href="/u/chornu">/u/chornu</a>), my main issue with your post is this sentence:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The entire premise of the Russia-hysteria is that they &quot;hacked&quot; the DNC/Podesta and gave the emails to Wikileaks</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sure the significance of the Seth Rich angle relies on this viewpoint, but I just don&#39;t think this viewpoint is true. The potential malfeasance is <em>not</em> simply based on this DNC email hack-- the merits of digging deeper into Trump/Russia connections still exist even if Hillary personally pulled the trigger herself and took out Rich for sending leaks directly to Assange.</p>

<p>You actually correctly addressed the commenter on this claim at first, when he essentially said there appear to be dozens of other Russia ties, and you respond that those potential other ties don&#39;t amount to interference in the election. But the fact is that you don&#39;t <em>know</em> that.... I don&#39;t know that, nobody knows that (in the negative) yet.</p>

<p>Frankly I don&#39;t want Trump to be impeached. I feel like his presidency is already &quot;lame duck&quot; and I&#39;d rather we brave through it than have Pence or Ryan in charge.</p>

<p>But I believe there are people in various positions in the security agencies and in Trump&#39;s former or current entourage who have important information that needs to see the light of day still. It ain&#39;t over.</p>

<p>But I&#39;m getting a little tired of the delay. Out with it, folks. Sure premature revelations can harm an investigation, but there is also harm in all the finger-pointing with no proof. Show me.</p>

<p>But, while I wait for this proof, yeah it&#39;s totally valid for the media to cover what we&#39;ve got hints of so far....</p>

<p>Clinton was a bad candidate because she had been smeared for the last 20 years. The benghazi commissions (After the first couple) were only set up to try to make her look bad. They artificially created a ton of &#39;baggage&#39; that would hurt her chances.</p>

<p>So problem 1: She had a ton of perceived baggage, real or not. </p>

<p>Problem 2: Bill signed NAFTA. Old folks in the midwest blame all of their problems on it. It should have been a red flag when bernie won Michigan in the primaries. MI has a very republican state government - people didn&#39;t go out and vote bernie because he was a super liberal person, because they don&#39;t vote that way at the state level (some of us did, but not enough for him to win). When Bernie lost CA (And sealed the nomination) I said she better start campaigning down south and hope to flip some of the red southern states, because she won&#39;t win the midwest. And she didn&#39;t.</p>

<p>Problem 3: Massive propaganda machine <em>mostly powered by russian botnets</em> <strong>she&#39;s fainting! She&#39;s weak! She eats children!</strong></p>

<p>Problem 4: Email leaks, astroturfing by people pretending to be Bernie Supporters, the rest of the shitshow of complaints people had about the DNC, the electoral college skewing to favor lower population states</p>

<p>The simple fact is #1 and #2 alone made it a difficult race for her to win, everything else made it almost impossible. Even so, that doesn&#39;t make it OK for a foreign government to have manipulated our election <em>even if it didn&#39;t matter</em>. Trump needs to stop trying to stop the investigation that is around the election meddling (And the people he brought on who were compromised), <em>before</em> he gets hit with obstruction of justice (if it&#39;s not too late). The quicker the report is out and concluded, the quicker we can <em>try</em> to prevent our country from falling apart.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t have evidence of who leaked the emails, so I&#39;m not going to place blame on that. The emails themselves didn&#39;t cost the democrats the election, and I still feel like they didn&#39;t really have that much of an effect. The government keeps telling us we don&#39;t need to be worried about privacy if we have nothing to hide, I treat them the same. The emails basically confirmed the DNC was doing some of the shady shit that some of us suspected, but I don&#39;t think it did much more damage than the &#39;spirit cooking&#39; BS or the &#39;Grab them by the pussy&#39; comments from Trump did to steer away the evangelicals.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>when the republicans did it,</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The republicans explicitly wanted a chaotic transfer of power? The Russian end goal was not to get Trump elected. It was to sew chaos for Clinton and get the country to distrust her when she won the presidency. The fact that Trump won was due to the pure gullibility of people. That&#39;s why Putin finds it all so funny, because he literally has no connections with Trump, just the people in his inner circle.</p>

<p>The Wikileaks emails from the DNC and Podesta (IMO obviously) were the absolute nail in Hillary&#39;s coffin. At the very least, it split the democratic party into the hillary camp, and the bernie camp, and the Berners despised Hillary so much after learning what the DNC did to their candidate, that they chose not to vote than to vote for her.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>For the sake of argument, lets go:</p>

<p>1&amp;2: &quot;We&#39;re going to spend money and do this&quot; Did they? Or did they just take the money. Again, this is not evidence of anything actually happening, just them saying they plan on doing it. </p>

<ol>
<li><p>&quot;We&#39;re going to spend money and do this&quot;, exact same explanation, they have funding and said what they want to use it for. </p></li>
<li><p>Again, just says they exist (and offered to buy leaks on Trump), not anything they did.</p></li>
<li><p>FTA:</p></li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
<p>Unlike other independent-expenditure only super PACs, which are prohibited by the Federal Election Commission from coordinating with campaigns or political parties, Correct the Record plans to work closely with the Clinton campaign. That’s because, the group says, it does not plan to spend money to run ads. Instead, the PAC intends to use its website and social media platforms to counter claims made about Clinton.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That <em>does</em> put them in my shady bucket, but again, doesn&#39;t actually show anything they did. </p>

<ol>
<li>This is literally the same as the first / second article.</li>
</ol>

<p>So again, they existed, had money, and may or may not have ever done anything with it as soon as it was public there was a massive backlash and witch-hunt that every person who said anything against trump was a shill for them. </p>

<p>I would be that due to the backlash they never actually did <em>anything</em>, and that funding was eaten. That funding BTW was a <em>fraction</em> of the amount Republicans put into Cambridge Analytica. (Which doesn&#39;t have any &#39;evidence&#39; they actually did anything either, which is why I can&#39;t blame them for the propaganda <em>they</em> may have spread)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Can&#39;t really argue with you there. I agree, none of that is definitive proof that they actively did that. But I&#39;m curious, what you would consider proof of them actually doing what they said they were going to do?</p>

<p>Anecdotally, as a long-time subscriber to this sub, I can say with near 99.99% certainty that CTR was very much active here (and many places elsewhere on the internet) during the election, doing the exact things that they claimed to have done. The level of manipulation they thought they could get away with under the radar was astonishing. </p>

<p>I believe this is what led to the rise in the level of shilling that can be seen now from the other side. T_D undoubtedly uses similar tactics, but they are simply using the playbook that CTR laid out for them. </p>

<p>Granted, I have nothing you would consider definitive proof for this besides personal experience. But all I was trying to say in the first place was that both sides play these kinds of games. To suggest that only one side engages in trying to control the public narrative online is not only foolish, it&#39;s unrealistic.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The only group to have examined the DNC’s server is Crowdstrike, a cyber-security group connected to both the DNC and the Atlantic Council, a pro-Nato anti-Russia/Iran think tank.</p>

<p>They allege that the attacker must have been Russian because there were comments in the code in Cyrillic, a conclusion (as Security Researcher Robert Parr has pointed out) as ridiculous as saying <a href="https://medium.com/@jeffreycarr/the-dnc-breach-and-the-hijacking-of-common-sense-20e89dacfc2b">a murder done with a Kalishnikov must have been committed by a Russian.</a></p>

<p>Crowdstrike’s conclusion (and the conclusions of other, private, security firms) that the hacking group FancyBear, or APT28, works for the Russian government is based on a 2014 report by the security firm FireEye, which baldly states that they “are not profiling all of APT28’s targets with the same detail because they are not particularly indicative of a specific sponsor’s interests.”</p>

<p>Which is to say that they only considered information on APT28 that suggested it worked for the Kremlin in their report on whether or not APT28 worked for the Kremlin.</p>

<p>The reports released by the intelligence community claiming confidence it was the Russians, are a joke.</p>

<p><a href="https://consortiumnews.com/2017/01/07/us-report-still-lacks-proof-on-russia-hack/">They consist of a list of reasons why Russia might want to influence the election, but no actual proof they did.</a> Which is probably why they’re qualified with the line: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/01/06/us/politics/document-russia-hacking-report-intelligence-agencies.html?_r=0">“Judgments are not intended to imply that we have proof that shows something to be a fact.

<p>Interview with Eric Chien, a cybersecurity specialist at Symantec.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The binaries that were used to hack the DNC as well as Podesta’s email as well as some other Democratic campaign folks, those IOCs match binaries and also infrastructure that was used in attacks that were previously recorded by others as having Russian origin. That much we can confirm.</p>

<p>So if you believe other people’s—primarily government’s—attribution that those previous attacks were Russian, then these attacks are definitely connected. We’re talking about the same binaries, the same tools, the same infrastructure. </p>

<p>We’ve analyzed the tools, the binaries, and the infrastructure that was used in the attack, and from that we can confirm that it’s connected to a group that has two names. One is Sofacy, or “Cozy Bear,” and The Dukes, which is also known as “Fancy Bear.” From the binary analysis point of view, I can tell you that the activities of these attackers have been during Russian working hours, either centered on UTC+3 or UTC+4; they don’t work Russian holidays; they work Monday to Friday; there are language identifiers inside that are Russian; when you look at all the victim profiles they would be in interest to the Russian nation-state. </p>

<p>Now, could all those things be false flags? Sure. </p>

<p><strong>Can you point to any other attacks conducted by the same groups—Sofacy and The Dukes?</strong> There was another attack that happened in the Ukraine. So in December, in the Ukraine, all the power went out to about 260,000 households, or customers. They basically infiltrated the power company, got access to the machines that controlled the power, they flipped the computer switches off and shut down the power, and then they began to wipe all the machines and devices—overriding the hard drives and trashing the machines so that they couldn’t be started up again, or so that the switches couldn’t come on again. </p>

<p><strong>Who is Guccifer 2.0?</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-36913000">http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-36913000</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Detailed analysis of the attack on the DNC by US security firm CrowdStrike suggests the organisation was actually penetrated twice - both times by hacking groups, dubbed Cozy Bear and Fancy Bear, known to have links to the Russian state. These groups have successfully penetrated US federal organisations in other hack attacks.</p>

<p>Forensic examination of metadata in copies of documents distributed by Guccifer 2.0 suggest they were edited on a machine set up for a Russian language user. </p>

<p>Technical information including IP addresses extracted from messages sent by Guccifer 2.0 to journalists show a link to the Russian cyber-underground - even though many of the conversations were routed through a French VPN firm. In the past, some of the same infrastructure was used to send junk spam on behalf of Russian crime groups.</p>

<p>Yes. The person claiming to be the hacker has openly mocked the different analyses and repeated their assertion that they are Romanian and have no backing from the Russian state.</p>

<p>However, in interviews with the media, Guccifer 2.0 did not seem to speak Romanian well. </p>

<p><strong>How did Fancybear/CozyBear hack the DNC?</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/how-experts-decided-russia-hacked-dnc-election/">https://www.cnet.com/news/how-experts-decided-russia-hacked-dnc-election/</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Those clues included small fragments of code called PowerShell commands. A PowerShell command is like a Russian nesting doll in reverse. Start with the smallest doll, and that&#39;s the PowerShell code. It&#39;s only a single string of seemingly meaningless numbers and letters. Open it up, though, and out jumps a larger module that, in theory at least, &quot;can do virtually anything on the victim system,&quot; Alperovitch wrote.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>One of the PowerShell modules inside the DNC system connected to a remote server and downloaded more PowerShells, adding more nesting dolls to the DNC network. Another opened and installed MimiKatz, malicious code for stealing login information. That gave hackers a free pass to move from one part of the DNC&#39;s network to another by logging in with valid usernames and passwords. These were Cozy Bear&#39;s weapons of choice.</p>

<p>Fancy Bear used tools known as X-Agent and X-Tunnel to remotely access and control the DNC network, steal passwords and transfer files. Other tools let them wipe away their footprints from network logs.</p>

<p>CrowdStrike had seen this pattern many times before.</p>

<p>&quot;You could never go into the DNC as a single event and come up with that [conclusion],&quot; said Robert M. Lee, CEO of cybersecurity firm Dragos.</p>

<p>They agreed that the evidence points to Russia. You choose not to believe it (despite any actual evidence pointing at it <em>not</em> being Russia). Which is fine. You&#39;re right, fingerprints on the weapon is circumstantial and not definitive.</p>

<p>Thanks for answering the question.</p>

<p>I just wonder if you set the same standard of evidence with regards to the Seth Rich narrative... or pizzagate... Where are the &quot;Seth Rich-Hysteria is Bullshit&quot; and the &quot;Pizzagate-Hysteria is Bullshit&quot; posts at? They certainly don&#39;t meet this standard of proof.</p>

<p>What circumstantial evidence? Does it come even <em>close</em> to the circumstantial evidence we have on Russia?</p>

<p>We have no evidence that he talked to WL (other than anons).</p>

<p>We have no evidence of what his motives were (he had just been promoted and was going to accept the offer).</p>

<p>We have no evidence of <em>how</em> he would have done it (he was not a hacker and had no special access to other people&#39;s emails).</p>

<p>WRT the Russia narrative, we have evidence (forensic, circumstantial, etc). We have people lying under oath. We can identify motives and means.</p>

<p>Do you <em>really</em> believe the SR narrative is stronger?</p>

<p>No. He was a Clinton supporter and was going to accept a promotion to work on her campaign. There is no evidence that Pandas4Bernie (plural pandas) is SR.

<p>No. I simply asked for evidence. Of which none exists. Even if it <em>was</em> a leaker, no evidence points to Seth Rich.</p>

<p><strong>Hannity:</strong> That&#39;s such a good point. Let me ask you about Craig Murray, former British Ambassador to Uzbekestan. An associate of yours, he was quoted in the Daily Mail that he flew to Washington DC for the emails. He claimed he had a clandestine handoff in a wooded area near American University with one of the email sources, and the leakers motivation was &quot;disgust at the corruption of the Clinton Foundation and the tilting of the Primary election playing field against Bernie Sanders&quot; and he said the source had legal access to the information. The documents came from inside leaks, not from hacks.</p>

<ul>

<p>There is so much myth making and speculation in here. For starters you have no evidence Seth Rich was a potential leaker. You should start there before claiming Hillary and Podesta had a motive to kill him.  And motive means a little more than &quot;Anyone who might not like anyone else&quot;</p>

<p>Step out of your fantasy world. Everyone has the means to hire assassins. This is pure speculative fiction unless you provide evidence.  Of which there is none.

    <div class="md"><p>Lol anonymous sources. Do trump supporters and right wingers not know how news agencies work, or are you guys just too young and never read a newspaper before? The news has been operating on anonymous sources forever. If you reveal your sour email, you lose it. Reporters depend on tips from whistle blowers to get insider information. Now right wingers don&#39;t trust anonymous sources because they don&#39;t like what&#39;s being leaked about the trump administration. It&#39;s been fun seeing conservatives with their heads in the sand though. Maybe soon you&#39;ll wake up and realize this isn&#39;t a Dem conspiracy, but an FBI criminal investigation. </p>

<p>It&#39;s deeply odd and clearly inappropriate that he was meeting with Kislyak to talk lifting sanctions just then imposed on them before Trump had even won, keeping in mind that the sanctions were imposed because of Russian espionage that strongly appeared to have been engineered to assist Trump.</p>

<p>Has it occurred to you that there <em>was</em> &quot;out of the ordinary&quot; Russian espionage?</p>

<p>But whatever, that&#39;s actually irrelevant - it wasn&#39;t normal.

    <div class="md"><p>Why should it be surprising that people in the US at the highest levels of business and government also have connections to people in Russia at the highest levels of business and government?</p>

<p>You could have taken the same fine tooth comb to the Obama administration, or Bush, or Clinton and found the exact same kinds of connections.</p>

<p>We live in a global, connected world and despite the fantasy world you are led to believe exist, the &quot;movie version of life&quot;, the reality is that Russia and the US are extremely similar and connected in millions of ways.</p>

<p>Why is this entire premise based also based around the fact that &quot;Russians are evil&quot; and anyone with connections to them must be &quot;up to no good&quot;.</p>

<p>Should I be worried if an administration had a lot of connections to Spain?</p>

<p>Or Australia?</p>

<p>or Brazil? Etc....</p>

<p>I have spent the last 10 years traveling the world extensively and once you leave the Western bubble, you come to realize certain things. &quot;The evil Russians&quot; is part of an elaborate fantasy and once you realize that, it becomes much easier to see why the government needs a &quot;boogey-man} in their back pocket to pull out whenever they need people to believe their latest magic-trick.</p>

<p>Russia is no more good or evil than any other superpower in the world. And once again, Washington DC and the people at every high level of business has been connected to their counterparts in Russia for decades now. It is only currently being paraded around as part of a larger bullshit narrative. And it obviously works. Look how people eat it up.</p>

<p>This is how propaganda has always worked: lets focus on something that has been completely normal for generations and act like it is a new thing by showing evidence of it. People, in masses, have no attention span or long-term memory and the few people who actually see through the bullshit will simply be marginalized.</p>

If Trump and all of the cronies he had to fire are innocent, then they will be vindicated in the end. But it&#39;s odd that Mike Flynn is avoiding his subpoena and will plead the 5th over this shit. It&#39;s odd that all these reports are coming out of Trump telling everyone to back off the investigation. It&#39;s a little strange that he fired the guy heading the investigation. Why don&#39;t we wait to see what else comes out before we jump to conclusions? Yet I continue to see 5-10 posts a day on here telling me I&#39;m crazy and stupid for following this story.

    <div class="md"><p>I believe Trump has sketchy connections with Russia. But where is the proof for the Russians hacking the election?

    <div class="md"><p>They are looking into whether or not Flynn and/or Kushner made a deal with them. It&#39;s certainly possible that they offered a relief from sanctions or something else in exchange for the help in getting elected. They certainly were in contact with the russians often during the campaign and after. Flynn got fired after he lied to Pence about speaking with the Russians about sanctions. We don&#39;t know yet. </p>

<p>And that Syria bombing was a joke. They just moved the rest of the planes at that base to a Russian controlled base. We aren&#39;t going to bomb any russians there. Trump warned them to get out before we bombed them. There&#39;s not gonna be another cold war. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay. Let&#39;s be proper conspiracy theorists, and lets apply critical thinking. The two sides of the coin, the media, who some believe in on a conspiracy to distract/control the public with a false story claiming that Russia and Trump are colluding, vs Trump and his campaign, who some believe to be colluding.</p>

<p>First method of discerning the truth, Occam&#39;s Razor. Party A says Party B did something illegal. Party B says all of Party A is tied up in a propaganda/conspiracy stunt. Party A&#39;s story holds up better under the Razor. But that&#39;s a really, really dumb way of determining the truth, and is effectively irrelevant to this sub.</p>

<p>Second method, motivations. </p>

<p>What does each party have to lose? Plenty of the media is widely believed to be trustworthy, if Comey turns around and says all of this stuff from anonymous sources is false, they lose a ton of trust-ability. That&#39;s a huge loss to them. Trump. If his lies are wrong here, they&#39;ll be added to the pile. I think we can all agree he&#39;s a serial liar.</p>

<p>What does each party have to gain? The media would gain increased views. And, according to the crazier theories, &#39;their viewers wouldn&#39;t become smart and escape from the trap of mainstream media&#39;. Trump, on the other hand, is profiting in profits and by being the most powerful man on Earth. That&#39;s <em>huge</em>.</p>

<p>The way I see it, Trump has nothing to lose, and everything to gain. The media has much to lose, and not much to gain.</p>

<p>And, since this is my first real post here, a message to y&#39;all. I like this sub. I thought I wouldn&#39;t, but I like it. Although, almost by definition, there will be plenty of logical fallacies or just plain misinformation here, the community looks great. It feels, so far, like people that legitimately want to find truth, unlike plenty of other subs, where it feels like self-confirmation bias confirming.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re so concerned about governments interfering in foreign elections look at the USA. We don&#39;t just publish fake internet stories we invade countries, overthrow governments, assassinate politicians. Ever hear of Salvador Allende in Chile? Mossadegh in Iran?

    <div class="md"><p>The goal is to find the truth. I really enjoy that pursuit (in fact it is part of my job), and I trust my judgement very much. I am of the opinion that the Russia did not have any meaningful role in our election. I also doubt that Trump has any corrupt ties to Russia, but I have an open mind and I would certainly look at any valid evidence that suggests as much. Finally, I think that there is a definite possibility that Seth was the leaker, but the jury is still out.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>the thing is even if it really wanted it didn&#39;t need to. Pretty much the same result can be achieved by simple rumours like now. Look at what is happening, the USA political establishment is in chaos. There no political or even inter-party unity. 
And considering it was the democrats who cast the first stone by screaming &quot;russians are hacking us&quot; then they did worse than any kind of russian interference in US politics. </p>

<p>There really is no need to expend all that effort to put someone in power when the establishment itself is ready to tear itself into pieces on simple rumours. And it has been clear that it was going to happen sooner or later for anyone who has watched american politics over the last few years, they have been increasingly more combative and the general stance is that if you vote for the other party you are stupid. </p>

<p>So yeah, Russia didn&#39;t interfere because there was no real reason to even want to. US politicians do it better on their own. </p>

<p>Conservative media are who focuses on the DNC leaks, not this liberal or even Democratic as a whole.  </p>

<p>This liberal sees evidence that not only the current Administration was playing footsie with the Russians, some of our Congress critters are as well.  </p>

<p>The DNC wikileaks did not affect Democratic voters in the negative way the MSM and conservative media keeps positing.  </p>

<p>The real problem with the very fake, very controlled election was successful voter suppression and what now looks like a conspiracy to dump NATO, EU and align the U.S. with Russia, no one really mentions that. </p>

<p>Can you explain why Flynn needed to be an inside the White House, but  unofficial, backdoor to Russia contacts? Because his Russian connections were ignored by Pence, Priebus, and Trump?</p>

<p>Leaks, not a hack.</p>

<p>I have never claimed the DNC was hacked, not here, not anywhere.</p>

<p>If I lean any direction on the DNC leaks, I would suggest Rich was a conservative mole of his own creation.  </p>

<p>Like this.  </p>

<p>I support Bernie, I hate Hillary, I will harm Hillary . . . but it all went bad, I don&#39;t think he was a strong ideologue, but a very
self  misdirected  young man. </p>

<p>And if I were pressed, I would suggest he was therefore not &quot;reliable,&quot; as a source and had to be eliminated to hide the source of the leak. </p>

<p>I also believe there were actual moles in Hillary&#39;s campaign, from U.S. sources and I base that on a few really horrific, &quot;miss-steps,&quot; 
made by Hillary and her campaign, that were so lame and damaging I can&#39;t imagine any Democratic, moderate or not would have used or deployed. </p>

<p>The most memorable and glaring,  &quot;deplorables,&quot;  positively sickened me when I saw it and against everything the Democratic party has ever stood for.    There were others, like her backing down on the minimum wage increase and supporting more EITC. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The forensic evidence linking the DNC breach to known Russian operations is very strong. On June 20, two competing cybersecurity companies, Mandiant (part of FireEye) and Fidelis, confirmed CrowdStrike’s initial findings that Russian intelligence indeed hacked the DNC. The forensic evidence that links network breaches to known groups is solid: used and reused tools, methods, infrastructure, even unique encryption keys. For example: in late March the attackers registered a domain with a typo—misdepatrment[.]com—to look suspiciously like the company hired by the DNC to manage its network, MIS Department. They then linked this deceptive domain to a long-known APT 28 so-called X-Tunnel command-and-control IP address, 45.32.129[.]185.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>One of the strongest pieces of evidence linking GRU to the DNC hack is the equivalent of identical fingerprints found in two burglarized buildings: a reused command-and-control address—176.31.112[.]10—that was hard coded in a piece of malware found both in the German parliament as well as on the DNC’s servers. Russian military intelligence was identified by the German domestic security agency BfV as the actor responsible for the Bundestag breach.

<p>There&#39;s a shitload of &#39;evidence&#39; out there (IT forensics conducted and corroborated by multiple independent cybersecurity firms), but you&#39;ll keep crying &quot;where&#39;s the evidence?&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They excluded evidence that contradicted their hypothesis. You can&#39;t say they reached a reliable conclusion. The only other source for this claim is the piss dossier and that is also unverified and problematic. I have not stated that Seth Rich is the source of the leaks so don&#39;t put words in my mouth. I am saying that the Intelligence Community needs to put up or shut up about the evidence. If we are gonna start a new Cold War the public deserves proof. The Intelligence Community has a terrible track record when it comes to exactly these issues: making huge claims, not providing any proof, said claims influence geopolitical events, and then it turns out their information was false.

    <div class="md"><p>My mistake on attributing that quote to CrowdStrike. CrowdStrike based their conclusion on the 2014 report from FireEye, which analyized the hacking group APT28. APT28 is the group that CrowdStrike claims hacked the DNC. FireEye says that they excluded evidence that doesn&#39;t support their conclusion that APT28 is the work of the Russian government. </p>

<p>Other cybersecurity companies: Kaspersky Lab, ESET, TrendMicro, Microsoft, iSight Partners, and AlienLab have made similar claims of attribution to the Russian government. However FireEye’s Director of Threat Intelligence speaking about APT28 on 10/28/14 defines it with a narrow operational mission that doesn&#39;t fit all the evidence.</p>

<p>“With the Russian group, the victim set is narrow and the type of operations occurring are distinct from intellectual property and financial data theft that the Chinese groups focus on,”</p>

<p>FireEye deliberately excluded many targets of APT28 for being “not particularly indicative of a specific sponsor’s interests.”</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p>A PriceWaterhouseCoopers report mentioned energy companies and web service providers as additional targets.</p>

<p>Bitdefender’s report added ecrime services and telecommunications companies as targets.</p>

<p>FireEye lists defense trade shows and exhibitions as being frequently targeted by this group as well. </p>

<p>Let&#39;s assume that CrowdStrike is correct and assume the responsible party are Russian hackers employed by one or more of Russia’s intelligence services. They used APT28 malware developed and maintained by a Russian lab...</p>

<p>Or   the DNC was breached by a Russian-speaking hacker who is not employed by the Russian intelligence services but has access to the APT28 malware...</p>

<p>Or   the DNC was breached by a Russian hacker who does contract work for the FSB when he isn’t running his own hacker-for-hire business for Russian oligarchs and Swiss lawyers...</p>

<p>Or  the DNC was breached by multiple actors including all of the above.</p>

<p>All of these are plausible if you believe CrowdStrikes claim. (Which I do not). To say that this is evidence which points unequivocally to the Kremlin is naive. </p>

<p>The Intelligence Community says it has classified information which proves the hacking narrative, proof that is apparently unrelated to these cyber-security firms. They should present that information to the public.</p>

<p>Trivial stuff bro. Those cases are not as interesting or unusual as the ones examined in that particular paper. The ones examined demonstrate clearly an exclusive geopolitical agenda that is broadly consistent with only one plausible culprit: Russia. </p>

<p>That the others were excluded from this very brief outline does not detract from this premise.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Yeah, if &lt;overly elaborate hypothesis not supported by any sound logical explanation&gt;.</p>

<p>The pattern is clear enough - the fingerprints and methods used in hacks that were almost certainly done to benefit the Russian state in its own backyard (i.e. in Georgia and Ukraine, for pro-Russian goals) were found in a prolonged cyber attack on the Democratic party in the US. That&#39;s where the evidence points <em>with the highest probability</em>, and you&#39;ve done nothing to change that fact.</p>

<p>You can bring-up &#39;Russian oligarchs&#39; and &#39;Swiss lawyers&#39; all you want ... where&#39;s <em>your</em> evidence, eh?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>To say that this is evidence which points unequivocally to the Kremlin is naive.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Who said that? The US IC concludes with &quot;high confidence&quot;, and few in the tech community view the evidence as conclusive.</p>

<p>This is a <em>theory</em>, an inference to the best explanation, based upon the available evidence of multiple independent cyber-forensic investigations, which all points in only one direction. Rather than follow the evidence where it goes, you&#39;ve decided to work backwards from your conclusion (not Russia!).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Intelligence Community says it has classified information which proves the hacking narrative, proof that is apparently unrelated to these cyber-security firms. They should present that information to the public.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Any such information would absolutely be of the very highest classification, and the NSA/CIA/etc aren&#39;t going to burn their best sources on a dangerous adversary by making it all public. Are you fucken kidding? Be reasonable man.</p>

<p>Even if they did, you wouldn&#39;t accept it anyway - you&#39;ve made that much clear. Important Republican representatives have access to this stuff, and so does the Whitehouse - Trump is the about only person in government who still doesn&#39;t seem to agree. Weird, huh?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wonder if everyone knows, of if we&#39;re a dying breed. I think they hope we&#39;re a dying breed, but then again Trump did win despite their very vocally trying to make us feel as though we were alone. Not that I like Trump, but just that Hillary personified everything that is now, ironically, taking over and I think everyone feels that, which resulted in us analogously choosing to gnaw off our own leg to avoid the trapper by voting for Trump over the NWO/Illuminati/(((Them)))/whatever your flavor of dishonest conspirators with access to the keys to power, no morals, and no desire to see good be done. </p>

<p>I&#39;m with you, though.. I don&#39;t even like to talk about it because I feel like I have to be hopeful to inspire hope in others, but I feel less and less of a connection to this place every day. They&#39;ve pretty much taken it over. </p>

<p>The front page is a smattering of obvious social engineering (disproportionate and forced praise of minorities and currently trending social groups, often times with a distinct lack of quality); ads; forced talking points; contrived creativity; and beneath it all, an ocean of distrust. </p>

Its pretty frustrating that more people don&#39;t see it and sometimes I feel a bit hopeless, too. I think the best thing to do is to lead by example and discuss this sort of stuff with people who aren&#39;t aware in little, bite-sized tidbits. </p>

<p>I do worry about the future, though. They already have so much control over what the average person is exposed to, and I imagine that it can only feel worse. But at the same time, I think more and more people are becoming &quot;red pilled.&quot; I know I have only recently begun to notice the extent of the propaganda, and honestly, despite his flaws, some of that is due to Trump. </p>

<p>I agree that being hopeless and pessimistic is the worst thing we can do. I think we have to try our best to be successful and explain why we feel the way we do to people in a patient, understanding, and kind way.</p>

<p>The FBI, CIA, and NSA all stated that they are confident it was the Russians.

<p>&quot;“As far as hacking, I think it was Russia,” Trump said. “Hacking’s bad, and it shouldn’t be done. But look at the things that were hacked, look at what was learned from that hacking.”&quot;</p>

<p>Right there. He freaking says it</p>

<p>The thing you&#39;re missing is that Trump has literally no reason to lie and say it was the Russians. It absolutely hurts him, and the fact that he admits it is enough to assume that the Russians are guilty of hacking the DNC. There has been no evidence that suggests otherwise.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Trump literally admitted&quot; is such a load of out-of-context crap.</p>

<p>Here is the full transcript so people can see the full context.</p>

<p>REINCE PRIEBUS, INCOMING WHITE HOUSE CHIEF OF STAFF:  Good morning, Chris.  </p>

<p>The nation’s intel chiefs laid out the full classified report to President-elect Trump and others in his team, including you that Russian president Vladimir Putin ordered a cyber attack to interfere with the election and eventually came to try to help Donald Trump.  </p>

<p>Simple question: does the president-elect accept the findings and the evidence of the intelligence community?</p>

<p>PRIEBUS:  Well, I think he accepts the findings, Chris.  But here&#39;s the thing that I think everyone needs to understand -- when this whole thing started, it started from the Russians 50 years ago.  In other words, this is something that&#39;s been going on in our elections for many, many years, both the Russians, the Chinese, the Iranians.  It happens every election period.  </p>

<p>Now, in this particular case, it started way back in 2015 before either nominee of either party was chosen, and it started, and this is declassified, as a spear phishing exhibition over many different institutions.  It just so happened that the DNC had nearly no defenses on their system, and when they were warned multiple times by the FBI, they didn&#39;t respond.  </p>

<p>And so, suddenly, you have a major political party, one of the biggest political parties in the world, that by their own admission lacked defenses, lacked training, and allowed a foreign government into their entire email system without responding to the FBI.  </p>

<p>So, yes, we have bad actors around the world.  We have had bad actors, including the Russians.  But we also have a problem when we have a major political institution that allows foreign governments into their system with hardly any defenses or training.  That&#39;s a huge story, and that&#39;s what people aren’t talking about as well.  </p>

<p>WALLACE:  That&#39;s a fair point.  And it’s also, we should point out, there is no evidence that the Russians in any way were able to get into the electoral system and tamper with the vote count.  </p>

<p>But on Friday, hours before he had the briefing, Donald Trump said that this was, quote, &quot;a political witch hunt&quot;.  </p>

<p>So, I just want to be very clear on two political points.  Does he now accepts -- but you say, well, this has been going on for years, never to this extent, never the hacking and dissemination of emails, and you could argue as to whether they were in some way were complicit in it because of their weaknesses, that we’ve never had this kind of dissemination before.  Does he accept that the Russians were behind this hacking campaign?  Yes or no?  </p>

<p>PRIEBUS:  Well, sure.  I mean, he&#39;s not denying that entities in Russia were behind this particular campaign.  But let me just -- can you -- let me respond to your point, though.  You say never have we had such a massive -- yes, but here&#39;s what we have.  We have the DNC as a sitting duck.  </p>

<p>So, if you have a person -- wait a second, because it matters to your point.  It matters because if the DNC allows any foreign entity into their system, says, here is 50,000 emails, you can have them.  Well, voila!  Now, you have the biggest dissemination of emails that we’ve ever seen in the history of America because we have a revolving door at the DNC.</p>

<p>WALLACE:  Who do you blame more for this?  Who do you blame more for this, Reince?  Do you blame Putin and the Kremlin?  Or do you blame the DNC?  Who is the primary actor here?  </p>

<p>PRIEBUS:  Well, listen, the primary actor is the foreign entity that’s perpetrating the crime to begin with, no doubt about it.</p>

<p>WALLACE:  Which was?  Which was?  </p>

<p>PRIEBUS:  I’m not denying that.  </p>

<p>WALLACE:  Which was?</p>

<p>PRIEBUS:  I’m not denying that.  I’m not denying that.</p>

<p>WALLACE:  And what was that foreign entity?</p>

<p>PRIEBUS:  The thing is -- Russia.  </p>

<p>But what I’m telling you is that we also have a situation where you have people at the DNC -- let me ask you this.  Anyone listening out there, if you had multiple calls from the FBI and you said, &quot;By the way, Chris, this is the FBI, I think someone is in your system and stealing all of your emails&quot;, and you ignore multiple, multiple calls.  </p>

<p>They attempted to attack the RNC in the same way.  They didn’t get into our system because number one, we had our head straight and we had defenses at the RNC.  But number two, when the FBI called the RNC and said, we’ve got a hacking situation, we brought them in immediately.</p>

<p>And so, granted we have bad actors around the world, and cyber attacks have been happening for years, but we also have an entity that&#39;s allowed through a wide open door a foreign government into their system.  </p>

<p>WALLACE:  I get that.  </p>

<p>One other question.  </p>

<p>PRIEBUS:  Go ahead.</p>

<p>WALLACE:  Does President-elect Trump accept the evidence that he heard, does he find it persuasive, that Putin&#39;s interest towards the end of the campaign was to help Trump by discrediting Clinton?  </p>

<p>PRIEBUS:  I haven&#39;t asked him about that, Chris.  I mean, he accepts the fact that Russia and other entities engaged in cyber attacks on the United States all day long.  He accepts the fact that this particular case was entities in Russia.  So, that&#39;s not the issue.  </p>

<p>But -- and if you look at his statement, after he commends the intelligence community in the very first paragraph, he talks about the particular hack.  He talks about the fact that the DNC was a sitting duck while at the RNC had its act together.  He then says in the first 90 days of his administration, he is going to order a full report as to what we can do to be better.  </p>

<p>But one of the things we can do to be better is when the FBI calls you and says you have a problem, you return the phone call.  </p>

<p>WALLACE:  Well, I want to ask about that, because he said yesterday in which he said that we want to have better relations with Russia.  I mean, if he accepts the fact that they, in an unprecedented way, tried to interfere with our election, does that mean he is not going to respond, he&#39;s not going to take action against Russia?  </p>

<p>PRIEBUS:  He very well, he&#39;s going to order the intelligence community to make recommendations, and whatever those recommendations are will be discussed and actions may be taken, but I don&#39;t think there&#39;s anything wrong with trying to have a good relationship with Russia and other countries around the world.  And that&#39;s what the president is saying, that he is going to have good relationships around the world that will put America first, bring jobs back and make a safer across the globe.  That&#39;s what he wants to do and I think that&#39;s what he will do.  </p>

<p>WALLACE:  I want to consider the question of the president-elect&#39;s relations, not with Russia, but with the intelligence community.  Because here was a tweet that he put out on Tuesday.  &quot;The, quote, ‘intelligence’ briefly on the so-called, quote, ‘Russian hacking’ was delayed until Friday.  Perhaps more time needed to build a case.  Very strange.&quot;</p>

Trump, who has every reason to say the opposite admitted that it was the Russians. So either there is some extremely convuluted reason why the intelligence agencies are all out to get Trump and Trump would lie against hsi own interests, the default stance should be that Russia hacked the election. I don&#39;t trust Trump for shit but I don&#39;t expect him to lie when lying goes against his self interests.</p>

<p>What???? Saying the Russians are guilty would do anything but dissasociate the story. You&#39;re trying so hard to come up with reasons why he would lie when it&#39;s so much more likely that he was admitting the truth. Occam&#39;s razor.</p>

<p>Why would they want to remove the candidate who ran on massive increases in defense spending? A man who as president directly attacked a Syrian government airfield and has shown great deference to the military?

    <div class="md"><p>There are many different actors pushing this narrative. The first to start pushing it was Clinton and the DNC during the primary. The only group to have examined the DNC’s server is Crowdstrike, a cyber-security group connected to both the DNC and the Atlantic Council, a pro-Nato anti-Russia/Iran think tank.</p>

<p>Trump ran as a nationalist candidate who claimed to want to deescalate tensions with Russia, be non-interventionist in foreign policy, and stop multinational trade deals. (Not that anything he claimed actually mattered). This is contrary to the bipartisan consensus that has held Washington together for decades. Trump may bend to the neocon agenda but he is bad PR, bad spokesperson, and is unmasking the corruption of the government in a really obvious way. This is an obvious motive for them to want to impeach him and put someone like Pence in.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So I guess I&#39;m just confused about what&#39;s happening because there have been plenty of leaks about trump collusion but no evidence. It seems like it&#39;s been leaks &gt; scandal &gt; call for impeachment but there is a whole process between scandal and impeachment where actual evidence is needed but I keep hearing there is no evidence from the intelligence community. With all these leakers,it seems so obvious that there is collusion, but how has there been no evidence if all these leakers are claiming they have evidence of collusion?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>we are still in the scandal phase. The part you are missing in all this is that impeachment is a fully political process. The FBI cannot arrest or prosecute the president only the legisilature can. So first there has to be a scandal that turns the public and in this case the republicans against trump. Evidence comes later when this investigation moves into the more public phases with grand juries and legitimate congressional investigations and finally impeachment proceedings. The FBI isn&#39;t about to drop their whole case to the public early to appease the few true believers who don&#39;t see the writing on the wall.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well it seems you have your mind made up already. I&#39;d just like to see some evidence since it&#39;s been almost a year and nothing has come out except for anonymous sources saying things that in many cases have turned out to be completely false. If the POTUS was compromised and there was evidence, he would be gone by now. Since they don&#39;t have evidence, they are going to string the public along with the investigation for the next couple years until midterm elections. It all looks like standard political theater to me, but maybe I&#39;ve just been around long enough to see that politics is just a show and dems and repubs are the actors. </p>

<p>i suspect that EVERYONE at that level of government has stronger ties undue influence than they would claim.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t really doubt that Trump himself has shady russia connections- probably organized crime and shady oligarchs.  but what I DO doubt is that &quot;the election was hacked&quot; by russian intelligence operatives working on behalf of the russian government.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Russian narrative has definitely transformed from it&#39;s inception, and I think a lot of it had to do with simple phrasing.  Did Russia hack anything? Maybe.  It&#39;s very, very possible.  You&#39;d be a fool to think they aren&#39;t capable of something like that, especially considering what we know OUR government has to hack computers.  </p>

<p>And by transformed, I&#39;m talking about the daily developments of Trump and his teams collusion with Russia.  And yes, it is a VERY big deal regardless of what you want to believe.  He&#39;s the goddamned president!  It&#39;s much much more than Russia hacked the DNC.  Russia very well may have hacked Trump, and that&#39;s a fucked up thing.  We don&#39;t need a puppet in the White House, and if he&#39;s so casual as to give up intel to Russians during chit chatting, who knows what he will give up, or has already?  </p>

<p>American intelligence agencies - several of them - tell me that it was Russia hacked the email servers, and on the other hand Kim Dotcom and a bunch of people on message boards tell me that Seth Rich leaked those emails. Both don&#39;t show any evidence. Which one is more trustworthy? Well, Kim Dotcom wasn&#39;t wrong on Iraq, but still...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not ya pal, buddy!</p>

<p>Anyway. The issue with the Hillary emails is that the issue of State department and White house staffers have been forwarding documents to their personal emails for years and for a really boring and stupid reason.</p>

<p>Their network is out of date and fussy as fuck and so is their email system.  This means that it is often way easier to forward emails to personal accounts, like gmail accounts, and print them using that interface.  The security on their system is also out of date and sadly, private servers often have better security than those of the US government.  Add that in with the fact that Hillary could not use a PC and could only use a massively out of date BlackBerry and yeah, I honestly feel like that&#39;s the more logical reason that they used a private server.</p>

<p>But I&#39;m sure we&#39;ll disagree.  Can I ask what you think that Comey did badly with the Russia investigation?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not the use that matters as much as lying about everything and deleting stuff that makes it a crime. If Comey thought that is was okay for Clinton to lie and delete evidence. Then why would it be any different for Trump?</p>

<p>Oh course you may. Comey has already confirmed on 3 occasions that there in no evidence after 9 months of investigation. What rock was not looked under after that amount of time. Furthermore the FBI has never seen the DNC server to inspect it and only took the word of an independent IT company that it was hacked by &quot;russians&quot;. </p>

<p>Either there is no evidence of russians or Comey is bad at his job or both. </p>

<p>What makes you think there is going to someday be proof russia and Trump is a thing? Why do you excuse Hillary for breaking the rules but so badly want to caught Trump doing it?</p>

<p>I don&#39;t want to believe that Trump colluded with Russia because that would be bad for my country.  I don&#39;t want to believe that this could be a thing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not about Hillary. It&#39;s about Russian. Where you brought up Comey. So, here I am telling you why Comey was not the right man for the job. Because Hillary knew she shouldn&#39;t have that server and then when she was asked to turn it over... she deleted 33,000 emails. To which Comey said no wrong doing. </p>

<p>So SIR! Do  you agree that if Comey let her slide on that, he might also let Trump slide on deleting 33,000 emails?</p>

<p>Therefore he should be fired because he might let Trump go. IF there is collusion.</p>

<p>Agreed?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m a ma&#39;am, not a sir.   </p>

<p>If one of Hillary&#39;s staffers, much less her National security advisor, was accused of collusion with Russia, I&#39;d have a problem with deletion of emails, sure.  If they were work emails and not personal emails, which the FBI had concluded that the deleted emails were all personal and not work emails.</p>

<p>Either way, Comey&#39;s firing was fishy and weird and the timing was as well.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, that&#39;s the misinterpreted Clapper quote I&#39;m referencing.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Reporter: Let me ask you this. Does intelligence exist that can definitively answer the following question -- whether there were improper contacts between the Trump campaign and Russian officials?</p>

<p>Clapper: We did not include any evidence in our report, and I say &quot;our&quot; -- that&#39;s NSA, FBI, and CIA, with my office, the director of national intelligence -- that had anything-- that had any reflection of collusion between members of the Trump campaign and the Russians. There was no evidence of that included in our report.</p>

<p>Reporter: I understand that, but does it exist?</p>

<p>Clapper: ... not to my knowledge.</p>

<p>Reporter: If it existed, it would have been in the report?</p>

<p>Clapper: This could have unfolded, uh, or become, uh, uh, available in the time since I left the government. But at the time, we had no evidence of, of such collusion.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This video was recorded ~3 months ago, and Clapper&#39;s resignation from the government was effective as of mid-January 2017. </p>

<p>So, he is actually saying that <em>he was not aware of any evidence of collusion as of mid-January 2017</em>, and that no evidence was included in their report.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve seen this line peddled a lot recently-  that the investigation into the Russian connection is centred around one thing and one thing only - the hack - so if the hack is false then it proves there is zero connections between the Trump admin and Russia.

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t understand how people can be so dismissive about the possibility that Russia helped Trump win the election in some way. Do people honestly believe that Russia <em>wouldn&#39;t</em> try to influence the US election in some way of they could? If they had one candidate trying to start a war with them and another candidate looking to work with them in some way...just seems like common sense. The US influences elections around the world all the time for this same reason, and I&#39;m sure Russia does the same.</p>

<p>It&#39;s quite possible the Trump himself didn&#39;t even realize that Russia was influencing the election...perhaps Russia was smart about it and had Trump surrogates on the inside helping them out without involving the president directly in order to avoid linking directly back to him. So maybe Trump legitimately was not aware of Russian involvement, but perhaps had suspicions which is why he started sweating an investigation and began firing people.</p>

<p>To be dismissive just because it&#39;s a theory being tossed around by MSM and the left is just as ridiculous as buying into the Russia narrative 100%. Best to keep an open mind and leave open different possibilities.</p>

<p>In other words, &quot;if Donald Trump is 100% controlled by Putin, it&#39;s legal and I dismiss any criticism of Trump on that basis!&quot;</p>

<p>No, it&#39;s not. Trump is not a member of the DOJ. He is not a member of the FBI. He is not a member of the IRS, CIA, or your local rotary club. Saying &quot;no one in the DOJ attempted to stop the investigation&quot; <strong>by no means</strong> precludes from having tried to stop it. </p>

<p>According to Comey, Trump did say about the investigation &quot;let it go&quot;, more than once. Comey refused, and was fired (and this is important) <strong>because of his refusal to terminate the investigation, by Trump&#39;s own admission</strong>. </p>

<p>This is a lie repeated by the media, which is why you were unable to source it.  Trump has NEVER said he fired Comey for refusing to terminate the &quot;muh Russia&quot; witch hunt.  Also, firing the director of the FBI had 0 effect on any investigations.  Investigations don&#39;t just go away because the FBI director was fired.</p>

<p>In fact, <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/347867207/Comey-firing-letters#from_embed">the Attny General and Dept Attny General both provided a written recommendation to fire Comey (see pages 3 and 4)</a>.  Trump pulled the trigger after <a href="http://www.politicususa.com/2017/05/08/james-comey-busted-lying-congress-clinton-emails-testimony.html">Comey was caught lying to a Congressional inquiry</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice#/media/File:US_Department_of_Justice_Organizational_Chart.png">Here&#39;s a DOJ org chart</a>.  Notice the top is &quot;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Attorney_General">Office of Attorney General</a>&quot;.  Guess who that person is hired by, can be dismissed by, and reports to?  YEP, the President of the United States.  No amount of mental gymnastics will make the President of the United States NOT the leader of the entire executive branch, so you can keep &quot;but.. but... I need a chart!&quot;</p>

<p>Well Trump himself disagrees with you. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;But regardless of [the] recommendation, I was going to fire Comey. Knowing there was no good time to do it!</p>

<p>Trump: And in fact when I decided to just do it I said to myself, I said, “You know, this Russia thing with Trump and Russia is a made-up story, it’s an excuse by the Democrats for having lost an election that they should’ve won.”</p>

<p>Must be hard to defend someone who so openly admits his wrongdoings. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>In fact, the Attny General and Dept Attny General both provided a written recommendation to fire Comey</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yet again, here&#39;s Trump:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“What I did is I was going to fire Comey, my decision,” Trump said during an interview Thursday with NBC News’ Lester Holt. “I was going to fire regardless of recommendation. He made a recommendation. He’s highly respected. Very good guy, very smart guy, the Democrats like him, the Republicans like him, he made a recommendation. But regardless of recommendation, I was going to fire Comey.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Here&#39;s a DOJ org chart</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Great! Is &quot;POTUS&quot; on there? No? Of course not, because he&#39;s not a member of the DOJ. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Guess who that person is hired by, can be dismissed by, and reports to? YEP, the President of the United States</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You&#39;re absolutely right. But Trump is not part of the DOJ. You can keep skirting around it, but that is objective fact. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>so you can keep &quot;but.. but... I need a chart!&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The chart shows who is in the DOJ and who isn&#39;t. Trump isn&#39;t. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I think you mean &quot;according to an anonymously sourced memo supposedly written by Comey from his memory of a conversation and no one has actually seen the memo or questioned Comey about it under oath&quot;, right?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, I mean the memo that Comey wrote and sent out to other top members of the IC, some of which read it to the New York Times. The same memo that the White House was questioned on, which they refused to admit existed. The same memo that has been corroborated by nearly every news agency of note. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Perhaps Russia saw Trump as being somewhat unfit/inexperienced for role as president and knew his election would cause some chaos in the US political realm (which it has). Maybe they&#39;re just doing whatever they can to knock the US down a peg, since that would in turn make Russia more powerful on the world stage.</p>

<p>It&#39;s possible they saw Clinton&#39;s rhetoric on Syria as more of a threat to them than Trump. There are many possible reasons they could favor Trump over Clinton...but it&#39;s all speculation and none of us can know the full reality of the situation. Which is why I&#39;m suggesting we keep an open mind rather than be 100% dismissive or accepting of any particular theory.</p>

<p>Yep. Most people that believe Trump/Russia ties knows that Russia didn&#39;t give the election to Trump or &quot;hack&quot; it. But Trump is in deep with Russia and that is enough for me to be concerned and paying attention to what&#39;s unfolding.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The way I see it, Russia probably did hack the emails and use 3rd parties to pass them to WL. Theres no doubt they had motive to sink Clinton. But, and its an important one, that doesn&#39;t mean they gave Trump the election or that the leaks aren&#39;t authentic. It also doesn&#39;t mean he doesn&#39;t have other concerning ties to Russia. This isn&#39;t a black and white situation like people want it to be its very complex with a lot of important nuance.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m with you. A big issue is the fact that Trump was actively encouraging these activities as they were happening while denying it was Russia, as was Roger Stone, and their team was meeting with Russian officials (which they still deny) at the time. He continues to float the DNC not letting the FBI physically examine the server too, which helps refute the greater Russian influence operation. </p>

<p>Basically, Trump can&#39;t ever admit that he was doing all that as a campaign strategy, or that he ended up benefiting bigly from the whole thing, because that would put a dent in the purity of his victory (assuming there was no coordination). So you have a situation where all the US IC, the entire Obama admin, and all these experts at the hearings are saying one thing and he can&#39;t agree, and that makes him look shitty (assuming, again, that he&#39;s innocent). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Look man people want to believe because they hate Trump and for some reason they are afraid of Russia. I can understand why baby boomers are afraid of Russia I do not understand why anyone else is. Just use logic to battle the hysteria.</p>

<p>If the Russians used bots to spread propaganda to make people not vote for Clinton why did she win the popular vote? In the DNC emails they talk about how THEY (DNC) want to prop up Trump to win the nomination because they saw him as weak. Trump won in states where he campaigned and Clinton didn&#39;t. Clinton was a terrible horrible candidate and people just refuse to accept that because they see Trump as worse than her.</p>

<p>To a lot of people they see Russia and Putin as a dictatorship who imprisons dissenters and goes to war with his neighbors over territory. I don&#39;t understand why they don&#39;t see that our government supports dictatorships around the world when it benefits us, Saudi Arabia. They stone women to death for being raped. They are committing a genocide in Yemen with our weapons. They financed and carried out 9/11 yet people are afraid of Russia. </p>

<p>Then people start screaming about Flynn this and Flynn that. Its as though they haven&#39;t known that people in our government lobby for other countries around the world and have done for a very long time. Look at AIPAC most people don&#39;t even know what that is let alone that we have dual citizenship people working in our government where we don&#39;t even know which country their loyalties are to. </p>

<p>People are afraid of Trumps business ties with Russia and that people in his cabinet are talking to the Russians. I will never ever understand why people think it is a bad thing to talk to other major powers. Everyone needs to understand that the Cold War is OVER. The Russia hysteria is being fueled by people in our government who do not want to face the future of the world. China and other Asian countries are starting a new trade partnership called the New Silk Road, we will be left behind in trade do you all understand that? If we do not get into this trading partnership like Obama didn&#39;t want to do and Trump does want to do we will slowly lose the trade war, and everyone will only then understand why we need Russia and China as allies. This isn&#39;t the 1950s anymore.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And why ask Comey to stop the investigation? I mean seriously I don&#39;t like mainstream narratives, especially when we&#39;ve been lied to many times before. Though it really seems Trumps administration was in contact with Russia. Anyone whose read Foundations of Geopolitics by Alexandsr Dugin would know that Russian intelligence has been planning this for years: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Russia should use its special services within the borders of the United States to fuel instability and separatism, for instance, provoke &quot;Afro-American racists&quot;. Russia should &quot;introduce geopolitical disorder into internal American activity, encouraging all kinds of separatism and ethnic, social and racial conflicts, actively supporting all dissident movements – extremist, racist, and sectarian groups, thus destabilizing internal political processes in the U.S. It would also make sense simultaneously to support isolationist tendencies in American politics.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Though the most interesting part is the last sentence, to support isolationist tendencies in American politics. Well Trump is that isolationist. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I feel the Russia conspiracy is the most real, most apparent of all, and it has the biggest impact on the United States government. No matter how this plays out, we are literally living through a VERY important time in American History. If Trump and team are found guilty or not, it will set a precedent for all presidents to come. For that reason alone, I hope that this whole Russia story doesn&#39;t go up in smoke. We need to hold our leaders accountable for their actions.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In my opinion this is a media/deep state campaign to impeach Trump,</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He is giving enough reason for impeachment on his own. If it was any other president in history, they would have started the proceedings. The only reason why the impeachment process hasn&#39;t started is because it is a Republican controlled government. Firing the head of the FBI while he is currently under investigation by the FBI? That should SCREAM &quot;fire&quot; to any citizen of the United States.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>to feed the military-industrial complex </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The government doesn&#39;t need to an excuse to do this. They&#39;ve been doing it more and more every year since World War II. Military contractors are treated like kings and queens while your basic grunt gets sent to war zones wearing gear built by the lowest bidder and being paid just above the poverty level. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>and manufacture consent for further escalation with Russia directly/through proxy wars like Syria,</p>
</blockquote>

<p>From my perspective, the US doesn&#39;t want to go to ACTUAL war with Russia out of fear it going nuclear (literally). This was the entire Cold War. If anything, they probably want to push a second Cold War. The first was great for the US economy and right now the US makes a LOT of money by overusing its military.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>and to divert attention away from the corruption of the DNC.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Please... the Republicans are just as corrupt as the DNC. They just do a crappier job of hiding it. Or they&#39;re just bolder about it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I dont think anyone with any credibility is saying that the Russia hacking claims are in fact 100% true. There are indicators it was Russia, and the media is running with that because they rely on sensationalist headlines to stay relevant. I find it hilarious that everyone thinks every sensationalist article is somehow a deep state psy op. Guess what, many news organizations are hurting for cash and have turned to clickbait and shitty articles in order to gain ad revenue. It is that simple. 90% of that shit is because they rely on stupid people to read their shit and lose their minds over it. It is pure $ and every conspiracy theory should first look at where the money is. remember, if it bleeds it leads.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When he was elected, part of me was hopeful. I wanted full repeal (not replace) of the ACA, and a huge restructuring of our tax and spend policy. He seemed like a legitimate option for that. In fact, I almost voted for him because of that. However, this GOP health bill is an abortion of a bill and barely can be considered a change to Obamacare, let alone a repeal. I know it&#39;s not 100% Trumps bill, it&#39;s the house republicans. But he&#39;s running with it. And as far as spending and taxation goes? All we get is pretty much &quot;we&#39;ll, maybe next year&quot;. Seriously, republicans? You guys have the executive branch and both wings of the legislature. You guys should be mowing down regulations and taxes like an overgrown yard. I&#39;d like to blame Trump but that wouldn&#39;t be realistic. This is probably the most incompetent congress we&#39;ve ever had.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t like Trump, if I were in the US I would have probably have voted Stein. But the amount of hate spewed at this man seems really unfair and just too much. Articles have called him a bigot, racist, stupid...etc. They even attack the size of his hands, like that is something he has control over or can change. They&#39;ve attacked his wife, daughters, sons, grandchildren...I mean how do they not come off as hate mongerers?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My speculation is that it&#39;s done by globalists.</p>

<p>The liberals are actually trying to reach out to middle eastern, Chinese, and Russian youth so they can have a base population to start coups and such. </p>

<p>This has nothing to do with the US at all, dude.</p>

<p>Just think about it. Trump an incompetent dictator who is actually a puppet for a superpower (russia). Someone who is oppressive, hates gay people, hates jews, and hates women. His only interests is stripping rights off his citizens such as freedom of speech, and to steal money from US citizens. </p>

<p>The globalists manufactured this entire thing. </p>

<p>Now the military industrial complex can rise to new heights as there are pockets of youth who are brainwashed by US propaganda that are willing to riot and protest in their country, maybe even engage in civil conflict. They push for Americanism and adjust the ideals of liberal US society in their own communities. </p>

<p>If anything, the deep state as you described chose trump so they can become successful </p>

Which, hey, if people want to dig into multinational energy corporation connections and corruption more power to you. The idea that Russian spies are now controlling US policy, which yes there are certain media who are selling that idea, is incredibly idiotic on so many levels it&#39;s hard to even begin.</p>

<p>But the brainwashing machine that is mainstream media is right about one thing: we&#39;re now in a &quot;post truth era&quot; (they forget to mention it began long ago and they made it that way but that&#39;s another story). This is the key myth of the Cold War 2.0 narrative and it&#39;s here to stay for who knows how long. Now would be a good time to start analyzing the previous chapter of the Cold War and intel agencies both to better understand and before certain important information gets memory-holed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yep. &#39;Hack the election&#39; is a purposeful misnomer in order to create doubt of the validity of Trump&#39;s win in the minds of the public. Clinton was the anticipated next president since her primary loss to Obama and Donald&#39;s win upset A LOT of the globalist&#39;s plans. They are basically still running campaign smear ads and hoping something sticks. Once this charade is over I believe the special investigator will conclude that Russia favored Trump but did not influence the outcome of the election &amp; perhaps a few people in Trump&#39;s campaign may have over stepped some bounds when dealing with foreign entities but they were acting independently and not with the consent of Trump or Pence.</p>

<p>Of course if I type or say anything of the above, I must be a trump supporter, which I absolutely am not. I hate all parts of the centralized authoritarian fraud government equally, thank you.

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve got more on the economics side of the propaganda war. If I can find it, there&#39;s a white paper on the&quot;Russia hates gays&quot; narrative which actually links their policy to an attempt to economically bruise Hollywood. </p>

<p>Since the Russian anti gay law states that homosexuality can&#39;t be portrayed in public (amongst children I think,)  think of how much American media that bans. On top of that, Hollywood makes more money in the international box office than the domestic one, and Russians (it may no longer be true, the white paper is a couple years old) love Hollywood movies. </p>

<p>Of course, however, in Russia the mindset toward homosexuality is very conservative. But maybe it could also be a subtle &quot;well fuck you too,&quot; to American media. </p>

<p>The entire premise of the Russia-hysteria is that they &quot;hacked&quot; the DNC/Podesta and gave the emails to Wikileaks.</p>

<p>No, it&#39;s not. So either you are spouting off about things that you haven&#39;t bothered to understand first, or you&#39;re intentionally pushing a false narrative.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I remember seeing an interview of putin stating they caught a hacker with files from hillary&#39;s emails. This was like a year ago and I can&#39;t find the video anymore. Russia may not have hacked her email but if my memory is right they ended up with the files just the same. I also remember Julian saying how easy it would have been to hack Hillary&#39;s server. Russia may not have released anything from those documents but to say Russia had nothing to do with the hack is saying Russia isn&#39;t spying on America&#39;s politics. </p>

<p>Side note, <strong><a href="https://youtu.be/PAzvoAodmKQ">I made a video on the Trump/Russia thing as far as Podesta is concerned.</a></strong> With all the ways Podesta could have compromised himself, and if Seth Rich turns out to be the source of the other leaks, that means the entire media establishment and many senior, career politicians have been openly, and knowingly lying their asses off with regard to geopolitics with another nuclear power. They&#39;re hysterical because they&#39;d all be toast.</p>

<p>Thats not the issue Trump is facing currently. Its amazing that so many people don&#39;t know this.</p>

<p>During the campaign he and his people allegedly were in contact with Russia, and did not state they were in contact, which is illegal during the election.</p>

<p>The FBI is going after Trump and his people for this AND Trump trying to obstruct the investigation, which is a felony. That is why its big news. Obstruction of justice is worse than what Nixon did in the eyes of the courts. </p>

The level of disinformation and propaganda coming from MSM is blatantly outrageous. That the US citizenry cares more about where the MSM leads them instead of asking any questions such as why we&#39;re even in Afganistan which is the longest war in US history, or exactly how our involvement in Syria has any humanitarian effect, or why we are supporting a Saudi led war in Yemen.
I find it completely disheartening to watch the US populace be led by the pied piper like it were Nazi Germany.</p>

<p>What if he had lost to Cruz or Rubio? The emails would have been released either way.</p>

<p>The hack started in summer 2015. You are telling me Putin had the foresight to bet it all on Trump winning not only the Republican nomination but the election itself?</p>

<p>And what does &quot;collusion&quot; even mean? What, Russia needs help from the Trump campaign to hack into DNC servers? What, the Trump campaign had secret hackers somewhere?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>1) The corruption in Russian is akin to the mob era in our country. We know Putin is ruthless and a former intelligence officer. Why wouldn&#39;t the country trying to reclaim it&#39;s superpower-status try to promote someone who&#39;s loaning Russian money, rather than someone who would have increased sanctions and likely gone into Syria and Crimea for war?</p>

<p>2) The demand for evidence by this sub lately, during an ONGOING investigation, is entitled and ignorant. We still don&#39;t have evidence from JFK... </p>

<p>3) I think we are going to see evidence of voter fraud come out of this investigation. The DNC leak hurt Clinton, yes, but I think we&#39;re going to see she had suppressed votes. </p>

<p>4) The real issue here is about Clinton and the DNC overthrowing Bernie. He would have gutted Trump, got the indecisive votes and changed the US banking system and financial ties with questionable governments, in a fuckin heartbeat. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is nothing convoluted at saying the IC agencies are out to get Trump.</p>

<p>He may have conceded he thought the Russians hacked the DNC for many reasons, including trying to disassociate from that story. He changes his stance very often, so it&#39;s funny you are trying to use that as proof of something.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do you? You seem like you are clearly trying to conflate the two. What&#39;s happening right now with the FBI investigations and hearings is mostly looking at whether or not there was collusion. Your title says the Russian Hysteria is Bullshit, which presumably includes the collusion piece, but you don&#39;t mention it.</p>

<p>I think you are being a bit disingenuous here.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why why WHY in the fuck do you think <em>you</em> should have direct and unfettered access to the evidence of an ongoing investigation that very well may result in multiple counts of treason??? That is not how the world works, the way the world works is we have qualified people at the FBI and other Intel agencies who have been cleared to work on such a case who dig up this evidence, and then the mouthpieces of tbose agencies disseminate only the basics of the investigation to the public. The basics do not include the evidence they plan on using in court, and if you cannot figure out why this is, you&#39;re even worse than a shill.</p>

<p>The entire premise of the Russia-hysteria is that they &quot;hacked&quot; the DNC/Podesta and gave the emails to Wikileaks.</p>

<p>No, it&#39;s not. The investigation is about the Trump administrations ties to Russia. You&#39;re deliberately spreading the disinformation that the only premise for an investigation into Russia-Trump admin is the hacking of the DNC - and if that didn&#39;t happen then there&#39;s no basis. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>FireEye deliberately excluded many targets of APT28 for being “not particularly indicative of a specific sponsor’s interests.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Trivial stuff bro. Those cases are not as interesting or unusual as the ones examined in that particular paper. The ones examined demonstrate clearly an exclusive geopolitical agenda that is broadly consistent with only one plausible culprit: Russia. </p>

<p>That the others were excluded from this very brief outline does not detract from this premise.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>the DNC was breached by a Russian-speaking hacker who is not employed by the Russian intelligence services but has access to the APT28 malware... Or   the DNC was breached by a Russian hacker who does contract work for the FSB when he isn’t running his own hacker-for-hire business for Russian oligarchs and Swiss lawyers... Or   the DNC was breached by a Russian hacker who does contract work for the FSB when he isn’t running his own hacker-for-hire business for Russian oligarchs and Swiss lawyers...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yeah, if &lt;overly elaborate hypothesis not supported by any sound logical explanation&gt;.</p>

<p>The pattern is clear enough - the fingerprints and methods used in hacks that were almost certainly done to benefit the Russian state in its own backyard (i.e. in Georgia and Ukraine, for pro-Russian goals) were found in a prolonged cyber attack on the Democratic party in the US. That&#39;s where the evidence points <em>with the highest probability</em>, and you&#39;ve done nothing to change that fact.</p>

<p>You can bring-up &#39;Russian oligarchs&#39; and &#39;Swiss lawyers&#39; all you want ... where&#39;s <em>your</em> evidence, eh?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>To say that this is evidence which points unequivocally to the Kremlin is naive.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Who said that? The US IC concludes with &quot;high confidence&quot;, and few in the tech community view the evidence as conclusive.</p>

<p>This is a <em>theory</em>, an inference to the best explanation, based upon the available evidence of multiple independent cyber-forensic investigations, which all points in only one direction. Rather than follow the evidence where it goes, you&#39;ve decided to work backwards from your conclusion (not Russia!).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Intelligence Community says it has classified information which proves the hacking narrative, proof that is apparently unrelated to these cyber-security firms. They should present that information to the public.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Any such information would absolutely be of the very highest classification, and the NSA/CIA/etc aren&#39;t going to burn their best sources on a dangerous adversary by making it all public. Are you fucken kidding? Be reasonable man.</p>

<p>Even if they did, you wouldn&#39;t accept it anyway - you&#39;ve made that much clear. Important Republican representatives have access to this stuff, and so does the Whitehouse - Trump is the about only person in government who still doesn&#39;t seem to agree. Weird, huh?</p>
