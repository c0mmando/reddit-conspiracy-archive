    <div class="md"><p>Sounds to me like he&#39;s a fuckin&#39; hack.</p>

<p>1) Water boarding has a history of being considered torture that dates back to WWII when it was performed against American&#39;s by the Japanese.</p>

<p>2) He never recanted his position; however, Christopher Hitchens, who made the same boast (Though followed through) immediately did.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2008/08/hitchens200808">http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2008/08/hitchens200808</a></p>

<p>3) <em>Tell me how him not following through on a personal promise indicates that his actual journalism is not credible.</em></p>

<p>His journalism wasn&#39;t <em>not credible</em>, it was biased and he was being an apologist for torture. His statement that waterboarding isn&#39;t torture, <em>watch me go through it to prove it</em>, is a statement that if a pussy journalist with no SERE training can undergo it, then clearly a soldier could be expected to undergo it. He then backed down, because guess what, getting tortured to make a point is the kind of thing that people with balls do, not errant  wastes of oxygen like Sean Hannity. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re allowed to lie.</p>

<p>A spokesman says, &#39;I love milk, milk is my favorite drink.&#39; Really, he likes Hendricks and Tonic. That&#39;s a fine lie to tell.</p>

<p>Water boarding isn&#39;t torture. That&#39;s not the same kind of lie. It ended up getting repeated by right wing arm chair chicken hawks. Our military took responsibility for torture, they couldn&#39;t call it that for legal reasons, but they knew it was torture. Pretending like it wasn&#39;t torture shows he didn&#39;t understand what the lie was.</p>

<p>The actual lie was that it wasn&#39;t torture legally, no one was claiming that it wasn&#39;t torture in practice. So his crossing that line showed he just didn&#39;t get it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just wait for KDC to actually do something before you get all angst-y  about it. KDC only delayed because he was getting sworn depositions recorded with his lawyers present and all the legal channels covered. Remember that KDC is facing extradition to the US as we speak, so his lawyers are actually used to taking on the US Justice Department. He knows how to do this properly, and i&#39;d rather him get his ducks in a row than just make some stupid 4Chan post.</p>

<p>If he&#39;s released nothing by tomorrow with no reasoning or excuse, I can understand being upset about this, but the timeline hasn&#39;t even come to fruition yet. Calm down and be patient!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you&#39;ve got it, dump it, or shut the fuck up.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We saw what happened to Manning and others who &#39;just dumped it&#39; and they got arrested and pseudo-tortured for like 7 years. Greenwald would get the same treatment in a second, and then we have one less good journalist out there willing to tell &#39;the other side&#39;.</p>

<p>Why don&#39;t you feel these people should protect themselves? KDC waited for a fever pitch on Seth Rich before coming forward so that this couldn&#39;t be distracted from as easily. If he produces something of value, it was a very smart strategy.</p>

At least while I wait the State Dept just dropped like 250+ HRC emails this morning... looks like I&#39;m gonna finish going thru em before I finish my first cup of coffee though... it&#39;s just a big slog of WJC schedules all redacted to high hell... </p>

<p>I&#39;ll still sift thru em all to see if there are any pearls, but those State Dept. wonks always edit out the interesting stuff.... but at least I got something to do while I wait... Maybe I should check on the FBI Vault too... nope... nothing... but it&#39;s a little early in the AM for the FBI to drop anything... </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know much about him either. But I would find it strange if Kim wanted try to make a cheap buck off of some guy&#39;s murder. Then again, I don&#39;t know him.

I&#39;ve been let down by many people like James O&#39;keefe, but I have a feeling that kimdotcom might save us all at the last moment. </p>

<blockquote>
<h1>SETHRICH WAS A HERO</h1>

<p>I KNOW THAT SETCH RICH WAS INVOLVED IN THE DNC LEAK.
I know this because in late 2014 a person contacted me about helping me to start a branch of the Internet Party in the United States. He called himself Panda. I now know that Panda was Seth Rich.</p>

<p>Panda advised me that he was working on voter analytics tools and other technologies that the Internet Party may find helpful.</p>

<p>I communicated with Panda on a number of topics including corruption and the influence of corporate money in politics.</p>

<p>“He wanted to change that from the inside.”
I was referring to what I knew when I did an interview with Bloomberg in New Zealand in May 2015. In that interview I hinted that Julian Assange and Wikileaks would release information about Hillary Clinton in the upcoming election.</p>

<p>The Rich family has reached out to me to ask that I be sensitive to their loss in my public comments. That request is entirely reasonable.</p>

<p>I have consulted with my lawyers. I accept that my full statement should be provided to the authorities and I am prepared to do that so that there can be a full investigation. My lawyers will speak with the authorities regarding the proper process.</p>

<p>If my evidence is required to be given in the United States I would be prepared to do so if appropriate arrangements are made. I would need a guarantee from Special Counsel Mueller, on behalf of the United States, of safe passage from New Zealand to the United States and back. In the coming days we will be communicating with the appropriate authorities to make the necessary arrangements. In the meantime, I will make no further comment.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Killing time by going over the DNC lawsuit.  </p>

<p>Question:<br/>
Bruce Spiva (lawyer for the DNC) argued ... the party holds the right to select its candidate any way it chooses and is not bound by pledges of fairness.  </p>

<p>Surely you&#39;d seek a statement confirming this as <em>common knowledge</em> from the DNC&#39;s 2 biggest losers from 2016: Bernie Sanders and Tulsi Gabbard?  </p>

<p>We all know Bernie got screwed, was he ok with that? I thought he changed affiliations so he COULD challenge Clinton for the leadership role?<br/>
And did Rep Gabbard know that she was committing career suicide by dropping out of the Vice-Chair DNC position to support Bernie&#39;s run, in late February?</p>
