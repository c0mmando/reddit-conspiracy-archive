       I personally think he's unfit for the job, don't hate him as a person, since I feel all he wants to do is be liked (and make some money).
      </p>
      <p>
       That being said, I asked my father about him, and he said some thing interesting.
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically he argued that Trump is leaking out these controversies every week to distract him doing inside deals to better his personal business/brand.
      </p>
      <p>
       Dunno, found that pretty interesting, what are your thoughts about him?

       How does this make him different from the last 4? The only difference is the coverage and the confederacy of establishment powers working against him. Also thanks to Trump hysteria, the deep state started operating in the open. That was just a "conspiracy theory" until this election.

       Well, for starters, even Bush pushed some decent social programs, especially  student loan repayment. Trump's budget calls for the elimination of a lot of programs that help people out. Basically they become economic hand cuffs and it pulls monetary power, or what little there ever was, from the proles.

       Well from a business standpoint, I like how he is removing regulations, which reduce competition and cost huge amounts to monitor and enforce. TPP being gone day one was a good start, but there is still a lot more to do in that arena. I also like the rule "for every new regulation you have to remove two existing ones". Regulations have been weaponized by lobbyists primarily against smaller local competitors, and creates an unreasonably high bar of entry for smaller businesses to enter an industry, let alone compete.
      </p>

       The warmonger liberals are the ones that strike me as one of the oddest about face turns I can remember. Most of them are politicians and media who are using the stance for political expedience, but some of the normal people who trust the media go along.

       That is funny because I remember him saying that EVERYONE would have their taxes cut to encourage repatriation of funds that have been locked outside the US. The catch would be that he might cut the higher brackets less than the lower ones.

       The biggest loophole for the rich isn't with income taxes though. It is capital gains. If you want to focus on the 1 or 2%, that is where you should focus. Most rich people don't actually work to maintain their wealth, so this is often used as a misdirection. Returns on investments it the actual way the rich stay rich.

       He isn't even hiding his business dealings.  It's blatant and his supporters don't care. Meanwhile Obama recently gave a speech and got paid for it, and everyone is criticizing him for it even though he isn't in office anymore. I don't get it.

       Do tell, what are some of the things that make him comparable to JFK. I bet if I told you that Jimmy Carter was non-establishment, you'd tell me I was crazy. they smeared him to get Reagan in there because Reagan would do everything he could to kill off minorities and start a war not only on people with dark skin, but the middle class, creating inflation and crushing the hopes and dreams of hundreds of millions before they were even born.

       Affordable health care for all, with a system better than the aca in how long did he say? I don't remember but his deadlines up.

       Draining the swamp?

       Literally the only thing hes kept his promise on is backing out of the tpp,  he's done nothing of what he said other than back up the fact that he's not fit to be president.  Just because he ran with an r next to his name doesn't mean you have to swallow his shit and say he's feeding you chocolate.

       Trump is not losing money.
      </p>
      <p>
       He's saving money at this point, there's even been government funded advertising for his properties pushed through other governments. Not to mention whatever money he borrowed/was donated to him that are now being paid back by being in office with political favors.
      </p>
      <p>
       He also can't actually refuse the salary, he could donate it, but he wouldn't ever show proof of that, he'd just give you his word, which is only believed by a small number of gullible people.

       Just because he ran as a Republican doesn't mean you have to close your eyes to his bullshit. And don't let his pairing with pence trick you into believing he has any of those "Christian morals," everybody always talks about.

       He's funny...    I love the character.  Not so big on the Presidential version of him though, but I don't think he's nearly as bad as people make him out to be.

       They elected a businessman to the Presidency, why anyone was surprised he put other successful business types in his cabinet is hilarious to me.  Why anyone thinks he's going to be different then others is crazy too. The Presidency is like handling a business and that's what he's doing.    I don't agree with a lot he has tried to do or did do, or the apparent collusion with Russia....

       If he's guilty of a real crime then he should pay the penalty.    But if he didn't do anything, hopefully he can just try and do a better job and earn the respect of those who don't like him

       As someone who will lose healthcare and a program I planned on using when getting my masters degree, I couldn't care less how the rich get rich. I care about the proles getting equal footing.

       I don't have a grasp on economics, so I'm not even going to front. Let's call it a wash. You like his ideas, I think they are poison and establishment, just like the rest.
