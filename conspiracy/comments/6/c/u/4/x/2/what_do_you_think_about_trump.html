<p>Basically he argued that Trump is leaking out these controversies every week to distract him doing inside deals to better his personal business/brand.</p>

<p>Dunno, found that pretty interesting, what are your thoughts about him?</p>

<p>How does this make him different from the last 4? The only difference is the coverage and the confederacy of establishment powers working against him. Also thanks to Trump hysteria, the deep state started operating in the open. That was just a &quot;conspiracy theory&quot; until this election.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, for starters, even Bush pushed some decent social programs, especially  student loan repayment. Trump&#39;s budget calls for the elimination of a lot of programs that help people out. Basically they become economic hand cuffs and it pulls monetary power, or what little there ever was, from the proles. </p>

<p>That said, you have liberals cheering on the FBI, which is just crazy. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well from a business standpoint, I like how he is removing regulations, which reduce competition and cost huge amounts to monitor and enforce. TPP being gone day one was a good start, but there is still a lot more to do in that arena. I also like the rule &quot;for every new regulation you have to remove two existing ones&quot;. Regulations have been weaponized by lobbyists primarily against smaller local competitors, and creates an unreasonably high bar of entry for smaller businesses to enter an industry, let alone compete.</p>

<p>The warmonger liberals are the ones that strike me as one of the oddest about face turns I can remember. Most of them are politicians and media who are using the stance for political expedience, but some of the normal people who trust the media go along. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is funny because I remember him saying that EVERYONE would have their taxes cut to encourage repatriation of funds that have been locked outside the US. The catch would be that he might cut the higher brackets less than the lower ones. </p>

<p>The biggest loophole for the rich isn&#39;t with income taxes though. It is capital gains. If you want to focus on the 1 or 2%, that is where you should focus. Most rich people don&#39;t actually work to maintain their wealth, so this is often used as a misdirection. Returns on investments it the actual way the rich stay rich.</p>

I bet if I told you that Jimmy Carter was non-establishment, you&#39;d tell me I was crazy. they smeared him to get Reagan in there because Reagan would do everything he could to kill off minorities and start a war not only on people with dark skin, but the middle class, creating inflation and crushing the hopes and dreams of hundreds of millions before they were even born. </p>

<p>Draining the swamp?</p>

<p>Literally the only thing hes kept his promise on is backing out of the tpp,  he&#39;s done nothing of what he said other than back up the fact that he&#39;s not fit to be president.

<p>You don&#39;t think with the entire country viewing his ass under a microscope (with headlines of him putting ketchup on his steak, getting two scoops etc.) that he would even attempt these?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Trump is not losing money.</p>

<p>He&#39;s saving money at this point, there&#39;s even been government funded advertising for his properties pushed through other governments. Not to mention whatever money he borrowed/was donated to him that are now being paid back by being in office with political favors.</p>

<p>He also can&#39;t actually refuse the salary, he could donate it, but he wouldn&#39;t ever show proof of that, he&#39;d just give you his word, which is only believed by a small number of gullible people.</p>

<p>And Ivanka may have lost some sales through certain department stores, but she sure is fuck isn&#39;t losing more than she&#39;s making, especially after being granted a Chinese trademark after a government meeting, plus whatever she gets out of her new government job,</p>

<p>Just because he ran as a Republican doesn&#39;t mean you have to close your eyes to his bullshit. And don&#39;t let his pairing with pence trick you into believing he has any of those &quot;Christian morals,&quot; everybody always talks about.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He&#39;s funny...    I love the character.  Not so big on the Presidential version of him though, but I don&#39;t think he&#39;s nearly as bad as people make him out to be.</p>

<p>They elected a businessman to the Presidency, why anyone was surprised he put other successful business types in his cabinet is hilarious to me.  Why anyone thinks he&#39;s going to be different then others is crazy too. The Presidency is like handling a business and that&#39;s what he&#39;s doing.    I don&#39;t agree with a lot he has tried to do or did do, or the apparent collusion with Russia....    </p>

<p>If he&#39;s guilty of a real crime then he should pay the penalty.    But if he didn&#39;t do anything, hopefully he can just try and do a better job and earn the respect of those who don&#39;t like him </p>
