      <p>
       The younger generations have been brainwashed completely:-
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         the younger generations protest on behalf of the elites. By and large, the younger generations are pro-mass immigration, pro-bloated welfare state, pro-megacorps (they give a pass to Apple, Google and Facebook paying so little in taxes).  These companies work with the deep state (ARE the deep state) that spy on your every action online.  It's been documented and made fact that this happens (PRISM).  Younger generations: "no problem!".  Everything here is pro-uniparty/deep state agenda!
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         the younger generations have swallowed the lie that there's a difference between one political party and another one.  They all vote for the uniparty, and argue amongst themselves.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         they do NOT protest about high house prices, crappy wages, nor the enormous national debts being piled up (e.g. US has $20,000,000,000,000 in national debt, of which in 8 short years Obama added another $10,000,000,000,000) - yet these are massive issues that affect, and will affect, the younger generations significantly.  The older generations are robbing the young blind - all over the western world - with nary a protest from the young.  Stunningly successful brainwashing right there.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         the younger generations have been successfully cowed by political correctness.  This is a key aspect to the brainwashing strategy.  If you are scared to voice any kind of dissenting opinion to the MSM favoured narrative, then you will be shamed.  Look at how youtube give a pass to SJW-type channels, but anything non-PC is demonetised as "racist" or "sexist" (definitions that are subject to change on a daily basis).
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         the younger generations feel it's a "safe haven" to have a liberal (in the modern sense of the word, not dictionary definition sense) outlook: they follow the idea that we have an unlimited number of sexes (not binary), they are anti-traditional family (it's patriarchal after all, right?), pro-modern feminist - all the templated ideas that universities churn out are swalled wholesale by younger generations without any scrutiny (they don't want to be shamed).
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Good job deep state. You really did it.  You have an army of useful idiots to do your dirty work.  They will argue amongst themselves, while ALL of them defend the status quo, and NONE protest real issues that affect them.  Bravo.
      </p>
      <p>
       Before anyone comments, the above is a generalisation.  Please don't give me personal anecdotes about how you are young and see through all the propaganda.  I get it.  I'm talking about the masses of younger generations who don't see through it. If I'm wrong, where are the protests about a falling standard of living, high house prices, national debt?

       It's not about hating migrants, but I'm more of the fact that they should stay and fight for their country instead of running away, I don't completely blame them for looking for opportunities elsewhere, but since they don't assimilate their host nations the end result is conflict.

       Keep in mind I'm not pro mass immigration either. But I don't hate the immigrants right now it's a issue cuz so many countries are destabilized.
      </p>
      <p>
       For instance under Gaddafi Polish people would immigrate to Libya now people from Libya are going to Europe. None of that would've happened if Gaddafi wasn't killed. How am I going to be angry at Libyan people for leaving their homes because their country was destroyed?

       I'm not sure the millennials are as pro-corporate as everyone thinks.  Most of them don't even want to work.  Gen-X is the one pushing the idea that we should all slave over a job we hate.  Millennials are being mind-controlled by apps, games and social media.  But I tell, most millennials I know just don't care about government.  They hate both R &amp; D parties

       How about find a job that you like? Make a job that you like? I think that if people started trying to find value in what they create and produce instead of what kind of crap they 'fight for' or accumulate the world would be a better place. This whole "it's either work a shitty job or don't work" is nonsense. If people spent more time bettering themselves and finding out what THEY are interested in, they wouldn't feel the need to spend their time 'bettering others', virtue signaling, and telling other people what 'really matters'. I've worked a load of crap jobs, but then I started finding things that interested me and now I do something that is fun, challenging, and gives me the opportunity to propose better ways of doing things. Hating R or D doesn't stop someone from hating themselves.

       Why not blame Free Press for break down of traditional culture?. Why the CIA??. the internet gives free critical opinion about any ideology imaginable..it undermines  traditions and authority..this never used to be the case.
Why does high debt and falling wages have to be an evil intentional pre planned conspiracy by the "elitists" ...maybe just maybe just maybe stuff like that is unintentional and managed as well as possible by smart people with good intentions.

       Yeah and I suppose that inmigration laws, Feminism, Homosexuality, the fact of the US's huge debt, the murder of JFK for wanting to abolish the FR and the constant wars and further inmigration are all for the interest of the people.

       I'm not saying that high debt and falling wages is the conspiracy. It's  that the establishment misdirect the younger generations into not caring about these issues - THAT is the conspiracy. They're more bothered about gender-neutral toilets than being able to afford a home - according to how they protest.

       In a way yes, I do look for deals.  The best deal for all involved.  I shop local, whenever possible, but lately that has gotten harder.   Our locally owned supermarket and electronic parts stores just closed.  Still have a hardware store and a pet store and a butcher.  The prices seem fair enough.

       I disagree. I see them having a very strong, anti-authoritarian sub-culture to them. Remember, these kids have had google since they were 10.
      </p>
      <p>
       With that said, I think there is definitely a type of kid who fits the portrait you are painting. I think there are definitely those types being bred in certain areas (academia, etc.) but I think they are the minority in number. It's hard to really know where the macro numbers lie tho, so I do understand your point and I'm not saying you or I are any more right than another. It's something we really can't know, but I feel I see a lot of the youth just unwilling to even play the game....

       I think they see protests as opportunities to be ID'd and I don' t think they see them as useful or productive. They're not stupid.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why do you think they move to things like Snapchat rather than facebook or twitter? They get this stuff better than the older generations do. The real protesters are 4chan hackers and red-pilling youtubers and such. Traditional protesting is literally a sheep behavior (the animal... you're basically herding yourself for the authorities)

      <p>
       Occupy Wall St was a protest against an obvious "bogeyman" (rich bankers).
      </p>
      <p>
       They still voted for the EU over in Europe - which is absolutely, 100% a pro-establishment organization that is screwing over the young via mass immigration flattening wages and putting pressure on house prices.  Again, PCness stopped the young from scrutinizing their real choices on the matter.  Instead, Brexiteers are "racists".
      </p>
      <p>
       The young still blindly hate Trump even though he's just a puppet.  They can't see beyond two parties.

       That makes me sad. There were massive protests -- the media just blacked them out just like they blacked out the rest of the story. I thought people here would know better.

       The central demand of OWS was actually the excessive influence of money in politics. Which IMO is the root cause of most of what's wrong with US government. They did focus in particular on the banks, but remember, this was at the height of the recession the bankers brought on -- pretty damn justified.

       Re: Brexit, the young people I know who voted remain were primarily worried about the work opportunities it would cut them off from early in their careers, vs. the old people whose careers were already established and not so threatened by being cut off from the EU. You can disagree with it being in their best interest overall, but it's a reasonable position to not want to vote your way out of a large proportion of your potential job opportunities in an economy this uncertain. (Same applies to Le Pen in France).

       Occupy? Anonymous?

       Millennial here, some of my friends are idiots and fit your description, but those who know better don't show up in a public place and show their face and protest like previous generations. This is why there are movements like Anonymous and unfortunately Antifa.
      </p>
      <p>
       Take Occupy for example, once they gained enough power the Feds identified the leaders and arrested them all. They did the same to Anonymous. Once you've been unmasked they just throw you in jail.

       We grew up under surveillance, they've been watching, testing us, brainwashing us, and thinning the herd since we were children.
      </p>
      <p>
       So we found new ways to subvert the system: cryptocurrencies, the legality of cannabis, hacking, leaking, and whistleblowing.

      <p>
       We are Edward Snowden, Manning, and Seth Rich.

       Arguably we've exposed more treason than any other generation in history before us, and we're just getting started.

       Considering Snowden is stuck in Russia, and Seth Rich is dead I don't really think this is what the Deep State intended. Meanwhile Manning spent 7-years in prison and was likely MKultraed. They were whistleblowers, and in Seth Rich's case they made an example of him, and they're still punishing Snowden by not letting him come home and face a fair trial.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not everything is a psyop.
      </p>
      <p>
       While I do agree the Deep State tries to vilify whistleblowers, and spin their leaks to benefit the NWO theres plenty of people who don't buy their narratives.

       OK, let's talk about the masses.
      </p>
      <p>
       In 2016, Americans didn't just have to choose between Democrat and Republican. If they were resolved to vote against the corrupt status quo (built by older generations), they then had the choice between an unstable billionaire who opportunistically scapegoats minorities and doesn't understand basic civics, or the first high-profile politician to clearly spell out to the public exactly how the wealthy have been screwing them over -- no BS, no gimmicks, just calling out the broken, exploitative system in a way that was unprecedented at that level of politics. Which demographic
       <em>
        overwhelmingly
       </em>
       went for the latter? Young people. The kids are all right.
      </p>
      <p>
       Political correctness isn't the story. It's one of the many distractions from the main stories that really matter -- economic and foreign policy.  They keep using so-called "identity politics" as wedge issues. You'd think we could all just agree by now on equality and mutual respect for all, and then focus on things that actually matter instead of falling for asinine artificial conflicts based on superficialities. But a lot of people can't see through the unnecessarily divisive propaganda and insist on being assholes to each other for no good reason. Go figure - that problem seems to be more common among older generations.

       Umm...you must be alluding to Bernie Sanders, right? He wasn't the candidate picked by the Dems.  If you are talking about Hilary Clinton - are you
       <em>
        kidding
       </em>
       me? You're saying Hilary Clinton - a carved in stone establishment figure - part of the political dynasty, who was obviously central to the corrupt DNS candidate rigging scandal to get her to run for presidency -
       <em>
        she
       </em>
       is somehow believed when she says she's against a "broken, exploitative system"? She benefited from such a system.  She's right up there as one of the most corrupt politicians to walk this earth.  You're holding up the idea that the young voted for her as a good example of how they young are not brainwashed? You've just made the polar opposite point.
      </p>
      <p>
       And also - you make my point that everyone votes for the uniparty.  The young have been successfully "played" if they think voting R or D makes a difference.  They get screwed over by either.  Because they're just different coloured labels on a wine bottle - same wine inside.

       PC is the tool used regarding everything you describe above.  PC is a part of identity politics.  In this world of PC, you are your skin colour, you are your sex.  It's the opposite of skin and sex blindness.  PC judges everybody by their skin colour and sex in an incendiary way.  We judge what people say in context to their skin colour and sex, the actual content matters a lot less.

       Yeah, Sanders. I was referring to 2016 more broadly, extending to the primaries, when young people overwhelmingly supported Bernie Sanders by ridiculous margins. Then they got screwed by the DNC, and many stayed home in November, voted third party, or else held their noses and voted for one of the unprecedentedly terrible candidates nominated by a major party.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Republican/Democratic binary enforced by the current system is a sad reality that most young people despise. I know many who are actively fighting to change it. Older people I know are much more likely to be lifelong party loyalists. Young people are more likely to grudgingly vote within-party because they feel trapped by the garbage system they're inheriting from their elders.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's something I really want you to think about in terms of "PC". We're agreed that shallow it's misdirection. And it comes from both/all sides to a considerable degree. But there's a lot of right-wing propaganda railing
       <em>
        against
       </em>
       "political correctness" that turns being an asshole to members of marginalized groups and maintaining pointless, divisive injustices into a political statement. It's not productive.

       Fair enough - I really thought you MUST have been talking about Sanders (will strike through my Hilary rant!).

      <p>
       I get your point on the young being disaffected.  I just wish they would be galvanized to protest against the establishment as they did when Trump got in.  He was the bogeyman.  Are social media platforms censoring anti-establishment voices? I'm not seeing these nearly as much as anti-Trump or anti-Clinton commentary at the time of the election.  There needs to be a true anti-establishment movement against the political apparatus.
      </p>
      <p>
       I totally agree with you that the older generations are embedded into the system and will vote on party lines (I'm 45 by the way).  I just think they are the beneficiaries of this sytem and the younger generations are picking up the tab.

       Well, part of the problem is that the media doesn't cover anti-establishment protests. It's pretty safe to bet that if it's against the establishments' collective interest, it's not going to get much air time.  And when it does, you get ridiculousness like this:
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R00Zl6hrDu0">
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R00Zl6hrDu0
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       And yes, social media censorship seems to be happening. I've only twice ever had facebook give me a weird error where it wouldn't post a perfectly valid URL. Both were things very harsh challenges to the dominant narrative du jour. Creeps me out.

       AND 'social media' keeps them well corralled

       separated at the same time --- so

        they think

       they are "close" to their friends BUT
      </p>
      <p>
       e.g. ask a millenial "when was the last time you had a D&amp;M conversation with a friend about your life in general

      <p>
       You'll probably get a blank stare!

       One of my friends who has a small company said to me about the "Y gens" -- "they are the most unreliable groupp of people I have employed, I call them the "Y

       You are wrong here.
      </p>
      <p>
       The younger generations have not been brainwashed at all. It is highly dependent on what state you live in and also it seems the 40-55 range are the ones that are the most brainwashed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most young people are fearful of losing their jobs and careers and its just easier to conform than to challenge. the 40-55 age range are the ones that the brainwashing is instilled in their up bringing.
      </p>
      <p>
       For me a simple test on how brainwashed a person is is ask them their real thoughts on 9/11.
      </p>
      <p>
       Someone who has the capability of critical thinking will answer this question at the very least as " Yeah im not sure it was an inside job but they are definitely not telling us the whole story because certain things do not add up."
      </p>
      <p>
       I dont expect everyone around me to understand the complexities of all that is going on in the world but the 9/11 story for me is the dealbreaker for the ability to critically think.

       My point was that the younger generations are being robbed blind and accepting it.  They're told that everything is OK - look how cool tech is these days, you're lucky to be living in this age.  Then they go out to work and need two salaries to pay off a mortgage, 6 figures of debt to get an education.  This is progress?

       Beyond that, they moved the goalposts (diplomas are no longer good enough, now you need a degree) and made it so that the last twenty yards costs you several years of your young life to pay back (student loan debt). Debt slaves don't have time, resources, or energy to reflect or revolt.

       I know a guy who whole heartedly believes basically every bit of mainstream politics and meanwhile says "he does not want to be a politician, he perfers to be an activist". An activist in my eyes is someone who raises awareness to issues being ignored, yet his definition of an activist is someone who promotes the policies that are destroying the world, apparently.

       Not ageism.  It's making a distinction between the older generations robbing the younger ones.  My point is very unflattering to the older generations, and it's trying to make younger people see how badly they've been robbed.

       As a Millennial myself, I tend to not agree with most of what is said in this thread. We tend to feel that the older generations have fucked up. We weren't around when the deep state took control. When TPTB took over cable media. We weren't around when the foundations of what would become the Patriot Act were laid down. We weren't around during the Red Scare - but we can read about it and Google anything we want.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why are we the 'brainwashed' ones and not those that never grew up without internet and swallowed everything cable media or the church tole them?
      </p>
      <p>
       Why aren't we out on the streets protesting? Because we see the establishment is the only thing we have. I read all the time here that people hate on international institutions like the EU and can't understand why someone like Macron was voted in. Well, I do. It means security, stability and peace. Yes, there are many problems to address, but was is the other option? Taking the whole system down? Hell the F no. Name me one country that rejected the global system and fared well after. We understand that we need to fix the institutions from within, not take them down wholly. We are very aware of who is actually in control, and how fragile the system is. But at the end of the day, the system works for both elite and us 'slaves'.
      </p>
      <p>
       The western Millennials realize how spoiled, self-absorbed and unsustainable the generation before them has been. That is why low-eco footprint and anti-materialism have become a thing (yes, the Left is pushing it too far). But we realize that 80% of the world is worse off than us, partly because of the generations before us.
      </p>
      <p>
       We have read about your Vietnam and Korea wars, your sponsorship and reliance on oil economies, your CO2 emissions, your plastic, your Big Pharma, your tobacco, your Western Arrogance, your maximizing of credit cards, your white nationalism, your regional rivalry, your colonialism, your support of dictators, constant fighting between left and right..... NO THANK YOU. How dare you call a generation brainwashed when we are all just too numb from needing to clean up your shit to actually go go out and carry a protest sign? Of course we'd rather click a 'like' button after spending a day in school / college learning about the broken system that was left for us to fix.

       Because it's you guys who are being robbed and you don't even know it.  You've been robbed of a decent future.  You guys need two salaries to pay off a mortgage.  You need 5 or 6 figures of debt to get an education.  You have inherited $20Tn of debt in the US, nearly £2Tn of debt in the UK - both national debts have exploded in the last 10 years.  Your economic outlook is utterly shit for decades ahead.  I'm not saying the older generations didn't get brainwashed, but they did have a higher standard of living (which is perverse, things should be getting better, not worse).

TBTB are scared of the younger generations organizing in this way.  You might laugh at my suggestions, but they are easy for each individual to do, and have a big impact on how we can reject media channels collectively.  Reject useless university degrees.

Instead, all I see are people defending the status quo and saying things are good now, the EU is OK, the western governments are OK, globalisation is OK - everything's OK.  You can't hold both positions.  You can't accept that you've been robbed of ambition and been given a huge bill, and that that is OK.

       I don't know how old you are, but my perspective is in seeing a huge fall in the standard of living (I'm 45 by the way).  I can see how much debt has been piled onto the shoulders of the young.  I can see their wages have been suppressed to the point that life is no longer about amibtion, but about survival.  Two wage families to merely survive.
      </p>
      <p>
       The sanguine responses from younger people in this thread kind of make my point for me.  It's like "hey, it's OK, life's good, and you know, we do protest, we just do youtube videos instead of taking to the streets".  Good luck with that.  Your future.  I live in a mortgage free house, paid for by one salary.  That's how precipitous the fall in the standard of living has been.  You guys deserve the same.  You're not getting it, and you're OK with that?

       I agree with you.  You're not seeing a trend here? My dad got a fantastic retirement package.  His generation did really well.  I'll not get anything like the pension their generation did.  This trend has hit a point where I can see younger generations are flat-out being denied true opportunities to succeed.  Saying "things are cool" isn't helping them.

       Own land, live in an RV. Solid savings across diverse assets that is growing. Aside from the board getting reset I'll probably be in your general situation at your age. Not gonna get a mortgage, don't feel like paying interest. Might build, might stay mobile, probably both.

       The US population has more than doubled in the last fifty years, with that population concentrating more densely than ever. If you're thinking and don't have to have a new shiny every other day there's no excuse for not living well. We actually live in a post scarcity world in the west, we're throwing food away, have more empty houses than homeless people. Debt is a joke, the systems that are showing their age are being replaced with market solutions.

       This is definitely part of the problem the younger generations are facing.  Your currencies (and wages) have been devalued, assets inflated.  Western governments can't afford to pay their own bills and borrow money that YOU are paying back and will be forced to pay back for decades to come.  Money that could have been spent on infrastructure and health is lost into the blackhole of interest repayments on the exploding national debt.

       Political correctness is about controlling what people say through shame.  Someone who says "women are inferior to men" or "blacks are dumber than whites" have no shame to begin with.  People who say "hey, you know, the wage gap doesn't exist comparing like-for-like jobs, it's only when you aggregate earnings between the sexes that you see a wage gap" - that kind of statement is shamed out of existence by the "thought police" of political correctness - they shame the person with an insinuation of sexism - even though there is ZERO sexism in such a comment.  OR, someone says "interesting that there is such a diversity of average IQ levels from country to country" - this is a FACT, but someone praticising political correctness will shame the person by calling them a racist, even though that person is just stating a fact.  We should be free to speak factually without being shamed.

       So you reveal yourself as someone so scared to have an opinion that veers off the
       <em>
        current
       </em>
       , accepted politically correct view, that you can't accept distinct characteristics in human beings, based on genetics? This is a perverse and twisted view of equality - that we must have the same characteristics - we must literally be equal in our genetics.  Forget about equality of opportunity, no - we must physically be equal.  And if anyone suggests that there are differences in intelligence, height, hair colour, eye colour - you get to dumbly virtue signal and say "racist".
      </p>
      <p>
       So let me be clear: you do NOT accept that the human race consists of groups of people with varying characteristics based on genetics, including levels of intelligence? Yes or no would suffice, but feel free to elaborate on why you "believe" (not know) what you believe.
      </p>
      <p>
       You do accept that there are differences in intelligence from
       <strong>
        person to person
       </strong>
       , right? That intelligence is as influenced by genes as how tall you will grow? That there are genetic similiarities in localities (countries, groups of countries) - such as Scandanvians having lighter hair and eye colour - you'd go along with that, right? Because so far, it's not "racist" because eye colour doesn't matter - so that's "okay" for you.  You would accept there are differences in intelligence from person to person, not region to region - that's "racist" (even if technically, we're not necessarily distinguishing between races here, but regions of the world).
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        How European culture is the only real culture or civilization is it going to be more pseudoscience opinionated bullshit that is clearly based in racism?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Ah, yes - the white man is a racist argument.  Ironically, such an argument can never see its own inherent racism.  Not sure why you mentioned that statement, but you tie it up into differences in IQ, I guess? Yes, the IQ map - it must be the white man trying to prove his superiority - that would be where the "racism" lies.  The white man proving his dominance in intelligence.  Oh, except one thing. It's Asian regions that are deemed the most intelligent if we are to accept these standardised tests of intelligence.  So, what gives here? How can  white men score such a spectacular own goal by deciding that 2.5Bn+ people are more intelligent than their own genetic background? Or was it Asian researchers who decided that? No it can't be - Asians can't be racists (I'm just going along with your thinking) - maybe....it is what it is? Maybe there are differences in intelligence from region to region based on a standardised test.  "It must be cultural".  Well, then - Asian cultures are better suited to the IQ test - better than old whitey, who's a good 6 to 8 IQ points behind the best of the Asians - on average.

       Wowie you wrote a lot.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'll try to keep this brief as to not end up in a wall of text discussion. IQ based off race isn't racist in itself but it almost doesn't prove anything since there's a lot more factors to consider than just race when you go from a war torn country in Africa where survival is the only thing that matters to a country like China where education is considered extremely important.
      </p>
      <p>
       Who cares what the tests say even though they actually say Jews not Asians are at the top of that test. It doesn't prove anything because there's so many factors to consider in that. Also I'm not even doubting that some races may be smarter than others (in some things) what I'm doubting is the IQ test itself, IQ measures intelligence but I doubt it can measure all forms of intelligence and different types of intelligences are all crucial. For example I'm great at programming and absolute dog shit when it comes to mechanical abilities.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I'm a smart programmer and make more money than the mechanic, does that mean I'm smarter than him or is he smarter than me? We both need each other to make the machine run ultimately but let's sit there and figure out which one of us is more important.
      </p>
      <p>
       And he'll have his version of an IQ test and I'll have mine and both will say we're smarter than the other. That's pretty much how I see IQ and the tests. No shit Africans are going to score low on it, the society itself is barely alive due to a variety of reasons.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another reason I can't believe IQ tests is because history says otherwise, I'll be opening up a can of worms here but during the Islamic Golden Age it was the Arabs and Persians who were inventing everything under the moon from 800 to 1300 AD not Europeans. But they're considered today by this IQ map as some of the dumbest people in the world,yrt back them they were much smarter than the Europeans having all the leading Universities in the world such as in Baghdad and Alexandria, the race of people hasn't changed dramatically you can argue the Greeks and Romans did that. But even Greece is a shithole now and the race is still pretty much the same. This again further proves why IQ tests especially those based off race are complete trash.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not that a complete moron I don't doubt that there are predispositions to certain type of intelligences based off genetics. And those genetics are going to be rooted in the race of individual or group. However those predispositions might only bloom if the correct environment is allowed for it and if not they will more than likely be stunted.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can take a kid with an IQ of 200 and throw him with the Aborigines to be raised you think that kids high IQ will matter in 20 years? No he'll be too dumb to figure out how to use a smartphone and have way too much catch up to do for any of those fancy IQ points to matter.
      </p>
      <p>
       Environment matters, power matters, history matters. You can't seriously look at the map of today and just say oh it's because the white race is superior and not know history because 400 years ago it was the Ottoman Empire that was the superpower of the world and FYI they aren't Anglo-Saxon, Jewish or Mongolian. Yet they were the first peoples to fire cannons and use gun powder as weapons. So yes there are differences in races but races can get stunted or grow depending on the environmental factors there is no one true superior race.

       OK, the blank slate theory right off the bat. You completely dismiss the idea that intelligence is largely genetic (without bringing forward any evidence), but instead it's simply how well educated you are.  This is laughably simplistic and plain wrong.  We can see this in intelligence differences
       <em>
        from person to person
       </em>
       with the very same educational / experience backgrounds.  Actually, heritability of intelligence rises to 0.75 in adults.  To be clear, intelligence is 75% influenced by genetics, NOT environment -
       <a href="http://www.unc.edu/%7Enielsen/soci850/odocs/apa_01.htm">
        source
       </a>
       .  If you are right, then we would see a much more uniform level of intelligence dependent on what class of society you belong to and "what you learnt at school".  IQ is not meant to be measure "what you learnt at school", but raw intelligence.  In reality, intelligence is a bell curve distribution regardless of educational background.  Actually, there's a difference between men and women in that men have a "flatter" bell curve (more men at the extremes of intelligence) than women's distribution of intelligence.

       You don't understand the purpose of IQ.  You're confusing it with rote learning.  Rote learning has far more to do with the ability to remember things than raw intelligence.   Raw intelligence is much more initiative-based than that.  Raw intelligence finds patterns and rules without being told what they are.   Also realise that you're putting yourself in the authorative position of knowing more about measuring intelligence than the collective works of many people who've spent decades studying and measuring human intelligence.

      <p>
       You're confusing the application of intelligence with raw intelligence.   You're also applying an arbitrary and emotional aspect to all of this ("importance").  This is like saying "so what if people have varying heights, are we suggesting shorter people are less impotrant than taller people?" - it's a specious and irrelevant point - a weak appeal to emotion as if to say "finding differences is bad - it upsets people!".

       The points above completely forgo intelligence distribution amongst groups of people.  It only takes a handful of very intelligent people to shape a society in one way or another.   Your above examples don't allude to an overall high level of raw intelligence amongst an entire group of people - they show that a small number of people shaped those societies in a very enlightening way.  No different to our own technological progress in the west.  Take away Einstein, Newton, Tesla, Bell, Edison etc - where would we be? Do those geniuses make us geniuses? Of course not.  Bell curve and all that. Maybe other individuals could have filled their boots if those aforementioned geniuses did not exist, but we might be 10 or 20 years' behind where we are now in technological advancements.  Conversely, those with stunningly high levels of raw intelligence who never
       <em>
        realised
       </em>
       that intelligence - that lack of realisation of such intelligence has stopped us progressing even faster than we are doing right now.

       A separate point to my central  argument regarding genetically influenced IQ differences from region to region, but nonetheless I totally agree with you.  Your usefulness is down to how well you can interact with your environment.  No argument there.

      <p>
       Why are you saying "oh it's because the white race is superior"? That point was never made.  It's Asian countries that by-and-large (if we're going to talk about race) have the highest IQ averages.  That negates the "IQ scores are there to make whites look good" argument.

      <p>
       Again, you fail to understand intelligence distribution.  It only takes a handful of people to shape a country in one way or another.  North Korea scores very highly on IQ - you think that matters to the average individual there? Same with previous empires both good and bad - they're shaped by a small number of people in good and bad ways.

      <p>
       I'll just finish with the fact that intelligence in adults has a heritability score of .75.  Yes, environmental factors CAN shape intelligence, and certainly promote and extinguish underlying intelligence, but it's a much smaller influence than genetics.

       It's quite simple: They're fully entertained and their lives have been pretty cushy &amp; joyful.
       <br/>
       They figure the people in power can't be all that bad if they're able to live such lives. They figure they're probably just the 'decent, democratically elected' people they learned about in school.
       <br/>
       What they don't know is that it's all going to change as soon as the psychopaths in power finish conquering the globe, and they no longer need to keep us placated; they no longer need to maintain any illusion of freedom or decency.

       Having been born in the '50s, I have a perspective that most of this sub lacks.  Here is a truth that the mainstream media will never tell you.
      </p>
      <p>
       Life was
       <strong>
        so much better
       </strong>
       for almost everyone in the 50s, 60s, and 70s.  People got together face to face constantly, at parties, chatting over the garden fence, playing sports and taking trips.  Getting a job was not hard, and you didn't have to work like a fiend to keep it.  Most women had no work other than home and family and that meant that when husbands came home they could relax; the chores were done.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's the dirty secret feminists don't want you to know:  Women did not feel oppressed by this situation.  They had time to spend with their children, time to get enough sleep and prepare nutritious meals, time to plan parties and time to put their feet up and read a good book.  They were not moaning and wishing to spend their entire day alone in a windowless cubicle while someone else watched their children.
      </p>
      <p>
       Obesity was so rare that the circus sideshow had a "fat man."  That "fat man" can now be seen a dozen times a day walking down any city street.  Food was much more natural, GMOs didn't exist, kids weren't pumped full of vaccines.
      </p>
      <p>
       But how about blacks, you ask?  Many, many fewer of them were in prison.
      </p>
      <p>
       Life is not getting better.  The more the tentacles of the global domination agenda strangle society, the worse things get.  It cannot be otherwise.

       Wow, your post made me laugh out loud. Gee, I wonder if you're a straight white man?
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't feel like typing forever to disprove everything you wrote so I'll just state the ones most relevant to me:
      </p>
      <p>
       Women didn't have reproductive freedom. Women couldn't open a bank account or start a business. Women couldn't attend elite universities. Women could be fired for getting pregnant. Women couldn't be a lawyer. Women couldn't run in the Boston Marathon. Marital rape was legal. Domestic violence was ignored.
      </p>
      <p>
       Please try to defend any if this. Then try to tell us Blacks were happier oppressed, and gay people were happier in the closet.

       I was born in 1972, and have seen a similar big fall in the standard of living, albeit from a slightly later viewpoint.
      </p>
      <p>
       All of your points are exactly what I've witnessed growing up in the UK - I think it's the same all over the western world. The young of today are being cheated and they don't even TRULY realise it.  If they did, they would flat-out reject this system.  As it is, they are not doing that - they're just toeing the line, and that's why I entitled this thread as I did.  Young people have been robbed of ambition.  Now it's all about surviving on two wages to pay the mortgage, wraparound child care, crap wages, humoungous national debts that will pin down generations into a non-ambitious, "surviving" life without ambition.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's honestly depressing how the young are not really seeing it, or are saying "we're already protesting".  It's their future. I wish them the best.

       Yes, there is a major propaganda push to convince young people that the past sucked and things are getting better.  In fact the 60s in the US were so good that you would weep with anguish if I were to describe those days to you.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course crappy things happened back then too, but now, our whole world is crappy.

       That propaganda is evident in this thread.  People equate things like smartphones to an increased quality of life.  They forget they need to work much harder these days just to pay off a mortgage or get an education.

       Governments have to at the very least service the interest on these debts.  The UK for example pay roughly a £1Bn a week in the interest alone on their national debt.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/economics/10849333/Interest-bill-on-UKs-1.27-trillion-debt-to-hit-1bn-a-week.html">

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       That was back in 2014, when the national debt was £1.27Tn.  It's now £1.86Tn just 3 years later &gt;
       <a href="http://www.nationaldebtclock.co.uk/">
        http://www.nationaldebtclock.co.uk/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Assuming it's £1.5Bn a week with the extra debt now in 2017, that's £78Bn a year in interest alone.  That's just shy of what's spent on education in the UK per year.

       Beyond that, they moved the goalposts (diplomas are no longer good enough, now you need a degree) and made it so that the last twenty yards costs you several years of your young life to pay back (student loan debt). Debt slaves don't have time, resources, or energy to reflect or revolt.

       These appeals through mockery are very telling that you have no information besides your own formed beliefs on why any of it is untrue.
