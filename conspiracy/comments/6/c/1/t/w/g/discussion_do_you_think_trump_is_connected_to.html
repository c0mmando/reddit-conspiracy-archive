       My personal opinion, the media is in collusion with the DNC. Through research they must have seen that the Russia narrative would work, just look at our current situation. Can't definitively price who did, and didn't do what. Politicians doing routine communications with foreign nationals from around the globe, including Russia, are now labelled double agents. In general, I don't believe anything the MSM pushes. The fear mongering and blatant targeting of Trump scream propaganda to me.

       Are you talking about the same Media that spent a lot more time covering Hillary's emails than any issues, and never covered Trump on issues only his bias confirming outrage acts and statements.

       There were people posting in this sub who gave me the impression they were going to be allowed to form themselves into posses and go hunting for LGBT, POC, and immigrants as soon as Trump was sworn in, and the pizza factor expected Jeff Sessions to arrest all Democratic, immediately.

       Let's just acknowledge that this linked article is a comparison of emails to policy, it is not a comparison of emails to general coverage. The tone of the email coverage, in my opinion (and I am biased because I voted Trump) has always been to explain how they were a non issue. Coverage of Hillary was heavily biased in a positive light, if you weren't a supporter, while Trump coverage basically parroted Hillary's "racist, sexist, xenophobic" shtick she dropped at one of her few rallies.
      </p>
      <p>
       In this sub you saw posts that made you think people here we going to hunt down gays and people of color? Nonsense. I've been subbed here for years and never saw anything close to that, you've either created that straw man or are thinking about the way other subs have satirized any non liberal sub.

       You  have great filters, all during the primaries the Hillary team was accused of plotting against Sanders and his voters when they weren't covering emails and the Comey acts and that late memo were wall to wall anti-Hilllary.

       I am saying that the entire campaign, both sides were with the cooperation of the MSM, controlled by the same people.  And even had Hillary "won," we would still be in a crisis because that was the goal.

       The way that for the first 6 1/2 years every news show, every article had at least one attack against him? All day, and publishers like AP ran several per day and the entire Fox News Platform was ridicule and Attack Obama every show, all shows.  That kind of support? 
All I remember are the constant attacks.

       It's monetary, somewhere. Trump is either cool with it and complicit or unaware (meaning it's dark money "planted" in his coffers. Probably never an issue requiring a second thought before the manufactured scandals, now he's learned the truth somehow, which is why he won't release his taxes. So I think it's either a real thing or a frameup perpetrated by Russian intelligence, crafty motherfuckers. They fund populists, wittingly or otherwise).
      </p>
      <p>
       Chabad is an interesting angle.
      </p>
      <p>
       He has a history of looking the other way with shady Russians he's rented to and worked with.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or Trump went to the Putin-approved mob for funding once the US banks gave him the collective finger. This fits with his younger days penning construction contracts with NYC mobsters, who tended to share Roy Cohn as a lawyer with Trump, not coincidentally. In Trump business school, you take the best opportunity available to you, don't ask questions, make and receive good deals.
      </p>

       As for collusion...you have to ask yourself what stop was not pulled out by the Trump team during the election, how far they'd be willing to go to win. Who gives a shit who lends a hand, nice guys finish last, etc. If not Trump, maybe some of his campaign guys fucked around behind the scenes (beyond the known Manafort and Flynn deals). If that's the case, it'll be very hard for Trump to walk away unscathed.

      <p>
       Or none of that happened and Clinton couldn't escape her own scandals and failed to campaign in crucial swing states (absolutely true).

       OP, I've noticed a handful of posts this evening basically saying "OK give me your Trump-Russia evidence," these sort of "prove it" posts, which we never see here for any other topic, these weird challenges. Yours is alot more polite-seeming at least. What do you think about this shit?

       I think the "No evidence" of Russian influence and meddling is definitely a conspiracy driven narrative that gets support in the MSM.

       I don't think Trump any dealings with Russians that were any more or less illegal than any activities that involve the Russians are. This whole narrative is there to make him miserable and paralyzed, and to cover up the real reason for Clinton's loss, and the implications of what was disclosure in the various leaks. Those reasons are in order of least to greatest importance.

       Wow, they're bracingly uncreative.  Can't a group of lawbreaking spies come up with something more novel to charge a political opponent with than
       <em>
        espionage

       ?  Why does it always have to come down to an immature "NO U"?  I thought these people were supposed to be intelligent.

       Trump is connected to Russia the same way everyone in Hollywood is connected to Kevin Bacon. You'll find links if you look hard enough. I still haven't seen any compelling evidence that Trump or people close to him are
       <em>
        disproportionately
       </em>
       connected to Russia for people in their positions. If we were scrutinizing Trump's ties to Thailand or Brazil or Morocco, maybe the list would be similar, or worse. The reporting generally leaves out any sense of context or scale, so it's hard to know for sure.

       I guess it's possible.  We see lots of talk about means and opportunity, but not much on motive.
      </p>
      <p>
       If Trump has lots of property in Russia, or in one of the small separatist groups near Russia that sprung up during Yeltsin's time, then I could see some motive.  It's also possible that Trump's long history of fighting various countries on their land use laws has created a mutual enemy of Trump and Russia in some international regulatory body or another.
      </p>

       I haven't looked much into it, but that's the sort of thing I'd expect to see.

       So I've read literally hundreds of documents and watched dozens of videos and I'm a lot older than most of you guys and I've seen a lot of this stuff before in previous Administrations.  I'm going to say no, I do not believe that there's any connection other than trumps personal brand.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do believe that his brand is involved in business in Russia, but I don't think there's any collusion other than the usual steps that his brand had to take to do business there, meaning paying bribes and dealing with the corruption.
