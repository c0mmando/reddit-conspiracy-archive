    <div class="md"><p>It is conspiracy related. The neoliberals and neocons share the same beliefs on one thing: bombing the shit out of brown people. They&#39;ve done it for decades. This combination of foreign policy partisanship has helped them do two things</p>

<ol>
<li><p>They&#39;ve destabilized an oil rich region </p></li>
<li><p>Been able to oppress us here</p></li>
</ol>

<p>They were able to get the patriot act passed by magnifying the problem they created and instilling fear. In turn, they were able to control us even more.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t condone these attacks. I feel like they aren&#39;t much different than our military interventions though. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>First off, I am not Christian.</p>

<p>Secondly, I agree that organized religion needs to go away.</p>

<p>But, guess what? Christian fundamentalists do not believe in killing infidels. In fact, the worst I see them do is hold signs that says &quot;God hates fags&quot;.</p>

<p>You know why? Because Christianity is seperate from the state.</p>

<p>Islam is not just a religion, it is co-opted with sharia law.</p>

<p>Sharia Law is barbaric and stupid as fuck.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>One comment I have to make is that authoritarian regimes aren&#39;t necessarily all bad (as contradictory as that sounds). I noticed Paul Kagame is on the list and is definitely an authoritarian president in Rwanda, but the people of Rwanda love and support him, and, more importantly, they trust him. The people in Rwanda have needed a unifying figure that they can all support and trust to move their society forward, and Kagame has made only good decisions and has the interests of the country in mind. </p>

<p>Obviously it isn&#39;t the case for most places, but there are certainly &#39;benevolent dictators&#39; who truly are beneficial for the state being ruled over. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just wait...America will start bombing their own soil. Americans will blow up a school in conneticut if it means taking out 1 terrorist who may or may not be there. See to Americans its ok to murder innocent people so long as there is a slight chance you may get a &quot;terrorist&quot; and so long as they are brown skin color.</p>

<p>I find it disturbing how little Americans care about what their government is doing abroad. The moment anyone who isnt brown gets killed Americans flail their arms in the air like it is such a tragedy yet you see none of those same people speaking out against the atrocities America is carrying out across the globe.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was not being literal. I apologize for stating it in such a way that would cause someone to take it literally. </p>

<p>My message was intended as a general example of the incompetence/indifference in the use of drones, which have attacked weddings and other festive events where many innocents have died. </p>

<p>Instead, I will reiterate my apologies for being unclear/misleading, and remind readers here of one particular attack upon a wedding party where 12 died, including the bride and groom, dozens injured, and the US military refused to apologize.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.newsweek.com/wedding-became-funeral-us-still-silent-one-year-deadly-yemen-drone-strike-291403">http://www.newsweek.com/wedding-became-funeral-us-still-silent-one-year-deadly-yemen-drone-strike-291403</a></p>

<p>Again, I apologize for any misleading communications about the number in a single attack who died. The number of dead innocents in any one single attack on a wedding party is much smaller than 80. Thousands of innocents have died by drone attack in the recent past, however.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>terrorism is part of the political wing of islam, and has little to do with their theological underpinning, which forbids suicide. arab and middle eastern nations would like to unite into a cohesive block, this is against the interest of the rest of the oil consuming nations of the world which already hates dealing with OPEC.</p>

<p>the anglo-american establishment is left to do the dirty job of destabilizing these countries, but they tag in russia every now and then. It&#39;s been going on for over 50 years. to answer your question directly, people in power need to give a fuck about maintaining and growing power above all other things, human rights are a distant concern especially in an increasingly integrated, complicated and resource starved world.</p>

<p>&quot;we&quot; are not murdering each other, our political structures are murdering to maintain their own international coalitions and national stabilities. do you want your country to become a third world failed state with high crime, poverty and corruption? no? it&#39;s classic carrot and stick, leaders are as trapped in this scenario as anyone else. you can either attempt to understand the world how it is, or complain about how you&#39;d like it to be, how did marx and that little experiment in utopia turn out for the soviet block and chinese people, not so hot, it&#39;s okay let&#39;s do it with computers this time, no thanks.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Terrorism isn&#39;t part of any &quot;wing&quot; of Islam. Seriously. No debate. It stands totally outside of the scope of Islam. I understand what you&#39;re getting at but it&#39;s this common misunderstanding and confusion (very deliberately repeated) that has effectively made discussion impossible. The foundation of understanding is missing. Terrorism has many causes but Islam is not one of them. People may claim that Islam justifies terrorist acts, and both terrorists and anti-Islamic groups have a common ground there, ironically. But the reality of what Islamic theology both teaches and accepts from a moral point of view is extremely easy to find out. So it&#39;s very easy to verify that Islamic teaching puts terrorist activity in a very dire light, in fact it takes its place among the worst sins. It&#39;s not just semantics either. It&#39;s really important that &quot;Islam&quot; isn&#39;t used as a term for an &quot;entity&quot; or a &quot;thing&quot;. Islam is a rich religious tradition which is very well defined both historically and theologically. The fact that a religious tradition is used to justify this or that act isn&#39;t new. But the belief that somehow religion inherently causes people to act in violent ways is almost indelible and is seen as so self evident that it&#39;s difficult not to feel confused for a lot of people when the above is pointed out. So it&#39;s all being used to divide us. &quot;Religion&quot; as it&#39;s presented, is now used to control and divide us. Same with politics and the whole game is control, <em>confusion</em> and fear. That&#39;s why social media is such a win for TPTB. Notjing more powerfully confuses people that throwing them together and telling everyone that their opinion is as equally valid as everyone elses. Reasoning and critical thinking is a skill. It takes practice, it takes impartiality, it takes openmindedness and a sense of detachment from emotional reactivity. Very few have this ability although <em>all</em> are easily capable of it. Let&#39;s thank the schooling system for that. And by schooling, I mean TV and the media in general.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Personally, I have always been against the US policy of total war when it comes to civilians. That&#39;s the stance we&#39;ve taken unfortunately, that civilian lives are expendable in the name of completing an objective. Most of the United States operations in the Middle East have been for corrupt purposes as well, from securing oil and opium fields to playing world police to protect wealthy Saudi interests. Regardless of how you feel about 9/11 and whether it was a staged event or not, I think we can all agree that the way we went about it was fucked up, and we entirely ruined the infrastructure of Iraq under the guise of fighting terror in Afghanistan. GWB was just itching to finish the job that poppa Bush couldn&#39;t get done. </p>

<p>That being said, I feel it should be pointed out that these terrorist groups aren&#39;t exactly in response to US intervention. It&#39;s an ideological struggle, which has been greatly aided by the destabilization of the region, but not necessarily caused by it. For years, Saddam and other dictators of the Middle East were brutal tyrants but they were efficient at suppressing these types of terrorist groups such as Al Qaeda and the precursors of ISIS. It was in their interests to keep such groups from gaining power. When the US toppled Iraq, then Egypt, Libya, Syria, and the rest of the powerful warlords of the Middle East, it created an opportunity for fundamentalist terrorism to really take root and gain power. ISIS is the newest incarnation of that, and unlike Al Qaeda, who opposed the US because of events in the past, ISIS opposes the entire West because of ideological differences. They even despise any of their fellow Muslims who don&#39;t fall in line with their particular sect. While the US certainly paved the way for ISIS, Boko Haram, Al Nusra, and similar terror groups, they didn&#39;t really cause them. The ideological hatred was there all along, simmering beneath the surface, waiting for an opportunity to take their jihad global. </p>

<p>But then again America has very little proximity to some parts of Europe, yet they scream the loudest when an atrocity occurs.</p>

<p>The other side of this coin is dehumanization of those they want us to see as &quot;baddies&quot;. It&#39;s ok to kill children in a school because we got the badguys. It&#39;s only american generals and israeli politicians who say this publicly.</p>

<p>Collateral damage sounds good or justifiable. We have bigger and noble aims, collateral damage is inevitable. And we&#39;re very sad about that.</p>

<p>But that&#39;s extremely disturbing because then any act of political violence can be justified this way, no matter who the perp is.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Would be different if British civilians were going over and killing people in the ME. Or even if the British army were targeting civilians in the ME.</p>

<p>The truth is civilians are a casualty of war, more civilians died in WW2 than fighting soldiers.</p>

<p>The differenc being, those people are purposefully killing our civilians. Those animals and all of they&#39;re sympathisers can rot in hell.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was thinking about this yesterday. War is hell. Do you think we&#39;ll recalibrate our failed war on terror? Nope. We&#39;ll stick to what we know. We&#39;ll bomb cafes full of their kids with expensive missiles and call them &quot;collateral damage&quot;. Then we&#39;ll freak out and call it &quot;pure evil&quot; when they strike back. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not positive Labour would have won but there was definitely momentum building. It seems logical that this attack will benefit the Tories and the corporate warmongers who back them so I&#39;m assuming we&#39;re only going to get more of the same going forward. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is the most important post of the year. You see on the TV May talking about the innocent children who were killed, but she does not mention the innocent children that the UK has bombed in the ME. You cannot just talk about half of the story and expect to understand it. Of course, before they could rely on the media and distance and the language barriers to prevent the truth from coming out, but it is becoming more difficult for them now. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Far too many. Im not condoning that at all. Just saying that intentionally targeting kids who aren&#39;t even in a war zone just for the sake of killing them is not comparable to collateral deaths while trying to fight actual terrorists. I have a major problem with indiscriminate drone bombings and I want the U.S. to be held accountable for them. But it&#39;s not the same as purposefully murdering a bunch of kids at a concert.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I completely agree also.
If anyone is to blame for these attacks we shouldn&#39;t look past our own selves.
22 kids dead in Manchester and its a tragedy all over the news for days and days. Kill 400 kids in Syria and no one bats an eyelid. If we stopped killing them, maybe, just maybe, they&#39;ll stop killing us.</p>
