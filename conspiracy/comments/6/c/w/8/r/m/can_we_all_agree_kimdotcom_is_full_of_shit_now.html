       Kim isn't the world's savior. All of us have to put in a little bit of effort and our combined efforts will blow the cabal to high heaven. This is his little bit of effort. He's not God and he's limited in power like the rest of us outside of being a little popular. I thank this guy for doing something which is better than doing nothing. Everything helps is what I'm trying to say. Why should we attack people who only do a little when we are all doing only a little ourselves when we redpill, ect..

       He's rightfully doing both. There is nothing wrong with making money while helping the world. Trust me. If anyone can profit by helping the world, they are doing much better than those who profit by ruining the world. After all, we all have bills don't we?

       Every time someone helps us, people jump on this sub and shit on them. Why is that? Is it helpful to shit on people even if they help us a little? Who gives a shit about his business model. That dude's been making money like that for a long time. What do you expect? Should he shut down his business and then give info on Seth Rich? Why would he do that? I guess one reason would be so people won't talk shit about him.
      </p>
      <p>
       You guys need to start thanking our allies instead of shitting on them. Its not a big deal if you have to go on his website to hear some news on Seth Rich. He might made a few extra sales. What's the big deal? He needs money just like the rest of us. If you are going to criticize him, criticize him on whether he is being truthful or not but don't just make claims without any evidence. People come around here thinking they are smart to call people shills yet they have no evidence outside of their own gut instinct and those people are typically projecting themselves onto others.

       I expect him to release any info he has in a simple, easily digestible way. Not halfway down a website dedicated to his own brand and ego.

      <p>
       He instead released
       <em>
        nothing

       in between his fucking albums. The fact that you refuse to see this is evidence enough that you're just a fucking shill for Kim DotCom for some reason. He doesn't care about you or any of this.

       It will not matter how long we have to wait. IF the evidence is as damning as everyone keeps saying it is....it will be up to TPTB to release it.

      <p>
       Just my opinion...but by him going through lawyers and the official chain of command, the only thing he is doing is handing the evidence over &amp; (if it exists) ruining the oportunity for all of us to know the truth.

       Maybe, he doesn't have evidence and intentionally created a lose lose situation for anyone interested in the truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       He gave himself convenient excuses not to release it. He gave himself an impossible condition to even release it. Safe passage? For what, allegations that the entire commission would already know is bullshit?
      </p>
      <p>
       If the commission has evidence it was for sure the Russian hackers, then there's no reason for them to play ball with Kim (because it's obviously a media play for more damage.) The only way they'd grant him safe passage is if they don't have evidence that suggests it was Russian Hackers, which the intelligence agencies are on the record saying they have. So ask yourself, if he wanted to get the truth out, would he A) make the only possible condition for releasing the info be contingent on the intelligence communities publicly admitting they had incorrect info? or B) Release the info.
      </p>
      <hr/>

       It's a fuckin' scam of some kind... Until there's a release, it looks like a fuckin' scam.

       Exactly. Anyone who doubts PRESIDENT TRUMP is a shill for Big Ethics. PRESIDENT Trump is going to cut taxes for the middle class(KILLARY would have increased taxes on every1 to pay for Pizza Parties), he's getting us out of the Middle East (left Saudi Arabia for Israel), and is about to kill ObamaCare and let us chose across state borders what healthcare solution is best.

       Sure. But not enough to start a political witch hunt. My need for justice here is the same as any murder that doesn't directly impact my life. It's not playing much of a role. I'm more worried about the division of the proles and its effect on our future.

       Accusing? No that implies that they aren't the problem. Notifying is the word. And no it is part of the solution because then they might wake up and see sense if they haven't realised they are part of the problem yet.

       Idk if he has anything, but if he does it's smart to wait until there's a lot of people focusing on it. Otherwise he could have an accident or commit suicide and most people wouldn't give two fucks to try to make any connections.

       Attention and money is what he is after. He wants people talking about him and to be relevant. Those are his goals and he did a good job at accomplishing them. I never would have watched his crappy music video if it wasn't linked in this sub and Bam!

       This is what they mean by any publicity is good publicity. I still suggest everyone watch his video for the LULZ@1:11

       He's a phony. I don't even think they believe him themselves anymore. It's just an excuse to keep the narrative on Seth instead of the other big stories they don't want you talking about.

       He ran a file sharing site probably better than rapidshare so he got rich then he got chased for facilitating file sharing on the back end (sites like rapid share were quick to remove illegal content) so he fled to nz and got busted by the FBI but there's not enough evidence to extradite him so now he sits in his big mansion in a place where the majority of people hate him and tweets bullshit all day.

       I don't understand the current state of releasing things.
      </p>
      <p>
       For wikileaks, it makes sense to drop a file password protected for a later release.  However, at some point, they upped the game from that, into the 'hype game', where they built more hype than they could deliver.  Now Kim is doing the same - and he has been since last year.   I'm not sure if he gets a high from it, or what, but if you have information, you release it immediately, and if you aren't ready to release it, you don't tell people you have it until you are ready.  The way this is happening, it seems...idk, more like roleplay than a real release.

       No no no. Its marketing. He knows the strongest weapon is a powerful voice and audience. &amp; look at how many times his name has been posted here. Haven't heard this guys name is years, not since the goverment raided his house. Today? His name seems to all over the front page. Its day 1 marketing shit. Take any intrest, claim you know something they don't any you instantly have their interest. Now do that over a period of months or years and you have constant web traffic coming his way. He know exactly what he's doing.

       Not to mention this could be worth immunity on other crimes and would be well worth a negotiation for him. Hence waiting to release the evidence until he gets something. Kind of a shitty thing to do, but it makes sense from his perspective.

       You mean like the russia investigation? It should take time, is slow, etc?

       Seth could release anything he wants to. He is an attention whore who dragged this on for days to basically say nothing.

      <p>
       He used the donald and people investigating seth to get attention and clicks.

       And, as usual, those people fell for it because they wanted to believe, and people on the outside looking in telling people it was all BS were called shills, etc.

       Maybe if more 'investigators' online would look for the actual truth and not just for biased info they want to be real they would actually get to the truth once in awhile.

       Here's the thing, and let's make sure we have the story right:
      </p>
      <p>
       1) He claimed to have spoken directly with Seth, while he was alive.
      </p>
      <p>
       2) That means that he has spent the last year sitting on this not saying anything, even though it potentially is a damning political bombshell.
      </p>
      <p>
       3) Coincidentally, as the white house is going through the actual justice process for investigation into the claims of Russian interference, he publicly admits to having this.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       What are we supposed to think? Seems to me that this whole mess is some kind of ridiculous setup that's all about mocking the political process. These people HATE the fucking republicans (and the Dems), but HATE republicans. That doesn't change just because Trump is in office. This is the party of the patriot act. This is the party of FISA courts... It's fuckin' bait. They are getting the entire republican base getting fired up over the most ridiculous shit, and we're going to have to put up with the fallout in this country where a large chunk of the populace believes that kim fuckin' dotcom is the reason why the Democratic party still exists. It's going to be retarded.

       If Kim had evidence the leaker wasn't a Russian hacker, then even if it wasn't Seth, he'd still have a fucking bomb against the DNC because it turns a large portion of the Russian investigation into a politically motivated which hunt...

       He isn't providing evidence, that he claimed to already have for over a year.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't fuck with me. I'm not in the mood over this specific thing, because we've literally had a national organization claim physical evidence existed, then retract the story. We've had Kim claim entirely different evidence existed and that he's known for a year.
      </p>
      <p>
       He's had all the time in the world to release what he's got, and he's chosen instead to play the hype game. Until he releases he's a bullshitter.

       The Russia narrative is dead unless they can refute Kim's claims while  his offer to testimony under oath is on the table.

       Maybe Hannity is all over this because he has inside information that the administration will indeed give safe passage to testify.It would certainly be in their interests.

       IIRC, Assange and his legal team have repeatedly reached out to the U.S. government in regards to turning himself in, but the U.S. has yet to reach back or discuss extradition or anything of the sort. Unless that information has changed in the past few months, at least.

       Assange has also previously made statements that the main reason he refuses to be forcefully extradited to the United States is due to the fact that the government will place him in front of a private court (which will be the furthest from impartial) as opposed to a public court with a relatively impartial jury. Which is fair enough, I think.
      </p>
      <p>
       But it's clear that the United States government would rather, "kidnap" him from the embassy and force him to face a private court anyway. So to be quite honest, I don't really blame him for avoiding leaving the embassy, given the circumstances.

       If members of the DNC
       <em>
        didn't
       </em>
       assassinate Rich, then their behavior about this case is completely illogical. They would have been parading this for gun control, demanding investigations, and throwing everyone with an 'R' next to their name under the bus if Rich was one of their establishment cronies.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is not a single reasonable thing going on with this whole situation. Unless, of course, you consider that they assassinated him. No confirmation bias needed.

       Yes because it has to be one or the other, there is no room for anything else at all.

       And look, I think he was assassinated. But I don't pretend like there can't be other possibilities.

       What?
      </p>
      <p>
       The DNC has been completely reasonable in this case. It's literally just conspiracy theorists trying
       <em>
        desperately
       </em>
       to find something weird about it because it would fit their narrative.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Parading this for gun control" --&gt; Done. Hillary Clinton mentioned him.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Demanding investigations" --&gt; Why the hell? It was a botched robbery. Literally all the facts point to that. The neighboorhood where he was had an active gang who robbed people days before he was there.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's hilarious that people seriously think he was "assasinated". Appaarently the DNC is this super awesome crime syndicate that can murder people (no motive to murder Seth Rich either after he already leaked) and then cover it up, but the "assassins" they hire
       <em>
        can't even assasinate him properly
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Literally everything about the "Seth Rich was assassinated" narrative is utter bullshit. There's no motive, no clues and it fucking does not look like an "assassination". Nice assassins, shooting a guy twice and then running away
       <em>
        while he's still alive
       </em>
       .

       Literally everything you just wrote is wrong.  There is no evidence for your side (what was robbed? Where are the security camera videos? Where are the body camera videos?  Why is the police report so empty? Why does wikileaks basically say that he was the source of the leak? Why is the DNC warding off investigators? Why did the DNC put a crisis manager in as the family spokesman?) but mounting evidence for a sloppy assassination and cover up.
      </p>
      <p>
       None of the above questions are reasonably answerable unless you shift your incorrect assertions and admit he was assassinated. Nice troll post though.

        Asked about a quote attributed to him in the Fox News story in which he said his "investigation up to this point shows there was some degree of email exchange between Seth Rich and Wikileaks," Wheeler said he was referring to information that had already been reported in the media.

       True, but it's not completely crazy to suggest that Fox is something of a separate faction within the MSM. I don't really think they are secretly aligned with CNN, but CNN is obviously aligned with NBC, WaPo, etc.

       How about trump's tax returns? They all do it, including Maddow. This would be massive, if what they claimed was true. This whole election has been nothing  but hype, Acting like this unique to just this case, is a bit hypocritical.

       Here's an interesting theory... Kim Dot Com is a foreigner, he said he had contact with "Panda" &gt;I KNOW THAT SETCH RICH WAS INVOLVED IN THE DNC LEAK. I know this because in late 2014 a person contacted me about helping me to start a branch of the Internet Party in the United States. He called himself Panda. I now know that Panda was Seth Rich.
So what if Seth Rich was unmasked, because he was caught up in foreign surveillance. Just building a theory I read, so make of it what you will.

       Fox News has been doing this a lot lately.  They clearly ran with this story to distract from a story that ran only hours beforehand about the Trump/Russia investigation. Even Wheeler, who initially broke the story to Fox News, later said he was just saying what FN told him to say.  Right before the election Bret Baier ran a story about Hillary's email server being breached only to retract it after a night of hyping it.

       There will never be justice for Seth Rich. None of the people involved in Seth Rich murder will be brought the justice. The satanic pedo ring will never be brought down. This is the unfortunate reality we live in. It's time I think we all just gave up trying to change things because it won't happen. It's time to go back to talking about aliens/UFOs and bigfoot.

       I wonder how pissed Julian is about this. KDC clearly is acting on his own, and even Julian's tweet the other day about sources connecting with 3rd party people etc. You know he was getting his own back. Though Assange hasn't outright said that KDC is gone rogue and has nothing to do with Wikileaks, so there's that

       No. I'm starting to think KimDotCom is paid to discredit credible news TPTB don't want to gain traction. He did it with Hillary emails and now that Kim chimed in on the Seth Rich investigation, today's narrative is for everybody to abandon looking into Seth Rich's death because... Kim is a douche?

       KDC was screwed over by the TPTB, this is why he is looking to leverage into this into "safe passage" to the USA. If he steps on US soil he is likely to be murdered, kidnapped, thrown in prison, taken to a dark site or who knows what else.
      </p>
      <p>
       Remember that TPTB, in his case the people who are copyright owners (RIAA, MPAA et. al.) had enough influence in our own government that they pushed the NZ government to seize his assets, steal his money, shut down his operation etc. Look up the history of Megaupload.
      </p>
      <p>
       That being said, I have no idea what he has exactly if he has anything or if he is just playing games or looking for a deal.

       Can we all agree that the active users in this subject double when the Seth Rich story hit and a very obvious attempt is being made to discredit it?

       I think that rule is more to just keep people from hurling mindless insults at one another, cause that's never productive towards discussion. Or at least I hope that's why that rule is there.

       But I mean, it's pretty obvious when a forum or topic is being targeted. You just watch the numbers, read the energy, and pay attention to what topics are the hot ones. It's pretty basic observation.

       It's easy for us to tell because we've probably both been using the Internet for a long time and know to look for these things. There are too many people going through life in a fuzzy daze who will never see or understand this. Once A.I. gets up and running (if it's not already) we're gonna be talking to A.I. bots and not realizing it. Then the tyranny really ramps up.

       Instinct becomes important to trust. There's a sort of subconscious part of us that already knows what's up. The gut feeling. The little voice.

       There will always be an effort to manipulate our experience. We need to maintain an effort to decide for ourselves what we are seeing, and not entertain what others are telling us we are seeing.

       Nah not buyin' that shit man. Too smart. But I won't waste our time arguing. I have hundreds of people in my social circles who look to me to give them the information on this. Reddit is mostly a time killer for me. The real work is offline away from the influence of anonymous people and whatever agenda they're peddling.

       I have two other questions regarding Kim DotCom.

      <p>
       a}  Why does anyone still listen to anything he says?
      </p>
      <p>
       b}  Aside from making grand promises that never go anywhere, what has he ever done aside from drawing attention to himself?

       Fox News has been doing this a lot lately.  They clearly ran with this story to distract from a story that ran only hours beforehand about the Trump/Russia investigation. Even Wheeler, who initially broke the story to Fox News, later said he was just saying what FN told him to say.  Right before the election Bret Baier ran a story about Hillary's email server being breached only to retract it after a night of hyping it.
