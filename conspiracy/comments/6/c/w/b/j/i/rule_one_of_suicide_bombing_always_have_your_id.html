<p>However there seems to be certain gaping holes in the stories reported. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know about you, but if I were a suicide bomber carrying ID is the last thing I&#39;d even think of let alone do.</p>

<p>Also if I was a suicide bomber carrying ID on my person, surely it would be destroyed?? </p>

<p>Unless I somehow brought an ID as a way of pointing at the guilty party and conveniently leaving it somewhere I know wouldn&#39;t get destroyed in the explosion.</p>

<p>Thoughts?</p>

<p>May have needed ID to verify ticket purchase/will-call window or something</p>

<p>Might have been on a watch list before the event to have his name / ID in some database to point at when they ran IDs</p>

<p>There are gaping holes because it&#39;s an active investigation literally hours after the event.  They won&#39;t just release all known information to the public. </p>

This is the UK, like most of Europe if not all, you need to have an ID on you. I never go out without it.</p>

<p>And there&#39;s always the case they dont care or even want to be ID&#39;d cause terrorists like to lay claim on their actions.</p>

<p>You don&#39;t think they&#39;d detect the bomb he was supposedly wearing on the frisk search they do beforehand?</p>

<p>I&#39;ve already said in earlier comments that he most likely was not there at the start of the concert for this very reason. However at the end of a gig, as everyone starts to leave there are no security on the door. </p>

<p>I was at a concert recently at our biggest arena and towards the end and lost my friends. Went to find them outside and came back inside to look for them several times at the end of the night. No security ever once stopped me reentering the building. </p>

<p>It would be very easy to sneak in at that time and there&#39;d still be a huge crowd at the end of a concert at that time.</p>

<p>FWIW I was at Manchester Arena about a year ago, and there was no frisk. A rudimentary bag check, but no frisk.</p>

<p>Also from the photos I&#39;ve seen, the targeted area was a public area (it&#39;s where my mother waited for me and my sister, so obviously she didn&#39;t have a ticket or go through security to get there).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Again, what the fuck is it with you. First you bring up 9/11, now crack sprinkled on people?? Neither one of those has anything to do with your post. They are completely unrelated and are in fact circumstantially different than the attack last night. You cannot use those events as a basis of comparison to last night&#39;s attack.</p>

<p>Either you can accept the science that indicates an explosion does not always disintegrate things within the blast radius, or you can&#39;t. Choice is yours.</p>

<p>And for the record, no. I do not find it suspect that they find IDs when these events occur. For the following reasons.
* Most people carry ID on them
* Terrorists are not really concerned with concealing their involvement. (Remember, this shit is a badge of honor for these fucks)
* Science
* Common Sense
* Logic
* Deductive Reasoning</p>

    <div class="md"><p>yeah i remember the last time I walked 3.5 miles in a city directly to my destination. </p>

<p>Do you live near/in a city?  Every been to a city?</p>

<p>By &quot;walking distance&quot; you would mean that the 2.7 mile distance from one river to the other traversing the Borough of Manhattan is just a peachy leisurely stroll. 
That&#39;s literally what cabs are for</p>

<p>Just because people CAN walk doesn&#39;t mean they do or it&#39;s efficient or necessary or even that they want to.  Plus he was strapped with explosives.  3.5 miles carrying extra weight would be annoying/exhausting as fuck.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve walked 5 miles everyday for college, and 5 miles back last year until I got a bike. It took me an hour and a half. Cycling it only took an 30 minutes. </p>

<p>So I would say 3.5 miles is within walking distance. 
I would even say that he would do that because he had that purpose. It would be annoying as F. But he probably had extra adrenaline. Some sort of fight or flight/now or never feelings going on.</p>

<p>You can pay cabs cash. Buses even take cash. Still don&#39;t need ID or a wallet.</p>

<p>Indeed. The attackers <em>want</em> be identified. Why in the hell do people think terrorist groups claim credit for their attacks? That&#39;s part of their game.</p>

<p>Plus, as people have pointed out countless times, if you&#39;re trying to <em>get</em> to your chosen attack location, you don&#39;t want to be thwarted because you got tangled up in a police matter and didn&#39;t have your proper ID with you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree. It did occur right after the show was done tho, after she had left the stage and people were just beginning to walk out, so I&#39;m sure many had put their cameras down and stopped snapchatting and stuff. There is some footage on twitter and online as I&#39;m sure you might have seen already. But it does seem that with 20,000 people there would at least be some videos or images closer to where the explosion happened. Perhaps they will turn up in the coming days.

<p>The only point I want to make is that I need to see evidence that there was a bomb. A picture of some broken glass, shrapnel damage on buildings, burn marks on the ground, something. The fact that no pictures are out there, not even on social media where respect for victims doesn&#39;t really exist is very puzzling to me. </p>

<p>Think back to the Boston marathon bombings and the endless stream of media that came out. Obviously that&#39;s a larger event but I think it&#39;s reasonable to expect one photo. </p>

<p>I see a picture that corroborates the official narrative and I&#39;m on your side. </p>

<p>This attack happened near an exit of a concert, I&#39;ve never been to a concert that was filming the exit after the show as intensely as the finish line to the Boston marathon, if the attack had taken place inside the show there would have definitely been all kinds of vertical videos of the explosion  </p>

<p>Like I&#39;ve been saying. People need to make the news prove these events. There should be photos on social media of people laying on the ground outside of the arena (not the picture of the people inside who were trampled). Respect for the victims is a cop out.

<p>videos from inside the paris concert shooting, ive even asked pubicly in this sub if anyone has seen any other pictures than like the stock news paper images of bodies on the ground. </p>

<p>i have seen one video of the band when the firing started... but that is it. that must have been the only recording device working in the entire concert hall.</p>

<p>lets be honest, we are all humans... there were people stuck in there with them, and even afterwards. we live in the world star hip . hop days... someone is filming something. at least taking pictures. I mean... lets say boom last terrorist in the concert hall is killed or whatever, NOT ONE PERSON stuck takes a photo? or a snapchat of any part of the ordeal? or anything? </p>

<p>this also can be said for the orlando pulse shooting. where are those photos/videos from people cell phones... </p>

<p>are these things deleted by authorities while being talked to or what? </p>

<p>Think about most attacks youve heard about... i mean jesus even 9/11, 15+ years later youd think more videos would be out. I know its someting they would try and stop. but after plane 1 hit, even for 2001 im sure there were a massive amount of people filming or pointing cameras in that direction. I am not saying you wont find home footage (esp the home footage we were shown by media anyway) on the internet or youtube... you would just think there would be SOOO much more by now.</p>

<p>okay... end slight rant. (but if anyone does have any like actual proof type videos or photos during/post any of those attacks please link)</p>

<p>No, but it can soften them, and the weight of the building can bend them when they&#39;re weakened by the heat. I don&#39;t believe the official story at all, but &quot;jet fuel can&#39;t melt steel beams&quot; is a bad argument. There&#39;s a reason it turned into a meme used to mock us.</p>

<p>But really, this one incident isn&#39;t smoking gun &quot;proof&quot; of anything.  An i.d. could reasonably survive this explosion.

<p>I&#39;m not denying other madmen have done mundane things before killing others. But I do find it weird a thing to be doing when you know you&#39;ll be dying too.

That way if pulled over they have one less reason to search his vehicle.

<p>Poor planning on your part, then. You get tangled up with the police on your way to your attack, you&#39;ve just made yourself more suspicious and may have had your attack thwarted. Being as in line with the law as you can until the attack is the best idea if you actually want to <em>carry out</em> your attack.</p>

<p><em>After</em> the attack, not only does it not matter if you are identified, terrorist groups <em>want</em> credit for their attacks, so the ID being at the scene isn&#39;t a big deal either way.</p>

<p>Also if I was a suicide bomber carrying ID on my person, surely it would be destroyed??</p>

<p>A little piece of sturdy plastic contained in a wallet, surrounded by other stuff and protected by your body? Not likely, unless it was a HUGE bomb and your body was engulfed in flame or some such. A simple blast? Nah. ID, credit cards, little things like that would survive.</p>

<p>There&#39;s no general requirement to carry ID, so not doing so shouldn&#39;t be all that suspicious (even when driving, <a href="https://www.gov.uk/stopped-by-police-while-driving-your-rights">you get 7 days to present your ID if it is requested</a>). Personally I haven&#39;t carried ID for years (not for any particular reason - I just don&#39;t see the point in risking losing it when I don&#39;t need it with me). </p>

<p>TBH, I probably wouldn&#39;t even think about it either way. If he thought he might need cash (for a bus for instance), he probably just grabbed his wallet out of habit.</p>

<p>Also if I was a suicide bomber carrying ID on my person, surely it would be destroyed??</p>

<p>A plastic card, shielded by the wallet and whatever else it contains, sounds rather likely to survive IMO. Maybe damaged (by shrapnel etc.), but I can&#39;t imagine it being completely destroyed. </p>

<p>But really, this one incident isn&#39;t smoking gun &quot;proof&quot; of anything.  An i.d. could reasonably survive this explosion.

<p>videos from inside the paris concert shooting, ive even asked pubicly in this sub if anyone has seen any other pictures than like the stock news paper images of bodies on the ground. </p>

<p>i have seen one video of the band when the firing started... but that is it. that must have been the only recording device working in the entire concert hall.</p>

<p>lets be honest, we are all humans... there were people stuck in there with them, and even afterwards. we live in the world star hip . hop days... someone is filming something. at least taking pictures. I mean... lets say boom last terrorist in the concert hall is killed or whatever, NOT ONE PERSON stuck takes a photo? or a snapchat of any part of the ordeal? or anything? </p>

<p>this also can be said for the orlando pulse shooting. where are those photos/videos from people cell phones... </p>

<p>are these things deleted by authorities while being talked to or what? </p>

<p>Think about most attacks youve heard about... i mean jesus even 9/11, 15+ years later youd think more videos would be out. I know its someting they would try and stop. but after plane 1 hit, even for 2001 im sure there were a massive amount of people filming or pointing cameras in that direction. I am not saying you wont find home footage (esp the home footage we were shown by media anyway) on the internet or youtube... you would just think there would be SOOO much more by now.</p>

<p>okay... end slight rant. (but if anyone does have any like actual proof type videos or photos during/post any of those attacks please link)</p>
