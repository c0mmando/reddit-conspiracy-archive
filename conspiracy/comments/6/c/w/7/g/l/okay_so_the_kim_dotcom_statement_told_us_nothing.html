    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re right. But given all we know about Assange, a coy nod is actually a very big statement. And, it isn&#39;t all that coy. In fact, I think it&#39;s overt enough that if KDC doesn&#39;t come through it&#39;ll hurt the WL reputation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree that the &#39;nod&#39; is a big statement, but they&#39;ve done that nod before and been wrong, and then everyone forgets real quickly. for example, they boosted the teaser about CNN Leaks, which turned out to be nothing, but no one got mad at them for hyping a hoax that time</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not sure how much the fault extends to wikileaks. It <em>was</em> leaked footage of an operation we&#39;re typically not privvy to. I doubt WL is going to dedicate 200 hours just to make sure something is okay to tweet. I&#39;d guess they asked O&#39;Keefe to prove he had these tapes and was going to release them and that was enough to tweet. especially since he was referring to the release as &#39;wikileaks style&#39;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>New information, yes. And it is... interesting. BUT, it hardly lives up to him knowing Seth was the leaker because he &#39;was involved&#39;. This assumes <em>involved in the leaks</em> not involved just with Rich.</p>

<p>These pieces could very well fit together. And maybe KDC doesn&#39;t want the perpetrators to know exactly what he has so they won&#39;t have time to prepare their spin. For some reason, which hopefully we&#39;ll find out, he wants to handle this quietly for now vs. posting whatever the evidence is online for the world to see. I just hope this all makes sense in the end.</p>
