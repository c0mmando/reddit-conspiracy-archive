       That's the thing that doesn't fit. Kim may have a history of trolling but wikileaks does not. There's no doubt the tweets were thinly veiled endorsements of Kim's story. Theories?

       to be fair, nothing wikileaks tweeted shows concrete approval or rejection of kim's story- it's more like a coy nod towards it. from what i've seen they've done that a lot over the last year

       You're right. But given all we know about Assange, a coy nod is actually a very big statement. And, it isn't all that coy. In fact, I think it's overt enough that if KDC doesn't come through it'll hurt the WL reputation.

       I agree that the 'nod' is a big statement, but they've done that nod before and been wrong, and then everyone forgets real quickly. for example, they boosted the teaser about CNN Leaks, which turned out to be nothing, but no one got mad at them for hyping a hoax that time

       I'm not sure how much the fault extends to wikileaks. It
       <em>
        was
       </em>
       leaked footage of an operation we're typically not privvy to. I doubt WL is going to dedicate 200 hours just to make sure something is okay to tweet. I'd guess they asked O'Keefe to prove he had these tapes and was going to release them and that was enough to tweet. especially since he was referring to the release as 'wikileaks style'

       Well if I was investigating, I wouldn't say it was nothing.  He said Seth was looking to form an Internet Party.  As far as I know, that's knew information.  I'd talk to Seth's friends and family and see if he ever mentioned such an idea.  If he did, then I'd put more weight on Kim Dotcom's claims.

       New information, yes. And it is... interesting. BUT, it hardly lives up to him knowing Seth was the leaker because he 'was involved'. This assumes
       <em>
        involved in the leaks
       </em>
       not involved just with Rich.
      </p>
      <p>
       These pieces could very well fit together. And maybe KDC doesn't want the perpetrators to know exactly what he has so they won't have time to prepare their spin. For some reason, which hopefully we'll find out, he wants to handle this quietly for now vs. posting whatever the evidence is online for the world to see. I just hope this all makes sense in the end.

       Don't exactly understand your comment. Sounds like you're suggesting WL is attention whoring by pitching their book. IDK, wl has to support their efforts. If they wanted to 'sell out' there are plenty of bigger and better ways to do it (and longer view) then slyly endorsing KDCs false claims. (if they are)

       <em>

       you would notice that their pinned tweet has nothing to do with leaks or info, but rather a tweet about selling a fucking book to gullible fools.

       Aren't they selling books to support their cause? We don't need to find a problem and nefarious intentions in every act of every public figure and organization.
      </p>
      <p>
       What is this book about? A coming of age romance? I'm guessing it's about wikileaks. So if you're interested in wikileaks and like reading books, you get a book and they get to keep leaking documents for the world to see. I'm having trouble seeing the problem here.

       this is my struggle with the situation, wikileaks seems to be suggestive towards the fact that rich was the leaker but now this is the 2nd time they have pushed iffy stories relating to the case. Combine this with the fact that the russian embassy twitter was giving the seth rich story attention and it looks a little suspicious in my opinion

       I'm sick of this. This whole thing makes us all look like wackos.
      </p>
      <p>
       If people want to levy charges for murder against the DNC, then solid incontrovertible evidence is needed.  Hard. evidence.   Until then, I would respectfully request that Wikileaks and Kim cut it out.
      </p>
      <p>
       When the day comes that solid evidence is available, then let's throw the book at them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Otherwise, we all look like fools.

       I love Wikileaks, but this is childish, immature, bullshit.

       The trolling I was speaking of was his suggestion that he had the emails everyone was looking for. Then said it was the NSA that had them. People were annoyed.
      </p>
      <p>
       He may well be serious this time. The WL tweets suggest it to me, hence the post. I'm just here looking for a theory as to WHY wikileaks would tacitly endorse KDC if his story wasn't true. If I hear a good one, I'll call myself duped and move on. But, until then, I'm stuck believing.

       Assange no longer being alive would be the only plausible explanation to endorse KDC if they don't know for a fact it's true.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's NO WAY Assange just tweets what his handlers want. It's the other way around. He doesn't take the rep of WL lightly at all.

       I will agree that assange and his handlers are very careful about his rep. Why else would they run a limited hangout like that but to control a leak as it happens?

       I believe WL because of their track record. Of course we need evidence. But given WLs commitment to protecting sources the best they can do for now is the veiled endorsements of the story.
      </p>
      <p>
       We should believe neither the conspiracy, nor the offered narrative, until we have proof either way. But both should be investigated until there's a definitive conclusion.

       Aren't they selling books to support their cause? We don't need to find a problem and nefarious intentions in every act of every public figure and organization.
      </p>
      <p>
       What is this book about? A coming of age romance? I'm guessing it's about wikileaks. So if you're interested in wikileaks and like reading books, you get a book and they get to keep leaking documents for the world to see. I'm having trouble seeing the problem here.
