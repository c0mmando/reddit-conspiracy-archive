       Kim Dotcom (or how was he called) just "proven" that Seth was the leaker. And what do you think? No, he didn't. He released press release that Seth communicated with him and that he has proof that Seth was the leaker what he could show in justice case. Fucking hype. Man, this person is fucking retard. You can see his press release on kim.com (scroll bit down). Do you see that he didn't even put it on top of the webpage? He could have uploaded screenshot of press release on twitter, but no - he wants to advertise his website.
      </p>
      <p>
       What a fucking fool. ðŸ˜ 
      </p>
      <p>
       He could have destroyed all Muh Russia narrative, but no, he can't even show his proof.

      <p>
       Just W T F

       I remember all that CNNleaks hype that ended up to be nothing. Fucking idiotism.

       This is a lesson for you,

       . You can't trust someone from internet that says that he has some proof of something. Or 4chan LARPS. This is disgusting.

       Really? You need to "look at" it? The answer isn't already ABUNDANTLY CLEAR?

       are ALL psyops designed to sow discord, mistrust, disunity, and chaos among the American/Western populace. How many of those have you dweebs been chasing your tails on, only for them to lead right back up your own asses? How do you not see this!?

       What i can tell you is Russia didn't hack DNC. If there was leaker, then it was Seth Ritch. I don't know. But it wasn't Russia like MSM said. Check out

       Definitely disappointed, but you can't complain about the position of where it was on his website. Websites are built a certain way, and it would be a pretty big programming project to have put it at the top...the section it is in, is a section that can get update quickly, vs having to hard program it it. I'm a designer....

       Do you expect people to stop believing he was the leaker because Kim sitcoms statement had no substance? What does that change? Or because all of a sudden fox news reports on it, it's now a hoax started by fox news? People have been saying it was Seth rich for months. Why would fox fucking news affect the legitimacy of the conspiracy?

       I agree. Kdc can provide evidence or not. I don't believe the Seth rich story because of him, I believed it long before he ever said anything. I guessed people who only started believing it because kdc said he had prior can go back to not believing it. I don't think this impacts anything unless an investigation is started and they get his statement.

       It's a sad world we live in when Donald Trump has a death cult and they have faith in KDC, the man who sold out anonymous.

       Do you expect people to stop believing he was the leaker because Kim sitcoms statement had no substance? What does that change? Or because all of a sudden fox news reports on it, it's now a hoax started by fox news? People have been saying it was Seth rich for months. Why would fox fucking news affect the legitimacy of the conspiracy?

       I'm saying that people believed that Kim Dotcom had evidence, and they believe that what he has presented IS evidence.  Jeez, I've said it like three times now.
