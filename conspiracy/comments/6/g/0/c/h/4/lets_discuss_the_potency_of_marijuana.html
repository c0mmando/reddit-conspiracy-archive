    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think it&#39;s out of the realm of possibility for potency to be higher now. Maybe not that much but when you have growers with technology that allows them to cultivate flower with as much THC as chemically viable, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a stretch to say it&#39;s at least reasonably stronger. maybe not by magnitudes though.</p>

I think the spread of the internet over the exact period you&#39;re talking about is a big part of it.

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m with you. I really appreciate the energy you put into the post.</p>

<p>IMO, as a daily chronic smoker for 25+ years and former commercial grower, pot is, on average, &quot;stronger&quot; these days.</p>

<p>Not that killer bud wasn&#39;t available, but that the sheer magnitude of the selective breeding to increase desirable traits (potency, ratio/odor/taste/yield/flowering duration/length of daylight cycle for sexual expression/appearance/burning quality/disease-pest resistance/ etc etc...)</p>

<p>I have always smoked potent pot. Back in the 90&#39;s it was a little harder to find the good stuff sometimes, but it was always available. These days i&#39;d have to go pretty far out of my way to find some shitty bud.</p>

<p>Potency is mostly a genetic trait. You can increase it slightly with good growing practices by ensuring the plant reaches it&#39;s full potential, but mostly it&#39;s yield and duration that are effected positively with max co2, nutrients and environment.</p>

<p>So what I&#39;m saying is maybe you can increase your yield, but the only way to effect potency is through genetics and breeding. Giving the plant more light (assuming you had &quot;enough&quot; to start) won&#39;t make it more potent, just bigger.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve smoked for more than 30 years.   I&#39;m curious if you, as a long-time smoker, find it difficult to get really high on even good stuff?</p>

<p>I still get high, it just seems that the high clears my body so much more quickly than it used to.  I&#39;m not putting this down to difference in weed, rather I imagine it&#39;s a difference in how my body is processing it.  Do you notice anything like this?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey sorry, missed your reply.</p>

<p>Yeah, I can definitely observe my tolerance build if I&#39;m smoking alot, usually I&#39;ll switch up the bud or I&#39;ll take a little break. </p>

<p>If I&#39;m smoking anything other than 100% sativa, I find I build a tolerance pretty fast. Like Kush for example, love it, but can&#39;t smoke it for more than a few days. </p>

<p>But I haven&#39;t actually smoked a joint in months. I&#39;ve discovered concentrates. Shatter, wax and rosin. The idea of drying some flowers and rolling it up in paper and burning it seems almost antiquated to me now.</p>

<p>I highly recommend the dabs. </p>

<p>Cheers bro!</p>

<p>As for the OP weed has gotten stronger because of advancements in the field and selective breeding. They aren&#39;t just breeding them for potency though but also flavor/aroma. The same thing has been done for hops, weeds cousin. Hop strains have been bred for higher alpha acid content and ironically the same flavor/aroma compounds found in cannabis.</p>

<p>It depended on who you knew.  There was good pot available in the 1980&#39;s in the PNW, but a lot on the market was also crap.  I would have to guess that it probably didn&#39;t exceed 18% THC though, or did rarely.  Strains have gotten better, practices have also.  Saying it&#39;s 30-50x times stronger is absurd.  There was weed coming from Mexico that was crap, but people would buy it anyway because it was often the only game in town.</p>

<p>In short-- I remember the sticky-icky in the 80&#39;s.... sometimes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Anecdotal evidence, but in my experience the potency is a good bit higher now than it was in the &#39;80s. Most of what we could get on the market back then was red haired sinsemilla. Seedy, stemmy, and compressed. It did the job, but not like some of the stuff you can get today.</p>

<p>There were different grades of homegrown back then. Usually if you heard &quot;homegrown&quot; it was some kid fucking around in the woods that managed to get a plant to grow but couldn&#39;t tell males from females, didn&#39;t know when to harvest, let alone how to properly trim a fresh bud, and maybe they ended up with some grassy tasting straggly seedy buds.  </p>

<p>Sometimes you&#39;d run into someone who knew what they were doing, but the growing process has changed. People used to grow from seed usually outdoors, now they grow from clones often indoors. I know a guy who was turning $100,000 under the table (obvs) a year, growing outdoors from seed back in the &#39;80s. Not a big-time grower, just a sideline stream of income. Pretty good side money. </p>

<p>You have so many more options nowadays for products too. In the &#39;80s, you pretty much had bud and hash and that was about it. You had to make your own edibles. I can&#39;t wait to walk into a store one of these days. Hopefully my state goes full legal before I&#39;m too old to enjoy it.  </p>

<p>Sinsemilla by definition is seedless. It is the name for culling all the male plants to make the females increase their THC production instead of growing seeds.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So it&#39;s a label for a method rather than a strain? Well, hunh. </p>

<p>Except that I&#39;m certain that the stuff we were getting was seedy, yet called that anyway. Which, if they were growing it from seed and culling the males, would make sense because you still have the potential for pollination with that method (rogue males, wind-borne pollen). So, maybe they were shooting for &quot;red-haired sinse&quot; and ended up calling it that despite it not really being the good, quality seedless stuff. Or maybe it was just dirt brown brick shwag from Mexico that they were selling clueless teenagers...it did have red hairs, but it wasn&#39;t all that potent. And it was always compressed.</p>

<p>Just happy the quality has improved over time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s my two cents. Just to jump to another drug for a second, Cocaine was bad, but used by the upper and middle classes so it was hard to demonise. Along comes the crack cocaine epidemic to show that crack makes people into monsters. Much easier to target crack and sell the story to the public. So back to weed, Cannabis was used by black and white people, but to make it into something monstrous we got Marijuana, the bad mexican variant.
Now that most people realise cannabis isn&#39;t the demon our parents talked about, along comes Skunk, the new demon. 
Its all bullshit. Its marketing pure and simple. You need to create this demon and sell it to the sheep </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That was my comment. And while I fully understand that high potency marijuana cultivation has been going on as long as there have been interested gardeners that like to smoke pot, high potency pot&#39;s relative availability has skyrocketed over the years.</p>

<p>I also grew up in the 80&#39;s. And I read High Times back then. Iirc, High Times started in the late 70&#39;s, and they were showcasing hand cultivated pot long before it was generally available. By the early 90&#39;s you could find high test if you knew where to look, but it wasn&#39;t until the 00&#39;s that it was literally everywhere.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I often wonder if the potency is too much, in favour of THC. One hit and I&#39;m fucked, and on the brink of a panic attack. I like that, soon, I&#39;ll be able to select an exact strain that has a good amount of CBD, which to me seems like a more balanced plant, closer to its natural state. This is all speculation on my part though. </p>

<p>I have found that edibles are much better for someone like me, who can get paranoid quite easily from weed. The high doesn&#39;t hit quite as fast and hard, so I&#39;m eased into it. Lastnight, I ate 1/4 of a cookie and felt great. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it is possible that modern strains have higher THC than in the past due to selective breeding (in the range of 10% more, roughly double maybe) but when it is presented as a problem that I disagree. E.g. &quot;Weed today is much stronger than before, more psychological problems, therefore not a &quot;natural plant&quot; and must be controlled for safety reasons.&quot;</p>

<p>That is BS because weed has been concentrated into hash for many hundreds if not thousands of years, so the THC concentration in any particular strain is going to be significantly less than than the concentrated form, so there is no &quot;new&quot; problem with stronger strains. People have always smoked hash, especially in Europe and the Middle East.</p>

<p>IMO, any increase in pot related mental problems is due to an increase in meth usage. That stuff can do some damage, and I&#39;ve heard, and find plausible, that combining weed and meth usage can trigger mental problems.</p>

I know for a fact that my wife has never used meth, but a strong sativa will make her paranoid as hell.  She is much better with indicas.</p>

<p>Weed, like anything else, is not for everyone.  Some people are going to have bad reactions to it.</p>

<p>Hell, I got prescribed Paxil 20 years ago and it made me feel like absolute shit, mentally.   Brain chemistry is highly individual.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s a fact that proper strains have been selectively bred for higher potency (and more recently, lots of other things) year after year after year. There&#39;s a reason why millions of privatized money is being dumped into cannabis genetics.</p>

<p>Of course, we&#39;ve always had good strains, afterall, where do you think our modern day genotypes/phenotypes come from? They&#39;ve just been few and far between and very regional - like I saw you mention Hawaii, for instance, and Afghani. Then on the other hand you have the complete schwag bail weed that was much more prevalent back then.</p>

<p>But, yeah, that 30-50x number is bullshit. The most potent cannabis I&#39;ve seen these days is hovering just under 30%. So take that, and figure that back in the 60s and 70s potency, on the average was around 10-15%, we could probably safely say that potency had probably doubled, maybe tripled dealing with both extremes. </p>

Yes lets. I am an experienced grower who is fascinated with the history of cannabis.

This is where the Kush variety comes from, heavy buds nicely spaced on a strong stalk. Hash is a potent high THC product.
I think the only truth to this claim is that in the past decades many growers were selective breeding high THC yielding plants with no regard for CBD, CBN, etc. Fortunately that way of thinking has reversed and now people want a nice balanced medical effect. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>To really understand how far back the Cannabis conspiracy goes, check out <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus+30&amp;amp;version=KJ21">https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus+30&amp;version=KJ21</a></p>

<p>It&#39;s not clear what I&#39;m even getting at at first, so check out the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_anointing_oil">wikipedia article about the anointing oil being discussed</a></p>

<p>Specifically, the ingredient &quot;Kaneh bosem&quot;, which has been described as an &quot;aromatic grass&quot;.</p>

<p>Most English translations sneakily choose to translate this as &quot;Cinnamon&quot; or &quot;Calamus&quot;, other fragrant plants.</p>

<p>If you&#39;ve experienced them yourself, and you think about that verse in the context of everything for more than 30 seconds, it seems ridiculous to think that a &quot;holy anointing oil&quot; that brings the priests &quot;closer to God&quot; <em>doesn&#39;t</em> contain an ingredient with psychoactive properties.</p>

<p>Now, take it a step further. Understand that &quot;Christ&quot; literally means &quot;anointed one&quot;. Meaning he got his title that his religion is named after from being anointed with this oil, which most likely contained cannabis.</p>

<p>And it&#39;s not a far stretch from there when you realize that throughout the gospels Jesus is basically going around acting like a giant stoner, telling everyone to love everyone and quit being such dicks.</p>

<p>So, to make this comment relevant to your post, cannabis was at least strong enough on it&#39;s own several thousand years ago that it helped contribute to religions that are still followed to this day.</p>

<p><em>But lets go even further.</em></p>

<p>Ever wonder about the &quot;burning bush&quot;? Ever smoked DMT? Know where it comes from?</p>

<p>DMT is in everything, including our brains. It is more present in certain plants. One plant in particular that contains large amounts of it is Acacia, which is mentioned frequently in the old testament. Hell, it&#39;s what the Ark of the Covenant was built out of. The story of the burning bush is fairly literal. Moses caught enough of the smoke that he tripped BALLS and probably really had a conversation with &quot;I Am&quot;</p>

<p>Drugs play a major, positive role in our society, and they always have. I shed the D.A.R.E. programming and stopped giving a fuck about my parents judging my, and my life is going fantastically. I&#39;ve worked out most of my childhood traumas through various LSD trips. I keep myself from blowing up at and alienating my friends and family by chilling out and smoking a bowl when I&#39;m upset. I work hard every day to keep making salary so that I can afford to continue to smoke and take psychedelics.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve avoided the dangerous stuff like heroin, and as a result, all of the problems I&#39;ve experienced as a result of drugs have not been from the drugs themselves, but the drug war and the anti-drug sentiment.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Grower for 20+ years here. Cannabis is indeed more potent than it was. However, that&#39;s a good thing. Up until 20 or 30 years ago there were only wild-grown strains. I&#39;ll spare the details but in summary what&#39;s happened is a perfectly natural progression. We&#39;ve hybridized. We&#39;ve bred strain after strain, over and over, backcrossed again and again to create better, more potent, more resilient strains. This has been done by countless individuals in private settings over decades. The result is cannabis that&#39;s more flavorful and efficient. You smoke less and enjoy it for longer.</p>

Geography plays a role too, I&#39;m sure someone living in Southern California has grater access to higher quality weed than someone who lives in Oklahoma or something like that, my friend from Michigan said he&#39;d have to drive 3 hours if he wanted to go to a clinic so he was stuck with buying from a dealer who grew his own stuff and it wasn&#39;t that good. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>As far as potency goes, it would make sense from an evolutionary standpoint that humans at some point in time began harvesting marijuana and regrowing it based on the plants THC properties (Plant X gets you higher than Plant Y, so let&#39;s grow more Plant X). this causes the specie&#39;s genome to adapt over time through human artificial selection.

    <div class="md"><p>So the issue with potency is genetic diversity of cannabinoids and terpenes that give cannabis its actual effects. THC is only one of many components within cannabis that has medicinal benefit.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a wide range of other cannabinoids and their precursors including CBD, CBG, CBDA, THCA, THCV, etc. All of which have different effects, and different levels of psycho-activity. In fact, some of them are really grounding, and counter the effects of THC and can totally cap or mellow out a THC high.</p>

<p>THCA which is the precursor to THC is NOT psycho-active, but has almost all the same medical benefits of anti-inflammation, neuro-protection, and anti-microbial effects. If you take THCA while you&#39;re already high on THC it will actually ground your high. The same is similarly true of CBD, CBD and THC have a synergistic effect and if you take more CBD then THC it also grounds the high from THC, as CBD is mostly non-psycho-active.</p>

<p>What happened during prohibition was we lost most of the genetic diversity of cannabis, as people were specifically breeding high THC strains as those are what got consumers high. So arguably, the blackmarket actually pushed THC higher, while not considering other cannabinoids. They did this because at the time people were mostly just smoking cannabis to get high, and not consuming it medicinally through edibles or tinctures. This is what the market demanded, so the growers simply followed the demand.</p>

<p>Previous to prohibition one of the primary forms of consuming cannabis was through tincture. Eli Lilly for example even use to sell cannabis tinctures back in the day.</p>

<p>Where we are at today with genetic testing, and more advanced growing technology including indoor growing we&#39;re able to pretty much grow for whatever characteristics and qualities we desire as long as we have the available seeds to grow from.</p>

<p>I can&#39;t say specifically what cannabis was like in the past, as I wasn&#39;t alive until the 80&#39;s personally, but I would assume plants were breed for THC content, and likely not very healthy or genetically diverse for other cannabinoids.</p>

<p>Previous to prohibition, naturally occurring cannabis was likely much more full spectrum with more equal ratios of most of the cannabinoids present and probably didn&#39;t even really get you high as we know it today with considerable variety between the several different genetic subtypes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There was potent stuff around say in 1970, and thousands of years before that. Skunk #1 was a huge tech advancement for growers, as it combined Afghani and a couple Sativas- one of them being Acapulco Gold. </p>

<p>Now those pure landraces by themselves are extremely potent. Acapulco Gold is a great Sativa and very frosty. Afghani is a solid indica and very gooey. When they come together you have hybrid vigor and the result is even more potent.</p>

<p>The thing is that most smokers in the 60s and 70s- hell even in the 90s didn&#39;t have access to potent non-compressed strains. Vast majority of smokers were smoking Mexican brick weed, full of stems and seeds. Not even sinsemilla, so the potency was definitely lacking. Sometimes there were even male plants in there. They obviously didn&#39;t cull them- hence the seeds. </p>

<p>That shit was very low potency. Then came the big BC bud boom and people all over America started getting access to indoor grown hybdrid or indica strains- although by the time it got to market it had almost always been screened for kief, effectively &quot;cutting&quot; the pot. </p>

<p>The vast majority of casual consumers have seen the potency of their supply go up exponentially in the past 30 or 40 years.</p>

<p>The best I can recollect it was 1973, the first time I smoked the evil weed.  In this time frame, I have easily consumed more than my weight. Original strains were all old school: Colombian Red Bud, Panama Red, Acapulco Gold, Thai sticks, etc. THC levels were low in comparison to today strains, hovering around 8-10%. Thai sticks were a little different, most were dipped in opium. Most of today&#39;s strains are much higher octane ranging from 15-25% THC. Plants strains are now manipulated&#39; to produce higher levels of THC &amp; CDB&#39;s, along with higher yields and the flavor of the week. Original landrace strains are still available today and can obtained with a little effort. Landrace Thai, a100% sativa, is producing 23-24% THC. </p>

<p>1) The best evidence that human&#39;s have been injesting cannabis forever is that WE HAVE CANNABINOID RECEPTORS IN OUR BRAINS. Just like opium, we evolved alongside these plants and our bodies are optimized to make use of them.</p>

<p>2) The war on drugs was actually started in 1930 by Harry Angslinger; a prohibition agent looking for something else to justify his continued employment after alcohol prohibition was over-turned. Nixon ramped it up in the 70s, but the edifice had already been put in place way before then.</p>

<p>3) Weed is absolutely stronger these days due to the introduction of hydroponic technology. If you can control all the variables that go into plant growth, you can maximize your yields &amp; potency. That combined with new genetics means you&#39;ve got much stronger weed.

<p>If it is more potent, that&#39;s great!  The more potent it is, the less it takes to get the desired effect.  </p>

<p>If someone can take a single puff and feel how they&#39;d like to feel, rather than a joint, that&#39;s a lot better for their lungs.</p>
