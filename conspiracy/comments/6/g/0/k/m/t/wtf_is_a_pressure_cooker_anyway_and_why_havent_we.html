       Yeah terrorists also uses pliers, hammers, nails, screws. So we should ban then too right.
Every time we ban completely normal things in order to protect ourselves, is a score for the terrorists.

       no one is passionate about pressure cookers its about the consequences your way of reasoning has on the freedom of everyone, you represent the masses who vote for ever increasing oppression and fascism, those who continue to sacrifice liberty in the name of security, will have neither one.

       Yeah, and cars bombs are a lot more popular than pressure cookers. We should ban cars, too. Don't forget to ban trucks, too; they ran over a bunch of folks in France with one of those.

       It's not banned, but the "good stuff" will get you on a list, if ordered in large quantities online. at least this is what i think.

       If you order a ton of fertilizer as an individual, yeah, you're getting put on a list. Which is believable.

      <p>
       I would assume if as an individual you ordered 100 pressure cookers and other dangerous materials you would probably be put on a list too.

       No, but there are over 125 types of firearms banned and theres a CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT to own them. My point is why would we continue to allow a stupid piece of cooking tool to exist in the public since terrorists use them so much in such devastating consequences.

       pressure cookers are a standard kitchen item the world over.  It isn't very widely used in the US but banning it would be the equivalent of banning coffee makers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Guess we need to be vigilant against (false flag?) people we see holding a pressure cooker in public in a weird way.  It would be obvious I'd think if I was on a bus and saw someone positioning a pressure cooker.  Don't you feel that is more prudent?

       I agree. The campaign of "see something say something" is a false flag. No one ever "does anything" about the things people see or say. Proof is that we are still here debating this issue. 
I see a stupid cooking tool being used to kill innocent children and people by terrorists.
      </p>

       I say something like hey, don't you think we should ban them?

       no, see something say something is good.  If I see some guy messing with a pressure cooker in public, I am sure heck going to strike up a conversation with the guy.

       Sounds like you are trying hyperbole to explain why the 125 banned weapons (are they assault rifles or something?) should not be banned.  Guessing a good way to do it would be to change those laws.

       you can't see them when they use backpacks to move and place them in crowded areas or just blow themselves up.

       And the banned weapons have a constitutional basis for existing and being in my hands but pressure cookers do not.

       Define "Terrorist" ?  Banning anything will be a useless gesture. IT didn't work for any other thing (drugs, guns ...etc) so what makes you think that banning pressure cookers will be any better?

       you're wrong about that last part. They find us infidels regardless because of our economic power or that the majority of country is Christian or Atheist (basically not Muslim). There isnt a heavy military presence in the middle east yet they have attacked Europe with more ferocity than the US, because we have similar ideals. You are waayyy off.

       No, I am not. You need to think in bigger terms than your own family. Think in historical terms. The United States has been killing people in foreign countries for over
       <em>
        one hundred years
       </em>
       . Some people in those countries have long memories. And it is not just in the Middle East.

       a simple flight takes care of the ocean problem. Secondly, how does Europe's past have anything to do with the current terrorist problem. The reason they have more attacks is because they are more lax on immigration into the EU vs. US. you are a ridiculous individual.

       will help with the first part of your post. You can type "what is a pressure cooker," and all sorts of information will be displayed on that screen for you.

       Figuring out what they are will probably answer your second question.

       If you still have any questions, please note that you can use kitchen knives and cars as they did in London so unless you plan on banning everything but sponges and silly putty...I don't know what to tell you.

       This is just a silly question. By this logic we should just ban everything.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've read your other responses, and I get your point. We're all too eager to ban lots of things but not pressure cookers. Banning pressure cookers does not further the agenda. Banning those other things does. That's the difference. And I agree. It's bullshit.

       Yeah, i get it. My point is we ban lots of guns, that are constitutionally protected because some of them can be used in horrific ways to kill many, many people at one time.  so.....

       why not pressure cookers too at this point in time they are used the same way and are but one devastating tool for terror.

       <p>
        My point is we ban lots of guns
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The United States has some of the most lax gun laws in the world, and many of the "banned guns" are done by state laws.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regardless, the reason many of those guns are banned is simply because the amount of people you can harm vs the practicality of one's reasonable need for a gun.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's hard to argue, for example, that you need your own F-16 and a machine gun mounted onto the roof of your home.

       So you're in favor of the 1st amendment right to privacy but against the 2nd amendment right to carry "arms" which does not specify what "arms" are...

       but certainly guns are more constitutionally protected than pressure cookers LOL.

       It's a steel container in it's most basic form.

      <p>
       Banning them would be about as fucking handy as banning chef's knives.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why use them?  Because that seal.  Find another latching top steel vessel and you can do the same thing.  Not that many options around, and it's not like someone is going to weld shut a standard pot/lid combo with fucking explosives inside.

       I don't think the number of pressure cookers sold comes anywhere near 1:1,000,000 ratio to cars sold. But see your point. So we should then allow all weapons that have been created, nuclear, assault rifles, chemical weapons etc. to be sold to the public right?

       Should the majority suffer for what a minority does? I don't believe so, take guns for-example just like cars or even pressure cookers. The amount of those items used in crimes is extremely low compared to the amount of them not used in crimes and are used for their proper purpose. Looks like you go from 0-Hyperbole real quick.. Casio watches are used in IED's should those be banned as well? lol

       Boy you're dense.. They are constitutionally protected from people such as yourself because it is understood that they shouldn't be revoked do to the actions of a few. Please go back to whatever communist circle jerk you are used to dealing with.. Until you actually can make an argument above a 10th grade level.

       The point you fail to grasp is that they are still allowed in the greater whole of society? Which is what you are asking to ban. So sorry if you can't grasp the concept of Public and Private.. A private business such as an airline can ban what they want. If I choose to use a pressure cooker to cook my food in my house I should be allowed to do so. DUH

       Besides its just a container with a tight lid plenty of substitutes are available, if you start analyze the problem from the other side you call for a ban on pressure cookers can not be taken seriously.

       Because c-4 is designed to explode. A pressure cooker is not. I could kill someone with a dildo, doesn't mean it should be banned.

       I'm not okay with terrorists period. Much less ones that try to cook the hardware aisle in a crowded place.
      </p>
      <p>
       I just don't think that banning an instrument of cuisine is going to stop them from doing what they do. They'll find something else, always. They aren't just gonna go home. We blew that shit up already. So what would you ban next?

       Ive also just been informed that pressure cookers prevent botulism in the canning of highly acidic fruits and vegetables. AKA most of your canned goods. Still questioning the usefulness of a pressure cooker? They are amazing in the kitchen. Just look up the recipes!

       That doesn't help your argument. Your talking to a guy that thinks all drugs should be legal. I think it's stupid to ban anything less than a nuclear bomb

       Yeah, they aren't allowed on airplanes.... I'm fine with banning pressure cookers for carry on luggage, but that's not what you're saying...  you can still buy box cutters at any hardware store.

       Why? BC of terrorism.  So my point is just ban pressure cookers so we can start to fight the tools of terrorism in the real world too.

       Boy you're dense.. They are constitutionally protected from people such as yourself because it is understood that they shouldn't be revoked do to the actions of a few. Please go back to whatever communist circle jerk you are used to dealing with.. Until you actually can make an argument above a 10th grade level.
