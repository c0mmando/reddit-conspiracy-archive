       I've asked on
       <a href="/r/C_S_T">
        /r/C_S_T
       </a>
       , and
       <a href="/r/holofractal">
        /r/holofractal
       </a>
       , and no one has known, so maybe you guys will.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's this guy, Nassim Haramein, who created the holographic universe theory, and he is super into the esoteric as well. He's revolutionizing physics, has proven verticular motion in black holes, has shown the energy density of a proton is equivalent to the mass of the universe, just a lot of stuff.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyways, that's the surface stuff that he talks about, but he goes into a lot of weird things as well. Like, at the end of talks that have lasted 4-8 hours each (
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPy-PpIh57s">
        here's the shortened version
       </a>
       ), on a couple of videos I've found he talks about the ark of the covenant having been a gravity generator of sorts, and the vids almost always end with him saying that the ark has been in each great civilization throughout its history, starting with the Sumerians, back when it was just The Black Crystal, not the Ark, which happened when Moses stole it from Egypt, causing their collapse and decline. He says that it can be traced to the modern day, but I can't find a published talk of his that goes into detail..
      </p>
      <p>
       I found a video last night (linked above) with a tiny bit more, but all he said is that you can tell roughly where the thing has gone by tracing the appearance of tetrahedron arrays in history, like the Black Star in Sumeria, some Egyptian version, the Star of Bethlehem, to the Star of David, to the stars in the US flag, all the way to (I assume), the Israeli flag. It's a way to say "I control the ark of the covenant".
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe that's why Israel can be so evil and get away with it?
      </p>
      <p>
       I would really like more information on how he came to his conclusions..

       I found the info I was looking for, if you're interested! It's neat. Apparently the Sumerians are the first record of the object, then it goes to Egypt, then to Jerusalem, then from there it gets taken by the Templars in a neato coup, they create Gothic architecture, they gain a ton of power, they get targeted by the king and the pope, they secret the treasure away in a wagon of hay, taking it to surrounding nations, upon which time the created the Rosicrucian and Freemason orders (whose last initiation rites involve bowing before a replica of the ark, to this day), they transport it to Ethiopia of all places, where it now resides under the care of a procession of single dudes who are pure of heart.

       Brilliant people are often eccentric or have unusual phobias or exotic hobbies and there's that old adage about the fine line that exists between "genius and insanity" that's been around long enough that there has to more more than just a little bit of truth to it.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the realm of theorizing, as long as there's nothing that actually or physically contradicts some idea it still has some potential to be realized. I believe it's no more than a pet theory Haramein has due the common appearance of certain geometric stars, as you say, in the history of great empires, but such designs are as old as geometry itself and I'm sure we went looking we'd find just as many examples in some not so great and short lived empires as well.

       Downvoted, cool. It's a big surprise that universities don't want to bring on a controversial faculty member? Not to mention that there are very real financial incentives to propogate the standard model, just look at CERN's budget. They discussed CERN at Bilderberg this very week. If you want to downvote at least participate.

       “The degree of efficiency is mind-boggling,” said Jacob Bourjaily, a theoretical physicist at Harvard University and one of the researchers who developed the new idea. “You can easily do, on paper, computations that were infeasible even with a computer before.”
      </p>
      <p>
       The new geometric version of quantum field theory could also facilitate the search for a theory of quantum gravity that would seamlessly connect the large- and small-scale pictures of the universe. Attempts thus far to incorporate gravity into the laws of physics at the quantum scale have run up against nonsensical infinities and deep paradoxes. The amplituhedron, or a similar geometric object, could help by removing two deeply rooted principles of physics: locality and unitarity.

       Hi. They always put things out there in symbols. This is part of the Magickal process. The public never figures anything out, but since it has been put into the mass subconscious the black magicians can proceed. This needs much more research. Lets see were it goes.

       I found the info I was looking for, if you're interested! It's neat. Apparently the Sumerians are the first record of the object, then it goes to Egypt, then to Jerusalem, then from there it gets taken by the Templars in a neato coup, they create Gothic architecture, they gain a ton of power, they get targeted by the king and the pope, they secret the treasure away in a wagon of hay, taking it to surrounding nations, upon which time the created the Rosicrucian and Freemason orders (whose last initiation rites involve bowing before a replica of the ark, to this day), they transport it to Ethiopia of all places, where it now resides under the care of a procession of single dudes who are pure of heart.
