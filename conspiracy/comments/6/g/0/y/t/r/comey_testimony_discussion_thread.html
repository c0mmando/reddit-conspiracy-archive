<a href="https://geopolitics.co/2017/03/21/fbi-dir-james-comey-board-member-of-hsbc-clinton-foundation-drug-cartel-launderer/">Comey is likely in the pockets of the Clintons/Deep State</a>  </p>

<p><a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/article/colin-powell-u-n-speech-was-a-great-intelligence-failure/">The Deep state gave &#39;Evidence&#39; to Colin Powell in the past about WMD&#39;s in Iraq, and it was entirely wrong.</a>  </p>

<p>Even if whatever Comey says and believes based on evidence he has been given, it very likely could be fake. Pretty much anything could be created from anything to fool anyone nowadays, as seen in 2003.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Comey has hated the Clintons for a long time, and it&#39;s very clear his letter at the end of the election was enough to sway the 1% of the votes in Michigan to Trump.</p>

<p>The Deep state&#39;s evidence was from the office of special plan.  It doesn&#39;t relate to the FBI.  You are a long time T_D poster spreading FUD because you assume in advance that anything comey could have to say would be negative.</p>

<p>He just asked everybody to leave the room, and told Comey &quot;he hoped&quot; the investigation would be dropped. You know Obama only spoke to Comey a couple times? Because he went through Comey&#39;s boss, the Attorney General. Why didn&#39;t Trump do that, ad instead asked Sessions to leave the room?</p>

<p>Comey would never EVER allow a conflict of interest to develop in an ongoing investigation.

Forget about Comey&#39;s own personal ties with the Deep State and Clinton =] he&#39;s just such an honest guy so it doesn&#39;t matter.</p>

<p>Comey would never EVER allow his superiors to interfere in an investigation, that&#39;s why he was totally okay with Loretta Lynch meeting Bill Clinton on the tarmac.</p>

<p>Comey would never EVER let his own personal opinions influence his actions, that&#39;s why good ole Honest Comey made sure to wait until AFTER he was fired to strike back at Trump, because he was just being honest and doing the right thing and then mean old Trump came down and fired him. Totally unjustified!! Remember Comey is HONEST!!!</p>

<p>Yeah, good old Comey; just making a huge fucking stink over his boss trying to meet with him to discuss matters directly related to his boss&#39; ability to govern. The &quot;OH MY GOD THE RUSSIANS ARE TRYING TO STEAL OUR ELECTION&quot; narrative is <em>totally organic</em> and <em>not a politically motivated witch hunt in any way shape or form.</em> Trump isn&#39;t allowed to ask questions of his subordinates. Especially not Comey. Nope, that sweet, honest man was just trying to do his job.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>So damning? The fact that he came under oath and affirmed with NO DOUBT that Russia interfered int he election and hacked the DNC. </p>

<p>How is that not damning? Witness testimony is actually pretty strong evidence (ESPECIALLY when the witness is this highly regarded) in a court of law. </p>

<p>Even ignoring what Comey said, the leak to the intercept provided further evidence or Russian hacking, not to mention that the entire committee seems to understand that Russia interferred in the election, a collection of Republicans and Democrats (and whatever the hell John McCain is).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So, we&#39;re left with...what exactly? Flynn wasn&#39;t truthful to Pence?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, lying about contacts with Russia and accepting payments from foreign powers (Turkey for instance) to influence American policy is a crime. I know, it&#39;s pretty shocking.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What piece of evidence convinced you about the Russian thing?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m not 100% convinced, but maybe 99%? I find it hard to believe that EVERYONE in those intelligence agencies is lying under oath, and that CrowdStrike is lying (despite seemingly having the trust of the FBI), and that Republicans would support a &quot;false narrative&quot; that Russia helped elect a Republican candidate. Have I seen the actual evidence? </p>

<p>No, but I never saw HRC&#39;s E-mail server either, I never saw the classified documents she supposedly mishandled, but I still believe it happened.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well Comey was only deputy FBI under Bush but neither Bush nor Obama were improperly asking things of Trump, I think that&#39;s why Comey decided to document the conversations. If you look at what Trump was asking of Comey, it&#39;s something that a President shouldn&#39;t be asking. Trump was in the wrong here, not Comey. Attacking Comey for covering his own ass is ridiculous. Trump asked Comey to pledge loyalty and you people are pissed Comey made a record of that? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because I wasn&#39;t arguing whether trump is a liar or not. Obviously he lies. That wasn&#39;t the point I was making at all.</p>

<p>Comey also isn&#39;t in the same situation as trump&#39;s attorneys. He was never in a position where he would require an account of what was said in terms of being the head of the FBI. That is extremely strange. Writing down his thoughts after a discussion wouldn&#39;t help him in his capacity as FBI director. The only way that would matter is if he&#39;s trying to prove something to trump himself but trump doesn&#39;t give a fuck if you catch him in a lie anyway, he&#39;ll just keep lying.</p>

<p>But again, my original point stands that every president lies. If he is afraid of them misremembering or lying he would do that for everyone he talks to. His personal notes are not helping him in his capacity as FBI director either and even now that he has testified they didn&#39;t accomplish anything of the sort he would have claimed he was taking notes for.</p>

<p>He&#39;s the one who brought all this up himself. There was no public account of their conversations before this or even any indication of what they were about. </p>

<p>He said himself he wanted to get it into the public space to get ahead of any potential tapes trump had (which also makes no sense--how would his notes at all refute a recording of their conversations that didn&#39;t support what comey said). But even then what point is there in doing that as ex-FBI director? Why would people need to see his memos or hear his testimony that didn&#39;t lead to anything? </p>

<p>This also provides zero proof that what he is saying is true. So, no, that is not a valid reason for him to have done this. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>What are you even talking about? An inter-agency memo isn&#39;t a legal document. It doesn&#39;t mean anything. If that memo happens to source actual information that is one thing but that is not what we are even talking about. His notes were just a personal account allegedly written from memory. </p>

<p>You don&#39;t seem to be understanding what I&#39;m getting at here either. What purpose does he have for doing this? He said himself that trump wasn&#39;t under investigation for anything. Trump didn&#39;t do anything illegal according to his own memos. Trump wasn&#39;t even president yet at the time so he wasn&#39;t even a government official. What purpose is there for recording this? It actually makes no sense. It serves no purpose to him as FBI director. </p>

<p>Based on what he has said and what has happened he had no legitimate motivation here. Of course he was motivated by something, though, otherwise he wouldn&#39;t have done it. That is what I am getting at. Why did he do it? I&#39;m trying to make sense of the lack of logic and the inconsistencies of his actions and statements. Because if you take it at face value it doesn&#39;t add up.</p>

He said he woke up in the middle of the night (which was also weird to me, makes me wonder if someone called him and told him to act) after trump was tweeting about tapes and it made him remember his notes and realize he should leak it to the press.</p>

<p>Comey saying he hopes trump made tapes doesn&#39;t mean anything. Of course he would say that whether he believed there were tapes or not. It&#39;s not like Trump would need to be egged on to release them if he had them. So if they don&#39;t exist then it makes comey seem more confident in his account being true. If they do exist it wouldn&#39;t matter either way--if they backed up his testimony it wouldn&#39;t matter and if they proved his testimony wrong the tapes would have done that no matter what. There&#39;s no harm in doubling down for comey which is why it doesn&#39;t actually mean anything that he is doing so.</p>

<p>Obviously he doesn&#39;t think trump has any tapes anyway. Otherwise he wouldn&#39;t have done this to begin with. Which brings us back to my point that you glazed over, that he has nothing to lose by saying he&#39;s okay if tapes are released. Either they exist or they don&#39;t. At this point he has nothing to lose in saying that because either they exist and would prove him right, they exist and would prove him wrong, or they don&#39;t exist.

    <div class="md"><p>Perjury is perjury. That is not something that is taken lightly. It doesn&#39;t matter how silly or small the matter was. If your president is lying under oath and otherwise obstructing justice that is a huge fucking deal. At that point it is not about the subject but rather the fact he is willing to do what he did for his own interests. </p>

<p>You can say it was just a blowjob, but that sentiment goes both ways. He was willing to lie over something so small and stupid--imagine what he would do for something even bigger.</p>

<p>Either way that is just one example. Plenty of people have been caught in similar ways and nothing has happened. It blows my mind that people like you will brush that off no matter what political stance you take (I do not take either side). The fact that we have pieces of shit like Clapper testify and outright lie to the public about NSA surveillance and we find out clear as day that it was a lie without anything done to him about it is insane. And then everyone acts like you&#39;re the crazy one for not trusting these people who play the same game.</p>

<p>Unsupported in what way? That is my interpretation. You don&#39;t have to agree with it, but to say it is unsupported is incorrect. It is supported by several instances of this happening where there is no doubt that a politician or law enforcement official has wormed their way through. Not even incompetence can explain this fact.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>At this point, that&#39;s highly debatable. They&#39;re both equally very crooked and sleazy. </p>

<p>... i&#39;d even go so far as to say Trump is slightly worse due to his wonton and flagrant disregard for the law. At least Hillary tried to cover her tracks and be hush hush about it. </p>

<p>Trump is such a prick he brags about how he can get away with shit like &quot;shooting someone on 5th avenue&quot; or grabbing whatever women he pleases even without them wanting it. </p>

<p>Also, the guy is a rapist. Idk why that always gets ignored around here. But he&#39;s been accused of rape and sexual assault by almost as many women as Bill Cosby and that stretches back to even before he became political, which leads me to believe a lot of those are probably true. He&#39;s a real piece of manipulating shit and, honestly, everything people like me have been afraid of in a leader. </p>

<p>I just think Trump is worse. Incompetent. Manipulative. Cult leader. Complete disregard for democracy and the people he is supposed to represent. He doesn&#39;t even try to hide his disdain for us. </p>

<p>That&#39;s a special kind of piece of shit. He belongs in the same category as Erdogan, Mugabe, and Maduro. </p>

<p>Just an absolute disregard and flat out zero respect for civil society. Consumed by his ego. </p>

<p>But it&#39;s fine. We can agree to disagree.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The idea shoved down our throat (for years now) is that we need a relatively centrist candidate to win an election. That&#39;s why the DNC and media pushed Clinton on everyone, because of the idea that someone like Bernie can&#39;t win. Even though he polled better than Hillary against Trump, and someone like Trump did win. </p>

<p>Only when he was the underdog, and Clinton was getting attacked by both sides. Hell, Trump was praising Sanders during the primaries. I wonder why.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Only when he was the underdog&quot; what does that mean? Trump was considered the &quot;underdog&quot; in the primaries despite him consistently polling well, and ended up winning. Then exceeded his expectations from the polling in the general election. Trump praised Sanders to attack Clinton because he knew he wouldn&#39;t be the candidate. Sanders is a populist of the other side, and populism draws people from the whole spectrum. Any idea that Sanders was not the better candidate is delusional at best. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Trump rode a wave of complete horseshit, which Republicans had primed the pump for. They should have shouted him down when he was blathering about Obama&#39;s birth certificate for the last 8 years. It came back to bite them.</p>

<p>Sanders polled well when he wasn&#39;t being attacked. People had a meltdown when two people from the DNC merely discussed, quite briefly, attacking Sanders. I can&#39;t imagine the GOP would have been so generous during the general campaign. Clinton was getting attacked from both Sanders and Trump. Clinton didn&#39;t attack Sanders, because she wanted his voters.</p>

<p>As the underdog, Sanders could make a ton of promises he didn&#39;t need to keep. He was looking to win the primary. Clinton was looking to make campaign promises that would win her a 2nd term in office.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sanders was looking to start a movement that could support his presidency or someone else&#39;s like him (that can hopefully happen down the line). We know that he couldn&#39;t deliver everything he wants on his own. But he could lead us to that direction in the best way possible. And his genuineness is what attracted voters who were sick of establishment types, with many of them joining the Trump camp as a result. Playing it safe like Hillary doesn&#39;t cut it anymore. You have establishment Republicans barely edging out Berniecrats in deeply conservative districts. Access to information and political involvement is booming like never before with our social media. And the only way Hillary types will cut it in 2020 is with the failures of Trump. </p>

<p>What ties it to the Clintons? Mena airport drug-running for Reagan/Bushs Iran-Contra money laundering</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Mena is 242 miles away from where they were found bub. So again, it&#39;s more likely that they stumbled upon something their own corrupt local government was doing and where followed and silenced because of it. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I swear it feels like the same ppl saying &quot;don&#39;t investigate Seth rich! His parents said stop! You are desecrating his life!&quot; Are the same ppl saying not to listen to this guys mom asking for a further investigation</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I swear it&#39;s the same people obssessed over cheese pizza and the DNC are the same people who keep trying to shut down discussion and alternate theories about anything they blame on the Clinton&#39;s </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Idk man why don&#39;t you go ask the kids Mom.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because shes shady as fuck and only does interviews for alt- right websites that pay her cash up front? From what I saw of her AMA, she wasn&#39;t too interested in questions that challenged her own conclusions.</p>

<p>May 3: Comey stated under oath that he never leaked information.

<p>Charges When?</p>

<p>Loretta Lynch asked Comey to downplay Clinton investigation

Comey concerned about Bill Clinton / Lynch meeting</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Trump supporters are running wild with the fact Comey said President wasn&#39;t personally under investigation. Alt-right is hanging on this soundbite hard, yet calling all of Comey&#39;s other statements dishonest. If you&#39;ve been following the Trump/Russia scandal it&#39;s always come down to his close advisors. We&#39;ve seen them begin to fall already, Is that all evidence to simply ignore? </p>

That&#39;s only ONE tool (in regards to Trump tower server talking to Russian bank) which was already proved to be inaccurate before the election.

Everyone else has not been vindicated. Yet Trump wants to brush his shoulders off and claim victory. This investigation is still ongoing as Comey said with confidence Russia interfered succesfully w the election. We will see when it all comes to light, but nice try. </p>

<p>Didn&#39;t seem like a big, urgent issue to them until he became a political liability.</p>

<p>And then Trump was so pissed that his guy lied about his Russian ties that the President tried to get the FBI Director to take it easy on him.  And then the Director was fired shortly after.  And that&#39;s what brings us here today.</p>

<p>There is a reason the Trump administration isn&#39;t claiming that Comey just made it up. Nor will they release any tapes (if they exist). Comey shared these memos before he was fired, they just weren&#39;t publicly leaked until he was fired.</p>

<p>The only solid facts presented so far are emails were leaked that caused distrust with Hillary and the democratic party. Another fact is the Director of the FBI announced more Hillary investigations right before the election which caused distrust with Hillary Clinton. Those are the sole facts I know to be true. People can claim Russia hacked and leaked emails all they want, but that isnt a fact to be proven with evidence currently.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t even vote. Its a waste of time. I understand that if the person who got elected miraculously wasn&#39;t part of the regime he would be killed. Trump works for the same people Hillary does and its all a show.

Yet now he&#39;s part of this Russia show against Trump. </p>

<p>What can we infer from this? The establishment is trying to go after/to war with Russia. This is why they let Trump get elected and not Hillary. You can&#39;t connect Russia to Hillary. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I understand that they stand to benefit if it&#39;s not fake, but that doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s necessarily fake.</p>

<p>There have been a LOT of really shady connections between the Trump administration and Russia and we do know that Russia is was and always will at least try to influence American politics. We even know what their strategy is (use fake news so that people don&#39;t know what&#39;s true, stoke racial tensions (which they already do on their own people and on Americans through RT)).</p>

<p>So rather than jumping to a conclusion we should be waiting for more information as it comes out. This hearing had a chance of giving us more information, unfortunately it didn&#39;t give us much.</p>

<p>Also the people that lied to us about NSA spying, and WMDs in Iraq.</p>

<p>2) They claim that they can tell Russia did this via a sort of &quot;digital fingerprint&quot;. Assuming that has nothing to do with IP addresses that can be easily faked, regardless of if we show the evidence or not, it&#39;s presumed that Russia would change their methods in the future anyways to not be discovered.</p>

<p>3) They can be more forthcoming with information that doesn&#39;t have to reveal anything about the methods. It wouldn&#39;t satisfy me because I&#39;d still want to know how they knew it came from Russia, but where&#39;s the list of &quot;fake news&quot; stories that was so widely disseminated that hurt Hillary?</p>

<p>And everything you say has absolutely nothing to do with what I said.</p>

<p>That&#39;s because we are talking about voters not whatever you want to distract me with. VOTERS are supposed to hold politicians accountable, but they can&#39;t do that if political parties rig the system against them and the politicians lie to them.</p>

<p>I already told you this isn&#39;t &quot;obstruction of justice&quot; in a legal sense regarding the criminal investigation. I said that in my first comment so I&#39;m not sure why you even tried to argue. Thanks for agreeing with me I guess.</p>

<p>However it certainly is an obstruction of justice in the way I described it. If you want to try to argue that American voters shouldn&#39;t be allowed to vote based on the truth then be my guest lol.</p>

<p>Fraud is a crime <a href="https://www.facebook.com/DNCfraudlawsuit/">https://www.facebook.com/DNCfraudlawsuit/</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Like calling an active investigation into the integrity of the election, a cornerstone of the democracy, fake news and trying to stop it?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What are you talking about? I&#39;m literally not sure. The election already had zero integrity. Bernie was cheated by Clinton &amp; the DNC &amp; Trump was elevated via the media (Clinton + DNC plan) <a href="https://twitter.com/wikileaks/status/785615427913199616">https://twitter.com/wikileaks/status/785615427913199616</a></p>

<p>Let&#39;s look back... The first comment I replied to: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Sounds like obstruction of justice to me!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>to wich I replied:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>No, because it doesn&#39;t affect the investigation. Only public statements. An example of obstruction would be more like &quot;please let that investigation go&quot;.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Then I got the following answer:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>That&#39;s where you&#39;re completely backwards.
Loretta Lynch telling Comey to publicly call the FBI&#39;s Hillary investigation a &quot;matter&quot; instead of what it was, is her putting her finger on the scale for political reasons.
She asked him to lie, or mislead, the American public.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>to which I replied:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>is her putting her finger on the scale for political reasons.
Yes it was, and it was certainly not right. But it didn&#39;t have an effect on the conclusion of the investigation. And wasn&#39;t supposed to.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No one was talking about the election or voters.</p>

<p>Then you came into the discussions by shifting the topic to distract me, not the other way round.</p>

<p>I made it my points explicitly clear. I wasn&#39;t talking about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obstruction_of_justice">obstruction of justice</a>. I was talking about <em>obstruction of justice</em> per my argument.</p>

<p>Thank you for agreeing with me that it was not the former, but it definitely is <em>obstruction of justice</em> per my argument.</p>

<p>Or you could just admit that I&#39;m right. Admit that voters do in fact vote for politicians and that we do need the truth in order for democracy to function correctly. And admit that our democracy should not be rigged.</p>

<p>Big imo, also helped to convince people (including myself) that Comey was likely telling the truth during his testimony. He was very candid about testimony regarding people with affiliations with both parties.</p>

There&#39;s a significant problem right now where the entire Democratic process has been hijacked by technocrats, and it&#39;s evident to the populace  that they have no say in the political process (At a national level), but they don&#39;t have a mechanism for actual change. </p>

<p>&quot;Manafort and Davis didn’t just snooker McCain into trumpeting their client’s cause; they endangered him politically, by arranging a series of meetings with Deripaska, who the U.S. had barred from entering the country because of his ties to organized crime. In 2006, they steered McCain to attend a dinner with the oligarch at a chalet near Davos, where Deripaska speechified for the 40 or so guests. (The Washington Post reported that the oligarch sent Davis and Manafort a thank-you note for arranging to see the senator in “such an intimate setting.”) Seven months later, Manafort and Davis took McCain to celebrate his 70th birthday with Deripaska on a yacht moored in the Adriatic.&quot;</p>

<p>Ok last try.
As I understand it, in this context, a &quot;memo&quot; is a &quot;memo to yourself&quot; a memorization of an experienced event. In this case a memo/memorization/recollection of his conversations with Trump.</p>

<p>Those were written right after his conversations with Trump. When Comey did a briefing in the Trump Tower, he stated that he started writing on his classified laptop right after entering his car. </p>

<p>Calling them notes is probably not totally correct but that is about it. Thats all I can say about this.</p>

<p>Sort of. He recused himself, voluntarily. He can easily fuck with anything if he so chooses. The memo being leaked forced a special prosecutor, which is pretty important in this case.</p>

<p>Who would Comey go to? His boss was Sessions. His boss&#39; boss was Trump. This needed a special prosecutor.</p>

<p>It still doesn&#39;t strike you as odd that he gave it to a friend to give to the press? Why wouldn&#39;t he make a general announcement to say it himself? Why manufacture the appearance of a leak?</p>

<p>I mean, maybe somewhat odd, but it seems far more important to verify the authenticity of the documents, and their relative truth which, considering how unequivocally Comey stated he wanted tapes (if they existed) to be released to the public seems to be the case. </p>

<p>In so far as the reason not to make a general announcement? If I had to make a guess, I&#39;m assuming he wanted to (as he stated) ensure the appointment of a special prosecutor, and if he immediately after firing held a press conference and released the memoes, I&#39;m sure many&quot;news organizations&quot; would immediately spin the release and try to discredit him due to the circumstances, which would hinder his ultimate goal of having a special prosecutor put in place.</p>

<p>I&#39;m also assuming that, after his firing, Comey wanted to ensure that someone (who he trusted or viewed as bipartisan maybe?) would take over the investigation, and his prediction worked pretty astoundingly. </p>

<p>Non-committal fashion? That was the most brazen threat I&#39;ve seen a President EVER make in such a public forum. </p>

<p>Well EVERY new bit of information &quot;manipulates&quot; the narrative. Every Wikileaks leak, and Snowden&#39;s bombshells, but again, if the information is TRUE, it&#39;s important that it comes out, regardless of how much it changes perceptions. </p>

<p>I suppose you could try to paint him in a bad light by saying &quot;he had an agenda!&quot; but while that is likely the case, I don&#39;t see why that matters so much. It&#39;s interesting to discuss I suppose, but frankly I don&#39;t really care that much why he did it, as long as what he&#39;s saying is the truth. </p>

<p>There are too many lies out there for me to throw a fit when someone seemingly leaks important truths.</p>

<p>A brazen threat would be &quot;if Comey starts to leak with to the press, I
ll release the tapes I made.&quot; Also, Comey did leak to the press, so where are the tapes? They don&#39;t exist, that&#39;s where, and Comey knows that.</p>

<p>While that&#39;s true, the FBI director chose to create a particular appearance in order to manipulate the narrative. Wikileaks does the same thing, sure, but that doesn&#39;t make it ok that Comey does it.</p>

<p>It matters because he was the director of the FBI. &quot;We&#39;re honest! We&#39;re non-partisan!&quot; Bullshit. Knowing the agenda is key to understanding motive and context. Is it true? Maybe, it&#39;s just Comey&#39;s word and painted by his personal feelings. Why should we trust him when he&#39;s so manipulative? He&#39;s shady, so is Trump, we haven&#39;t heard the truth yet.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I actually think the average person does think Russia and Trump were working hand in hand. The media and Democrats have pushed that narrative, and tried at every turn to link them, that I think the average Jane and Joe believe it. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t think most realize Russia (and many other nations) likely did try and fuck with our election. They&#39;ve tried before, too, and they&#39;ll try again. They&#39;re not doing it to benefit one candidate over another, but instead to benefit themselves. </p>

<p>Comment under HA Goodman&#39;s video:</p>

<p>&quot;So Comey was a leaker, a liar, not loyal, and &quot;not strong&quot; in his own words. Gee, i wonder why Trump fired his bitch-ass.&quot;</p>

Everyone else has not been vindicated. Yet Trump wants to brush his shoulders off and claim victory. This investigation is still ongoing as Comey said with confidence Russia interfered succesfully w the election. We will see when it all comes to light, but nice try. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t think most realize Russia (and many other nations) likely did try and fuck with our election. They&#39;ve tried before, too, and they&#39;ll try again. They&#39;re not doing it to benefit one candidate over another, but instead to benefit themselves. </p>
