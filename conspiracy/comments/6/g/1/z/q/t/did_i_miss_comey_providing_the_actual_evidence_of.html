    <div class="md"><p>No, based on every headline. </p>

<p>As stated earlier in this topic someone stated &quot;remember  Trump is seen as the head of the administration/campaign.&quot; </p>

<p>Trump was told by Comey (and confirmed by Comey&#39;s testimony yesterday) on 3 separate occasions that he(Trump) was not being investigated. All Trump wanted(because of the MSM headlines/stories) was for Comey to announce that he(Trump) was not being investigated, but Comey refused to to say anything because then if something did implicate Trump he would have to &quot;create a duty to correct&quot;. So he didn&#39;t want to say anything because he didn&#39;t want to have to come out an make a correction if something on Trump was found, whaaah. Comey could have issued a statement correcting the narrative the MSM was pushing about Trump (he basically allowed the false/negative stories about Trump colluding with Putin to continue). </p>

<p>Comey says he is for all what is fair and right for America/Americans but not telling the public that Trump was not being investigated was not fair and let the Dems/news continue to push the narrative of Trump/Putin collusion. Do any of you think that was fair and just??</p>

<p>Spin this anyway you like but Comey&#39;s testimony pretty much vindicated Trump and his assertions that he(Trump) was never being investigated for collusion. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well then if it&#39;s based on every headline, surely you can provide an example that definitively states that Trump, himself, personally, is under investigation. </p>

<p>Because what they actually said, I&#39;s that Trumps <em>administration</em> and <em>campaign</em> was under investigation for copulation with Russia. Because they were, as confirmed by Comey&#39;s testimony. And still are. </p>

<p>Not a single reputable headline stated DEFINITIVELY that Trump himself was. You are basing that on your feels.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>*LATE September was a frantic period for New York Times reporters covering the country’s secretive national security apparatus. Working sources at the F.B.I., the C.I.A., Capitol Hill and various intelligence agencies, the team chased several bizarre but provocative leads that, if true, could upend the presidential race. The most serious question raised by the material was this: Did a covert connection exist between Donald Trump and Russian officials trying to influence an American election?</p>

<p>One vein of reporting centered on a possible channel of communication between a Trump organization computer server and a Russian bank with ties to Vladimir Putin. Another source was offering The Times salacious material describing an odd cross-continental dance between Trump and Moscow. <strong>The most damning claim was that Trump was aware of Russia’s efforts to hack Democratic computers</strong>, an allegation with implications of treason. Reporters Eric Lichtblau and Steven Lee Myers led the effort, aided by others.*

<p><em>What is the real story of Donald Trump and Russia?

<p><em>We are only beginning to process the fact that a foreign country interfered with American democratic elections. *</em>But when it comes to Russia and its relationship with Donald Trump, the election hacking may be only the tip of the iceberg*<em>.

<p>In what way has this claim been refuted by Comey&#39;s testimony? In what way does the claim that Trump was <strong>aware</strong> of the efforts suggest that he actively colluded them them?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But there’s no doubt that a spider web of connections—some public, some private, some clear, some murky—exists between Trump** , his associates and Russian President Vladimir Putin*</p>

<p>Same response. Is Trump not connected to his associates? Are Trumps associates (Manafort, Flynn, Sessions) not connected to Russia? No. In fact those connections have been proven.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>But when it comes to Russia and its relationship with Donald Trump, the election hacking may be only the tip of the iceberg</em>*</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Which is why there is still an ongoing investigation involving his campaign. And again, there is literally no claim that Trump personally colluded with Russia in this quote.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Donald Trump&#39;s Pants on Fire claim Russia story &#39;made-up&#39; by Democrats</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Russia story is not made up by democrats, as confirmed by Comey&#39;s testimony.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Here is one story that Mother Jones decided to take down.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Retractions happen. Remember Fox news took down Wheelers bullshit about Seth Rich? IF they were trying to lie to people on purpose they&#39;d leave it up.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Donald Trump and Russia: a web that grows more tangled all the time</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is nothing misleading about that headline. There definitely exists a web of connections between Trump, his admin, and Russia, as I outlined before.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Trump Is Already Guilty of Aiding Putin&#39;s Attack on America</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is the only link you have provided that even remotely supports your claim. Its a shitty headline and a salacious article, in the vein of Breitbart. Though you and I disagree that Motherjones is the &quot;mainstreem media&quot; Its a political blog like Zerohedge. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The only 4 things you need to know about Trump and Russia</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Another example of you not reading the fucking article. From this article you posted:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Trump officials and Russia talked a lot. But about what?
Here&#39;s where things can get a little complicated.
An important reminder right off the top: Connections do not suppose collusion or collaboration. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>If this post was meant to support your point that this is not mostly based on your feels and instead on what the MSM has actually been saying, it is an abject failure.</p>

<p>Have you considered that you might have misinterpreted the headlines (perhaps being misled but others who have an agenda) and don&#39;t really understand why people think this investigation is so important?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, I&#39;ve read many of the misleading stories stating Trump is working with Putin. Just google the story, most MSM/liberal online news outlets implicated Trump as working with Russia. The stories are everywhere. I don&#39;t think you are looking objectionably at this. Thanks for the dialogue though. No name calling as most people do, so I appreciate that. Let&#39;s agree to disagree on the matter. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Trump <strong>is</strong> working with Putin - at least a strongly suspect so. But he doesn&#39;t have to be personally making contact in order to do so.</p>

<p>In fact, unless he&#39;s a complete imbecile (I assume you think he&#39;s not), he will have a wall of plausible deniability between him and any illegal actions.</p>

<p>But, as Nixon showed, that doesn&#39;t really make a difference in the end. The President is responsible for the actions of his staff.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Based on your thoughts you think Trump knows that someone in his campaign was actively working with the Russian government to hack the election in his favor.
 During that dinner when Trump was talking to Comey, Trump stated &quot;that if anyone in his campaign had been working with the Russians he wanted to know&quot;.</p>

<p>Doesn&#39;t sound like something someone would say especially if that someone &quot;knows&quot; his people are colluding with Russia. I would think he is smart enough to know it would come back to him. </p>

<p>Lot&#39;s of people call Trump, dishonest, dumb,stupid, idiot etc... I think he is smarter than most people give him credit for. </p>

<p>Again, there is no evidence that proves he or his campaign ever colluded with Putin/Russian government to hack, steal, flip etc...the election in Trumps favor.
 I do believe the Russians have their own interests in a particular candidate and tried themselves to influence an outcome that they liked, but that also doesn&#39;t mean that if the candidate of their liking did win that it was because of Russian influence. </p>

<p>We have our differences in opinion and I appreciate the dialogue.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>*LATE September was a frantic period for New York Times reporters covering the country’s secretive national security apparatus. Working sources at the F.B.I., the C.I.A., Capitol Hill and various intelligence agencies, the team chased several bizarre but provocative leads that, if true, could upend the presidential race. The most serious question raised by the material was this: Did a covert connection exist between Donald Trump and Russian officials trying to influence an American election?</p>

<p>One vein of reporting centered on a possible channel of communication between a Trump organization computer server and a Russian bank with ties to Vladimir Putin. Another source was offering The Times salacious material describing an odd cross-continental dance between Trump and Moscow. <strong>The most damning claim was that Trump was aware of Russia’s efforts to hack Democratic computers</strong>, an allegation with implications of treason. Reporters Eric Lichtblau and Steven Lee Myers led the effort, aided by others.*

<p><em>What is the real story of Donald Trump and Russia? The answer is still unclear, and Democrats in Congress want to get to the bottom of it with an investigation. *</em>But there’s no doubt that a spider web of connections—some public, some private, some clear, some murky—exists between Trump*<em>, his associates and Russian President Vladimir Putin</em>

<p><em>We are only beginning to process the fact that a foreign country interfered with American democratic elections. *</em>But when it comes to Russia and its relationship with Donald Trump, the election hacking may be only the tip of the iceberg*<em>. The American public doesn&#39;t have access to the data the intelligence community—all 16 agencies combined—have on the Russian government, its banks and oligarchs, and their relationships with Trump&#39;s campaign, his business ventures, and the president-elect himself.</em></p>
