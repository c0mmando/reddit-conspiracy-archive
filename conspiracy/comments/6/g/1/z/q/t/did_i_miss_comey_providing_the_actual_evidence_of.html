       He never said there was no evidence. The only thing remotely comforting that he said for Trump followers is that Trump wasn't under direct investigation himself. No-one really expected that. It's not like Nixon broke into the Watergate hotel himself.

       Can you give an example? All the articles I've read have centered on the Trump campaign and the Trump administration.
      </p>
      <p>
       Keep in mind that Trump is personally responsible for the actions of both. He can have never contacted Russia himself and still end up being impeached over this. Even more so if he tried to cover it up.

       No, based on every headline.
      </p>
      <p>
       As stated earlier in this topic someone stated "remember  Trump is seen as the head of the administration/campaign."
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump was told by Comey (and confirmed by Comey's testimony yesterday) on 3 separate occasions that he(Trump) was not being investigated. All Trump wanted(because of the MSM headlines/stories) was for Comey to announce that he(Trump) was not being investigated, but Comey refused to to say anything because then if something did implicate Trump he would have to "create a duty to correct". So he didn't want to say anything because he didn't want to have to come out an make a correction if something on Trump was found, whaaah. Comey could have issued a statement correcting the narrative the MSM was pushing about Trump (he basically allowed the false/negative stories about Trump colluding with Putin to continue).
      </p>
      <p>
       Comey says he is for all what is fair and right for America/Americans but not telling the public that Trump was not being investigated was not fair and let the Dems/news continue to push the narrative of Trump/Putin collusion. Do any of you think that was fair and just??
      </p>
      <p>
       Spin this anyway you like but Comey's testimony pretty much vindicated Trump and his assertions that he(Trump) was never being investigated for collusion.

       Well then if it's based on every headline, surely you can provide an example that definitively states that Trump, himself, personally, is under investigation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Because what they actually said, I's that Trumps
       <em>
        administration
       </em>
       and
       <em>
        campaign
       </em>
       was under investigation for copulation with Russia. Because they were, as confirmed by Comey's testimony. And still are.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not a single reputable headline stated DEFINITIVELY that Trump himself was. You are basing that on your feels.

       *LATE September was a frantic period for New York Times reporters covering the country’s secretive national security apparatus. Working sources at the F.B.I., the C.I.A., Capitol Hill and various intelligence agencies, the team chased several bizarre but provocative leads that, if true, could upend the presidential race. The most serious question raised by the material was this: Did a covert connection exist between Donald Trump and Russian officials trying to influence an American election?
      </p>
      <p>
       One vein of reporting centered on a possible channel of communication between a Trump organization computer server and a Russian bank with ties to Vladimir Putin. Another source was offering The Times salacious material describing an odd cross-continental dance between Trump and Moscow.
       <strong>
        The most damning claim was that Trump was aware of Russia’s efforts to hack Democratic computers
       </strong>
       , an allegation with implications of treason. Reporters Eric Lichtblau and Steven Lee Myers led the effort, aided by others.*

       of the efforts suggest that he actively colluded them them?

       Same response. Is Trump not connected to his associates? Are Trumps associates (Manafort, Flynn, Sessions) not connected to Russia? No. In fact those connections have been proven.

       Which is why there is still an ongoing investigation involving his campaign. And again, there is literally no claim that Trump personally colluded with Russia in this quote.

       This is the only link you have provided that even remotely supports your claim. Its a shitty headline and a salacious article, in the vein of Breitbart. Though you and I disagree that Motherjones is the "mainstreem media" Its a political blog like Zerohedge.

       No, I've read many of the misleading stories stating Trump is working with Putin. Just google the story, most MSM/liberal online news outlets implicated Trump as working with Russia. The stories are everywhere. I don't think you are looking objectionably at this. Thanks for the dialogue though. No name calling as most people do, so I appreciate that. Let's agree to disagree on the matter.

       Trump
       <strong>
        is

       working with Putin - at least a strongly suspect so. But he doesn't have to be personally making contact in order to do so.
      </p>
      <p>
       In fact, unless he's a complete imbecile (I assume you think he's not), he will have a wall of plausible deniability between him and any illegal actions.

       Based on your thoughts you think Trump knows that someone in his campaign was actively working with the Russian government to hack the election in his favor.
 During that dinner when Trump was talking to Comey, Trump stated "that if anyone in his campaign had been working with the Russians he wanted to know".
      </p>
      <p>
       Doesn't sound like something someone would say especially if that someone "knows" his people are colluding with Russia. I would think he is smart enough to know it would come back to him.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lot's of people call Trump, dishonest, dumb,stupid, idiot etc... I think he is smarter than most people give him credit for.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, there is no evidence that proves he or his campaign ever colluded with Putin/Russian government to hack, steal, flip etc...the election in Trumps favor.
 I do believe the Russians have their own interests in a particular candidate and tried themselves to influence an outcome that they liked, but that also doesn't mean that if the candidate of their liking did win that it was because of Russian influence.

       It's over, the president has been vindicated, proving that the DNC colluded with MSM on a political witch hunt to undermine the new administration. We all knew that there was a conspiracy here and that it was the drilled left, this just proves it. And now that Jeff Sessions froze Obamas slush fund, maybe r/conspiracy won't be bombarded my Media Matters and ShariaBlue anymore. Thank god and good riddance.

       The Russia collusion investigation is separate from the Flynn investigation. It is the latter that we now have sworn testimony explicitly stating that Trump seeked to obstruct. That is an impeachable offense. These are all objective facts.

       He underperformed the S&amp;P. My investments have outperformed the market for over a decade. If my father had given me tens of millions of dollars, and co-signed for hundreds of millions of dollars of loans, I'm positive I would have done much better than Trump did.

       The Russia collusion investigation is separate from the Flynn investigation. The latter is the one Comey said Trump attempted to obstruct. You should leave your echo chamber sometime, as you clearly don't have all the facts.

       Everything you say is true which leads to the conclusion that I do believe that Trump was flat out lying to Comey.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do think that Trump believes himself to be an able enough negotiator and "nimble navigator" to avoid this coming back to him. Every person he's fired or who has left in disgrace, he has publicly backed until the day he didn't.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think he'll publicly say he wants this to be rooted out of his staff until he's called to testify under oath when suddenly his memory will become faulty.

       He never said there was no evidence. The only thing remotely comforting that he said for Trump followers is that Trump wasn't under direct investigation himself. No-one really expected that. It's not like Nixon broke into the Watergate hotel himself.

       Can you give an example? All the articles I've read have centered on the Trump campaign and the Trump administration.
      </p>
      <p>
       Keep in mind that Trump is personally responsible for the actions of both. He can have never contacted Russia himself and still end up being impeached over this. Even more so if he tried to cover it up.

       *LATE September was a frantic period for New York Times reporters covering the country’s secretive national security apparatus. Working sources at the F.B.I., the C.I.A., Capitol Hill and various intelligence agencies, the team chased several bizarre but provocative leads that, if true, could upend the presidential race. The most serious question raised by the material was this: Did a covert connection exist between Donald Trump and Russian officials trying to influence an American election?
      </p>
      <p>
       One vein of reporting centered on a possible channel of communication between a Trump organization computer server and a Russian bank with ties to Vladimir Putin. Another source was offering The Times salacious material describing an odd cross-continental dance between Trump and Moscow.
       <strong>
        The most damning claim was that Trump was aware of Russia’s efforts to hack Democratic computers
       </strong>
       , an allegation with implications of treason. Reporters Eric Lichtblau and Steven Lee Myers led the effort, aided by others.*
