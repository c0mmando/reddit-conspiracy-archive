    <div class="md"><p>I have worked in gaming almost 20 years, and explained how the math algorithm works, and no one believes me. I can draw simple examples on a napkin, in simple ways, and no one believes it anyways. On top of that, i work with many developers, some who still gamble, knowing what is behind the curtain anyways! I have to believe it wasnt that statement that got you escorted. Might have been location. Like, if you were at the Keno board speaking loudly about how its the worst odds of any game in the casino. Or you were at the Blackjack table, third base, and burning the cards and explaining that if you dont know how to play Blackjack, you can screw over your fellow players by playing stupid. Add alcohol and , well you get the idea. Remember this, when a casino says 96% payback, they mean that for every 1.00 you put in, you have a chance of winning back .96 cents, or less. Its meaningless without context.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>1example: reels, or virtual reels. Let&#39;s say reel 1 has 30 stops. 30 pictures including the blanks in between. Even digital, for this example. Reel 2 can have many stops. They all can, if they digital right? Anyways, reel 1, 30 stops. Now, that gives you a 1in 30 chance to hit the jackpot(with Max bet of course). Not true. They can assign a matrix of numbers, let&#39;s say 30,000, it matches the 30. So the blanks get assigned a value of up to 1000 each (just as an example, they can assign values as they want, as long as it&#39;s within regulated zones) just for this example. That&#39;s 15000 assigned for each blank. We still have 15k leftover for winning! Woohoo! The mathematician will assign the other 15k as befits the wins, more for the lowest wins, and maybe a value of 1 or 10 for the jackpot.So now, they do this for the other reels, set them as they need too, to make the regulation. I only mentioned 30 stops, because it&#39;s an easy number. There are slot machines that have hundreds of slots, all different per reel. Anyone that is a professional slot gambler, work in packs. They come down and gamble on slots, just spamming them, because the jackpot is higher than it should be.  It&#39;s simply a luck game. No strategy. You could spin a reel 10 times in a row and hit a jackpot, but it&#39;s not likely. Sometimes people hit jackpots with minimum coin, which still contributes to the progressive, and this just adds to the FUN! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Im not a mathematician, Im sorry.Suffice to say, corporations that produce video slot machines for sale around the world hire people that are really good at making spreadsheets with lots of odds. These odds, and hundreds of thousands of simulations to meet regulated minimums and maximums, allow these games to be released. The odds they create are within industry standards. These same odds are not in your favor. Think of gambling like it was at Chuckee Cheese. You want an Xbox1? Well it will take you only 50k tickets, each ticket worth .25! Its a deal, and gambling is for entertainment purposes only! I encourage, actually, require, that people continue to gamble. Im probably wrong on everything ive posted, but i to appreciate everyone that takes that chance.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You aren&#39;t speaking intelligently about this. Familarize yourself with advantage play concepts. I used to hustle slots in vegas and other areas for a living. I still do from time to time. There are plenty of games designed in such a away that if the player understands the game, can calculate  a positive expected return.  The player knows he temporarily has an edge, and only plays when he has a statistical edge. What you&#39;ve not considered is that casinos often provide ourside positive EV in the form of promotions.  Advantage players capitalize on them as well. I will give you one example, but will not reveal trade secrets. </p>

<p>Example:</p>

<p>Casino offers new player sign up bonus of $500. Stipulates if player loses 500$ casino will give player 500$ in casino free play.  An advantge player would then use a game that allows him to leave equity in the game that can be recovered at a later time. Good example of this is Ultimate X video poker. Player can use this game to setup a temporary equity holding, remove is players card (establishing a loss) and then playing temporarily to recapture the equity. Rinse repeat.  Casino believes player lost 500, when he maybe only really lost 100 to 150$, or maybe he actually won a profit during the process. Casino then gives player 500$ in freeplay, and he proceeds to play it off on a different video poker machine that pays back 90%+. Player has a huge +EV due to the 500$ in free equity provides by the casino. Player probably nets 300-400 on avg in that exchange. There are a relatively small group of people that are much smarter than casinos and game designers. I imagine you aren&#39;t one of those people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I went to a casino once... Sat down at the blackjack table with a few people. I have no idea how to count cards or anything like that. I was very buzzed and thought it would be a good idea to just randomly sit out on hands. Think I went from like $10 in chips to $80 in like 10 hands where I skipped 3 random hands. They next hand I skipped some guy in a suit walked over and was standing behind me. I looked at him and laughed in his face and left. Fuck casinos. If you see playing any game on a machine or a card game with an auto shuffling machine you are getting played.  They have profit margins designed into the shuffling/machine algorithms. As soon as you effect those algorithms in any way they have to stop you. Even if you have no strategy at all. You have to play a certain way or they kick you out.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah it not only depends on what you have but also what the dealer has showing. Having your bottom card hidden doesn&#39;t even matter for you but it matters a great deal for the dealer.

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s a set of rules that should be followed exactly, and that depends on your card and the dealer&#39;s card.  If your not counting cards, and you follow this &quot;rule book&quot; perfectly, you narrow down the odds to pretty close to 50/50, but the odds still favor the dealer.  </p>

<p>If there are certain cards left in the deck, the odds are actually in your favor, sometimes by alot.  The problem is, you never know when this is.</p>

<p>However, if you can count cards, you can know when the odds are in your favor, and increase your bet.  Then when the odds are in the dealer&#39;s favor, you decrease your bet, or leave the table.  There&#39;s different counting methods.  Some are easier than others.  The harder the method, the more precise, and the more accurately you can tell just how much the odds are in the favor of either the dealer or yourself.</p>

<p>Casinos know this, so if you&#39;re randomly sitting out hands, or constantly changing the amount you bet, they will know you&#39;re counting cards and kick you out.  One way around this is to have a card counter sit down at a table, and bet as little as possible, and the same amount each time.  Then when the odds are heavily in the player&#39;s favor, say 70% vs 30%, he sends a discreet signal, and someone else sits down, and plays like 5 hands, betting big money each time, then gets up and leaves.  The casino just thinks he&#39;s a whale who got lucky.</p>

<p>The more decks the casino uses, the better for the card counting team, because there&#39;s higher potential for massive swings in odds, which is what you want.  </p>

<p>I&#39;ve practiced heavily not just with counting cards, but with drinking and carrying on a conversation without anyone noticing I&#39;m counting.  This is what&#39;s required.  You need teams of 2 though nowadays, and obviously only 1 of the guys has to be proficient at counting.  The other guy just has to have the &quot;rule book&quot; memorized, which isn&#39;t too difficult.  </p>

<p>There&#39;s teams who still make millions doing this, but you need a significant payroll to start with, because to make alot you need to wager alot, and there could be days where you lose a quarter million dollars, but over time you will absolutely make money.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I realize the method doesn&#39;t change, but first, you have to be able to start with the funds to bet properly for the entire shoe. There is more chance of a long run of losing hands with ten decks, so doubling and tripling during a series of losses, not to mention taking advantage of double down situations gets prohibitive. There is also more possibility of other players taking bad hits/passes and messing up the odds just because of the length of time it takes to get through the entire shoe. Believe me, there is a reason that it&#39;s tough to find casinos that play with three or fewer decks. It was a lot easier to win twenty years ago when that was the norm. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What would you like to know? Every casino has player tracking systems that are used for all kinds of things. They aren&#39;t necessarily something to be <em>that</em> paranoid about, but they will mine the data of everything you do while there in order to determine behavioral patterns that can be used to increase the amount of money people will spend during a visit, and to determine how much a player is worth to the house, so that they can tailor incentives to increase that value. </p>

<p>Like, if the house can figure out how to spend 100 bucks to make you stay longer and play more, to spend 200 bucks more than your Average Daily Theoretical value, then that is 100 bucks well spent. Or, if they gotta spend 10 bucks to realize you aren&#39;t worth a dime, also money well spent. </p>

<p>So, every quarter you play, how fast you played them, when you played it, what machine it was on, what part of the casino it was in, what kind of game it was...all these little details get factored in to figure out how to incentivise you to play more. And some of the stuff they are working on now is just going to go further in leveraging data. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>At the end of the day, the amount of comps you are going to get is going to be dependent on your value to the casino. So, unless you are playing aggressively, if you have no history with the casino you aren&#39;t really going to get anything really valuable. There are people that play the loyalty rewards systems like others play blackjack though. That will bust out a spreadsheet at the player&#39;s club to explain they are due 1000294 drawing tickets for the Camaro, but are only showing 1000292 tickets in their account haha.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t take me as definitive, I was somewhat an outsider to gaming up until a couple years ago myself. But it seems to me, your best bet is to do some research on the different casino rewards programs. Find the one with rules that most benefit how you spend your time in a casino. And then stick most of your activity in that one casino. </p>

<p>This looks like an ok article on it. Almost directly quotes me in the opening bit heh. Bear in mind, blogs like this could easily be paid for by casino interests themselves. As in all things, do your own research and verify.</p>

<p>Is it possible they use outside data too? Like they may not know anything about a random guy who comes in but the guy who comes in every week spending a decent amount of money could have some useful info on him from other companies (like seeing if he does online poker games, web history, etc).</p>

<p>It seems like casinos are extremely calculated at every level they can control, does this mean making money in a casino (not just coming out ahead once but consistently making money/losing the casino money) won&#39;t happen? </p>

<p>This is a pretty shitty question but can you share anything interesting about penny slots? I&#39;m not really interested in casinos but I always liked the idea of penny slots the most because it has the psychological aspect of feeling like you&#39;re not spending anything which I assume would result in making a decent amount of money (as decent as you can get with the lowest denomination of currency). </p>

<p>As far as penny slots, I&#39;m sure they have a strategy for making money, but I don&#39;t know much about them.</p>

<p>Professional gamblers exist. They make money. But they are extremely disciplined people. There is always a chance to win by law, but I promise you there is in depth statistical analysis of every potential, and they have been manipulated to assure the house can always build more casinos.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The reason they switched to shuffling after each hand is to eliminate the ability to beat the house by counting.   Even if they don&#39;t do this, the shufflers have two alternate modes besides random shuffling.  Every morning at 6am they use them to <strong>sort</strong> the decks to sell in the gift shop.  The other mode gets used when they figure out you are counting - all the 2-5 cards are sorted into the first 75% of the deck, and the picture cards towards the end.  This makes the standard blackjack counting technique backfire.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Casinos don&#39;t need algorithms to win card games. Hand shuffle or machine shuffle, doesn&#39;t make any difference. This is a common misconception but I can explain why blackjack has the worst odds in the house. It all comes down to the player bust vs the dealer bust. Player always loses when he busts but dealer doesn&#39;t always lose when they bust. player is only one at the table, when he busts the dealer wont get a chance to bust and wins automatically where theoretically he could have busted too but he wins by default. It gets worse the more people you have at the table. Pretend you have 5 people at a table and 4 of those people bust and while the 5th gets a 17. Dealers turn and the dealer busts. Dealer still won 4 out of 5 of those hands. In fact, the longer you play blackjack your odds of losing get exponentially higher. If you get luck in the first 15 minutes, walk away because you will lose.</p>

<p>TLDR; Don&#39; play blackjack.</p>

<p>They actually have it lower than that, at 0.5%.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.caesars.com/casino-gaming-blog/latest-posts/table-games/blackjack-craps-baccarat-game-best-odds"><strong>If you’re willing to put in a little work, blackjack offers the best odds. I’m talking about a .5 percent casino edge, depending on which table you’re sitting at.</strong> (Meaning for every dollar you gamble, you’ll lose only half a penny on average.) <strong>But to get these ultra-good odds, you have to know what you’re doing.</strong> Do you hit 12 against a dealer showing a 2? (Yes.) When do you split 4s? (Only when the dealer’s showing a 5 or a 6). When do you split 8s? (Always.) You’ll need to memorize tiny decisions like these to get top odds.</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.caesars.com/casino-gaming-blog/latest-posts/table-games/blackjack-craps-baccarat-game-best-odds">Or you can print out a cheat sheet and bring it to the table with you. 100 percent legal. The casinos won’t give you any slack for it. Now, some of the other players might poke fun at you…but you’ll get the last laugh once you’ve got five towering stacks of “quarters” ($25 chips) sitting in front of you. <strong>If you Google “Blackjack Basic Strategy,” you’ll find all sorts of websites with printable cheat sheets.</strong></a></p>

<p>Like I said, if you know basic strategy (always making the correct decision) then blackjack can have the best odds of any game in the casino. </p>

<p>The problem is, most people do not understand basic strategy. Which is what casinos rely ont</p>

<p>&quot;According to my blackjack appendix 4, the probability of an overall win in blackjack is 42.22%, a tie is 8.48%, and a loss is 49.10%. I&#39;m going to assume you wish to ignore ties for purposes of the streak. In that case, the probability of a win, given a resolved bet, is 46.36%&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dealer has a fixed set of rules for when they must hit, and can never double or split.  Player can do these things intelligently.   Without counting, doing that properly is almost but not quite break even.  With counting, it gives the player a slight edge.  Notable exception: blackjack switch.   In switch, the player theoretically has a slight edge even without counting.   But there are many more hand combinations which are probably too much to memorize what to do when correctly.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dealers memorize only a few combinations and therefore never need to even use any math or complex calculations at all. They don&#39;t need to play intelligently because the game is already rigged in their favor against the player. The reason is because of the player/dealer bust dilemma. I already discussed this in this thead but I will copy/paste it here anyways. Switch has different rules and payouts than other blackjack games so there is still no way to beat the house or even come close to their odds against you</p>

<p>&quot;<em>Casinos don&#39;t need algorithms to win card games. Hand shuffle or machine shuffle, doesn&#39;t make any difference. This is a common misconception but I can explain why blackjack has the worst odds in the house. It all comes down to the player bust vs the dealer bust.</em> <strong>Player always loses when he busts but dealer doesn&#39;t always lose when they bust. player is only one at the table, when he busts the dealer wont get a chance to bust and wins automatically where theoretically he could have busted too but he wins by default. It gets worse the more people you have at the table. Pretend you have 5 people at a table and 4 of those people bust and while the 5th gets a 17. Dealers turn and the dealer busts. Dealer still won 4 out of 5 of those hands.</strong> <em>In fact, the longer you play blackjack your odds of losing get exponentially higher. If you get luck in the first 15 minutes, walk away because you will lose.
TLDR; Don&#39; play blackjack.</em>&quot;</p>

<p>If they actually thought you were counting cards they would&#39;ve sat back and made sure you were doing it, so that they can politely tell you that you&#39;re never allowed to play blackjack at there casino again, or even enter the casino again.</p>

<p>They just pin pointed a coincidence winning streak and he came by to make it clear you were being watched. It happens all the time.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, the gaming industry has a culture. And when that little podunk middle of nowhere Indian Res decides to set up a casino, they don&#39;t just make it up as they go along, they more or less adopt the established practices of the rest of the industry. They also bring in people that have worked in gaming elsewhere to staff their facilities. </p>

<p>So, there isn&#39;t going to be much functional difference between how a vegas resort and a little outfit is going to run their pit, except in scale. And to some degree, the culture is part of the thing the gamblers are looking for too. It is kind of a flavor of the experience that they don&#39;t generally want to mess with. </p>

<p>Making some generalizations here, I am sure there are a few exceptions out there.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s how indian casino gaming works:</p>

<p>Most tribes are relatively poor monetarily, but they have great collateral against future earnings, so they shop around and find a major casino conglomerate to partner with. Once the big dollar Vegas partner is in place, the banks are more than happy to front the money through loans to build casinos and hotels.</p>

<p>The arrangement is usually set up where the tribe will employ a certain amount of people to be trained by seasoned people provided by the casino partner. The casino partner will take the majority of all profit generated for the first 3-5 years as part of the arrangement, and the tribe will get the rest. </p>

<p>At the end of the 3-5 years, the tribe can renegotiate to allow the casino partner to continue overseeing the tribal casino for a split percentage, they can shop around and find another partner, or they can manage the casino themselves.</p>

<p>It&#39;s crazy profitable and it&#39;s not uncommon to have indian casinos that pull in excess of $1,000,000 a day. </p>

<p>They are also profitable in that they stand alone from other casinos, so they don&#39;t have to spend insane amounts of money on shows like Celine Dion to generate traffic. The also avoid having to build crazy fountains, canals, and mega malls to draw traffic. They build hotels that are a loss leader, as they comp rooms just to keep the people at the tables where they can comp them drinks nonstop.</p>

<p>They tend to advertise heavily in Asian markets where they promote tour vacations and mall outings where cheap western name brands are available. Go into any indian casino and you&#39;ll see signage in most of the common Asian languages and a heavy focus on those cultures.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly. Seems smart to me. Both guys I know are twins who went to school for science. But the point is they have the disposable money to play it until they hit the jackpot. Could even reach 10k just to make that extra 5k. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Casinos don&#39;t need algorithms to win card games. Hand shuffle or machine shuffle, doesn&#39;t make any difference. This is a common misconception but I can explain why blackjack has the worst odds in the house. It all comes down to the player bust vs the dealer bust. Player always loses when he busts but dealer doesn&#39;t always lose when they bust. player is only one at the table, when he busts the dealer wont get a chance to bust and wins automatically where theoretically he could have busted too but he wins by default. It gets worse the more people you have at the table. Pretend you have 5 people at a table and 4 of those people bust and while the 5th gets a 17. Dealers turn and the dealer busts. Dealer still won 4 out of 5 of those hands. In fact, the longer you play blackjack your odds of losing get exponentially higher. If you get luck in the first 15 minutes, walk away because you will lose.</p>

<p>TLDR; Don&#39; play blackjack.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So, I asked around work, some of the guys worked with physical machines and stuff, and this was this a great subject. First, no one was sure about the shoe/shuffle button to stack the deck, but as soon as I said it they rolled their eyes and said that makes perfect sense. Then came up with a few ways they could build it. Smart guys.  </p>

<p>Then they all started trading shady stories from working in casinos as slot techs. Shit is not rigged, but it is rigged af.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have worked in gaming almost 20 years, and explained how the math algorithm works, and no one believes me. I can draw simple examples on a napkin, in simple ways, and no one believes it anyways. On top of that, i work with many developers, some who still gamble, knowing what is behind the curtain anyways! I have to believe it wasnt that statement that got you escorted. Might have been location. Like, if you were at the Keno board speaking loudly about how its the worst odds of any game in the casino. Or you were at the Blackjack table, third base, and burning the cards and explaining that if you dont know how to play Blackjack, you can screw over your fellow players by playing stupid. Add alcohol and , well you get the idea. Remember this, when a casino says 96% payback, they mean that for every 1.00 you put in, you have a chance of winning back .96 cents, or less. Its meaningless without context.</p>
