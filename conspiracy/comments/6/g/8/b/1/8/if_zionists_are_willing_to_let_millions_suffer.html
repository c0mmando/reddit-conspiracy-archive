       I'm sure there are people who believe that Hitler was actually a good guy, but I've never encountered them. I think most people on this sub believe that he was a pawn for the elite.

       I agree that Hitler was a stark raving lunatic that was hell bent on genocide and world domination, and that he was probably medicated with a variety of things including methamphetamine. That being said, one of the things Hitler purportedly said was that "someday, the world will see that I was right". Without straying into the anti-zionist realm, or talking about bankers, or Jerusalem it would be easy for racist, stereotypical individuals to assume the poi t of view that I'm hinting at. As I said though, I do not in any way have anything negative to say about any religion or sect of people. My belief is that no matter the Creed or color, there are good men and there are bad. Essentially we are all the same, or better yet, we all have the ability to change, and therefore become the same..

       I think if we were all able to see an unfiltered view of history, we would probably conclude that there haven't been any good guys, in positions of power for a very long time. The hard truth is that we are all flawed. And the harder truth is that we are all responsible for our current situation. That being said, I think you're right. I think at the core of the matter, we are all the same, and that our refusal to recognize this is what leads to all of our problems.

       It would really depend on what those differences are. My personal belief is that we are all of the same spirit. Meaning that our souls all come from the same place, and that the differences we perceive in the relative universe are all illusions. That is my belief though, and not something that I can prove. No matter what differences we may exhibit, however, we still have to share this planet with one another. So we would do well to find common ground with one another.

       That's why Jessie Owens had a framed picture of Hitler and spoke fondly of Germany.  What about all the Muslims and Africans that were in the Nazi army?  The only (((white))) supremacist's there are, are the Israeli's.  Ask the Palestinians.

       There are many lies told about Hitler.  I don't believe he was a good guy, but I don't believe he wanted to genocide anyone.  It's honestly a ridiculous notion once you've dug enough into it.  The holocaust is also one of the most exaggerated and in many cases outright fabricated event in human history.  It's kind of weird when you realize the people responsible for turning him or at least the memory of him into the worst cartoon monster in history are now the people running the world.

       Hitler literally preached some of the things that a lot of people are preaching on this subreddit today. That Jews run the world and that that is wrong and that they should not be in charge of everyone. No order was ever commissioned to "kill all Jews" and with that, there is also no written order to kill all Jews either. Hitler wanted to extradite them, which is also messed up, but he didn't want them all dead.

       They go to show that ,yes the Jews suffered and there was much pain and death in the concentration camps, but they were not death camps. Many of the Jews died from malnutrition and lack of medicine due to American bombing of German supply lines in and out of the so called "death camps".

       Like I said I'm not arguing that Jews didn't get killed or suffer in concentration camps. One of the main focuses of that video is that there was never homicidal gas chambers and that the 6 million figure is a lie, both of which ,after watching that video, made me believe is true.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also a lot of those videos didn't get released or even filmed (mass graves) until AFTER the camps were liberated. There is no way to tell a Jewish person being killed versus another prisoner of different origin.
      </p>
      <p>
       Take the time to watch that video when you get the chance. It is very well done and shows sources and facts that prove that there was an agenda to make it look like a lot more people suffered than actually did.
      </p>
      <p>
       I will again say that I don't deny the holocausts existence, but I don't think it happened the way we are told.

       Of course I studied it in high school and remember doing a large report on it, but interestingly enough, the day before I first viewed the video above, I watched the documentary series on Netflix called Auswitz. Looking back on it though it is almost certainly a means of propaganda, although it is very very well done and very informative about pre WWII Germany and early years of Hitler.

       Yes the BBC one, but the holocaust has interested me for years. I can't specifically tell you the reports I have read up on over the years, but I am 23 and first started studying the holocaust in high school. The fact that I watched one video and it completely changed my outlook and led to more research showing more lies and deception, it almost felt like a slap in the face. It was a hard pill to swallow.
      </p>
      <p>
       The video will explain how many different film crews made the decision to leave out windows from "gas chambers" and to switch to different sections of a building to show that they were gas chambers. The deception has been there since day one.

       History is biased.
      </p>
      <p>
       When Hitler commanded an army that killed a lot of people, it's called genocide, but when the Bolsheviks in Russia killed millions of people it's not called genocide, in fact it is never talked about, every race has oppressed other races, every race have been slaves at one point of time or another.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hitler was not a good man, but he wanted the best for Germany, he rebuilt Germany and kicked the Jews out, the same Jews that today rule Germany, U.K., U.S., etc. If Hitler was alive he would hang himself seeing what Germany has turn into.
