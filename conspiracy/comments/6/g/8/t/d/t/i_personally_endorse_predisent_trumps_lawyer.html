       Presidential immunity from criminal prosecution and lawsuits. Clinton was undergoing impeachment, for example. That is the only situation in which a president can be "on trial", as it were.

       I don't remember. In fact I don't even know how they caught the blowjob. I think it was happening multiple times and someone gave Monica a recording device or they made her call Clinton to get tapes.

      <p>
       Either way he was in deep shit, I would think with his wife. But suddenly you can't govern while getting blowjobs. It's apparently impossible.

       No. Comey's testimony, the date of the tweet (May 12th) and the date of the "leak of content from the memo" (May 11th) is enough to prove perjury.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since it was intended to distort the entire view of events (if Comey leaked before the tweet, his whole story of retaliation is a lie), then perjury is quite assured without any testimony from Trump.

       How? I don't think that matches up. Comey was fired May 9th. A date a know well because I got banned from facebook that day for a month. I know. I'm a conversational terrorist. Which reminds me... I get my facebook back tonight.

       It's simple. Comey said he leaked the email in response to the tweet, but the "content of the memos" was released the day before the tweet.
      </p>

       It's like saying that Trump through the first blow, but the record shows that Comey threw the first punch.

       I guess it really depends on which memo is in question. Supposedly there are more of them. Which is why I personally endorse Trump's lawyer filing a lawsuit and putting Trump under oath.
      </p>
      <p>
       AFAIK, he also said he released more information to get a special counsel as he realized that there may be corroborating evidence for their conversations. I would love to see Trump questioned about tapes.

       Not really. Comey said the "contents of the memo". He never released the memo themselves. And the contents were released on May 11th. Nothing to do with tapes or anything. Merely, he struck first and it is provable that he lied about it.

       I guess we'd have to look at past cases of perjury. On whether or not Comey had intent to deceive or was just mistaken. He has multiple memos each with their own. This could be refering to Flynn or loyalty oaths.

       The "content of the memos".
      </p>
      <p>
       The info was contained in the memo and was from a 1-on-1 meeting and could therefore only come from Comey.
      </p>
      <p>
       And it came before the tweet, not in response.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump's tweet was a response.
      </p>
      <p>
       This proves that Comey is intentionally distorting the whole chain of events to put Trump in a bad light.

      <p>
       Comey had several other fuck-ups, but this is the clearest cut form of perjury that you can have.

       Only two witnesses in the meeting, the meeting is documented in the memos, the contents leaked on a clearly verifiable day, the tweet with a clear date and a lie about them to distort the case from Comey that is provable without any testimony from anyone.

        JAMES COMEY, FORMER FBI DIRECTOR: The president tweeted on Friday, after I got fired, that I better hope there's not tapes. I woke up in the middle of night on Monday night because it didn't dawn on me originally that there might be corroboration for a conversation, there might be a tape. And my judgment was, I needed to get that out into the public square and so
        <strong>
         I asked a friend of mine to share the content of the memo with a reporter
        </strong>
        . I didn't do it myself for a variety of reasons, but I asked him to because I thought that might prompt the appointment of a special counsel. And so I asked a close friend of mine to do it.

        Mr. Comey described details of his refusal to pledge his loyalty to Mr. Trump to several people close to him on the condition that they not discuss it publicly while he was F.B.I. director. But now that Mr. Comey has been fired, they felt free to discuss it on the condition of anonymity.

      <p>
       So, Comey has told his friends about the dinner in the green room and they tell the NYT, without mention of memos, the account of the dinner is identical to the memos (because Comey is a smart man) but their existence was not public.

         according to a memo Mr. Comey wrote shortly after the meeting.

      <p>
       Now, after Trump has tweeted about tapes Comey shows his hand and reveals the memos exist. In effect calling Trump's bluff about tapes.
      </p>
      <p>
       These two leaks are based on the memos but the nuance of the timing is important, no memos were disclosed before May 16th.

       If he was referring to the leak the previous day, why does he phrase it "before he starts leaking"?
      </p>
      <p>
       Comey went public with the memos existence because Trump attempted to threaten him with "tapes".
      </p>

       And lordy, I hope there are tapes.

       This is referred to s English grammar.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's called the implicative conditional and is used for things that should always be done.

       I'm an English teacher, and I'm off duty, so no more grammar lessons for now.

       No, the meeting was one-on-one. That it showed up in the NYTs means it can have only gotten out through Comey. There is no question. You tell one friend you like a guy (I'm assuming your gender) and the whole class starts talking about it:

       You better hope that there are none of your secrets I have before you start telling mine!

       Lol. Why? If there are, then they are in Trump's possession and he doesn't need them to convict Comey of perjury.

       No one said him telling his friend to leak it is a crime.

      <p>
       What is the crime, is lying about it under oath to mislead official proceedings, which is called perjury, which is the title of this thread.

       Now that you know that we are talking about perjury, and that he did do it, certainly you will thank me for putting you on the right path.

       No, the NYT story is a recounting of sources "close to" Comey. It could be the Columbia professor he referred to as leaking the memo or someone else.
      </p>

       The NYT story on the 11th makes no mention of memos, it's a standard "sources say" story.

       Ok, so the "friend of Comey's" who released the "content of the memo" to the reporter happen before May 12th?
      </p>
      <p>
       When Trump wrote the tweet after seeing Comey claim something was said in a one-on-one conversation that was leaked to the reporter from the "content of the memo" would Trump be lying or would Comey when he said "the content of the memo" was released because of Trump's tweet?
      </p>

       Fitting username, BTW.
      </p>
      <p>
       These are rhetorical questions. You are adding nothing and are not even discussing what Comey said. In discussing the possibility of perjury under oath, I think we should stick to what Comey testified to under oath and then see if the facts match.
      </p>

       You seem to want to do something else, so enjoy doing that.

       Jed Shugerman, Professor of Law, Fordham University:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "Finally, Kasowitz condemns Comey for 'leaks.' A leak is not any conversation. It specifically means the release of secret or classified information. 1) None of this material was classified, as Comey carefully and clearly explained. Kasowitz was not paying attention and/or does not understand the meaning of the word "leak." 2) Comey is a private citizen, and he has no duty to conceal nonclassified conversation now. He also was sharing the information with a private citizen. 3) So Kasowitz's letter is really an attack on private free speech by stretching the word leak to cover any conversation by a former government official about nonclassified information and events."

       None of that addresses the fact that Comey lied about the reason and timing of the leak. He made it seem that it was in retaliation to a Trump tweet, but it predated the tweet.
      </p>
      <p>
       He is ignoring the count of perjury and trying to deflect to non-sequiturs. Perjury doesn't require the info be classified. Doesn't matter if he was a private citizen, he was under oath. No one mention Kasowitz letter.
      </p>
      <p>
       Perjury. He committed it. In court they will not be bringing up things Comey didn't do, so your professor will not be of much use.

       Comey testified that he leaked the memos in response to Trump's tweet.  The tweet Comey referenced happened after the times had already published the memo.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now there are a number of possibilities here.
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         Comey actually reacted to a different tweet when he leaked, and upon later reflection thought it would look better to blame a juicer tweet, but it fucked up the timeline and he didn't notice.

       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The NYT already had the memos but we're waiting on instructions to publish, thus the leak appears to get ahead of the tweet.

       Yeah I see what your talking about now. I was just writing that it would be a question of which memo we are talking about. Which is why I want Comey officially charged so we can put Trump under oath about these conversations.

        <strong>
         The president tweeted on Friday, after I got fired, that I better hope there's not tapes.
        </strong>
        I woke up in the middle of night on Monday night because it didn't dawn on me originally that there might be corroboration for a conversation, there might be a tape. And my judgment was, I needed to get that out into the public square and so I asked a friend of mine to share the content of the memo with a reporter. I didn't do it myself for a variety of reasons, but I asked him to because I thought that might prompt the appointment of a special counsel. And so I asked a close friend of mine to do it.

       The timeline thing with the leak being blamed on a tweet that happened after the leak, well it's pretty obvious there is some spinning going on here.

       Anyone who has kids catches these little inconsistencies all the time, that's​ how you know your kid is blowing hot air up your ass when their story has more details it becomes easier for them to accidentally betray their story.  If one part of the story is bullshit then the rest of the story should be questioned.

       One of my favorite things to do with my kids is to accuse them of things I KNOW they didn't do and watch their natural reactions, facial expressions, body language, and the rhythm and cadence of their voices as they plead their innocence. All the while I just give them the questioning "Larry David" stare. I don't let it go on TOO long, and then I tell them I KNOW they didn't do it and was just messing with them like it was a joke...
      </p>
      <p>
       I then use those examples to compare with the times where I actually suspect them of something and those reactions. My oldest kid asks me sometimes how I always know when they are lying, but I only ever tell her "You are transparent to me, dear. I can read your mind!"

       That's what Comey said. That was what he said under oath. But it was a lie. Under oath and hence perjury.

       This is referred to s English grammar.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's called the implicative conditional and is used for things that should always be done.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm an English teacher, and I'm off duty, so no more grammar lessons for now.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Comey went public with the memos existence because Trump attempted to threaten him with "tapes".
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       No, the meeting was one-on-one. That it showed up in the NYTs means it can have only gotten out through Comey. There is no question. You tell one friend you like a guy (I'm assuming your gender) and the whole class starts talking about it:
      </p>
      <p>
       You better hope that there are none of your secrets I have before you start telling mine!
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        And lordy, I hope there are tapes.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Lol. Why? If there are, then they are in Trump's possession and he doesn't need them to convict Comey of perjury.

       No, the "actual memo" has never been leaked, according to Comey.

       The "content of the memo" was leaked by his friend according to Comey.

      <p>
       If the memo were leaked, he wouldn't have been asked for a copy. He was and apparently doesn't have one. Because, you know...
