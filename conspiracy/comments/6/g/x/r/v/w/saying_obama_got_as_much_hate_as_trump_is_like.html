    <div class="md"><p>Yep, main stream media willfully ignored a lot of of Obama&#39;s actions. Trump on the other hand has had a concerted and unanimous effort from the MSM to discredit him (with most of the crap coming from &quot;unnamed sources&quot;) for almost a year now.</p>

<p>I could go on... a lot on  his failure. You dont think its weird he plays golf literally every weekend? On your dime? Whats your opinion on this? Especially after Trump ran on the premise he wouldnt play golf like Obama did, and he called out Obama for playing golf. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Suggesting that someone needs a TV to understand current events on a conspiracy forum is the height of stupidity. All of the MSM is corporate owned and they&#39;ll collaborate to spread the right message. Everyone, including all major TV news channels and the NYT, worked to push us into the Iraq War.</p>

<p>You can claim that everyone&#39;s just out to get Trump, but to a lot of people it looks like Trump is a massive failure and the media is sometimes too soft on him, like calling him &quot;presidential&quot; because he read a speech off a TelePrompTer.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll spell it out for you. </p>

<p>Trump did something stupid. Attacking Hillary doesn&#39;t change the fact that Trump did something stupid. In fact, it just means that you&#39;re saying he&#39;s equal to the person you hate. </p>

<p>Also, Trump gets criticized because he&#39;s been a horrendous president so far. He hasn&#39;t passed any legislation, his major executive order is unconstitutional as declared by several courts, he got destroyed on his first budget deal, he admitted he fired Comey because he was investigating Russia, he said he wouldn&#39;t golf and he has more than Obama, his approval rating is 36%, the CBO said his healthcare plan will kick 23 million off of insurance, etc. </p>

<p>Hell, he openly lies so much (votes, electoral college win amount, crowd sizes, Comey firing, his own accomplishments, etc) that in order to cover it you have to add in the real facts which makes it &quot;negative&quot;. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It occurred to me that it&#39;s largely a matter of perspective.  They all do really terrible things and hide it behind a veneer of credibility and altruism when the reality is anything but.  Obama had a better propaganda machine behind him and the protection of both the establishment and the mainstream media to cover up all of his worst abuses of power, whereas they have no problem exposing everything Trump does because he&#39;s not one of them.  Doesn&#39;t make him worse.  You&#39;re talking about the actions of a guy after only 6 months vs. Presidents who had four to eight <em>years</em> to implement their agendas, but Trump&#39;s the worst?  I think fucking not.</p>

<p>Are you serious?  The pictures were taken at the exact same time of day.  There were more people at the women&#39;s match the following weekend than at his inauguration. </p>

<p>He should have just shut the fuck up about it and moved on. The problem is that he simply can&#39;t let any perceived slight go without retaliation. </p>

<p>Annoyed and having it be an issue for so long are two different things. Set the record straight and move on, this one is all hubris. Trump cant let it go because of his ego where a normal human would point out its bullshit then get to work. </p>

<p>He put on a voice and used mimicked movements stereotypical of people with physical and mental disabilities. Doing that for many people isn&#39;t an excuse.</p>

<p>&quot;They can&#39;t say no&quot;. He&#39;s bragging that he doesn&#39;t need consent because he&#39;s too powerful.</p>

<p>Very popular video went around showing the crowd gather and dissipate. The popular photo used as a comparison was taken at peak, and pretty much the same angle as 2008.</p>

<p>Did you read the article? He REPORTEDLY apologised VIA PHONE CALL to a specific person. He did not apologize publicly, not that I&#39;m insinuating he should have. I don&#39;t care, I thought it was a bit funny to be honest, I&#39;d tell the same sort of joke among my own friends, why would it bother me to hear the President tell such a joke? The political correctness is absolutely absurd, then again the double standard is equally absurd when the standard is applied to a certain President because he doesn&#39;t have the right letter in front of his name.</p>

<p>I mean, <a href="https://youtu.be/EpGH02DtIws">he said he had been to 57 states</a>? If that doesn&#39;t qualify as a &quot;gaffe,&quot; I&#39;m not sure what would, man. Everyone makes mistakes when they&#39;re in the spotlight making public statements 6 or 7 days of the week. Why is Obama supposedly above reproach? I guess he was good on the campaign trail, but m8, he&#39;s a human being who makes the same mistakes anyone would. He&#39;s more &quot;refined&quot; than Trump as a politician, but so what?</p>

<p>Wow, dude. This is exactly the hypocrisy that&#39;s sickening. The &quot;pussy grabbing&quot; comment was secretly taped in a private conversation among two men, not an on-record statement in a public forum. If the media cared to dig as hard into Obama&#39;s private life, don&#39;t you think they&#39;d find something equally as unflattering, or maybe you think he shits golden eggs that smell of rose petals. It&#39;s not that I support everything Trump does and says, but I can recognize where there&#39;s a double standard that holds him to a much higher degree of scrutiny, and that frankly disgusts me.</p>

<p>Was I happy about Glenn Beck showing Obama wearing a swastika arm band every other night of the week? No, it was just as asinine and absurd as it is now. The difference you have is Glenn Beck getting fired from Fox News, and the rest of the media that is basically engaging in the same rhetoric now couldn&#39;t be flying higher. Hypocrisy at its finest.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Beck didn&#39;t get fired. He left at the peak of his ratings to start The Blaze and make $40,000,000 a year. But, props to Beck for coming out later and admitting how wrong he was. His ratings showed that people wanted his nonsense though, and he was happy to provide it to them for many years.</p>

<p>Your posting history outs you as quite the snowfake. You spent an insane amount of time on The_Donald complaining about unfair media, while praising people like Hannity, O&#39;Keefe, and Alex Jones.</p>

<p>If you were intelligent or competent, you would agree that the media puts ridiculous spin on everything Trump says or does, but also point out that its exactly like what Beck was doing... generating the headlines people want to read. You can also point out that what Trump does IS ridiculous and DOES need to be criticized, and legitimate news outlets do do that, it just doesn&#39;t get the same readership as &#39;Trump&#39;s tiny hands could slip and set off a nuclear missile&#39;. He is not a competent leader and his lack of understanding and seeming unwillingness/inability to learn is incredibly dangerous, but to degenerate into hyperbole and rabid hot takes is literally exactly what the right did with Obama. </p>

<p>Go check his post history. His hypocrisy is the point. He is crying about media coverage of Trump being too negative, but he was praising and sharing similar negative coverage of Obama. He, like so many other people, like to attack others, but cry when they are on the receiving end of the same thing. </p>

<p>You&#39;re correct, it is hypocrisy, but these trump supporters feel as though the mainstream culture is vilifying Trump (most major news networks, talkshow hosts, pretty much anyone in hollywood, etc.) whereas it was just Fox news and Alex Jones types shitting on Obama while everyone else praised him. Its a symptom of the urban-rural divide, and its not going to get any better. Unfortunately most people respond emotionally to their politics being questioned, so logical and measured debate is almost impossible. IMO its still worth forming arguments rather than devolving into namecalling.</p>

<p>In response, underlining that the link between himself and Mr Sater was merely a “very simple licensing deal”, he said: “Maybe you’re thick but when you have a signed contract, you can’t in this country just break it… Sometimes we’ll sign a deal and the partner isn’t as good as we’d like but that does happen, and by the way, I hate to do this but I do have that big group of people waiting so I have leave…”</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hi, thanks for your reply. If you don&#39;t mind, I&#39;d like to reply, and do my best to be polite and respectful, and you&#39;re welcome to write back, but if you don&#39;t want to, that&#39;s okay too of course. I&#39;m just quoting below to separate points:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>negative, biased, and outright false media coverage</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I can see negative, I can see biased, sure, but I&#39;m interested in your opinion, what <em>false</em> has been said, do you think?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>engineered to discredit him</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is something I read that I don&#39;t know if I understand, what makes you think this? He already won the election, what would be the point of discrediting at this point, do you think? Impeachment? I don&#39;t like him, and even I don&#39;t particularity want that. Impeachment, in my opinion, at any time, would be bad for the country, makes us look weak, etc. Is that it, or do you think there is another agenda?</p>

<p>I think I know what you&#39;re talking about with &quot;MSM punch&quot; - I know some people myself who might fit in that category, but personally I try to read different sources, including ones I dislike, and opinions I happen to disagree with, to try to understand and get different points of view.</p>

<p>Not sure why you&#39;re assuming I have a big ego - my comment wasn&#39;t focused on myself, but that&#39;s okay. </p>

<p>If you don&#39;t mind me asking, do you assume that <em>everyone</em> who dislikes Trump has been duped? </p>

<ul>
<li>also, duped in what way, do you mean? (I mean, I&#39;ve disliked him for years, a bit based on the persona he himself portrayed on his own shows, so it&#39;s not a new thing). And I don&#39;t like the things he himself says in his tweets, so I don&#39;t know what you mean by duped. </li>
</ul>

<p>So, what, in your opinion, exactly is going around that is actually <strong>false</strong>? I keep hearing that but not exactly what it&#39;s about. Care to enlighten this duped fool over here? :)</p>

<p>If you&#39;d like to share, I&#39;ll read it and won&#39;t argue or anything, I just want to know, and get tired of &quot;echo chambers&quot; myself so would love to have an exchange of ideas with someone different from me. I ask people but don&#39;t ever really get any replies, unfortunately. So I do try to do my own research, but like you said, a lot of sources are biased, so it can be a challenge to get an honest portrayal of both sides of many issues.</p>

<p>Yes there is. I&#39;ll give credit to the administration for trying on many issues, but he cannot gain a consensus among his own party. Obama struggled with the same thing early in his first term. Many moderate Democrats weren&#39;t on board with some of the policy the White House and more left-leaning Democrats were pushing. This is an even larger problem with the GOP because there is an even greater gap between the Trump wing of the party and the moderate Republicans. </p>

<p>Because he golfs every weekend. If he cared about getting a consensus he would but he isnt and the only thing stopping him is himself. </p>

<p>There is no consensus to be had. They elected too many Congressmen who only know how to be in the opposition as part of the 2010 GOP wave. There are far too many inexperienced Republicans who only know how to say no.</p>

<p>These are the people who insisted the ACA/Obamacare was the worst thing ever and we needed a full repeal immediately. It turned out that many people really appreciated SOME of the provisions within the law, and taking those benefits away from people will make them worse off. So, the bulk of the party is trying to repeal/replace, while a powerful minority will only accept repeal without any replacement. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>I agree. It is obvious that being President is much harder than he ever imagined (his own words). He seems willing to try when things are easy, but immediately gives up once any sort of effort or compromise is required. </p>

<p>But, I don&#39;t think him staying in DC over being on the golf course every weekend would have much of an impact. Policy leadership has already been shifted away from the White House to Congressional leadership (McConnell and Ryan) and they have a much better shot at getting things done with Trump not involved. </p>

<p>I honestly like that you are so into Trump you wont even acknowledge him golfing more than any other president. As for the GOP wave thats a very weak argument, its his party. He needs to work with the speaker to get everyone cohesive, these are all easily fixes but he hasnt been bothered to do so yet. </p>

<p>tldr; he needs to start leading not complaining. </p>

<p>I&#39;m the furthest thing from a Trump supporter. I don&#39;t mind him golfing because it keeps him from doing further damage to our checks and balances for a few days each week. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s not his party. Much of his incoherent policy goes against the core values of conservatives. He was a Democrat for most of his life anyways, and his anti-trade and heavy handed economic policy are much more aligned with Democrats. It&#39;s been nice to expose all the fake conservatives in the party, but sadly, many GOP voters have shown they didn&#39;t really care about those values either. </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Never going to happen. So far, &quot;working with Congress&quot; has meant Trump demanding people do what he says. They ignore him, he threatens them on Twitter, and then chances of compromise are even less likely. Presidents with 36% approval ratings don&#39;t tend to have much influence over Congress, and every attempt just weakens what little influence he does have. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>He can&#39;t lead. Leadership is not a quality that Trump has. He doesn&#39;t seem to understand leadership is given, not demanded. </p>

You&#39;d take a fairly large loss with taxes during the withdraw, which would probably take years of <em>increasing</em> stock value to recover.

<p>You saying that it is because it&#39;s &quot;Trump&#39;s own words&quot; shows that you either don&#39;t realize that the current travel ban he&#39;s trying to push through is an entirely different (and frankly watered down) version of the actual muslim ban that he talked about during his presidential campaign, or you&#39;re just intentionally trying to mislead. I&#39;m guessing the second one. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>You&#39;re missing several key aspects. </p>

<p>He said it was going to be a Muslim ban. Giuliani then said that Trump asked him how to do a Muslim ban but package it.</p>

<p>So Trump said it was a Muslim ban, I&#39;m taking him at his word. </p>

<p>Either you don&#39;t realize that or you&#39;re just trying to defend Trump at all costs. It&#39;s ok to criticize your government. </p>

<p>If it was a &quot;Muslim Ban&quot;, it would be banning all of the Muslim countries. Just because he calls it something his voters may want to hear, does not mean it is effectively a Muslim ban.

<p>Trump is saying one thing and doing another, like any salesman or showman does. He is basically doing politics with less finesse. Just because of someones publicly perceived personality is not a good reason to judge an executive order on. He can publicly state his intent is one thing, without that actually being his entire stance on the issue. If it&#39;s what his voters want to hear, and if Americans want a President who doesn&#39;t roll over for a 9th-circuit circus court, then of course he will publicly say one thing and in court argue another. </p>

<p>That isn&#39;t a function of the President, it&#39;s a function of Congress. Establishment Republicans are no different than establishment Democrats. Liberals would cry about the &quot;do nothing Congress&quot; under Obama, well guess what, we still have a &quot;do nothing Congress&quot;. Obama got &quot;his&quot; legislation passed because it was all globalist legislation, which is what most of our Congress supports. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s not a &quot;Muslim ban&quot; (I wouldn&#39;t care if it was) and to say so is disingenuous. Is Trump inarticulate in describing it? Sure, but like everything else in American life these days, the people making decisions are corrupt and controlled by a globalist agenda, so of course the activist judges running liberal courts are going to block everything. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>His national security advisor had to resign. His AG had to recuse himself.\</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Neither had to resign. They did so because it was seen as easier to do so and it was thought that doing so would help end this nonsense. Of course, that was a miscalculation and all it did was serve to give red meat to his opposition. Neither Sessions or Flynn will ever be in any trouble for any of this, because they have done nothing wrong, but the optics do look bad to people that only care how things look.</p>

<p>Jesus Christ dude, talk about spin. He didn&#39;t admit any such thing, because he was not under any investigation. Comey stated he wasn&#39;t under investigation in his testimony. Why would Trump fire Comey over Russia if there was no investigation? It&#39;s fucking ridiculous. Comey was fired because Comey is shit. He&#39;s a liar that can&#39;t/won&#39;t produce his &quot;memo&#39;s&quot; or notes. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The FBI director said Trump directed him to drop the investigation and claimed that because Trump lies so often he had to take notes on their conversations.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>False. There was no investigation. Comey said he had to take notes because he felt uncomfortable. He also said that Loretta Lynch directed him to call the Clinton investigation a &quot;matter&quot; and not an investigation. Did he take notes of their further meetings? No, of course not, because Comey is shit and isn&#39;t interested in justice or investigating anything. He&#39;s a partisan hack protecting the Clintons. End of story.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>He&#39;s given ethics wavers at 5 times the rate of Obama and hired his own family to be his key advisors despite his promise to &quot;drain the swamp&quot;.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Are you stupid? His family hasn&#39;t been involved in DC politics. They are not part of &quot;the swamp&quot;. As for the waivers? So what? I don&#39;t begrudge Obama or any President for issuing waivers. If you hire a guy to run say, Health and Human Services and he&#39;s worked for large insurance or medical corporations before, he&#39;s gonna need a waiver. To avoid the waiver would mean hiring someone not involved in that industry. Then we&#39;d get to listen to people like you complain that the appointment of said person &quot;isn&#39;t qualified&quot;, which is exactly what happened with Ben Carson. You are full of shit. The left is full of shit. The progressives, and SJW&#39;s and liberals are all full of shit. You are attacking a President before he&#39;s really even had a chance to do anything with nothing but hot air, innuendo and rumor. No evidence of any wrong doing, no witnesses. Nothing but your righteous indignation that you lost.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>He has already backtracked on his promise to not support health care legislation that drops people as the plan he supported will cause 23 million to lose insurance.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Which is really only allowing people forced to buy insurance by Obama the ability to decide for themselves if they want insurance or not. Free choice in the land of the free and home of the brave - the horror!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>He hasn&#39;t even gotten funds to build his promised wall and his first budget deal he got wrecked by Democrats.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Of course he hasn&#39;t. Congress is full of globalist douche bags that can&#39;t wait to import third worlders. You think because a person has an (R) next to their name they don&#39;t want the illegals here? Get real. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I mean, like it or not his presidency thus far has been a disaster.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>From the perspective of people that hated him before he was ever elected, of course it&#39;s been a disaster. From his supporters perspective, they don&#39;t agree. Sure, they&#39;d like to have seen more done, but they also know what he is up against. IMO, it&#39;s amazing he&#39;s accomplished any of the stuff he has. See that coal mine open up in PA? That&#39;s the kind of shit his supporters really care about. Remember Obama saying &quot;you can open a coal mine, but you&#39;ll go bankrupt&quot;? That&#39;s why he was hated so badly. Who the fuck is that little shit to tell the American people he&#39;s going to bankrupt them? That shit is worse than anything Trump has said or done. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>People here in this sub keep trying to act as if Obama and Trump were equal in their accomplishments and their demeanor but they&#39;re not.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You are right, they are not equals. Obama accomplished nothing in life until he became President. Once he was President, he was very accomplished in helping destroy the nation. Trump is erasing his legacy one item at a time. In 100 years, Obama will be remembered for being the first black man elected President and nothing more. Trump on the other hand has been successful in many areas before he ever ran for office. Obama won in &#39;08 with the media sucking his dick the whole way. Trump did it with his party, the left, the media, the deep state and most the rest of the world against him. You are right, Obama and Trump aren&#39;t equals. Obama isn&#39;t 1/10th the man Trump is. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Trump gets more negative press because so far his presidency has been overwhelmingly more negative than positive.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Trump gets more negative press because he&#39;s not a gay, trans, black communist working to hand the nation over to globalists that care nothing for the American people. </p>

<p>Everyone predicted she&#39;d be President. She isn&#39;t. </p>

<blockquote>
<ol>

<p>The polls are rigged garbage. They are irrelevant. The polls had Clinton winning Michigan in the primaries. She lost Michigan to Bernie. The polls suck and you are stupid to listen to them. </p>

<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Trump has been his own worst enemy, making promises that he can&#39;t keep and putting false deadlines on legislation for no reason.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>

<p>So? What&#39;s the point. All politicians make promises they can&#39;t keep. They make them to inspire hope in their electorate. The difference is that Trump is actually fighting for the people that elected him. Obama and others just lie and never try to actually keep their promises. Remember &quot;if you like your plan you can keep it, if you like your doctor you can keep him&quot;. They never even tried to accomplish that shit. </p>

<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Trump&#39;s scandals have caused congress to drag to a standstill. For example, rather than working on legislation the Senate has to work on confirming a new FBI director.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>

<p>Congress hasn&#39;t done shit in years except pass globalist legislation. The idea that because of Trump they just now stopped doing anything is ridiculous. The fact that he has Republican majorities and they investigating, what amounts to nothing, only reinforces my point that Congress is full of globalists that don&#39;t care about the people. </p>

<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Trump has said that he&#39;s passed legislation, he hasn&#39;t. Other presidents in this time frame have passed several major pieces of legislation. Trump is lying when he says he&#39;s done more than other presidents.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>

<p>He has passed legislation. Has he passed as much as past President&#39;s? No. Why? Because his legislation is not part of the globalist agenda. Since previous administrations and Congress&#39;s have passed nothing but crap legislation to help destroy the nation, by doing nothing (as you say) Trump has arguably done more for the country than the other guys by simply not fucking it up more. </p>

<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Trump himself called it a Muslim Ban. So take your outrage up with him.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>

<p>He called it a Muslim ban before it ever existed and as I said, I wouldn&#39;t care if it was. Calling something one thing doesn&#39;t make it so. Trump calling it a Muslim ban, doesn&#39;t make it a Muslim ban. The only thing that could make it a Muslim ban would be if it said &quot;no Muslims from any nation are allowed entry&quot;. Surprise, that isn&#39;t what it says. </p>

<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Trump asked Giuliani how to implement a Muslim Ban.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>

<p>It doesn&#39;t matter. He can say anything. He can ask anyone anything. What matters is what the language of the text says. It doesn&#39;t say &quot;ban all the Muslims&quot;. It does say &quot;ban these dangerous people from these specific countries, which are very dangerous places&quot;. It excludes 1.3 billion Muslims, which is the vast majority.</p>

<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>The 4th court also denied the order. They aren&#39;t liberal like the 9th.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>

<p>So says you. All the courts in this country are full of liberal idiots. </p>

<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Flynn resigned, Trump then tried to claim he didn&#39;t resign but was fired even though Flynn already had a resignation letter.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>

<p>So? Because they did, doesn&#39;t mean they <em>had</em> to. They made a political choice to do so. It was a mistake to do so.</p>

<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Flynn lied about his contacts with Russia and Turkey. Trump and Pence then lied about not knowing about it.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>

<p>Not true, but I won&#39;t bother arguing this point with you.</p>

<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Sessions had to recuse himself because of lying about conversations with the Russians. If he didn&#39;t do anything wrong then he wouldn&#39;t have had to recuse himself.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>

<p>No, that isn&#39;t why someone recuse themselves. They recuse themselves precisely so no one can say there is any impropriety. Their decision to recuse was a calculated decision. They miscalculated thinking it would shut the left up a bit, but the left never shuts the fuck up, which was their miscalculation.</p>

<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>There is an investigation into Russian collusion. Trump and Comey have both said so.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>

<p>But Trump is not under investigation, which is what the NYT and all the other liberal assholes on Reddit and the rest of the internet have been saying. </p>

<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Comey said he had to take notes because Trump is a habitual liar.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>

<p>And Comey won&#39;t produce his notes and leaked them in order to get a special prosecutor selected AFTER he was fired. Comey is the liar. </p>

<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Nepotism is clearly part of the problem in Washington.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>

<p>No. A much bigger problem is allowing all these people that don&#39;t have kids places in our government or regulating bodies. That&#39;s a far bigger problem than whatever problems you think are associated with nepotism. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Trump said no one would lose insurance. Thus he lied.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you never wanted insurance to begin with and he&#39;s not forcing you to purchase it any longer and that is why you &quot;lose&quot; your insurance, then you didn&#39;t &quot;lose&quot; anything. Only a moron would claim a loss for something they never wanted to begin with. It&#39;s a moot point anyway because, and I am sure you will agree, the healthcare bill isn&#39;t going to pass anyway. Which means we&#39;ll all get to sit back and watch Obamacare implode. I personally can&#39;t wait!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Trump has three branches of government and has accomplished very little. Those are the facts.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, and the reasons I described as to why little has been done are also facts. I&#39;d rather have them do nothing than fuck up more shit than they already have. That is improvement. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Which one came from a lower class background, got himself into Ivy league schools, graduated with honors and as the first black editor of the Harvard Review?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Produce Obama&#39;s school records or stfu. What you are spouting is pure myth and legend. There is no evidence to substantiate any of that. No record. No articles from his days at Harvard Review. Nothing but books that Bill Ayers wrote confirms this crappy story.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Which one was given millions of dollars to start a business by his rich father? Credit he has done well for himself.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He was given a million dollars and turned it into billions. It&#39;s the equivalent of me or you becoming millionaires. He did it by building real stuff. Obama got where he is through scams and lies.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Both have accomplishments. Don&#39;t pretend like Obama did nothing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He never did and never will accomplish shit beyond lying his ass off to get elected. I guess if you count giving $770,000 speeches to elites, while riding on private jets and telling the rest of the world to reduce it&#39;s carbon footprint, you could say he&#39;s accomplished something. The Iran deal will burn. Obamacare will collapse. Obama has no accomplishments and the ones he claims will be erased by his betters or will come undone due to the stupidity of their creator. </p>

<p>Trump does both. There&#39;s nepotism and granting ethics wavers and hiring lobbyists at a level that far surpasses Obama.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t disagree, but the reasons he hasn&#39;t are true and valid as well. I didn&#39;t vote for Obama. I thought he was a phony fuck from day one. But you know what? I wanted him to do well. I wanted him to succeed. I wanted him to do the things he said he was going do to in &#39;07 and &#39;08. If the establishment had aligned against him and prevented him from perusing the agenda he outlined in &#39;07 and &#39;08 the way they have Trump, I&#39;d have been fucking pissed about it.

<blockquote>
<p>He hasn&#39;t passed any major legislation. Despite his repeated promises to have done so within literally a single day.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So you&#39;re admitting that&#39;s Trumps words. Good.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sure. He said it on twitter (I think) and at campaign rallies. What he said is irrelevant though. What matters is what is written in the actual bill or proposal. There is no logic to support the idea that what was written is a Muslim ban.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>That&#39;s not true. Please read the actual reports from the Appeals Courts. Intent matters.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Intent has to be followed through with action. If his intent was to ban Muslims, the proposal would have been a failure because it doesn&#39;t attempt to ban Muslims. The courts are full of shit, because they are only evaluating intent without evaluating weather or not the actual proposal attempts to achieve the expressed intent on twitter and the campaign trail. It&#39;s just more crap from activist judges. </p>

<p>Your right, he&#39;s only been caught covering up the lies of the Clintons.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Which was done because he had been caught lying under oath about his connections meaning there was evidence to believe there was impropriety.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No. You are removing all context from the questions he was asked. The meeting he was asked about had nothing to do with the meetings he actually had. The meetings he had are innocuous and commonplace. Because they are such, he wasn&#39;t even considering those when he responded. Because there is a which hunt going on, the media has pointed to those meetings as if they are proof of something. The truth is that similar such meetings take place all the time by people on both sides.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Trump does both. There&#39;s nepotism and granting ethics wavers and hiring lobbyists at a level that far surpasses Obama.
Also, interesting you don&#39;t think nepotism is a problem.
TIL that draining the swamp means hiring your own relatives, hiring big bankers, dodging ethics laws by using waivers, etc.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Show me the people in his administration that are responsible for the mess the country is in now. You are slandering people based on their profession rather than asking weather or not those people were actually ever in charge of anything. Having money or lobbying the government doesn&#39;t automatically make you part of the swamp. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Again, you&#39;re literally arguing against Trump. He said they wouldn&#39;t lose insurance. The CBO score shows that&#39;s false.
And if you actually read any of the report you&#39;d know that the number includes tens of millions who don&#39;t want to lose insurance but won&#39;t be able to afford it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s the same CBO that has gotten everything wrong from Obamacare to our growth rates based on the bailouts and stimulus packages. Quoting the words of liars and fools doesn&#39;t help your argument. Obamacare is failing and all those people you are so worried about are losing their insurance with or without Trump. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>No, those are opinions.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They are facts. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>It&#39;s been corroborated through several sources that Obama graduated magna cum laude from Harvard. None of this is legend.
Produce a record that Trump graduated top of his class from Wharton, as he&#39;s claimed and I&#39;ll produce record of Obama.
Seems like a fair trade.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s not a fair trade at all. Obama&#39;s records are all sealed. You only have his words and the words of his buddies to support his claims, but you also have people that supposedly went to school with him that claim he was never there. No one has ever disputed that Trump went to Wharton. Did he get a &#39;B&#39; instead of an &#39;A&#39;? Sure, possibly so. Did he graduate last instead of first? Maybe so. Is it possible he lied about his academic record, sure. In fact, we have records we can look at that indicate he didn&#39;t do as well as is claimed. The point is this: THE RECORDS EXIST. We can go look at them. You cannot do the same in Obama&#39;s case. It&#39;s apples and hand grenades you are comparing. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>As I said, I give him credit for being successful. You&#39;re the only one pretending that Obama wasn&#39;t successful.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m not pretending anything. Obama was a terrible failure. You are the one pretending he has accomplished something. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>It&#39;s more a statement about your posts. You&#39;re taking defending a billionaire globalist very seriously.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And you are taking defending the biggest loser President the nation ever had very seriously. Trump is not perfect and he hasn&#39;t done what I wanted him to do in many respects. The problem with talking to people like you is that you are so ridiculous in your criticism you can&#39;t have a rational conversation based in reality. Trump is not beyond criticism, but the criticism levied at him (currently) is mostly just innuendo, rumor and lies. TPTB are clearly trying to take down an elected President and people on a CONSPIRACY THEORY subreddit are ignoring it, justifying it and even hoping it happens. Since you can&#39;t possibly know how &quot;serious&quot; I am or am not, let me assure you that if I seem serious it&#39;s only because of this bigger picture. If I thought Obama was being taken down by TPTB I&#39;d defend him to. Hell, I&#39;ve defended Bernie for this exact reason and I believe him to be a crazy person based on his policy prescriptions. I don&#39;t look at it any different than I do Kennedy. TPTB killed him and I wish they hadn&#39;t, not because he was so great (he wasn&#39;t) but because he was elected and the people had their choice stolen from them. The people that got Trump elected have been ignored by both parties for decades. They deserve to have their voices heard and Trump deserves some latitude to try and deliver for the people that got him elected. This is how I feel about literally every president ever.</p>

<p>The polls, pollsters and media spent more than a year telling us how he couldn&#39;t win. He won. Whatever methodology they are using wasn&#39;t good enough to predict the correct outcome, so it was useless. The polling data they produce saying Trump is at x% is using from the same biased places that couldn&#39;t use predict the correct outcome of a number of recent events. Keep stroking your dick about methodology if you like, but it&#39;s irrelevant to the outcomes in the real world. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>Nothing you say matters until the bill passes, which it won&#39;t, so you are speculating about future events that will never happen. You are shouting into the wind. If/when it ever passes, it will have been reworked six ways from Sunday. Those that want insurance and can pay for it with their own money instead of grubbing after everyone else&#39;s will have it. Those that don&#39;t want it won&#39;t be forced to buy it. The CBO is wrong about every prediction it ever made, so good luck with them.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Trump being to blame for a good amount of the inaction, as I explained before.</p>

<p>You didn&#39;t explain any such thing. Trump is quite active. He can&#39;t force Congress to act and he&#39;s doing all he can to get them to. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>You have literally nothing to support that statement.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yeah I do. His own behavior and statements. It&#39;s highly irregular for an FBI director to say one way or the other who should be prosecuted, but Comey did. He didn&#39;t inform anyone until the other day that Loretta Lynch pressured him to say &quot;matter&quot; instead of &quot;investigation&quot;. He didn&#39;t bother to mention it before because he&#39;s covering up for them. He&#39;s fucking full of shit no matter which way you slice it. If you were a rational person, you&#39;d see that. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Obama legislation helped stop a recession and insured millions. And regardless of how you feel, he still accomplished his agenda.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, he lied about what his agenda was in &#39;07 and &#39;08, then turned around and executed a different agenda. None of his so called accomplishments will last. They will be erased by his betters or fail because they were flawed ideas at conception. He also did not stop a recession. He papered over the financial problems of the nation by printing and spending money. Our financial situation as a nation is far worse now than it was when he took office. The day of reckoning is still coming and it will be far worse because of Barry Soetorro than it ever would have been if no one had done anything in 2008.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Sessions seems to disagree with you seeing as he recused himself.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;ve already addressed this. You are repeating yourself now.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>He was asked if he had contact as part of Trumps team. He said no. Evidence showed yes. End of.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No. He was asked if he had contact as part of Trumps team, which he did not. He did have contact as a Senator sitting on various committees. The latter was used after the question was asked to make him appear to be a liar about the former and stupid people like you fall for that tactic. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>So you&#39;re ok with nepotism and hiring lobbyists and getting them through using ethics wavers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If they were the same people that created this nations problems, of course not. Has Steve Bannon, Steve Mnuchin, Wilbur Ross, Ivanka and Jared Trump etc. been in our government fucking up our country the past 70 years? No, they haven&#39;t been, so no I don&#39;t have a problem with them being there. Just because they have money doesn&#39;t mean they are part of the swamp. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Put up or shut up. Show me Trumps grades or his final ranking. And there&#39;s proof Obama went to those schools, you&#39;re free to look them up.&#39;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You are asking me to defend a point I never made. I&#39;ve never heard Trump claim he graduated in the top of his class. If he made the claim, I wouldn&#39;t be surprised. If he actually graduated top of his class I wouldn&#39;t be surprised. If he embellished how well he did in school I wouldn&#39;t be surprised. I don&#39;t have to put up anything for claims I did not make, unless of course you are disputing whether or not he even went to Wharton. Is that what you are doing? I&#39;ve not heard anyone dispute weather or not he went to Wharton. Obama on the other hand, you can&#39;t prove he ever did anything he said he did and saying &quot;all Obama&#39;s friends say it&#39;s true&quot; isn&#39;t evidence of anything. There is no proof Obama ever did anything because he&#39;s had all his records sealed, so produce his records or stfu already. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Yep, he has amazing accomplishments and managed to do so without having rich parents to finance him. So yes, you&#39;re pretending.

<p>He has no accomplishments. None. Zero. Getting elected isn&#39;t an accomplishment when the media sucks your dick the whole way and you are carrying water for TPTB. Even you could probably manage it under those circumstances. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Yet here you are, defending someone who thus far has been definitively worse in every measure as president.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He could do nothing and be better than his predecessor who did nothing but fuck shit up. Doing nothing is better than doing the wrong thing. By simply occupying the seat he&#39;s already accomplished more good than Hillary of Obama ever will because he keeps them from advancing their globalist agenda. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Keep defending the billionaire globalist who is stocking the government with his own family looking to get even richer. Ignore him sending billions to Saudi Arabia. Ignore him stocking the government with globalist bankers. One day you&#39;ll open your eyes and realize how they&#39;ve duped you.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You wouldn&#39;t know a globalist or a bankster if they stole hour house and gave it to Muslims or illegals. </p>

<p>I may one day wake up and realize I was duped by Trump (if that&#39;s the way it turns out), but you will never realize you&#39;ve been duped by Obama. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Google. It&#39;s your friend. </p>

<p>Manafort resigned because of Russian connections. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes he worked for the Russians, okay maybe something there. Of course he left the Trump team last year.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Flynn resigned because of Russian connections. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Incorrect, Flynn resigned because he lied to the Vice President. As his job as national security adviser, it is his job to talk to ambassadors around the world. 
So maybe a connection there but again he has been out for a long time.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Sessions had to recuse himself because of Russian connections. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sessions recused himself because of law - 28 CFR 45.2 - states that DOJ employees may not &quot;participate in a criminal investigation or prosecution if he has a personal or political relationship with any person or organization substantially involved in the conduct that is the subject of the investigation or prosecution, or who would be directly affected by the outcome&quot;.</p>

<p>Him following the rules is hardly evidence of Russia connection.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Kushner lied about business he had with Russians. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Didn’t Disclose $1 Billion in Loans, Investment Ties to Goldman Sachs and George Soros, so yeah he probably is a Russian spy. But those are Democrat businesses. He is certainly working for the left.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Trump lied about knowing Putin. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Damn that interview is pretty damning. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Trump admitted he fired Comey because of his Russian investigation. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yeah because Comey wouldn&#39;t tell the country that Trump isn&#39;t under investigation.</p>

<p>So there may be some ties to russia but Trump himself doesn&#39;t have any. They closed the investigation into Trump himself last year. Why would they stop investigating him if they weren&#39;t sure he has not ties to Putin?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It occurred to me that it&#39;s largely a matter of perspective.  They all do really terrible things and hide it behind a veneer of credibility and altruism when the reality is anything but.  Obama had a better propaganda machine behind him and the protection of both the establishment and the mainstream media to cover up all of his worst abuses of power, whereas they have no problem exposing everything Trump does because he&#39;s not one of them.  Doesn&#39;t make him worse.  You&#39;re talking about the actions of a guy after only 6 months vs. Presidents who had four to eight <em>years</em> to implement their agendas, but Trump&#39;s the worst?  I think fucking not.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Trumps approval rating is 36% right now.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Brought to you by the same people that said Hillary would win based on polling data. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>He&#39;s passed no legislation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That isn&#39;t a function of the President, it&#39;s a function of Congress. Establishment Republicans are no different than establishment Democrats. Liberals would cry about the &quot;do nothing Congress&quot; under Obama, well guess what, we still have a &quot;do nothing Congress&quot;. Obama got &quot;his&quot; legislation passed because it was all globalist legislation, which is what most of our Congress supports. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>His Muslim ban has been shot down in every court of law it&#39;s come up in (and partially due to his own tweets).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s not a &quot;Muslim ban&quot; (I wouldn&#39;t care if it was) and to say so is disingenuous. Is Trump inarticulate in describing it? Sure, but like everything else in American life these days, the people making decisions are corrupt and controlled by a globalist agenda, so of course the activist judges running liberal courts are going to block everything. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>His national security advisor had to resign. His AG had to recuse himself.\</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Neither had to resign. They did so because it was seen as easier to do so and it was thought that doing so would help end this nonsense. Of course, that was a miscalculation and all it did was serve to give red meat to his opposition. Neither Sessions or Flynn will ever be in any trouble for any of this, because they have done nothing wrong, but the optics do look bad to people that only care how things look.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>He fired the FBI director, claimed it wasn&#39;t his idea and it was because of Hillary, then admitted it was his idea and it was because of Russia. And that led to a Special Counsel to investigate.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Jesus Christ dude, talk about spin. He didn&#39;t admit any such thing, because he was not under any investigation. Comey stated he wasn&#39;t under investigation in his testimony. Why would Trump fire Comey over Russia if there was no investigation? It&#39;s fucking ridiculous. Comey was fired because Comey is shit. He&#39;s a liar that can&#39;t/won&#39;t produce his &quot;memo&#39;s&quot; or notes. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The FBI director said Trump directed him to drop the investigation and claimed that because Trump lies so often he had to take notes on their conversations.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>False. There was no investigation. Comey said he had to take notes because he felt uncomfortable. He also said that Loretta Lynch directed him to call the Clinton investigation a &quot;matter&quot; and not an investigation. Did he take notes of their further meetings? No, of course not, because Comey is shit and isn&#39;t interested in justice or investigating anything. He&#39;s a partisan hack protecting the Clintons. End of story.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>He&#39;s given ethics wavers at 5 times the rate of Obama and hired his own family to be his key advisors despite his promise to &quot;drain the swamp&quot;.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Are you stupid? His family hasn&#39;t been involved in DC politics. They are not part of &quot;the swamp&quot;. As for the waivers? So what? I don&#39;t begrudge Obama or any President for issuing waivers. If you hire a guy to run say, Health and Human Services and he&#39;s worked for large insurance or medical corporations before, he&#39;s gonna need a waiver. To avoid the waiver would mean hiring someone not involved in that industry. Then we&#39;d get to listen to people like you complain that the appointment of said person &quot;isn&#39;t qualified&quot;, which is exactly what happened with Ben Carson. You are full of shit. The left is full of shit. The progressives, and SJW&#39;s and liberals are all full of shit. You are attacking a President before he&#39;s really even had a chance to do anything with nothing but hot air, innuendo and rumor. No evidence of any wrong doing, no witnesses. Nothing but your righteous indignation that you lost.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>He has already backtracked on his promise to not support health care legislation that drops people as the plan he supported will cause 23 million to lose insurance.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Which is really only allowing people forced to buy insurance by Obama the ability to decide for themselves if they want insurance or not. Free choice in the land of the free and home of the brave - the horror!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>He hasn&#39;t even gotten funds to build his promised wall and his first budget deal he got wrecked by Democrats.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Of course he hasn&#39;t. Congress is full of globalist douche bags that can&#39;t wait to import third worlders. You think because a person has an (R) next to their name they don&#39;t want the illegals here? Get real. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I mean, like it or not his presidency thus far has been a disaster.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>From the perspective of people that hated him before he was ever elected, of course it&#39;s been a disaster. From his supporters perspective, they don&#39;t agree. Sure, they&#39;d like to have seen more done, but they also know what he is up against. IMO, it&#39;s amazing he&#39;s accomplished any of the stuff he has. See that coal mine open up in PA? That&#39;s the kind of shit his supporters really care about. Remember Obama saying &quot;you can open a coal mine, but you&#39;ll go bankrupt&quot;? That&#39;s why he was hated so badly. Who the fuck is that little shit to tell the American people he&#39;s going to bankrupt them? That shit is worse than anything Trump has said or done. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>People here in this sub keep trying to act as if Obama and Trump were equal in their accomplishments and their demeanor but they&#39;re not.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You are right, they are not equals. Obama accomplished nothing in life until he became President. Once he was President, he was very accomplished in helping destroy the nation. Trump is erasing his legacy one item at a time. In 100 years, Obama will be remembered for being the first black man elected President and nothing more. Trump on the other hand has been successful in many areas before he ever ran for office. Obama won in &#39;08 with the media sucking his dick the whole way. Trump did it with his party, the left, the media, the deep state and most the rest of the world against him. You are right, Obama and Trump aren&#39;t equals. Obama isn&#39;t 1/10th the man Trump is. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Trump gets more negative press because so far his presidency has been overwhelmingly more negative than positive.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Trump gets more negative press because he&#39;s not a gay, trans, black communist working to hand the nation over to globalists that care nothing for the American people. </p>
