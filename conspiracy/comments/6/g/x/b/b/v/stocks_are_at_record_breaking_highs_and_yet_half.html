<p>theres a bigger &quot;game&quot; going on than the GvsE thing.  not many seem to be on that &quot;field,&quot; just enough to move the game along, but no where near how I feel it ought to be moving.  </p>

<p>im busy with life generally... too busy to care about some draconian infested greedy egotist who will only be remembered for their money getting skills. </p>

<p>If i were to print some random symbols and sayings onto a piece of paper, and would give it to some other guy and in exchange demands that he kills you OP. What could you blame me for?

    <div class="md"><p>I think the main argument about the poverty rates being wrong and under represented is that the poverty definition itself hasnt been updated since the 60s.  The metrics for poverty still expect someone in the household who can cook completely from scratch, and that 1/3 of the income is being spent on food.  Base line poverty rate is like 12k which seems substantially low.  There is a lot of info out there about whats wrong with our poverty metrics including a good number of peer reviewed studies.  </p>

<p>It&#39;s not hard at all. The elite have brainwashed you into thinking that. The only way to do something like this is with a &quot;Just do it&quot; attitude. No need to break any crimes. It is understandable that the people of the world want to get rid of evil pedophiles who fucked up the whole world from office. Do you think if we went 10,000 strong, knocked on the white house door, and demanded the pedos leave office that they will be surprised? They won&#39;t be surprised. They are expecting this to happen eventually and trying to wiggle their way out of the consequences as we speak. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>During the financial crisis (which is still ongoing) central banks created a LOT of new money. This money was used on stocks and bonds and the price was massively inflated. We were told that the money would help us through the trickle down effect. The Japanese central bank now owns over half of the Japanese stock market. This is madness. </p>

<p>For a decade now we have been robbed of interest on our savings by central bankers trying to encourage spending by making it less appealing to save. Interest was our only safeguard against inflation in a debt based currency system.</p>
