       This is because all those profits went to the top 1%. They are making a fortune by destroying our world while half the country lives hand over fist. To top things off, they don't pay taxes and are immune from the law.

       Why are you surprised? The redistribution of wealth has been going on under our noses. The NWO can't kill us outright, so they have found other ways. Look around you to see more.

       theres a bigger "game" going on than the GvsE thing.  not many seem to be on that "field," just enough to move the game along, but no where near how I feel it ought to be moving.

       Profit without prosperity (google it) its a loop hole opened up from deregulation companies buying there own stock back to inflate the numbers instead of expanding there businesses and hiring more employees.  Basically they legalized stock manipulation in the early 2000s that's where the tax cuts trickle down to not normal people.

       If i were to print some random symbols and sayings onto a piece of paper, and would give it to some other guy and in exchange demands that he kills you OP. What could you blame me for? Being immoral? Probably. But i didn't really commit any crimes. Isn't the more interesting and important question why the killer accepted the deal?

       Just curious, where are you getting half are in poverty? All the sources I see say more like 14%. Anyone can edit wikipedia, and it says 13.5%. Or are you using a different metric?

       I think the main argument about the poverty rates being wrong and under represented is that the poverty definition itself hasnt been updated since the 60s.  The metrics for poverty still expect someone in the household who can cook completely from scratch, and that 1/3 of the income is being spent on food.  Base line poverty rate is like 12k which seems substantially low.  There is a lot of info out there about whats wrong with our poverty metrics including a good number of peer reviewed studies.

       It's not hard at all. The elite have brainwashed you into thinking that. The only way to do something like this is with a "Just do it" attitude. No need to break any crimes. It is understandable that the people of the world want to get rid of evil pedophiles who fucked up the whole world from office. Do you think if we went 10,000 strong, knocked on the white house door, and demanded the pedos leave office that they will be surprised? They won't be surprised. They are expecting this to happen eventually and trying to wiggle their way out of the consequences as we speak.

       That's one step sure. Most people have no idea they are working for evil people but they need to be woken up by people like us.

       One thing we need to do is stop being afraid of the consequences of changing the world for the better. Instead, we should be worried about the consequences of not fixing the world.

       You're hilariously uninformed if you think "The military" is gonna go back to Kansas and start running down their neighbors. Even the optimistic ones in the brass know that their
       <em>

       Their realistic predictions give them 35% loyal troops, 10% saboteurs, and 5% of that 10 would be active informants. And, yes, 12g and 9mm do just fine against soft targets. Until you design a tank that can  arrest someone for dissent, that'll be fine enough.

       During the financial crisis (which is still ongoing) central banks created a LOT of new money. This money was used on stocks and bonds and the price was massively inflated. We were told that the money would help us through the trickle down effect. The Japanese central bank now owns over half of the Japanese stock market. This is madness.
      </p>
      <p>
       For a decade now we have been robbed of interest on our savings by central bankers trying to encourage spending by making it less appealing to save. Interest was our only safeguard against inflation in a debt based currency system.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am of the belief that Central bankers are not stupid. They know exactly what they are doing and are acting maliciously.

       All of the evil in existence is the result of self-serving behavior at the expense of others. These successful people care more about even more success for themselves than their race, country or locality. It's just the way they choose to be.
