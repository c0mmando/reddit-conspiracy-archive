        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;ve heard the idea before about how the firmament is a type of glass dome. I think thats bullshit. Unless falling stars and meteor showers are like some project bluebeam projection. Probably not. Things do penetrate the firmament, barrier, dome whatever it is that separates air from outer space. </p>

<p>What we have in the air let&#39;s call aether. This varies in Density. What&#39;s one variation of that that would be like water? Denser than air, denser than water. Not Rock. So plasma, Right?</p>

<p>The plasma is a type of barrier like the rubber on your car tires. We can explore it&#39;s scientific properties, but in concept. The Earths atmosphere is pressurized like the air in your tire. That&#39;s how things can explode and ignite and combust because they are under pressure. There is something working outside upon an object to keep it in place. Pressure and density are inter connected. </p>

<p>Plasma, this barrier, and they hide this truth in Ghostbusters programming, plasma has an effect that can connect our realm with the astral, or ghost plane, what have you. That&#39;s why you may hear the idea the firmament is a type of veil. Or there is a veil of separation. Well this plasma barrier has been hidden from us and it is separating us from an immense amount of understanding of our existence. NASA distracts from it, with their lies. This is actually a symbolic connection To the veil, and it&#39;s starting to thin. We make this choice as a collective to thin it, we have that power now, to expose NASA and what they hide.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Gravity? And it&#39;s not just like there is constant air going up and up and up. Air gets thinner and thinner into nothingness. There isn&#39;t this magic plane where on one side you have air and on that side cold vacuum of space it is steadily less dense air as you gain altitude, the temperature drops and eventually you have almost no air left. It is why climbers need to bring oxygen onto Everest. Not saying you are wrong or you are crazy this is just what I have experienced by climbing a few mountains and talking with people who have climbed higher mountains than me as well as some basic thinking about what I know of science </p>

    <div class="md"><p>In my theory the earth has no absolute shape because it reconfigures it&#39;s density and pressure quite often. I think depending on those two components of materialization it is never the same in any era.</p>

<p>Currently we as a consensus agree it&#39;s round. Others say flat. I say I don&#39;t know but I know it will never always be a constant form. But I do know I&#39;m on land, and there is air. And they tell us space is a vacuum. It&#39;s not sucking out the air so what&#39;s stopping it? Their reasoning is illogical. There must be a barrier and they never show it. All space pics of earth is cgi and artistic drawings. They don&#39;t show the plasma, or aknowledge it. I&#39;m not pushing dogma but it&#39;s in the bible. I&#39;m asking now in 2017, what separates us from the vacuum of space?</p>

<p>Freeman and Shatner I take with a grain of salt because I don&#39;t trust a single person in the luciferian entertainment industry. I didn&#39;t come to that decision overnight. But I only get info from every day people who figure shit out. I don&#39;t trust nasa, or pop culture, or msm. </p>

<p>Shatner with his question that made no sense whats so ever and then the follow up about actors crashing and burning, making Chris Laugh and be uncomfy like &quot;Yo lets see how you handle this bro&quot;</p>

<p>The way the commander laughs like a baffoon at the idea of floating pets or shit, he&#39;s no astronaut. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey man, just thought of another idea. Look at the sun and moon. I&#39;ve always suspected they were not thousands of miles away. No, they are lodged in this barrier of plasma.  Literally stuck there somehow and in some type of gyrating, or not quite perfectly circular path. The moon seems to be in some sort of electromagnetic relationship and synched up with it. Some are starting o think the moon is self illuminating. If it is tapped into this plasma barrier it may have some type of way to generate power through it.</p>

<p>Noticed the Chillies &#39;Californication&#39; and &#39;By the way&#39; albums covers on my wall, Californication I think its a picture depicting the vanishing point and perspective, notice the sea and sky flipped. Then By the way like the flat horizontal line across the eyes, the horizon is flat and always stays at eye level. </p>

<p>Space may be the final frontier but it&#39;s made in a Hollywood basement. More will be revealed my friend. Better bloody had. </p>

<p>We need to draw straws, controlled OD. Take a quick peak tell us what you see. Anything resembling a creator, the earths fucking flat. :P If only it were that easy... </p>
