       How likely do you think it is Trump is telling the truth.  he has tapes of Comey and that Comey lied under oath about what was said.
      </p>
      <p>
       If he has the tapes, I dont understand why he wouldn't release them in January, his first day in office.  Or the day Comey testified.  Or the day he fired him.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why wait?
      </p>
      <p>
       What possible motive does Trump have, if he's truthful, for waiting to release the tapes??

       It's irrelevant. The announcement of the "tapes" may have perfectly been a bluff that served to keep comey honest.

       It was a bad move. Saying that there are tapes of one oval office meeting leads to the idea that there are tapes of
       <em>
        every
       </em>
       oval office meeting he has.

       So? I see it as a wise move. Just see how his opponents are "demanding" him to release the tapes. All he has to do is say "no" to keep the bluff alive.

       If he's telling the truth, the FBI was spying on Trump long before he even got in the White House.  Its long been thought Trump fired Comey at that moment specifically because of where Comey was.  3000 miles away.  7 hours away.  Away from the office.  And that Trump/FBI/whoever them got all the tapes, and surveillance and all that info Comey was collecting on Trump.

       They WERE monitoring him.  They WERE monitoring and taping his calls and conversations.

       Twitter Trump never said there were tapes as a definitive.  It was, at best, ambiguous.  He said "Comey better hope".  It was a mindfuck.
      </p>
      <p>
       You think the head of the FBI and members of the senate / house didn't think WH convos may be recorded?  The only thing shocking to them is that he tweeted.  Not the possibility of tapes.  It may lead to the general public now thinking that but we're not subpoenaing the tapes so why does it matter?

       I don't like the game playing. I've had enough of Donald Trump turning everything into riddles and subterfuge. This is the great nation of the United States, not some b-rated TV show.

       why offer to testify under oath though?  A person guilty of the crime he's accused of, colluding with Russia to hack the elections, would never offer to testify under oath. Thats not a move guilty people make.

        I have tapes, believe me, they're the best tapes, really top notch stuff on my those tapes. But I am under no obligation to release those tapes, as great as they may be. Just incredible stuff on then though, those tapes!

       Not true at all. If you have a reason to believe that people are out to spread lies and propaganda against you, then you hold onto your evidence while they attack you. You let them continue and patiently hold your cards close.
      </p>
      <p>
       The more aggressive and the longer they attack you, the more ruined they will be when you pull out your evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whereas if you release your evidence immediately, less of your enemy's credibilty is hurt.

       When else would he need them?  This is the largest propaganda con in history-the russian narrative.  They are trying to take down a democratically elected president.  If he's telling the truth the former FBI director is lying about him...under oath and in public.
       <br/>
       A large part of the country believes he is some sort of evil fascist in collusion with Russia.  If he is telling the truth, he speaks facts and is told he's insane, and those who agree with him are peddling fake news.

       At what point would be the appropriate time?  How could things possibly get worse for him?

       No, not since Nixon. Nixon he'd illegally recorded tapes and when found out tried to claim executive privilege and not release them. This went all the way to the Supreme Court. Nixon lost. See US v. Nixon. This spurred his resignation.
