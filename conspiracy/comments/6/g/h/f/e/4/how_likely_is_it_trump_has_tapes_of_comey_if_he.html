<p>If he has the tapes, I dont understand why he wouldn&#39;t release them in January, his first day in office.  Or the day Comey testified.  Or the day he fired him.  </p>

<p>Why wait?  </p>

<p>What possible motive does Trump have, if he&#39;s truthful, for waiting to release the tapes??</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If he&#39;s telling the truth, the FBI was spying on Trump long before he even got in the White House.  Its long been thought Trump fired Comey at that moment specifically because of where Comey was.  3000 miles away.  7 hours away.  Away from the office.  And that Trump/FBI/whoever them got all the tapes, and surveillance and all that info Comey was collecting on Trump.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Twitter Trump never said there were tapes as a definitive.  It was, at best, ambiguous.  He said &quot;Comey better hope&quot;.  It was a mindfuck.  </p>

<p>You think the head of the FBI and members of the senate / house didn&#39;t think WH convos may be recorded?  The only thing shocking to them is that he tweeted.  Not the possibility of tapes.  It may lead to the general public now thinking that but we&#39;re not subpoenaing the tapes so why does it matter? </p>
