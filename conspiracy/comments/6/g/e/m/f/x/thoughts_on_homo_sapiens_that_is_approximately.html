<p>This news also means that we lived with two other sorts of &quot;humans&quot;. So not only the neanderthals, but  probably also the Homo Heidelbergs. Why did only we survive?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well. The reason we give to humans civilising the last 10.000 years is the climate change. Because we arent in an glacial anymore. But the homo sapiens have lived in other periods were there were no glacials, and we have no evidence that we civilised in those periods. We have always been the same homo sapiens, our brains havent changed. So you would expect that we would build advanced civilasations in those periods of interglacials. Right?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The brain changes in response to stimuli in an individuals lifetime. Its called plasticity. I think that, given this fact, saying our brains are &quot;the same&quot; as 100,000 years ago is only true in regard to certain specific traits, or perhaps as a measure of potential. But, in my opinion there is necessarily <em>some</em> difference, as a result of the impact of, for example, the development of culture.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, a brain may have the same structural capacity as our own but develop in different ways due to environment. An illiterate human whose life is spent hunting and gathering can be a very wise and fulfilled person, but fundamentally different from a human who grew up in the middle of Chicago with lead in the pipes and soil. It&#39;s also likely that we began selecting for intelligence more as tool use grew more refined. Even our understanding of the world is much more complex than we usually consider; those stacked-up concepts took generations to become &#39;normal.&#39;</p>

<p>Common sense says we think very differently than early people, but it&#39;s all within the bounds of human thought. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I 100% agree with you. Watching some of Graham Hancocks lectures, and the evidence of extremely old civilizations in the Americas really adds a lot of credence to this theory. It seems so improbable to me that we have not had more advanced civilizations in the past, simply because our understanding of history only goes back 10,000 years which coincides with the timing of the Old Testament. It&#39;s more likely that our civilization has collective amnesia reinforced by the simple fact that history is written by the victors and history is interpreted through our own biases of how we believe the world to be based on our society. Even if humans are 200,000 that&#39;s 190,000, or 95% of our history we barely know anything about. I believe that the Hindus and the Buddhists religions have a lot of really great truths to them, that may be far deeper than our limited modern understandings. Both religions emphasize the cycle of life, and if you start to look at nature and civilizations as cycles rather than linear paths, a whole new understanding of the world and our history starts to take shape.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Follower of a China buddhism checking in.</p>

<p>One of the teachings of my school is that civilization has risen and fallen many,many times over the course of history. After learning that, a lot of the ancient Hindu and Buddhist stories started sounding more  like historical accounts of past civilizations.  So much so that I sometimes find myself wondering if Hanuman was a Neanderthal or a Denisovan. Or if Ancient Aliens are actually Yeti Air Force pilots in their pressure suits.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>no it doesn&#39;t, not at all.</p>

<p>that the age of our species keeps being pushed back and that it might keep going back further is not earth shattering among paleontologists, and unlike those who publish videos on youtube based on nothing but some foggy understanding of palentology that has been refuted for 70 years, and shows complete ignorance of advances in our understanding made just in the last 5 years, has no agenda but curiosity. the true earth shattering paradigm on the horizon is that we are not from africa but eurasia, and possibly even asia itself. the truely most earth shattering paper that you heard nothing about because it is so evolutionary  based DNA SNP analysis is that we are substantial older, and I&#39;m talking over 20 million years than chimps and gorillas, and are the closestbto monkeys than they are. this was vindication for me as I&#39;ve been saying this for 20 years based on morphology and behavior.</p>

<p>the age of our species has nothing to due with pushing back the age of civilization. we have no bones to support large populations. you cannot have civilizations without at least one of them leaving at least some collection of bones indicating a large enough population to support a civilization. anthropoligists would be in 7th heaven to find new, oder cultures...they freak out just when they find new flint chips from earlier dates. egyptoligists are a fake thing, who do have agendas, they are not paid attention to by anthropoligists at all.</p>

<p>the remains found have been know about for decades. it was not an inability to age them that had kept them from being considered anatomically moder humans, but the fact that their skulls are clearly not anatomically modern. they have very archaic skulls--no forehead, no chin, noticeable prognathism, lack of a facial neotany. the moroccans cans have been fighting for these to be considered homo sapiens sapiens for decades.</p>

<p>i was taught by the 2nd most respected osteologist in the country in the 1990s.  she looked at the bones. period. she didn&#39;t care about where those bones fit in the pantheon, she considered only what they told her. she could look at bones and identify tuberculosis, syphilis, and rickets at a glance. she looked at these bones, with no dog in the fight, and said, homo erectus at a bizarrely late date...but we know some erectuses did hang on, florensiences hung on until 10,000 yreas ago. when she said this it was 15 years before we knew about florensiences.</p>

<p>what lies beneath the waves may show some earlier cultures, but the world was too cold and too dry to support agriculture until 10,000, and any that may have existed before 14,000 years ago, would almost certainly have been destroyed by the younger drys. we would be destroyed by the younger dryas.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are clearly more knowledgeable than I am in the subject, but in defense of my comment I will say that my point was that extending the existence of humanity back another 100,000 years would allow even more time for civilization to have developed and to have failed and been lost. It also would expand the areas in which such a civilization may have existed and the ways in which it may have been lost. </p>

<p>At the end of the day, does it really make a difference if as a species we have supposedly lived 100k year more than we first thought? I believe scientists believe we bred with neaderthals at some point, it&#39;s very possible we did so with any other humanoid species we came across.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Side story about lactose intolerant that is not really related to the post. However, there are economic theorists that say Europeans&#39; ability to digest lactose higher than any other region in the world is a big reason why Europe developed faster than any other region in the world. There are also a lot of other factors that helped Europe, but basically Europeans experience lactose intolerance at the lowest rate in the world. In fact, outside of the west, lactose intolerance is vey common. </p>

<p>Look into the vids this guy is making:</p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/d9bi9hnHifA">https://youtu.be/d9bi9hnHifA</a></p>

<p>He is supposing that many of these ancient sites were built around even older pre existing sites that had been destroyed by cataclysm, and then the next rebuilding civilisation comes along and builds off that site, but what they are building off of is just the tops of buried cities. </p>

<p>There are many covered up findings of giants. And some of these ancient sites the doorways, Windows, and steps or stairs are enormous. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks a lot for your reply. You are making it interesting. </p>

<p>What i know about this subject is that the Pyramids are older than the egyptians civilization. So they were built before their dynasty. Thats why nothing is written about how the egyptians made those pyramids, because they actually didnt make them. (the egyptians have written about almost everything they builded/made). But then at what time were they build? And how did they build them, with the technology we know today we cant even build them. This would be solved if we were civilized a long long time ago, and builded the pyramids with the advanced technology we had then.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the same. One fact about the pyramids and these oldest structures is there is no language inside them. The structure is it&#39;s own language, specifically the pyramids have a mathematical language, not a hieroglyphic one.</p>

<p>Same with the other structures similar to it.  But these other buildings and structures built around them were from a later date. You can tell the differences by studying the sites. The rocks are smaller, the math not precise, the technology forgotten. Forgotten in the aftermath of a type of extinction level event.</p>

<p>Archeologist in europe cant dig at many places, and when they have to do a research in a place, it is because we know something has already been there, and they have to check if there are valuable things at that particular place.

<p>See, what happens to metal, plastics, wood, and basically anything above ground exposed to the sun experiences chemical changes over many thousands of years.</p>

<p>Essentially it all turns to rock. Steel would rust and oxidize and turn to stone and the stone will have a orange tint to it. Petrified wood is just as fossilized and becomes stone.</p>

<p>I even think in some cases the structures in the past were at one time wood and metal that now look like carved rock. And even more curious is some of these ancient statues of giants that seem to be actual fossilized giants from a prehistoric cataclysm.</p>

It can even take some bottles 1000 years to biodegrade!</a></p>

<p>Now the Dark Age period after the Fall of Rome lasted about 1000 years, and that was only a minor, in-no-way-total civ collapse. One might think that after a total global collapse the dark period might last thousands if not tens of thousands of years - and this would still fit within the timeline lasting hundreds of thousands of years.</p>

<p>As for mining and oil extraction, it seems that over such a long time period strip mines would erode or be populated over.  Underground mines would collapse or could simply be attributed to later civs not the very early ones. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>A lot of theories concerning ancient civilizations conclude they had access to free energy (the pyramids, Adams Calendar), and lived in harmony with the planet. They were opposed to pollution, because they were civilized.</p>

<p>The concept of burning oil, creating plastics, and industrialization likely would have horrified past human civilizations. If anything these are not marks of progress, but in fact of form of devolution.</p>

<p>You&#39;re assuming that modern technology is somehow better than what they had. The reality likely was we simply had different yet equally advanced technologies. They likely leveraged natural systems for food, clean water, possibly energy, and we know based on ancient maps that they had to ability to calculate true North, longitude and latitude, knew the earth was round, etc. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The big deal here is agriculture. Food is <em>the</em> natural population limiter for every species on earth, so the timescale of Homo Sapiens&#39; existence is kind of irrelevant in the long run. If we were hunter-gatherers for an extra few hundred thousand years, that doesn&#39;t really change much, because the lifestyle and population of pre-agricultural man was still heavily limited. Once people figured out how to plant and harvest, the rest of society - laws, systems of exchange, written language, etc... - just kind of happened in rapid succession.</p>

<p>Either that or there was some kind of ancient mega-empire or something.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know. That&#39;s why I&#39;m not sure if we can accurately make the argument we are more civilized. </p>

<p>The word &quot;civilized&quot; was created to describe our technology advancements and the act of increasing quality of life. I&#39;m just not sure what we define as civilized actually increases our quality of life. It&#39;s a deception to make us believe our lives are better. TV, movies, video games, etc are all intended to distract us from the true reality of the world. The medical system is never about curing people, as that is not profitable. Why cure someone, when you could instead &quot;treat&quot; them for the rest of there lives for monthly payments to pharmacies, hospitals and don&#39;t forgot your insurance company. </p>

<p>When our corporations and governments take the lives of civilians in war zones as collateral damage that is unavoidable, it makes it hard to believe we are any different if we stood in the way of the PTB&#39;s goals. </p>

<p>Sorry to go on a tangent, but this reality is a frustrating place. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>While definitely interesting, the fact that they were also discovered with primitive stone hand tools limits my Graham Hancock fan excitement over this discovery some what, as it doesn&#39;t really change anything about our understanding except to show that we are slightly older and came from a different or larger part of Africa. The primitive skull shape just shows this to be another like (that may or may not have been &quot;missing&quot;) in the evolutionary chain.</p>

<p>I would expect accent nephelim monolithic civilization builders to have at least been able to figure out the technology to affix a stone blade to a stick.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve always suspected that humans have been around much longer. For one thing, the last ice age coupled with a following massive rise in sea level easily could have effectively wiped any evidence of previous civilization. I never bothered speculation exactly how advanced ancient, as of yet unknown civilizations would have been, but I&#39;ve never doubted that they existed. </p>

<p>Spitting distance from where I live, a village 14&#39;000 years old was recently discovered upsetting the modern scholarly view of the chronology of north america. It also confirmed the oral history of the first nations people along our coast, who kept extremely detailed records via generational storytelling in their bands. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe we&#39;re a very old species, we&#39;ll keep finding bits of evidence of ourselves going back even further than 300 000 years. We just never really learn from our mistakes, mostly because we can&#39;t remember them. I think we&#39;ve reached this stage before a few times, came together to form one or more civilizations and became globally connected, developed technology and advanced weapons, and inevitably used those advanced weapons on each other, decimating the physical structures and wiping out most of the evidence of their existence. It&#39;d take several thousand years to pick up the pieces and start again after a worldwide nuclear war, so whatever is leftover eventually erodes away to nothing/natural-looking features. Whoever is left over would have to survive on the absolute bare minimum for thousands of years before agriculture, thus eventually civilization, can develop again.</p>

<p>We&#39;ve already began preparing &quot;arks&quot; full of seeds and other biological material for the event of a worldwide catastrophe, who&#39;s to say we didn&#39;t do that before when we knew our self-destruction was inevitable? We only ever make an effort to change once our own mortality is staring at us in the face. We translate that into rabid last-ditch efforts of conservation of the environment when we know we&#39;re gonna fuck shit up big time and the planet won&#39;t be able to recover enough on it&#39;s own to support our shenanigans again. </p>
