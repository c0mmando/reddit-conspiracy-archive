       My local NPR station--WFCR ('Five College Radio' of Northampton &amp; Amherst, MA) is running their Spring fund drive.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lots of rich, white liberals live here, and the station loves to play testimonials of how well-informed and educated its listeners are.
      </p>
      <p>
       Confession: I have pledged in the past--so sorry. I don't anymore because for a long time I have been fed up with their anti-progressive, anti-Palestinian, pro-corporatist agenda, etc, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's no big deal if I don't pledge, right? If they don't hit their pledge goals, won't some secret alphabet agency funnel money through a charity to make sure they can pay their bills?
      </p>
      <p>
       SIDE: Any other recommendations for real progressive radio I can listen to? I already listen to Counterspin, and On The Media.

       If you don't donate the conservative billionaires will make up the difference, PRI/NPR is nothing but tax subsidized conservative propaganda for more than a decade now.
      </p>
      <p>
       Glad to see someone else remark on what a pile of Sh-- they are now.
      </p>
      <p>
       This was achieved by cutting their tax funding to around 25% so that the private donor organizations can claim, "we provide the majority of the funds and we determine the content."
      </p>
      <p>
       And the content is revolting.

       Reddit openly played ads on their sidebar urging people to donate to the aclu during Trump's inauguration, and I think at one point after the election r/politics was collecting donations for the site 'motherjones'. We're in the thick of it.

       The ACLU walks a precarious tight rope....always.
      </p>
      <p>
       In order to protect free speech and not appear to be hypocritical, they sometimes have to take a stand on policies that just seem flaky; Citizens United as an example.
      </p>
      <p>
       The very nature of the ACLU forces us to watch them and analyze their perspective on issues. Right now, these are the only guys who appear to be fighting for the individual citizen.

       That, if it private gun ownership was only made legal by the Heller case, then why have Americans enjoyed this right since
       <em>
        prior to the Declaration?
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       That's what I'll never understand about this argument.
      </p>
      <p>
       Plus, the "militia" folks.  It's like they're intentionall yignoring
       <em>
        the fact
       </em>
       that back then the "militia" was everyday people like you and me.  Minutemen were known for having their rifle and ammo ready to go at a moments notice, hence their name.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        <em>
         Minutemen were *
        </em>
        civilian colonists who independently organized** to form well-prepared militia companies self-trained in weaponry, tactics, and military strategies from the American colonial partisan militia during the American Revolutionary War. They were also known for being ready at a minute's notice, hence the name.*
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       They argue the 2nd amendment only applies to Militias, but what they fail to include with that reasoning is that the Militia is made up of regular citizens who took their guns home with them.  They seem to think militia = military, and guns should be kept in barracks.  That is not what a militia is, nor has it ever been.

       NPR is an unforgivably biased liberal propaganda station.  Anyone who doesn't realize this is a one dimensional idiot; they never bothered to consider the fact that there are multiple ways to interpret the information and therefore assume the narrative to be the only way to understand the situations.

       The think tank people that go onto the Diane Rheem* show are very skilled wordsmiths.  They will begin a arguing a point against a previous statement, but by the end of the sentence it's in agreement with the previous comment.  This way one message gets sent out to the listeners.

       I listen to it on my way to work, it's on my local college station in the mornings, and it's the only channel my radio picks up.  It's always been pretty liberal but that didn't really bother me, they covered lots of "sticking it to the man" type things that other news networks wouldn't cover.  Well, up until this election cycle, it was listenable, and informative.  After that, holy shit, what a downward spiral.  They have literally been spending 3/4 of their program, every day for over a year now, spent solely on bashing Donald Trump for the most ridiculous unverified things (piss dossier, etc), while casually not bringing up any of the Democrat dirt for more than a few seconds just to say that they covered it.

       They are, at this point, probably THE most biased news program that I'm aware of.  They don't try to hide it either.  And that's their right I suppose, but I do wonder if their radio air time would be better spent reporting on a lot of the other crap going on, the stuff like they used to report on B.T. (Before Trump).  There is so much other shit going on out there in the world that a program like that could report on.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've heard people saying that they don't take large checks from big donors or anything like that.  But their coverage reeks of the same Media Matters / John Podesta / Soros / Democratic talking points as all of the other big liberal news companies out there right now.  They're like the radio version of the Washington Post.

       NPR at least gives airtime to opponents of topics and promoted perspectives, often leading to the types of back and forth discussions you will not find anywhere on mainstream conservative talk radio, for instance, where you either get CNP circlejerk or contrarian callers getting blunted by hosts in primetime entertainment fashion. Frequently these add nuance to topics and note that other opinions exist. They are a liberal outfit through and through, no doubt, but their approach is more centrist than anything.

       You won't be hearing much far right or far left perspectives, there's a level of sanitation involved for sure, as well as a company line. Fortunately there's plenty of other avenues for all perspectives available sub-AM radio if you know where to look and whom to trust.

       You realize local NPR stations are affiliates right? They don't get that money. In fact they have to pay places like NPR, PRI, and PRX for content. That's why they need the drives. There is no nation NPR drive.
