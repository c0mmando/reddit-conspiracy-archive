    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d agree. I actually have kind of a pet theory that this may be a trait/ability passed down from far older human civilizations (pre-Deluge). Yes, uncontrolled an &quot;evil&quot; entity can make you do bad things in schizophrenics, but properly learning how to deal and interact with them may be key into discover the &quot;light&quot; entities, and the various dimensions we all inhabit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A prime function of the mind is to filter out input that we would otherwise perceive. Sometimes this filtering mechanism gets broke and people &#39;hear voices&#39; and other stuff. Sometimes its really hard for people with this to fit in with &#39;normal&#39; society who then brand them as &#39;mad&#39;. The voices (and other phenomena) sometimes do not seem to be merely fabrications of a disordered mind, but something received on a wavelength most of us have tuned out.</p>

<p>Schizophrenia is a label for something we hardly understand at all, and no doubt there are occasions when its diagnosis is misused for nefarious ends. We are probably all guilty of putting barriers between ourselves and those to who we feel different. I like the term &#39;neurological diversity&#39;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Mhmm, I can see this being true. I mean look at how much money and energy goes into educating people about mental illnesses and depression and how much money the pharmaceutical companies make off of drugs. It could very well be possible that this money is going towards black projects, and then the mental illnesses are being used to not only cover them up, but generate profits. Or these group have learned how to create them, in order to delete peoples memories while working on government projects too.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have schizophrenia and I&#39;m heavily medicated in order to function on a somewhat normal level. </p>

<p>When I believed in God and demons and the super natural it was much harder to stay grounded. It was much hard to differentiate between real and not.  Now that I firmly do not believe in any of the above, I can better observe my hallucinations and call them what they are. Hallucinations. </p>

<p>Unfortunately, even medicated I have days where I will fall into a delusion.  Recently, my local grocery store did some remodeling.  It&#39;s the only store that I can grocery shop at by myself. I walked to find them halfway through remodeling and my mind twisted itself into thinking that they had rewired the entire store to watch me like the Truman show and I almost started raging at the customer service desk. Thankfully my husband was there to talk me through it and the manager knew me since childhood (I&#39;ve had schizophrenia since 6 years old and the store hadn&#39;t been remodeled since it had been built in 1989 and this happened a month ago) and she came and talked with me about the remodeling and why it needed to be done and was very patient with me.</p>

<p>Schizophrenia is very real and is not a manufactured diagnosis.  Coherently, I do not believe I can speak with another dimension or with souls or I&#39;m possessed or any of those things. To believe in those things would cause me to be less grounded and more susceptible to other illogical delusions.  My day is spent playing a logic game. Does this make sense? Could this happen? What is the likely hood of this happening? Is anyone else seeing this? Etc.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Im very curious about schizophrenia, since a few years ago I was heavily addicted to crystal meth and had very vivid hallucinations and paranoid delusions. I managed to escape that life, however people say once you have been in that state it is much easier to re-enter it, and the damage caused by the drugs, malnutrition, etc are sure to leave permanent effects on me. I would say it is easy for me to think people are out to make fun of me, or take advantage of me at times, since I am a pretty meek person, but I think I am very lucky that I have not returned to that full blown state yet, although at times I did enjoy the craziness. </p>

<p>If you do LSD you might not come out of it etc...My best friends aunt knew a girl who turned into a banana and never left the house again because she was worried someone might peel her.</p>

<p>But she has a point, meth isn&#39;t anything to mess with. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My brother is schizophrenic, and he was diagnosed at the age of five, which is very young to be given that diagnosis.</p>

<p>I saw a psychic once who (without me mentioning anything about my brother&#39;s illness) got in contact with my spirit guide. According to my spirit guide via the psychic, my guide wanted to tell me something &quot;interesting&quot; about my brother. She said that in a past life, my brother died very traumatically and violently in a war-like situation. She said his violent death &quot;splintered&quot; him, and he was essentially born with PTSD. So in this life, his &quot;psychic openings&quot; are so extreme and violent, that it basically manifested in what doctors called schizophrenia.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t really know what to make of it. But I&#39;ve always wondered how my brother&#39;s life could be different if his illness was treated differently. He has only been medicated and shuffled in and out of mental hospitals his whole life. My family offered him no spiritual or non-medical treatment options whatsoever. And I&#39;m not in anyway making a blanket statement about medication vs spiritual care. I just wonder how things could have gone for my brother if my parents had approached this in a more holistic way.</p>
