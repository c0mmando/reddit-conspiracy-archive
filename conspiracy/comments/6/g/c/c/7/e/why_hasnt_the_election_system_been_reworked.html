To give you an idea how big 256 bits is, it&#39;s roughly equal to the number of atoms in the universe!&quot; &quot;The RSA-129 key is approximately equal in security to a 426-bit PGP key. This has been shown to be easily crackable by this project. PGP used to recommend 384-bit keys as &quot;casual grade&quot; security; recent versions offer 768 bits as a recommended minimum security level.&quot; In other words, uncrackable unless the passphrase is weak and is broken using a brute force attack.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>100+ years isn&#39;t enough to break current cryptology.</p>

<p>Q: Can&#39;t you break PGP by trying all of the possible keys?</p>

<p>A: This is one of the first questions that people ask when they are first introduced to cryptography. They do not understand the size of the problem. For the IDEA encryption scheme, a 128 bit key is required. Any one of the 2 (to the 128 power) possible combinations would be legal as a key, and only that one key would successfully decrypt the message. Let&#39;s say that you had developed a special purpose chip that could try a billion keys per second. This is far beyond anything that could really be developed today. Let&#39;s also say that you could afford to throw a billion such chips at the problem at the same time. It would still require over 10,000,000,000,000 years to try all of the possible 128 bit keys. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This would have the same problems as Wall Street presents us with, and that is: &quot;Most people are too dumb/uneducated/lazy to understand what exactly the hell is going on (with a process that is fundamentally VERY simple), and therefore are ignorant when/if blatant fraud committed in clear sight.&quot; </p>

<p>Since the ignorance is there, they have no choice but to trust what the &quot;experts&quot; say. Sadly, in our selfish modern society, &quot;experts&quot; are often easily corrupted/bought (and the few uncorruptibles that exist will only be around for a certain period of time, so you can &quot;wait them out&quot; and eventually replace them). </p>

<p>TPTB play the long game, always.</p>

<p>Paper ballots counted and hand-separated is something that even a completely uneducated local yokel with an IQ of 90 can understand. No experts needed. </p>

<p>Physical paper means there is literal physical evidence of what happened. With <em>ANYTHING</em> computerized you have to trust the software. You have to trust that what you entered matches what is in the database. And as any database administrator will tell you, there are an absolutely ENORMOUS amount of places between &quot;client code&quot; and &quot;what actually ends up in the database&quot;, that could be corrupted to modify your vote. So the only way to mitigate this is by providing ALL VOTERS access to the same exact data, in the same exact format, accessed via the exact same code (as the system used for &quot;counting&quot; said votes). And doing that means you MUST be able to verify your vote after-the-fact. Which then allows your vote to be easily corrupted (boss requires you to vote for X, then after-the-fact makes you validate your vote in front of him, or get fired. if you did not vote for X you get fired). Same goes for paper voting reciepts, etc...</p>

<p>In order to make a computer system TRULY human-auditable, you would have to create a ROM device that is large enough to hold <em>ALL</em> software for the entire system. This ROM device would have to have a viewing port that allowed visual access to the actual transistors that held the ROM bits, and that those transistors were designed to appear physically different based on the charge that they hold (charged = &quot;white light&quot;, un-charged = &quot;dark&quot;). This ROM chip would have to be displayed prominently and it&#39;s contents would have to be organized in a human readable format, with every single bit/byte visible to every human using the system. </p>

<p>Kind of like how engineers could go look at which vacuum tubes were lit up in the ENIAC and figure out what code is running, and what values are in memory at a given time (and de-bug it, sometimes literally). </p>

<p>If a system cannot be manually audited by every human, without any special tools or experience (natural senses only - eyes, ears, mouth, nose, touch) - there is some degree of &quot;trust&quot; there.</p>

<p>There is really just no way to make electronic voting as secure as paper, without concentrating our collective trust in the hands of a few corruptible humans.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>People have tried to do electronic voting before but it is incredibly difficult to create a security system capable of withstanding a state level actor like Russia with cash, time, and huge incentives. Because of the peculiarities of the US, registering is difficult too - if somebody else was born in the same hospital as you, they literally have the next number in sequence from you. If someone found a stolen social security number, they could potentially register thousands of voters. All in all, it&#39;s simply very difficult to create an electronic voting system without wide-ranging and politically difficult reforms. The current system works well enough - why does it need to be electronic?</p>
