       Who doesn't have access to a computer at this point in time? Everyone has family or friends with access to a computer. Set up a .gov website, have everyone register using social security #s and let the voting begin. This is outrageous that the internet hasn't changed the way votes are counted. Same thing with local elections. Open source code and lets get the ball moving!

       Yes. Every person's vote should count equally. The super delegates practice among others kills any hope for a real election.

       I would definitely agree with those. One big thing about voting, is the ability to do it relatively anonymously. This was a huge problem back in the day with voter intimidation. Hooking any PI
       <em>
        with who you voted for
       </em>
       , is a bad bad idea, imo.

       Exactly. What's to stop a tyrannical admin from finding out which citizens voted for their opponent, then showing up in the middle of the night, kidnapping them, and taking them to a "reduction camp". May sound like something out of a dystopian movie, but it's not far fetched as the countless times this has happen in history. There is a reason we have the 2nd amendment in the US, as I'm sure you're well aware of.

       When medical information is stored with your name on it and then stripped of identity and sold to marketing companies, your identity is safe. Same logic. I agree it would be a logistical nightmare but its not impossible.

       If secure and verified I don't see why not. The amount of money spent on elections could be used to set up a team of tech guru's that verify identities. If the site is secure and identities are verified I don't see why this wouldn't work. Think of a big company with their own routers and networks and home user VPN into the network. If worked right it would be the turning point to true democracy

       It opens a big can of worms, imo. Rather than decentralization it centralizes  things
       <em>
        even more
       </em>
       . You would need databases and software that are immune to hacking/exploits. If you know anything about technology, you know that is improbably. Anything can be hacked, there is always someone smarter, and monetarily/politically, this would be a gold mind.

       "But with 256-bit AES encryption, that moves the date out another 192 years before computers are predicted to be fast enough to even attempt a massively distributed attack.  To give you an idea how big 256 bits is, it's roughly equal to the number of atoms in the universe!" "The RSA-129 key is approximately equal in security to a 426-bit PGP key. This has been shown to be easily crackable by this project. PGP used to recommend 384-bit keys as "casual grade" security; recent versions offer 768 bits as a recommended minimum security level." In other words, uncrackable unless the passphrase is weak and is broken using a brute force attack.

       You're thinking about this on a level of what the private sector has and what the military/Intelligence agencies tell you. Not too mention, there are theories of Breakaway Civilization Technology. Quantum computer has hit the private sector, generally we can assume tech private tech is ~10-15 years behind what the military has. If there is a Break Away Civilization, the military tech would be ~100+
       <em>
        years behind it

       or far more.

       100+ years isn't enough to break current cryptology.
      </p>
      <p>
       Q: Can't you break PGP by trying all of the possible keys?
      </p>
      <p>
       A: This is one of the first questions that people ask when they are first introduced to cryptography. They do not understand the size of the problem. For the IDEA encryption scheme, a 128 bit key is required. Any one of the 2 (to the 128 power) possible combinations would be legal as a key, and only that one key would successfully decrypt the message. Let's say that you had developed a special purpose chip that could try a billion keys per second. This is far beyond anything that could really be developed today. Let's also say that you could afford to throw a billion such chips at the problem at the same time. It would still require over 10,000,000,000,000 years to try all of the possible 128 bit keys.

       You obviously have zero knowledge of quantum computing and how it reduces nearly all factorization-problems like that to O(1).

       I just worry that this type of doing is what lead to the Great Deluge. Humans, trying to act as the Creator.. We cannot, nor is this place/experience for that... My thoughts are not complete, but I do feel the arrogance of man, is the downfall of man. To deny intelligent creation after all that we know, is to be arrogant as fuck, imo...

       May be the case. I tend to think that this is what the demi-urge wants from us though. These endeavours do not come to fruition unless they get MAJOR financial backing. And to just go unnoticed while creating such breakthroughs simply cannot happen in this reality. If the real powers that be did not want you to break through with something, you'd be gone.

       This would have the same problems as Wall Street presents us with, and that is: "Most people are too dumb/uneducated/lazy to understand what exactly the hell is going on (with a process that is fundamentally VERY simple), and therefore are ignorant when/if blatant fraud committed in clear sight."
      </p>
      <p>
       Since the ignorance is there, they have no choice but to trust what the "experts" say. Sadly, in our selfish modern society, "experts" are often easily corrupted/bought (and the few uncorruptibles that exist will only be around for a certain period of time, so you can "wait them out" and eventually replace them).
      </p>
      <p>
       TPTB play the long game, always.
      </p>
      <p>
       Paper ballots counted and hand-separated is something that even a completely uneducated local yokel with an IQ of 90 can understand. No experts needed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Physical paper means there is literal physical evidence of what happened. With
       <em>
        ANYTHING
       </em>
       computerized you have to trust the software. You have to trust that what you entered matches what is in the database. And as any database administrator will tell you, there are an absolutely ENORMOUS amount of places between "client code" and "what actually ends up in the database", that could be corrupted to modify your vote. So the only way to mitigate this is by providing ALL VOTERS access to the same exact data, in the same exact format, accessed via the exact same code (as the system used for "counting" said votes). And doing that means you MUST be able to verify your vote after-the-fact. Which then allows your vote to be easily corrupted (boss requires you to vote for X, then after-the-fact makes you validate your vote in front of him, or get fired. if you did not vote for X you get fired). Same goes for paper voting reciepts, etc...
      </p>
      <p>
       In order to make a computer system TRULY human-auditable, you would have to create a ROM device that is large enough to hold
       <em>
        ALL
       </em>
       software for the entire system. This ROM device would have to have a viewing port that allowed visual access to the actual transistors that held the ROM bits, and that those transistors were designed to appear physically different based on the charge that they hold (charged = "white light", un-charged = "dark"). This ROM chip would have to be displayed prominently and it's contents would have to be organized in a human readable format, with every single bit/byte visible to every human using the system.
      </p>
      <p>
       Kind of like how engineers could go look at which vacuum tubes were lit up in the ENIAC and figure out what code is running, and what values are in memory at a given time (and de-bug it, sometimes literally).
      </p>
      <p>
       If a system cannot be manually audited by every human, without any special tools or experience (natural senses only - eyes, ears, mouth, nose, touch) - there is some degree of "trust" there.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is really just no way to make electronic voting as secure as paper, without concentrating our collective trust in the hands of a few corruptible humans.

       People have tried to do electronic voting before but it is incredibly difficult to create a security system capable of withstanding a state level actor like Russia with cash, time, and huge incentives. Because of the peculiarities of the US, registering is difficult too - if somebody else was born in the same hospital as you, they literally have the next number in sequence from you. If someone found a stolen social security number, they could potentially register thousands of voters. All in all, it's simply very difficult to create an electronic voting system without wide-ranging and politically difficult reforms. The current system works well enough - why does it need to be electronic?

       Because you have super delegates, you have senators, governors that all have a say. So if I don't agree with senator A and a bill gets passed because he voted for it, that is unfair especially if &gt;50% of the people disagree.

       Internet voting is insane.
      </p>

       Don't even need voter registration. That purple finger dye stuff is the best tool out there. Just need to eliminate all absentee voting and early voting.

       Sure, make it electronic, make it a webpage! And every election you'll be told exactly who won, don't you worry.

       Internet voting is maybe the worst idea you could have. There are just way too many things out of anyone's sight that could be fiddled with.
