        <h3 class="title">Liquid Natural Gas conspiracy tied to Qatar?</h3>
        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">39</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2017-06-09 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/ver0egiusto.html">ver0egiusto</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>One of the key things that stood out to me when reading articles about the &quot;Qatar Crisis&quot; and all of the Gulf states cutting diplomatic ties with them was the consistent mention of how the country earned its wealth -- as a significant Natural Gas exporter.</p>

<p>Saw this article today, how the Qatar crisis is causing Liquid Natural Gas prices to surge in the UK:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-gulf-qatar-lng-usa-idUSKBN18Z1LK">https://www.reuters.com/article/us-gulf-qatar-lng-usa-idUSKBN18Z1LK</a></p>

<p>Also saw that today, the US shipped its first tanker of LNG to Poland, establishing a footprint in the LNG market in central Europe -- video statement below. Also, articles propagandizing the move as Poland taking a &quot;significant step forward in wresting itself from Russiaâ€™s energy dominance&quot; like the one below.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NudaaA9kDRA">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NudaaA9kDRA</a></p>

<p><a href="http://foreignpolicy.com/2017/06/08/first-u-s-natural-gas-shipped-to-poland/">http://foreignpolicy.com/2017/06/08/first-u-s-natural-gas-shipped-to-poland/</a></p>

<p>In the video, US State Department spokesperson Heather Nauert mentions the name of the company facilitating this entire who-knows-how-many-billions-of-dollars endeavor. <a href="http://www.cheniere.com/">Cheniere Energy</a>. This company, a massive entity that is being contracted by the United States, does not have a wikipedia page in English. There was one in German though that I looked into and found a name for the former CEO. </p>

<p>The former CEO of the company, Charif Souki, does have a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charif_Souki">wiki page</a>. He left the company after &quot;differences with Board member Carl Ichan.&quot; Yes, <strong>Special Advisor to the President on Regulatory Reform Carl Ichan is a board member for Cheniere Energy.</strong></p>

<p>These days Souki is heading Tellurian Investments, an investment company in the LNG space that strives to &quot;Secure low-cost natural gas&quot; among other <a href="http://www.tellurianinc.com/about-us">ominous-sounding objectives</a> in light of the Qatar crisis. Apparently the company &quot;expects to earn no revenue until 2022, and needs to raise between $13.0 billion and $15.6 billion in order for its LNG project to proceed.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4045564-tellurian-stock-decline-following-issuance-190-million-new-shares">https://seekingalpha.com/article/4045564-tellurian-stock-decline-following-issuance-190-million-new-shares</a></p>

<p>The other head of Tellurian is <a href="http://www.oilandgascouncil.com/content/martin-houstonexecutive-vice-chairman-tellurian-investments">Martin Houston</a> , a member of the <a href="http://www.oilandgascouncil.com/executive-team">Oil And Gas Council</a>. Looks like a nice think tank with a price fixing objective in 2022 once their &quot;project&quot; is completed. Perhaps their Project being a pipeline from an overthrown Qatar.</p>

<p>The US cannot compete with Russian energy as is right now. Countries buy orders-of-magnitude more expensive Nagural Gas from the US just to spit in Russia&#39;s face, but this is not sustainable. In order to keep this business line open, and more importantly, profitiable, the US needs to secure a cheaper way to get gas into Europe. Artificially high prices for electricity/gas/etc. for European citizens due to political grandstanding against Russia is not sustainable. Citizens are getting mad.</p>

<p>Natural-Gas-rich Qatar, surrounded by aggravated and aggressive US allies, is looking like a nice ground zero for a 2022 completed pipeline project if you ask me. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So, all Europe would need to do to relieve its onerous energy costs is to accept natural gas from Russia?</p>

<p>Well, not very often you can point a finger at one tiny thing and explain why most of the world is fucked the way it is, but I think I can point that finger.</p>

<p>What can be done though? How do you Europeans feel about this?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Russia has been willing to use its energy supplies to achieve political outcomes in the past. Additionally, Russia supplies a lot of natural gas to Europe. So, I&#39;d imagine Europeans would look at you questioningly.</p>
