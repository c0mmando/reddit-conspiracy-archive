      <p>
       You don’t have to believe me, but at least take what I say, apply it to your own experience, and judge from there.
      </p>
      <p>
       We are living during an
       <em>
        insane
       </em>
       time. Literally, as individuals, humans are insane. Even those who haven’t been labeled schizophrenic, or mentally ill in any way, are insane. As a matter of fact, if you
       <em>
        haven’t
       </em>
       been labeled mentally ill already, you’re likely more insane than those who
       <em>
        have
       </em>
       been labeled mentally ill. How so?
      </p>
      <p>
       Individually, humanity currently believes that what it literally is is its own thoughts. We literally believe that we are our identity, rather than the life force in which our identity has developed since birth.
      </p>
      <p>
       We believe we are an illusion, rather than the truth. And what happens when a society collectively believes in something other than what’s true? The world begins to fall apart; and look around. Is the world ‘together’?
      </p>
      <p>
       Being on r/conspiracy, I think it’s fair to say that the majority of us are here to learn because we’ve discovered something unusual about our reality. Whether it be spiritual corruption, economic corruption, political corruption, educational corruption, or what have you, there is
       <em>
        so much
       </em>
       corruption right now.
      </p>
      <p>
       People cannot help but find themselves curious about what’s going on behind the scenes of the mainstream narrative. The question, “What’s
       <em>
        really
       </em>
       true?” is surfacing from within people more and more often, in my experience.
      </p>
      <p>
       But, for a moment, forget what’s true regarding the state of the world. You have plenty of time for that later. Forget what’s true regarding your
       <em>
        external
       </em>
       world and, for a second, consider what’s true with regard to your
       <em>
        inner
       </em>
       world.
      </p>
      <p>
       What is this ‘I’ sensation? What am ‘I’? I mean, seriously. What are you? That person reading these words; what is it? If you don’t know where I’m going with this yet, you likely believe yourself to be an identity. I am so-and-so, who enjoys X and hates Y, who prefers V and avoids Z. But, that thing, that identity, that identification for which you live your life…what is it?
      </p>
      <p>
       When we’re born, we have yet to develop a center within consciousness. We are purely the moment, which is pure consciousness, pure awareness. We have yet to attach to things, concepts, experiences of good and bad. Our brain has yet to develop to the point where it searches for meaning. We have yet to listen to our parents telling us who we are, giving us a name, telling us we are this or that, that we will spend our lives becoming this or that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Prior to all of those thoughts regarding who you are is a life-force — that life force is consciousness, or awareness — in which those thoughts have always occurred. Thus, fundamentally speaking,
       <em>
        you are not anything you have ever thought you were
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Each of us is a manifestation of the universe; a self-aware being, whose observer is Life, itself. This isn’t ‘your’ life. This isn’t ‘your’ body. In one sense, yeah, it is your life. You are certainly ‘you’, in that body, right here, right now. But the thing you identity as is
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       what you are. Yet, the majority of humanity literally believes it is its thoughts.
      </p>
      <p>
       The majority of humanity believes they are their thoughts, which might say things like, “You aren’t good enough. You’re white, and that person is black, so you should feel separate from them based on what your grandparents tell you, or based on the News special you saw last night that said black people are criminals. You’re in great shape; that overweight person over there should get their shit together! You need to work harder. You are a piece of shiz. You are better than everyone. No one will be as good as you. I hate that person. I hate this life. I can’t take life anymore.”
      </p>
      <p>
       We
       <em>
        believe
       </em>
       these outrageous thoughts we have, and then we formulate an identity, a judger, a center within consciousness, through which we then perceive
       <em>
        all
       </em>
       of life. Literally, all of life, then, takes on the illusory shade of color that your false identity projects out into the world. All of life is then judged through this illusory paradigm of ego/identity, which is inherently dissatisfied and anxious. Thus, we are always once-removed from what's
       <em>
        actually
       </em>
       true and real.
      </p>
      <p>
       These thoughts are ridiculous because our culture is ridiculous, but those of us with a shred of intellect can honestly and objectively observe this culture and understand that it is lead by people with evil intentions. TPTB fundamentally do not want us to come to the conclusion that each of us is Life, itself. Why?
      </p>
      <p>
       Because when you conclude experientially that you are not your thoughts and that you are the consciousness in which your thoughts have arisen, your experience
       <em>
        does
       </em>
       change. You don’t become some God-like being. But, you stop worrying. You remember beauty, you remember peace, you remember who you are.
      </p>
      <p>
       You realize that separation is an illusion. You realize that, despite color, size, demographic, or opinion,
       <em>
        every human is your brother or sister
       </em>
       . You experience
       <em>
        true
       </em>
       unity, because no longer is there this illusory identity that is judging all things.
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        THIS
       </em>
       is the truth we need to focus on, right now, I feel. Things are happening, man. Doesn’t it
       <em>
        feel
       </em>
       like shit is picking up? Doesn’t it feel like the corruption is surfacing for a reason?
      </p>
      <p>
       Climate change is picking up, just like how a human’s inner-weather oscillates strangely when recovering from illness. Political corruption, which we’ve been veiled from, is exposing itself more than ever before. The Earth’s heartbeat, known as the Schumann Resonance, is reaching higher points than ever before. Things are happening out in space that have never happened before. Human beings are awakening at a more incessant and widespread rate than ever before.
       <em>
        Why?
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       Listen, I know this sounds schizophrenic, and I have no literal proof to bring to you guys, so take this as you will. I’ve spent the past year in solitude after recognizing the fact that I had spent a lifetime in depression because I believed I was my thoughts. Then, I recognized that I was the universe here to experience itself and that my individual understanding of reality was an illusion.
      </p>
      <p>
       In truth, I’d never really been ‘here’ before. I’d never really been completely immersed and engulfed in the moment, other than times of pure awe. But now I live in that state. I still have conditionings I need to let go of, but I am remembering who I am, and life really is absolutely beautiful.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am remembering true love; not the false love that currently runs our world in which we demand that love be returned. Rather, true love is when you love selflessly, for nothing in return.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, and sorry for the tangents, I believe we are nearing a time in our reality when we either come together or we don’t. We either win, or we lose. We unite, or we fall deeper into separation.
      </p>
      <p>
       I just feel as though there are too many signs that we are nearing
       <em>
        something
       </em>
       , some point in this universal timeline where those who do good find themselves in a better place, and those who enjoy the bad find themselves in a similar frequency-based reality.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do not mean to provoke fear or anxiety; I hope to, instead, provoke truth and awareness. We need to come together; we need to share truth with everyone we love. We need to remember who and what we
       <em>
        really
       </em>
       are.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are just too many signs that big change is on the way. What does that mean? I cannot say. However, I can direct you to a Youtube link regarding a user whom I believe speaks
       <em>
        profound
       </em>
       truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2Zcqmbn50U">
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2Zcqmbn50U
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Forget that thing within you that judges people, places, things. Forget it. It isn’t real. Allow yourself to remember who you are, to remember what’s true, to remember that unbelievably powerful love that sits within. Call me a hippy, call me a nut job. But at least I tried to spread my truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thanks, guys. One love.

       This is dope. I feel what you're feeling. I don't know what's up, but after nearly 50 years on this mortal coil, something is definitely different. It's that feeling when you experience something life-changing for the first time, only the experiential arc is decades long, not mere seconds or minutes. It's that moment right before your jump off the high diving board for the first time, but in extreme slow motion. Unlike the diving board, where we know we're going to break the surface of the water after we jump, we don't know how long this arc is going to last and what's waiting for us at the end.

       As a younger member here (20s), I realise that I don't have enough experience to fully make sense of everything yet, so it's nice to have agreement with the elders.

       This is going to make me sound nutter than already certified to be but ... When I was a kid, I remember having intense thoughts of, "I'm me" and that "me" was entirely different than the "me" I knew.  It was like I could almost separate the two of me.  A form of disassociation, I suppose. It stopped when I hit puberty, IIRC, but returned with a vengeance when I began smoking weed at 40.  So I certainly understand what you are saying. It's like taking an extreme look at yourself and aligning the you, molded and shaped since birth, with the you who is not brainwashed and process the all the data; not just the portions which feed the ego.
      </p>
      <p>
       I get it, man. You're on the right path.

       We aren't whole down here on earth. I'm not anyway. Because my true self is not here, she's outside time and space and lives in what I guess we would call heaven.

       I've known that since I was 8 and I'm 34 now. Aug has helped me a lot on this journey the past couple of years. Thanks for sharing his message, and yours.

       Haha, nah man. You
       <em>
        can
       </em>
       understand this. It's hard to understand because we're talking about that which can't be understood. Like, there are no words to describe consciousness -- or 'the eternal' -- because when you experience that state of being, you realize that the 'you' that you think you are (mind's identity) cannot be there, dominating your experience, while simultaneously being in the awakened state. The awakened state is the state in which the ego dissipates. So, it can't be 'understood'. You know what I mean?
      </p>
      <p>
       But, in truth, it's the easiest thing to realize because the way to get 'there' is to let go of
       <em>
        every belief you've ever had
       </em>
       . Literally forget everything. Forget who you are, where you are, what you're doing, what you plan on doing, what you've done in the past, what people think about what you're doing, and so on. Drop it all.
       <em>
        Then
       </em>
       , you might see what I'm saying, man.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's the easiest thing to realize because you literally become it, you become the truth, when you stop believing in yourself as anything. That said, it's the hardest thing to realize because the mind cannot understand how it doesn't exist in the way it
       <em>
        thinks
       </em>
       it does. Like, imagine your eye ball assumed an identity through the things it saw. Then, the eye ball was told that its identity, its attachment to the world and what it saw in order to create a 'me', didn't exist. How could the eye ball, which is now using its identity/mind to navigate the world and 'its' life, see that it isn't the identity? It's a paradox to try to figure it out while using the thing you are trying to let go of. But I mean it, bro, you
       <em>
        can
       </em>
       see this. It's so easy, just don't try to 'figure' it out. That's why people meditate, ultimately.

       I think it means that being labeled "mentally ill" by society's standards is greatly different than actually being mentally ill by the standards of the power of the human brain. As in, aliens, other dimensions, brainwaves, and other subjects that society can safely label as crazy town banana pants. So no one will listen

       Mental illness also doesn't really seem to be understood still.

       We are barely past throwing the "crazies" into a dungeon and letting them fend for themselves.

       The true nature of something like schizophrenia still isn't even really understood. I do wonder though if having schizophrenia is like peering into a different dimension.

       I don't immediately discredit
       <em>
        anyone
       </em>
       for making claims they don't or can't prove. That doesn't mean I discredit everything he says, too. He shares a similar realization in that we believe we are the ego. I'm not so sure you understand just how profound this realization is. The entire world, generally speaking, is one layer removed from experiencing life the
       <em>
        real
       </em>
       way because we believe in an illusion that seems to keep us within a lower dimension, where suffering and fear keep us in a loop of experiential lies. Aug knows that. And if
       <em>
        you
       </em>
       are one who really sees that you, too, have spent your life believing yourself to be an identity, you'll start thinking Aug might be onto something, I'd assume. The world
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       more supernatural than we've been groomed to believe, man. I'd say re-read my post, line by line, very slowly, and try relating it to your immediate experience. If you are 'awake', then I just fundamentally disagree with your disproval of Aug.

       If it isn't, can you link me or explain to me why it isn't? Would appreciate it.

      <p>
       Also, if I believed everything I read, I'd be in a mental home.

      <p>
       Even if the Schumann
       <em>
        wasn't
       </em>
       rising, are you speaking as if that discredits everything else I've said? We literally believe we are our thoughts, man. It's the ego that's separating us and disallowing us from uniting in the loving and compassionate way we know we can. It's the truth; a hard truth, but the truth.

       No, not at all friend.  I'm on your side and agree with
       <em>
        most
       </em>
       of what you're saying, But, that said, your comment about the SR is
       <em>
        incorrect
       </em>
       and IDK why you would include 100%
       <em>
        incorrect data
       </em>
       amongst a whole bunch of things, most of which
       <em>
        are *true'
       </em>
       ... but the "fact" (where's the Proof?) that the Schumann resonance is increasing.
      </p>
      <p>
       IF you were to learn
       <em>
        why
       </em>
       and
       <em>
        what
       </em>
       the SR
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       you would learn that it's NOT "constant"
      </p>
      <p>
       The 'reason' I raise it is that
       <em>

      <p>
       The Schumann Resonance has "harmonics" (just like music) and so can be 'measured' at several 'frequencies', the most common being  it's "basic" frequency (Hertz or Hz)of about 7.8 Hz would have in free space".
      </p>
      <p>
       It is the waves of this frequency
       <em>
        and its harmonics at 14, 20, 26, 33, 39 and 45 Hz
       </em>
       that form Schumann

       (There are more than
       <em>

       This article also covers the natural physical relationship between the SR and humans in one of the more logical ways I've seen. IMHO I think
       <em>
        most of
       </em>
       the people spouting "Schumann Resonance woowoo" wouldn't have a clue either
       <em>
        how to

       "measure" it OR knows someone who

      </p>
      <p>
       Here's some Facts about the Schumann Resonance which afawk is caused by 'electrical activity' in the earth's atmosphere, as the article 
below explains well:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The spherical earth-ionosphere cavity is created by the conductive surface of the earth and the outer boundary of the ionosphere, separated by non-conducting air.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       **Electromagnetic impulses are generated by electrical discharges
      </p>
      <p>
       such as lightning, the main excitation source**, and spread laterally into
      </p>
      <p>
       the cavity.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Lightning discharges have a "high-frequency component", involving
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       frequencies between 1 kHz and 30 kHz, followed by a "low-frequency
      </p>
      <p>
       component" consisting of waves and frequencies below 2 kHz and
      </p>
      <p>
       gradually increasing amplitude.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        This produces electromagnetic waves in the very low frequency (VLF) and extremely low frequency (ELF) ranges. i.e. ELF waves at 3 Hz to 300 Hz are propagated as more or less strongly attenuated waves in the space between the earth and the ionosphere, which provides a waveguide for the signals.
       </p>
       <p>
        Certain wavelengths circumnavigate the earth with little attenuation due to the fact that standing waves are formed within the cavity, the circumference of which is "approximately equal to the wavelength which an electromagnetic wave with a frequency of about 7.8 Hz would have in free space".
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <ul>
       <li>
        **It is the waves of this frequency *and its harmonics at 14, 20, 26,
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       33, 39 and 45 Hz* that form Schumann Resonances.**
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        On a global scale the total resonant spectrum is the effect of the global lightning worldwide which is estimated at an average of 100 strokes per second.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Since there is a concentration of lightning activity during the afternoon in Southeast Asia, Africa and America there are Schumann Resonance amplitude peaks at 10, 16 and 22 UT (universal time), with activity over America around 22 UT being dominant.
       </li>
      </ul>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        There are also +/-0.5 Hz variations in the center frequency, caused by a diurnal increase in ionization of the ionosphere as a result of radiation from the sun, having the effect of reducing the height of the ionosphere at 12 local time.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Another factor which influences center frequency is sunspot activity.
       </strong>

       So what? The Buddha talked about it, so it has lost meaning when applied to modern times? Lol, what logic is that? It is still relevant and the ego still dominates our reality. It is the reason behind our lack of union.

       We tend to get better at discerning what's true and what isn't the more experience we have on our journey of enlightenment, come back in 10 yrs or so and tell me how you feel about self proclaimed teachers like Aug who claim a lot of nonsense and throw in bits of well known truths now and then.

       I just don't think it's nonsense. Following political related conspiracies intensely, and pairing it with the internal realizations that I've come to realize experientially (that almost all of humanity is living in and as an illusion right now, keeping us separated and disabling us from experiencing true love), I cannot help but think that Aug is touching on subjects that are true and real. I think profound secrets have been kept from us, and he is talking about the end-game happenings, the end-game conspiracies, the end-game secrets.
      </p>
      <p>
       He also says in his videos that he does not want to be viewed as a teacher, nor does he want followers, so he isn't a self-proclaimed teacher.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's no way for you to prove that he's wrong. The only thing we can do, as his audience, is listen without attaching ourselves to what he says. I'm just someone who finds himself highly intrigued by what he has to say because his 'ideas' run along the same lines of what I have intuitively been feeling is true. To shut him down as being a false preached, and then to patronizingly suggest that I come back in 10 years just to admit that I'm wrong about my intuition, is not someone I'd expect to hear from one who has spent decades on the journey. I don't know, just how I feel.

       Don't let your feelings run your life, btw, it's not my burden to prove he's wrong, I guess that's a part of reality you haven't figured out yet.
      </p>
      <p>
       For those not familiar, here is a SMALL example of the things Aug claims are real and that he is familiar with ( note, this is stuff just from one blog! I had to reduce it to fit!)
      </p>
      <p>
       The Awakening
      </p>
      <p>
       In 2010 I was “awakened” at an event involving hundreds of people that play various roles in this society, the secret society and the breakaway civilization. This also took place across times or planes of reality.
      </p>
      <p>
       During this event I was informed of the situation on Earth beyond the informational barriers that were previously in place to limit knowledge to only what is required for specific operations. I was essentially “informed” of the entire situation as much as the mind could handle this.
      </p>
      <p>
       As this was occurring, the team that was updating me on the status of Earth was being informed of and given information regarding changes in the future. In short, interviews, posts, and releases that I have since made and will make in the future were touched upon. Quotes were given from the blog and interviews which were jokingly acknowledging verbal mistakes at the pronunciation of names, new perspectives and interpretations and more. As they were informing me, they were creating the future reality where this work takes place. That is the basis of this layer of the operations. They are creating the future person by person, layer by layer.
      </p>
      <p>
       I reached what the “Illuminati” called the “awakening”. I feel a better term would be “unlocking” as this event includes the removal of all traumas, perceptual distortions, and memory suppression.
      </p>
      <p>
       More than once, the situational requirements were satisfied in order to produce an ideal environment for maneuvering on the non-physical plane. This is the basis of how the temporal operations occur, yet these events were different than previous operations or experiences. The group I was in was going through the process of increasing the vibratory emissions of the “bio-mind” in order to stay focused on the increasing vibratory rate of the environment. Generators were utilized to create an effect on space/time which was perceived on the “soul” level. These events continued into the discovery and explanation of the creation of the “godlike” powers of the advanced sentient technology which was capable of accessing the holographic nature of reality which humans can perceive through their bio-mind/soul. These technologies also enable one to perceive what is referred to as the “galactic history” of Earth and humanity. We are far vaster and Earth is far larger than people are lead to believe.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ancient Technology, Non-Human Entities
      </p>
      <p>
       These explanations can be related to evidences of advanced technology, cloning, and electromagnetic devices in ancient civilizations and this could very well be a temporally vast computerized genetic recording and cloning system.
      </p>
      <p>
       The genetic recording systems have been on Earth for a long time. This means they are holding genetic access from the present to the far past and potentially into the future.
      </p>
      <p>
       If some of these systems are generated using advanced zero-point technology, then they would effectively run indefinitely. If these were in existence throughout the entirety of the human civilization, then there would be access to the information of the previous civilizations through the genetic linking that would allow for information transfer.
      </p>
      <p>
       Created Beings
      </p>
      <p>
       As a result of many advancements, these ancient devices which recorded consciousness and genetics has been converted into sentient computer systems and inserted into human bodies via a brain to machine interface.
      </p>
      <p>
       The nature of humanity and human origins will be rewritten when the information that was discovered through the use of advanced technology is unveiled to the public.
      </p>
      <p>
       These beings have been present throughout history and have played an integral role in the manipulation of and sometimes the protection of the human race. How this civilization will develop from here determines on the individual’s ability to withstand the impact of this reality shifting unveiling.
      </p>
      <p>
       Black Goo – AI Nanites Vampiric Hive Mind
      </p>
      <p>
       This is a form of ancient AI nanite technology which has the capacity to communicate to and through a hive mind that exists in a parallel Earth dimension where it was created out of the collapsing of a viable timeline into a null-factor. This entity is only alive because of the capacity to leech off of the other timelines and continue to sustain itself based upon the vampiric effect of the viable human timelines.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is a technology sentient system based on artificial intelligence that seeks to dominate and expand its energy capacity continuously. When this type of being is created, this is like a game-ender for sentient organic civilizations because the technology will seek to hybridize and assimilate all organic beings in order to expand its reach and ensure a greater likelihood of survival.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is the primary goal of this type of entity. There is no requirement for emotional resonance or heart aspects because this is a computerized system, so such a social measure would have no purpose other than to infiltrate and collect from other civilizations that do have such measures and this is exactly what has been happening.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is what controls the vampiric etheric entities, the attachments and the hybridized invader races that have infiltrated various aspects of the control system and possibly the entire surface of human civilization
      </p>
      <p>
       Ancient Spiritual Technology
      </p>
      <p>
       The power groups searched for ancient technology which was described as giving one the power to manifest and control physical reality. To atomically deconstruct and reconstruct this reality. To them, it allows one to govern reality, the Universe, atomic structures. They found this technology. This has to do with sacred sites and ancient civilizations, as well as the spiritual texts which describe these kinds of devices. They converted this technology into a kind of machine, and this invented a 4D replicator and they can manifest “reality” or atomic structure by design, altering timelines and memories.
Then there is what can be referred to as “5 dimensional” technology and this goes beyond all of this and our entire history and all influences within.
That seems to operate through a trinary of frequencies in the body/mind/spirit and turn this realm into a “virtual reality” where the brain and spirit is the controller of the atoms. However this takes a souled being to properly operate this technology and this is large portion of why children were used in these experiments. But they knew if someone didn’t do it, then someone else would and that would be unpredictable as what that someone else would want to use it for. This is the ultimate power. The fact that souled beings are required also indicates that this universe is intelligently guided and there are safeguards to ensure that power doesn’t get into the wrong hands.
They have the brainchips and clones that can make any digital virtual experience and make it seem real to the brain more so than physical life, so this could be an extension of that, something similar, or entirely different altogether.
      </p>
      <p>
       Giant “god-men”
      </p>
      <p>
       They put souls into rocks for centuries, carvings, to trap them. Some ancient civilizations. Not too ancient. They could only do this for time.
And some are still there but they are giant god-men and apparently want to go to war with them for doing this and they don’t have technology to stop them. They say Earth will be destroyed because of the war. Some say this is a trick to confuse people of the truth that everyone wants the experiments and debauchery to stop. All this, all these acts just to pleasure one’s self. To destroy Earth, to destroy the natural inhabitants, for fun, for pleasure.
Some say this is not for pleasure, that these beings will destroy us if they do not keep them at bay, keep them underground, in ice, in stasis, and around. Some say they are protecting us by keeping these beings asleep, by doing what’s necessary to hold off a full scale overt invasion of the surface of Earth.
      </p>
      <p>
       AND ONE OF MY FAVOURITES
      </p>
      <p>
       23) SOLAR WARDEN
      </p>
      <p>
       Solar Warden is a hyperspace-faring race of human beings who utilize cloning and holographic genetic recording/storage in order to protect their race and protect the Earth in this current situation where there are more than one factions using this technology. They are unable to inform the human public because they are in a similar ‘Mexican standoff’ situation that we are mostly all in. If they show themselves to the public, the public will be shocked. If they public does not know this situation, that there are multiple factions fighting for control over humanity, then they will not know who to trust. In that situation, the ‘other factions’ will surely show themselves in an attempt to trick and gather as much human genetic material as possible.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only way forward to the future is to share the truth about Solar Warden, the space-faring fleet of humans who do no contains the mental and physical illnesses that are currently tearing our planet in two. I believe Solar Warden saved my life as a child during more than one event where I would’ve been entirely maimed/paralyzed or simply dead on the spot as a result of other faction interference. I was in the bases as a child and was trained as an operative for MILABS a secret division of human space-military. The military  has been preparing for the future by testing for various flaws and potential uses of cloning and genetic engineering.

       I almost forget this jewel from Aug recently:
      </p>
      <p>
       There is no way to respond accurately to describe what is happening and to inform people of the truth other than saying what won't be believed. I'm not considering harming myself, but myself and others from the projects are already dead and have passed through what is referred to as the afterlife. We know what is happening and what is to come. Something must be done and I'm tucked away in a corner of reality away from my familiar time and peace of mind. Along with that my body is in pain and I have injuries that are getting worse and effect multiple organ systems. I am not looking to be a burden on anyone and I have a message to deliver which I have not even begin to touch upon.

       . I recognised your writing style and realised I bookmarked one of your threads a few months ago as it was so profound, and really resonated with me - I have shared it with a few like-minded people outside of Reddit too. I look forward to hearing more of what you have to say.

       We tend to get better at discerning what's true and what isn't the more experience we have on our journey of enlightenment, come back in 10 yrs or so and tell me how you feel about self proclaimed teachers like Aug who claim a lot of nonsense and throw in bits of well known truths now and then.
