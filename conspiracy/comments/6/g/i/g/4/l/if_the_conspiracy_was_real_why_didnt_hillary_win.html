       Republicans enticed a very receptive and dishonest Hillary to steal the election, then they stabbed her in the back. Now, she can't even expose it because she backed herself into a corner.

       It's all pretty clear now. Donald Trump was the appointed one.

       Steve Pieczenik, a very well connected deep state guy who worked with Kissinger and many of the worst thugs claimed before the election that he was working with Julian Assange to promote a COUNTER-COUP because HRC was going to steal the election from the Deep State.
      </p>
      <p>
       In other words, the Deep State committed a COUP and blamed the other side by calling it a counter coup.

       Hillary was more popular than Trump overall. But he won due to an electoral college victory. There was no attempt to steal the election illegally (cost-benefit sucks for that).

       You see, the EVIDENCE of election cheating in the 2016 election points to Republican Donald Trump.

       The simpler answer is that the guy is lying. Announcing it is just a bizarre claim. If you are careful enough to steal the election without being noticed, you don't say you are going to do it. Or is the Deep State simultaneously brilliant and stupid?

       Watch the vids.  We had weeks of discussion over it.  You are right that he could be lying.  My impression was he was telling some truth and covering up some things.  There was amazing chatter going on as well, about certain ultra rich being attacked physically.

       We didn't know.  Counter coup info was leaking, most were skeptical, then Steve P came out with his interview confirming all.  No one ever confirmed his story, could all be Bs.  Check out the 2 Steve vids on YouTube.

       If you are like many that believe you can turn an election by looking at anticipated votes, and hack/affect only a few key areas to turn things - then yes.  If their anticipated expected votes didn't come through because (so in the bag, she doesn't need my vote).  Over enough areas, that would be significant.  I think anyways.

       A fair response. I think this is an important topic to consider when we talk about "the powers that be".
      </p>
      <p>
       How absolute are their powers really? Some theories require they practically omniscient to work, but if they still make mistakes and if they can easily be overcome by their own cockiness and the American voting system perhaps they aren't that powerful at all.

       Indeed, a great topic good enough for its own thread.  Seems no one knows.  I personally feel there are atleast a few TPTB groups vying for domination.  Once the power is consolidated, with tech as it is, I think near omniscience is possible.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the dominant force is some insanely powerful alien or AI, well, game over - and I can assume the flaws we see in their absolute power is completely feigned to lead us forward to inevitability.

       I also believe there are multiple groups vying for power. I think religion was the original consolidation of power, and I think the constant struggle over the Dome of the Rock in the Middle East is evidence that there is not currently a united force behind all of the manipulations we see.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe a totally powerful force is possible, but not necessarily inevitable. Even if one was to arise I think there will always be some chance to overthrow it, simply because you can never rule out random chance.

       He has threatened their rights as journalism. Most of the country dislikes or hates him. He is also an enormous asshole that most people believe sexually assaulted a bunch of women and bragged about it. Hell most Americans want him impeached according to polls. The republican defense of him is that he wasn't breaking the law, he was incompetent.

       He was heavily covered because he said ridiculous things and got great ratings. Many news sources thought people were just gawking at him and then he won everything. He wasn't getting negative coverage because most media outlets thought he wasn't a "serious" candidate and not worth the time. Many places issued statements saying exactly this after the national election.

       If they wanted to get rid of Donald Trump, they could have. That would have cut his support dramatically.

       Also, Republicans could have got together and forced some of the 18 clowns to drop out.

       When you think about the Republican primaries, Donald Trump the outsider was set up to win
       <em>
        absolutely

       by running so many of the usual suspects against him.

       On the coasts but here in middle America, they love the guy. They see him as a modern day Reagan.  Saying something negative about Trump around these parts is likely to get your ass kicked - even by democrats.  It's ridiculous.

       He's suggested that libel laws should be loosened so he can sue them easier. Ironically, this was in response to factual reporting that he was lying about. He's denying press access. He's bashing factual reporting, claiming its "fake news". Not inside stuff, but shit that we know is true.

       He's a danger to democracy. He has shunned all other Democratic leaders and seems to prefer dictators. They receive pretty much all of his praise. Wtf is going on with that?

       He interfered with availability by restricting briefings to only certain news outlets for purely political reasons. Monkeying with libel law so he could sue the press more easily is a clear effort to interfere with press. It would be summarily struck down by the first court that heard it
       <em>
        because it interferes.

      <p>
       His continuous whining and complaining calling factual coverage "fake news" if it reflects poorly upon him, but not when it doesn't.  While not explicitly unconstitutional, its certainly an effort to interfere with the press and the kind of behavior third world dictators do.

       Seriously, how many so-called "fake news" stories later turned out to be completely factual? Is it triple digits yet? There is

       Some do oversample some of the time, some don't. That blanket statement is categorically false. 538 has a list of polls and how they tend to oversample. There are plenty of Republican oversamples.

       You don't have to go to an aggregating website just to examine the polling data, any poll worth it's salt will include the data in the notes.  If it doesn't then you KNOW it's politicized.  Pretty much the litmus test for how deceptive they are trying to be.

       I think the animosity is for 3 reasons:
       <br/>
       1.  He's a Republican President and I think the media is harsher on Republicans than they are on Democrats (though not as much as Republicans bitch about).
       <br/>
       2.  He's repeatedly attacked the press.  He's made it their mission to fuck him up.
       <br/>
       3.  He doesn't behave like a normal President.  He draws attention to himself with the dramatic act he's putting on and says crazy shit which causes the press to, understandably, say WTF?

       Even Bush Jr. didn't get this level of media animosity and he started a war (which the media loves, btw).

       I posit that a lot of how you're treated as POTUS is what you put out there.  Twitter is not Trump's friend.  It's a goldmine of evidence to block his travel ban, determine his state of mind over Comey &amp; generally fuck up the proper narrative being given by his professional communications team.

        President Donald Trump's own national security team was reportedly blindsided after he did he did not explicitly endorse Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's founding document during his summit with NATO allies in Brussels last month.
       </p>
       <p>
        But five sources told Politico on Monday that US Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis, national security adviser H.R. McMaster, and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson worked with Trump on the speech for weeks and pushed hard for the Article 5 language to be included after viewing later drafts in which it had been taken out.

       Link to testimony? Because Trump saying stuff like "I’ve known Jeff for 15 years. Terrific guy" to the NYmag sure as hell sounds like they're friends. And mind you that quote is 15 years old now so he's known Epstein at least 30 years at this point.

       This is the one that gets me. Don't you think that sounded more like "
       <em>
        I'm on to you

       "? Think about it. I mean, if Trump and Epstein had a stolen rare jewel racket going on, do you think Trump would say, "He's a great guy. I hear he likes rare gems. The rarer the better."?? That sounds a lot more like being called out to me, like a veiled threat.

       I doubt seriously "Russia" or Wikileaks or emails had anything to do with it. Ppl in those states just hate her type.

       Hillary is just too unpopular! Couldn't beat obama 8 years ago, so she made sure she controlled the DNC this time around.... and sabotaged the election! Anyone who hates democrats should pray she sticks around for a long time.

       Seriously, a crusty old socialist is more popular... isn't it strange how similiar Bernie is to Corbyn? It's almost as if capitalism has failed.

       Because a complete and total U.S. collapse is much easier to pull off under the leadership of Trump than it would of been under Shillary.
      </p>
      <p>
       Everybody expects Trump to be a complete failure, and we are long over do for the great big depression that is soon approaching. Eight years without an MSM acknowledged recession is ludicrous. They need a scape goat plain and simple.

       I read somewhere about this being only the second time in history where a bull market has lasted beyond the typical business cycle, which is 7 years. Of course we all know that stock markets are Pinocchio driven, with elite puppet masters pulling the strings.

       But really, who the fuck knows?!? Everything's so wish-washy right now, I can barely keep a straight head with all the chaos, shenanigans , and dumbed-downed zombies I have to deal with on a day-to-day basis. Some days I find myself wishing for a giant meteor reset button!

       <p>
        President Donald Trump's own national security team was reportedly blindsided after he did he did not explicitly endorse Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's founding document during his summit with NATO allies in Brussels last month.
       </p>
       <p>
        But five sources told Politico on Monday that US Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis, national security adviser H.R. McMaster, and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson worked with Trump on the speech for weeks and pushed hard for the Article 5 language to be included after viewing later drafts in which it had been taken out.
