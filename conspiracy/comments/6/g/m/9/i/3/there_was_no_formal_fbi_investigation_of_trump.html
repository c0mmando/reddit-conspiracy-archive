       Comey and the FBI had notified dozens in Congress of this fact.    Yet the media was given free reign to constantly lie to the American people that the FBI was investigating Trump and Russia for collusion.   Meanwhile,  Comey was leaking,  and there were many other leaks,  but not this.

       The Russia/Collusion story exposes a partisan extreme.    This time its the Democrats,   but plenty of times its also the Republicans.

       Absolutely,  look up the definintion of conspire,  and Comey conspired with his college professor friend to wage a partisan attack on Trump and conspired with his former boss Lynch to drop any legal action against Hillary for her treasonous virtual leaking of classified information.

       Thanks.   The level of secrecy exerted against the people is a defining factor in the advance of democratic principles.   Its primary possibly legitimate constraint is national security against foreign threats,  but the Macheavelian principles advocate secrecy and strategies to conspire as politically justified strategies that have infected and corrupted again and again and need to be addressed.    Right now,  its legal to pay off politicians,  so the three branches of executive,  legislative and judicial are joined by the fourth branch,  a corrupt media and a fifth branch,  the corporations and there billion dollar army of lobbyists.    What you and I can find out about what is going on is not what the average American is thinking is going on.

        Comey was the top law enforcement officer in the nation before he was fired on May 9. Had he felt a special counsel was necessary to investigate possible Russian influence in the 2016 election, he could have requested one from Congress at any time. If he felt his conversations with President Trump warranted additional attention, he could have approached Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein about it.

       Yeah,  it means Comey didn't think it worth doing.   The FBI is not the one recommending it.   Congress is doing it out a partisan witch hunt based on something they claim to know that the FBI evidently is not privy to,  or has been told not to.

       Sure lets have an investigation,  but of what?    Nothing we know of so far is substantial evidence that the Russian federation had an effect on the electoral outcome,  and the efforts they made were pretty much restricted to some coverage on RT maybe.

       Not gonna be a popular opinion, but it's always been reported as an investigation of Trump's campaign/aides and Russia. I have, however, seen pretty much equal amounts of Trump supporters and non-supporters characterize it as 'Trump colluding with Russia.' One side does it because they want to believe, the other because they don't. But I don't think I've ever seen the press claim Trump himself was being investigated. What evidence is there that Comey's statements don't line up with media reporting?

       It shows the circus we call government.  I do believe there is a bigger story here.  Usually when a group that points the finger and makes loud accusations is the guilty.  That group being the establishment.  I honestly feel a group either tried to prevent or prevented a rigged election from happening.  Either way we get to witness what an unplanned and uncoordinated false flag looks like.

       are you forgetting that the primary was stolen from Bernie?    There was all kinds of rigging.   Governments all over the world were openly attacking Trump.    I am sorry Trump won,   Bernie would have beat him.   Right now to play into this circus is to sympathize with Shillary and the Trump derangement syndrome.    We know he's a crook.   We know Hillary was a crook.   We know Pence will be a crook.    What we need to do is outlaw bribery by corporations which is now guilded into law,  endorsed by the fucking Supreme Court of treasonous shills.

       No I'm not forgetting the primary which is why I believe Clinton could have or attempted to rig the election but was prevented.  I agree about keeping corporations out of elections.  You can call Trump a crook but we have a corrupt government so it takes a crook to win.  Bernie would have won popular vote but he would have lost the electoral.

       Since June/July '16 it's always been the Trump
       <em>
        campaign
       </em>
       under investigation, so don't blame the press or public if they viewed it through the prism of Trump himself, personally. Comey said a few times that he and others at the FBI didn't want to announce Trump himself wasn't under investigation cause they figured it would probably come to that, and then there'd be the need to correct.

       BS.    They should investigate the stolen primary from Bernie first.  Now that has some evidence.   I know Trump is scum but there is a Trump derangement syndrome going on,  and Hillary's stinking corrupt campaign is why she lost and her miles long trail of scandal and deep state war mongering.

       I'm not sure how anything I've said is BS, but alas. Hilldawg's penalty for the corrupt DNC was blowing an election she should have dominated, basically. The DNC should lose the court case against them, but they won't, maybe they'll actually reform and pay attention to their non-corporate constituency (but I won't hold my breath there.)

       The so called investigation of the Trump campaign is BS in light of what really caused Hillary to lose.   And fuck her,  it the country and you and me that lost.   We have to live with Trump or Pence for at least 4 years when we could have had Bernie who would have beaten Trump.   Whatever the Trump campaign did,  its nothing worse than what the Hillary campaign did,  when you think about the Clinton Foundation taking millions from foreign countries who then dictate US policy.    I doubt Trump's group was up to that level or beyond it.    So throw Trump in jail,  great,  but after Hillary is already dressed in orange.   She was first,   running her scam from her office at the Department of State,  not some gold plated mafia hangout hotel.

       Conservative messaging focused the message around Trump's out of nowhere claim he was a target of wire tapping.
      </p>
      <p>
       The actual official message has, from the beginning been on the possibility of the Trump campiaign and campaign backers working  with the Russians.
      </p>
      <p>
       The message, the nasty old government is picking on our good outsider Trump,
      </p>
      <p>
       because Trump's campaign staff and financial backers are not, anti-establishment outsiders, and exposing them would not generate the backlash against the investigations.
      </p>
      <p>
       The continual denying that Trump wasn't specifically a target was nothing but window covering to avoid discussing the real investigations.

       What do I have to do,  spell out that Trump is connected to the Russian mafia?    Of course he is as corrupt as sin.   Thats to be expected.   The Bushes,  Clinton,  Obama,  Trump,  all blood soaked in crime to the bone,  but that's not what we are talking about here.    As fucked up as the American voting system is,  and much as it was played and hacked,  Putin wasn't the deciding factor of why Hillary lost,  and I am sure that there are 10 other countries that gamed the US election more than the Russian Federation did.   Like China,  Saudi,  Germany,  Israel.    This fake news is a damn joke.    Real investigations?   Are you shitting me.   Nothing is a real investigation.    Its totally rigged.    Show me a real investigation,  ever in the last 30-60 years.   Cover ups?   Yeah,  lots of those.

       Specifically,  the FBI, in spite of Comey's obvious hostility to Trump,  did not have enough to open an investigation on Trump.    So,  all this Russia baiting BS is way overblown compared to other shit that is going down from Hillary,  Obama,  and the deep state.   Which is also a way of saying,   they want their own swamp in there,  not Trump's swamp.    It never was going to be Putin's swamp!!!!    Putin is just a handy scapegoat because he is on the deep state's shit list for helping thwart their evil and nefarious plans for Ukraine and Syria.

       No,  the US is projecting threat on eveyone else when the US is the bigger threat.    Putin,  at least as far as the Ukraine and Syria are concerned,  is more in the right than the US.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Soviet Union was already dying long before Afghanistan.   And now the US is doing its best to stab itself in the back.    Because all this partisan talk,  like the Soviet talk,  is just too many degrees removed from reality.

       when did Comey first have reason to go after Flynn?    Comey was trying to save the Hillary campaign in October.    Yeah,  the democrats were furious with him,  but essentially he let Hillary off with a light hand slap.    The part the democrats didn't like was that Comey was trying to save his own ass from being complicit in her crimes.    Saying she was off the hook when the Weiner laptop had been looked at by the NY office was just not possible,  not even for Comey.    After all,  look,  he has been in a position up to being fired where he could still serve Hillary and Obama.

       You are just muddling up the conservation with your opinion.
      </p>
      <p>
       You don't  mention why it took the FBI so long to get the Wiener laptop from NY Police?
      </p>
      <p>
       Here is what the FBI knew about the Trump/Campaign and Russia before October.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        July 8
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Carter Page, who is now on Trump's campaign team and who the FBI is investigating for potentially being a Russian spy (more on that later), gives a speech in Moscow where he says the US should be a little more friendly with Russia. He says he was there as a private citizen, not as a member of the Trump campaign.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        July 18
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       The Republican National Convention aka the GOP's Coachella kicks off in Cleveland. Kislyak, the Russian ambassador to the US, makes a cameo appearance. And meets with a few Trump campaign officials, including Page and Jeff Sessions. PS: schmoozing with political officials is basically an ambassador's job description, so meetings like this aren’t necessarily unusual.
      </p>
      <p>
       But during this convention, Team Trump convinces the GOP to roll back its policies toward helping Ukraine -- a longtime US ally -- fight a pro-Russia separatist movement in the country. This is pretty much the only party platform issue the Trump campaign weighs in on.
       <strong>
        August
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Secret handwritten docs are found in Ukraine, showing Manafort was paid by the pro-Russian Ukrainian political party that ended up winning the presidential election there. It’s unclear if the docs are legit and if Manafort actually received that money. Investigators in Ukraine say the docs are part of their investigation into the party's illegal activities. A few days later, Manafort resigns as Trump's campaign manager.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        September
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Kislyak meets with then-senator Sessions at his office on Capitol Hill. Sessions later says this meeting was just a coffee date and not related to the Trump campaign. And that it wasn’t unusual for him to meet with ambassadors in his role on the Senate Armed Services Committee. The Washington Post later asks all 26 members of the committee whether they also ever met with Kislyak in 2016. The 20 who respond say 'nope.'
       <strong>
        October
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Less than two weeks to go until Election Day, Comey decides to send Congress a postcard saying the FBI is reviewing new evidence related to its investigation into Clinton's private email server. Thanks Anthony Weiner.

       In other words,  an innuendo witch hunt is all you got.    Compare that to what they have as PROOF of what Hillary and Huma did.   You gonna blame that on Weiner?    Come on man,  the buck stops on Hillary,  not Weiner.   Weiner just was a convenient scapegoat who needed a bargaining chip.

       "Ukraine" was always part of Russia and so was Georgia for much of the time.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also,  Syria has been a Russian ally for ages.   So,  you come across as an uneducated war hawk talking about "let them eat Europe" when they have always been invaded from Europe by Napoleon and Hitler costing over 6 million lives.
      </p>

       Americans are 1 in 20 humans,  and America could have been a good neighbor and not killed 2 million in Vietnam for nothing and nearly as many in the Middle East for nothing.   America is the one who needlessly used nuclear bombs against innocent civilians in Japan and started the cold war.   Yes,  the Soviet Union used to tinker around here and there,  but nothing compared to the US.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its like the US calling Iran belligerent when they haven't started a war in over 200 years.
      </p>
      <p>
       Russia, China,  India,  Brazil,  Indonesia,  Nigeria,   in the long run,  they are going to rise relative to the US.    What do you think this is a game of Risk?    How is it going to turn out?    At the current rate,  a smoldering dead planet,  burned out by nuclear weapons.   But if we are lucky,   both the US and Russia will gradually become a lot more like Scandanavia or Switzerland.    But people like you need to stop making up lies to justify military supremacy.   Its overly paranoid.   The US would be a lot stronger if we fixed a lot of stuff we have been postponing.    Also the economic and political model needs some tweeking or its also on the path of self destruction.   It won't be Russia that takes us down,  but ourselves.

       A real patriot questions the actions of the dictators who have taken over.   What you are talking about is fanatical nationalism.   In my book its unpatriotic to support the war criminals who sit at the top of the US.    I feel I need to take a shower after talking to you.    Have you no decency?    Did you not hear about all the torture,  have you no idea of what has been done in our name?

       The differences between Bush Jr and Obama are very minor in my book,  policy wise,  so the suicide rate is something they are both sharing in,  but my point was,  its obviously something that happened to those guys or something they saw that pushed them over to suicide.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't see the difference between an innocent American life and an innocent Libyan,  Syrian,  Iraqi, whatever life,  personally.    I am not ok with using war as we have in the Middle East,  in Vietnam or in Hiroshima or Nagasaki.    I mean when Russia did something similar in Afghanistan,  that was BS,  right?   If Russia did that to Poles or Hungarians,  that would be BS,  right?   So why is it ok when we do it?    It turns out it wasn't for self defense,  not at all!   And its barbaric on a scale that is hard to imagine.   Hence the suicides.

       The video was Hillary cackling over her "great success" in Libya which was a war crime for which she and her boss should face a tribunal.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know who you are,  what you are about but it is alarming to see us demonizing the Russians when they are not on our borders or any Nato member borders doing what we are doing on their borders.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Russia hate is based on misinformation and propaganda on the scale of the so called weapons of mass destruction that Saddam did not have.

       I don't get it how Americans are so easy to sway to useless war.

       I was a kid in Moscow when Khruschev said that.    There's a lot more bs where that came from.   And the US said the same shit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its time to grow up and get real here,  stop the propaganda crap.   At least Russia has to admit it was full of shit in its Soviet days.    The US is still years away from admitting that its been full of shit and on a global murder spree based on lies and myths.
