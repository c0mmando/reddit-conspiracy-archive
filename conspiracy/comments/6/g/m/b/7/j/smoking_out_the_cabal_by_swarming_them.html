        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I thought by now Trump would have drained the swamp. Why he hasn&#39;t is irrevelant because we don&#39;t need anyone but ourselves since we are about 7 billion strong worldwide and almost every country on earth has become corrupted so we all have to participate. </p>

<p>The strategy would be nonstop swarming in 4 ways: </p>

<ol>
<li>Unemployed citizens (or people with time) need to just hang around government building and put on a show which will be live streamed. For example, we can use a thousand people around Langley, a thousand around the whitehouse, and for those too far from any major government building, you can hang around the local city hall. </li>
</ol>

<p>All we need is a steady stream and conspiracy subs can be used for recruiting or livestreaming. Also, this is a perfect way to get some exercise while saving the world. </p>

<ol>
<li>We need to constantly bombard the phones of known cabal members like John McCain or Lindsey graham. All phone numbers and addresses of these cabal members are public information and on google search. </li>
</ol>

<p>A lot of people cold called during the election to get more votes for a particular candidate. We can do the same and have some fun with it by calling and demanding that the swamp be drained. IE we call McCain and demand he is removed from office a few times a day. We can do this with anyone but it needs to become a habit. People can even record it and upload to YouTube for entertainment and advertising dollars but most importantly, to add as much pressure as we can to push out the cabal from office. </p>

<ol>
<li><p>If any of these cucks are spotted in public, we need to treat them how we treated the Clintons in public and hopefully record the incident to upload to YouTube later. A general strategy here is to humiliate them live on camera just like we did with Bill Clinton when we yelled &quot;Bill Clinton is a rapist!&quot;. Bill and Hillary are done partially for this reason. I can&#39;t see them working any other public jobs. We literally marked them as rapists who dodged justice and are walking around as free criminals. The people would be beyond outraged if HRC or Bill took a position in office and the cabal knows it. We basically handicapped them. </p></li>
<li><p>We need to swarm their mailboxes, email inboxes, and the White House petitions with endless demands that these cabal members disappear. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>All of this equates to jabs, hooks, and uppercuts by the citizens of the world. If this strategy goes viral, all of the effort will add up quick and the cabal will be eating our fists 24/7/365. Even if everyone puts in 5 minutes of effort every day, we will succeed in the long run. </p>

<p>The problem is that things are only going to get worst just as the cabal planned it. Look what they are doing to the English citizens or Venezuela. They WILL do anything to abuse the people for profit as long as they think they can get away with it. The reason America isn&#39;t totally destroyed is because the cabal moves slow and steady for safety reasons but at this rate we are navigating towards a planetary meltdown where suffering and violence exists at every corner. They don&#39;t give a shit if you have kids. If turning your desperate kids into street hookers and druggies means they can increase their income from $1,000,000,000 a year to $1,000,000,100 a year, they will happily make it happen. They are simply psychopaths with no morale conscience whatsoever and they are always looking to profit from your misery. </p>

<p>We are our of time folks. It&#39;s really that simple. Why should we wait until more suffering happens before we make our move like Venezuela did? Venezuelans waited until food and toilet paper ran out before swarming the government. I&#39;m proud that they are on the move but I wish they had done it earlier like the South Koreans or the icelanders in order to avoid years of suffering. </p>

<p>The best time is almost always now. Even Assange is mistaken about slowly leaking government crimes. It&#39;s best to leak now so it will all hit at the same time and cause outrage. A slow drip may shock the population but they often forget old crimes when new crimes show up every so often. A mega dump would cause enough outrage and motivation to trigger a massive move. </p>

<p>Why do we solely rely on people like Assange? Why don&#39;t we take the chance once and for all? Just look around you. What can you do to swarm the cabal? (Tip: All this can be done peacefully and should be done peacefully. We don&#39;t need to return evil with evil and we don&#39;t want to be in jail.)</p>

<p>For those swarming buildings, here is a good tool set:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Actual pitchforks. These pitchforks hold a lot of meaning and when people see citizens on YouTube with pitchforks, they will know the meaning behind them. It is a statement of rebelling against the evil cabal. </p></li>
<li><p>Loudspeakers to use for communication. </p></li>
<li><p>Signs. These can be easily made by anyone. </p></li>
<li><p>Cell phones.</p></li>
<li><p>We can even bring olive branches to hand out to the local cops. Handing them an olive branch is a nice offer for them to join us in our peaceful demonstrations because many of them want to but are afraid. This will help ease the transition so that we have police on our side. If they don&#39;t physically take the olive branch, just throw it into the crowd of police. The message will be sent one way or another. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>We need to raise hell peacefully. There is no choice and there is no point in sitting back and watching the cabal flames burn our planet to a crisp because they will never stop unless we stop them. </p>

<p>The best time to do this is always NOW. It&#39;s  like a messy room. Either clean it now or watch it get messier and messier. </p>

<p>One thing I can assure is that white hat politicians will be able to use our swarming strategy as a stepping stone to further our cause. We can work in step with our white hat insiders but we all need to participate. </p>

<p>Also, this isn&#39;t volunteer work. This is business because once we get the corruption out by draining the swamp, all of our qualities of life will drastically increase not only because of the obvious reasons but also because the cabal is hiding oceans of resources, 50-100 years worth of technology, and other informational resources that would greatly benefit mankind. Once we sort them out, we can sort out these hidden treasures so that they benefit mankind which they will and so all of our hard work will eventually pay off big league. Most of us will taste true freedom for the first time in our entire life and when we do, we will think back and say: &quot;It was all worth it&quot; because it really is unarguably worth it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That ship is sinking fast. Come back to our side where you are secure. You can really help us as an insider to the bank. I assure you, the cabal is toast. Once they really get desperate, they will start throwing their own minions under the bus to save themselves. When you see how pretty the world will be when the cabal is gone, you will better understand why everyone&#39;s gain is your gain and everyone&#39;s loss is your loss. Of course, you have free will to do what you like. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I get what you&#39;re saying but a large issue we are encountering right now is exactly who is a white hat and who is not according to who/whom. </p>

<p>There&#39;s a deep divide in the U.S.A partly because of our conditioning. We have been conditioned to root for one sport team to win regardless of shitty referee calls. </p>

<p>Another problem we encounter is this is commie propaganda whether you think so or not. And we would have to all rally behind a cult of personality. Which is what they do. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>One thing I can sure you is that white hat politicians will be able to use our swarming strategy as a stepping stone to further our cause. We can work in step with our white hat insiders but we all need to participate.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It could also be used for another person to come in and take absolute power under the trust of gulaging all people seen as damaging to the country. I always thought it was funny when people associate communism with globalism. Commieism is the ultimate nationalist movement. Because after the mob executes the politicians who is going to be in power and for how long?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We have to stop thinking things staticly and start thinking dynamically. All that matters is what&#39;s happening right now. We can&#39;t hold everything everyone has done against them if they are NOW whole heatedly wanting to help us. A lot of politicians are pretending to help us and some are afraid to help us. We need to really think and figure out who is who but first, we need to exercise our power as a planet. We need to go in there and show them who&#39;s boss and once we are in, we need to look at the evidence they have been hiding from us. That evidence will tell us a lot about a lot of politicians. Once we determine who is who, we will handle it accordingly. </p>

<p>Right now the boss (the citizens of the world) is crying because his employees are fucking up his business and stealing from it. If the boss doesn&#39;t grab his balls, go in there, and fire all the crooks, who&#39;s to blame except the boss?</p>

And when you add up all of the conspiracies, like JFK, 9/11, fluoride in the water, assassinations of dissenters, etc, the dots start to connect. Are you looking for a smoking gun? Have you looked into any of these conspiracies? Or are you dead set on arguing whether or not a cabal exists? Like I said earlier, look into secret societies and mystery babylon.

<p>9/11. I&#39;m 100% convinced this was a false flag. The evidence is overwhelming. I realized this is the work of many, many people. The only way for that many people to pull off such an evil act, they have to be part of a secret society. The amount of planning that had to be done to pull this off, all the while covering their tracks, is astronomical. </p>

<p>Then I went backwards from there to JFK. His assassination is the point where the cabal really got their grips into the US government. George HW Bush pulled off the hit, and was rewarded greatly for it. Going back even further, Bush&#39;s father and grandfather funded Hitler and the Nazis. Again, overwhelming evidence if you look at all the circumstances surrounding all of this conspiracies. </p>

This also led to the patriot act, where the government spies on its own people and feeds them propaganda via media and subliminal messaging. Insider trading the day before 9/11. Building 7 collapsing, even though a plane never hit it. Look into what companies occupied building 7 as well. Next you have a the missile that hit the pentagon and destroyed the accounting office, where all the paperwork was for the trillions that were lost. It goes on and on my friend. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The proof is in the pudding.  You have to look past the partisan charade and see what interests and powers are consistently left alone and allowed to grow.  There&#39;s not just going to be a xerox of the Cabal&#39;s declaration of mass enslavement floating around for us to link to you.  </p>

<p>I&#39;d recommend starting with &quot;The Creature from Jekyll Island&quot; for the banking side of things, and &quot;Killing Hope&quot; for the military arm that serves those banking interests.  The first of those covers the usurpation of the American dollar through the creation of the privatized Federal Reserve in 1913 (see also: Andrew Jackson&#39;s battle against the central bankers in the previous century.)  The second follows CIA regime change since WWII and how various puppet governments were set up to serve their global interests.  Also highly relevant, Smedley Butler&#39;s &quot;War is a Racket.&quot;  He was propositioned by early cabal members to lead a fascist military coup to overthrow the US government in the 30&#39;s.  He went along long enough to gather enough information before reporting the conspiracy to congress.  The whole thing was basically swept under the rug. </p>

<p>After reading all of those, watch &quot;JFK to 9-11: Everything is a Rich Man&#39;s Trick&quot; and see if you can&#39;t see the big picture.  Enjoy!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As I said, the proof is in the pudding.  If you&#39;re not even willing to do the work of opening your mind to new information because it&#39;s &quot;vague and biased media&quot;, then I have doubts you would even accept hard proof if it were presented to you.  </p>

<p>I&#39;ve given you more to go on than OP, by the looks of it.  How about you just give those readings a chance and make up your mind after reading them?  Is it really such a risk to consider something?</p>

<p>The thing is, many people here would point to the existence of the Bilderberg group as sufficient proof that we are ruled by a select group of elite.  But until <em>you personally</em> do the work of thinking critically about the prevailing narrative, then nothing will convince you.  Again, for harder proof, there have been some official FBI memos mentioning the 7th floor group, I believe in relation to the Clinton email/Foundation probes.  You can start there if you&#39;re looking for some legitimate evidence of deepstate infrastructure.</p>

We can shake the foundations of this planet through assertive, strategic hell raising without hurting a single person in the process.

Currently, while many people are definitely waking up, and the elite are absolutely panicked over it, currently there still is not enough of a waking of consciousness to rally enough people to fill the streets. Just look at countries like brazil or Spain where when minor grievances turn out Millions in the streets, but in the USA- nothing, nada, zip. People are still too comfortable to take a chance to give up what they have which is why while the Illuminati do bear the ultimate responsibility, much of that blame can be put squarely on the shoulders of the populace for allowing it to happen.

    <div class="md"><p>I understand your position and am not really disagreeing with you as such. Just relaying the reality that I have been speaking of these issues for 20 years and I can assure you people are willfully, stubbornly ignorant because they simply don&#39;t want to know the truth... and that will remain until they feel the pain... which is coming like a train hurtling down the tracks because the Illuminati are panicked the ppl are waking up so they know their window to fully bring in the New World Order is closing. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>We rely on people like Assange because he is effective. He has ideas similar to yours, but instead of posting on reddit, he made a global system involved with lawyers, politicians, and security experts to accomplish it.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a difference between rulers and leaders. If you want to accomplish your goals an not rely on people like Assange, than you need to lead. However, you need to be ready to spend years locked in an embassy or shot dead by a patsy.</p>

<p>Knowing this, how much do you want to go past your reddit post?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We need every man on deck including Assange. I&#39;m not saying we should replace Assange. I am saying we should help assange because have so much power to do so. We are already slaves to the cabal. What more is there to lose? There is everything to gain. They can&#39;t arrest 7 billion angry citizens. There are too many of us. We don&#39;t even need a leader. We only need group leaders and a group can be as small as 3 people. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Leaders are the ones who go first. Anytime any one of us do something that needs to be done at the moment, we are leading. </p>

<p>If you look at the ants, they are always taking initiative so they are all very much leaders. I can easily lead people near me but I am not in touch with the whole world. We are all together in touch with everyone which means every one of our many groups needs a leader. Anyone should be able to jump in our our or leadership position at anytime so leadership will change up often and everyone will have an opportunity to lead I feel they deem it best to do so in their respective groups. </p>

<p>That being said, all the motivated citizens around the world need to lead and do all they can do. When tons of groups are all doing a little bit of work, it all adds up. We are already doing this now but we need to increase in speed. I only say this because we are having a full blown worldwide emergency of epic proportions which is what the cabal always wanted. The only bridge we have to cross now is to motivate our angriest citizens to do something other than complain. Many of our minority groups have eaten the most shit but there are plenty of angry whites on hand too. All these frustrated, often unemployed people can put that spare time to use. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;ve got me wrong, man. I don&#39;t resort to ad hominem. Im definitely not cognitively biased, I&#39;m actually a pretty skeptical person, like you. However, from everything I&#39;ve read and studied, there is definitely a cabal/deepstate. David Rockefeller admitted it in his own book. Henry Kissinger did as well.  And when you add up all of the conspiracies, like JFK, 9/11, fluoride in the water, assassinations of dissenters, etc, the dots start to connect. Are you looking for a smoking gun? Have you looked into any of these conspiracies? Or are you dead set on arguing whether or not a cabal exists? Like I said earlier, look into secret societies and mystery babylon. I&#39;m not spoon feeding you this stuff, you have to look into it yourself. </p>
