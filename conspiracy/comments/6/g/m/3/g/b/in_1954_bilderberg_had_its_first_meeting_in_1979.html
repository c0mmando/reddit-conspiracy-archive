<p>I try to stay out of 9/11 discussions, there&#39;s misinformation on both sides. From the official side, It took 400 days for Bush to even begin an investigation, which I feel was a disservice to the country, and the NIST report didn&#39;t seem to adequately cover the building 7 collapse. On the other hand, the conspiracy side has its own flaws as well, for example Alex Jones made a name for himself as a 9/11 &#39;truther&#39;, and now he&#39;s a complete joke. There are also tons of 9/11 documentaries that spread conjecture posing as solid facts, to me that&#39;s just as bad as the official narrative being misleading.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Holy shit, I&#39;m sick of having to explain 911 to people, especially here on r/conspiracy every fucking day. u/mastgia what&#39;s happening to the sub?? </p>

<p>Yes I <em>actually</em> believe that because it <em>is</em> true. I&#39;m sorry that&#39;s such a wildly preposterous idea to you, but facts are facts. Physics is physics. Wtc7 can&#39;t just disappear in under a minute due to an office fire not even visible on the outside. That&#39;s <em>not physically possible</em> no matter how hot the fire supposedly got. Jet fuel alone <em>cannot chemically</em> get hot enough to even melt a tiny bit of steel. An office fire can&#39;t melt steel. But guess what? Thermite can! And thermite is used in controlled demolitions! And thermite was found at ground zero! So how can it <em>not</em> be controlled demolition???</p>

<p>Do you really believe the supposed hijacker&#39;s passport could have magically been found unharmed on the fucking street? Sorry if the cognitive dissonance is too strong for you, but <strong>yes, your own federal government and intelligence agencies orchestrated a false flag terror attack, killing thousands of innocent Americans, and poisoning thousands more in the process, all in order to justify a war on terror that would also kill millions more innocent people.</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ahh Mr Snowmandan I have read many of your works especially about Julian assange back in December. The 911 argument at this point is stupid since only the ignorant ones are left who buy the original story and they are too dumb to even redpill. What I am saying about this Bildeberg document though is why the hell would they release it even 30 yrs after it happened and expect no repurcussions? I just dont believe a secret society would be so open to discuss and record their main objectives. </p>

<p>I still feel that the narrative we are following is a result of a significantly large population of wealthy individuals making choices that greatly benefit themselves and not anyone else. Those with money have the luxury of doing so, and thus their goal is in common with all other rich peoples. These ploys can easily just be the side product of allowing citizens to become rich. We never had private sectors in the middle ages and I am pretty sure the only wealthy humans back then were royalty and their relatives (barons, lords, w.e. they are called). Humanity is dealing with a relatively new social system, capitalism, which was implemented with the idea that anyone has the chance to make it big, but also allowing wealth to accumulate at a single point. I dont think the people who began this had any idea what would become of it, it just seemed like the best thing to do at that time.</p>

<p>The whole world kind of fucked itself because the founding fathers may have decided to omit the fact that capitalism requires exponential growth while we are living on a finite planet. Could that have been intentional? Yes very likely. I too would be for a system that I knew would keep myself and my family for the next 4 generations super wealthy. But I dont think anyone is capable of predicting the exact moves people will be forced to take in the next 100 or even 50 years. </p>

<p>To me, the letter in the link could easily have been edited to make it seem evil and sinister because more people will want to read it. That reaults in higher traffic which today equals more money for the content creator. At the end of the day everyone is just greedy, and that is a result of capitalism that was likely overlooked. Noone in the 1800&#39;s could have accurately conceived what has become of the internet today. </p>

<p>End of rant. I just dont see a secret society openly allowing their documents into the web even if they are old. I do believe they are up to something, but probably not the exact way this document states it. I would guard information like that with my life. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your point is well taken, but you must also remember that one of the cabal&#39;s MOs is leaving evidence of their wrongdoing or occult beliefs in plain sight. Might be because Lucifer or one of the Egyptian gods they worship demands it of them, or perhaps they just enjoy openly mocking us. In either case they have the benefit of plausible deniability, since as you noted, it would be fairly easy to fabricate a document such as this. Like all evidence of this nature, take it with a grain of salt. There&#39;s far too much mis- and disinformation out there to take something like this as 100% truth.</p>

<p>Serious question; how much have you <em>actually</em> researched 9/11? How much have you actually looked into how the world has changed since? Have you ever actually watched a 9/11 documentary? Can you explain the trillions that went missing the day before? How about the vaults at all 3 buildings which collapsed being emptied beforehand? </p>

<p>I&#39;m stealing this list from another post, but look at all this, and then tell me 9/11 wasn&#39;t a false flag. Seriously dude, wake the fuck up. I mean, if you hold the stance you do because you are ill informed, that&#39;s one thing. But if you&#39;ve seen all the evidence and still deny it, then it seems <strong>you</strong> are the one who has lost the ability to be objective, no? </p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6gbr6b/without_911/">The following was taken from this post;</a></p>

<p><em>Without 9/11 there would be no &quot;war on terror&quot;.</em></p>

<p><em>Without 9/11 there would be no &quot;clash of civilizations&quot;</em></p>

<p><em>Without 9/11 there would be no war in Afghanistan.</em></p>

<p><em>Without 9/11 there would be no war in Iraq.</em></p>

<p><em>Without 9/11 there would be no war in… (insert any country classified as part of the &quot;axis of evil&quot; or defined as being &#39;with the terrorists&#39;)</em></p>

<p><em>Without 9/11 thousands of U.S. troops would not have been sent to their deaths.</em></p>

<p><sup>Without</sup> 9/11 hundreds of thousands of citizens of Iraq and Afghanistan would not have been sentenced to their deaths.*</p>

<p><em>Without 9/11 there would be no inaction on the Israeli-Palestinian peace process.</em></p>

<p><em>Without 9/11 there would be no civilian contractors in Iraq and the scandal that has followed them would have been averted.</em></p>

<p><sup>Without</sup> 9/11 there would be no false military reporting (Pat Tillman, Jessica Lynch), and no crack down on the freedom of the press (banning photographing the returning coffins).*</p>

<p><em>Without 9/11 there would be no Patriot Act.</em></p>

<p><em>Without 9/11 there would be no NSA warrant-less wiretapping program.</em></p>

<p><em>Without 9/11 there would be no Camp Delta and no Camp X-ray at Guantanamo Bay.</em></p>

<p><em>Without 9/11 there would be no Military Commissions Act and no coordinated program of extraordinary rendition, indefinite detention and torture of those defined as “enemy combatants”.</em></p>

<p><em>Without 9/11 there would be no vast increase in secrecy and complete militarization of intelligence under the newly created office of the Director of National Intelligence.</em></p>

<p><em>Without 9/11 there would not be thousands of dead and dying emergency workers who are suffering crippling and fatal respiratory illnesses.</em></p>

<p><em>Without 9/11 there would be no vast increase in military and security spending that goes arm in arm with huge cutbacks in other key social programs (such as levees in New Orleans).</em></p>

<p><em>Without 9/11 there would have been no total abandonment of fiscal restraint, which has contributed to plunging the nation into an abyss of debt and looks likely to tip the world into a deep recession if not a complete depression.</em></p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>How is it total nonsense?</p>

<p>Because an economy simply does not obey the laws of electrodynamics.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It&#39;s a good analogy.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>By all means then, go invest your savings as according to the laws which govern electricity.<br/>
Just don&#39;t be surprised when people don&#39;t actually hand over their wealth in accordance with the laws of electromagnetism, or when voltage (output demand) doesn&#39;t actually increase in accordance in proportion of the charge (1939 dollars) you feed into this <a href="https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/imagenes_sociopol/cooper2_07a.gif">amplifier circuit</a> of his, because in reality there&#39;s no such thing as an economic equivalent to a <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9f/Not-gate-en.svg/500px-Not-gate-en.svg.png">NOT gate</a> or the voltage logic levels they exist to invert in the provided diagram. </p>

<p>It&#39;s easy to take the definitions of terms like charge, current, volts, etc, and simply change the units they deal with (coulombs into dollars, seconds into years, etc). So long as the units you&#39;re replacing are equivalent (for example; seconds, minutes, years, decades, they&#39;re all ultimately measurements of time) then the system you create is still going to have internal logical consistency as it did before. Watch, I&#39;ll make one right now:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Charge: coulombs - Flamingos.<br/>
Flow/Current: amperes (coulombs per second) - Flamingos eaten per month.<br/>
Motivating Force: volts - Hungry crocodiles.<br/>
Conductance: amperes per volt - Flamingos eaten per month per hungry crocodile.<br/>
Capacitance: coulombs per volt - Flamingo population per hungry crocodile.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Internally, that makes perfect sense. But, just like with economics, it falls apart if you try to apply the system to the real world. You can make a system about literally anything you want, it&#39;s making one which accurate models reality that&#39;s the hard part.</p>

<p>I understand you want to highlight the absurdity here with a <em>bad</em> analogy.</p>

<p>Thank you for taking the time, though!

    <div class="md"><p>This is how I would phrase it.</p>

<p>When the Federal Government starting cutting education in the early 80&#39;s it signaled the beginning of socialism creeping into the system. Showing that there is no difference between parties, the Federalization continued under the next Republican, Democrat, Republican and Democrat Administrations.</p>

<p>There is a war on, that war is against the people The &quot;America&#39;s Next Top President&quot; reality show is a distraction just like indulgences in the middle ages. </p>

<p>Or.... You can single out one Administration making it sound like it was a political thing, like you did. If that was not your point learn to write more clearly. </p>

<p>That&#39;s without even further delving into the concept of being forced into too many work hours than to give someone reasonable time to maintain properly informed or to further themselves in either education or personal advancement in other ways.</p>

<p>Nor was that even going into the educational standards and the allocation of money spent on educational programs and teachers vs waste.</p>

<p>But to simplify:</p>

<p>What does higher education <em>not</em> have to do with this? Education is literally the center of this subject. </p>

<p>The graph you show only shows K-12, it doesn&#39;t factor in post high school. So it&#39;s essentially cherry picking stats when I&#39;m talking about education as a whole. </p>

<p>For the third time:</p>

<p>Are you having difficulty with that sentence? You understand what post-high school means after K-12, yes? </p>

<p>It certainly points in that direction more than the opposite. When all your peers are spending more on education than you are, then that&#39;s a problem. </p>

This is how Youtube introduced censorship, it&#39;s not based on regulation, it&#39;s based on the delicate sensibilities of their advertisers:</p>

<p>It is critical that the title 2 regulation stays in place and keeps the internet free and open.</p>

<p>Not all regulation is bad, you don&#39;t want poisoned food right? Whoever tells you that all regulation is bad is lying to you.</p>

<p>I think this is going away more and more, but that is another conversation.</p>

<p>I agree with this, but I think we still need to stop companies like comcast from having monopolies in markets. This could kill two birds with one stone.</p>

<p>with no monopoly: Comcast blocks netflix? move to another isp like the dial up days. Also the prices for fast internet would be competitive. Plus competition would drive better service/innovation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Comcast did block Netflix when the title 2 provision was not in place. That&#39;s not even hypothetical, it already happened.</p>

<p><a href="http://money.cnn.com/2014/08/29/technology/netflix-comcast/index.html">http://money.cnn.com/2014/08/29/technology/netflix-comcast/index.html</a></p>

<p>That is exactly why the law must not change. Comcast has already shown that they can and will harm their competitors by slowing them down and demanding a ransom. The snakes in the FCC try to spin this as a &#39;free market will regulate itself&#39; argument, this simply is not true. In other countries, like Malaysia, tiered service packages are already a thing, and it is a terrible system for subscribers. </p>

<p>Comcast/Time warner is already a massive monopoly, they need to be broken up like Bell Telecom was:</p>

<p><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakup_of_the_Bell_System">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakup_of_the_Bell_System</a></p>

<p>If title 2 gets removed and regulatory power handed over the FTC it will be a disaster on all kinds of levels.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They are trying to switch the regulatory body from the FCC (Federal Communications Commission) which treats internet as a public utility, to the FTC (Federal Trade Commission). If regulatory power ends up in the hands of the FTC it will be much easier for companies like Comcast to limit free speech. The internet will begin to look more like cable television, customers will have to pay higher prices for faster service and access to more sites (like cable already does with premium channels, for example a basic package will give you Facedbook, and to get Reddit you have to pay extra) smaller sites will have their data speeds throttled because they won&#39;t be able to pay Comcast a ramsom for higher speed, and censorship will continue to get worse and more efficient.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Check this out, sound familiar? <a href="http://tavistockagenda.iwarp.com/whats_new_31.html">Tavistock and &quot;Operation Research&quot;</a> </p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;low-class element of society must be brought under total control, trained and assigned to duties at an early age, which can be accomplished by the quality of education, which must be the poorest of the poor. The lower-classes must be trained to accept their position, long before they have an opportunity to query it.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Technically, children must be &#39;orphaned&#39; in day care centers under government control. With such an initial handicap, the lower-classes will have little hope of upward mobility away from their assigned positions in life. The form of slavery we have in mind is essential for good social order, peace and tranquility. </p>

<p>&quot;We have the resources to attack the vitality, options and mobility of the individuals in society by knowing through our social scientist, understanding and manipulating and attacking their sources of social energy (income), and therefore, their physical, mental and emotional strengths and weaknesses. The general public refuses to improve its own mentality. It has become a herd of proliferating barbarians, and a blight on the face of the earth. </p>

<p>&quot;By measuring the economic habits by which the sheep try to run from their problems and escape from reality via the medium of &#39;entertainment&#39;, it is absolutely possible, applying Operation Research methods, to predict the probable combination shocks (created events) which are necessary to bring about complete control and subjugation of the population by subverting the economy. The strategy includes the use of amplifiers (advertising), and when we speak on television in the manner that a ten year old can relate to, then because of the suggestions made, that person will purchase that production impulse, the next time he comes across it in a store. </p>

<p>&quot;The balance of power will provide the stability that the world of the 21st century is likely to achieve, rent as it will be, by passionate tribalism and by such seemingly insoluble issues like that posed by mass migration from the South to the North, and from farm to city. There may be mass transfers of population, such as those between Greece and Turkey in the aftermath of the First World War; really mass murders. It will be a time of troubles, in need of a unifier; an Alexander or Mohammed. </p>

<p>&quot;A great change that will come about as a result of emerging conflicts between peoples who live side by side — and which will, by their intensity, take primacy over their other conflicts — is that political rivalry will be within regions, rather than between them. This will bring about a turning back from global politics. After a decade in which the U.S. and the Soviet Union dueled across oceans, the powers will focus on protecting themselves against forces on their frontiers — or within them. </p>

<p>&quot;The American people do not know economic science and care little about it, hence, they are always ripe for war. They cannot avoid war, notwithstanding their religious morality, nor can they find in religion the solution to their earthly problems. They are knocked out of shape by economic experts who cause Shockwaves that wreck budgets and buying habits. The American public is yet to realize that we control their buying habits.&quot;</p>
