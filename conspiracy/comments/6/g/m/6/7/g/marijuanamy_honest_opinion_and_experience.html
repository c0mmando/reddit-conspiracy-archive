        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I recently made some changes in my life which included quitting smoking, both pot and tobacco. I&#39;ve been addicted since 2013 to both and never spent more than a few days off of weed and a month or two off tobacco. I&#39;m a month in off both and want to talk about some of the hype about pot I&#39;ve heard over my life.
First I&#39;ve been told it&#39;s not addictive. It may not cause physical withdrawals but laying in bed for a few hours not being able to sleep and constantly thinking &quot;just one bowl and I could pass out&quot; was tougher than the physical withdrawals I had for tobacco. The time aspect, when boredom sets in all I could think about was smoking a bowl and letting time take care of itself while I sink into the couch. School work, I&#39;m so much more focused and can study late into the night when previously all productivity stopped for me after 4pm. In all honesty it&#39;s a nice drug that can be used for medication but the stigma around colleges is completely false and everyone I try to talk about this with says I&#39;m wrong, unless they&#39;ve recently taken it out of their lives. I really do believe marijuana is the ultimate inequality inducer. It destroys all potential for progression in one&#39;s life and alters your train of thought to be so enclosed in your head you really don&#39;t think you as a person are useful in any high capacity manor. Don&#39;t get me started on tobacco that stuff is just brutal and will kill you, it is so much more addictive than anything this world can throw at you. One cigarette or one line, the cig is what I&#39;m thinking about the next day. EDIT: I guess what I&#39;m saying is our population is getting so smart now, they&#39;re allowing it to come back because it&#39;ll make them billions at everyone else&#39;s expense. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Absolutely this. I use to be a heavy smoker when I was in my late teens/early twenties. When I decided I needed to stop for any variety of factors, it was as simple as stopping for me. I didn&#39;t have withdrawals, i didnt have insomnia, etc...</p>

<p>Did I want to smoke? Sure. Did I need to smoke? No. Could I be around others that were smoking without joining? Yup. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know if I have a propensity for addiction. I don&#39;t drink, but I do smoke cigs. I would most likely struggle to quit smoking cigarettes though.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are different people. Some people may have a prediliction for getting stoned and going hiking, or working on a project, or whatever. Others may get stoned and sit on a couch and play video games.</p>

<p>What I am saying is if you remove the weed, I dont think someone is magically going to choose hiking over video games. </p>

<p>People are who they are. Marijuana doesn&#39;t fundamentally change who you are as a person. </p>

<p>Are unmotivated people MORE likely to smoke? Yes.
Are motivated people who smoke all of the sudden unmotivated? No.</p>

<p>Saying that those people arent at peak brain function is kind of pointless. Is a CEO going to be making important business decisions after smoking a blunt? probably not. </p>

<p>Does that CEO know when it would be appropriate to smoke? Yes. </p>

<p>It is like anything that alters your mind. Use responsibly, and it is a non issue. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Stoners spend money. Look at weed culture and all the media and merchandise associated with it. Look at how fast food companies pander to stoners in their advertisements. It&#39;s understandable, pot smokers are a big demographic. The quasi-legal status of marijuana is without a doubt intentional. Even though its illegal, it&#39;s becoming more and more culturally acceptable to be a pothead. </p>

<p>As for soullessness, there is a certain superficiality about the stoner&#39;s personality. If you&#39;ve dealt with these people before, you can understand. They&#39;re like children. They giggle and babble over nothing. They sit there and absorb feel-good media--propaganda even--without a second thought. Stoners are easy to control and condition. There is nothing rebellious about taking a drug which impairs your ability to control yourself. When you smoke weed, your higher judgement is destroyed, leaving behind feelings which are merely sensual. You become sub-human.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think your first point is a broad brush stroke on a portion of people. It disregards a good portion of stoners the &quot;hippies&quot; that are well known to spend very little money by having communes and being as self sufficient as they can be. 
Marijuana was pretty culturally acceptable until recently in the USA. It has only been outlawed for under 100 years. George Washington grew it and smoked it, same with Lincoln.
To your soullessness claim again broad brush. Are there stoners who just sit around and giggle? Sure. There are people in any sub group of the overall population that just sit around laugh over nothing.
To your belief that they are sub-human would you consider Bill Gates, Shakespeare, Steve Jobs, Carl Sagan, and Bob Dylan subhuman? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have such mixed feelings regarding marijuana. On one hand, it&#39;s a miracle medicine for so many illnesses like epilepsy and gastric illnesses, but on the other hand, when I quit, I certainly had withdrawals for over a month. It helped me quit drinking alcohol when I was drinking way too much, brought me needed comfort, but it also caused me more discomfort in the long run. I think it should be legal, but it&#39;s not just all fun and games. </p>

<p>Ultimately, I started growing my own to support my habbit in an area where it&#39;s very illegal and almost went to prison for it and have a black mark on my record. I don&#39;t hate it for that, as I think the laws are wrong regarding it, but I do see it does have negative impacts now that I&#39;m clean. Some of my best thinking was done &quot;high,&quot; but some of my content not to move forward was caused by it too. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t hate those that use it, and I&#39;m certainly pro-legalizing, but let&#39;s all admit, nothing is without some consequence. Moderation is key.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Everyone&#39;s different. I&#39;m productive every day and I vape every night. Some weekends I can vape 2-3 times in a day. Still lift weights, run, read, hang out with friends, etc.</p>

<p>It also depends on the strain you use. If you smoke an indica-dominant hybrid or just an Indica (which is high in sedative terpenes like myrcene)  you are going to be couch-locked and pretty useless. On the other hand, I have smoked/vaped/eaten good sativas and I am usually pretty active on those since they are energizing.</p>

<p>If you have no discipline and simply smoke when you&#39;re bored of course you will develop a psychological addiction. Same for when you use it for sleep (don&#39;t do this - it degrades the quality of your sleep).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m a daily use so you might suspect I would disagree but I don&#39;t entirely.</p>

<p>It truly depends on the person. Before I began smoking at 40, I had spent my life in a haze. Unorganized, horrible decision making, unstable relationships, angry, bitter, constantly overwhelmed, somewhat hyperactivity. I imagine it&#39;s what true ADHD feels like. After smoking, I&#39;m a completely different person.</p>

<p>I admit there have been other things to bring these changes but marijuana gave the clarity to get there, to handle them as I should. And it didn&#39;t happen overnight. It took at least six months of daily micro dosing to build up in my system.</p>

<p>I admit I am addicted but it&#39;s not physical. When I&#39;m out, I am lethargic, overwhelmed, and prone to tears because my mind is fuzz again but there is no withdrawals, so to speak. I can manage but I know there is an easier way and that&#39;s my addiction.</p>

<p>So everyone is different. I think age is a factor too. The older one is, the less likely they are to experience the effect you do.  I think I read a study once to the effect, I&#39;ll see if I can find it and edit in the link.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I used to abuse the utter crap out of weed because I was totally miserable at uni and felt like I needed to escape. I still use it regularly, but in much smaller doses than before and I am feeling a hell of a lot better about life in general. I quit uni and I&#39;ve since got a job, started working on loads of creative projects on the side and been a lot more social than before. </p>

<p>Yes, weed can be addictive but it&#39;s only a debilitating addiction if you&#39;re relying on it as a means of escape imo. Just according to my experience anyway. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well I think it all comes from the abuse, but being illegal and people on jail for it just doesn&#39;t make sense. 
I would advice every human being in the planet to try it cause it just has some quality that changes priorities and allow you to see through some unnecessary crap, but I wouldn&#39;t recommend anybody to abuse it cause ultimately it mess with your ambition.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting thoughts; thanks for posting. I would only add that everyone is on their own journey, and for many people, they cannot begin to imagine walking in someone else&#39;s shoes. </p>

<p>I think your story is great and I hope you can keep your path going in a positive direction. </p>

<p>I also think I know someone quite well that started smoking in their late 30s and used the excuse to learn to write code and they are quite talented at it today. I&#39;m not sure he&#39;s gone without a smoke in the past 2-3 years, but you wouldn&#39;t know it. </p>

<p>I agree with your sentiment, but different strokes for different folks too.</p>

It is neither good nor bad, it just is.  I don&#39;t believe it should be used by anyone (kids) whose brain is still developing. Whether you become addicted is your fault alone.  Take what you&#39;ve learned and move on.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Absolutely this. I use to be a heavy smoker when I was in my late teens/early twenties. When I decided I needed to stop for any variety of factors, it was as simple as stopping for me. I didn&#39;t have withdrawals, i didnt have insomnia, etc...</p>

<p>Did I want to smoke? Sure. Did I need to smoke? No. Could I be around others that were smoking without joining? Yup. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know if I have a propensity for addiction. I don&#39;t drink, but I do smoke cigs. I would most likely struggle to quit smoking cigarettes though.</p>
