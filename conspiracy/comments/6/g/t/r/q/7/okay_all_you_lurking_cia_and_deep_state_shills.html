       Follow the evaluation which is now adding in a finite number of possibilities to the models in order to attempt to establish some sort of reasonable theory for what happened.

       Btw, the answer you've given was deemed as a 0% probability for cause of collapse after analyzing the computer models.

       Even if what you're saying is true, which I don't believe until I see some sources, that still doesn't disprove anything. You're talking about
       <em>
        one
       </em>
       university's department's computer models. That doesn't disprove the work and research of everyone else who has studied this topic, the majority of which deny the controlled demolition theory.

       That's not how this works. The majority of people who have worked on this are on my side. If you disagree with all of the research that occurred after 9/11, and disagree with the widely accepted account of what happened, it is up to
       <em>

       to provide proof that the "official story" isn't true.

       I'm not sure that I will take either you or the article at their word. It's best to be open minded and see where the evidence leads. Currently we have a couple of engineering models that we can interact with to find the answers and that's about it aside from the he said, she said that you've decided to place your faith in. There is no evidence on the one side. None. On the other hand we have evidence that it didn't happen as was said... that's all.

       Responding to a comment doesn't make me "defensive" or "confrontational". Also, changing the conversation from the topic at hand to someone's character is a pretty good indication that you're not confident in your beliefs.

      <p>
       This isn't the definition of proof. Belief is irrelevant when regarding what is true. Something being true and someone believing something is true can be two entirely different things. For example, there are people who believe the earth is flat. They believe this based on what they consider proof. What they consider proof, however, isn't actually proof, because the earth is not flat. You cannot prove something that isn't true.

       So, anyone who doesn't believe these weak, unsubstantiated conspiracy theories is close minded, then? Being open minded doesn't mean believing everything anyone tells you.

       Also, saying "just be open minded" is not an acceptable substitute for not having proof.

       This is just simply incorrect. Just because your side doesn't have proof, doesn't mean it's a "he said, she said" ordeal. Until your side provides some proof that shows the events on 9/11 did not occur as we've been told, then there's really nothing to discuss. Until then, the official story will stand, as it should. It's the only story with mounds of evidence, research, and consensus of professionals backing it up.

       I didn't say "just be open minded" either. I said I prefer being open minded to just accepting either side of that particular claim you made or the claims made in the article. How is that believing anything anyone tells me? It's the opposite.
      </p>

       I've provided you links to proof that events didn't occur as we've been told which is more than you can provide that they did. Otherwise you would provide your mounds of evidence and research which the consensus was based of off. Can't? Because the material is not publicly available.... which loops back to the beginning of this conversation.

       Your comments formatting and wording is an eyesore, so I won't respond to individual sentences, but instead ask a simple question: Do you have any proof that the 9/11 attacks were a conspiracy? Any proof at all? Because no one else seems to have any.
      </p>
      <p>
       And engineering models do not come close to constituting proof. Why should I believe those engineering models over the mounds of research and evidence that show the opposite of what the models show? You need more than a few models to have proof. And again, what people believe is irrelevant to the truth.

       Another attack? Geez... you should really try to live up to your own standards.
      </p>
      <p>
       You keep referring to mounds of evidence and research but continuously fail to provide any when asked, while I have provided ample amounts of material proof in the way of actual professionals that put their job and name on the line by speaking against the status quo in the name of math and science with actual mounds of research to back it up. If we assume there is an audience member to this material one day who has no preconceived notions on the topic, who do you think they would believe at this point? You wouldn't want to leave it like that would you? When you ask for evidence that is provided, you must in turn provide evidence to the contrary to further the discussion. Burden of proof is currently in your court. C'mon, should be easy with all those mounds around.
      </p>
      <p>
       I just want to point out that "what people believe is irrelevant to the truth" should be my stance on the subject as a conspiracy theorist if I had "no proof". Remember that just a few comments ago you were relying on group speak and saying the "majority" of researchers agree with you until I called that in to question as well.

       Oh yeah, that is plausible. They attached cables to the building and pulled it over, err, straight down... At a free fall rate... A half a million tons of 600+ foot steel structure, pulled straight down with cables. At nearly the same rate as dropping a bowling ball from the roof to the ground, the roof HIT the ground. Yep, makes perfect sense. Thanks.

       Two points:
      </p>
      <p>
       1) If "pull it" meant with cables, that doesn't necessarily mean they
       <em>
        did
       </em>
       . It could mean that, at that moment, Silverstein decided to cut their losses and pull it do it imminently, but the building fell down on its own before they had a chance to.
      </p>
      <p>
       2) Going on the "cut our losses" angle, the "it" in "pull it" could have also referred to the emergency effort. That is to say the "it" would be "the squad of firefighters inside the building."

       It seems to me that a more likely alternative explanation  would be that he meant to pull emergency personnel out of the building, figuring it to be a lost cause at that point.

       It's called physics. The only way for the building to collapse as it did, straight down at free fall speed, would be if there were no resistance from beneath. This means that the only way the building could have collapsed the way it did is if every floor up to the roof was turned to ash and dust. Burning debris is not capable of doing this. Explosives are. There have been larger fires in skyscrapers that have burned for longer and haven't taken buildings down. This is literally just a matter of physics and common sense. The same goes for the manner in which towers 1&amp;2 collapsed. There was not enough jet fuel on either of those planes to bring those buildings down.. think about it for a minute.

       All you have to do is use your eyes. If you have any understanding of physics at all, you can plainly see from the footage that building 7 was taken down with controlled demolition (I never claimed to be an expert on physics by the way, and you don't have to be an expert to understand the concept of Newton's laws)...
      </p>
      <p>
       Secondly, can you explain exactly what you mean by proof? Don't you think that if there was concrete proof that it was brought down with demolition that we wouldn't be discussing it on a conspiracy sub? Don't you think that if there was proof people all over the country would be outraged, or at least start to realize something fishy was happening that day?
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't be an idiot. The people that masterminded and carried out this henious crime are counting on people like you to continuing ignoring the science of what happened on that day. They are counting on you to continue to believe the obvious to the NIST report and the Warren Commission. Most importantly, they are counting on you to continue living your life in willful ignorance. Lastly, they are counting on you to continue being afraid. They want you doing EXACTLY what you are doing now: to remain in denial that our government was more than likely complicit in the murder of thousands of it's own people.

       Go watch the video of the building collapsing. You can clearly see debris strike the building. This collision caused fires to start within Building 7, which weakened the structure, aiding in the collapse.

       Can you not follow a conversation? I said that debris struck Building 7. Then, I said there's a video showing this, which is a video I'm sure we've all seen. A video of debris striking Building 7 is proof that debris did in fact hit Building 7.

       You're such a hypocrite it's almost unbelievable. You have provided absolutely no proof to support the claims that you are making, yet you are so upset that we aren't able to do the same for our claims. You might want to examine your definition of the word "proof". The only information you've regarded as proof has been your own. And the video you cited as proof is in no way shape or form anywhere near proof (and you said that yourself), so apparently a video is only proof if YOU say it is. Haha, this is great.

       My claims are backed up by mounds of evidence and research, and the consensus of people who conducted said research and investigations pertaining to 9/11. We saw Building 7 get struck by debris. This isn't debatable. If you haven't seen it, that's your problem. All you have to do is search "Building 7 debris" and you'll find the video. It's kind of a famous video, you know.

        Claim: Building 7 was hit by debris.
       </p>
       <p>
        Proof of claim: Video evidence that Building 7 was hit by debris.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       You having not seen the evidence is irrelevant. The video is pretty well known, since Building 7 has been the focus of many wacky theories. It takes a few seconds to find and watch that video. If you're not willing to put on minimal effort to finding that video, why should I? I even told you how to find the video.

       So, you've provided with me no proof that the official story is faulty, yet now you want to see proof from me? That's interesting. You can literally Google why 9/11 conspiracies don't make very much sense. It's not like this is an obscure topic. People have been trying to make the case for a conspiracy for years and yet none of them have come forward with any real proof. Only vague and unsubstantiated theories.

       I'm sure there are many people within government that do want to improve our country and the world as a whole, just as there are people in government that prioritize money, power, etc. Of course, government as a whole is way too corrupt, but painting the entire government as wholly good or bad just wouldn't be accurate.

       In short, yes, it's unlikely that a passport would be found, considering the nature of the attacks. However unlikely, it isn't impossible, since it did in fact happen. Also, we see tornados and natural disasters destroy buildings, but things like pictures, books, papers, etc are sometimes found afterwards. It's unlikely, but not unheard of.

       I would say that probably 80% of major engineers, scientists, and researchers in the world disagree COMPLETELY with the official story of 9/11, and your LACK of scientific evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm going to paint out a scenario for you here:
      </p>
      <p>
       Say you are an engineer or scientist, and you are researching how the building 7 came down. As any scientist should, you try to set your biases aside and begin researching with an open mind. Through your research you uncover evidence that the only way the building could have fallen the way it did is if there was a controlled demolition. You then realize that this means the official story is a lie, and makes you begin to wonder what else we were lied to about on that day. You know that the right thing to do is tell your superior what you have discovered. When you tell your superior your findings, you are told that you are wrong and there must be flaws in your research. You go back and check and everything you did was correct and makes sense. You return to your supervisor to show him/her your work. Your supervisor tells you he/she doesn't want to see it and suggests you let it go. The next day you are fired or replaced.
      </p>
      <p>
       Okay, the point of that was to illustrate what can happen when someone finds the truth who is not supposed to. Think for a minute about if our government is guilty of complicity in the attacks. If you worked for the government and found out they were, wouldn't you be afraid to tell people? I mean, you wouldn't know who is in on it and who isn't. You could be compromising yourself. This is how it works.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's this:

       Do you have a source for that statistic? It's obviously false. The number is well below 50%. If 80% of those people disagreed with the official story, we would be hearing about it.

       They probably weren't hit with as much debris. Building 7 was hit with a significant amount of debris.

       Building 7 did not house any FBI or NSA offices. They did house SEC and CIA offices though, so you're half right.

       I remember listening to a terrorism expert (who had always seemed like a shill to me) on Coast to Coast AM not too long after it happened who offered an explanation, blithely stating that government buildings were routinely wired with explosives for controlled demolition at a moments notice. On the morning of 9/11 some spook reported seeing a known terrorist among the faces in the crowd outside building 7 and therefore it must have been him who ran in and pushed the button. Can't remember the name of the guy, and of course I never heard that theory again, from him or anyone else.

       Good point! Maybe he meant pull it as in pull the rescue effort? What's the implication of the sentence before? "There's been such a tremendous loss of life." How is knocking down the building gonna alleviate that? It sounds more like he was trying to act concerned about the first responders. Again, I do believe it was controlled demo, I just don't think this is the smoking gun some people think it is.

       Pretty easily explainable? Not according to University of Alaska Fairbanks' (UAF) Civil and Environmental Engineering Department who have actually released their computer models to the public.
      </p>
      <p>
       Follow the evaluation which is now adding in a finite number of possibilities to the models in order to attempt to establish some sort of reasonable theory for what happened.
      </p>
      <p>
       Btw, the answer you've given was deemed as a 0% probability for cause of collapse after analyzing the computer models.

       Regarding that Silverstein quote and that link you posted, is their argument that he doesn't mean demolish when he said "pull it" but was actually referring to something else?

       Oh yeah, that is plausible. They attached cables to the building and pulled it over, err, straight down... At a free fall rate... A half a million tons of 600+ foot steel structure, pulled straight down with cables. At nearly the same rate as dropping a bowling ball from the roof to the ground, the roof HIT the ground. Yep, makes perfect sense. Thanks.

       This seems like a stretch to me, the stuff about pulling the building down with cables.
      </p>
      <p>
       It seems to me that a more likely alternative explanation  would be that he meant to pull emergency personnel out of the building, figuring it to be a lost cause at that point.

       Can you explain why other buildings that were closer to the two main towers than building 7 and were also hit with debris did not collapse? Didn't think so.
      </p>
      <p>
       Did you know that building 7 housed offices for the FBI, SEC, NSA and CIA; offices that are said to have contained many documents and information about corporate fraud that could have led to the inprisonment of some very wealthy and influential people? Didn't think so.
      </p>
      <p>
       Did you know that the section of the Pentagon that was hit by a "plane" on 9/11 just happened to be exactly where the department auditing the Pentagon for a missing 2.6 trillion was located? Didn't think so.

       I didn't say "just be open minded" either. I said I prefer being open minded to just accepting either side of that particular claim you made or the claims made in the article. How is that believing anything anyone tells me? It's the opposite.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've provided you links to proof that events didn't occur as we've been told which is more than you can provide that they did. Otherwise you would provide your mounds of evidence and research which the consensus was based of off. Can't? Because the material is not publicly available.... which loops back to the beginning of this conversation.
