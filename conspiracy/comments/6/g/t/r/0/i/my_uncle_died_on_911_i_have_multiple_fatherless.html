       Each victim I know they have an American Flag at their house and a chunk of the WTC. I can't even look at these anymore. My uncle was a year away from his pension, him and his wife were buying a retirement home in North Carolina and everything just shattered.After studying the topic and seeing this sub i am just disgusted and hopeless. For many this is just a conspiracy but i have seen lives completely altered. This cannot stand this cannot be the world we live in.

       I think I can understand the pain you feel, op.  I've been enraged for over 10 years about it.  I will never understand why more people aren't also enraged.  9/11 was the beginning of the end.

       Thanks for that. I'm very sorry for you and your family's loss.

       It is incredibly corrupt and esoterically significant as to why the Twin Towers were made to fall. It basically sparked the global quagmire we see and experience now....and it was done on purpose (in mine and many others' opinions). I'd say the best way to honor your Uncle would be to keep digging for the truth. All we can do.

       Don't get too hopeful... but, this may very well be the year that 9/11 is exposed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Dr. Leroy Hulsey and his engineering students at University of Alaska Fairbanks have just completed their 2-year study into WTC 7's collapse. They have concluded it could NOT have collapsed due to fires. Their report comes out in August. This gives us a solid scientific basis to refute the official story (and hopefully begin a real large-scale investigation into possible controlled demolition). All we need is public support.

       Sorry for your loss, but I have to say this: whats wrong with you people in America ?! It's been fucking 16 years since 9/11 and you haven't done anything to expose the truth, millions around the world have figured out by now who was behind it, but it takes more than just talking, you need to act now. We've been raped here in the middle east, the whole region is in flames because of the war on terror. So please, we're asking you as brothers in humanity to act now, got to the streets and confront those who are in charge, demand a proper investigation. And like Christopher Bollyn says: "solving 9/11 ends the war".

       Are you serious? We aren't saying it didn't happen, just the government had involvement. And it didn't happen like they said it did. Sorry for your loss but are you really coming to a conspiracy subreddit asking why we question 9/11? This just reeks of an emotional way to get people to stop looking into what really happened. Even if you experienced your loss you can understand this right?

       Hope to one day expose the responsible parties and bring them to justice: the Israelis, Saudis, Pakis and elements within our own government.
