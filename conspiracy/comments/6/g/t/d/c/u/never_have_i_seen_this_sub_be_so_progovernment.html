<p>All i can say is that, when did this sub become a place to go and cry about the government being given a hard time? If you even lurked this sub a few years ago, you would see the Anti-Bush and Anti-Obama posts. </p>

<p>Yea sure the MsM is in on bashing Trump because he doesn&#39;t push the same narrative he does but who gives a fuck. Fuck them and everyone part of the Trump Administration.</p>

<p>The GOP and the DNC are our enemies! Just because you hate HRC doesn&#39;t mean you should go around protecting Trump. I bet 99% of this sub is blue collar working class proletariat but yet you want to support someone who is saying fuck your health care, fuck your livable wage, and yea lets give power back to the banks.</p>

<p>The conspiracy I am now interested in is what the fuck are you doing on this sub if you are Pro-Trump and Pro-Government.</p>

<p>Note - I was pro-Trump during the election period not because i liked him or his policies. I was for him over HRC and that by no means is an endorsement to Trump, the GOP, or any form of current government </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Campaign Rhetoric Trump has nothing to do with President Trump, particularly in the &quot;anti-establishment&quot; vein. The CNP, Mercers, Kochs, all are represented in the Trump WH and he&#39;s given as many stamps as possible to their deep-set agendas, not his own. Look at the budget he&#39;s trying to pass. Look at easing religious org political &quot;speech,&quot; allowing even more big money into politics. Look at the Goldman-Sachs legacy and propping up even more big bank power. Look at even more support for the Saudis as it becomes more and more clear that they and the US deep state are running ISIL, our &quot;greatest enemy,&quot; at least in part. Look at even more power and authority going to the military and IC, and domestic, increasingly-militarized police. </p>

<p>The only establishment Trump was advertising wanting to take down was the liberal establishment. The conservative establishment is taking it&#39;s place, both the Tea Party wing and traces of neocon foreign policy. </p>

<p>After Hiliary lost, George Soros created this campaign to go after social media. The people here are primarily paid shills. Also it&#39;s not just this subreddit, but lots across reddit are facing the same problem.</p>

<p>I think the primary culprit might be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correct_the_Record">CTR (correct the record).</a> It&#39;s known that Clinton said that she wanted the Russian angle pushed when she lost, so these people would be the ones to do it on social media.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Careful.  I&#39;m not calling the Russia angle BS, I&#39;m just stating an observation.  Hillary blames Russia for getting caught cheating.  There&#39;s a difference.  </p>

<p>Keep in mind, Hillary&#39;s ideals are &quot;the majority&quot; (she got the most votes), which means most opinions Hillary does not agree with are the &quot;minority.&quot;   So when you say things like &quot;most people&quot; or &quot;anyone coming here&quot; it might not be true.  There is more evidence to suggest the minority opinion is the one you share, than them.  </p>

<p>If I understand your point, I think that should be obvious, since most &quot;conspiracies&quot; involve government corruption and coverup. That&#39;s why conspiracy theorists are minority opinions and we don&#39;t get many people coming in here supporting government.</p>

<p>So for people coming in here only for a trump &quot;conspiracy&quot; is rather unusual. There are tons of other conspiracies that the government is guilty of (e.g. 9/11, chemtrails, MKUltra, vaccines). So in general people here are not favorable to the government.</p>

<p>Can i ask which conspiracy you believe is the worst one government is guilty of? 9/11 perhaps?</p>

<p>Clinton has been shown to have said she wanted this angle to be pushed after she lost. Plus it&#39;s absurd that people&#39;s votes were hacked by Russia somehow. People know who they voted for and if you polled people about who they voted for, it would still show Trump as winning. </p>

<p>So the whole Russia thing is unproductive and meaningless. Everyone already knows that Trump is self-serving and would sell the country to Russia if he could. The reality is that Russia doesn&#39;t want to buy the US. Clinto and Trump are two sides of the same coin, so it doesn&#39;t do Russia any good with either of them.</p>

<p>Rich people have always controlled government. It was true for Obama and it was true for Bush before him. It&#39;s been true for at least the past 50 years. </p>

<p>This is called a hegelian dialectic. Problem-reaction-solution or you might think of it as good-cop, bad-cop. So the ruling elite have an agenda they want to push, so they have the bad guys (republicans) against the good guys (democrats) and the political theater makes it appear that they are against one another. in reality they are both millionaires maintaining the status quo. if the democrats really wanted to change things, then they have had plenty of time to do it over the past 50 years. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are upwards of a thousand data points demonstrating the efficacy of free market and government-managed health care looking at all countries over the past 150+ years.</p>

<p>Nearly universally the data shows that government-managed health care leads to better care for everyone, longer life, healthier life, lower costs and a better economy in general.</p>

<p>Even Thomas Paine knew that capitalism had hard limits when it came to meeting human necessities with narrow supply chains.</p>

<p>Acknowledging this makes it even more important to call out and root out government corruption because the government is necessary to fill this need.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Putting aside all concerns about thread manipulation for a moment. My general impression is that lots of the Trump crowd online are young or previously disengaged people who don&#39;t have any real context for what&#39;s happening. They felt like winners for one blinding moment and want to keep feeling like winners for as long as possible. The same combination fueled a lot of the Bernie fever here back in the day. It&#39;s nothing new, the interesting element to this go-around is that Trump has successfully isolated his core supporters from any other sources of information. He didn&#39;t even have to censor it. All he had to do was convince them that no one else can be trusted and they stopped looking of their own volition. </p>

<p>Will be interesting to see how things splinter and break as his presidency slowly fails. I worry about it because I live here, but the historian in me is eager to see which theory pans out. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>In the same vein, I bet many people who are now active in this sub weren&#39;t interested in conspiracies before they began supporting Trump. He&#39;ll acknowledge conspiracy theories only when they benefit him (eg. asking Russia to find Hillary&#39;s missing emails, claiming Obama wiretapped Trump Tower, Obama born outside U.S., etc.) and so perhaps many newcomers to this sub have only been exposed to/taken seriously those that he himself has acknowledged. That&#39;s a pretty simplistic view I&#39;ll admit, but it helps explain the blind spot many people seem to have for any conspiracy theory that paints Trump in a negative light. </p>

<p>They are a tightly knit group. Remember how in 2012 the internet was full of Republicans trashing Mitt Romney. But once Romney won the nomination, most did a complete 180. </p>

<p>Lots of this Trump worship comes directly out of that mindset. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Releasing all this mundane stuff under the guise of whistleblowing encouraged people to interpret it as sinister codes and conspiring in the first place. Exactly the sort of personal smearing, not whistleblowing, you were just implying that you are against. And even we agreed on your interpretation, Wikileaks still could have chosen to release only the relevant emails rather than dumping it all. Or did Podesta&#39;s risotto recipe serve a valuable whistle-blowing purpose?</p>

<p>The exact same thing could be done to anybody if their private communications were stolen and leaked. Anything can be spun to seem incriminating if there is motivation to do so. In this case the whistle-blowing was all backwards; release first, decide what the topic being whistle-blown about is afterwards. You don&#39;t see the problem there?</p>

Contrary to what google and wikipedia tell you, Fascism doesn&#39;t care about &quot;right&quot; or &quot;left&quot;. It&#39;s essentially an economic doctrine having to do with corporations and goods produced. The person you&#39;re responding to is more correct than you are. I suggest YOU go read some Mussolini or some Hitler if you want to know what Fascism really is. It isn&#39;t some inherently evil system like it&#39;s been made out to be.   </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Only because you want it to. Most societies today have Fascistic elements. It&#39;s just that the word has been used out of context so often and for so long that it&#39;s taken on a new and inaccurate meaning. Much like the concept of racism. It has nothing to do with right/left/oppression/justice. It&#39;s about nation and goods being produced within the nation, whether physical goods or something like broadcast media. Fascism has likely been vilified because it stands opposite to free market and multiculturalism. The latter being the one forced on us as of the late-20th century. This is why you&#39;ll probably never see any successful form of socialism implemented in the US. Multiculturalism stands as an antithesis to many economic and social systems.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>American public schools have been compromised by Marxists since at least the early 1960&#39;s. Free love? Pacifism? Free stuff!? Communes? Who could&#39;ve envisioned such a thing other than the Soviets who admitted that their efforts mostly went towards subverting American society on an individual level by way of influencing media and educational institutions? Nevermind the fact that McCarthy was ultimately proven right in the Venona papers. Nevermind the fact that, if you research the Ivy League, the majority of the leaders are self-proclaimed Marxists.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Socialism is about government taking over business. Fascism is about business taking over government.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They&#39;re both about govt regulating business, in a slightly different way. You don&#39;t know what you&#39;re talking about. It really isn&#39;t that different.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>One of the top comments in the conspiracy subreddit links you posted is a debunking of this idea that google changed the definition.</p>

<p>So where are you getting your information about what fascism is? Did you go to the library? Did you take a political science class? How much will you move the goalposts? Someone says the definition, you say that Google is compromised. Someone says they learned it in school 35 years ago, you say that public schools are compromised.</p>

<p>The Merriam-Webster definition is: &quot;a political philosophy, movement, or regime (such as that of the Fascisti) that exalts nation and often race above the individual and that stands for a centralized autocratic government headed by a dictatorial leader, severe economic and social regimentation, and forcible suppression of opposition&quot;</p>

<p>Which is counter to your belief that it&#39;s &quot;essentially an economic doctrine having to do with corporations and goods produced&quot;. It&#39;s much more than that. Where is your belief that it is purely economic coming from? Can you link a source?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The deep state along with a vast amount of corruption is being drug into the light. Much of this is happening because Trump won the presidency. They are exposing themselves in their effort to take him out. This is by definition a Conspiracy...</p>

<p>You can certainly make the argument that people on this sub are more &quot;pro-government&quot; than in the past. However, I would argue it is because the man at the top of the government is currently the victim of a vast conspiracy. This has nothing to do with policy, or the man himself. </p>

<p>Plenty of people speak out when Trump does something they don&#39;t agree with. Most Trump supporters did not support the Syrian strike because they were afraid it would lead to the war the voted to avoid.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s just as likely that Trump and Co. are truly in bed with the Russians and the deep state is exposing this. The Russian conspiracy was alive and well before Trump even won the GOP nomination back when Manafort was his campaign chair. All of the subsequent events, with Flynn/Sessions/Kushner all lying about meeting the Russians, the numerous dead Russians and exposed US spies in Russia after Trump&#39;s team began receiving briefings, Trump&#39;s team pursuing lifting of Russian sanctions, and the bizarre meeting between Trump and Kislyak in the White House all lend credence to the conspiracy theory and occurred after the original predictions.</p>

<p>Besides the fact plenty of people, including many here, hated her far, far before this previous election, there are plenty of people who hate Hillary and Trump..at the same time.</p>

<p>Just because some people who hate her support Trump no matter what doesn&#39;t mean everyone who hates her does. There has been plenty of reasons to dislike her for literal decades now.</p>

<p>And as for Pizzagate.. same thing. There have been plenty of people who don&#39;t like Trump but believe/investigated Pizzagate. Many of them were/are Sanders supporters.</p>

<p>It&#39;s common sense that disliking one candidate doesn&#39;t automatically mean you like or even support another candidate. That&#39;s a truly ridiculous black and white way of thinking. And that goes for anyone that tries to say you must be pro-hillary if you&#39;re anti-trump.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So wait, Trump is in office for half a year while still waiting on tons of his appointees to fill positions in the executive branch and he&#39;s suddenly &quot;the government&quot;?</p>

<p>There are still 2/3rds of the government that Trump has zero impact on. The same 2/3rds that have been screwing over all of us for the last few decades, long before Trump ever became a political figure.  </p>

<p>Conspiracy posters have always been critical of the the establishment and the media colluding to screw over the populace.  Now we have a President in office who ran on the establishment and media screwing over average Americans and you have the gall to feign ignorance as to how there could be any overlap between these crowds?</p>

<p>Sorry to break it to you champ, Trump is the first conspiracy theorist President.  You&#39;re going to have some overlap between his supporters and those who support conspiracy theories in general.  This is coming from someone who voted Johnson, and even voted Obama in 08 when I got wrapped up in the hope and change bullshit.</p>

<p>Because of this, we are seeing a lot of posts about immigration, party politics, foreign policy, etc. that are not political conspiracies at all- just political debate. </p>

<p>That annoying shit post on the top that the mods dubbed &quot;discussion&quot; is an example of this. I would argue It&#39;s a political &quot;discussion&quot; not a &quot;discussion&quot; about a bonafide, out of the ordinary political conspiracy. It may be a conspiracy of party politics, but it&#39;s normal for any president to have one political party &quot;conspiring&quot; against his success. </p>

<p>There&#39;s not 6 million. There&#39;s less than 50k of them. 90% of the &quot;subscribers&quot; are banned. Reddit doesn&#39;t remove banned users from subscriber counts.

<p>My mom is a perfect example.She is pro choice, pro marriage equality, she supports social programs. She if for a path to citizenship, and wants less intrusion from government in people&#39;s lives, and hates the corporate tax giveaways to oil companies and walmart.

    <div class="md"><p>It hasn&#39;t even been 6 months and we have spent the entire 6 months watching the media establishment work overtime to frame the guy for a bullshit fake Russian collusion story. Oh my! Some people talked to Russian diplomats! You know, almost like that&#39;s part of their job! The horror!  </p>

<p>Make no mistake: The Deep State and their MSM propaganda apparatus are fighting an all out war to prevent the true restoration of justice in this country. If they manage to oust Trump, then they have a chance of recovering. If not, then prosecutors will get a chance to sink their teeth into the deepest corruption ever exposed in the history of the world.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Of course it&#39;s not. You can think pro-Trump people are pro-government, but it&#39;s not that black and white. Many voted for him to ensure (who most know is ultra corrupt and evil) Hillary Clinton from getting into office. Many voted for him because they believed him to be a messiah. However, many also voted for him, knowing he wasn&#39;t a &quot;save all&quot; type messiah, but was hoping he would at least throw a wrench into the deep states plans, which he has done. TPP withdrawl, renegotiating NAFTA, pulling out of the Paris agreement, etc. If Trump is indeed a puppet, he is the worst possible puppet to have ever been &quot;put&quot; into office. No other politician would have done the few things he&#39;s done in half a year in office. I have many dislikes when it comes to Trump, but do not deny the damage he&#39;s done, at least on the surface, to the powers that be. Bombing Syria with no proof, trying to push Obamacare Lite, and other things have equally pissed me off, but things likes him being an asshole? Personality means nothing to me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay, but if Trump was actually a threat to the Deep State power structure, your argument is exactly the argument that Deep State/DNC shills would want to use. In fact it&#39;s exactly the argument that ShareBlue said they would use this year in the (alleged) leaks from the beginning of the year.  </p>

<p>Not accusing you of anything, but your argument is logically absurd. You are attempting to pidgeonhole people based on an extreme black-and-white view of the current political climate.  </p>

<p>Don&#39;t forget that this forum was very in support of Ron Paul, too.  </p>

<p>We&#39;re not anarchists, we&#39;re anti-corruption and anti-authoritarian. To many conspiracy theorists, this looks like the first chance we&#39;ve had in decades to blow the lid off the whole thing.  </p>

<p>I&#39;m not expecting you to agree with that viewpoint, but it&#39;s disingenuous to pretend that you don&#39;t know that is what Trump supporters in this forum are thinking.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Deep State doesn&#39;t have a political party, at least not one that is known to the public. The exact allegiance, intentions, origins, and current organizational structure are almost impossible for ordinary citizens to know, but there are a few things that have emerged from various leaks.  </p>

<p>As far as nuts and bolts influence on government, the Deep State can be seen in part as an attack on the integrity of the State Department and Department of Justice by covert agents driving an internal agenda that may be independent of the currently sitting administration. It is widely alleged that this is in conjunction with moles or agents within CIA, FBI, NSA, and other intelligence and law enforcement agencies.  </p>

<p>This power structure will attack administrations from any political party without partisan bias, only choosing sides as a matter of strategy. I believe they have been successful in corrupting aspects of both parties and have attacked every administration going back to the end of WWII. Many have alleged that this has something to do with Operation Paperclip. I don&#39;t know. However, I do suspect that the Bush&#39;s and the Clinton&#39;s were a legitimate example of the false left/right paradigm that had been exploited to control political discourse.  </p>

<p>I suspect there was a strategy at play to destroy the credibility of the right by building the foundations of a Police State following 9/11 under GWB, and then swing the pendulum to hijack the left with a new form of double-think inverted fascism. As such, a great deal of effort was put into corrupting DNC party mechanisms and the State Department and DoJ under Obama. However the corruption may extend back decades and includes members of both parties. The reason why it appears to be biased towards the DNC may just be a coincidence of which party was most recently targeted in this silent coup of the American system.  </p>

<p>This rabbit hole gets pretty messy, and there are a lot of suspicious individuals with a long history in politics, intelligence, DoS, and DoJ with connections to key events such as 9/11. Many of them are <em>not</em> household names, but some of them are.  </p>

<p>I really don&#39;t think this is a partisan issue. I think this a widespread attack against the American system by legitimate domestic enemies. </p>

<p>I couldn&#39;t have been more clear. Let me try this again. You cannot influence me with knee-jerk reactions to incomplete information. I am becoming immune to this strategy after watching it play out endlessly on CNN. Really, an out of context clip chosen by none other than CNN is your all you&#39;ve got? I don&#39;t buy it for a second. Look at his face. This is called strategy. That is called a poker face. He got elected, next he needed to get into office. Then he needed to clean house at DoS and DoJ and build his administration. We are nearing the conclusion of this stage, which is why they tried to turn the Russian hysteria up to eleven. He has the patience to do this right within the legal system one step at a time. The target is and has always been the Deep State power structure.  </p>

<p>I&#39;ll try this again. Can you explain to me, in your own words, why I should believe that Trump has gone back on his word?  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here is how this works here:</p>

<p>Trump is a god to people and they will not speak against him. Why? Because he stroked their ego. They had eight years of Obama and made up a million conspiracies about him they all believed - and now have egg on their face. But in the end? They got trump, the opposite of Obama. So they think they won.</p>

<p>They won&#39;t, they can&#39;t, speak out against him because to do so would be to admit that maybe they don&#39;t know what the hell they are talking about and never did.</p>

<p>So many on this sub will rush to protect their man. He owns them now so much that they have literally forgotten all of their morals, values, and principles they pretended to hold for eight years when attacking obama.</p>

<p>They won&#39;t, they can&#39;t, hold trump to the same standards they did before because they never really believed the shit they said.</p>

<p>If Ron Paul won in 08 or 12, this sub would have gone nuts. It would have been prooo government out the ass. The problem is, they are pro-person. They believe in one person. Government still sucks. You&#39;d want to acknowledge it less though, because you have faith in one person calling the shots. Surely he has everything to lose. </p>

<p>Another example. I think the fbi has done some fucked up things, but I have a relative and a distant friend who joined, so I have to believe because of my liking of them, that they are still good people. I can hope for good accomplishments from them and still overall be skeptical of the organization. I just will refrain more often. </p>

Just think for two seconds about what you believe. Assuming you are taking a side, either pro-Trump or anti-Trump, you are &quot;pro-government.&quot; You either support Trump and his administration (and some republicans), or you support the Democrats (and the other anti-Trump republicans), the mainstream media, the FBI, the CIA, and all of the other intelligence agencies (that is if you believe the leaks, the intelligence agencies&#39; claims, and the media&#39;s reporting on Trump). There are many people in this sub who are pushing mainstream media narratives here, many times literally quoting anti-Trump media articles. If you are one of these people, then you cannot say that the other side is &quot;pro-government&quot; without also admitting that you are pro-government as well. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree in some way with that, but the media also had a hugely negative effect on Trump&#39;s approval (the left hates him with a passion). It wasn&#39;t all positive imo.</p>

<p>Idk about Ron Paul, I was too young at the time, but from what I infer, did the media basically completely ignore him? I remember watching some videos of him speak and I was always curious why he wasn&#39;t even given a chance.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Trump is anti-establishment. He broke through all the MSM programming, the countless celebrities shilling for Hillary, the massive personal attack on Trump and his associates and supporters, the fake rape/assault charges against Trump and Assange. Trump broke through all of it and promised to drain the swamp (which would take more than 100 days to do, don&#39;t even go there).</p>

<p>This is the most anti-government president since JFK. This sub should be EXCITED, and should SUPPORT Trump when he does good, and speak up when he does bad - we should not be 100% negative.</p>

<p>If <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> was 100% anti-government FOREVER, how would we ever overcome the government/deep state? Don&#39;t get fooled into believing we should always be anti-government. If you want that, head over to <a href="/r/Anarchism">/r/Anarchism</a> or <a href="/r/LateStageCapitalism">/r/LateStageCapitalism</a> </p>

<p>I guess when the entire establishment, the left, deep state, MSN, and foreign leaders are attacking the POTUS. We should all join them. A lot of republicans are anti-Trump. John McCain handed over #PissGate and is hugely against Trump, and he&#39;s a republican.</p>

It&#39;s gotten worse and worse. And I think it&#39;s because the war against the cabals is coming very soon. They can&#39;t stop all the leaks, as technology expands.</p>
