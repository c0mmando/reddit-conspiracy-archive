        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I saw someone post here about how veganism being pushed is an agenda and is a part of depopulation. I think the post has since been deleted but I just wanted to say even though OP on this post was on the right path but almost the opposite if you get where I&#39;m coming from. </p>

<p>The meat industry is obviously fucking huge and the impact it has on the world is horrible. Whether you believe in climate change or not- you can&#39;t deny that the amount of water and land they use for animal agriculture is unbelievable. Gonna say - watch &#39;Cowspracy&#39;, &#39;Food INC&#39;, &#39;Food Matters&#39; they are my favourite documentaries about the meat and food industry. Cowspiracy will explain in much better detail to what I&#39;m getting at! But I just wanted to say that MEAT is a conspiracy!! I&#39;ve not got anything against meat eaters(I don&#39;t myself) but I&#39;m not here to try and convert you!!</p>

<p>Processed meat and warehouse farms are awful and eating too much of this can cause many problems! Obviously!! You&#39;re not all retarded!! But how I see it as is 
Too much meat + processed foods cause cancer, obesity, diabetes etc etc = $$$$$ pharmaceutical for a life long period. 
Animal agriculture is the leading cause of climate change (see in cowspiracy) = they don&#39;t tell us this and then continue to make us buy energy efficient light bulbs, take short showers ect ect but the impact we have on global warming is absolutely miniscule compared to animal agriculture. </p>

<p>I just wanted to post this because I can&#39;t bare the thought of anyone thinking vegan/veggie/clean eating is A BAD THING!!! Not asking you to eat no meat! But less meat won&#39;t do you any harm ;)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As you stated about obesity and cancer, have you watched the documentary called &quot;resistance&quot;? If you haven&#39;t watch it now, then think back to cowspiracy, the way the big corporations use the animals is not only sickening it&#39;s dangerous. Antibiotics use on animals is causing resistance and creating superbugs, which are already transmitting to humans, H7N9 influenza and other types of bird flu have also been rising due to the conditions the birds are kept in, these types of influenza are mutating rapidly and are already killing humans in china. I can assure you that we will see a influenza pandemic in the next couple of years.</p>

Years ago I used to be on anti-biotics at least once every 4 months. for tonsilitis/chest infection/flu cos I was sick all the time.

<p>I 100% agree with you. It&#39;s the meat industry that is being forced upon us. The amount of wasted meat is ridiculous in the world. At least farmed animals are being replenished. It&#39;s the sea life that isn&#39;t being replenished and is going to more than likely to affect in our life time. Bee&#39;s / honey will be gone in our lifetime aswell. It&#39;s shocking that people are trying to turn it the opposite way &#39;fruit and veg is bad and a conspiracy...&#39;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do some research yourself.</p>

<p>These chemical signals are not the same as nerve cells or a nervous system. Only animals have nerve cells. Certain bivalves are arguably insentient, despite having a rudimentary nervous system. Certain &quot;osyrtovegans&quot; make a case for eating oysters.</p>

<p>My doorbell sends a signal as well, but my doorbell is not sentient.</p>

<p>Science agrees—animals are sentient and experience pain and pleasure. Plants are not.</p>

<p>However, if you really cared about the moral stance of veganism: know that animals eat plants to get their sun energy, and by eating animals you kill much more life—both plant and animal—than if you ate the plants directly. It is impossible not to kill to survive, but it is possible to reduce the suffering we directly cause. The only way to do that is to eat plants directly.</p>

<p>I do find it difficult to think that there is less farmed cows than wild buffalo (I do know buffalo was massively populated, in one country / continent) because we are talking world wide farming here. The more people, the more cows needed.</p>

<p>As my last comment said, the only reason it&#39;s cows milk we use is because of the amount of milk stored in the udder. We really shouldn&#39;t be farming animals to milk them (we should be using other milk sources.) That all fits into the cow / meat conspiracy.</p>

Especially for saying veganism is a disease... Disgusting way to talk about people that can use human intellect to conciousally decide what food substances to eat and avoid. I applaud veggies, not look down on them and call them names...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s my understanding that we absorb the trauma placed on factory farmed animals.  The stress, hormones &amp; adrenaline released before and after slaughter are contained in the meat.</p>

<p>That stress is transmitted to the animal/human consuming it.  This is why traditional manners of slaughter involve humanity, to reduce trauma as much as possible.  Of course you can never be clear unless vegetarian.  </p>

<p>Pigs are another issue entirely.</p>

<p>Humans are most closely related to the great apes of the family Hominidae. This family includes orangutans, chimpanzees, gorillas, and bonobos. Of the great apes, humans share 98.8 percent of their DNA with bonobos and chimpanzees. Humans and gorillas share 98.4 percent of their DNA. Once the apes are not native to Africa however, the differences in DNA increase. Humans and orangutans share 96.9 percent of their DNA. Humans and monkeys share approximately 93 percent.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hypothetically it&#39;s possible to eat be vegan and keto.</p>

<p>As a (non-vegetarian) ketoer myself, I&#39;ve seen how it does wonders for one&#39;s health compared to the typical SAD diet.</p>

<p>Despite the stereotype of keto being an all-bacon-and-cheese diet, A keto diet allows for plenty of low-starch vegetables like leafy greens.</p>

<p>I can&#39;t justify eating meat as ethical, but blaming meat as a conspiracy, or something that automatically makes people who eat it unhealthy is far too simplistic and not supported by empirical evidence.</p>

<p>From what I&#39;ve seen of the research it looks like there&#39;s a bad synergy between eating too much empty carbs <em>and</em> too much animal products.</p>

<p>Global warming is a joke and people shouldnt take it seriously.  We have had the ability to fix it for decades.  If the government was so worried about global warming, why are we still using fossil fuels and coal power plants when there are better options ( <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid_fluoride_thorium_reactor">Thorium Nuclear Power</a> and <a href="https://newfederalistpapers.joomla.com/11-orbitalring">Solar Power from Space</a> ).

    <div class="md"><p>What&#39;s weird is my body forced me to go vegetarian. Up until late last year i ate meat and cheese indiscriminately but i started to wake up feeling really horrible in my stomach. It wasn&#39;t constipation or diarrhea it was just pain. So much pain i couldn&#39;t think straight i had to rest and take baths to get relief.</p>

<p>I thought i was becoming lactose intolerant so i got the lactose pills thinking that would help but the symptoms remained. I tried to eat less and less only eating soup or bone broth, i would be ok for a couple days then symptoms return.</p>

<p>The last time i was sick was in april for 4 days i did not eat it was my worst episode yet, week after week not knowing why i was so sick this had to be the last time. I don&#39;t remember what made me quit meat but i was at a last resort and had to start my diet at square 1.</p>

<p>I started watching some <a href="http://www.onegreenplanet.org/vegan-food/10-best-food-and-health-documentaries/">food documentaries</a> that helped me rethink my diet and ever since april i&#39;ve had no meat or cheese and i haven&#39;t been sick since. I don&#39;t know why my body reacted so violently to the diet i&#39;ve had my whole life. But it helped clear the mind fog i had and set me down a path of richer knowledge from this experience.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Probably. If i ever go back to eating meat it would only be 100% real farm style organic. The bigger problem with organic is that the USDA allows chickens who get 30 mins of sun a day to be called &quot;free range&quot; which is BS, same with cows that get 1 blade of grass in their corn feed are called &quot;grass fed&quot;. Unfortunately no one gives a shit about pigs so who knows whats going on in those farms. Grass fed? Free range? IDK all i know is no one cares.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a symbiotic relationship. These are very common in nature. I could understand trepidation if the relationship was wholly parasitic, but there are mutual benefits. Humans get honey, bees get taken care of and protected, and the environment gets pollinated. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Human beings evolved as carnivores. We need a certain amount of saturated fat from animals in order to be healthy. Not a lot, but a little. Believe it or not, saturated fat does have some essential nutrients, such as k2. in a perfect world, a little butter or full fat cheese or marbled meat or fish or poultry with skin on at least every other day + a ton of produce will keep you healthy.</p>

<p>But our food supply is fucked up. Our animals are not fed their indigenous foods, so they aren&#39;t making the right nutrients to be healthy, and thus these nutrients don&#39;t get passed on to us when we eat products from these animals. The animals are kept in unsanitary conditions, and are thus inherently contaminated with diseases in the raw meat/milk. They are given antibiotics and hormones that pass onto us. Eating regular animal products gives you almost no necessary nutrients and lots and lots of bad stuff. This is why most people feel better and lose weight on a vegan diet.</p>

<p>Everyone should only be eating animal products from animals fed indigenous foods (ie grass fed cows, not grain fed), animals that get to go out and roam, and that are free of hormones and antibiotics. These products are very expensive, and most people don&#39;t want to pay the money. But when you only eat a little -- as you should -- it isn&#39;t too bad on the budget.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>One more thought... When I was first diagnosed with my illness, I started reading a bunch of studies on PubMed to get information. The study results were wildly conflicting. Then I started looking at the bottom to see who funded the studies. There was a pattern that studies funded by Big Pharma reached X conclusion, and studies funded by universities, NIH, etc. would get Y conclusion. I decided to trust in Y results. When my dr. pushed X therapy on me, I told him about what I had discovered on PubMed, and he told me that &quot;just because the science is funded by Pharma doesn&#39;t mean its bad science. X is the AMA recommended treatment, not Y and we need to trust the AMA.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I took a tour of a poultry facility a few years ago. I haven&#39;t been able to eat chicken since. The duress these animals are under is inhumane. I don&#39;t even want to get into the details, but no living thing should be treated with such disrespect. We should treat these animals with love and care, as they are providing us with food to live. I only buy meat from local farmers, who I know, and who treat their livestock as if they&#39;re their pets. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>that&#39;s a perfect way to look at it. i appreciate meat eaters when they still care about animals and their care. after hearing 1 hunter speak on a joe rogan podcast i completely changed my mind about hunting, lots of these passionate hunters care more about wildlife and nature than most! </p>

Therefore, they assign the dirty work to others (including their own children) so as to keep the blood off their hands. They rave about the humane treatment of animals and then sit down to a delicious hamburger from a whitewashed slaughterhouse down the street and out of sight. But even more hypocritical, they pay taxes to finance a professional association of hit men collectively called politicians, and then complain about corruption in government.</em></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Most vegans I&#39;ve met are rather pretentious and seem to distance themselves from the idea that death is necessary to sustain life. Hopefully their organic veggies weren&#39;t fertilized with blood meal or blood meal. You may not be able to hear the scream of a carrot as you pluck it from the ground but the other plants around can.</p>

<p>You can be a vegetarian and still contribute to agricultural runoff that pollutes the environment. Your helping turn the frogs gay!</p>

<p>People need to start producing more of their own food. It&#39;s the only way you&#39;ll really know what&#39;s in it and what impact it&#39;s having on the ecosystem.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There may be something to the vegan depopulation conspiracy bec there are a few nutrients that are only available from animal sources.  Many ppl aren&#39;t careful about supplementing their diet. I happen to know of a particular person with a broken pelvis due to low calcium intake on a vegan diet. </p>

<p>Most ppl want to decrease meat intake and a lot of the problem is the abusive food industry. If animals were raised humanely it would cost a lot more to buy meat and animal products, which would help ration intake.  Certified humanely raised products are becoming more available in regular stores, so increasing  animal products like milk, cheese and eggs with a clear conscience is possible. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Vegan or vegetarian can definitely be healthier, but it isnt a lot if the time. A lot of vegans I&#39;ve met just stop eating animal products and eat a lot of carbs, not really getting protein, not healthy- Spaghetti and sour kids aren&#39;t enough; but yes if you eat a lot of veggies and vegan proteins you can definitely be very healthy.</p>

<p>when talking about being removed from the food source, try spending time in the wilderness without food- you cant buy pea protein or tofurkey, you need protein eventually, and food in general is harder than you think to find and it takes calories to search, look at how much weight people lose in any survival show. </p>

<p>Yes heavily processed meat is unhealthy, and in some countries the way animals are farmed is cruel and not ethical, I agree this needs to be fixed and monitored.
Animal rights activists should support hunters- they put more money into conservation than any other group. Poachers are different and should be shot.</p>

<p>But as far as eating meat- humans secrete an enzyme which serves no purpose other than digesting meat protein (google protease).</p>

<p>Watch a lion eat a gazelle, or even a spider digest a fly alive, the animal kingdom is not &quot;warm and fuzzy&quot; and we are only artificially above it. If the big market crash or any of the big possible events happen, people will only need to worry about having enough calories to survive... how long will vegans last?</p>

<ol>
<li><p>I&#39;ve seen cave drawings and meat has been eaten a very lonnnnnnnnnnng time. Now in saying this processed meats haven&#39;t.  Have all these anti meat tests been done using cows naturally grazing on grass and not from industry?</p></li>
<li><p>Where do vegans get their natural vitamin B12 from if we were only meant to eat vegan? Without it you become very sick and unfortunately die. On the cave drawings I have not seen any prescription bottles for vitamins. </p></li>
