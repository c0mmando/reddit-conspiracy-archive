       Downvote if you must, but I believe a couple of things tie this community to the_donald.
      </p>
      <p>
       For one, it appears that several conspiracy theories have been revealed as actual conspiracies.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also think that, as time goes on in this age of Trump, we will see more of that: speculation turning into evidence based fact.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am unaware of your political leanings, nationality or creed. I don't know whether you hate Trump or love him. But I do believe that he is opening doors to paths Americans haven't seen in decades. Paths towards prosperity, liberty, and most importantly, the truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       It makes me sick that politicians have muddied the waters of our fair democratic republic.
      </p>
      <p>
       I look to the future, because decades of lies and deception have been heaved upon us like so many burdens.
      </p>
      <p>
       I truly believe this president promises restoration of Americana and ideals that every citizen can strive to achieve.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think conspiracies have abounded because of the darkness that corruption has brought upon us. We can restore the light. If you want to help, you can join us at T_D.
      </p>
      <p>
       They call us nutjobs, conspiracy theorists, crazy, even nazis, fascists, racist and sexist just because we are fighting to preserve America. If you've been called names, too...you'll never be called names on T_D.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thanks for reading. Fuck the oppressors. Fuck antifa. Fuck the lies, the time for sitting around is over.

       We're better off without the swamp. Incidentally, a lot of us were Bernie supporters.

       I think you're genuine so I'm answering this with consideration.
      </p>
      <p>
       You may very well be right.
      </p>
      <p>
       But on the other hand, how far would Trump get in draining the swamp if he simply went in and started chopping heads?  The deep state needed to
       <em>
        try
       </em>
       to get him on their side, and if he appeared to be playing along for awhile it put him in an advantageous situation over them.
      </p>
      <p>
       He even got them to feed the media that he was awesome when he "bombed" Syria (which was basically an already closed down base with defunct equipment and no people)!
      </p>
      <p>
       I didn't vote Trump and I'm not a fan of his policies. But if- IF- he is trying to unseat the deep state, he has to do it covertly.
      </p>
      <p>
       Which means we really have no idea if he's completely co-opted by them or not.
      </p>
      <p>
       But if he defeats them, he's got even bigger fish to fry next in the Rothschilds, HSBC, and Israel.
      </p>
      <p>
       So it's only steps we're seeing.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm hopeful this is the case- but we will simply have to wait and see.

       Give me a time machine to go back to 1783, and reverse the Treaty of Paris? Maybe we could undo our subjection to the Crown of Lodnon... Maybe then we could actually divorce ourselves, from the tentacles of the Holy Roman Empire... I digress. All "sides" are dumb as fuck, imo... You do not even know history... You're all condemned, imo.. Fuck you all. I share nothing in common... This country is damned, and has been under the military wing of banks...  Trump will not do shit, nor can anyone else.. But, yeah.. lets talk about politics... God damn... US citizens are dumb as fuck. So is the world... I digress.. Fuck this.... I'm going to seize an uninhabited island.....
