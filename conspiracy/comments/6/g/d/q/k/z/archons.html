    <div class="md"><p>They are created through the plunge of Sophia - so they are our disabled, blind siblings. Especially the demiurge, Yaldabaoth. They excel in error, which is their game - deception, fear, isolation etc. 
There is nothing &quot;evil&quot;, there are no enemies in a way, that there is merely a lack of light. They will lose their grip on every soul, who realizes their powerless and low position. As long as you see them as powerful, controlling and dominating, they will thank you for buying into their deception and artificial polarity (there is no polarity).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Even if I don&#39;t support icke or lash 100%, there are still good bits here and there in their own work. You don&#39;t need to subscribe to Ickes Reptilians, if you want to read about his works regarding the Clintons or the Saturn Moon Matrix. The same for Lash and his far right attitude in the last years. The goal of Lash is to murder the elite and anyone working for them (listen to his new stuff). But I like his work on the Archons, he shed&#39;s light on work, that the Elite tried to destroy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think so too. Lash thought, that the Telestei were too &quot;kind&quot; and naive, even with their knowledge and direct experience with Sophia (initiation). Intruders were able to destroy their knowledge and heritage like that. To counter the same deception today, he likes to fight them with every ability (physical, psychic) organized like the Archons do. I kinda resonate with this approach, but I don&#39;t think, that this is the best or most appropriate way at this stage. I understand, that resistance is necessary, like the body recognizes, isolates and destroys harmful substances. There needs to be a global awakening, which is still the first part in this analogy, I don&#39;t see us there yet. Glad that you resonate with my level of thinking...hard to find someone :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think, that Icke got the Archons AND the reptilians wrong. But that&#39;s no problem, because there is still some truth to both ideas regarding his work.

    <div class="md"><p>Archons is the original term for demons.</p>

<p>The &#39;devil&#39; is not so much an actual figure as a Church archetype. Satan and Lucifer are not the same thing. The Archons are the deceivers who interact with and manipulate human beings directly. Lucifer is just the coordinator, but is closer to an A.I. than an actual being now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes they are real. The Archons incarnated into human bodies are the main obstacle holding us back from Full Disclosure on many topics. They are primarily controlling the Jesuits, Zionists, Wahhabists, and there is another control group called the &#39;CHIMERA&#39; which is even higher up yet unseen by most people. Archons are coordinated by Yaldaboath (Gnostic name for Lucifer) from the plasma field around the Earth. </p>

<p>In the Old Testament Lucifer communicated as the gods Yahweh and Jehovah, and the Archons have been behind the Priesthood of the Church, Freemasonry, and other co-opted systems since.</p>

<p>Yahweh/Jehova/Allah is not Lucifer. That is Saturn, the supreme architect of this reality. Lucifer is a lesser being with conflicting goals to this figure, but neither entities are &quot;good&quot; in our sense.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lash despises the context and use of the word &quot;Archons&quot; in the way, Icke is using it. icke is using it, like people use it in this thread - the evil, bad demons and entities. Lash makes the distinction, that Archons are related to us through the plunge of Sophia. Nothing external or new, they envy us as organic, creative entities with access to the higher realms. I think, that it&#39;s important to read much about Gnostics, Archons etc, even if Icke for example doesn&#39;t get them right. To get out of the deception is to look the Archons in the eye, not to fear them and label them as something, that they are not - at least to my understanding.</p>
