       I saw an interesting case in which a man terrorized and sexually abused his wife, three young children, and pet dog. Abuse to his children include physical torment, stalking, humiliating punishment, malnourishment, and horribly detailed descriptions of sexual abuse and child sacrifice both in their presence and involving them.
      </p>
      <p>
       The childrens graphic testimony can be found here.

       The comments in this video spoke of mind control based on stimulation of the pineal gland through sodomy
      </p>
      <p>
       Comment below:
      </p>
      <p>
       The “Rite of Sodomy” “The Rite of Sodomy” is the central tenet of Trauma Based Mind Control programs,TBMC, promoted and popularised by Alistair Crowley, whereby the children/ trainee slaves are sodomised with dildos or other implements in order to manually manipulate nerve endings at the base of the spine, which stimulate the pineal gland, the master gland/ third eye, the CENTRE OF PSYCHIC AWARENESS IN THE HUMAN MIND, giving the subject flashes of cosmic consciousness, allowing the Master/Handler to "bind and control" their "slave"..

        http://www.whale.to/b/knox1.html THE
       </a>
       PINEAL GLAND PHYSICALLY AFFECTS EVERY SYSTEM IN THE HUMAN BODY AND HAS THE POTENTIAL TO DETERMINE THE EXPANSION AND CONTRACTION OF PSYCHIC AWARENESS, CONSCIOUSNESS AND EXPERIENCE OF DIVINITY. The Satanic, Luciferian, occult, sexual abuse, hypnotism, etc. aspects of the TBMC programs help to obscure the significance of the central tenet of TBMC which is the" Rite of Sodomy,"

       I bring forward Freuds Abandoned Theory of Seduction. According to the theory, a repressed memory of an early childhood sexual abuse or molestation experience was the essential precondition for certain mental conditions.

       he was surprised that in all cases, the father, had to be accused of being perverse... surely such widespread perversions against children are not very probable...

Its hieroglyph is the Eleventh Key of the Book of Thoth. In the union of electrochemical and stellar vibrations represented by Babalon and the Beast, lies the key to the next stage in the advancement of evolution upon this planet. It will be achieved by a willed congress with extra-terrestrial entities of which, in a sense, Aiwaz is the immediate messenger to humanity..."

       Marijuana made all the thoughts i hared come up. Its needed sometimes. Psychedelics too. Ive had mushrooms reveal some shit. A lot of good conspiracy convos with friends tripping. One lead to me plotting on how to kill all the archons and chemtrail pilots for 3 hours pacing in the desert. Remember. The plants and mother earth are not on "their" side as "they" which to destroy and pervert nature

       There are two trains of thought with reactions, it depends on  individual genetics/predispositions
      </p>
      <p>
       For some (more grounded in reality, higher working memory capacity, mood disorders like depression/bipolar or externalized anxiety) Marianas definitely helps them relax and think outside the box.
      </p>
      <p>
       For others (less grounded, lower working memory, ADHD/schizophrenia or other internalized anxiety disorders) marijuana is very very bad and worsens conditions/paranoia.

       ADHD is the best understood and easily treatable mental illness.
      </p>
      <p>
       Schizophrenia is the most poorly understood mental illness, ahead of OCD.
      </p>
      <p>
       Schizophrenia is so poorly understood you could go to a psych, claim to have visions, and they aren't able to do a brainscan and Disprove your symptoms because it's so complex and wide ranging.

       Indeed. Schizophrenia is a very scary and confusing illness. 
Ive seen her "short circuit" and start talking like shes at work (waitress) same tone of voice, facial expression, everything. Very intrusive and negative voices.
      </p>
      <p>
       Weed doesn't really get her high it just brings a sense of calmness and quites the voices. But i believe calmness is in itself as healthy as medecine.

       Do your research. You know what caused this kids to recant their claims?
      </p>
      <p>
       Once court proceedings began, the children were sent to a Tavistock clinic for regular counseling sessions. The children later withdrew their allegations and no convictions were placed.

       If I had to guess, it's related to when reddit purged all the fatpeoplehate-users and drove them to voat and 8chan, like slimgur (replacing imgur because imgur "had fat people" working there and removed their public images making fun of slightly tubby people - not even fat) and other fat/slim -sites.

       My mom and dad and me each were raped a bunch as kids, and we all have these kid voices with names that are really hard to describe. My mom's is named frisbee, my dad's is Geoff or Bike-o, and mine is Dust. Dust is a real hard dude, no one hurts him. He can look at you exactly as you are, so evil people hate him and want to hurt him more, but he just keeps looking.

       It's all very connected. As someone who has spent loads of time on voats pizzagate forum the pineal gland comes up regularly In regards to ritual abuse. What the exact connection is can only be theorised by us non-enlightened, but theories range from what you have said, to the pineal gland being eaten after sacrifice to produce a DMT high.

       Max spiers in his final interview before his assassination spoke of the kundalani, and how raping a child before the age of 4 would "unlock" its potential and split the mind in two, allowing for a manufactured alter persona. Interesting, and ultra disturbing stuff.

       Also I neglected to mention the supposed  connection of the pineal gland to colomboma.
      </p>
      <p>
       According to some on voat, having the retina disorder is linked to a larger than average pineal gland.

       Both George Soros and Madeline Mcann have Colomboma, make of that what you will.

       Check out this interview its very in depth on the occult effects of molestation from ages 2-4. Although it does speak of occultish stuff very factually without much sourcing but the conspiracy were fighting would not lwt sources or proof of it exist.

       I've been taking 900~mcg of nascent iodine for the last 2 months because i heard it can replace chemical bonds in the pineal gland of chloride/fluoride/bromide. If nothing else, most people are iodine deficient since most have been removed from salt now, and bread a while ago. I also supplement Selenium with it since I read it could cause an auto immune disease in way higher doses (1mg a day is considered safe). I wanted to know others thoughts on it.
      </p>

       Just from my experience, my dreams are very long now (even 2 hours feels like 6) and reflect reality more than fiction. It's not really a placebo effect because every single night now feels like going to a slightly different reality and living a life, and this hasn't happened before i started.
