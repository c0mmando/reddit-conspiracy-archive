        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The practice water fluoridation in the United States has been under growing scrutiny for years by a public that has become conscious of the fact adding toxic chemicals which are proven to be harmful to human health and children’s development to public water is medication without consent.</p>

<p>Never-the-less, the effort to stop fluoridation of municipal water supplies has been an uphill battle against entrenched financial interests and against dated ideas about health. While each year we hear news of cities heeding the concerns of their citizens and stopping fluoridation, without a major victory at the national level, people will be fighting this for years to come, all the while consuming toxic chemicals in the one thing we cannot live without, water.</p>

<p>The Fluoride Action Network (FAN) is reporting on a major development to cut the head off of this snake, and an unprecedented lawsuit is now holding promise for a national reversal of municipal water fluoridation.</p>

<p>Based on neurotoxicity studies, the “EPA has been served with a petition that includes more than 2,500 pages of scientific documentation detailing the risks of water fluoridation to human health.”</p>

<p>As noted by FAN in a recent press release:</p>

<p>“<em>This case will present the first time a court will consider the neurotoxicity of fluoride and the question of whether fluoridation presents an unreasonable risk under the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA)</em>.</p>

<p><em>And, in contrast to most other legal challenges of Agency actions, TSCA gives us the right to get the federal court to consider our evidence ‘de novo’ — meaning federal courts are to conduct their own independent review of the evidence without deference to the EPA’s judgment.</em>”</p>

<p>The lawsuit has been served along with a petition containing thousands of signatures of concerned and well-informed citizens, and includes more than 2500 pages of documents detailing the harm inherent in poisoning the pubic with fluoride.</p>

<p>In detail, the complaint is an attempt to demonstrate how this practice violates the Toxic Substances Control Act.</p>

<p>“<em>The Fluoride Action Network (FAN), along with a coalition of environmental and public health groups has filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California against the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in response to their denial of our petition under Section 21 of the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) seeking a ban on water fluoridation</em>.    </p>

<p><em>We believe this lawsuit is an unprecedented opportunity to end the practice once and for all in the U.S., and potentially throughout the world, based on the well-documented neurotoxicity of fluoride</em>. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fluoride is an extremely expensive pollutant to get rid of. It&#39;s also illegal to dump into rivers or streams. Yet industry somehow lobbied to dump it into our drinking water. Their solution to pollution is to dilute it down to 1ppm at levels deemed &#39;safe&#39;. You could literally get rid of any toxic waste this way.</p>
