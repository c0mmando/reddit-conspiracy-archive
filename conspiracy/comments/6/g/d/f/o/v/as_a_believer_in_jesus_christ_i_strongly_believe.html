    <div class="md"><p>In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.  He was in the beginning with God; all things were made through him, and without him was not anything made that was made.  In him was life, and the life was the light of men.  The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome it.</p>

<p>There was a man sent from God, whose name was John.  He came for testimony, to bear witness to the light, that all might believe through him. He was not the light, but came to bear witness to the light.</p>

<p>The true light that enlightens every man was coming into the world.  He was in the world, and the world was made through him, yet the world knew him not.  He came to his own home, and his own people received him not.  But to all who received him, who believed in his name, he gave power to become children of God; who were born, not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man, but of God.</p>

<p>And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us, full of grace and truth; we have beheld his glory, glory as of the only Son from the Father.  (John bore witness to him, and cried, “This was he of whom I said, ‘He who comes after me ranks before me, for he was before me.’”)  And from his fulness have we all received, grace upon grace.  For the law was given through Moses; grace and truth came through Jesus Christ.  No one has ever seen God; the only Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, he has made him known.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>At that time the disciples came to Jesus, saying, “Who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?”  And calling to him a child, he put him in the midst of them,  and said, “Truly, I say to you, unless you turn and become like children, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven.  Whoever humbles himself like this child, he is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven.</p>

<p>“Whoever receives one such child in my name receives me;  but whoever causes one of these little ones who believe in me to sin, it would be better for him to have a great millstone fastened round his neck and to be drowned in the depth of the sea.</p>

<p>“Woe to the world for temptations to sin! For it is necessary that temptations come, but woe to the man by whom the temptation comes!  And if your hand or your foot causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it from you; it is better for you to enter life maimed or lame than with two hands or two feet to be thrown into the eternal fire.  And if your eye causes you to sin, pluck it out and throw it from you; it is better for you to enter life with one eye than with two eyes to be thrown into the hell of fire.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s a complex question. The New Deal was actually very very slow to bring about economic recovery and FDR colluded with the British to involve the US in an unnecessary foreign war in complete opposition to US public opinion, being very tired of foreign engagements.</p>

<p>He knew about Pearl Harbor, and likely even instigated it with the hopes of having an excuse to enter the war on the side of Britain, and the result of decisively winning the war was complete destruction of Europe and the introduction of Communism to the world stage.</p>

<p>In essence, this is my argument against FDR.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>For some reason I just completely disregarded ww2 just now. There is so much there. I do think we probably let pearl harbor happen as a reason to enter the war. Here are my issues. I know it was harder than it is now to investigate, but fuck. How about stopping the wealthy elite from financing fucking hitler?! That being said, think about hitler. Would it have been that hard to get the country to agree to enter ww2? It was forever ago, but if they did let it happen it seems so superfluous. As we say in 2017, he was actually hitler.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You have to remember, what is Hitler in 2017 was not the Hitler of 1930s Germany. Nazi policy was basically built on ideas that had been either prevalent in Europe at the time (nationalist movements) or practiced in the US (racial purity legislation) and Britain (eugenics program). Since we&#39;ve abandoned those philosophies in our own countries, and essentially whitewashed our history, we forget how similar we actually were to the German National Socialists of that age. For example, did you realize that while Jessie Owens, American gold medalist in the German Olympics, could ride the bus along with other white Germans during his stay there, he was unable to mingle with white Americans in his own hometown?</p>

<p>The war itself was brutal, and the actions of the US and Britain were no exception. They firebombed German and European cities to complete obliteration, killings hundreds of thousands, eventually millions of civilians. It was almost necessary to exploit the already prevalent Holocaust propaganda as much as possible in order to conceal the nature of their own crimes, not to mention the far, far worse war atrocities commited by the Soviets. The Jewish press, of course, also took advantage of this to increase its stake in political and economic capital on the world stage.</p>

<p>As for the &quot;wealthy elite,&quot; they funded both the Germans and the Soviet Communists, knowing of course that they were sworn enemies and war was inevitable. War lines pockets, and the bigger the better. It didn&#39;t help diplomacy that Hitler was actively expelling these Jewish elites from the German banking system.</p>

<p>Many people will cite the invasion of Poland as the outbreak of war, and place the blame for this act solely on the state of Germany. I believe this is an extremely simplistic interpretation of a very complex political situation that had developed. Winston Churchill had been taking an overtly aggressive stance with Hitler who was merely fulfilling the campaign promises that he had made public to the world during his ascent to power. He attempted diplomatic resolutions to the territory in Poland that Germany required. Some of the land that had been taken from Germany as a result of the Treaty of Versailles divided East Prussia, where there were still many German businesses operating, from Germany, so that any business correspondence between East Prussia and Germany was relegated to sea-bound vessels. Hitler required for Germany a corridor to build an autobahn over land connecting the territories. The British advised the Poles to outright refuse diplomacy with the Germans, and this was in essence the pretext for the invasion (although the treatment of ethnic Germans by the Polish police was another aggravating factor).</p>

<p>Pat Buchanan wrote a book on this subject, you can find an interview he gave regarding that book <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSI5LkRGOKg">here</a>. I have not yet read his account, though I&#39;ve read several other accounts of the matter, including what is probably the most thoroughly documented &quot;contrary&quot; view of the impetus for war, &quot;The War that had Many Fathers&quot; by Gerd Shultze-Rhonof. He gives a lecture about his work <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBLgZAv_Iqo">here</a>.</p>

<p>Whether it was &quot;hard&quot; to convince the American people? It was probably a lot harder than it is today to convince Americans to enter a foreign war. They had just been part of a very very brutal one, rather meaningless to American interests. If you think about it, the only &quot;interest&quot; that&#39;s said to have been fulfilled by the Second War is the elimination of Hitler&#39;s Germany. So as usual, the obliteration of a sovereign nation-state should be the objective of &quot;righteous&quot; Americans, according to the military industrial war machine. Not much has changed, I must say.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay - I&#39;m just recently <em>educating myself</em> on all the Major Religions: </p>

<p>Here&#39;s what I understand about the <em>AntiChrist</em> - He comes from the Pit but he will be <em>adored by all</em>, incredibly handsome beyond belief, a smooth talker, persuasive beyond understanding in speech and manner, he will be KNOWN Worldwide and Revered Worldwide. Not sure about the head wounds but I think that is in there too.</p>

<p>Does any of that fit the last most recent US Presidents? Also, I  understand there will be many <em>called or considered as such</em> but Until The AntiChrist is in place - none will know the difference until it is late or something like that...</p>

<p>Perhaps you need to shop around a bit? Have you ever gone to a Saturday Church meeting? Is your Pastor or your Teachers open to the The Books of Enoch, Jasher, The Torah? Do they know and use Hebrew and Greek words to reinforce or correct the KJV? Have you yourself ever studied other religions? Do you always use the practice of <em>Test all Things</em>? Two or more to Witness? </p>

<p>Some of these things I&#39;m <em>learning</em> are key elements of Christian beliefs - right?</p>

<p>Just my two cents. As an agnostic (yes that worse Sin being luke warm...) I&#39;ve always considered myself <em>spiritual</em> but I was never raised in or under Religion so I&#39;m teaching myself what all this stuff is supposed to shake out towards - but FEAR? </p>

<p>NO! Never Bend Knee to Fear or those that would corrupt the Core!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just thought I would mention that the head wound is not a physical wound on the head of the anti-christ. The 7 headed dragon represents the 7 kingdoms, in a procession of kingdoms, that precede God&#39;s kingdom on earth.</p>

<p>The head wound just means that the kingdom appears to be slain (dead, defeated, conquered) but is reborn when the wound heals. So basically, the kingdom comes back to life.</p>
