<p>Over time &amp; extremely methodical use of religious texts, political maneuvers across the globe, &amp; the use of mass media to demonize &amp; completely pervert the truth about psychedelic plants TPTB have stopped the stoned ape&#39;s spiritual &amp; mental evolutions so as to ultimately enslave as many generations of &quot;Lilith&#39;s&quot; children as possible. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s only a theory, never been proven. But I&#39;m not arguing DMT&#39;s sacramental meaning, it gave me an unadulterated, fresh, new, and much needed view on everything. Mainly myself and who I should be if I wanted to end my suffering. </p>

<p>I see so much of the same ailments in others. Whether they&#39;re self medicating or not, we all want and need the same things. Now I know for certain the way. But it takes our own strength and constant vigilance to stay on the path :)</p>

Many people today see nature as something they go visit once a year on a vacation instead of something they are constantly a part of and something that effects them constantly.  Somehow people have become distant from their world and their nature, and it&#39;s been replaced by a controlled narrative.</p>

<p>How then can we say that a tasty mushroom could wake the world to what is going on? It&#39;s more complex than that.</p>

<p>Psychedelics certainly are the key to illumination and learning how to love. But I will go so far as to say that illumination is the fruit of a corrupt tree. Do what thou wilt, err... do your thing...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First off, sorry for the late reply my brother (I assume). </p>

<p>I love what you said about the perversion of nature. Loooooove. I laugh when people I meet here in the south immediately state that every decision &amp; every action can always be listed as good or evil all throughout the universe, even though we all here know that our collective level of evil here is nothing compared to that of a Clinton&#39;s. </p>

<p>Human&#39;s in America especially have lost touch with a teaching prevalent in pretty much every old civilization, that even though animals are consumable they are still life begat of this earth just as us that deserve the same respect &amp; reverence that we place on the constructs TPTB have deemed as the new natural. We tend to forget that without technology, our planets evolution has left us at a 2 on the apex predator list. We better not hope all tech gets wiped out one day or a lot of people are going to perish because they&#39;ve lost the inner animal to the domestication of our very DNA it seems. </p>

<p>Glad to hear I&#39;m not the only one that picked up on it. What&#39;s interesting is the fact that our dogs can pick up on it like the whole area has been circled in red pen. In France and Oregon they have no trouble with a bit of training helping us find mushrooms. Makes sense we would get 1/100th of that ability if theirs is really 100x fold better than ours.</p>

<p>The thing about these things is, is there is some universal experience of love and connection to our extended family in there despite how different the rest of the experience may seem to be.</p>

<p>The biggest clue for me personally that this is all a ruse would be the fact that the FDA has waived much bigger demons right through the gate while claiming this was the monster we were meant to fear. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s pretty interesting and it&#39;s really likely that even if neither of these were the burning bush, he probably ate them anyway. They were there.  I know in the Genesis it&#39;s written that all plants be kept as meat, so I think that rules out kosherness of plants; they probably had no such stigma as we do now on eating some plants. I&#39;m no scholar on the old Hebrew tribal traditions though.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Egyptian mystics applied psychadelics. Initiates would trip their asses off in a sensory deprivation chamber inside the great fucking pyramid. The Elusinian mysteries applied psychedelics, and probably many more. Moses was an Egyptian prince - he was initiated into the Egyptian mysteries. Plato went to Egypt AND the Elusinian mysteries. Psychedelics are a part of our cultural and human heritage.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Mushrooms ripped me out of a 10 year long slump of depression and anxiety. It literally changed me into a different person, albeit the real me, unbound by negative thoughts and feelings. It was almost as if I could see myself for who I was and not who I thought I was. My ego dissolved instantly. That night stands out in my mind in a profound way, and that was more than a decade ago. I&#39;m planning to try again with my newfound awakening. </p>

<p>Same thing with weed, but in a different sense. It makes me way more empathetic and motivated. Things that I&#39;ve been procrastinating on, I complete them. People I&#39;ve been neglecting to call, I call them. There&#39;s nothing wrong with being more fruitful. </p>
