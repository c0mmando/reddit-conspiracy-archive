       It was the brainchild of Sen. Chris Dodd (D-Conn.) and Rep. Barney Frank (D-Mass.) who primarily used their bill as a vehicle to grandstand their phony claims to punishing investment banks, to promote Elizabeth Warren to carry on their work through the unaccountable Consumer Protection Financial Bureau, and to generally punish the flyover people who seemed to be living too well for their tastes. Obama eagerly signed onto it and then called it a big part of his legacy.
      </p>
      <p>
       In reality, Dodd-Frank has been a curse on the economy. According to  Rep. Andy Biggs (R-Ariz), it has:
      </p>
      <p>
       Spawned 400 new crippling regulations on banks and their capacity to lend.
      </p>
      <p>
       -Favored big banks commonly found in the coastal cities over smaller banks commonly found in the heartland.
      </p>
      <p>
       -Enshrined bailouts into permanent law.
      </p>
      <p>
       -Harms bank lending among smaller banks which has in turn hampered startups which need bank capital.
      </p>
      <p>
       -Established the largely unaccountable Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.
      </p>
      <p>
       Biggs' list goes on, but the bottom line is, it's done way more harm than good and served only to promote big-bank and Democrat interests, even as the rest of the country has suffered.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fortunately, Congress is preparing to throw most of it out. Thursday, the House voted 233-186 to scrap key provisions of the Dodd Frank bill including cutting the power of the Consumer Protection Financial Bureau and finally allowing community banks to lend again.
      </p>
      <p>
       The economy deserves so much better than what it's been stuck with all these years.

        massive

       legislative policy implemented for the banks, they suddenly had no hand in crafting said legislation. This was written by the globalist cabal to intentionally stagnate wages and growth while siphoning more and more money from the proletariat. This was a way to eliminate competition and consolidate power while making small business success way less likely.

       Lol. That's not this works, that's now how any of this works. Eh. People believe what they want. 'Regulating the banks' has such a nice ring to it that it's hard to believe it's actually 'helping banks which are too big to fail get even bigger.'

       I don't remember it being advertised as a stepping-stone regulation. It's in its 7th year. When were the next steps going to be implemented to get it on the right track, exactly?

       It's also taking the collar off of the dog that didn't do anything wrong...because the bigger, louder dog that runs away got all of the other dogs in trouble for no reason. It could also be argued getting rid of it could pave the way for more effective regulations down the road.

       America is a developed country where growth isn't assured. Where is there to go when you're at the top? You'd have to squeeze those below you to grow, America does do that, extracting wealth from the developing world and 3rd world nations. But it does have to leave enough blood in its victims to do it again next year.

        Real GDP grew nearly 3% during President Bush's first term but only 0.5% during his second term. During the Clinton administration, GDP growth was close to 4%.
       </p>

      <p>
       So without Dodd-Frank the American GDP was only growing at a tiny rate anyways. At least it seems like a Democrat can get results, even if I don't agree with all their policies.

       Trump is trying to pass off his agenda as plausible with a 3% growth for the future, when even the Congressional Budget Office says it's more like 1.9%

       If Trump can't deliver on 3-4% growth, and then removed protections for consumers from banks, the Republican Party gets blamed, and voted out when banks decide to screw over the public as the economy contracts instead of grows. It's only fair, they're the ones who let the banks screw over the consumers, they're the ones who promised an overly-optomistic growth rate,
       <strong>
        and
       </strong>
       cut taxes for the rich.

      <p>
       You carry a torch for the rich as they decide to screw the poor out of more, either you are their useful tool or a wannabe.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        MULVANEY: "I went back and looked at some of the economic assumptions that the Obama administration made in its first couple of years. And I want to say on a couple of different occasions, their assumed growth rate was more than 4.5 percent. Come on, this is the first administration in history — OK? — it was the first decade, the first eight-year period in history not to have a 3 percent growth rate. Yet they were promising us 4.5 percent growth." — briefing Tuesday.
       </p>
       <p>
        THE FACTS: Obama's expectations for growth were in line with accepted economic views at the time. That's because accelerated growth often follows a downturn. He took office in a deep recession, and his team figured the economy would naturally rebound at a stronger pace than its average growth rate.
       </p>
       <p>
        Obama's first budget in 2009 estimated growth would be above 4 percent in 2011, 2012 and 2013. It would then settle into an average growth rate of 2.6 percent starting in 2015. That isn't that far from separate estimates by the Congressional Budget Office.
       </p>
       <p>
        The economy expanded instead at a sluggish pace, closer to 2 percent a year.
        <strong>
         Trump's budget is more ambitious than Obama's, rosy but thin on rationale for the optimism. It anticipates shifting growth above 3 percent, much higher than Obama's long-term average.
        </strong>

       "What about Obama!" doesn't really cut it. You have to defend Trumps numbers on Trumps plan.

       I have a dream, that one day the Republican kooks will stop blaming shit on Obama and or Hillary. Maybe some day when the Democrats stop blaming everything on the Russians.   I'm sure if the Republicans had been in power, the regulations would have been much stronger instead of just pretending to reign in the banks.
