       I've been banned from /x/, /pol/, and now /b/ for posting this. I'm related to the Mayor of a very recognizable city/town. In that city/Town, an investigative whistle blowing journalist was killed, after discovering an illegal opporation by the P.D She:He exposed it to the media, got a bit of coverage, then reported she/he was being stalked and harassed by the P.D for his/her actions, even taking very good measures to capture evidence. Including video/picture diaries of it. She/He then warned that if he/she died,it was because the police department murdered him. He/she was then found dead, with multiple injuries and the surrounding area (home) being tampered with. It was ruled a suicide. I will be meeting with a shared friend of the Mayor and me, they will be how I get into direct touch with the Mayor. I will supply all the evidence I can gather within the next few weeks, I will either get an answer for the wrongdoings and how she could respond to the evidence, or I will be shown action being taken for an independent investigation. Take a screenshot of this, I will be back within the next couple weeks to show what I've gathered so far. If I get banned I guess I'll try /b/. And if not that, then I will try reddit,

       I do not know anything game changing, all I do know is that press would surely enjoy a family member of the head of the city calling them out for not pursuing possible corruption. 
I figured the community would appreciate updates.

       I'm going to be looking into finding out any more details on it, might have to contact the same people that you all did from previous threads just to verify all facts.
I will be recording my conversation with the Mayor, if it's over text or e-mail, I will have screen shots.
If it's over the phone I need to find a way to record phone calls/skype calls/ FaceTime and the such.

       First, if you really do fear for your safety, read up on good OpSec. Reality Leigh Winner e.g. had very poor one.
      </p>
      <p>
       Second, if you want to communicate via anonymous accounts, make sure we know it's still you. E.g. get a easy to remember but hard to guess sentence, generate and publish the MD5 of that. Do that with a different phrase each post, and keep revealing the old one, so people can verify it's you. Should your account get hijacked, you can still take over from a different one.
       <br/>
       This is just an example, don't take it as the only working method.
      </p>
      <p>
       Third: good luck.

       It's not really hard to figure who I'm talking about if you lurk some.
Don't want to be rude, just don't want it getting so why spread, I'll be spooked if someone were to figure out any direct line to me, for obvious reasons.

I'm not sure how I would be able to do that while also proving I'm even related to her.
I guess just give it a few months and you'll either hear about it in the news, or you can see proof in my later posts when I document me contacting her.

       I have no real expectations to uncover any new details that would incriminate.
But, at the very least I can expect press coverage on why a Mayor wouldn't take a personal request for a possible independent investigation in what many consider grade A+ evidence of deadly corruption. If nothing, then it's nothing, oh well.
But if they're willing to kill, then they're willing to run drugs, guns, and obviously constant abuse of authority.

       I was not aware of that due to my distant relationship with her.
Then I suppose I'll be working with an ex-Mayor of Fresno, I'm sure she has connections still.
Better than nothing, might actually end up being a plus due to there not being as much eyes and pressure on her as a
       <em>
        former

       If you're serious we need to know what you're alleging against who and where. Who are The victims. What evidence you've collected. The timeline of events to the best of your knowledge. Without this I have to assume you're LARPing.

       OP what is the allegations being levied against the Fresno PD? Would be nice to know so we can research corroborating news articles and look for other whistleblowers into the matter. I do recall about 5 or 6 years back allegations against Fresno PD.

       Then don't listen?
I don't have anything to gain by lying to random people on the internet.
I'm compiling evidence that will be presented to actual city officials, I think that's more than most have done on here or in person concerning this case.
And by evidence, I mean I will be collecting every price of hardline evidence, and as said before, my biggest goal is that I need proof of Lang's social media posts/account.

I'm not sure how I would be able to do that while also proving I'm even related to her.
I guess just give it a few months and you'll either hear about it in the news, or you can see proof in my later posts when I document me contacting her.
