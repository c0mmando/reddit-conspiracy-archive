       If Hillary sneezed she would probably croak. At this point I think she's terminal and they won't prosecute because they'd be highlighting the extreme selfishness in running for that office while knowing you'd be dead before you can complete your term.

       Have to use the older accounts for increased perceived credibility. It's a straight down vote and move on to the next post without defending. Just have two or three make an echo chamber, have others vote them up, down vote dissenting opinions, control the narrative

       Yes, Trump telling the FBI to stop a criminal investigation is textbook obstruction of justice.

       Many legal experts have said this is cut and dry obstruction, and you're fooling yourself if you don't think Democrats are going to push for impeachment over the matter.

       Wait. You said clear evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       You must have meant to type no evidence at all, admitted from Comey's mouth.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump said I hope this will go away. That is in no way an order. It could be considered coersion if he had added "for your sake" or something. But simply wishing out loud for something is not the same as ordering that thing. Even if the listener chose to interpret it as orders, that was his choice.

       I said sworn testimony. As in Comey swore, under oath, that he felt Trump directed him to drop the investigation.

       So you're saying that Comey told the truth about his feelings in open court and that equals obstruction?
      </p>
      <p>
       He felt that Trump was ordering him despite having no actual language to support an order.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like, can anyone find me a piece of evidence where Trump says "I order you to close this investigation or I'll fire you."?
      </p>
      <p>
       All I've heard so far, said under oath, is that Trump told him he hoped it would go away.
      </p>
      <p>
       I still can't find any orders, or any obstruction. Sure it's shady as shit. But we don't prosecute or impeach politicians for being shady... I mean, we provably don't. There are laws allowing, promoting even, corruption of government.

       Didn't we already know "investigation" was deliberately rephrased as "matter"? Old news guys. Ditto with the FBI not physically checking the DNC servers. Today was the perfect opportunity for Comey to rail against those issues but he did not, right or wrong. Meanwhile there's a certain matter vis a vis "I hope you" vs "I order you" that will consume everyone for months.

       A couple problems with that. First, its an enhancement charge, and second, this adjustment applies if the defendant's obstructive conduct (A) occurred with respect to the investigation, prosecution, or sentencing of the defendant's instant offense of conviction, and (B) related to (i) the defendant's offense of conviction and any relevant conduct; or (ii) an otherwise closely related case, such as that of a co-defendant.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, generally "I hope" wouldn't be enough. This case is definitely a major outlier. Generally you need lies, threats, violence, etc for obstruction. IAAL so I find this sort of analysis interesting.

       I don't know how you're concluding that "I hope" is inherently and necessarily "clearly not an order." Obviously, as in these cases, it's analyzed in context. I don't know how that analysis would come out, but it's silly to conclude now that it definitely can't be construed as an order--especially Trump subsequently fired Comey.
      </p>
      <p>
       The specific enhancement analysis is irrelevant, as it applies to that specific charge, which is not on the table. The case merely goes to show that "I hope" can indeed be material language.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't believe that it's the case that you "need lies, threats, violence, etc" for obstruction. I think that an order to quash an investigation would qualify, and that "I hope" could depending on the circumstances be so construed. Moreover, it could be construed as an implicit threat to Comey's job--indeed, one that was carried out.

       It seems pretty straightforward.
      </p>
      <p>
       If I have authority over you and I say "I'm ordering you to end your investigation into me." Then that is clear obstruction.
      </p>
      <p>
       If I were to say "I hope this investigation of yours goes away soon." And you then choose to end that investigation, you have independently chosen to fulfill my hopes, not followed non-existent orders.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's like if I were to say to you "I wish someone would kill that guy over there." And you went over and shot him dead, you'd have independently decided on that course of action.
I would in no way have culpability.

       In court, there would be a much deeper dive on the circumstances of "I wish someone would kill that guy over there." Those circumstances would determine whether it was effectively an order or not.
      </p>
      <p>
       "I wish" and "I hope" aren't magic words. Courts are able and required to probe the circumstances, intent, and effect of such formulations. Otherwise every mafia hit order would be expressed as "I hope that rat gets shot soon."
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's remember of course that this is theoretical. This would come up (if at all) in the context of impeachment proceedings rather than criminal court, and as far as I know Congress can set whatever procedural/evidentiary rules that it likes. The standards of criminal court are just one lens.

       Then I'll explain:
      </p>
      <p>
       3C1.1, the guidelines bump, covers "obstruction of justice," including "with respect to the investigation." It doesn't define what it means to "obstruct or impede the administration of justice." (By comparison, 18 USC 1505 makes it a crime to endeavor "to influence, obstruct, or impede the due and proper administration of the law," also without specific elements of obstruction.)
      </p>
      <p>
       Can it be obstruction if you simply tell someone that you "hope" they'll act in a way that impedes an investigation? Trumpers say no, of course not, no way, no how. Lawyers say, of course it depends on the circumstances. The trial court in McDonald found that this statement, inter alia, was obstruction: “I hope and pray
to God you did not say anything about a weapon when you were in Iowa. Because it will make it worse on me and you even if they promised not to prosecute you."
      </p>
      <p>
       The McDonald statement is a clearer and easier case than the Trump statement. The trial court evidently found the "hope and pray" language significant, as it's part of the holding and the appellate opinion.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's silly to say, as you did, that "generally 'I hope' wouldn't be enough," as it's always going to depend on more than just a few words--context matters. It's even sillier to assert that McDonald "is definitely a major outlier," unless you happen to argue a lot of sentencings where 3C1.1 comes up. (And if you said you did, I don't think I'd believe you on this record.)
      </p>
      <p>
       I get that there's a narrative here. You don't have to follow it. Whether "I hope" is sufficient is going to depend on the circumstances, especially given that it's going to come up (if at all) in impeachment rather than criminal proceedings. Even so, cases like McDonald weigh in favor of considering the language as potential obstruction.
      </p>
      <p>
       I haven't read the other cases cited in the thread; the couple I glanced at looked pretty distinguishable.

      <p>
       Its true that I've never argued a case where 3C1.1 comes up, which of course wouldn't apply to Trump as I've said. And no, the interpretation of 3C1.1 is not the same as in 18 USC 1503, 1505 or 1512. The mens rea analysis isn't the same, which makes a huge difference and is why you can't use the referenced case to argue that Trump obstructed justice.

       I haven't taken a criminal case in over a decade. (And it didn't last long, the DOJ conceded error.) Everything I know about the guidelines I learned as a clerk during the Booker fallout, when every other case was about enhancements. Obstruction never came up, so maybe I'm missing something obvious--why would the mens rea analysis be different?
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't believe that I've "argue[d] that Trump obstructed justice." I've argued that it was unreasonable and a little goofy for you to assert that his language was "clearly not an order no matter how you spin it." It depends on circumstances, because (as McDonald indicates) "I hope that X happens" can certainly be reasonably intended and interpreted as a directive to make X happen.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know whether Trump obstructed justice. I'd love to hear the tapes, if any exist, and then have a juicy argument about the effect of the circumstances of that conversation.

       Since when is Comey slimy? I don't blame him for taking it as a directive from a boss who knows how to parse his words. Perhaps it wasn't meant that way, that's why he mentioned intent as something Mueller will need to consider if it comes to that. Personally I can think of a million mob movies where "I hope..." is used as a way to indirectly command, if not provide pressure. In Comey's case, his job was clearly on the line, and when presented with the "loyalty" pledge idea, I don't blame Comey or anyone for suspecting a sinister angle to the whole thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think he'll end up being indicted for obstruction, but Dems will try and bolster an impeachment case with it. Really wish Trump would have just said how much he likes Flynn and that he'd been treated unfairly and leave it at that.

       He leaked info to the NYT. But somehow the fact that Trump wasn't under investigation didn't get leaked. I'm just surprised that Trump didn't fire Comey earlier, the guy is pretty terrible.

       That was never the issue. The problem was that Trump was asking him to drop the Flynn investigation.

       How do you know what the issue for Trump was? I'd be willing to bet that Trump knew Comey leaked and was pissed, which is why he roasted him while firing him.

       You have a source for this claim? If Hillary's investigation was clean and legit, then why was the AG acting in such a way to deflect damage and legitimate criticism of Hillary? Seems as partisan as you can get.

       "The Justice Department knew a criminal investigation was underway, but officials said they were being technically accurate about the nature of the referral. Some at the F.B.I. suspected that Democratic appointees were playing semantic games to help Mrs. Clinton, who immediately seized on the statement to play down the issue. “It is not a criminal investigation,” she said, incorrectly. “It is a security review.”
      </p>
      <p>
       In September of that year, as Mr. Comey prepared for his first public questions about the case at congressional hearings and press briefings, he went across the street to the Justice Department to meet with Ms. Lynch and her staff.
      </p>
      <p>
       Both had been federal prosecutors in New York — Mr. Comey in the Manhattan limelight, Ms. Lynch in the lower-wattage Brooklyn office. The 6-foot-8 Mr. Comey commanded a room and the spotlight. Ms. Lynch, 5 feet tall, was known for being cautious and relentlessly on message. In her five months as attorney general, she had shown no sign of changing her style.
      </p>
      <p>
       At the meeting, everyone agreed that Mr. Comey should not reveal details about the Clinton investigation. But Ms. Lynch told him to be even more circumspect: Do not even call it an investigation, she said, according to three people who attended the meeting. Call it a “matter.”
      </p>
      <p>
       Ms. Lynch reasoned that the word “investigation” would raise other questions: What charges were being investigated? Who was the target? But most important, she believed that the department should stick by its policy of not confirming investigations.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was a by-the-book decision. But Mr. Comey and other F.B.I. officials regarded it as disingenuous in an investigation that was so widely known. And Mr. Comey was concerned that a Democratic attorney general was asking him to be misleading and line up his talking points with Mrs. Clinton’s campaign, according to people who spoke with him afterward.
      </p>
      <p>
       As the meeting broke up, George Z. Toscas, a national security prosecutor, ribbed Mr. Comey. “I guess you’re the Federal Bureau of Matters now,” Mr. Toscas said, according to two people who were there.
      </p>
      <p>
       Despite his concerns, Mr. Comey avoided calling it an investigation. “I am confident we have the resources and the personnel assigned to the matter,” Mr. Comey told reporters days after the meeting."
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe this matter v. investigation thing is new news to alot of people, and I guess this hearing was the first occasion where Comey confirmed that facet. It was clearly done by Lynch in order to publicly play down the seriousness of the investigation, for the public, as the election was pending. I get that aspect...stupid, looks shitty, but Comey didn't suggest any attempt was made to literally impede the investigation itself beyond how it was portrayed...besides Bill and Loretta on the plane, dumbasses.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was pretty common knowledge that this was a criminal investigation anyway, no matter what term Comey or Clinton called it.

       Is everyone ignoring that face that Lynch said this AFTER the tarmac conversation with Bill Clinton?
      </p>
      <p>
       BURR: Let me go back if I can very briefly to the decision to publicly go out with your results on the email. Was your decision influenced by the attorney general's tarmac meeting with the former president, Bill Clinton?
      </p>
      <p>
       COMEY: Yes. In ultimately conclusive way that was the thing that capped it for me, that I had to do something separately to protect the credibility of the investigation, which meant both the FBI and the justice department.
      </p>
      <p>
       BURR: Were there other things that contributed to that, that you can describe in an open session?
      </p>
      <p>
       COMEY: There were other things that contributed to that. One significant item I can't but know the committee's been briefed on, there's been some public accounts of it which are nonsense but I understand the committee has been briefed on the classified facts. Probably the only other consideration that I guess I can talk about in open setting is that at one point the attorney general had directed me not to call it an investigation, but instead to call it a matter, which confused me and concerned me, but that was one of the bricks in the load that led me to conclude I have to step away from the department if we're to close this case credibly.

       Just because the question was asked after he talked about the tarmac meeting does not mean the "matter" instruction happened after it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think his wording implies the opposite, but someone probably should've followed up and asked that to be sure

       believe this? Comey is likely a crook like the rest of them. These hearings are here to keep public faith in gov't and it's working.

HSBC is a totally unethical institution that's done a lot of business with the Clinton foundation. Hm.

       Well, the first part is wrong, he's worked in law his whole life, that's where he got to where he is, he has never "walked the beat", but is plenty knowledgeable on law, and apparently playing politics.

      <p>
       I don't think you understand how a board of directors works. Also, what exactly did HSBC do with the Clinton Foundation? HSBC was caught helping a criminal organization launder money. How? Some mid level branch executive didn't look at their documentation, when he should have.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is zero reason to believe, or evidence that anybody higher up had any idea it was going on. Certainly not anybody on the board of directors, who are completely ignorant of that level of operations. That's like a McDonald's manager deciding to shortchange everybody on chicken nuggets, and blaming the McDonald's board of directors.

       This is just another example and/or reminder of how political the government agency heads are. She might not be a 'politician' but it took just as much politicing just to make the final cut for a job like the AG of the US. Politicians do their deed in front of the public while high ranking government officials keep their politics and deals behind closed doors.

       They are not battling. They are creating distractions while they use the positions they have to forward the agenda they want. The battening for show. Pay attention the the agenda forwarded that is consisted with the last presidency.
