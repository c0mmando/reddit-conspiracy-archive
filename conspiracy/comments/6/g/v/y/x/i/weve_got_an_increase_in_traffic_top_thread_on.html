       Well, there's a few reasons I'm sure. First, let's stop blaming it all on share blue shills. In the same vein, there could be a zillion Russian and Donald bots updooting that shit to off set as well. It goes both ways.
      </p>

       I don't downvote on Reddit, but if I did, I would downvote it the post. So you have a ton of people not voting at all (like a real election ha!).

       Plus, let's face it, he does enough to attack his own rep.

       Plus, there's a lot of regular users who are pissed about the contestant pro/anti trump shit that happens here as this was a place that NEVER took the sides of oligarchs until ol' Jimbroni Trump was selected to be America's newest dictator.

       I'm just poking you, bro. I wouldn't be surprised if there are Chinese ones, North Korean ones. Would me editing my post make you feel better? And why do you downvote me every time we converse. It's not nice.

       What's your point?  It was posted by a fairly fresh profile, SHILLS can just buy old accounts/they don't need to make new ones and old users make New accounts all the time anyway, its no indication of anything suspicious.

       The grab them by the pussy comment was a very bad choice of words by him and gave great insight to his character. No one made him say and think those things, that was him. That's a big example.
      </p>
      <p>
       A smaller, but still very important example is Trump saying he has the best words while literally speaking at 4th grade level (look it up, they did studies on his words). That made him look like a moronic liar. No one did that to him.
      </p>
      <p>
       Oh telling his supporters he would pay their legal fees to beat up protesters made him look extremely nasty and so did the comment where he admitted that he could shoot someone in broad daylight on 5th Avenue and his supporters wouldn't care.
      </p>
      <p>
       These are 4 of the many many many examples of things Trump did himself to make him look awful. The media merely reported on his words, as is their job. It's not the media's fault they were such poor words and actions. That is trumps fault and his fault alone.

       No, there are objective problems with his behavior and words. If you don't see that, that is a sign of extreme bias from you. He doesn't act/hasn't acted normal and it's normal to understand that.

       It's amazing that this same nonsense deflection pops up in every thread about shills.

      <p>
       It's specifically pointed out in the title
       <strong>
        why

       it's suspicious and a good indicator of shills and you reply with trying to declare anything negative about Trump makes you a shill despite

        not once saying that

       It's a relevant question for this and other subs here though, among other places.
      </p>
      <p>
       I saw the same behavior during the Obama administration.  There were shills no doubt but there were also Americans who drank the Kool Aid he was serving because they really believed that criticism hurled at him originated from 1) racism or 2) the vast right-wing conspiracy.  Well, I don't fit under either of those options, I chose for Obama the same I choose for Trump - truth beats political partisanship.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump has his true believers who are not paid for their faithful defense but they're shills nonetheless and it has created significant problems for this sub.

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The only massive threads here about bot upvoting have been of direct evidence Shareblue subs were brigading and Anti-Trump threads were filled with Anti-Trump bots.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only claim "OMG Trump has bots" has been that if the Anti-Trump side is using bots and shills so heavily, then "Trump must be as well".
      </p>
      <p>
       So far there's been no evidence
       <a href="/r/The_Donald">
        /r/The_Donald
       </a>
       has used bots, let alone in any distinguishable manner (I think the best I've seen is a claim that 3% of T_D users are shills, which is hilarious to use as a "see they do it too!" when Shareblue subs have 60-80% of theirs as shills using the same metric), other than the claim that they "
       <strong>
        must do
       </strong>
       " every time Anti-Trump shills are called out.

       </a>
