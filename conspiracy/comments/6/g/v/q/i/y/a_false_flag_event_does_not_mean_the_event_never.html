<p>All too often we see users come to this sub and assume that a false flag event means that it never happened and no one got hurt or killed... or something along those lines... This needs to be properly explained that a false flag event usually happens as described but the details of who, why, how, etc. are all manipulated and spun to fit within the agenda of whomever created and executed the event.</p>

<p>No, because that will do nothing, but give the elites more power, control, and money... and we still die.  It also opens the door to the chances of making things worse, because of human arrogance.</p>

<p>If governments actually cared about the Earth they would not be doing the shit they are doing, same with Corporations. Getting rid of Globalism and Consumerism (as it stands) will have a more of an effect than the ponzi scheme that is &quot;carbon credits&quot;.</p>

<p>Ultimately, like I said, if the Mother Earth wants to do something... she will do it. Also, that doesn&#39;t even factor the Sun, because that alone is the biggest controller of the Climate here.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe that the elites have managed to milk us from both ends of the spectrum by rolling out the global warming crisis. They get money like they always have with things we&#39;re already dependent on (such as oil) and on top of that they&#39;re planning on hitting us with all these carbon taxes and shit. Pretty fucking brilliant, considering how much the masses believe it&#39;s a real thing.</p>

<p>I believe we shouldn&#39;t pollute the planet as much as possible, but whether global warming is caused by us or if we humans even have the power to reverse any of it remains to be seen. Like the cat lovin&#39; Putin guy said, mother earth is gonna do whatever the fuck she wants and I honestly don&#39;t think we have a say in any of it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Buddy there&#39;s a big fucking difference between notifying the loved ones of murder victims, versus plastering the murderers face and name all over 24/7 news channels.</p>

<p>To answer your shitty question, I probably would.</p>

<p>Any loved ones who ask should get to know. I don&#39;t think everyone else should automatically have access to that information.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A 20 year old EDP murdered 20 six year olds and his mother. Of course its going to be national news and the only thing people talk about. Despite there being over 11,000 homicides by guns each year in this country, it is still extremely unusual for a 20 year old to shoot up an elementary school. That is why it was &quot;plastered&quot; all over the 24/7 news. </p>

<p>And yeah, fuck the free press for reporting on the dominant event of that time. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah. no shit buddy. I&#39;m not confused as to why it was a huge news story. But thanks for spelling it out for me champ.</p>

<p>My entire point was that you can report a huge disgusting story like this without plastering his face and name everywhere. Do you think the families of the victims want to see his face and name everywhere for days/weeks after the incident?</p>

<p>What&#39;s your point here?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m thinking they keep the footage under lock down so psychopaths don&#39;t glorify it the same way that Columbine inspired people. Mass coverage of events like this tend to inspire more shooters, especially when footage or photos of the killer proliferate.

<p>Also, if they wanted the conspiracy theorists to go away, all they would have to do is release SOMETHING that they&#39;ve already deemed classified, and many would disappear. Although now, so much time has passed that if they did release something, everyone would then question the validity of it because they waited so long.</p>

<p>The point is, the police and the town are responsible for these conspiracy theories being created in the first place because of how much evidence they hid (even things like public records).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s another video on his channel that goes into more detail about Adam&#39;s possible motive including some forum posts he&#39;d made. I never really understood why these details weren&#39;t discussed on the news. It&#39;s clear that Lanza was a typical spree shooter. Maybe the whole pedophilia thing was too much? Maybe they thought discussing him in depth would fuel copycats? Maybe to avoid excessive blame of Nancy? Probably a mix of all of these. It&#39;s too bad because I think that would&#39;ve helped prevent the situation we have now.</p>

<p>Where have they ever said they do not have said imagery? This is typical of the kind of non-thinking people like you do. Merely because you haven&#39;t seen something you assume it doesn&#39;t exist. </p>

<p>Why the fuck did they demolish the school so soon after? Especially since they <strong>showed us the actual murder of kids from Columbine</strong> and the school is <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Columbine+High+School/@39.6038601,-105.0740923,15z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0xbc76791a6becf6b7!8m2!3d39.6038601!4d-105.0740923">still open</a>. </p>

<p>and</p>

<li>The group that did this wasn&#39;t smart enough to figure out what school to use to make sure that there wouldn&#39;t be recordings, so instead they had to make sure all the imagery of the event disappeared afterwards.

    <div class="md"><p>You have never known tragedy.</p>

<p>A friend of mine in college was murdered.  Specifically, he and his sister were camping, two ex-cons grabbed them.  He was beaten to death on the trail out of sight of his sister.  The girl was taken back to the campsite and raped for two days, being told she had to stay quiet or they would kill her brother.</p>

<p>They then left, telling her to stay quiet.  An hour later she was found by other campers.</p>

<p>The two ex-cons were found, confessed to everything, and one was put on death row.</p>

<p>This is that story:
<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/23/us/killing-and-rape-in-a-florida-national-forest.html">http://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/23/us/killing-and-rape-in-a-florida-national-forest.html</a></p>

<p>There were no doubts of the facts in the case.  None.  </p>

<p>We had a memorial service for her brother on our campus.  She came to it.  At the service, she came in smiling and bubbly, nearly manic.  However, we all read that as &quot;she has lost it.&quot;  and not &quot;obviously she isn&#39;t really grieving.&quot;</p>

<p>When someone this close to you dies, your mind can easily go through a series of whiplashing emotions.  Law and Order, CSI, NCIS, Mission Impossible, and other shows don&#39;t show the manic episodes.  They don&#39;t show the laughing hollowed-eye feel of someone in pain.  They just show weeping, since that is a better attachment for people.</p>

<p>You are watching this, saying to yourself, &quot;The appropriate reaction is ____ and that&#39;s not it.&quot;  What do you base your &quot;that is not an appropriate reaction&quot; statement on?  What life experience do you have that tells you this is &quot;wrong&quot;? </p>

<p>Or are you basing this on fictionalized accounts of grief that you&#39;ve seen?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Think of the most stressful situation you have ever been in. Were you able to think clearly? Now think of that stress and put yourself in a situation where people around you are actively being killed. When someone asks you who or what you saw then go and ask another person what the saw you&#39;re both going to say 2 completely different things. So when the police get a report of a 5&#39;2&quot;gun man wearing a red shirt and blue pants on the second floor killing people in a school from one witness. And a report of a 6&#39;5&quot; gun man with a green shirt and orange pants killing people on the first floor, theyre going to assume theyre looking for 2 guys even though the witnesses really saw the same person but are in such a state of shock that they dont really know what they saw. Chances are you have never been that stressed and I hope you never are, but you cant say something is a hoax because of a preliminary report.</p>

<p>Also most of the reports you get from the news are actually from police radio and the same thing happens you have multiple officers giving reports of the same event but theyre all a bit different and the media, rather than waiting for the facts to be given goes off of what they hear on these radios and 99% of people take what is said by the media as 100% fact. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You keep referring to things I have no problem with whatsoever. Or rather I want them myself. &quot;Challenging someone&quot; &quot;Approach critically&quot;. Please stop laying words in my mouth and trying to make out, I don&#39;t want discourse.</p>

<p>What I (and this thread) am referring to is the thread that made it to r/all and basically 90% of the comments were &quot;If you think Sandy Hook was a conspiracy you are a piece of shit&quot; (3rd highest), or inviting people to complain to NBC about giving him the opportunity to speak/&quot;spew lies&quot; (4th highest) and just lots of (again) ridicule and insults and basically zero debunking or arguments (other then the top post which was anecdotal but a fair point to the thread imo)
Please for a second understand what I am trying to say before replying with the same message again.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok yeah it was the news sub. Basically what I&#39;m saying is, I wouldn&#39;t want the same style of responses for this sub. I personally feel it (when used by establishment and news talk shows) is a way to discourage opinions that differ from the official story. You feel like I either join the choir - or I have a really high chance of being ridiculed and ostracised in the media landscape.</p>

<p>When I see similar stuff here, I just feel it legitimizes what&#39;s happening in the MSM.</p>

<p>For example in my country talking about conspiracy theories on TV would basically make you a persona non grata in media with no chance of rehabilitation. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>One of my friends I have known for 15 years responded as a paramedic to Sandy Hook. He had told me once what he saw. There were many dead children, the medics tried CPR, if you listen to the dispatch tapes you can hear the officers screaming for needing medics, there are ER nurses and doctors that pronounced them dead. Do you not see the crime scene photos? You&#39;re Absolute refusal to think that maybe it happened is just as bad to be as you thinking that I&#39;m clearly a sheep with the wool pulled over my eyes. My friend has since left being a medic, nearly killed himself twice, began drinking heavily. This is what happens when you get PTSD. But you care nothing for the suffering of others, only that your own agenda is met. That&#39;s so incredibly selfish. I hope one day you find the truth you do desperately say you seek, yet completely refuse to see any side but your own. Your not objective you&#39;re not looking for facts you&#39;re only trying to prove your smarter than everyone else and that your agenda is the truth. I feel sorry for you. How is it more likely that 500+ people can all perfectly keep a secret this damning this horrid, than it is that one asshole piece of shit killed a bunch of innocent children? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I lived in CT for 11 years and about 45 minutes from Newtown. I&#39;ve never known anybody from Newtown and only knew it as a point on my maps. Many of my friends from CT are firefighters and EMTs/paramedics, including a family member, and the only ones who openly will talk about Sandy Hook seriously doubt the official story. Of those that don&#39;t openly talk about it, they&#39;ll almost all admit to not having any links to any first responders from Newtown, but that&#39;s as far as they discuss the topic with anybody. Many of these people are still my friends with whom I keep in touch, some are friends of family.</p>

<p>Aside from firefighters and EMTs/paramedics, I knew the Hartford SWAT commander personally and knew a number of State Troopers. I also had a friendly relationship with the state Medical Examinder, Dr. Carver, for no reason other than my seeing him testify during jury duty multiple times and I shopped around the same town as him, so I saw and chatted with him regularly. I grew up in a military and law enforcement family and while I myself never served I&#39;ve always had the inclination to think all these professionals I personally knew were repeating scripts when they talked, and not sharing their experiences. In the same way that there are things servicemembers and PDs <em>can&#39;t</em> talk about, maybe due to a mission or an investigation, these people all changed and clammed up on the subject. I wasn&#39;t the only person to notice this. Dr. Carver I saw a few times after SH. I had always known a confident and capable man who was sure of himself and believed in the thoroughness of his work. The man I saw after SH was fearful. Not like PTSD, which I&#39;m familiar with no thank you to the friends who returned from Iraq but never quite came home, but like he was simply scared.</p>

<p>I also think it is relatively interesting that, outside of the internet, the greatest concentration of &quot;SH Official Story&quot; deniers/doubters I know is in Connecticut and not just centralized to my former hometown. Many people throughout the state have seemed to doubt the story.</p>

<p>Follow some of the comment threads in this post.

<p>All you have to do is get enough people to make others think there is a hard consensus on the matter. That way, it doesn&#39;t matter how reasonable or logically you argue against it, the majority will just dismiss you as one the &quot;crazy&quot; ones.</p>

<p>You cannot possibly lump together an entire group of people based on the actions of a very small few of the &quot;insane and cruel&quot;.</p>

<p>Is harassing the families cool? Fuck no. Is the theory that it didn&#39;t happen insane, and therefore everyone who believes it insane as well? Fuck no. </p>

<p>If the town, state, or even private businesses ins some cases would just release some BASIC evidence that most of the time should be public info anyway, then many (if not all) of these theories would go away. The problem is, they just hide behind the victims and say it&#39;s too painful for them to release that information, so we&#39;re not going to. Then the family is subjected to some &quot;insane and cruel&quot; treatment by people that want more evidence, which could have totally been avoided if they had just allowed public records to be seen by the public!</p>

<p>That event is one of the sketchiest conspiracy theories I&#39;ve ever seen. It has the most inconsistencies, blatant examples of censorship and concealing evidence, and glaring irregularities that have led so many people to question it. To dismiss all of that and all people who entertain the idea just because you don&#39;t agree with it is &quot;insane&quot;.</p>

<p>I know I&#39;ll probably get downvoted like crazy for this, but I cannot stand seeing how unfairly this topic is treated even in a GOD DAMN CONSPIRACY SUB. People calling the idea crazy get hundreds of upvotes, and anyone saying it has some merit gets downvoted to the negatives.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How is it disgusting? Because it&#39;s cruel to do to the families? What if this argument is exactly what they knew they would be able and planned to hide behind? Is it still cruel if the families were complicit in deceiving the entire world?</p>

<p>While I am strongly against going after any of the families personally, we shouldn&#39;t be forced to not ask any questions because it might hurt their feelings. But with the incredible lack of evidence that this event occurred as we were told, there&#39;s no doubt that people are going to come up with their own theories about what happened. If that&#39;s painful for the families, that&#39;s fine, just don&#39;t read them. Don&#39;t pay any attention to them. Don&#39;t try to argue with them unless you plan on providing evidence that has not been released before and would actually answer some of their questions.</p>

<p>Instead, we have the entire MSM (and even the entire conspiracy community apparently) saying that even asking questions is cruel or &quot;disgusting&quot;. </p>

<p>No one who questions this event is a &quot;foul human being&quot; like you&#39;ve stated. Maybe the people that go to the families in their personal lives and shout insults at them and call them liars are foul human beings, but people simply ASKING QUESTIONS does not in any way make them a foul human being. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because you&#39;re engaging in false equivalency. Trying to debate you on the merits of evidence would lend false credibility to your argument, when in reality, you are pushing a completely unfounded conspiracy theory with absolutely no evidence, and you deserve nothing but ridicule in return. No amount of facts or evidence will ever persuade you, because you have decided to ignore them outright. So rather than feed into a mockery of debate and humor your awful ideas, the best way to dissuade others from buying in is to rightfully make sure they know you are the town lunatic and that everything coming from your mouth is pure filth. </p>

<p>In reality, there is plenty of evidence for this theory which means it&#39;s not unfounded.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>First of all, you don&#39;t know me, nor do you know how or what I think. Secondly, yes, this is a conspiracy based sub, meaning often times the &quot;facts and evidence&quot; that come directly from the establishment that you&#39;re refering to is EXACTLY the kinds of things conspiracy theorists do. You say I&#39;m ignoring them outright? What am I ignoring exactly?? The &quot;fact&quot; that the police and the NYT said that this is what happened? Then sure, guilty. </p>

<p>All I&#39;m saying is that asking for REAL evidence, mainly in the form of information that should be publicly accessible in the first place, does not make anyone a lunatic, a nut job, or any of the other insults you seem to enjoy using.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There&#39;s plenty of nut jobs in town here. One of them likes to walk around screaming at the top of his lungs in imaginary arguments to nobody in particular. I don&#39;t try to debate against him either, I just let people know to stay away from him.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Way to compare someone asking legitimate questions about the sketchy details about an event (which has been used to erode more of American&#39;s freedoms) to a mentally disabled schizophrenic screaming with imaginary people. That&#39;ll show me!</p>

<p>It wasn&#39;t like this even a year ago, there&#39;s was a swift and effective shift in this sub that occurred towards the end of the election. It&#39;s possible this sub became inundated with more casual reddit users (r/politics types) due to the increase in MSM coverage of conspiracies. My personal belief is that this was a coordinated attack/takeover. They underestimated the impact a sub like this would have on something like the election, but once Trump began appealing to the conspiratorial crowd that all changed.</p>

No, watching a 6 minute Youtube video made by some random weirdo is <em>not</em> research. Perhaps this is where this massive divide is coming from; an earlier comment has even already mentioned this.</p>

<p>It&#39;s sad to me that you are receiving so many upvotes when others - who clearly are well-informed, and nowhere near &quot;extreme&quot; in their questioning of these happenings(making sure to clarify their position <em>against</em> contacting and/or harassing families, etc.) - are being downvoted to oblivion.  We cannot even <em>discuss</em> the possibility, because the thought of upsetting parents upsets you, so <em>must</em> believe the mainstream narrative ... and you&#39;re on a conspiracy forum, yet you see zero issue in this?

<p>Appreciate it, as that&#39;s exactly what it was. It&#39;s ridiculous how many downvotes you get whenever your start raising questions about Sandy Hook, yet no one will ever try to rationally argue why they don&#39;t believe it was a conspiracy.

    <div class="md"><p>the deeper complexity comes into the fact that REGARDLESS of the truth of the matter regarding the false flag, ---ALL EVENTS---will be exploited by media and public relations firms for various ends, all of them attempting to spin the narrative to suit their ends. </p>

<p>Every time I read a nutty non-engineering based discussion of what happened on 9/11 this is what pops into my mind.

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly. I was 21 on 9/11 and just happened to be watching the news when the first plane hit. Was glued to the tv for 3 solid days afterwards absorbing everything and even keeping a makeshift journal/timeline of events.</p>

<p>Building 7 was going to fall. We knew from the moment the first tower fell. All the various news sites were reporting that it could/would collapse at any minute from the impact of tower debris and weakened floors from fires. The narrative on how that transpired has been so warped over the years with cherry picked videos that it&#39;s disheartening for those seeking the real truth. At this point it&#39;s a pretty obvious smokescreen to distract from taking the topic seriously. </p>

<p>Likewise with BS theories about holographic missiles being used. Like they wouldn&#39;t just use actual planes and be done with it! All that &#39;really out there&#39; absurdity is just designed to make those mildly curious types stop in their tracks and laugh instead of getting invested. </p>

<p>Crisis actors are used to visually sell the narrative and provide specific soundbites as the actual victims can&#39;t be relied on to say what is &#39;needed&#39;. That <em>does not</em> automatically mean the entire thing was staged. It simply means whoever was creating the FF had assets in place to help sell it, wag the dog style, to the masses. The event <em>still</em> transpired as shown.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the conflation of these terms is intentional. </p>

<p>When 9/11 happened, many people posited and gave some good reasons why it was a false flag, that is, carried out or allowed to happen by people other than OBL and the 19 hijackers. So the public, broadly speaking, was confronted with two alternatives—al Qaeda or some neocon/CIA/Mossad combination—and to this day, many find the al Qaeda, official narrative implausible. </p>

<p>Fast forward to today, if you&#39;re trying to pull off a false flag, you know that there are going to be skeptics poking around. They&#39;re going to find some of your mistakes, so what better than to give them an third alternative to cling onto: the hoax. Even better if you plant a few clues that suggest it was a hoax. This has a number of benefits: </p>

<ol>
<li>Those looking for evidence of a hoax will find it, but it will be a red herring, distracting them from the evidence that would suggest false flag. </li>
<li>The hoax-believers will say horrible things about real victims, and in the process piss off &quot;normal&quot; people and turn them off <em>any</em> investigation. </li>
<li>The hoax and false-flag theories become conflated. The conspiracy theorists get baited into propping up a strawman the perpetrators created, and both theories get discredited. </li>
</ol>

<p>I&#39;m not saying there are <em>no</em> hoaxes of this type, but this &quot;false flag made to look like a hoax&quot; is a lot easier to pull off operationally, and strikes me as more plausible for most of what gets labelled a hoax around here. </p>

<p>What&#39;s even scarier, is when you think of the possibility that this is regularly used as a tool in shifting discussions online. I believe this happens in conspiracy and political forums. The group with something to hide merely has to construct conspiracy theories that are outlandish, and hope that enough people latch onto the notion and start to spread it around. Which has the effect of discrediting some people by making them silly, and shifting the discussion away from the real issues. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>For sure, and it&#39;s very effective. This is my best guess on the flat earth thing, and likely the origin of a few of the 9/11 theories (but honestly I couldn&#39;t tell you which ones.)</p>

<p>I think it has something to do with the psychology of a lot of conspiracy theorists. It&#39;s a pretty diverse group to be sure, but I think we have a tendency to <em>want</em> to believe the worst possible take on something. It&#39;s natural; we want to be vindicated, and the worse the real story is, the more &quot;right&quot; we are and the more &quot;wrong&quot; the official narrative is. There&#39;s also a peer pressure of sorts to believing in more &quot;out-there&quot; or &quot;anti-mainstream&quot; views, a sort of street cred that one &quot;has swallowed more red pills&quot; or isn&#39;t afraid to dig deeper. </p>

<p>I think these are somewhat natural tendencies, but we have to combat them—both in ourselves and our &quot;community.&quot; Fearlessly pursuing the truth is a good thing, but when we choose to believe an idea simply because it is more counter-narrative, we open ourselves up to preyed upon by disinfo peddlers, whether trolls, shills, or operatives. </p>

<p>My feeling is: you don&#39;t necessarily need to believe in FE to let go of Heliocentrism. The globe is simply false reality, if you research experiment on your own. </p>

<p>Read Gerrard Hickson&#39;s &quot;Kings Dethroned&quot; and other similar literature to see why we came to such false conclusions about &#39;outer space&#39;. It&#39;s not necessarily a &#39;conspiracy,&#39; rather a Scientific blunder, to describe it accurately. </p>

<p>FE might have turned into a &#39;conspiracy&#39; AFTER government rockets were able to fly above 40,000 feet. &quot;Oh, shit... we were wrong.&quot; Would they tell us?</p>

</blockquote>

<p>I agree, but disagree at the same time. Why? First of all, you&#39;re right, the math and physics are meant to workout appropriately given the <em>ASSUMED</em> constants and invented formulas; however, if you use <em>critical thinking</em> while resolving the math and physics, you&#39;ll realize that it isn&#39;t practical; does not reflect real life...it only works out on paper (garbage in garbage out). So what if it works out <em>on paper</em>? Is that necessarily real life? Not at all.</p>

<p>This is why I recommend reading <em>Kings Dethroned</em> by Gerrard Hickson. Read it for yourself and see what I&#39;m talking about. Just because they invented math to fit their model does not imply their model is reality. In fact, modern astronomy is false reality, and they are using it to take 18 Billion dollars a year from us, the tax payers, in return for fake moon landings and CGI space movies of. It&#39;s sickening, in my humble opinion. </p>

<p>Here&#39;s a question for those who think the globe is reality: can you find me a picture, without the sickening fisheye lens, that contradicts <a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/ChON8vwWIAE62Rr.jpg">&quot;SEA LEVEL&quot;</a>? Why do we call it &quot;SEA LEVEL&quot;, if, in fact, the oceans CURVE around a globe? We call it Sea Level because we literally see a level horizon...it&#39;s level from left to right of our viewing angel, so why assume that it curves from where we stand to the horizon itself, which is less in distance (~3 miles)?  </p>

<p>What do we know about water? <a href="https://i0.wp.com/flatearthdeception.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/water-lies-flat.jpg?w=480">It finds its level all the time</a>. This reality implies Earth is NOT a globe. </p>

<p>“You must be shapeless, formless, like water. When you pour water in a cup, it becomes the cup. When you pour water in a bottle, it becomes the bottle. When you pour water in a teapot, it becomes the teapot...” - Bruce Lee</p>

<p>Inspect the characteristics of water carefully and try to apply them to the globe reality. What you should realize: curving oceans is not just an absurd idea, it is also not Scientific. </p>

<p>Also, where can we find &#39;CURVE&#39; in the definition of <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=define%3A+horizson&amp;amp;oq=define%3A+horizson&amp;amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j69i58.1871j0j7&amp;amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8#q=define:+horizontal">&#39;HORIZONtal&#39;</a>? At which part of HORIZONtal does the curve begin to appear? There is no <em>CURVE</em> in <a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-wCFmC0SPZ2Q/Vb-BSxAXeiI/AAAAAAAAP68/QHWvfNb51O4/s1600/flat-earth-horizon-flat.jpg">HORIZON</a>?</p>

<p>If big G-Gravity is the best you can come up with to explain curving oceans, flying balls in space, and other absurdities of astronomical proportions, then you are in serious trouble.</p>

<p>They got us by the BALLS, mate! </p>

<p>I&#39;m not even sure what this means. I offered my commentary on the OP, and it became a top comment because the community upvoted it. I have more people that downvote my stuff here based on my name that upvote because of it. And I&#39;m not &quot;leading&quot; discussion, I&#39;m participating in it. I&#39;ve been a user here far longer than I&#39;ve been a mod, and I think it&#39;s good for mods to participate so we understand the community better. </p>

<p>I think you might be reading too much into my note to JCP. I haven&#39;t ruled out anything about 9/11 other than the official story being true. I&#39;ve had conversations about No Planes with Jim for over a year now. He&#39;s generally a proponent, and I play the skeptic. My reason for asking him what I did is to gauge his opinion on an alternative hypothesis for the No Planes evidence (of which I do find some compelling). That&#39;s how discussion goes, we challenge each other&#39;s ideas and arguments and see what stands up to scrutiny. </p>

<p>Looking at his reply, he&#39;s obviously not a proponent:</p>

Whatever happened, people got killed.

    <div class="md"><p>The difference is the scale IMO. In a typical murder case, there usually aren&#39;t lots of witnesses. You might get one or two people but there&#39;s more room for speculation. When a spree shooting or terrorist attack occurs, you&#39;ve got crowds of people who are witnesses in addition to first responders. There isn&#39;t as much room for speculation. In the case of Sandy Hook or other incidents where children are involved, people get emotional. They imagine what it&#39;d be like to lose their young child, sibling, neighbor, etc in such a violent way. When they see people claim that the victims were never murdered and/or existed, that their parents were in on it, or similar hoax theories in spite of the large amount of witnesses/victims, they assume the people making these claims are trolling or mentally unstable. This causes them to express anger at the former and extreme anger at people like Alex Jones who they believe may be exploiting the death of children for publicity. You also have the issue of harassment which supports the latter belief. </p>

<p>Now, I personally do think Alex Jones and others were exploiting the incident for publicity. There&#39;s legitimate anger there. Do I think everyone who believes the hoax theory is exploiting the situation? No. I just think they&#39;re uninformed/misguided and might not be considering all of the potential consequences of treating that theory as fact. I&#39;m sure if you talked to most people on an individual level, they&#39;d agree with this. However, when people get into groups and discuss the subject on places like Reddit, you&#39;ll observe the effects of group think which can sometimes motivate people to do some interesting things. Groups of people who believe the hoax theories are also affected by group think and I believe that plays a role in inspiring some hoaxers to do extreme things like harass people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well if you&#39;re just going to try to divine all the answers without looking at evidence, that&#39;s not the kind of reasoning I use. But anyway, you&#39;re not thinking about these things:</p>

<p>It&#39;s easier to get people, crisis actors or any facilitator, to participate in a hoax than in the wanton mass murder of innocent people. </p>

<p>It is easier to control the outcome of something that is fake, just as the number of victims and timelines is all scripted. You don&#39;t worry about all your plans falling through when your hitman patsy gets taken out by security or a Good Samaritan and rats you out as the mastermind. </p>

<p>Obviously, anyone would rather be guilty if found out of planning a hoax than committing actual mass murder. So much less risk in not killing people.</p>

<p>Finally, something people who make your argument never consider, if they were killing people they wouldn&#39;t let so much evidence go to waste. There would be evidence that people died. </p>

<p>No. Because you only have to get one person, not a great many. The sociopathic elite do not lack for people that will kill for them, either because of blackmail, drinking the kool aid, or Monarch. One potential security hole is better than a great many, period.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>It is easier to control the outcome of something that is fake</p>

<p>When what you are after is carnage and chaos, fine tuning isn&#39;t that necessary. And they have access to all the information needed to pick targets and plan accordingly.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Obviously, anyone would rather be guilty if found out of planning a hoax than committing actual mass murder. So much less risk in not killing people.</p>

<p>Again, not even close. Worst case, they pass it off as the actions of some rogue element or agency. This becomes much MUCH harder to do with the level of complicity required in a full-fledged hoax. Either way, if they were caught red handed at either thing, you&#39;d have people in the street in a big way so it&#39;s a moot point. They do not plan to be caught. </p>

<p>Wrong a third time. I actually don&#39;t know what you&#39;re talking about because yes, they obviously would be guilty of conspiring to murder rather than just a hoax in that case. </p>

<p>And of course you can&#39;t even address why none of these cases have any shred of evidence of real death or grief, but that&#39;s because I&#39;m familiar with these cases and you are not.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok if you hire one guy to go on a killing spree, yes that&#39;s just one guy. Now what about the crisis actors who pretend to be grieving families? Think that struggling actors would be more likely to participate in a fake scam or a real mass murder?</p>

<p>This is not an argument.</p>

<p>Not faking the false flag is far less complex and dangerous from an operational security perspective because you only have one exposed asset, who creates genuine grieving families so no need for actors. And the script nearly always has the asset suicide by cop, no loose ends.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Translation: revolving clickbait/exaggeration</p>

<p>Click on &quot;false flag,&quot; and get &quot;it didn&#39;t happen exactly like the official story. There were a couple of minor differences from the official story, like they demo&#39;d WTC7 after all the people left, and then didn&#39;t tell the public. Fire Departments typically have the power to demolish any building they want after getting certain levels of consent, including the building owner. The reason stems from the experience of unsuccessfully fighting the great historical city fires including London, Chicago, and San Francisco.</p>

<p>Alternative: </p>

<p>Massive exaggeration, such as the planes weren&#39;t planes, they were missiles, or something else. Huge promise, little or no payoff.</p>

<p>Reality: 9/11 happened exactly like the official story except some Saudi private citizens and others were more involved than the official story told, WTC 7 may have been demo&#39;d after all the people were evacuated, and the attackers were aided with a massive intelligence breach (espionage) tipping off Al Qaeda to attack on a day when US forces were engaged in distracting exercises, and the only fighter aircraft ready to be scrambled on the eastern seaboard were not loaded with anti-air missiles. </p>

<p>I would strongly support additional investigations into 9/11. I think they had over 10 investigations into Pearl Harbor. Go big. </p>

<p>One of the fallacies I see committed by conspiracy theorists over and over relates to experience. OK, the building falling doesn&#39;t seem right to you. Are you experienced in building demolition? In fighting fires? OK, if you are, have you ever built two 110 story buildings (glass on the outside, different architecture than the Empire State Building) as test models next to each other and then slammed large aircraft (test models) into them at high speed loaded with fuel, and tested what happened? </p>

<p>No, because what happened on 9/11 was a completely unique situation. Let&#39;s hope it remains that way.</p>

<p>And by the way, you don&#39;t need to melt steel to reduce its load strength. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;ve got to be kidding me.  You think Building 7 was legitimately rigged for demolition, in one afternoon, while it was still on fire?  Really?</p>

<p>Look, bub, I know <em>for a fact</em> from my own personal experience that US Army Intelligence not only had foreknowledge of the attacks of 9/11, weeks ahead of time, but acted to maximize their benefits once the attacks occurred.  That&#39;s at a bare minimum.  And it&#39;s been confirmed.</p>

<p>Recognizing that tiny fact, at the time, has helped me to travel down the most ridiculous rabbit hole of nonsense over the past fifteen years.  It&#39;s the same rabbit hole that people like Alex Jones have been in.  Because it&#39;s just reality.  And there are dozens of such conspiracies and events that are all connected, and all equally contrived and exploited for similarly nefarious purposes, in reality.</p>

<p>Not everyone here is just some random anon picking apart news reports and making Youtube videos.  Attempting to lecture and gaslight those of us who are more directly involved, who therefore see a much larger picture, just makes you look desperate and ill-informed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Excellent point. I started doing that way back in high school. </p>

<p>Many people think that the true definition of anarchy is chaos. It&#39;s rather, a decentralized form of government. It doesn&#39;t mean lawless. Such as, Monarchy is a government with a king. Theocracy is a government headed by God. Or the clergy actually. In ancient Israel we have a perfect example of a theocracy until the advent of Saul who became the first king. After that it was more properly defined as a Monarchy. Today, people tend to imagine an anarchy as lawless because society is brainwashed to believe we must have a strong central government rather than a republic based on rule of law. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Quite right. A decentralized government can&#39;t have an agenda because it has limited power. Power over one man, perhaps that falls afoul of local people. Then move. That&#39;s why I am much more concerned with national laws than local laws. National standards are great. But a powerful national government is dangerous. If power hungry people get in charge, they can have large effects you can&#39;t escape from. A large agenda that envelopes everyone. That&#39;s not liberty. It&#39;s tyranny. These Alphabet agencies of the CIA, FBI, NSA, EPA are a fire which can get out of control and instead of serving and protecting the people, can do them great harm. We see that now. IRS targeting conservative groups is a prime example of this. National health care is another one. </p>

<p>What they mean is if Seth Rich&#39;s murder was hoaxed or a HOAX - then blah blah etc. His murder doesnt fit the definition for a false flag, whether it was hoaxed or real...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks so much. Highly interesting and goes to support the doctor&#39;s statement on 4chan. When you see this, and then read the doctor&#39;s report, of course it seems much more plausible that he did not have fatal wounds. People don&#39;t realize that without medical treatment, if there&#39;s no serious internal bleeding, a person can live quite a while with a gut shot. Long enough to die later of infection.  And what of the autopsy report? Why has this not been made public or at least reported on? Another thing, did you see the video of Seth&#39;s parents and his brother talking about it? Their reactions are very strange. Is Seth actually dead? They certainly don&#39;t act like it. His brother can barely contain his glee and giggles. That behavior is shocking. I detest my brother. I wouldn&#39;t even be particularly grieved if he was killed. I would be saddened to a point because even my asshole brother doesn&#39;t deserve to be murdered. And if he was I would be sad and disturbed. No way would I be stifling a giggle or smirking. What&#39;s up there? Was Seth even killed? Or did his brother have something to do with it. The family seems dysfunctional in a way I can&#39;t put my finger on. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>One thing I think EVERYBODY can agree on - conspiracy theorists and normies alike - is the DC police department &quot;Dropped the ball&quot; early on in the investigation (that&#39;s being nice about it, in reality they stonewalled the investigation and quickly gave up without continuing to help Seth&#39;s parents in any way.)</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been able to glean more info out of his neighbors just by surfing the internet, than the cops ever bothered to do! It&#39;s sad. </p>

<p>As for his family. I have a few different trains of though I&#39;m entertaining with that.... </p>

<p>His bro looked goofy like maybe that&#39;s just how he looks when he&#39;s trying not to cry. It seems likely to me that he and his mother are both on some type of pills - no offense to her but she strikes me as the self-medicating type (rx meds +alcohol) -- with a doctor who has a loose wrist when it comes to writing scripts. She reminds me of my mom&#39;s ex-girlfriend&#39;s mom... Pill poppin&#39;, well-meaning tho oft-drunk lady who kept a very nice double wide manufactured home. With an industrial sized ziploc bag full of every type of benzo and muscle relaxer known to man, and she and her daughter were both like this and the family doctor was largely to blame for allowing it. She reminds me a LOT of her. This might be the dysfunction you&#39;re sensing.</p>

<p>So just maybe, he took some of mom&#39;s pills to be relaxed before the interview, who knows. We don&#39;t know these people. Some people are just weird. Another thing is, I think Seth&#39;s family might be one of those families that America never sees. Nebraskans. Like wtf is Nebraska, forgot that place existed. If you watch it his brother never actually cracks up he&#39;s just doing weird things with his mouth and looks pilled out.</p>

<p>Also, supposing we aren&#39;t just mistaking his expressions and he really was on the verge of snickering, I revert back to the theory that perhaps he was on pills. And/or Perhaps he was nervous, and to not cry on camera he thought of something funny between him and Seth just before the interview to keep him from crying? They mention something about Seth wanting people to smile and be happy. In short: hicks. Whatdya expect?</p>

<p>I think he was killed, maybe en route to hospital or at hostpital. Only fact is MPD is actively hindering the investigation. </p>

<p>Not to mention the Police Chief&#39;s resignation to go work for the NFL (After years of DC police service!) just 1 month after Seth&#39;s death, is not a coincidence. Mayor was out of town the day he was killed too, for whatever that&#39;s worth. </p>

    <div class="md"><p><a href="https://youtu.be/9mEu22KJjtU">https://youtu.be/9mEu22KJjtU</a>  Here&#39;s the body language report by Bombard. She goes over what she is seeing. </p>

<p>Notice. Seth&#39;s brother is RESPONDING to what his mother is saying. It&#39;s a genuine response. It&#39;s not something he is doing internally to distract himself. He IS stifling a giggle when his mom describes the injuries. At no point does anyone address Seth Rich as being dead or express any sorrow. None of them do. </p>

<p>By the way, Nebraskans are not hicks. Some of the most intelligent people are farmers. It&#39;s amazingly complex to be a farmer. You must be a business person for one. Documents and papers. Records and taxes. To be a farmer requires an education. You are not looking at farmer hicks here. These people don&#39;t work for a living. </p>

<p>I grew up in Nebraska. Most of my child hood was spent in the country. No way would a &quot;country hick&quot; act like these people. And look at the wall behind them. They are OBSESSED with make believe world. Yes, there is something wrong with these people. But it&#39;s not because they live in Nebraska. More like they live in denial. The father can&#39;t even bring himself to a conclusion that his son died. neither can the mother and from her statements it&#39;s possible she saw the body. So why is the brother stifling a giggle as his mother describes the injuries on his brother&#39;s body? At no point does he speak or show any sorrow. Pure dry eyes. After the death of my daughter I couldn&#39;t talk about her without choking up. Even now I get angry at the way she was treated by her mother and step father. So what&#39;s going on here. The mother and father seem oblivious to the loss of their son. Like it&#39;s someone else&#39;s child they are discussing. The brother seems to be suppressing glee. </p>

<p>She does mention something like this. So that&#39;s a given. </p>

<p>I didn&#39;t know about ABC studio being owned by Disney or that&#39;s where they were. Bombard also mentions this. Kind of odd for the studio to do an interview with that background for such a somber piece. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Stifling a giggle could be stifling a cry? I don&#39;t know, I&#39;ve never seen him before. It&#39;s unusual, yes, but not so hard to believe coming from a potentially pilled out kid and his pilled out mom..</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Maybe. His reaction was in timing with his mother&#39;s description of the injuries on Seth&#39;s body. I find that interesting. But his other body language during the stifled response was one of mirth. Stifling a sob, well you have to have a sob response. He shows NONE of that. Sobbing is not particular to one person or another. It&#39;s universal. There are universal constants to body language. Mirth, anger, sorrow, all these are basic emotions with built in mechanisms. That&#39;s why they are easy to spot. Deception is not built in. That&#39;s why it&#39;s harder to spot and you need to look for &quot;tells&quot;. BTW, there&#39;s no deception in any of that family that either I or Bombard can see. It&#39;s just not there. Now that I see another video of the mother and father speaking I get a better sense of their baseline responses. Yes, the mother is very adept at covering her grief. She lets it out here but recovers quickly. The father, shows almost no grief. I would have loved to see him in a happier time before the death of his son. I really think they are a bit naive. I certainly think poor Seth was naive. If indeed he was the &quot;leaker&quot; then he must have been monumentally naive to think that he would not be found out and dealt with in a rough fashion. </p>

<p>I look at all the facts in the case and refuse to discount any information. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve not heard of an autopsy report. That&#39;s troubling. Cause of death is the most important item there. It&#39;s missing. </p>

<p>The eyewitness to the police is highly important. He was walking. Talking. He didn&#39;t know he was shot. This is quite in line with what I know about being shot. You don&#39;t at first always feel the pain. It takes about half an hour or so. And sometimes longer or not at all. A bullet wound can be painless. Mine certainly was as I didn&#39;t even know I had been shot with a .44, magnum hollow point out of a Black Hawk Ruger. Just left a huge vacated hollow in the fat under my skin and tore out a fist sized hunk of hamburger meat. You could have made a decent burger from what was ejected. </p>

<p>The caliber of the weapon has never been discussed. That&#39;s troubling but then police might want to not publish that data. </p>

<p>No CCTV camera footage is released from the area of the murder. </p>

<p>Time of death? I&#39;ve not heard the actual time. </p>

<p>So he was shot around 4 am. Taken to hospital where he was operated on and stabilized in preparation for further procedures. </p>

<p>Only the one doctor&#39;s report on 4chan. Some discount that because of where it was posted. I refuse to outright dismiss that report. </p>

<p>Also, the report is chock full of doctor speak and the treatment is quite perfect for the described injuries. So with that in mind, the report is quite credible. It also makes sense in light of the eyewitness report that he was ambulatory when police arrived. </p>

<p>It wasn&#39;t a robbery gone wrong. Nothing was taken. I believe he was beaten down as a message. </p>

<p>Donna Brazile shows up? He worked for Donna? Amazing. She is a known liar and has done so on camera. I&#39;d trust 4Chan way sooner than I would trust anything she had to say on any topic. </p>

<p>The Republican who spoke for the family, he didn&#39;t outright lie. He didn&#39;t need to. He was acting. His body language is all wrong for what he is saying. But he wasn&#39;t outright lying. He was hiding something. What that I can&#39;t know. That&#39;s all I have. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>False flag in my opinion is not just about framing a country. It starts by people who have knowledge of impending attack stopping their fellow countrymen from defending or stopping attack upon their country. </p>

<p>Example.</p>

<p>If the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbour was known beforehand as people claim, it wasn&#39;t that U.S., the illuminati, Walk Street, or other power behind the throne in the United States ordered the Japanese command to attack. Rather the Roosevelt administration stopped others distributing knowledge about the Japanese attack and therefore stopped them from defending Pearl Harbour and the U.S..</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This definition is the perfect definition for r/conspiracy. It gives certain users the right to define anything and everything as a false flag, which gives them the same power as their government - to define the narrative in whatever way they so choose. My belief is that to live a normal life while having an open-mind toward conspiracy theories, one needs to be able to disconnect each theory from another instead of being the kind of conspiracy theorist who wants a binding model that all of the larger conspiracies fit into, otherwise they became mad with the anti-power of the conspiracy and start spinning anything and everything as just another conspiracy. It&#39;s like I was saying the other day, r/conspiracy always wants more proof, just as long as the amount of evidence they need to offer for their counter-arguments is in the region of zero. </p>

<p>You can see it in the way r/conspiracy has been quietly taken over in the last year. Suddenly, everything is being dragged down into the realms of conspiracy. It&#39;s the perfect tactic to discredit all the true conspiracies, by ensuring that every little thing is treated as a conspiracy. It simultaneously discredits AND misdirects. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>And &#39;Conspiracy Theory&#39; does NOT mean &#39;untrue&#39;. It means a theory as to how a conspiracy transpired, the constituents, etc...</p>

<p>It is funny how almost the whole of math and science is based on theory, but apply that to geopolitics, history,  and global affairs, and magically tptb try to falsely make the words theory and theorist mean false and kookoo.</p>

<p>Definition of conspiracy:
plural conspiracies
1
:  the act of conspiring together They were accused of conspiracy to commit murder.
2
a :  an agreement among conspirators uncovered a conspiracy against the government
b :  a group of conspirators a conspiracy made up of disgruntled aristocrats</p>

<p>Definition of theory
plural theories
1
:  a plausible or scientifically acceptable general principle or body of principles offered to explain phenomena the wave theory of light
2
a :  a belief, policy, or procedure proposed or followed as the basis of action her method is based on the theory that all children want to learn
b :  an ideal or hypothetical set of facts, principles, or circumstances —often used in the phrase in theory in theory, we have always advocated freedom for all
3
a :  a hypothesis assumed for the sake of argument or investigation
b :  an unproved assumption :  conjecture
c :  a body of theorems presenting a concise systematic view of a subject theory of equations
4
:  the general or abstract principles of a body of fact, a science, or an art music theory
5
:  abstract thought :  speculation
6
:  the analysis of a set of facts in their relation to one another</p>

<p>While yes, it CAN mean an unproved assumption or speculation, the most common definition of a theory is &quot;:  a plausible or scientifically acceptable general principle or body of principles offered to explain phenomena &quot;</p>

<p>So the net time you hear someone say or read it written, &quot;this is real, not conspiracy theory&quot; correct the person.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for posting this OP, it is an important thing for us all to read and reflect upon. Some of the most important examples of this only change a single variable, small lies are easy to keep track of.</p>

<p>An example is Pearl Harbor. The Japanese attacked the military base in retaliation for an oil embargo they saw as unfair and the attack caught the forces stationed at the base completely by surprise. All of these elements are true but recent study into the topic has led many historians to believe that the Roosevelt administration had foreknowledge of this attack as they had cracked Japanese codes the previous year and had used them to make various decisions but, seeking entry into world war 2 in a nation still weary from the first, allowed the strike to happen unimpeded choosing only to remove the truly essential assets from the area. It worked like a charm and the US joined the war.</p>

<p>Though not exactly a false flag it shows why we should be skeptical of any narrative justifying military, extreme diplomatic, or oppressive economic consequences.</p>

<p>A false flag is when a group attacks something while pretending to be another group. </p>

<p>IE a British war ship attacks a Portugeuse Warship while flying a French flag to discredit the French. </p>

<p>So it&#39;s actually neither of the things you described. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>For sure, and it&#39;s very effective. This is my best guess on the flat earth thing, and likely the origin of a few of the 9/11 theories (but honestly I couldn&#39;t tell you which ones.)</p>

<p>I think it has something to do with the psychology of a lot of conspiracy theorists. It&#39;s a pretty diverse group to be sure, but I think we have a tendency to <em>want</em> to believe the worst possible take on something. It&#39;s natural; we want to be vindicated, and the worse the real story is, the more &quot;right&quot; we are and the more &quot;wrong&quot; the official narrative is. There&#39;s also a peer pressure of sorts to believing in more &quot;out-there&quot; or &quot;anti-mainstream&quot; views, a sort of street cred that one &quot;has swallowed more red pills&quot; or isn&#39;t afraid to dig deeper. </p>

<p>I think these are somewhat natural tendencies, but we have to combat them—both in ourselves and our &quot;community.&quot; Fearlessly pursuing the truth is a good thing, but when we choose to believe an idea simply because it is more counter-narrative, we open ourselves up to preyed upon by disinfo peddlers, whether trolls, shills, or operatives. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;ve got to be kidding me.  You think Building 7 was legitimately rigged for demolition, in one afternoon, while it was still on fire?  Really?</p>

<p>Look, bub, I know <em>for a fact</em> from my own personal experience that US Army Intelligence not only had foreknowledge of the attacks of 9/11, weeks ahead of time, but acted to maximize their benefits once the attacks occurred.  That&#39;s at a bare minimum.  And it&#39;s been confirmed.</p>

<p>Recognizing that tiny fact, at the time, has helped me to travel down the most ridiculous rabbit hole of nonsense over the past fifteen years.  It&#39;s the same rabbit hole that people like Alex Jones have been in.  Because it&#39;s just reality.  And there are dozens of such conspiracies and events that are all connected, and all equally contrived and exploited for similarly nefarious purposes, in reality.</p>

<p>Not everyone here is just some random anon picking apart news reports and making Youtube videos.  Attempting to lecture and gaslight those of us who are more directly involved, who therefore see a much larger picture, just makes you look desperate and ill-informed.</p>

<p>Appreciate it, as that&#39;s exactly what it was. It&#39;s ridiculous how many downvotes you get whenever your start raising questions about Sandy Hook, yet no one will ever try to rationally argue why they don&#39;t believe it was a conspiracy. Instead, you just get lame ass ad hominem attacks and MSM talking points, which then get 10+ upvotes even if it&#39;s deep in a thread. Without fail.</p>
