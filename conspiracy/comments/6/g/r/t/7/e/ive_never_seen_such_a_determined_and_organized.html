<p>Who is a liberal?   I guess Howard Zinn or Gore Vidal.   The people in the democratic party aren&#39;t.   The Berkely crybabies who would rather have Pence aren&#39;t.   Liberalism has been destroyed,  there is no such thing anymore.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Religion gets bent to the whims of warlords. Warlords, gangsters, CEOs, politicians, chiefs. The smart manipulators among us use whatever means they can to get large groups of people to do their bidding. And there&#39;s no shortage of idiots willing to believe some bunk shit just to feel like they&#39;re part of an exclusive group. Like chocolate and peanut butter. </p>

<p>But you think it&#39;s all about the &quot;zionists&quot;. Well if that makes you feel better. It doesn&#39;t actually clarify anything about financial relationships or people occupying positions of power or why decisions get made beyond considerations of national borders. It underdetermines what you&#39;re looking for.</p>

<p>So are multiple members of an administration resigning or being fired for hiding ties to foreign governments, and no there wasn&#39;t a honeymoon with Obama, Fox and the republicans went on the offensive immediately.</p>

<p>Bullshit. Here is how Fox News and Co &quot;reported&quot; and the first 100 days of Obama:</p>

<p>You have everything. From calling Obama a fascist, socialist, communist, Manchurian candidate, atheist and secret Muslim who was born in Kenya and will destroy the US and turn it to the USSR, deathcamps for the elder, FEMA camps for conservatives. Impeachment calls a month in .... everything. And at that time Fox News already had a market share of almost 50%.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No there is no liberal media, take that from someone who has gone back and read and listened to old liberal media offerings.  </p>

<p>I would venture to guess  you don&#39;t know what a liberal talk or written message would look like but someone told you those two very old time establishment organizations, NY Times, long called &quot;the old grey lady,&quot; and the Washington Post even more conservative and now owned by Jeff Bezos with a Reagan man as Publisher are not and never have been liberal.  </p>

<p>The new York Times was forced into an ownership reorganization  during 2011 that made it not only more conservative but expanded the libertarian Tea Party voice. That is the same year of the forced sale of Washington post to libertarian Jeff Bezos. </p>

<p>Just because you have been told they are liberal doesn&#39;t mean they are. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>In a modern American political context the term &quot;liberal&quot; is often used as a synonym for progressive or left-wing. If you want to get explicit then you should strive to clarify whether you&#39;re using liberal in the classical sense from the 17th century, or whether you&#39;re referring to modern liberals in America, or if you&#39;re targeting the progressive versus the neoliberal wing of the Democratic party.</p>

<p>You don&#39;t have to, but it would certainly make things a lot clearer. Usually people who say things like &quot;the MSM is liberal&quot; lump everything together and don&#39;t give two shits about classical liberalism versus modern progressives.</p>

<p>No, that&#39;s not at all &quot;just like any party on the other side does.&quot; You literally said Obama had a &quot;sunshine period&quot; which describes the exact opposite of what you&#39;re now saying. Do you even understand your own argument? </p>

<p>It isn&#39;t the media treatment that has created the public perception of Trump, I hate to break this to you. Trump&#39;s own home state hates him and voted overwhelmingly against him, and you can&#39;t blame that on &quot;the media.&quot; </p>

<blockquote>

<p>Shows like that have <em>always</em> done what they are doing. Trump is just giving them too much to work with. No other president has done horribly embarrassing shit like Trump does on a weekly basis.</p>

<p>At this point for Obama they were calling him a &quot;rich elite&quot; who isn&#39;t &quot;one of you&quot; on Fox News because he got fucking Dijon mustard with his cheeseburger.  </p>

<p>At this point there were people like Glenn Beck and Donald Trump saying Obama wasn&#39;t even a citizen. </p>

<p>You can&#39;t be serious with all this. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Chris Hedges was right.  Long before the election, he was asked on the &quot;Democracy Now!&quot; daily news program, which candidate would be better for the people of the world: CIA-supporting Hillary Clinton (who, for example, supported the CIA&#39;s desire for a &quot;No-Fly-Zone&quot; in Syria and supported an expansion of NATO arms sales to new markets) or CIA-criticizing and NATO-wary candidate Donald Trump?   When Chris Hedges was asked who would be better for the world, Hedges said it won&#39;t matter.  Neither candidate would be able to alter the course of the Deep State, and of course, Hillary openly supported the CIA / Deep State.  </p>

<p>Trump tried bucking the CIA and Deep State at first, but they bent him to their will.  Not that I&#39;m a fan of Trump.  Only the Green Party&#39;s candidate would have been honest enough, clean enough, and determined enough to take back our country from the CIA / Deep State&#39;s henchmen.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>JFK was killed because he pissed off George Bush Sr who was running the whole Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba by CIA backed &quot;rebels&quot; (he even named one of the landing ships the &quot;barbara&quot;). JFK cancelled their air support for the beach landing on the day of the action, and the CIA&#39;s pets all got killed and/or arrested by the cubans. the CIA wanted revenge.</p>

<p>this is why George Bush was in Dallas that day. he says he wasn&#39;t, <a href="http://www.whatreallyhappened.com/RANCHO/POLITICS/JFK/BushJfkBookDepo2.jpg">but there are pictures...</a>. </p>

<p>E Howard Hunt was a CIA pal of GWB Sr. and was one of the operatives who worked with him handling the cuban &quot;rebels&quot; during the Bay of Pigs action. he was also one of the &quot;tramps&quot; arrested in dallas that morning (the other was Frank Sturgis). he was ALSO one of the guys who broke into the Watergate hotel, supposedly to plant wires, but some say it was because there was proof there that placed him at dallas when JFK was killed and threatened to blow it all up. </p>

<p>in the &quot;smoking gun&quot; Nixon tape (talking about the watergate break in), Nixon says &quot;Hunt knows too much...it&#39;s likely to blow the whole Bay of Pigs thing which we think would be very unfortunate for CIA and the country at this time, and for American foreign policy.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="http://www.whatreallyhappened.com/RANCHO/POLITICS/JFK/OSWALD/Oswald%20CIA.pdf">Oswald was CIA (see this FBI Memo)</a>: &quot;Oswald subject was trained by this agency, under cover of the Office of Naval Intelligence, for Soviet assignments&quot;</p>

<p>Hunt confessed to all of this on his deathbed, and was recorded by his son.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marita_Lorenz#JFK_conspiracy_allegations">Marita Lorenz testified under oath</a> that she met Oswald in the fall of 1963 at an Operation 40 safe house in the Little Havana section of Miami. According to Lorenz, she met him again before the Kennedy assassination in 1963 in the house of Orlando Bosch, with Frank Sturgis, Pedro Luis Díaz Lanz, and two other Cubans present. She said the men studied Dallas street maps and that she suspected that they were planning on raiding an arsenal. Lorenz stated that she joined the men traveling to Dallas in two cars and carrying &quot;rifles and scopes&quot;, but flew back to Miami the day after they arrived. </p>

<p>her testimony was deemed &quot;unreliable&quot; by the House Select Committee on the assassination. </p>

<p>Kennedy died because he pissed of George Bush, Sr. </p>

<p>George Bush Sr. was at the center of all the shady bullshit going on in the US for the last half of the 20th century. from CIA operative, to CIA Director, to the Man Behind the Throne during the Reagan administration, to his own presidency. had ties to the Clintons because they covered for the Iran-Contra drug running BS through the Mena, AR airport while they were in power there...then Back to controlling the white house through his boy Jr.  </p>

<p>IMO, he is/was the most dangerous person in the western hemisphere.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Realy great info.  Thank you very much.  I especially enjoyed reading CIA Director McCone&#39;s memo to the Secret Service about how Oswald had been trained by and worked for the CIA as early as the 1950s.  </p>

<p>I had read Hoover&#39;s 1950s or early 1960s FBI memo about &quot;George Bush of the CIA,&quot; but this is the first I&#39;ve seen of the CIA memo about Oswald.  In the book &quot;A Heritage of Stone,&quot; Jim Garrison connects Oswald to the intelligence community, but that memo must have been still secret at the time.  Do you know when the McCone CIA memo was declassified and released?  I&#39;m guessing it was part of the trove of documents declassified in the 1990s under the Assassination Records Review Board (ARRB)?</p>

<p>Also of note is Kennedy signing Executive Order 11110 curtailing the power of the Rothschild&#39;s from their private ownership of the Federal Reserve and issuing real money from the US Treasury. His nosing into Dimona Nuke facility in Israel, and promising to &quot;Break up the CIA into 1,000 pieces and scatter it to the wind&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Didn&#39;t plan on him winning? Man, that&#39;s an understatement, they shit all over him and relentlessly trashed him six ways from Sunday, and a character like Trump simply doesn&#39;t sit still for that. If he had I, then I would have said he was a puppet. No Trump is Trump is and has stayed true to his character, such as it is. He&#39;s always had an enormous ego and has always been an outspoken critic of virtually all of the US presidents or government polices at one time or another. Of course everyone has ideas about what would and could make things better but the reality is that it&#39;s a huge and unwieldy bureaucratic monstrosity that is directed and controlled by competing interests that are all chasing after as much money as they can get and if they don&#39;t actually have any real reasons they&#39;ll work and connive to create some that will warrant giving them more.</p>

The CIA are arms dealers, along with being drug dealers/traffickers.  I read or heard somewhere that the CIA gets kickbacks everytime arms sales are made to the Saudis and other nations.

<p>As for either man&#39;s &quot;sexploits&quot; they were both charming, handsome, intelligent, and very sophisticated men and even without the political power and fame all kinds of women including a lots of highly attractive ones were always interested in them.

<p>I don&#39;t believe what we&#39;re seeing about Trump in the national media is a giant astroturfing campaign.  That would be a small group of people trying to get out a propagandist message that appears to originate in grassroots outrage or response.  But business is <em>not</em> going on as usual, Trump&#39;s administration is bizarre and dysfunctional in ways not seen for a very long time.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>As unsexy as this theory is, it makes a hell of a lot of sense. It would account for the gunfire sound and smell of gunpowder that people reported near the motorcade, the unlikely trajectory of the bullet, the suspicious actions following the assassination (military guys in the autopsy, removal of the body from Texas, etc.) It&#39;s definitely the Occam&#39;s Razor theory of choice in my mind. </p>

<p>For anyone not aware of this theory, it proposes that Oswald actually did shoot from the book depository and in the commotion a Secret Service agent riding on the car accidentally discharged his weapon inadvertently killing the President, and that the Secret Service conspired to cover up the blunder after the fact. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah did it not claim the agents were blind drunk the night before then one of them accidentally fired while sweating the booze out and trying to keep upright or something.</p>

<p>I liked that theory actually, it cracked me up. The reason it was covered up was because god forbid the rest of the world&#39;s government&#39;s see that the CIA were so incompetent that a hungover agent accidentally killed the president.</p>

Please choose between August douche and a turd sandwich. We picked turd sandwich this time is all. I honestly don&#39;t think they needed to fake anything to discredit him is all, this is business as usual for Trump. Argue all you want that they are faking this shot to smear him, but we&#39;re talking about Amman who supported Hillary for years before the election and right up until he announced his run.

    <div class="md"><p>You didn&#39;t mention anything about HRC because you don&#39;t really know what Citizens United is about. This sub pretty vehemently hates Clinton. Citizens United created a documentary aimed at then Senator Clinton during the 2008 race, and ran ads to urge others to order it on-demand to watch.</p>

<p>The outcome of the case after reaching the Supreme Court was that the Government may not suppress political speech on the basis of the speaker’s corporate identity. Banning all corporations from political speech is too broad anyway, and the reasoning for the ban, that &#39;corporations are good at making money so lets not let them use it&#39; is insufficient reasoning. </p>

<p>PS. Media outlets are corporations too... So all these media outlets, newspapers, etc. etc. would be banned from running ads or publishing content, for example, of speaking out against a candidate during election time. I sure do bet Hillary wished Citizens United was gone too, because she would&#39;ve won the damned Presidency.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>The March “Cold Case Posse” investigation of Barack Obama’s birth certificate conducted by Arizona sheriff Joe Arpaio produced no new evidence demonstrating that document to be a forgery; that entity’s report by Mara Zebest simply recycled old arguments that had long since been thoroughly debunked in detail. Likewise, a July 2012 announcement from Sheriff Arpaio repeated more rumors that had already been debunked.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s all they&#39;ve written in response to the investigators video and points of evidence. They provide no examples, no external sources. You&#39;re simply taking their word without even watching the sheriff&#39;s video in the first place. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>they source and link their claims that debunk your nonsense</p>

<p>No, they didn&#39;t. A single paragraph of writing on the matter is not &quot;sourcing and linking&quot; </p>

<p>Comey acknowledged under oath that the NYT published a completely fabricated story about Trump/Russia.  Considering the world-wide credibility that the NYT carries, that should greatly concern everyone. </p>

<p>Either the NYT made up the story to attack Trump, or the intelligence community leaked false information to a journalist to mislead them.  But, considering they said multiple sources confirmed it, it seems likely that it&#39;s some combination of the two.  Whether you like Trump or not, we should be really leary of cheering on an intelligence apparatus that is lying to undermine an elected president.</p>

<p>and the story comey was specifically talking about:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/14/us/politics/russia-intelligence-communications-trump.html?_r=0">https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/14/us/politics/russia-intelligence-communications-trump.html?_r=0</a></p>

<p>and NY Times says they stand behind their reporting at the time as multiple sources confirmed it. </p>

<p>So either </p>

<ul>
<li>Comey is lying about it being false</li>
<li>NYT is lying about sources telling them the information was true, and/or multiple sources confirming it</li>
<li>The sources that told them it were lying</li>
</ul>

<p>I don&#39;t know if there&#39;s another alternative that I&#39;m not considering..</p>

<p>Alternatively, can you imagine what they would have done if Obama had acted like Trump? Nepotism, violating emoluments, the Russia stuff, the gaffes. Or even if he had just shared Trump&#39;s history of three ex wives with a string of kids and a tendency to not pay his bills?</p>

<p>Nepotism like giving Biden&#39;s son a ton of Ukraine contracts.</p>

<p>Pretty sure every President has violated emoluments by the degree you can argue Trump has.</p>

<p>The gaffes &quot;if if if if if if they cling to their guns and religion&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Absolutely, If the MSM had been all over Bengazhi the way they have been &quot;Fake News&quot; and the Russia conspiracy, Obama would have been unable to beat Romney. Bengazhi and the order to &quot;stand down&quot; happened on the anniversary of 9/11 which was practically 2 months before the election. The MSM worked hand in hand with the Obama Administration to push the YouTube video as fact when they knew it was a lie. They went so far as Cathy Crowley correcting Romney in the middle of a televised debate. Where were the CIA and FBI sources then (the same sources sworn to secrecy) who go out of their way to leak unsubstantiated innuendo and rumors and the MSM print as fact.</p>

<p>The difference is in the MSM . These allegations were made for sure (by FOX) but the rest of main stream Media defended each and every one of these things. They countered them and painted them to be the smear campaign they were. They also whitewash and ignore certain stories favoring this ongoing tit-for-tat infighting between the 2 parties. In other words, they refuse to cover other candidates and promote only the 2 party leaders. Seems they only cover other party&#39;s candidates when the public forces them to. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>How much of the FNC stuff was filling the 24 hour news cycle? We know crazies are out there and I remember FNC looking hard for what controversy they could. I recall a bit about the Japanese but the bowing to the Saudi King set that meme off. Since 11/08/16 it has looked, to me anyway, more like a concerted effort to delegitimize the current Administration. It didn&#39;t take long for &quot;not my President&quot; to show up or for hidden forces to orchestrate the women&#39;s march on the same day as the inauguration. And on and on (it took less than eight months to write, fund, cast and rehearse a play which depicts Trumps assassination? Come on.</p>

<p>In my little mind I see this as an all out war being waged by and the coordination funded by one person, George Soros. He has the where with all, he has the desire and we can damn well bet that no one in the MSM will either investigate or report on any activities perpetrated by this man. They pretty well took care of accusations of his organizing the disruptions at Trump rallies with the whole &quot;fake news&quot; canard.</p>

<p>I do think that President Trump comes off as unhinged and overly sensitive at times. I do wish he would stop with the Twitter rants (though I can understand his believing that that is the only way he can get his message out to the people) because the whole Twitter thing comes off as incoherent and sad, imho. (oh, and I agree with Conan) </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The level of hatred is not even close to the same.  I&#39;m very neutral politically and I was during Obama&#39;s campaigns and terms.  From a neutrals viewpoint it&#39;s literally day and night difference.  The few people that went against Obama were shut down totally in the press.  The press is leading the charge against Trump with lies and manipulation every single day since he started running and 100 times worse once Trump got into office.  If you can&#39;t see it take off your Trump hating goggles for a minute. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You bring up 2 points that were constantly being belitttled and shut down in rhe press the moment they showed up.  Take a moment and turn on ABC, CBS, NBC, bbq, sky news, or any msm... And time how long before the spin shows up against Trump.  I promise if we did the same experiment 8 yrs ago it would be eye opening to you.  </p>

<p>Again, im neutral so I see the deception on both sides since im not being dragged along by my own biases.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Being neutral as you say you are, insert the name of any of the Republicans who ran in the primaries, would you say people are being too hard them? What if Jeb Bush won and he did everything that Trump has done, do you think the MSM would be spreading lies or would it be exposing the deep state? </p>

<p>I think this is a Trump defense and has nothing to do with political parties. Trump has convinced a certain part of the population that he is not a politician and he only has their interests in mind for all of his policies. If this same narrative surrounded any other &quot;politician&quot; they would be skewered by both sides.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The difference is competency. Being English and having lived in the US for the last 12 years, so I hope to add a different perspective. </p>

<p>It&#39;s clear the Right were clutching at any straw they could use to make Obama look bad, mostly in an ad hominem manner. This is expected with any leader who has opposition with far leaning opponents.</p>

<p>The BBC, for very explicit example, has reported on what President Trump has done with a sense of utter bewilderment, because most of what Mr Trump is doing is honestly bewildering to those of us on the outside looking, be it the national or international community. He mischaracterises just about everything he has done in international politics to the point where there is no factual information to suggest that he knows what the Paris Accord is or exactly how NATO works.</p>

<p>Now, Mr Trump has also suffered ad hominem attacks, but not just from the left and aside from the surface stuff (Mr Orange etc) that one would expect of any leader, it is mostly attacking the way he is trying to run the country and how it reflects on the international community. One that I actually found amusing was the report that he needs his name included in just about every paragraph of security notes to keep him interested. Unfortunately, once the incredulity settles down, this is as terrifying as it is scary.</p>

<p>So while there is more attacks on Mr Trump, I think it is justified, especially on a satirical level, given what the majority of them are based on.</p>

<p>RADIO was the number one source of information for some 70 years. It has only recently been passed by the internet. TV has never been close. Now here&#39;s the thing:</p>

<p>TALK RADIO IS SOME 90 PERCENT MSM.</p>

<p>Three words was enough to deduce all that?  Impressive. Anyways those who don&#39;t go out in vote are largely to blame for allowing this farce to continue so long unabated. </p>

<p>If the other half of the eligible voters actually voted we would have much more success with 3rd party candidates and get rid of the whole choosing the lesser evil excuse. </p>

<p>Anyone who does not exercise their right to vote is a part of the problem and not the solution. </p>

<p>In 28 or so years there has never been any candidates worth voting for? Like at all? Even locally?   What exactly are for and against that no candidate ever has ran on?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because this site has spent an enormous amount of time on political attacks, not how government has been taken over by those who want to harm us. </p>

<p>Like that long running attack on public funded education which included the cuts that stopped the no and low tuition state colleges from providing college education for the working classes and led to the harm to K-12 schools by handing school funds to charter schools many that while not providing an improved education are providing tax money for private profit. Including a few states who allow vouchers to be used for part of the tuition at very expensive and exclusive private schools, one of the things Betsy DeVos wants to make nationwide. </p>

<p>Yeah, it was just Fox and the far right sources when Obama was in office.

Then there were &quot;death panels,&quot; the Tea Party and their awful plan to never support anything if it raised taxes or supported Obama, Republicans saying that their number one goal after 2008 was to make Obama a one-term president, etc etc. Oh, they also manage do to do what the left has done very effectively now: make the simple addition of the president&#39;s name to something turn it instantly toxic. It&#39;s essentially Pavlovian in how quickly libs turn on something when Trump&#39;s name is attached to it, just like how reps turned sour on anything at all with Obama&#39;s name on it.

    <div class="md"><p>But what do you expect them to do? <strong>Not</strong> report on trump&#39;s various firings, gaffes, and intelligence leaks? Stories like birtherism &amp; Benghazi died because there just wasn&#39;t any evidence to keep them in the news cycle. However, the Russia investigation, while not bearing any tangible fruit of direct collusion, has its fires stoked 3x a week with new evidence, new testimony, or more Trump gaffes when he speaks about it. The president himself even seems to revel in keeping people waiting with bated breath about it. Why else would he do things like tell reporters that they&#39;ll expect an answer on WH wiretaps &quot;in the very near future&quot; instead of telling them outright? The Russian collusion conspiracy will continue until Trump decides to both stop making a total fool out of himself with regards to the investigatory process and when he stops demonizing the intelligence community. </p>

He never held a job in his life, he was president of the <em>Harvard Law Review</em> while never having published anything and none of the members of the pre-law clun ever met him, inc all the officers, who you would think would know the president of the paper they publish. he has no record from Occidental or any of the other schools he supposedly attended... then there&#39;s [this].(<a href="http://www.wnd.com/files/2012/05/120518obamKenyafull.jpg">http://www.wnd.com/files/2012/05/120518obamKenyafull.jpg</a>)</p>

<p>He ran for senator from Illinois, while not living there, and was obv chosen by dem higher-ups, since even Hillary,  birthplace Schaumberg, Illinois who had the goods on every Chicago mobster there is, was told to take a hike and had to run for senator from NY, a state she wasn&#39;t living in, and had to kill JFK, Jr to get him out of the Dem primary.</p>

However, I&#39;ve never seen such organized rebellion against a president. There are well funded groups out here whose sole job is to hate on Trump. The Obama hate seemed a bit tamer in comparison.

    <div class="md"><p>What&#39;s the wager? That &quot;people are being mean to muh Trump!&quot;?</p>

<p>I don&#39;t doubt that they are. &quot;Oh no! People are constantly making posts critical of my hero!&quot; Get over it. EVERY politician undergoes this same exact thing. Stop throwing a tantrum over it.</p>

<p>Is the wager that Obama was treated similarly or worse? If so, there&#39;s ample evidence for that because, unlike for Trump, much of the criticism against Obama was COMPLETE bullshit (ie, birth certificates, kenyan ancestry, &quot;secret muslim&quot; etc).</p>

<p>Much of the negative coverage surrounding Trump is very real and of his own doing. Did anyone FORCE him to leak news to Russians? No.</p>

<p>Did anyone FORCE Trump to fire Comey? No</p>

<p>Did anyone force Trump to hold a secret closed door meeting with the FBI director?  No</p>

<p>Did anyone force trump to mock the disabled? No</p>

<p>Did anyone force trump to lie about his crowd sizes? No</p>

<p>Did anyone force trump to campaign on &quot;drain the swamp&quot; yet, once elected, proceed to fill his cabinet with a completely pay-for-play roster? No</p>

<p>Did anyone force Trump to hire Flynn? No</p>

<p>Did anyone force Trump to hire Manafort? No</p>

<p>Did anyone force Trump to hire Carter Page? No</p>

<p>Did anyone force Trump to make that &quot;grab them by the pussy&quot; comment? No</p>

<p>Did anyone force Trump to call it a Muslim ban? No </p>

<p>Did anyone force Trump to promise us all a &quot;big beautiful wall that Mexico would pay for&quot;? No</p>

<p>Did anyone force Trump to cozy up with the Saudis despite him and his minions trashing people who did? No</p>

<p>Did anyone force Trump to call global warming a &quot;chinese manufactured conspiracy&quot;? No</p>

<p>Did anyone force Trump to hire Betsy Devos? No</p>

<p>Did anyone force Trump to bomb innocent people and American citizens in Yemen? No</p>

<p>Did anyone force Trump to call NATO &quot;obsolete&quot;? No</p>

<p>Did anyone force Trump to make a complete fool of himself in Europe? No</p>

<p>Did anyone force Trump to tweet ANYTHING? No</p>

<p>Did anyone force Trump to hire Jeff Sessions? No</p>

<p>Did anyone force Trump to defraud thousands (maybe millions) of people in his Trump University? No</p>

<p>Did anyone force Trump to be close friends with established party-planning pedophiles? No</p>

<p>Did anyone force Trump to sexually assault dozens of women? No</p>

<p>Did anyone force Trump to promise everyone he would &quot;lock her up&quot;? No</p>

<p>Did anyone force Trump to make an enemy of the free press? No</p>

<p>Did anyone force Trump to tweet about the possibility of White House tapes?</p>

<p>Did anyone force Trump to push for dismantling the EPA? National Parks? No</p>

<p>Did anyone force Trump to make ANY of the bad decisions he&#39;s made or continues to make or will make in the future? No</p>

<p>I&#39;m sorry your feelings are hurt that people are talking poorly about your hero. I really am. But it&#39;s bot undeserved and it CERTAINLY isn&#39;t &quot;the worse&quot; treatment a president has ever received. Not even close. So stop bitching and throwing a tantrum because YOUR guy can&#39;t seem to stop making a complete ass out of himself, and, by extension, all of us. </p>

<p>Most of all that is who Trump worked for with his 2012 Birther campaign and it is they who are intent on selling out your nation to

    <div class="md"><p>We were told that if Trump was elected America would be either a smouldering crater or a goose-stepping fascist dystopia where Muslims are kept in concentration camps by now, and yet seven months later the US is still pretty much the same everyday corporatist bullshit factory Obama left it. We’re all still praying for a miracle to save us from the destructive, America-despising trajectory our unelected power establishment has had our nation on, but at least we’re still in the fight. That is likely a lot more than you‘d have been able to say for a war-loving, Russia-hating strategical imbecile with no sense of responsibility for her own behavior.</p>

<p>The mass media machine is trying to force Americans to swallow the belief that they made the wrong choice in November, and that next time they’d better be more obedient and listen to the talking heads on TV. These people are lying, and they are wrong. There is no longer any valid reason to continue settling for this nation-killing oligarchic trajectory any longer. Keeping Hillary out of the White House was a good first step, but it was only a first step, the first of many necessary steps we’ll need to take to turn this thing around.</p>

<p>The establishment that was always right had spoken. Yet it kept on being embarrassingly wrong. Over and over again.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If your election system uses first past the post, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7tWHJfhiyo">it <em>will</em> devolve into two similar parties</a></p>

<p>The <em>actual</em> answer is to get rid of the first past the post election system, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y3jE3B8HsE&amp;amp;list=PL7679C7ACE93A5638&amp;amp;index=2">there are several strategies you could use.</a></p>

<p>(more than what Grey mentions, just hes a great jumping off point)</p>

<p>So the populace should be working to replace unrepresentative unfair and undemocratic electorate systems built around first past the post or winner take all with representative ones.</p>

<p>In the US, the following positions are (almost universally, with some exceptions) done in first past the post / winner take all style, and are thus ripe for reform:</p>

<ul>
<li>Mayor</li>
<li>City Council</li>
<li>Municipal Judges</li>
<li>Representatives (state or federal, house or senate)</li>
<li>President</li>
</ul>

<p>Progress is made if <em>any</em> of these elections become more representative by adopting alternative voting systems.</p>

<p>Of course, the chicken and egg problem - constitutions and charters all specify the election protocols, and to change them you need the <em>currently elected rulers</em> to make those changes. And those elected officials got into power through the current undemocratic systems. Figuring out a reliable way to change those documents for the better without a violent revolution while against the interests of those in power is an unsolved mystery of the universe.</p>

<p>I had some real trouble learning how to read as a kid (a struggle that I have worked really hard to fix) And I can tell you....this is exactly how I would have acted if I was confronted with reading in out loud. I would make excuses like &quot;Too small to read&quot; all the time, and I would stare blankly at a the material, pretending to read, when really I was just too ashamed to ask for help. Luckily I eventually asked for help and pushed through my struggle....I think Trump never asked for help...and now he&#39;s too old to ask for help. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Open dictatorship?  Interesting but completely off topic. What I&#39;m referring to is the concept of democracy and how we believe (the average American) it functions versus how it actually does function.  I believe that our government functions for the few rather than the whole. This is not conspiratorial, it&#39;s simply how our government has evolved. It is the only job in the world where you are paid roughly $140,000 per year and at the end of your 4 or 6 year term you&#39;re a multi-millionaire with a pension and health care benefits for life.  Where does all that wealth come from?  They are ALL there for themselves or those that paid millions to get them elected. The idea of civil service, depending on your population base, typically ends at the city or state level. America is an amazing country full of amazing people that are run by less than desirable individuals. Besides, you&#39;ve proven my point precisely. You&#39;re so wound up in the bullshit fed to us by any media source that you&#39;ve failed to form an opinion of your own. Instead you rail against the democrats or republicans as if that is the problem with our country. Im guessing you focus on the news service that matches your viewpoints most closely and pay little attention to anything else or entertain an original thought. You consume that which you already believe to help strengthen a belief based on fallacies. You are helping to build and feed the system that has cut middle americas pay in half, inflation adjusted, since the 70&#39;s. Where has all that wealth gone?  You don&#39;t care because you&#39;re too concerned with a game of &quot;us against them&quot; that has been created to occupy your valuable time.  The two parties are two sides of the same worthless wooden nickel. We believe the nickel is valuable because of all the strife and angst we are inundated with. It&#39;s a game, a theatrical presentation that occupies far too much of everyone&#39;s time. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Obama received an extreme level of hate almost instantly and anyone stating otherwise is completely ignorant(and likely one of the haters), Mitch McConnell stated it before he was even inaugurated.</p>

<p>The Trump hate(however deserved it may be) is taking Obamas to the next level though.  You have mainstream media outlets saying and defending things said about Trump on air/print that only the far-right fringe did to Obama.  A good portion of Trumps own party is even joining in against him, which didn&#39;t happen to Obama.</p>

<p>I say this as someone who disagrees with Trump on almost every issue.  I only wish the media treated EVERY politician in the same manner, the singling out of one person while giving the rest a pass should make everyone suspicious.</p>

Republicans attacking Obama is expected and racist nutjobs don&#39;t have nearly the same weight, nobody really listens to them even though the edit likes to amplify them for rhetorical reasons.</p>

<p>A unified legacy media against trump appears to be a new kind of propaganda machine.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I disagree to some extent.</p>

<p>I believe the legacy media intentionally publishes propaganda in an attempt to manufacture consent for an unelected power structure. </p>

<p>Much of the outrage and disdain directed at him comes consistently and directly from several highly biased and highly dishonest main stream media corporations. I believe that many of the attacks from the legacy media tend to be lying <em>more</em> than Trump does on average. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe you&#39;re not seeing the other side of the story, which is the fact that they are deliberately pushing bullshit stories, lies, distortions and program propaganda meant to make him look bad specifically for the purpose of de-legitimizing him to the public.  Maybe you don&#39;t see it, but for anybody who&#39;s been studying the media as long as I have since Bush got in and how they reacted towards both him and Obama, but the media push against Trump is completely unprecedented in scope.  Nobody can be honest and say that Clinton, Bush or Obama ever got publicly excoriated by both sides like he is.  It&#39;s blatant and obvious.</p>

<p>The fact that he tweets directly to people is kind of incredible really. How long have we been having to read what presidents say filtered through layers of opinion, sound bites and straight up lies of biased media corporations? Kind of makes you wonder how much of what other presidents have done has been hampered by having to placate these unelected power structures...</p>

<p>The Trump hate(however deserved it may be) is taking Obamas to the next level though.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not really though. You just feel that way as now it&#39;s your guy, you didn&#39;t care about how a president was treated before or weren&#39;t old enough to pay attention to it. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>You have mainstream media outlets saying and defending things said about Trump on air/print that only the far-right fringe did to Obama.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Fox News has been the biggest cable news channel for a long time. And they were the ones pushing ridiculous stories like the &quot;terrorist fist jab&quot; and &quot;president poupon&quot; nonsense. </p>

<p>When Obama was elected the right was pushing the narrative that he was a secret Kenyan Muslim out to take all of our guns, overthrow the government and claim himself emperor and declare sharia law. And yes, that was on mainstream conservative news as well. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>A good portion of Trumps own party is even joining in against him, which didn&#39;t happen to Obama.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Which goes to show you that this is Trumps own fault. This wouldn&#39;t happen with a Pence or even a Jeb because they know how to shut the fuck up and just sign the laws. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>only wish the media treated EVERY politician in the same manner, the singling out of one person while giving the rest a pass should make everyone suspicious.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What you&#39;re asking for is akin to journalistic communism. Everyone gets equal praise and condemnation even if one person is a truly horrible president and the other is pretty good. </p>

<p>Maybe start to realize that Trump gets more criticism because he does more stupid shit in 10 days than most presidents do in a whole term. </p>

<p>The other point stands, you simply weren&#39;t paying attention. As I, and several others, in this thread have nicely detailed for you. </p>

<p>You seem to have weirdly deleted that point about it being by far the most popular cable news network. Funny how you don&#39;t want to acknowledge that. </p>

<p>Or how about talk radio being all far right wing too?</p>

<p>Or shit like Drudge Report, etc which still gets millions of views. </p>

<p>Hahaha, the ONLY Fox News show which is even timidly critical is Shep Smith. &quot;Plenty&quot; is a laughable statement. </p>

<p>And Obama also got shit from the major news networks, he just wasn&#39;t rage tweeting at news programs and attacking FBI directors and foreign mayors every other day. </p>

<p>Again, it&#39;s just showing what you want is for people to ignore Trumps shit. Because HOW DARE WE acknowledge the stupid things he says and does every day. We should all just kneel down at his feet am I right?!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>No, what I&#39;m asking for is journalist integrity instead of the propaganda you love pushing as facts.</p>

<p>Journalist integrity is reporting the facts. </p>

<p>The fact is that Trump is a dumpster fire right now. He&#39;s gotten no major legislation passed with all 3 branches on his side and instead he&#39;s rage tweeting and impeding investigations. </p>

<p>As for you claiming to be liberal, great work on torpedoing climate change protections, Wall Street reforms, and civil liberties though. BUT HER EMAILLSSSSSSS. You sure showed everyone!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are clearly a disingenuous person to keep pushing bullshit after he&#39;s already corrected you.  Pointing out the very obvious anti Trump bias in the establishment does not in any way mean you support him, it means you&#39;re actually looking at things from a balanced perspective and not buying into either side of the political Kool-Aid troughs that people like you lap up gladly because it conforms to your own biases.  You can be a liberal and acknowledge the fact that the media and establishment hate Donald Trump with a passion never seen for any other President, yes, even George W. Bush, who is demonstrably <em>worse</em> on many levels but yet shockingly gets a pass from the media and even a lot of liberals <em>just</em> because he&#39;s anti-Trump.</p>

<p>It&#39;s because they took what SandersforPres figured out and took it to its logical and horrible extreme. </p>

<p>The old algorithm was heavily dependent on how many votes a post got quickly. So if you sat on new and a post quickly got 500 upvotes it would rocket to the front page. They would immediately sticky new posts to the top to abuse that. </p>

<p>Your post history leads me to believe that your bias could be seen in the same light. There were no protests, riots, etc after Obama. No meltdowns, not death threats, not mass crying for attention; people seethed for 8 years. You were clearly the one not paying attention.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Obama put his head down and did his best to run the country, never once stooping down to the level of his attackers.</p>

<p>Trump on the other hand was attacking people before he was in the running, during his campaign, and after taking office. He was relentless in his attacks and a lot of them were unwarranted. We&#39;re not even talking well planned out strategic attacks, we&#39;re talking playground insults, cheap threats, and starting blatant untruthful rumours.</p>

<p>Obama&#39;s haters hated him either because he was a democrat, what he stood for, or his race, Trump&#39;s haters hate him because he&#39;s a nasty person, period. That&#39;s why even his own corner are finding it hard to stomach him.</p>

<p>Trump has reduced the White House to laughing stock, he goes on a state visit and plays nice then comes back and talks shit about that same country, he says something one day then changes his mind the next, he criticises his predecessor for playing golf on the job and then does the same several fold,  criticises his predecessor for taking too many vacations and then takes one nearly every week in his own hotel (and makes the secret service PAY to stay in his hotel to protect him). He&#39;s even admitted that a lot of the bullshit he told his supporters was only said because he thought that&#39;s what they wanted to hear. </p>

<p>The list is never ending, Obama never had a single scandal. Even foreign countries have been reduced to going around him and dealing with states directly because he&#39;s so incompetent.</p>

<p>I&#39;m all for fair play but in my opinion he&#39;s not getting enough flak. If he actually starts taking his job seriously instead of treating it like a giant publicity stunt/game show, then I think the American people should cut him some slack for the sake of the county, until then America&#39;s future is uncertain.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Complained to YouTube about an anti-Muslim video.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2></h2>

<blockquote>
<p>Waited until after the 2012 election to release unpopular Obamacare rules.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Most of these are nitpicking at best - the kind of stuff that Trump does publicly every day and no one cares.</p>

<p>Trump fired the FBI director, brazenly tried to pass the blame onto his subordinates who refused to take it, then finally went on TV and admitted that it was because the FBI director was actually doing his job and investigating him - and you&#39;re here trying to compare that with Obama getting a movie release date wrong? The guy bragged to Russian officials that he fired Comey ffs.</p>

<p>And when will you get it into your heads that Russia is a hostile enemy? Russia has made no secret that it wants to take down America and only started playing innocent when, to the surprise of Putin, Trump supporters gave Russia the benefit of a doubt. </p>

<p>Every branch of national security implicates Russia, every allied foreign government has come to the same conclusion, even Trump&#39;s own government has come to the same conclusion... yet you choose believe Trump&#39;s word without a shred of evidence, someone who&#39;s been known to lie over the most petty of things.</p>

<p>This is why people laugh at Trump supporters, what crazy world do you live in?</p>

<p>The worst thing about all of this is that he&#39;s also screwing his supporters, but you all see this as a them vs us game, so you just blindly follow him and ignore his transgressions.</p>

<li><p>Fair enough but maybe it would be more balanced for me to say that while that was going on Obama had all of the liberal media on his side, at least half of the MSM.

<p>No manning was definitely during obama and leaked to wikileaks because of how the war was been handled by Obama.  It was used to create distrust and uncertainty in select politicians like Hillary </p>

<p>Then you have the Snowdon leaks that really made Obama look bad for allowing spying on us citizens among other terrible things.  </p>

<p>There was also a Top Secret slide leaked that detailed the drone kill chain and how it went all the way up to Obama.  Who was already getting bad press for droning the shit out of people. </p>

<p>These are the kind of things that Russia would do to try and divide America and sow distrust in its leaders.  Which I&#39;m not claiming at all as there&#39;s no proof but i did entertain the idea when Snowdon was granted asylum. </p>

<p>Your criteria for media that &quot;supports&quot; Trump is if they aren&#39;t overwhelmingly negative about him. Is that alarming to you? Is a news network that provides 50/50 positive/negative coverage biased?</p>

<p>The harvard study says Fox was 53% negative of Trump. Oh but that goes against your opinions, so therefore the harvard study must be invalid/fishy. Gotcha, I understand now.</p>

<p>They didn&#39;t include InfoWars but did include BBC and Financial Times, it looks and smells fishy to me.</p>

<p>Now do you see how ridiculous you look?</p>

<p>You can keep saying &quot;European sources&quot;, when actually it&#39;s BBC, Financial Times. They&#39;re practically world news outlets. If they didn&#39;t include non-US sources you would have said that was fishy and a &quot;stacked deck&quot;.</p>

<p>How is that a &quot;stacked deck&quot;? How does including BBC and FT at all affect the statistics for the other outlets? It doesn&#39;t. You&#39;re just grasping at straws, trying to de-legitimize a harvard study any way you can because your brain is cooked.</p>

<p>I actually can&#39;t believe you believe this. I feel so sorry for you.</p>

<p>Please, if you will, elaborate on how including those Euro sources make the study a &quot;stacked deck&quot;. I look forward to reading your ridiculous, illogical explanation.</p>

<p>So there&#39;s Fox News which is clearly right leaning or more fair than the Liberal Media. Just going off recent poll numbers of negative coverage of Trump since preseidency. Fox %50 and CNN %95 negative..</p>

<p>What other channels/ networks do conservatives have on Tv?</p>

<p>The Left has PBS, CNN, NBC, MNBC, ESPN, ABC, Hollywood, College Cult Culture etc etc .. it&#39;s not even debatable on the amount of Leftist propaganda being pushed on Tv and your cell phones</p>

<p>The US is FAR from the only country where this is true. In fact, there are a lot of countries where people who are mentally ill have better protections, so less of them have to resort to living on the street. NOT TO MENTION the US is hardly known for their protection of mentally ill homeless people - they are some of the most common victims of violence, a large chunk of people killed by the state via the death penalty, victimised by individuals and the state alike. </p>

<p>Yes, people in the US are, by and large, privileged in many ways. But: a) that has nothing to do with Trump, b) it is far, far less black and white than you&#39;ve painted it here, and c) the bar you&#39;ve set is horrifying low.</p>

<p>This is basic misunderstanding of what &quot;scientific consensus&quot; means as well as what makes a climate scientist. Climate scientists include atmospheric and related scientists who study Climatology, or the study of Earth&#39;s climate conditions. Studies have shown that the vast majority of scientific papers relating to climate studies agree on the basis of human-induced climate change. Here are a few links to that:</p>

</ul>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>We do know. You can enjoy the videos for a short explanation of what the &quot;greenhouse effect&quot; is and how CO2 absorbs sunlight reflected by the Earth and re-emits it back into the atmosphere, trapping these gases. And we can do measurements in controlled settings to figure out how strong this force is.</p>

<ul>

</ul>

<p>CO2 has been higher in colder periods, yes. This leads many people to a trap in which they believe people are telling them that CO2 is the ONLY factor in evaluating the overall climate when it&#39;s not. The Earth in those periods was colder DESPITE the CO2 in the atmosphere. Occurrences such as sun dimness are factors in our planets heating and cooling. In the recent decades, the sun has been stable in output, thus leading to the conclusion it isn&#39;t a factor in our current warming rate. There are also the cases of super-volcanoes erupting and altering the atmosphere. The video series covers similar points and talks about specific cases. I&#39;d highly suggest a watch, at least for curiosities sake so you can have a better understanding of where the science is at.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So? There are also well sourced youtube videos, scientific papers, and websites that question ACC or the severity of ACC. Anyone who acts like ACC is unquestionable is a fucking idiot.</p>

<p>While I do agree there are a lot of youtube videos and websites that spread lies, I&#39;d really be interested if you could post the scientific papers you&#39;re talking about. Not all scientific articles are perfectly correct in a vacuum, some may conclude points incorrectly or use misleading methods to pursue an outcome. If you post specific examples I can take a look at them and maybe we can discuss where you&#39;re getting your sources.</p>

<p>My apologies if you felt personally attacked by my comments towards Republicans. I never checked your post history, but the main political driving forces in congress against climate change reform are Republican elected officials who receive money from Oil company lobbyists.</p>

<p>I reccommend reading the things you post before talking about them: </p>

<p><strong>We find that 66.4% of abstracts expressed no position on AGW, 32.6% endorsed AGW, 0.7% rejected AGW and 0.3% were uncertain about the cause of global warming. Among abstracts expressing a position on AGW, 97.1% endorsed the consensus position that humans are causing global warming.</strong> </p>

<p>Around 70% have no position on ACC, and only about 30% endorse it. The 97.1 number is a percentage of a subset, not a percentage of the entire scientific community.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure what you&#39;re trying to say, honestly. Are you claiming there are literally zero scientists who studied Climatology? That scientific papers that provide methodologies and data are on a large-scale fabricated and the people behind them are actors? This seems like a strange claim to make.</p>

<p>Maybe the problem lies with the distinction between the political term &#39;climatologist&#39; vs a climate scientist. Al Gore is not a climate scientist. He is a political advocate and can be wrong about many things. Climate scientists are not infallible as well. They make mistakes and produce models that need tuning and changing. Where is this assumption that climate scientists say they can&#39;t be wrong? Scientists have only been able to use our mass data collections in recent decades to produce models which are being corrected and tuned all the time and <strong>largely enjoy success</strong> in those models.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The planet and its conditions are under far too many variables and feedback loops for any manmade model to accurately predict with anything approaching real scientific precision.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is just reaching for &#39;complexity.&#39; Yes, climate is complex, that&#39;s why we study it and create models to discover its true nature. That&#39;s what these scientists are doing on a daily basis, discovering the mechanisms of climate. The scientists have studied climate patterns and looked for large scale shifts in climate for guidance, among other occurrences. They have weighed the variables and determined the greenhouse gases, including CO2, have a very strong heating effect on our environment.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We find that 66.4% of abstracts expressed no position on AGW, 32.6% endorsed AGW, 0.7% rejected AGW and 0.3% were uncertain about the cause of global warming. Among abstracts expressing a position on AGW, 97.1% endorsed the consensus position that humans are causing global warming.
Around 70% have no position on ACC, and only about 30% endorse it. The 97.1 number is a percentage of a subset, not a percentage of the entire scientific community.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Exactly, the 97% comes from those exact figures you just stated. The scientific papers that GIVE an opinion on AGW have a 97% acceptance of AGW. 32.6/(32.6+.7+.3) * 100% = 97% There is nothing misleading about it.</p>

<p>The entire point of that study is to look at those numbers. The scientists who studied the CAUSES of climate change are in agreement. They found that 2% of the scientists who study climate change disagree within their studies, less are uncertain, while 97% of those who do study the causes of climate change are in agreement that it is humans that are responsible.</p>

<p>Scientists who do not study Climatology are not experts on climate change. They aren&#39;t anymore qualified to speak on the causes of climate change than the average person. The research is what matters. So it only makes sense to study the people who are studying the origin of climate change.</p>

<p>Except for that funny period from 1997-2007 when there was almost no warming at all, which has not been sufficiently explaind nor was predicted by any of these supposedly accurate climate models. </p>

<p>Yeah, it&#39;s not misleading. All you have to do is ignore the majority of climate papers that do not attribute climate change to humans.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>You seem to be making distinctions that are not specified in the papers. Nowhere are the separate numbers qualified with &quot;climate scientists&quot; versus &quot;non climate scientists&quot;. It&#39;s simply a meta analysis of 11,000 peer reviewed papers about climate change:</p>

<p><strong>We analyze the evolution of the scientific consensus on anthropogenic global warming (AGW) in the peer-reviewed scientific literature, examining 11 944 climate abstracts from 1991–2011 matching the topics &#39;global climate change&#39; or &#39;global warming&#39;.</strong> </p>

<p>In fact i&#39;m not sure how you come up with the notion that people publishing peer reveiwed papers on climate change are not &quot;climate scientists&quot;. I&#39;d like to see the mental gymnasitcs on that one. </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Yeah, a typical example of the inherent bias of the &#39;scientific community&#39;. They wouldn&#39;t pass it and officially publish it anyway, because they have their agenda (so called consensus) to promote.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Here is a website which discusses the massive amounts of issues regarding that paper, among them include Cherrypicking data, outright lies, and non sequitur conclusions.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s not a peer reviewed critique either. But Monckton himself and another climate scientist did issue rebuttals anyway:</p>

<p><a href="http://scienceandpublicpolicy.org/images/stories/papers/monckton/monckton_rebutted.pdf">http://scienceandpublicpolicy.org/images/stories/papers/monckton/monckton_rebutted.pdf</a></p>

<p>Summed up pretty succinctly in the following statement:</p>

<p><strong>I retired four years ago, and at the time of my retirement I was well convinced, as were most technically trained people, that the IPCC&#39;s case for Anthropogenic Global Warming (AGW) is very tight. However, upon taking the time to get into the details of the science, I was appalled at how flimsy the case really is. I was also appalled at the behavior of many of those who helped produce the IPCC reports and by many of those who promote it. In particular I am referring to the arrogance; the activities aimed at shutting down debate; the outright fabrications; the mindless defense of bogus science, and the politicization of the IPCC process and the science process itself.</strong></p>

<p>Complaining about wiretapping, when Obama and the IC showed that they &quot;wiretap&quot; <em>everybody</em> seems normal.

<p>But <a href="http://thediplomat.com/2013/08/us-intelligence-community-the-worlds-4th-largest-military/">here&#39;s</a> some info about our intelligence budget.

<p>Our intelligence budget dwarfs everything else on the planet.

    <div class="md"><p>This is so on point it&#39;s not even funny. I literally loathe Trump. If he is &quot;draining the swamp&quot; then 1) he&#39;s not doing a very good job and 2) whatever govt he wants to replace beyond our current one isn&#39;t going to be pretty. But he&#39;s also being demonised for literally everything he says and does. Nothing like we&#39;ve seen with any president in the past if they were doing exactly what he&#39;s doing. My theory is Trump is trying to replace the current establishment with his own rich + influential friends and the current people in power don&#39;t like that or he may actually go after the pedos that exist in the shadow govt and they&#39;re scared he might try to ruin them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, I&#39;d prefer to not have a retarded president that can&#39;t spell, fact check, or complete a coherent thought. I find it absolutely hilarious (and a little sad) that you think Trump is giving it to you straight. I know there&#39;s a lot of stupid people in America, but for half the country to get fooled by the literal definition of a conman is very very unsettling.

    <div class="md"><p>Obama was a crooked shill of the establishment. He talked big on the campaign trail and unceremoniously bent over for power the day he assumed office. He made token gestures for 8 years, got passed the most undesirable healthcare law that could still produce positive outcomes to make his supporters think he actually accomplished something major, and didn&#39;t rock the boat - which meant more military industrial complex, more global economic imperialism, more human rights erosion, now with a heaping serving of drone strikes killing tens of thousands of civilians.</p>

<p>The problem is that we have only had crooked shills of the establishment for the past ~50 years. Maybe not Carter? JFK was the last one to rock the boat of neoliberalism by simply giving lip service to it and got murdered for it.</p>

<p>The people of the US are suffering stockholm syndrome, and when a less bad abuser comes along like Obama after 8 years of extraordinary battery by Bush and Cheney they welcome it with open arms while not questioning the rampant police brutality, civil asset forfeiture, exploitation of prisoners as slave labor, indefinite detainment in military prisons, and trillion dollar check to the donor class, all while doing bulk data collection and spying on eveyone, all while eroding liberties annually in every NDAA bill, all while continuing provably bad policies like NCLB, the unconstitutional Patriot Act, and keeping the damn Department of Homeland Security around.</p>

<p>It is why the democrats lost. Hillary couldn&#39;t lie as well as Obama because people have known her too long and she didn&#39;t even try. She demonstrably and repeatedly attempted to and succeeded in rigging multiple primaries against Bernie, showing what a sham US &quot;democracy&quot; is under the two party cartel system. It turns out if you can&#39;t put on a good show and trick people well enough that &quot;not as bad as the other guy but still pretty bad&quot; isn&#39;t getting anyone excited.</p>

<p>We will now see how the national oligarchy class itself will manage the crisis. I don&#39;t really see the huge tragedy here the so called &quot;left&quot; establishment is panicking about. They should have panicked a long time before. Now they are all chased by the circumstances.</p>

<p>Several of the arguments I read being made in his favour focus on him being a really good business man. Accuracy of those arguments aside, that is not the quality needed in his current position.<br/>

A CEO will find the lowest possible amount to pay an employee, and now if a CEO is running the US that means he&#39;ll keep minimum wage low and protect business owners. I don&#39;t think it necessarily works like that but I&#39;ve dealt with a lot of Trump supporters (living in a suburb in the bible belt) and the common denominator is always money. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not going to claim that he is perfectly consistent by any means, but yeah <em>many</em> of the inconsistencies people perceive are reported by the MSM as such and they are quite often wrong, exaggerating or using weasel words to intentionally misrepresent. This is classic MSM tactics, the only thing new here is essentially that unification of the establishment against Trump. Also the completely overt and heavy handedness of it. It really seems like more people than ever are being popped out of their bubbles as it becomes too obvious to ignore.</p>

<p>Again, I didn&#39;t vote for him I don&#39;t even particularly like the guy but it is abundantly clear to me that the MSM is actually representing an unelected power structure which is far more sinister and corrupt then Trump can even come close to.</p>

<p>And no I don&#39;t think he is a deep state actor, he is a populist (for better or worse) real-estate mogul who is just trying to do what he thinks is best for America. I don&#39;t agree with his flavor of capitalism and conservativism but I completely agree with him that there exists a foul swamp in DC and it needs draining in a bad way. So long as he&#39;s focused on that I will be behind him. The monsters in that swamp are far worse than Trump.</p>

<p>Yup, it&#39;s bullshit, and this solidifies my belief that there is not an intentional effort to shit on trump, they&#39;re just doing what&#39;s best for the ratings, it just so happens that shitting on trump brings in the money and trump makes it so god damn easy for them to criticize him.</p>

<p>That is an intentional effort. Regardless, Trump does seem to be an obstacle to their geopolitical plans. Trump wants peace with Russia in Syria and doesn&#39;t want to overthrow Assad, while the media and the deep state want the opposite. That&#39;s one reason why he&#39;s catching so much shit</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Seriously? Members of his transition team met with people from many countries, including Russia, as transition teams always do. Normal. Jeff Sessions met with a Russian ambassador along with many other ambassadors as part of his regular duties as a senator. Normal. It wasn&#39;t undisclosed, and was in his senate records, but the media tried to make it into a big deal because he was asked if he met any Russians while acting as a surrogate for Trump, and he said no, because he wasn&#39;t acting as a Trump surrogate when he met the ambassador.</p>

<p>It&#39;s all totally innocuous, and the alternative is to believe that Trump and his associates are secretly trying to commit treason by working with the Russians, of which there is zero proof, motive or even signs that Trump has benefited Russia in any way. It&#39;s McCarthyism, pure and simple. In the 50s, people lost their minds thinking everyone was a secret Russian spy, and in retrospect it was a dark period in U.S. history. You can continue to think that Trump is a traitor, but I&#39;m sure if you had to put money on it you wouldn&#39;t be so confident, and if you are, how can I take that bet against you? I&#39;d love to make money off of someone&#39;s irrational fears.</p>

Why was Mike Flynn denying conversations and lying in his FBI interview? Why did Jared Kushner lie on his clearance form? If these meetings are all above board then why are we hearing about them in media reports after they have been omitted from clearance forms and denied continuously until they are co fronted with irrefutable evidence that they occurred?

    <div class="md"><p>As I said, in the hearing he was asked if he met with Russians as a surrogate for Trump, which he did not. Flynn didn&#39;t lie in his FBI interview, and as it came out later he never even lied to Pence. That whole scandal was nonsense. Kushner resubmitted his form almost immediately with corrections, as is normal. That happens all the time with nominees, and doesn&#39;t mean he is a secret Russian spy. The MSM has tried to make all this into a big deal because they&#39;re trying to create the impression that Trump is compromised by Russia, in spite of no evidence. You&#39;re either too stupid to realize you&#39;re falling for McCarthyite hysteria over nothing, or too angry to care.

    <div class="md"><p>Yes calling me stupid is clearly the most convincing way to win anyone over to your way of thinking. Why are the WH kite flying the idea of firing Mueller then? Wouldn&#39;t it be in Trump&#39;s best interest to make the investigation as open as possible to allow these investigations to find him innocent? Why did he fire Comey, Yates, Bharara when they were asking questions or investigating him? </p>

<p>You are here peddling misinformation. Sessions was asked did he have any contact with Russians and he flat out said no. Then he had that one but he was doing it as a senator. No biggie. Then he resubmitted but he omitted a second meeting with Kislyak. Then he corrected a second time. Now it is apparent that he had a third meeting with Kislyak. Kushner tried to set up a back channel with Russia using their equipment? The man should be fired. Session was supposed to recuse himself but didn&#39;t. </p>

<p>There are reams of proof that at the very least an extensive investigation is needed. If they were innocent, they would welcome investigations. </p>

<p>Here is his actual answer:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;I never met with any Russian officials to discuss issues of the campaign,&quot; Sessions said. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Unless you can show that his public meeting with a Russian ambassador at a Senate function was to discuss issues of the Trump campaign, he didn&#39;t lie, no matter how much you want him to have. Do you seriously think Jeff Sessions is a Russian spy? I mean, think about what you&#39;re saying for a second. A guy who&#39;s been a politician from Alabama for 40 years suddenly defects to the Russians? What crazy spy novel are you living in?</p>

<p>Relying on speculative stories that Trump will fire Mueller is pretty lame. I can&#39;t refute something that is made up. As for the others, they were all Obama appointees who Trump fired just as Obama fired most Bush&#39;s appointees. That&#39;s not a scandal. That&#39;s normal politics. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Look, maybe, I am completely wrong and this is all one big misunderstanding and that Trump and all his surrogates have been caught up in coincidence after coincidence. </p>

<p>Maybe Russia interfered purposefully to put Trump in the WH but they have no connection other than that. Trump, as commander-in-chief, should want to know what happened and how to best defend the nation from future attacks. The fact that he never asked Comey about that is suspicious.

But its become one of those everyday words where nobody really knows who or what it is, or what it means in general. My conceptualization of &quot;deep state&quot; is a complex web of politicians and policy makers, working for similar personal interests without actually colluding together very much (and if/when they do its would probably be secretive and vague) Which it is why it&#39;s difficult to really know how its functioning...I don&#39;t think &quot;deep state&quot; is an organization or secret society, but instead, an array corrupt people contributing to corruption for personal gain at different times. </p>

<p>The damage due to indirect effects is quite significant.  Hell, just the term, &quot;Deep State&quot; is now an everyday dinner table term.  People are aware that there are multiple facades of government vying for power, and we do not have the representative democracy we were taught.</p>

<p>Sorta like how Obama&#39;s rhetoric was so anti-gun that he single-handedly rebooted the entire gun industry for past decade.  Despite doing absolutely nothing at all to actually implement restrictions on guns or gun ownership, and despite an overall relaxing of gun rules on both Federal and State levels under his administration.  Nevertheless, on the power of rhetoric alone, over 100 million firearms were sold (in a country of 320 million people).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>All i see Trump doing so far is making a huge weapons deal with Saudi Arabia who he said were terrorist funders during the campaign (they are).  He also stacked his campaign with Goldman employees after attacking Ted Cruz for being connected to them.  He atacked Syria, after saying numerous times we should stay away from Syria and then he ramped up Nato event though its a waste of money for American taxpayers..  All I see is him carrying out the establishments plans and goals.  If anything he is empowering the so called deep state...</p>

<p>If anything he is a massive hypocrite and liar as well as open to being bribed by anybody that can enrich him like Saudi Arabia, no matter the damage and cost to Americans. He is out for himself, his business, his legacy and the best way to do that is to give in to the establishment.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I haven&#39;t gone looking through your post history to see how you go about defending Trump, so here&#39;s a fairly generic response:</p>

<p>Unnamed sources are pretty common in investigative journalism, especially when leaking this information can cause some type of harm to come to the source.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t get me wrong, I applaud and support any critical thinking, because we should take all the news with a grain of salt. I think it&#39;s important to look at the news and try to verify things for yourself. </p>

<p>But at the same time, it&#39;s important to <em>encourage</em> investigations into wrongdoing, especially at the level of US President. Too many people have knee-jerk reactions on both sides, and in the pro-Trump camp it&#39;s too common to see people saying to shut this down because there&#39;s nothing here.</p>

<p>But there IS something worth investigating here. Personally, I don&#39;t think Trump himself has knowingly done anything illegal with regards to Russia. But there is so much from his administration pointing to gross negligence/incompetence at best, and downright collusion at worst. As a country, we are obligated to see that this is investigated thoroughly. And arguing against people who are calling for MORE INFORMATION would definitely not be the right way to get it. Let&#39;s get the information first, then worry about the conclusions everyone has already drawn.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re doing that same shit again, twisting the truth. Trump warned Putin of a potential terror attack and nothing was illegal about that. Obama said &quot;I&#39;ll be much more flexible once I&#39;m in office, relay that to Vladimir&quot; to Putin&#39;s messenger in 2012 before starting his second run. Hillary sold weapons to Russia. Trump&#39;s administration has had the least verified contact with Russia in decades. All the other claims have been &quot;anonymous sources who know Comey&#39;s friends that are familiar with Comey&#39;s line of thinking speculated that maybe Trump is a poopoo-head&quot;.</p>

So far he has been doing exactly what he campaigned on. Getting tougher on the border and illegal criminals, removing us from bad trade deals, removing regulations that harm the economy and average workers, picked a Justice in the vein of Justice Scalia. All these things he said he would do and he is either already has or is trying to implement. A witch hunt led by losers who can&#39;t accept America isn&#39;t the leftist &quot;utopia&quot; they all thought it was is not his admins. doing. </p>

<p>There was a more recent episode of the Simpsons where Marge was friends with Smithers, and she said something to him like &quot;do you think the reason were so loyal to these men others see as awful is because we just can&#39;t admit we were wrong?&quot; </p>

<p>He is a disrespectful little cunt, shoving another prime minister like that. Absolutely pathetic. Trump is not only incredibly narcissistic, he also seem to be a bit sociopathic and schizophrenic, cause he cannot remember things he have said earlier - and changes his view on different topics. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mean, when Republican reps have to say, Well, what he did is ok &quot;He&#39;s just new at this&quot; exemplifies his incompetence. This is the president of the US. If Trump was really serious about being president, he should have realized that he needed to do some incredibly extensive research before hand. He didn&#39;t. He is incompetent. If I advertise myself as a electrician but have no background in the subject...im going to be incompetent at that job until I educate myself. that doesn&#39;t mean that I should keep trying to be an electrician and keep taking in clients, so that eventually I will have the appropriate knowledge....no, because I probably cause electrical fires in 30 homes before I even realized what I had done wrong.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t care for Trump or his domestic policies, only his foreign policies and so far I don&#39;t like what I see. </p>

<p>However I do support his presidency, the rule of law, democracy and fair elections. First I watched the DNC cheat Sanders and now we are watching an incredible and sustained effort to either impeach Trump or at least obstruct to the point of making it nearly impossible to govern. The US is walking down a dangerous path by supporting these efforts and/or allowing it to happen. If the Deep State is allowed to go forward with this &#39;soft coup&#39;, imagine how the US society as a whole will feel when they realize they have zero power left.</p>

<p>If Trump is unable to do anything with his policies, he will at least go down in history for exposing the partisan corruption/collusion with the MSM, the power the Deep State really has and the almost complete destruction of democracy and the rule of law.</p>

<p>The funniest thing is that Trump wouldn&#39;t have deliberately done it, only his presence has forced it all into the open and people are beginning to wake up and see it on a massive scale.</p>

<p>Already, this accidental president&#39;s greatest legacy will be lifting the veil and accidentally exposing just how corrupt the US government really is. </p>

<p>For those of you who hate Trump and are hell bent on getting him impeached or at least destroying his chance to govern, will be your greatest mistake. You are in effect, already turning him into a martyr. </p>

<p>that&#39;s not what that means. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Look at all the insults of your intelligence if you support Trump</p>

<p>yeah, that&#39;s because there&#39;s nowhere to hide. it&#39;s not possible to rationally argue that trump is a president that mostly has his shit together and is doing good things for the country. </p>

<p>as unfortunate as the reality is, trump supporters can&#39;t accept blatant realities and tend to double down into ever-more-deluded justifications of trump&#39;s actions. they&#39;re not smart. smart people jumped that ship long ago. what&#39;s left are the hangers on who are too emotionally invested to admit they were duped by empty rhetoric and hope or galled by overt racism. </p>

<p>i don&#39;t even blame them any more. i just laugh. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s been the message all along-- That the american public has been controlled and subdued for so long and much of it by the same families over and over. It&#39;s as if to say &quot;We hate you so much that we would vote for an embicile like DT before we sign up for one.more round of you corrupt, lying, self serving, overlords.&quot; </p>

<p>All this talk about DT bc he is transparent about his disdain and moronic plans. Other politicians are just as evil but they feed us a big heaping pile of FU while smiling and being charming while doing it. It&#39;s as if Americans only care that their politicians are polite and warm. It doesn&#39;t matter what they actually do as long as they pretend to your face, control the media narrative and maintain the status quo. 
I support DT simply bc he is momentarily upset their apple cart. I laugh at how indignant all of them are when they have knowingly been signing off on outsourcing, insourcing, arms deals, Oil subsidies,  signing free trade deals, NOT arresting bankster criminals. Sggning their buddies up for military contracts, handing away our freedoms via the patriot act and the NDAA. Toppling dictators/democratically elected govts like Libya, Ukraine, now syria.  Using our military to guard opium fields in Afghanistan in obvious collusion to support the opiate scourge. The list goes on and on and on. Nearly all of our congress and senate vote in lockstep on these kinds of issues and we are worried bc of mean tweets? This problem runs way deeper than a jacka** like DT. He&#39;s just a blip on the radar and I&#39;m sure he&#39;ll be go down like a blip. They have it on lock. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Confirmation bias is the natural inclination to accept as truth evidence that agrees with what you already believe in, and reject evidence that doesn&#39;t. For example, if a guy says &quot;I regularly grab women in the pussy&quot; and &quot;I go into female dressing rooms&quot; and you think he&#39;s like a nice guy because you don&#39;t like Hillary, you have severe confirmation bias. Or if he writes about 5 tweets a day without showing anything that resembles knowledge or vision or understanding how things work or intelligence, and you still think he&#39;s not a moron because you don&#39;t want him to be one, then you have confirmation bias.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>idk how you can&#39;t see that coming when he is blasting MSM as &quot;fake news&quot; every time it doesn&#39;t agree with his narrative.  </p>

<p>he took on the integrity of all journalists in doing so.  when all news is being blasted as fake well then what is real?  what do we use to gauge real news?  </p>

<p>is it just stuff that confirms our biases or is it stuff that cites their sources and uses reliable sources?  </p>

<p>idk too much but I went to a public high school in Kentucky and learned how to properly cite sources and to look for proper sources so that my arguments held water.  or is that something we don&#39;t concern ourselves with anymore and if it doesn&#39;t fit our narrative we want to push we just call it fake as soon as it does?  fake news has no credible sources, period.  if you scroll to the bottom of a article and all they cite as their sources is other journalists talking then its FAKE NEWS.  it&#39;s a editorial at best.    real news can be wrong, that happens but it doesn&#39;t mean the whole institution is fake, but real news cites experts, real news sites credible sources.  </p>

<p>fake news is bold big time headlines that claim something extreme and then the article is fluff to back up that one thesis in the title but the sources to back up that thesis are two pundits talking to each other on a television screen... that is fake news people.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fantastic points here. Bottom line: Donald Trump is and always was a fraud outsider.</p>

<p>He is actually the next move to gain power so that Republicans -- heavily discredited by GWB and the internet - could play propaganda against their own team to put one of their own in there.</p>

<p>They got a little more than they bargained for with Donald Trump -- not on the policy side but rather on the ego side. Let&#39;s face it. Republicans love Donald Trump. They support all of his policies (you know, the ones that weren&#39;t flip flopped after the election). </p>

<p>Republicans and MSM set this whole election up for Donald Trump. </p>

<p>Republicans placed him in with a huge crowd of the usual suspects -- assuring that he would win the primaries -- all the while grumbling.</p>

<p>Then, some of the most vile Republicans backed HRC -- giving her the kiss of establishment death.</p>

<p>Finally, MSM gave Donald Trump unprecedented coverage.</p>

<p>Number one, they fought him pretty hard in the primaries, but couldn&#39;t super-delegate him to death like they did with Bernie.  Number two, his campaign and presidency really did not do the Republicans any favors ... at least in terms of winning over future undecided voters.  Case in point of number two: Trump brought Alex Jones and all the Sandy-Hook business into the Republican party ... I do not believe they wanted that or calculated that it will help in future elections.</p>

<p>I agree that he has a target on his back. </p>

<p>Unfortunately HE is the one that put it there. </p>

<p>I have never seen someone with less decorum... such a glowing example of a statesman and a world leader (*insert sarcasm) ... the man tweets like a Millennial who has doubled up on his Adderall and, on a daily basis, sometimes hourly, he puts his foot in his mouth and makes the United States look more and more like a sinking ship of a country. </p>

<p>PLEASE impeach the man and get someone in there that at LEAST SEEMS like they care about the country more than if they &quot;one-up&quot; someone like a little boy losing a passing match with the wind. </p>

<p>He is incompetent and an idiot. </p>

<p>Protect our state secrets and IMPEACH HIM NOW .</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Trump is destroying himself, the man is a complete fucking idiot. </p>

<p>When someone speaks the way that he does, with limited vocabulary and poor grammar, it means that he <em>thinks</em> just as simply. </p>

<p>Trump has poor comprehension of cause-and-effect, especially when it comes to government. He barely seems to understand how the U.S. political system even works; his comments about how the Constitution were &quot;outdated&quot; and &quot;just getting in the way&quot; tells you what this man thinks, how much he knows, and what he expected of the office. Obviously this is a recipe for failure. </p>

<p>He has appointed probably the worst cabinet of any presidency in history. Literally every appointee is out to erode civil rights or the environment. That is not a mark of a man that stands for progress. </p>

<p>Good leaders command respect, loyalty, and discreetness. Trump is none of those to anyone, not even himself. It&#39;s no wonder so many leaks have occurred under him. The only people willing to ally with him are out for greedy agendas and are so overtly corrupt it&#39;s almost laughable if it weren&#39;t so serious; see: Ajit Pai. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Complaining about his choice of mustard and making fun of a few malapropisms respectively.</p>

<p>Trump gets hate because trump <em>invites</em> hate.  He calls his opponents &quot;enemies&quot; and uses the same language to describe critics<br/>
that he uses to describe terrorists.  He regularly attacks the media and journalists, even when they&#39;re reporting the truth.</p>

<p>A lot of people don&#39;t trust the MSM, but Trump&#39;s method of outmaneuvering the media started by deliberately making an enemy of them.  That&#39;s what he does, and that&#39;s why he&#39;s seeing this vitriol.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re all over this thread saying how confusing it is for you, but it&#39;s pretty straightforward why all this is happening.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>American media gravitates towards tabloid/sensationalist style news, and has a heavy bias towards whatever is most interesting.</p></li>
<li><p>Obama/Bush/Clinton&#39;s media strategy was ignoring ridiculous shit and giving seriously-worded responses when they could spin things.  Trump&#39;s strategy is directly calling journalists liars, sometimes by name, and discrediting them in the eyes of his supporters. </p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>No, it just says next to nothing.</p>

<p>Letters to the editor are not automatically &quot;marching orders&quot;.  And while a lot of journalists report from a liberal perspective, MSNBC in particular has a marked <em>bias</em> in addition to that.</p>

<p>Even if you accept the entire MSM as colluding with the DNC, the <em>actual complaints</em>, when compared to the right-wing media&#39;s complaints about Obama, and his response to that, Trump&#39;s still got a lot to answer for.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not fond of his decisions to escalate the middle eastern conflict (including his snap decision to attack Syria based on dubious intelligence). </p>

<p>Pulling out of the Paris accord was a major blow to international PR with negligible benefits.    Overall his environmental record is abysmally substandard compared to Obama, Bush, Clinton, Reagan, and Carter.  He&#39;s emphasizing coal mining, an obsolete billion dollar industry at the expense of both green energy industries <em>and</em> more efficient fossil fuel industries like natural gas.  </p>

<p>He fired the director of the FBI for dubious reasons, and didn&#39;t even have a replacement nominated for a full month, which means the FBI has even <em>less</em> oversight and direction than it normally does.</p>

<p>He openly opposes the first amendment.  He praises regimes that disallow free speech, and openly refuses to go places where he might be protested.   He regularly attacks his critics using the same language that he uses with regards to terrorists, and encourages violence against protesters and critics.</p>

<p>And overall, he just doesn&#39;t hold himself to the standard of dignity that I would expect of a President of the United States.   You&#39;re talking about a guy  who&#39;s tweeting at the TV every day and throws public tantrums about celebrities at 3:00am in the morning.  </p>

<p>It&#39;s pretty clear overall he has no idea what he&#39;s doing.  Even with federal appointments: Obama&#39;s appointees were often blocked by a hostile congress, but Trump&#39;s executive branch is empty too because he hasn&#39;t even bothered to suggest anybody for those positions.  Meanwhile he&#39;s taking a full blown million dollar vacation to a golf resort every single weekend.  </p>

<p>There were a handful of things I appreciated about his platform (like the anti-lobbying, which he shirked away from with waivers; and reforming the VA, which he hasn&#39;t even started on).  But he&#39;s not getting anything accomplished at all except blustering.   He&#39;s more likely to go on twitter and say &quot;somebody should do something&quot;.  He&#39;s the president and his party has control of all three branches of government and he&#39;s <em>still</em> blustering and useless, and blaming everybody else for his failure.  It&#39;s an embarassment to the nation.</p>

<p>The worst thing isn&#39;t any particular action, it&#39;s the general hypocrisy.  He said he would &quot;drain the swamp&quot; and then stuffed his cabinet with millionaire banking executives and CEO&#39;s.  He created these restrictive anti-lobbying rules, one of the few points I agreed with him on, and then signed a waiver to anybody who even <em>hinted</em> they were planning on selling out.  He&#39;s such a hypocrite that posting his tweets in response to his actions has become an international meme.   People just don&#39;t respect the US like they did before.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Seems pretty equal on both sides in terms of lack of coherent arguments.</p>

<p>Most of the anti trump side seems to claim everything they say is embedded by facts while not really bringing any info at all besides saying he&#39;s a rich idiot. Seriously, ctrl f the words &quot;stupid&quot; &quot;moron&quot; &quot;idiot&quot; and you&#39;ll see that&#39;s what most of these peoples arguments are.</p>

<p>The pro trump side just says that it&#39;s insane how much negative media is being spewed out daily towards the guy.</p>

<p>Not that I&#39;m crazy for Trump or anything, but it really is bizarre how much vigor is going into hating the dude. I&#39;ve never seen it before, not even towards known murderers, rapists or terrorists. People foam at the mouth every time he says anything, stupid or not. To deny it is kind of unreasonable and to claim some blanket statement like &quot;he&#39;s an idiot&quot; does nothing but prove the OPs point.</p>

<p>I understand &quot;both sides&quot; have done it, in terms of conservative media towards Obama and liberal towards Trump. But never before has so many different media outlets run hit after hit. Not to mention the turfing (and creation) of whole subreddits basically dedicated to hating the guy.</p>

<p>I get that he&#39;s unpopular, but the amount of self destructive violent hatred towards him and his supporters is pretty worrying. Divide and conquer, and all that. Never seen it so black and white before.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>lol, my bad </p>

<p>My argument still stands. Being born rich doesn&#39;t make you smart, Trumps own words should prove that fact alone. But ya know, &#39;climate change is a Chinese hoax&#39; and &#39;Obama is a Kenyan Muslim socialist who founded Isis&#39;, these are rational beliefs to hold as long as you&#39;re rich. </p>

But you know Trump is indefensible outside of his bank account, bc if he was, you would&#39;ve provided some actual reasons for why you believe what you believe. </p>

<p>Btw, IQ tests are not a reliable test for intelligence, as no such test exists. There is no concrete, easily-definable range of what &#39;intelligence&#39; is, so we go off what people say and do. Crazy, right?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You couldn&#39;t be more wrong, no really you couldn&#39;t. You really have to try and suspend all cognitive thought in order to be so wrong. There are IQ tests, and that can not be refuted. When some criminal commits a crime that might send him to the electric chair what does his lawyer do? He has an IQ test administered to show that his defendant falls in to the retarded zone. This would allow any judge to dismiss the death sentence as a possible sentence. IQ tests have been supported by science, but fell out of PC favor back in the sixties when they proved on average, that certain races were consistently on the bottom rung of intelligence. Please don&#39;t be a science denier.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dude, IQ tests are heavily refuted by people who spend their entire lives studying this stuff that are smarter than both of us. They fell out of &quot;PC&quot; favor because IQ tests don&#39;t account for many different variables and generally work off the assumption that intelligence can be reduced to a quantifiable number, is static throughout your life, and isn&#39;t influenced by environment, culture, wealth, etc. </p>

<p>This is super easy.</p>

<li>Comey botched the Hillary email server job.  Dems and Repubs called for him to be fired.</li>
<li>Comey admitted he was pressured by Lynch to not call call hillarys thing an INVESTIGATION but to call it a &quot;matter&quot;</li>
<li>Comey was anti-trump (as proved by his memos and leaks)</li>
<li>Comey himself admits &quot;I serve at the pleasure of the president.  he can fire me for any reason, or no reason at all&quot;</li>
<li>Comey is a self admitted leaker (we know of 1 case, maybe there was more)</li>
</ul>

<p>During his interview comey said &quot;I read in the media about this russia stuff and i was confused and concerned <em>because we were not seeing anything like that on our end</em>.  So I asked around the FBI to see if someone else knew something.  We had no evidence.  So I went to members of congress and said &#39;hey, I dont know where this stuff is coming from but its not true&#39;&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>All weak points. I guess since you used bullets I&#39;ll refute them individually.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Comey botched the Hillary email server job. Dems and Repubs called for him to be fired. Hillary was undeniably guilty of several very serious crimes.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Three issues with this. Firstly, republicans, especially Trump, praised Comey when he reopened the investigation a week before the election. The idea that he was fired because he hurt Hillary in the election is laughable. Secondly, the timing makes no sense. If this was really the reason Comey was fired then it would have happened earlier in Trump&#39;s presidency and not right around the time that Flynn, Manafort and others were being subpoenaed by the FBI. And thirdly, and most importantly, Trump <a href="https://www.vox.com/2017/5/11/15628276/trump-comey-fired-russia">literally said it was because of Russia</a>. Regardless of whether or not Trump is guilty, firing someone because you are being investigated makes you look guilty. Not to mention how inappropriate it is.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Comey admitted he was pressured by Lynch to not call call hillarys thing an INVESTIGATION but to call it a &quot;matter&quot; (political move to help hillarys prez run)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You&#39;re completely changing your reasoning for why Comey was fired now. The fact that you can&#39;t stick to a specific reason makes it clear you&#39;re just throwing shit at the wall to see what sticks. This reason in particular makes no sense because nobody knew about this until the Comey hearing. He also continued to refer to it as an investigation regardless so it makes even less sense as a reason.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Comey was anti-trump (as proved by his memos and leaks)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He was made uneasy by the fact the Trump continually called him and arranged meetings with him. In the eight years of Obama there were only two times Comey and Obama spoke: at the beginning of his presidency and at the end. Regardless, this is no reason to fire an FBI director. The decision to leak information that could be destroyed by Trump after the Comey firing should be praised by this subreddit. If you support Assange and oppose Comey on this then you are a hypocrite.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Comey himself admits &quot;I serve at the pleasure of the president. he can fire me for any reason, or no reason at all&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Whether something is legally acceptable and whether it is morally acceptable are two different things. Time will tell whether the firing legally fits the definition of obstruction of justice but I am arguing that it is wrong from a moral standpoint right now.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Comey is a self admitted leaker (we know of 1 case, maybe there was more)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, after he was fired. So it makes no sense that this is why he was fired.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay first of all what you just said is so incredibly false. There are absolutely reasons for firing someone that are illegal in the United States. Have you ever held a job before?</p>

<p>Second of all, whether the Comey firing was morally acceptable and legally acceptable are two completely different things. Whether or not the COmey firing qualifies as obstruction of justice is an issue that I am not qualified to discuss, and if you didn&#39;t know that you can&#39;t fire someone for any reason, then I am certain you are in the same boat as me in terms of knowledge of the law. I am argunig that what Trump did is unacceptable from a moral standpoint, not a legal one.</p>

<li><p><a href="https://youtu.be/MJ15ymETv-s">https://youtu.be/MJ15ymETv-s</a> this explains it.</p></li>
<li><p>Seeing as how twitter played a big role in him winning the election why would he drop that now. It&#39;s an extremely powerful tool. He gets to bypass the media and have the media talk about whatever he wants with a tweet. Maybe some are stupid I guarantee you don&#39;t realize how those &quot;stupid&quot; tweets are changing your framing and the global narrative though.</p></li>
<li><p>His tweets should have 0 effect on law. Any legitimate scholar would tell you that. Otherwise the Judicial branch can usurp the executive and legislative branch by just claiming they can mind read what they meant with every law. The only thing the judges should be assessing is the law.</p></li>
<li><p>You&#39;re just saying this because you heard it as an argument before. Obviously that staff isn&#39;t needed if everything is going fine without them. It&#39;s only been 6 months anyway and Trump is busy fighting off 24/7 anti-trump media.</p></li>
<li><p>It&#39;s not leaking when he is the one who decides what is and isn&#39;t classified.</p></li>
<li><p>Sounds like fake news. Haven&#39;t heard about it yet.</p></li>
<li><p>You don&#39;t like what he says 😭. It&#39;s not idiotic. It&#39;s changing the frame, it might make him look a lil ignorant but subconsciously you will give him a lot more credit for doing it right. Or he just actually realized it was harder than he thought... who cares.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Please don&#39;t move the goal posts again. I&#39;m not arguing that Trump doesn&#39;t put his foot in his mouth occasionally. Maybe edit your original comment to that?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I honestly don&#39;t know enough about world history to include most historical leaders, but I was speaking mostly from the perspective of modern politics, diplomacy and int&#39;l relations. Japanese Internment was one of the darkest moments in our country&#39;s history and I don&#39;t want to minimize that at all but I find it hard to believe that FDR was as purposefully inflammatory, ignorant, and combative as a world leader as Trump is. We have a president that lies without second thought, refuses to consult scientific experts on global issues, weakens the &#39;sovereignty&#39; of america on the world stage, and cyberbullies private citizens and foreign politicians alike. Its just recklessness on a base level, imo. </p>

<p>Also, I would probably argue that with our knowledge of the mistakes made in the past like Japanese internment, it&#39;s even more reckless to try to bring that type of rhetoric back into our 21st century politics (ie, Muslim ban)</p>

<p>Has he upset the status quo? Sure, but not in a good way. He&#39;s reinstituting the formerly fledgling war on drugs and he&#39;s just as much of a war hawk as an establishment president would be. He&#39;s incredibly pro business and continues to de regulate the financial industry. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeeesss...? Anyone making any prediction is doing so based on assumptions.  You are also making an assumption by thinking this may not be the case. There&#39;s nothing wrong with that (unless you&#39;re going to act/effect others based on these assumptions). </p>

<p>To clarify, I mean that the last 3 presidencies have had a lot more time to rack up the destruction you&#39;re talking about. 8 years vs 6 months. You really gotta wait until Trumps presidency is over to compare them on overall destructiveness. </p>

<p>ps, nobody above me in this thread said the &quot;worst ever,&quot; just most reckless and destructive. So idk what you&#39;re quoting but it&#39;s not the person you responded to. </p>

<p>On Memorial Day, I asked people why patriotism was so important. They treated my question as an insult, as if I didn&#39;t understand that patriotism is essentially the bedrock of our country. </p>

<p>But why do so many statists act like America owns the rights to patriotism?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Globalism in of itself isn&#39;t bad.  People are.  People are corrupt and design corrupt systems.  Globalism is one system with no competition.  It will swiftly degenerate into a system where a minuscule few gets 90% of the worlds resources.  Its what people do.  There is no limit on greed, people want infinite power and infinite resources, no matter what.</p>

<p>America is too big as well, we waste so much, and murder,, rob, and extort so much from the rest of the world.  The average population of the world is 6.6 million.  Maybe there should be a maximum national of that.  When a nation exceeds that it has to break up within 20 years.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wish it was better organized and more determined. We have a moron with a poor vocabulary pushing horrible policies . Healthcare, budget , education , environmental policies all terrible . All of his appointments are shit and remind me of the legion of doom . Pence for VP? Betsy Devos education ? Jeff sessions attorney general? Steve Bannon chief of staff. Horrible excuses for human beings.</p>

<p>The constant amateurish lying even when the opposing truth was said by him on camera ? Then trying to pretend he&#39;s not credible then Comey? Pushing away and pissing off all of our Europe allies and even making Israel made by braffing about secrets . The icing on the cake and worst part isn&#39;t even wether or not he actually colluded with Russia which I doubt he has the brains for since he doesn&#39;t even consult his staff about anything including his moronic tweets that damage him more than anyone else could . 
No the final transgression is pretending the Russia interference was fake news while every single intelligence agency agrees and has finally admitted that it really happened . Removing all the sanctions missing their ass and then trying to obstructing the investigation not necessarily because he&#39;s involved but just because it&#39;s bad pr? Want a piece of shit who cares 0% about protecting America and 100% about covering how own ass. He&#39;s sloppy not even a smooth criminal I can respect . </p>

<p>Fuck him straight up his old ass . The effort isn&#39;t strong enough . The whole country ends to band together and take this human garbage out of power.  Take this whiny bullhshit back to The Donald where you can all circle jerk each other that your own personal L Ron Hubbard is being picked on .</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not like he&#39;s good, but how anybody could think he&#39;s anything more than the paper representative of something much more sinister and um...smarter.  You couldn&#39;t hope for a worse idiot to divide people and then throw under the bus.  And then it just goes back and forth between D and R for eternity.  Riling people up a little bit is good for politics--enough to cause chaos within local tribal groups but not nation-level tribal groups.  They know that the low level chaos barely affects them but for people who aren&#39;t rich and connected it causes real harm and they need someone to blame.  The kicker of course is that oh those dwindling finances that causes the whole mess, yeah they pocketed that money.  And of double course, the entire structure is designed to vampirize your labor.</p>

<p>They push the myth of financial competition.  What really produces innovation is INTELLECTUAL competition, which people love to partake in even when money isn&#39;t involved.  And it makes sense that intellectual competition produces intellectual progress, by a selection process.  What FINANCIAL COMPETITION does is select for the best ways to...make money.  Of course money can incentivize things.  But in a perfect happy world it would be more like a contest maybe.  Not run by the government, not run by corporations, run by aggregates of futuristic family units living in creative habitats, trading their own unique goods, etc.  But of course there are a lot of obstacles to that.  And one of them is the idea that financial competition is good for everybody, when its benefit is not even claimed to be about progressing and helping humanity but explicitly about making money.  And of course as you all know the governments, banks, and corporations steal your labor and shackle you in debt, without even using the money for much more than graft, guns, jails, and cops. The financial competition concept is a circle jerk.  Except the people in the circle jerk have two cocks--one that&#39;s nice and pretty that they put in the cicle, and one that&#39;s like a mutated dead dragon&#39;s cock and leaking polonium-210-riddled pus, and all those android lich cocks or whatever are jerking off DEBT SLAVERY onto everyone in the middle of the circle.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve never seen such a negative concerted effort or emphasis before on another human-being or group besides actual heinous criminals/groups like the KKK, Westboro Baptist Church, Nazis, etc.</p>

<p>That being said, in my lifespan of only four presidents (Clinton, Bush, Obama, Trump) they all have been publicly humiliated for different reasons, Obama ironically being the least harshly impacted.</p>

<ul>
<li>Clinton has a scandal despite what seems like a phenomenal achievement(left office with a <em>surplus</em>, no budget deficit)</li>
<li>Bush started an unpopular war/lie(s), and grew the deficit more than any president in history</li>
<li>Obama actually did nothing wrong imo, he came into office in the middle of the housing crisis, and it was solved before his first term ended. I agree there was probably some inherent prejudice brought to the surface within our collective unconscious as a result(nothing <em>horrible</em> imo).</li>
<li>Trump has treated people like an absolute dick, that&#39;s it. No proven sexual allegations, but clearly a person whose lack of experience in submissive positions in life has led him to be overbearing in satisfying his wants/desires.  His experience with Comey and everyone else is just that - he&#39;s used to a lifestyle where people always do exactly what he wants. He&#39;s probably done some immoral stuff in office so far, but nothing in the name of doing America wrong unless one legitimately thinks he&#39;s working for the Russians...</li>
</ul>

<p>Is there a &quot;Deep State?&quot; Literally speaking, idk, maybe, I&#39;m not ruling it out. Is there one metaphorically(not imaginary) in the sense that, <em>systematically</em>, the society shifts, and through social norms, legislation, new power-relations established in political+non-political offices, and our collective unconscious begins to reinforce a new status quo from the tip-toes of society all the way to the head? Yeah, thats definitely a Deep(rooted) State without question.</p>

<p>So deeply engrained that any opposing force will hit a wall constantly if they continue to go against it. Trump has a shit ton of walls in his way because he is totally opposite of what so much of the Western World represents now. There is an effort to destroy him, doesn&#39;t matter whether it&#39;s overt or covert.</p>

<p>The &quot;pedophile&quot; charge was most likely referring to a 1998 VH1 documentary where Nugent said that he had a history with young girls.</p>

<p>“I was addicted to girls. It was hopeless. It was beautiful,” Nugent said at the time. “I got the stamp of approval of their parents… I guess they figured better Ted Nugent than some drug-infested punk in high school.”</p>

<p>In the song &quot;Jailbait,&quot; Nugent sang about his affection for young girls: &quot;Well, I don&#39;t care if you&#39;re just 13 / You look too good to be true.&quot;</p>

<p>Are you going to post facts this time, or just some more feelings?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wait, so convicted child girl rapist or not? If I remember correctly having consensual sex with your wife is not &quot;rape&quot;.</p>

<p>Woman&#39;s allegations != confirmed child rapist. I could easily allege that you raped me, does that make you guilty? </p>

<p>Married underage woman != confirmed child rapist</p>

<p>Do you understand yet? I think that&#39;s 3 times I&#39;ve requested proof and you still can&#39;t provide. Just admit it, you are a deranged liar.</p>

<p>HAHA! You couldn&#39;t even provide evidence for your last bullshit claim and you&#39;ve already moved onto the next. I&#39;d love to see the evidence you have of that, but it&#39;s becoming increasingly obvious that you don&#39;t care about facts at all, that your only intent here is to spread bullshit you can&#39;t back up and whine like a little baby. No matter how many times I expose your lies and delusions, you&#39;ll continue to live in your little world. </p>

<p>You&#39;re a lost cause.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You chose to say convicted</p>

<p>You support trump.</p>

<p>Did you mind when he claimed Obama wasn&#39;t born here ? Did you mind when he sent investigators to Hawaii and claimed they found things but never speaks of it now?</p>

<p>Do you mind that he was friends with Epstein and knew he liked underage girls and said he was fond of them? Or that he said on tape how he moves on women like bitches and gets to do it cause of who he is. </p>

<p>Or when he claimed hillary was many things she certainly hasn&#39;t been convicted of</p>

<p>But those are all fine, cause he&#39;s totally anti establishment with that cabinet of establishment folks, and he&#39;s definitely working for you, not himself.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No problem. People with special needs frequently need help with this sort of elaborate thinking. </p>

<p>As a non american, i can say that it is embarassing and tragic to watch the greatest country on earth (or so i used to believe) stoop to a level so low. I&#39;m not even talking about your crazy &quot;wall&quot; to Mexico, or your insane goading of your closest allies. I&#39;m talking about ceding control of the globe to some IDIOT, who makes your once glorious country look like a fucking JOKE, and letting China and Russia run your show. The trump voters always say they want to make America great again, but they are too fucking stupid to realize that they have made everything worse. And if you disagree, then read a fucking book for once in your life. </p>

Or do you feel comfortable with being represented by a mealy mouthed liar, and suspected sex felon? That&#39;s what you feel comfortable with America being represented as at the global level? You go from Ww2 glory to some fat butterball speaking for all of you? Its ridiculous.</p>

<p>Secondly, nobody even knows if he&#39;s lying or not because he is so fucking shady that he wont even PROVE it you fucking idiot. Like, doesn&#39;t this seem at all inappropriate or weird? Im glad that not all Americans are as slow as you, otherwise we would all be speaking russian.</p>

<p>I made my opinion known that I think the MSM reporting on his policies is fair game and gave examples of their criticism. I also said character attacks shouldn&#39;t be fair game. I didn&#39;t present that article because I agree with it, I didn&#39;t post that to show everyone CNBC&#39;s opinion. You asked for a further explanation on the MSM reporting on his tax reform, I provided just one of many examples. If you didn&#39;t ask, I would never have posted that.

<p>At <em>worst</em> he&#39;s got some unprofessionalism for a president.<br/>
But that&#39;s kinda why he got elected.    </p>

<p>You say &#39;he&#39;s not a politician!&#39; as an insult.<br/>
The right says &#39;he&#39;s not a politician!&#39; as a compliment.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s all part of the distraction. They bring in what appears to be a nationalist and sick their liberal terrorist groups after him to create the chaos they need to be able to run away with the loot. Trump is passing some shady agendas and the tax-payers are footing the bill. He is doing just enough good things to get away with the rest. There is still a conservative group of people in the US big enough to pit against the left. And vise versa. This is what they want. The problem with this is that eventually all the effort and money put towards the left will create an imbalance and the nation will implode. But right now, they are reaping the benefits of a scattered, diversified, multicultural workforce.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hillary is going to try to get the Dems to run her again.  She is using her media connections to keep up the onslaught on Trump so that even she will look good compared to him.</p>

<p>The truth is that she would actually be a lot worse than Trump.  Trump is not a good president at all but he is still not as bad as Hillary or George W. Bush who was the worst president of all time hands down.  In fact, I wonder if Bush is in on the media hype against Trump too because he doesn&#39;t want to be known as the wrost president of all time.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Russian hacking IS NOT the same as &quot;colluding with Trump&quot;. You seem to have gotten the two mixed up, probably because you hate Trump so much. You know who else is hacking? Practically all 1st world countries, all the time. Hacking is nothing new. You also still haven&#39;t provided ANY evidence. There is none. Even the DNC refused to let the FBI look at their &quot;hacked&quot; server. There is zero evidence Russia &quot;hacked&quot; the election. Obama said that was impossible anyway.</p>

<p>You think you&#39;re smart because you drop the &quot;cognitive dissonance&quot; catchphrase every chance you get. Truth is, you&#39;re not smart. You&#39;re just a fool.</p>

<p>By the way, it&#39;s <em>you&#39;re</em> not <em>your</em></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why does everyone associate the need to be likeable with a great leader? A lot of great leaders thoughout history did not win any popularity contests. For example most people thought Abraham Lincoln was a mubling moron when he was president and how his face carved is into a fucking mountain. By contrast Hitler was endorsed 9 to 1 by Germany when he was in power and led to the death of hundreds of thousands of people. It doesn&#39;t matter if Trump is likeable or what you think of his hair or how left wing media portrays him. What is important is that he protects the lives, values and finacial security of the citizens of the USA, when he fails to do that in a significant way then I will have an opinion. </p>

Keep in mind that this is only the budget we <em>admit</em>, and doesn&#39;t include other financial resources, like the reinvigorated Afghan heroin trade, or Mexican/south American drug running.</p>

<p>Our intelligence budget dwarfs everything else on the planet.  We have essentially unlimited computing power, hacks for everything that plugs into an outlet, and we meddle overtly in the affairs of every government on Earth.

    <div class="md"><p>idk how you can&#39;t see that coming when he is blasting MSM as &quot;fake news&quot; every time it doesn&#39;t agree with his narrative.  </p>

<p>he took on the integrity of all journalists in doing so.  when all news is being blasted as fake well then what is real?  what do we use to gauge real news?  </p>

<p>is it just stuff that confirms our biases or is it stuff that cites their sources and uses reliable sources?  </p>

<p>idk too much but I went to a public high school in Kentucky and learned how to properly cite sources and to look for proper sources so that my arguments held water.  or is that something we don&#39;t concern ourselves with anymore and if it doesn&#39;t fit our narrative we want to push we just call it fake as soon as it does?  fake news has no credible sources, period.  if you scroll to the bottom of a article and all they cite as their sources is other journalists talking then its FAKE NEWS.  it&#39;s a editorial at best.    real news can be wrong, that happens but it doesn&#39;t mean the whole institution is fake, but real news cites experts, real news sites credible sources.  </p>

<p>fake news is bold big time headlines that claim something extreme and then the article is fluff to back up that one thesis in the title but the sources to back up that thesis are two pundits talking to each other on a television screen... that is fake news people.  </p>

<p>My &quot;Guy&quot; is Bernie Sanders actually, so nice Talking Point you have there.  Shows you ignored the part of my comment where I said &quot;as someone who disagrees with Trump on almost every issue.&quot;  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Settle down sweetheart. </p>

<p>The other point stands, you simply weren&#39;t paying attention. As I, and several others, in this thread have nicely detailed for you. </p>

<p>So please, tell me how Trump is being treated worse than a guy who was called a secret Kenyan Muslim terrorist bent on sharia law.</p>

<p>And yes, the lengths you&#39;re going to in order to defend Trump from being called out on his bullshit makes him your guy. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>So you reference the one Mainstream source that was clearly anti-Obama </p>
</blockquote>

<p>You seem to have weirdly deleted that point about it being by far the most popular cable news network. Funny how you don&#39;t want to acknowledge that. </p>

<p>Or how about talk radio being all far right wing too?</p>

<p>Or shit like Drudge Report, etc which still gets millions of views. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>yet ignore how Trump is treated in the exact same manner by ALL Mainstream sources including plenty of Fox News shows.  You&#39;re just proving my point for me.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Hahaha, the ONLY Fox News show which is even timidly critical is Shep Smith. &quot;Plenty&quot; is a laughable statement. </p>

<p>And Obama also got shit from the major news networks, he just wasn&#39;t rage tweeting at news programs and attacking FBI directors and foreign mayors every other day. </p>

<p>Again, it&#39;s just showing what you want is for people to ignore Trumps shit. Because HOW DARE WE acknowledge the stupid things he says and does every day. We should all just kneel down at his feet am I right?!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>No, what I&#39;m asking for is journalist integrity instead of the propaganda you love pushing as facts.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Journalist integrity is reporting the facts. </p>

<p>The fact is that Trump is a dumpster fire right now. He&#39;s gotten no major legislation passed with all 3 branches on his side and instead he&#39;s rage tweeting and impeding investigations. </p>

<p>As for you claiming to be liberal, great work on torpedoing climate change protections, Wall Street reforms, and civil liberties though. BUT HER EMAILLSSSSSSS. You sure showed everyone!</p>

<p>This is basic misunderstanding of what &quot;scientific consensus&quot; means as well as what makes a climate scientist. Climate scientists include atmospheric and related scientists who study Climatology, or the study of Earth&#39;s climate conditions.</p>

<p>I think you might be misunderstanding what i&#39;m trying to say. There is no such thing as a climate scientist. Anyone claiming to be one is a pseudoscientist. Even real scientists in fields that can be explored with the scientific method do not think their models are the 100% unquesitonable truth (relativity, etc). </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Climate scientists include atmospheric and related scientists who study Climatology, or the study of Earth&#39;s climate conditions. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>A scientist is also not &#39;someone who studies something&#39;.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Studies have shown that the vast majority of scientific papers relating to climate studies agree on the basis of human-induced climate change. Here are a few links to that:
•<a href="http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/11/4/048002">http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/11/4/048002</a>

</blockquote>

<p>I reccommend reading the things you post before talking about them: </p>

<p><strong>We find that 66.4% of abstracts expressed no position on AGW, 32.6% endorsed AGW, 0.7% rejected AGW and 0.3% were uncertain about the cause of global warming. Among abstracts expressing a position on AGW, 97.1% endorsed the consensus position that humans are causing global warming.</strong> </p>

<p>Around 70% have no position on ACC, and only about 30% endorse it. The 97.1 number is a percentage of a subset, not a percentage of the entire scientific community.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This leads many people to a trap in which they believe people are telling them that CO2 is the ONLY factor in evaluating the overall climate when it&#39;s not. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m not in a trap. That&#39;s in fact the entire point. The planet and its conditions are under far too many variables and feedback loops for any manmade model to accurately predict with anything approaching real scientific precision.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;d really be interested if you could post the scientific papers you&#39;re talking about. Not all scientific articles are perfectly correct in a vacuum, some may conclude points incorrectly or use misleading methods to pursue an outcome. If you post specific examples I can take a look at them and maybe we can discuss where you&#39;re getting your sources.</p>

<p>This. This is what I find so hypocritical. How can you think that this billionaire  is going to work for the people? How do people become billionaires? By cheating, manipulating and exploiting anyone and anything in order to line their pockets.</p>
