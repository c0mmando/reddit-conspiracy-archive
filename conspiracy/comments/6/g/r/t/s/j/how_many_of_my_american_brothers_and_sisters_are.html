       Hey guys,
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm pretty sure this is my first post ever, I've been stalking for about a year or so though. To be honest, it was difficult to drop Facebook completely, to stop wasting my life reading utter nonsense or checking for likes every two minutes when I post something. Or the most annoying one, getting a notification for absolutley nothing but obviously you're back.
      </p>
      <p>
       I thought coming over to Reddit and posting, caring about karma was kinda the same thing. Also I was being selfish "Take what you can, give nothing back" or "Give them nothing, but take from them everything!".
      </p>
      <p>
       Sorry dudes, hopefully you are still with me that was a shitty introduction, basically I think I'm ready to join the fight. It seems to me thats what this is people, is a fight between good and evil, peace and choas, freedom and slavery. Literally or just against suit wearing, gringots bank, soul destroying money grabbing, child snatching goblin freemason cunts.
      </p>
      <p>
       Check out Washington DC on google maps. I ain't spoon feeding you here. White House, Washington monument, Lincoln monument, Jefferson monument, Capital hill building, Oberlysks, Pentagon, Templar cross, 5 pointed star, upside down cross, Freemason sqaure and compass, 6 pointed star of..David pehaps? my star? jokes my names not even David. and an owl, you know Egyptian Heirogryph for M. There are your clues guys check it out. Vatican has a similar thing going on, why? coincendence? or its not important?.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've been watching movies and Tv shows that I reckon would be putting suttle Gnostic symbology we've within each frame and theres a lot guys. The newest and best movie to demonstrate this, John Wick 2, I watched that with my homies and to me, theres another story being told. Educate yorself on Gnosticsm then watch it again. Try and figure out the pattern behind the red, blue and orange words every now and then. A clue, think evil. Think whos in the bank seen and the colour of the text at that point. why is it that colour? maybe I'm crazy. I'm positive John Wick 2 is telling us we have a choice to care or not. Watch it with subtitles, count the words, 1, 2, 3, 5. 3 times the sentence has 7 words, whats the context at that time? choice. look at the number plates. Jesus I'm crazy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Small soliders, 26 minutes in Archer looks at the computer goes through all the conspiracies im in to 21 years later with question reality underneath...coincedence? I'm not 24.
      </p>
      <p>
       I just saw another post about Google listening, I've been having similar experience for a while now, as I'm sure many of us have. I was crazily trying to explain my beliefs to my homies. Based on the fact NASA, after watching all there youtube videos appear full of shit to me. I think we've been duped guys.
      </p>
      <p>
       In a last effort to explain the concenses of keeping us in the dark with flat earth and whatever other bullshit, thinking of the whole theme of The Matrix. I said imagine you are an angel.
      </p>
      <p>
       They leave at midnight and I get back to reading this shit :P. Nip on R/Conspiracy/new A post, the article headline "You are an Angel".
      </p>
      <p>
       Thats obviosuly not the only time shit like this has happened, this is just the latest one, It's advertisment, posts on Facebook and Reddit, Youtube content. I believe in a lot of things brothers and sisters, coincidence ain't one of em :P. totally stole that quote...
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not saying I'm an angel, I'm just saying I'm turning my phone off in the evenings.
      </p>
      <p>
       Seriously, check out this shit. If you think it's nothing then all I have to say is.
      </p>

       Baaah (sheep noise).

       Well yeah, ofc it was designed by someone. Of course it was a frenchman. I'm joking I mean nothing by that. Do you want a sign saying this was designed to pay homage to some freaky evil thing?

       I never said the symbol was evil or freaky. I said the symbols are used to pay homeage to something evil or freaky. I think there's a real blind faith in space, NASA and modern science in general, Christianity, Islam, Judaism. I think y'all been duped.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think LBJ, JFK his funeral. Grand canyon then a lake, reference to a deluge? Hiroshyma, the mushroom cloud pic then planed drooping napalm. Antartica mountain, Ice, dome, then the map. Globe earth map, the fucking company is called globetech for god sakes. Watergate. protons and neurons, cactus? Saladin, Muslims, christians, turk crusade thing. Ferdinand Magellan then his route. Hitler, pearl harbour, nuclear power plant.

       Intesting imagery for Small soliders 1998 kids film. underneath, it says question reality. The Gorginites mission who by the way are the good guys in the movie, to "destroy peace and promote chaos." underneath question reality. John wick 2 on the wall, Question the system. choice, Think outside inside the box.

       I do think theres a rise in kids not doing what they are told, not blindly accepting bullshit. It will only get better, it's the children who will save us. If there's something going on we are prepared for whatever comes. If theres nothing going on, we have a good life we die, no harm done.

"reflection of the soul", "perception of space and our place within it. we hope through this exhibit we can provide new insights  in your understanding of the world and just possibly lead you to deeper reflect"
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes through watching the film I understand the world I live in. Santiano? Sanitation? acrostic for satan? on the two cleaners in the train station. You get two quick frames to see sanitation, why?
      </p>
      <p>
       Notice the theme of selling your soul? the devil always collects. Notice the coloured words and the sign language in the bar between John Wick and the bitch.

       Oh yeah Shiva? or the destroyer? notice the ruthless roar of the big Asian assassin fella immediately after. That dude got shot in the top of his head and did not die? reference to some godly power? I dunno. In the kingdom, Winston's Kingdom, God? The marker, holder of the soul? Royal crown on the marker and Queen Elizebeth I in the art gallery in black, are they involved? The change in music when the devil comes knocking to collect. Notice the DNA, tree of life, kabbalah cross pattern thing, it's in a frame as often as possible. Cups, glasses, bridges, fences, walls, as often as it can. Where there's blue, red will follow and vice versa, towards the end we get heavy bright vertical beams, vocal and visual references to the soul.

       It's like yo there is points in films, and tv shows recognise the context, the symbology in the frame, change in music or music that we know in our real universe, the pause to stay in the moment. At that moment they may aswell refer to you by name. Those bits are for you. The good vs Evil story is a way for people who are fighting the good fight. "Thinking outisde, inside the box", to hide a different message.

       I did actually use Grammarly, that big G let me down. I don't like G's or M's or 6's or eyes or satanic seal flick things. Now imagine all of those things represented the control. Now think 6 and 9 are interchangable as are M's and W's and E's and G's when you reflect an rotate the E its a G. The flick thing in all space logos. So enter logo in Google images and just scroll down at the ones that if just humour yourself in the thinking the rest of the word is nonsense to fool the herd.

       It's the key things above that matter, to me theres a disturbing amount but I was very stoned last night whilst scrolling through em.

       It's probs nothing and to be honest bro I'm just hoping all this is true, the idea that so many "intelligent" people have spent their lives studying nonsense because they were handed textbooks instead of strengthening their mind, body and soul is kinda funny to me :P

       What if you take all of the symbols, mix them up in a bucket and conclude that Taco Bell is a gateway to a future paradise? You can make up whatever you want, but no one else is going to take it seriously unless you can substantiate your claims. Streams of consciousness don't constitute evidence.

       I don't need to prove anything or change opinions, if you mean I should attach pics and real evidence of what I'm saying, can't do it mate. I could like but, where's the fun in that?
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm of the opinion that if something happened or is the truth then it should ALL make sense. When theres loads of discrepancies in the story then somethings going on. If there isn't the things that don't make sense about the story would not be there.
      </p>
      <p>
       I feel the brainwash comes in where people are holding on to the things that make sense to them. Yeah but look at all the things that don't.
      </p>
      <p>
       I saw an article defending the Rothchild family "The rothchild have had conspiracies over their head since the 1800" something like that. Right, if You've been called snakey for 200 years. you snakey.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you are waiting for the solid evidence you've been fooled you're gonna wait all your life and potentially waste it. look at the cracks in their fake truth everything else is irrelevant and probs bullshit. Don't think how or why just look at the cracks, the truth doesn't have so many cracks.

       NASA videos, I'm gonna make a video of all the things that don't make sense to me for my friends, AVR (Augmented Virtual Reality) glitches, harness fuck ups, delay fuck up, all round looking bullshit inside and outside ISS. "quick prove you're in space" overall sounding like they don't know what they are talking about both on ISS and on earth. Bullshitary planned questions and props, to be honest mate I don't buy that any of those people are astronauts and not actors. Morgan Freeman and William Shatner seem to think so too. Not gonna go into the moon landings..I can't make you believe man just humour youself and check it out or just have a lil faith :P.

It's like for 50+ years in pop culture we've been fed everything we need to know and do, we just gotta stop being scared. We just gotta stand up now man the game stops. We are legion, for we are many. Fear, ignorance and the sin from which all others spawned, pride keep us firmly in place.

       I just assumed you were born in generation X xD. If you weren't then fuck you for not dodging the brainwashing. I'm joking. :) Imagine when Tv's first came out and billboards, just taking it all in, Jesus Christ.

       If this just stays like this for years and years to come then thats some bullshit. I'm expecting something coming, I feel it, I read and watch that its coming, people have told me it's coming, it better come dawg.

       Heard of agenda 2030? don't know anything about it past the term. The number 23 movie Jim Carrey came 2007 all about nurmerolgy, 23 years after 2007? 2030? John Wick's car will be fixed Christmas, 2030, maybe something to look into..

       Init. Now I recognise significant numbers, they pop up a lot. It's a shame I'm not good enough at mental maths to see it and process all that shit. Did you see that movie? Jim Carrey and his son, Jesus. Admittedly, he was insane and it was a movie...

       I did actually use Grammarly, that big G let me down. I don't like G's or M's or 6's or eyes or satanic seal flick things. Now imagine all of those things represented the control. Now think 6 and 9 are interchangable as are M's and W's and E's and G's when you reflect an rotate the E its a G. The flick thing in all space logos. So enter logo in Google images and just scroll down at the ones that if just humour yourself in the thinking the rest of the word is nonsense to fool the herd.

       It's the key things above that matter, to me theres a disturbing amount but I was very stoned last night whilst scrolling through em.

       It's probs nothing and to be honest bro I'm just hoping all this is true, the idea that so many "intelligent" people have spent their lives studying nonsense because they were handed textbooks instead of strengthening their mind, body and soul is kinda funny to me :P

       But I'm probs just crazy, I didn't mean to offend earlier!

       Perhaps. :P That John Wick 2 post on r/Movies. I commented very briefly on the messages and Gnosticsm in the movie and red, blue or orange to look out for and watch again if you missed it. It got deleted.

       I dunno I think there's something there, don't take me too seriously though dawg, gotta try for humour, even if it regrettably, falls short.
