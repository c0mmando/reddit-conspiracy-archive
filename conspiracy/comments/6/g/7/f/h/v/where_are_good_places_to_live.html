        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I know people are gonna hate this shit post and probably get shit/no replies... 
Does anyone like where they live? It seems to me like most people on this sub live somewhere in the U.S. But I&#39;d be really interested if people have found somewhere that suits the way they want to live rather than make their lifestyle fit into where they live. I live in the UK. Recently found out I might need to move and I&#39;m only excited about it if there is a place in this world that exists that isn&#39;t corrupt and isn&#39;t trying to feed and stress their residents to death.</p>

<p>I do believe chemtrails are real and I do believe they are rampant in the UK as based on the research I&#39;ve done- I see them all the time. 
I also hate that no children are safe in this country, govt  and media is riddled with pedos, child services and family court is just the fucking worse and it alone is the reason I don&#39;t want to bring children into this world. When many years ago before I started to look into conspiracy- having a family of my own was absolute goals. Now I want nothing to do with it.
Where I live is the heart of farming!!! Yet there&#39;s still mcdonalds left right and centre, local food businesses and farms suffer due to the amount of warehouse farms and demand for processed foods. I want to be able to live somewhere where I can be in touch with nature rather than watching it be destroyed, breathe clean air rather than inhaling heavy metals and a government that I can actually back and be proud to support.... Does anywhere like this exist in the world? 
Ideally I want to live in woods with a pack of wolves...again sorry for the shit post, I&#39;d just be really interested to see if anyone likes where they live...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My husband can&#39;t speak it at all and he gets by fairly well somehow, hahah. It gets difficult if you have to sign up for certain things like health insurance or if you&#39;re trying to get a cellphone plan or internet. Japanese people tend to avoid speaking English like the plague but if you&#39;re lucky you&#39;ll find someone who&#39;s willing to use a few words here and there to make communication a little less challenging. As for day-to-day things, living here is completely doable without knowing any Japanese. You&#39;re also likely to eventually pick up some words and grammar so that you can order in restaurants and ask for directions and things. Most foreigners here teach and you&#39;re not required to know any Japanese for 90% of the teaching positions offered. If you&#39;re situated in Tokyo then you could probably live there for years without having used much Japanese at all. </p>

<p>A friend of mine moved there with his parents back in the 00&#39;s and lived there for four years. His father was a history teacher stateside and wanted to open a restaurant in Hawaii. He couldn&#39;t do it and couldn&#39;t get a job. My friend ended up working for minimum wage at an adult book store and the three of them scrapped by on his wages until they could move back to the mainland.</p>

We have nearly every climate and some really sparsley populated areas where you could probably literally go live with wolves and no one would know or care. The cultures of each state vary and there is basically something for everyone. Check out Live Free and Die (TV show, a lot is staged but some people literally live very similar to that). In America it is just a matter of finding what state aligns best with your ideology, then checking into which has the most laws/regulations that suit your feeling of freedom for the town you want to move to.</p>

The first edition came out in the early 2000s, they&#39;re up to their fourth edition in 2014. As the name implies, it focuses on the US. Thought you might like to look at the list of criteria for which they have collected data. Even though it&#39;s US-specific, it&#39;s food for the kind of thought you&#39;re having.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not trying to sell the book, in fact I haven&#39;t bought it myself though I&#39;ve thought about it since it came out. I just haven&#39;t had a use for it since I haven&#39;t relocated. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I live here and I&#39;m repulsed by our federal government. It&#39;s a shame that that is what people have come to think of as &quot;america.&quot; I&#39;ve thought about leaving quite a bit. But then I&#39;d be subject to the US&#39;s foreign policy which really does frighten me. </p>

<p>I will say this: I do not feel unsafe here except when in the presence of &quot;authorities,&quot; primarily police. I&#39;m curious what gives you the perception that America is unsafe? I&#39;m a lifetime resident of the same small village and we still don&#39;t lock our doors when we leave the house. There&#39;s virtually no crime. (I don&#39;t count victimless crimes such as drug arrests as real crime. There is an opiate problem here.) We don&#39;t have a local police force. </p>

<p>Closest to feeling &quot;unsafe&quot; that I get is when I think about how much it costs to get sick or injured in this country. <em>That</em> certainly leaves me feeling at the very least, insecure.</p>

I&#39;ve visited family there, went to NY and DC and stayed in Virginia. While I thought a lot of it was beautiful and interesting...It sucked lol. I almost had an asthma attack while I was staying in NY fucking lucky I didn&#39;t because that would&#39;ve been costly but I struggled to breathe while I was in the city. I felt safe while I was there but that was way back in the day when I was blissfully unaware of anything regarding the state and federal government. I feel like the US is potentially always under some sort of threat, I feel like the govt pulls on a lot of strings all around the world and lies to the masses far too much. 
I live in a similar place at the moment in the UK, very safe and nice area but I want to escape false freedom, if ya get me.</p>

<p>The situation is in a downward spiral. With no sign of getting better.  The common man is in a state between anger and depression. </p>

<p>The more the prosecutors dig into it, more they find. It&#39;s like a bottomless pit. And they barely touched the Country&#39;s Bank for Development. Petrobras is the tip of the Iceberg.</p>

<p>Ofc this country has never been known for having the best politicians. But in the last decade things became overboard.</p>

<p>Since the worker&#39;s party (whose leadership is basically composed of former commie guerrillas) rose to power, corruption became endemic. And the sums involved are insane.</p>

<p>Its no common corruption like we had in the past. Its not some guy taking a share of the public money to get rich. Its systematic pillage benefiting a power scheme that affects whole Latin America.  The thing is massive. These guys are literally sucking the country dry.</p>

<p>And where is all that money going? Well, some of it, maybe the smaller part, is going to tax havens and some are going to their fellas: the dictatorship states of Cuba, Venezuela, etc.. </p>

<p>I lived there three years and they were the worst three years of my life. I&#39;m still dealing with the fallout. Me moving to Hawaii was the worst mistake and greatest regret of my life.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My husband can&#39;t speak it at all and he gets by fairly well somehow, hahah. It gets difficult if you have to sign up for certain things like health insurance or if you&#39;re trying to get a cellphone plan or internet. Japanese people tend to avoid speaking English like the plague but if you&#39;re lucky you&#39;ll find someone who&#39;s willing to use a few words here and there to make communication a little less challenging. As for day-to-day things, living here is completely doable without knowing any Japanese. You&#39;re also likely to eventually pick up some words and grammar so that you can order in restaurants and ask for directions and things. Most foreigners here teach and you&#39;re not required to know any Japanese for 90% of the teaching positions offered. If you&#39;re situated in Tokyo then you could probably live there for years without having used much Japanese at all. </p>
