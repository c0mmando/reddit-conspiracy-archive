        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>My prediction thread: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6eu6iw/prediction_there_will_be_a_hung_parliament_after/">https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6eu6iw/prediction_there_will_be_a_hung_parliament_after/</a></p>

<p>The Tories called the election 3 years early, then did their level best to sabotage their chances of winning:-</p>

<ul>
<li>May (PM) failed to turn up at debates</li>
<li>fox hunting was brought up time and again (an annoying irrelevance to almost everyone in a time of economic hardship)</li>
<li>after the election results, many Tory MPs admitted it was the worst-run election campaign (by the Tories) in living memory, yet the Tories &quot;wanted&quot; the election</li>
</ul>

<p>So what was really happening behind the scenes?</p>

<p>The only way the establishment could stop Brexit was to introduce a hung parliament.  They got the result they wanted.  Think about this:-</p>

<ul>
<li>Theresa May was pro-Remain (in the EU) before she was PM</li>
<li>Cameron resigned soon after the Brexit result last year.  He was replaced by a Remainer (May), even though Gove and Johnson were Leavers who were in the running to be new PM.  This was the first obvious clue that the establishment were to get their way</li>
<li>then within a year of being PM, and 3 years before the next scheduled election, May announces a snap election and then the Tories do their best to look bad</li>
</ul>

<p>Brexit is on permanent ice now, OR they will have the softest of Brexits &quot;in name only&quot; as they will say that the Tories - who are a false proxy for the 52% who actually voted Brexit - &quot;don&#39;t have a mandate to provide a hard Brexit&quot;.   </p>

<p>We&#39;re being so obviously played here.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the EU referendum vote was a &quot;pressure valve&quot;.   The establishment are globalists who are fearful of a nationalistic movement.  They were right - 52% of the British public voted for nationalism (essentially).  They then had to deal with following through on Brexit - which is what we are witnessing now.  I think it also might be a signal to other countries - that globalism always wins.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good analysis! Makes sense that your theory a week ago proved true.</p>

<p>Can I ask a question that has me confused? I&#39;m American, so I don&#39;t understand your politics much, fyi. What do you think about the two terror attacks before the snap election? I didn&#39;t look into them much other than thinking that they showed all the signs of false flags. Why would tptb stage the false flags which might make ppl want to vote for May? The terror attacks confuse me because it doesn&#39;t seem to fit into the narrative that makes sense: remainer May takes over to stall brexit, calls for a snap election 3 years early (why would any politician/party give up its power??) only to run a lackluster campaign that gave zero reasons to vote for her party. I just don&#39;t get where the terror attacks come into play. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>While I agree that nobody can be as stupid as May, and there was definitely some malice involved. I don&#39;t think what you&#39;re saying makes sense given the following:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The markets didn&#39;t account for a hung parliament, the money was on a marginal Conservative win. </p></li>
<li><p>Article 50 has already been put in motion with negotiations due to start in just over a week. Banks and other businesses are already leaving the UK. </p></li>
<li><p>Cameron stepped down as PM even though he was anti-Brexit and could have been the fall guy and negotiated a soft Brexit. </p></li>
<li><p>Hung parliament means uncertainly and lack of control, this in turn means there might be another election and a potential Labour government as in the 70&#39;s.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>I think you&#39;re on the right track though. I could be convinced that May and her cronies were trying to throw the election in order to give Labour the very difficult task of negotiating Brexit, to return as a much stronger party in a few years.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just look at it that Labour and Tories are two different sides of the same coin (the establishment).  The establishment are openly pro-EU and they had to do something before actual Brexit negotiations begin (in 11 days&#39; time).  Predictably (and openly), all politicians are now talking about a &quot;soft Brexit&quot; - even Farage is.  They (the establishment) want to keep Freedom of Movement at any cost.  I really doubt FOM will be removed now, and that&#39;s really the central idea of Brexit - to control immigration.  So what a &quot;soft Brexit&quot; means is a Brexit in name only.  The UK won&#39;t technically be a fully-paid up member, but they will keep FOM, they will pay fees in some other way, and will probably continue to trade under the EU block in some way too - maybe as an EEA member.  </p>

<p>They ARE openly pro-EU.  I&#39;m from the UK - Labour are openly pro-EU, Tories (all but minority of backbenchers) are openly pro-EU.  When they talk of Brexit, it&#39;s always unenthusiastically and &quot;for the will of the people&quot; (as in, &quot;it&#39;s not something I&#39;d do, but hey, they voted for it&quot;).  In the run up to the EU referendum, all the mainstream parties were pro-EU with some lone voices siding with UKIP (who are constantly criticised by the MSM as being &quot;racist&quot; for wanting policies that the vast majority of 200+ countries around the world get to have).  </p>

<p>I don&#39;t think Corbyn will be allowed to form a minority government.  It looks like Tories + DUP in a very weakened state.  Now the UK have zero credibility in Brexit negotiations.  Job. Done.  Brexit is a lame duck.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for this. I thought the snap election seemed really weird, but I know too little about UK government/politics to figure it out. I couldn&#39;t understand why they seemed to want to give away power to Corbyn and his ilk with an early election that wasn&#39;t necessary. This makes a lot of sense though. </p>

<p>On the other hand if it was by design that this election was to destroy brexit and defang the nationalist movements in the UK, she will hold on to power and there will not be a single dissenting voice. That is what will indicate to me, that your theory has legs.</p>

<p>This was to appease the UKIP vote which was 4,000,000+ in the 2015 election.  The Tories promised a referendum in the run-up to the 2015 election (if you vote Tory, we&#39;ll give you an EU referendum).  It worked in that they got in power.  You&#39;re right - they didn&#39;t want the EU referendum, and BOY did they (the establishment) campaign hard against the Brexit vote.  </p>

<blockquote>

<p>They <em>chose</em> to pick an election date just days <em>before</em> Brexit negotiations.  They are already ruling out a &quot;hard Brexit&quot; - so predictable.  It&#39;s like clockwork.</p>

<p>This part of your analysis is completely off base. A soft Brexit isn&#39;t possible because the EU refuses to negotiate until the UK actually pulls the trigger. At that point the UK will have a vastly worsened bargaining position. This problem is one reason so little progress on the Brexit is being made. There&#39;s too much uncertainty. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>IMO Theresa May fucked up her campaign by being complacent and misjudging the mood of the electorate, similar to what happened to Hillary Clinton. Brexit was just a secondary concern - she was really interested in getting a mandate to pursue her manifesto policies, and it wouldn&#39;t make sense to cripple your party in parliament to achieve that.</p>

<p>Granted, the Tories (under Cameron) probably didn&#39;t want to leave the EU in the first place, but they will still deliver - it would be electoral suicide if they didn&#39;t. Freedom of movement is dead (even if they maintain similar levels of immigration...) and they will probably try to just retain a good trade relationship with the EU. And assuming the Tories remain in power, they will slowly untangle the UK from other institutions like the Council of Europe/ECHR/etc.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>She already had a mandate. The Tories had a majority.   So what do they do? Call an election, then - in the words of many of their MPs - carry out the worst election campaign in their history - and produce a hung parliament.  Using the word &quot;complacency&quot; is swallowing the lie.  No party is ever complacent in an election, especially if they want to increase a majority.  </p>

<p>You say nothing will change in regards to Brexit, yet even David Davies (Brexit minister) says this result has severely weakened their negotiations.  They&#39;re certainly talking as I&#39;d expect them to if they (the establishment) wanted to use this result against Brexit.</p>
