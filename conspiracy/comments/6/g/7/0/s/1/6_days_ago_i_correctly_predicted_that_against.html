       The Tories called the election 3 years early, then did their level best to sabotage their chances of winning:-
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        May (PM) failed to turn up at debates
       </li>
       <li>
        fox hunting was brought up time and again (an annoying irrelevance to almost everyone in a time of economic hardship)
       </li>
       <li>
        after the election results, many Tory MPs admitted it was the worst-run election campaign (by the Tories) in living memory, yet the Tories "wanted" the election
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       So what was really happening behind the scenes?
      </p>
      <p>
       The only way the establishment could stop Brexit was to introduce a hung parliament.  They got the result they wanted.  Think about this:-
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Theresa May was pro-Remain (in the EU) before she was PM
       </li>
       <li>
        Cameron resigned soon after the Brexit result last year.  He was replaced by a Remainer (May), even though Gove and Johnson were Leavers who were in the running to be new PM.  This was the first obvious clue that the establishment were to get their way
       </li>
       <li>
        then within a year of being PM, and 3 years before the next scheduled election, May announces a snap election and then the Tories do their best to look bad
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Brexit is on permanent ice now, OR they will have the softest of Brexits "in name only" as they will say that the Tories - who are a false proxy for the 52% who actually voted Brexit - "don't have a mandate to provide a hard Brexit".
      </p>
      <p>
       We're being so obviously played here.

       I think the EU referendum vote was a "pressure valve".   The establishment are globalists who are fearful of a nationalistic movement.  They were right - 52% of the British public voted for nationalism (essentially).  They then had to deal with following through on Brexit - which is what we are witnessing now.  I think it also might be a signal to other countries - that globalism always wins.

       I think elites know how to gain power whether there is a brexit or not, they need the divide and conquer strategy tho, and they need regular people to fight over meaningless scandals, so we waste our time doing anything besides what we need to do, guillotine the rich.

       Good analysis! Makes sense that your theory a week ago proved true.
      </p>
      <p>
       Can I ask a question that has me confused? I'm American, so I don't understand your politics much, fyi. What do you think about the two terror attacks before the snap election? I didn't look into them much other than thinking that they showed all the signs of false flags. Why would tptb stage the false flags which might make ppl want to vote for May? The terror attacks confuse me because it doesn't seem to fit into the narrative that makes sense: remainer May takes over to stall brexit, calls for a snap election 3 years early (why would any politician/party give up its power??) only to run a lackluster campaign that gave zero reasons to vote for her party. I just don't get where the terror attacks come into play.

       I tend to hold the opposite view of "Never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity" (Hanlon's razor) when it comes to politicians - who spend most of their time deceiving the public.  The official reason why the Tories held and early election as to INCREASE their majority - then they did their level best to look bad.  There is something deliberate about it all.

       They wanted to try to destroy Labour and the SNP - Scottish independence movement.

       My conspiracy is that May wanted to lose this election, Labour and other parties voted in and they don't handle Brexit well... Tories win by a landslide next time and are in for another 8+ years.

       I'm just saying that the "shot in the foot" was deliberate.  She's now "defanged" Brexit and predictably today we're seeing Nigel Farage and others saying that Brexit is dead in the water.  Job done.

       The EU is a manifestation of the globalist elite network.  It's a plank toward a world government - at the very least, it's a test case.  The EU has impoverished southern Europe (Spain, Italy, Greece, Portugal) - you should ask any young person in those countries what they think of the EU.

       But they don't have the autonomy to deal with those problems economically.  The EU is keeping Greece impoverished for decades to come with no way for Greece to devalue its own currency (as it doesn't have its own currency) - no tools to help itself.

       Germany exploits the undervalued Euro currency to gain trade advantage and increase their own GDP at the expense of the financially less well off nations in the EU. Greece bares some responsibility for its own problems, but the fact is they would have been inevitable with the system in place continuing on its current tack.

       She's a Remainer.  Only when she became PM did she say that she had to honour the public vote.  Her own opinion is that she wants the UK to remain in the EU.  However, more importantly, it's
       <em>
        the establishment
       </em>
       that want to remain in the EU.  May is just one person - she's simply following orders.

       She's been very open with her pro-EU views for years, particularly in the run-up to the EU referendum.  I was surprised they made her PM - unless she's there to steer the UK away from Brexit in a stealthy way.

       While I agree that nobody can be as stupid as May, and there was definitely some malice involved. I don't think what you're saying makes sense given the following:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         The markets didn't account for a hung parliament, the money was on a marginal Conservative win.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Article 50 has already been put in motion with negotiations due to start in just over a week. Banks and other businesses are already leaving the UK.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Cameron stepped down as PM even though he was anti-Brexit and could have been the fall guy and negotiated a soft Brexit.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Hung parliament means uncertainly and lack of control, this in turn means there might be another election and a potential Labour government as in the 70's.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       I think you're on the right track though. I could be convinced that May and her cronies were trying to throw the election in order to give Labour the very difficult task of negotiating Brexit, to return as a much stronger party in a few years.

       I just look at it that Labour and Tories are two different sides of the same coin (the establishment).  The establishment are openly pro-EU and they had to do something before actual Brexit negotiations begin (in 11 days' time).  Predictably (and openly), all politicians are now talking about a "soft Brexit" - even Farage is.  They (the establishment) want to keep Freedom of Movement at any cost.  I really doubt FOM will be removed now, and that's really the central idea of Brexit - to control immigration.  So what a "soft Brexit" means is a Brexit in name only.  The UK won't technically be a fully-paid up member, but they will keep FOM, they will pay fees in some other way, and will probably continue to trade under the EU block in some way too - maybe as an EEA member.

       They ARE openly pro-EU.  I'm from the UK - Labour are openly pro-EU, Tories (all but minority of backbenchers) are openly pro-EU.  When they talk of Brexit, it's always unenthusiastically and "for the will of the people" (as in, "it's not something I'd do, but hey, they voted for it").  In the run up to the EU referendum, all the mainstream parties were pro-EU with some lone voices siding with UKIP (who are constantly criticised by the MSM as being "racist" for wanting policies that the vast majority of 200+ countries around the world get to have).
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think Corbyn will be allowed to form a minority government.  It looks like Tories + DUP in a very weakened state.  Now the UK have zero credibility in Brexit negotiations.  Job. Done.  Brexit is a lame duck.

       Thanks for this. I thought the snap election seemed really weird, but I know too little about UK government/politics to figure it out. I couldn't understand why they seemed to want to give away power to Corbyn and his ilk with an early election that wasn't necessary. This makes a lot of sense though.

       What will be key is whether she resigns and a new leader takes over. Under any other circumstance her job is untenable, any leader who called an election then failed as spectacularly as her would be forced to resign.
      </p>
      <p>
       On the other hand if it was by design that this election was to destroy brexit and defang the nationalist movements in the UK, she will hold on to power and there will not be a single dissenting voice. That is what will indicate to me, that your theory has legs.

       Shouldn't a referendum take priority over what the party in power can do? How can they consider themselves democratic if they overturn a referendum, which the most directly democratic thing possible?

       The Tories threw the election because the establishment doesn't want its preferred party to take the rap for when it all goes horribly wrong for the average person.
      </p>
      <p>
       There wouldn't even have
       <em>
        been
       </em>
       a referendum if the establishment didn't want the UK out of the EU. The Tories were not forced to hold that referendum, nor were they forced to be bound by the results.
      </p>
      <p>
       They
       <em>
        chose
       </em>
       to hold the referendum, they chose to trigger Article 50, and now they
       <em>
        choose
       </em>
       to distance themselves from the results by trying to throw the election.
      </p>
      <p>
       They know damn well the people are not going to be pleased with the result, and they would much rather be able to blame Corbyn for screwing it up.

       This was to appease the UKIP vote which was 4,000,000+ in the 2015 election.  The Tories promised a referendum in the run-up to the 2015 election (if you vote Tory, we'll give you an EU referendum).  It worked in that they got in power.  You're right - they didn't want the EU referendum, and BOY did they (the establishment) campaign hard against the Brexit vote.

       I think the EU (as corrupt and incompetent as it is) is actually good for one thing: It regulates businesses slightly better than a "anti-establishment, independent" British government would be willing to, and it protects our human rights because obeying the European Court of Human Rights is a condition for EU membership, and that stops May's planned internet surveillance and the Snooper's Charter.

       The EU are part of the NWO.  You think the EU wasn't (isn't) part of PRISM? It's naive to think snooping isn't already happening when Snowden already revealed it is.  If you think the EU are some benevolent institution, I'm honestly not sure why you're browsing

       I don't think I said that? I meant it was obvious that the Tories weren't going to get the majority and get the easy win. Most predictions for the week prior to the elections had it as a hung parliament or coalition.
      </p>
      <p>
       Talk of May stepping down I believe I first saw on the news around the same time, it was largely expected to be the outcome of the election.
      </p>
      <p>
       So not so much they threw it, but because of their over confidence and extremely bad month of politicking many many people were expecting it.

      <p>
       This part of your analysis is completely off base. A soft Brexit isn't possible because the EU refuses to negotiate until the UK actually pulls the trigger. At that point the UK will have a vastly worsened bargaining position. This problem is one reason so little progress on the Brexit is being made. There's too much uncertainty.

       IMO Theresa May fucked up her campaign by being complacent and misjudging the mood of the electorate, similar to what happened to Hillary Clinton. Brexit was just a secondary concern - she was really interested in getting a mandate to pursue her manifesto policies, and it wouldn't make sense to cripple your party in parliament to achieve that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Granted, the Tories (under Cameron) probably didn't want to leave the EU in the first place, but they will still deliver - it would be electoral suicide if they didn't. Freedom of movement is dead (even if they maintain similar levels of immigration...) and they will probably try to just retain a good trade relationship with the EU. And assuming the Tories remain in power, they will slowly untangle the UK from other institutions like the Council of Europe/ECHR/etc.

       She already had a mandate. The Tories had a majority.   So what do they do? Call an election, then - in the words of many of their MPs - carry out the worst election campaign in their history - and produce a hung parliament.  Using the word "complacency" is swallowing the lie.  No party is ever complacent in an election, especially if they want to increase a majority.
      </p>
      <p>
       You say nothing will change in regards to Brexit, yet even David Davies (Brexit minister) says this result has severely weakened their negotiations.  They're certainly talking as I'd expect them to if they (the establishment) wanted to use this result against Brexit.
