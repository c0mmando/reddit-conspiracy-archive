       It was strongly suggested before that Omar Mateen was a crisis actor.  I can't really find a good link on it, but that may get you started on some good research.

       , I'm wondering if they were providing security at the arena the night the attack occurred as well. I can't find any info on that so far though.

       G4S have the first private police force in Lincolnshire I believe - basically the police force outsourced the running of a police station to them. They used to be called Securicor over here and were basically a running joke for how bad they were at their job. These are very dodgy people with numerous black marks against their name.

       Great finds. Interesting how these Muslim terror attacks are being promoted by the government and then used not against Muslims but against privacy, liberty, etc.

       The Orlando police killed at least 30 of the people in the club. The gay Muslim just gave them the excuse.

       I posted my theory about  how he was manipulatedâ€‹ into doing the shooting  while it was still fresh in memory. I'll repost so you guys can see and give thoughts and hopefully redpill one or two.
      </p>
      <p>
       My personal theory on the pulse nightclub shooting.
      </p>
      <p>
       Under surveillance for years, Mateen was selected for use in a Operation on U.S. soil. Over a year's work was required to convince him of the legitimacy of his role. Once on board, the operation started for him months before the actual shooting. What really happened, and why?
      </p>
      <p>
       Once it was determined that his views sided with the new islamic reform that is gaining ground every day, he was contacted by agents posing as a sleeper cell in the U.S. Their actions were to be the Herald that unveiled the cleansing fire of Allah that will sweep across the country. He was told that he was to play a central role in the coming war on american soil. His celebrity in Love City Jalalabad and The Big Fix, His father's connections inside the American and Afghanistan Government, and his own inside G4S were used to make him feel too important to lose. That he would survive, the only thing he needed to do was to prove his loyalty.
      </p>
      <p>
       He started visiting the pulse nightclub many months before the night of the shooting. Learn the building, build his own hate against them and most importantly become a recognizable face. Eventually, the call was made to begin preparation for the shooting. The plan given to him was simple and foolproof.
      </p>
      <p>
       He was to attack the the nightclub just before closing. Open fire and create some casualties, but the primary goal was to isolate and contain a large number of survivors. A hostage situation would be needed for him to escape. He was told that ally's inside the club would be ready to help facilitate this by sealing the emergency exits from the outside. Once the situation was under his control, He was to wait.
      </p>
      <p>
       The last stage, and true goal was to occur once a large enough number of first responders amassed outside, several suicide vests and one car bomb where to detonate, killing the majority of them. Once the explosions occurred, Mateen was to remove his mask and outer layer of clothing away from living eyes and cameras. Then, as a known face, he would easily escape with the crowd.
      </p>
      <p>
       The explosions never came, and he was killed. Just as planned by his handlers. The cleanup was simple as there was no connection to any known group. A select few trusted actors will help display the official narrative.The rest would be speculation but nothing could ever be proven. Nothing ever WILL be proven because there is no evidence of these events in existence. He was just a confused and distraught boy who did not know if he was gay or a ISIS lone wolf.
      </p>
      <p>
       Who would manipulate someone to do this? WHY? There is no one official group behind this. Individuals Inside and out of the government are using paid operatives to complete their personal goals. That goal for now is control, but that's just the first part of the plan. The influx of refugees and additional created attacks will give more power to the things you already see. Militarized police, increased surveillance, unarm the people. I have my theories, but I dont know whats coming after that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do your own research and place the pieces together. This is truth we deserve to know it even if it cannot be proven.

       How did you came to that conclusion exactly? Especially in regards to the car bomb and suicide vests? Anything that pointed you in that direction if I may ask?
      </p>

       Or is it only speculations from your side? Genuinely curious here

       Well things were still happening there were many claims of first-hand from inside the club of his phone usage during the event. Apparently while on the phone he either threatened police with suicide vest or spoke to someone in reference to them.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm at work at the moment and don't have time to dig around for that information and I don't know where I remember it from firsthand.. once I cut loose from here I will see what I can find tonight.
