I thought there was a collective understanding that both sides are captured by the global banking cartels and that mainstream politics was simply a sideshow to keep us distracted/not talking about the issues that are really in play.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Luke from &quot;We Are Change&quot; was there, has been reporting on it, and has uploaded videos to his Youtube page.  As a comment already stated...it&#39;s mostly &quot;No Comment&quot; BS as usual, but Luke was able to get a few comments on record and even an interview with the &quot;youngest Bilderberger&quot;...the young guy who is trying to clean up the oceans.  Not saying We Are Change got deep into Bilderberg, just saying it is the best 2017 content I have found.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Probably because it&#39;s always been &quot;secret&quot; &amp; nothing has ever been leaked. I think some of us have <em>a clue</em> as to what we <em>think</em> it&#39;s about: more control, ie, false flags, fear/chaos, etc. </p>

<p>But does it matter? <em>NO</em>, because the &#39;majority&#39; are tired of the &#39;few&#39; trashing (humanity &amp;) the planet.</p>

When there is no real information about what is being discussed, it&#39;s essentially just guesses and shit-posting. Unless there&#39;s a leak, there&#39;s really not much to discussion.

    <div class="md"><p>Its funny becuse i live in sweden. And one politician from center partie named annie lööv was invided to the meeting. That partie has barly 6 percent of the votes. After the meeting they are reporting that she can become the new prime minister in sweden next year election time. They say the center has risen from 6 percent to over 13 percent in these two months. And that she might rule the country in coallition with three other right wing polycis. My local paper just wrote a piece on her and that meeting and they tell us all how wonderful that meeting is for her since she will learn alot from elite players in politics and establish conntacs. Hahaha funny they domt mention the game is rigged. Its all fucking rigged. Just watch swedens center next year and what happends to them. Bilderberg dont make no decions my ass. Its all rigged</p>
