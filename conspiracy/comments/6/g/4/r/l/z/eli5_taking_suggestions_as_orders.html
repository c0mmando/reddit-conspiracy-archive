<blockquote>
<p>OKAY. FAIR ENOUGH. IF THE PRESIDENT WANTED TO STOP AN INVESTIGATION, HOW WOULD HE DO THAT? KNOWING IT IS AN ONGOING CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION, OR COUNTERINTELLIGENCE INVESTIGATION, WOULD THAT BE A MATTER OF TRYING TO GO TO YOU, YOU PERCEIVE, TO SAY YOU MAKE IT STOP BECAUSE HE DIDN&#39;T HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO STOP, OR HOW WOULD THE PRESIDENT MAKE AN ONGOING INVESTIGATION STOP?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Comey:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;M NOT A LEGAL SCHOLAR. SO SMARTER PEOPLE ANSWER THIS BETTER, BUT I THINK AS A LEGAL MATTER, PRESIDENT IS AHEAD OF THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH, AND COULD DIRECT IN THEORY WE HAVE IMPORTANT NORMS AGAINST THIS, BUT DIRECT THAT ANYBODY BE INVESTIGATED OR ANYBODY NOT BE INVESTIGATED, I THINK HE HAS THE LOCAL AUTHORITY, OF US ULTIMATELY REPORT IN THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH UP TO THE PRESIDENT.</p>

<p>James Lankford:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>WOULD THAT BE TO YOU, TO THE GENERAL? TO WHO HE WOULD DO THAT.</p>

And thanks for the transcript.</p>

<p>That seems like they were discussing whether the president COULD end an investigation, within his authority as chief executive (seemingly yes), but sheds no light on whether he issued an order to do so or not.</p>

<p>If he took it as an order, and the president can give such an order and he is required to follow it, then why didn&#39;t he follow it?</p>

<p>He didn&#39;t follow it and as such didn&#39;t take it as an order. As was pointed out in the testimony, Trump had made the same sentiments publicly in the same timeframe. In other words, not only was it not taken as an order, it was understood to be the general feeling Trump had at the time.</p>

<p>There was never a case of feeling pressured to end it or having someone end it. As Comey also stated, Trump had only mentioned it once and there was never any follow-up with either Trump or through any third party. </p>
