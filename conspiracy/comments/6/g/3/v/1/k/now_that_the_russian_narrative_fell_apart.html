       Pretty much zero. The trail he will likely follow won't involve just one side. It's all interconnected. And where those emails actually originated from will probably be the first step. I don't think a special counsel will rely on the reports of a third party company that's outside the FBI, to start with.

       no, which is why the democrats wrote a letter all pissed off because Mueller can go and investigate whatever he wants. He can start investigating Lynch/Clinton if he wants, so by no means with the investigation get shut down. It will just shift in its direction into whatever is more relevant.

       I do agree that Congress is almost entirely compromised by the flow of money, but do you think it could potentially be that their allegiance is to someone other than Russia, such as malevolent forces within the US looking for a scapegoat, or perhaps some international group of elites who live unhinged from state allegiances?

       I always understood the situation to be that key figures within the US established relationships with key figures in the Soviet Union, the oligarghs, in an attempt to shift all economic power away from the Soviet Union, allowing the oligarchs to become something of public heroes, only to have Putin try to strip them of power when he came to power.
      </p>
      <p>
       My best guess as to the current situation, when framed from that perspective, would be that there are two camps within Russia and the US; those who supported the oligarchs in the US, with the oligarchs; and nationalist groups within the US and Russia. This is a far cloudier image, though in my opinion it's a more realistic one as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       The further we carry on with globalization, the more the lines become blurred, and the less important loyalties to a sovereign state become. I truly feel as though we are witnessing the advent of a war between globalists and nationalists, and that there are both benevolent and maligned forces in both the US and Russia.

       Oh well that has been my opinion since 2008.  The war is between the nationalists with a global agenda who want to promote national and cultural differences for control purposes  and the globalists who seek a lessening of national and native cultural identities for control purposes.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are other differences as well of course and the

      <p>
       non-nationalists globalists do seek some environmental controls and a few crumbs to the masses
      </p>
      <p>
       while the national globalists prefer simple violence and no rules on humanitarian and environmental policies.
      </p>
      <p>
       Corporate/oligarch interests were initially focusing on co-opting rules that protected humans and the planet but switched to paring up with Russia and going for it all in one bite.

       (b) The Special Counsel is authorized to conduct the investigation confinned by then-FBI Director James 8. Corney in testimony before the House Permanent Select Committee on
Intelligence on March 20, 2017, including:
      </p>
      <p>
       (i) any links and/or coordination between the Russian government and individuals associated with the campaign of President Donald Trump; and

       As far as I know, it hasn't fallen apart.  The bit about Russia changing election vote counts, that was false.  But their use of paid trolls and selective leaks to get the opponent that they want to try and influence country, that was definitely not knocked down.
