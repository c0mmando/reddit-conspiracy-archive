        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Collusion.</p>

<p>We have insane amounts of evidence against many of our sinister rulers. Where are the arrests????? I demand justice be service Trump. Why isn&#39;t justice being served? </p>

<p>I&#39;m sick of waiting. I&#39;ve been waiting since George W Bush for this country to improve but I found out all they were doing was buying time so I pretty much lost 16 years in waiting. </p>

<p>It is 5 months into Trump&#39;s presidency. If Trump is serious, we need to release ETI info NOW, our hidden technology NOW, and our hidden resources NOW plus drain the swamp NOW. </p>

<p>One thing we do which is very stupid is wait for the perfect opportunity to MAGA instead of just MAGAing all day every day. If there are any repercussions from MAGAing, we will deal with them as we come and this is much better than sitting around doing nothing. </p>

<p>Let&#39;s go Trump. The whole world is in extreme pain and needs you to do what you promised for relief and property. </p>

<p>I know every major circle of power watches these subs so pass on the message. We are ready for truth and progress. We aren&#39;t little kids. We don&#39;t panic. Just do it already so we can get the fuck on with our lives the way it was supposed to be lived (in a steady pace of progress). Most everything we ate from the last 2 presidents led us to regress and we will no longer stand for slow motion progress as is happenign with marijuana legalization. At this point, full legalization will happen in 75 years from now. That is unacceptable and shouldn&#39;t even be counted as progress since its so slow. </p>

<p>Pretty soon we are going to hit the streets. In fact, we should do that right now. We need to blow the fucking roof out of DC (figuratively speaking) by bombarding them with angry citizens 24/7. We should call our rulers (phone numbers on google) 24/7 demanding that they step down. All the pressure has a &quot;cause and effect&quot; pattern and with enough pressure, maybe we might get what we want but if that pressure keeps increasing, we are surely going to get what we want. </p>

<p>So, whoever is reading this board on behalf of Trump, tell him to haul ass before the people lose faith in him. There are 7 billion angry people across the world ready to raise hell. The whole world is dissatisfied and ready to put a boot up all of your asses so you better hurry the fuck up. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Like I said, if collusion exists, it likely exists independent of party lines. This is possible at any point in the chain. People always look at those at the top when it could just as easily be middle management doing most of the leg work. </p>

<p>But as for why they didn&#39;t mention it...if you were investigating someone would you tell them? From an intelligence gathering standpoint it doesn&#39;t make much sense at all to publicize most investigations into any person or entity. </p>
