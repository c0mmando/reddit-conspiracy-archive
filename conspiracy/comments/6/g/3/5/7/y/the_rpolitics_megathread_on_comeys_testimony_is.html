       I can't wait until the bombshell that "Russia hacked the election" is true but only in the sense that Crowdstrike and DNC fabrication Guccifer 2.0 were involved. Russian fingerprints... In other words Anti-Putin Russian(Ukrainian) fingerprints.

       The bombshell is more likely to be obstruction of justice by potus(same thing nixon did).
      </p>
      <p>
       The russian collusion was likely underlings and trump tried to cover it up.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if no collusion is ever proven, the obstruction is obvious.

       That's completely wrong.  The president can absolutely obstruct justice.  The FBI director does work at the pleasure of the POTUS, but they can't interfere in an investigation.  And pardoning is also completely separate.

       No you trust this Harvard law professor.  Other such professors have said differently yet you don't give there views any credence so his postition as a Harvard law professor really doesn't appear to be the reason you agree with him.

       Ignoring the obvious idiocy in saying the POTUS can't obstruct justice, what he
       <em>
        can
       </em>
       do and what is morally right and intelligent are two completely different things. Yes he can pardon people, that doesn't mean he should go around throwing them out to try to protect those loyal to him from justice. Also I'll point out you can't pardon something before an investigation and charge is pushed through, so trying to block an investigation isn't pardoning.

       Care to point where he says that?
      </p>
      <p>
       Ill just quote there here.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        For those who didn't watch the testimony Comey made it clear the top people at the FBI had to have a discussion about this, because strictly speaking, the FBI is investigating Trumps Campaign, which Trump lead as it was his campaign. Comey admits that it is also reasonable to say that the President IS under an umbrella investigation via his campaign. But it's also possible to be very literal and claim the president himself is not explicitly under a limited investigation.
       </p>
       <p>
        Direct quote
"One of the members of the leadership team had a view that although it was technically true, we did not have a counter-intelligence file case open on then-President-elect Trump, his concern was that because we're looking at the potential — again that's the subject of the investigation — coordination between the campaign and Russia, because it was President Trump — President-elect Trump's campaign, this person's view was inevitably his behavior, his conduct will fall within the scope of that work. And so he was reluctant to make the statement that I made. I disagreed," Comey said. "I thought it was fair to say what was literally true — there is not a counter-intelligence investigation of Mr. Trump — and I decided in the moment to say it given the nature of our conversation."
       </p>
       <p>
        For those who did not watch, look at the very last line: Comey repeatedly testified that multiple conversations caught him so off guard he did what he could to end them the best way he could.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        “I take the president at his word that I was fired because of the Russia investigation,” Mr Comey told the Senate Intelligence Committee in a public hearing. “Something about the way I was conducting it, the president felt, created pressure on him he wanted to relieve.”
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       That is pretty clear obstruction. Comey did say he wanted to stop short of making conclusions and will leave that for investigators. Since he is a private citizen now.

       Can't the agency known as the FBI still conduct investigations without Mr. Comey?
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean, he's not the ONLY agent, right? There would be one or two others left after he was fired to continue the investigation. Right?
      </p>
      <p>
       So how does removing one person from an investigation being performed by team of people obstruct said investigation?
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not like he secreted evidence away that was key to the investigation that only he can access or offer up to the investigators.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe it was a statement to others? "Investigate me and I'll fire you." But he hasn't fired any other the other investigators has he?

       Two things. First, that exact argument was addressed. I cant remember who said it and I dont want to watch the whole interview again to find that but its there.
      </p>
      <p>
       Second and more importantly, the firing itself was not the entirety. He asked comey to drop the investigation, then fired him when he didn't. So firing the director didnt/wouldnt stop the investigation but asking the director to stop the investigation would stop the investigation(if the director followed what POTUS implied). The obstruction is this:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Comey:"..Commonsense told me that what's going on here is he's trying to get something here for granting me the chance to stay in my job." 
Question: "Had the president got what he wanted and what he asked of you, what would have been the effect on the investigation?" 
Comey: "We would have dropped an open criminal investigation." 
Question: Do you believe you were fired over the russia investigation? &gt;Comey: "Yes, because I've seen the president say so" 
Comey: "And although the law required no reason at all to fire an FBI director, the administration then chose to defame me and more importantly the FBI by saying that the organization was in disarray, that is was poorly led - that the workforce had lost confidence in their leader. Those were lies, plain and simple."
KING: "...when a president of the United States in the Oval Office says something like “I hope” or “I suggest” or — or “would you,” do you take that as a — as a — as a directive?" 
COMEY: Yes. Yes, it rings in my ear as kind of, “Will no one rid me of this meddlesome priest?” 
KING: "I was just going to quote that. In 1170, December 29, Henry II said, “Who will rid me of this meddlesome priest?” and then, the next day, he was killed — Thomas Becket. That’s exactly the same situation. You’re — we’re thinking along the same lines."

       I have looked, and all I have found is him admitting to "interpreting" what Trump said as orders.

       But I'm pretty sure the use of "I hope this will go away" precludes the notion of it being an order.

       If true, then a very strong case indeed till need to be made that "I hope" is persuasion.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean if he had topped it off with a "for your sake..." Or something actually incentivising Comey to comply, this would be a different story. If I say I hope someone does a thing, then they do that thing, I'm not responsible for their actions. Even if I have authority over them.

       Well then you should really watch comey's testimony. Because the employment matter was already settled weeks before and trump brings it up over that dinner again. Then says he hopes he can see his way to letting flynn go. If a toddler asked me how obstruction of justice worked, this is the type of story id tell them. Plain as day.

       Here some more quotes for you to mull over.
      </p>
      <p>
       Comey:"..Commonsense told me that what's going on here is he's trying to get something here for granting me the chance to stay in my job."
Question: "Had the president got what he wanted and what he asked of you, what would have been the effect on the investigation?"
Comey: "We would have dropped an open criminal investigation."
Question: Do you believe you were fired over the russia investigation?
Comey: "Yes, because I've seen the president say so"
Comey: "And although the law required no reason at all to fire an FBI director, the administration then chose to defame me and more importantly the FBI by saying that the organization was in disarray, that is was poorly led - that the workforce had lost confidence in their leader. Those were lies, plain and simple."
      </p>
      <p>
       KING: "...when a president of the United States in the Oval Office says something like “I hope” or “I suggest” or — or “would you,” do you take that as a — as a — as a directive?"
COMEY: Yes. Yes, it rings in my ear as kind of, “Will no one rid me of this meddlesome priest?”
KING: "I was just going to quote that. In 1170, December 29, Henry II said, “Who will rid me of this meddlesome priest?” and then, the next day, he was killed — Thomas Becket. That’s exactly the same situation. You’re — we’re thinking along the same lines."

       Context matters when considering the words the POTUS tells comey.

       Not really. Potus can fire who he wants and never gave a direct order. If you want an obstruction of justice how about the quote where Comey explicitly says she did?

       Direct orders are not necessary for obsrutction of justice. Failing to attempt to persuade someone is obstruction of justice.

        "(b) Whoever knowingly uses intimidation, threatens, or corruptly persuades another person, or attempts to do so, or engages in misleading conduct toward another person, with intent to— (1) influence, delay, or prevent the testimony of any person in an official proceeding; (2) cause or induce any person to— (A) withhold testimony, or withhold a record, document, or other object, from an official proceeding; (B) alter, destroy, mutilate, or conceal an object with intent to impair the object’s integrity or availability for use in an official proceeding; (C) evade legal process summoning that person to appear as a witness, or to produce a record, document, or other object, in an official proceeding; or (D) be absent from an official proceeding to which such person has been summoned by legal process; or"

       Comey did make it a point he would reserve judgement and only present facts. He referred those questions to the special counsel. But he does lay out the case for it, it was linked earlier.

       That was just part of Comeys routine. If he could have been waving an American flag the whole time he would have. He never says more than he has to and chooses his words wisely. He is a very smart man and sees all the angles.

       comey said that it's up to the commission to determine if it was obstruction or not. He's not part of the investigation, so it's not his place to determine that any more.
      </p>
      <p>
       This testimony is going to set trump up for an impeachment hearing, guaranteed - because there is at least grounds to suspect obstruction.

       He doesn't need to literally be saying : "I'm obstructing justice right now by asking you to stop this investigation", it's pretty fucking implicit.

       One is saying he is trying to stop the investigation. The other is saying he doesn't trust the guy conducting the investigation - which
       <em>
        can
       </em>
       be perfectly acceptable, though not necessarily perfectly acceptable. So did he actually say he fired Comey to disrupt the investigation? Or did he say it was over the handling of the investigation?

       <p>
        Gaslighting is a form of manipulation that seeks to sow seeds of doubt in a targeted individual or members of a group, hoping to make targets question their own memory, perception, and sanity. Using persistent denial, misdirection, contradiction, and lying, it attempts to destabilize the target and delegitimize the target's belief.

       I'd appreciate you putting out this theory instead of linking to a fucking Wikipedia page that has no information or writing something like this:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Russian fingerprints... In other words Anti-Putin Russian(Ukrainian(CIA)) fingerprints
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       which is textbook gaslighting.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, let's read the article. Ctrl+F "father"
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Dmitri Alperovitch knows a thing or two about what the Russians call "active measures," in which propaganda is used to undermine a target country's political systems. He was born in 1980 in Moscow, in an era when people were afraid to discuss politics even inside their homes. His father, Michael, was a nuclear physicist who barely escaped being sent to Chernobyl as part of a rescue mission in 1986. Many of Michael's close friends and colleagues died of radiation poisoning within months of flying to the burning power plant. The takeaway for Dmitri was that "life is cheap in the Soviet Union."
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <h2>
      </h2>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Michael also taught Dmitri to code. Without a computer at home, Dmitri practiced by writing down algorithms on paper. In 1990, his father was sent to Maryland as part of a nuclear-safety training program for scientists. Per Soviet custom, Dmitri stayed in the USSR to ensure that his parents didn't defect. He lived with his grandparents, and when his parents returned, after a year, they brought him his first computer, an IBM PC.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <h2>
      </h2>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        In 1994, his father was granted a visa to Canada, and a year later the family moved to Chattanooga, where Michael took a job with the Tennessee Valley Authority. The work was not particularly challenging, so Michael began studying cryptography on the side. While Dmitri was still in high school, he and his father started an encryption-technology business. Dmitri says he loved the beauty of the math but also saw cryptography's fatal flaw: "If someone stole your keys to encrypt the data, it didn't matter how secure the algorithms were."
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <h2>
      </h2>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        <del>
         Alperovitch studied computer science at Georgia Tech and went on to work at an antispam software firm. There he met a striking dark-haired computer geek named Phyllis Schneck. As a teenager, Schneck once showed her father that she could hack into the company where he worked as an engineer. Appalled, Dr. Schneck made his daughter promise never to do something like that again.
        </del>
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Oops, different father.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hmm, nothing about CIA ties. Where are you getting that from?

       So you agree that you're basically spouting extremely biased news without good sources? And you're chalking it up as what? Not gaslighting?
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Russians did not hack the DNC system, a Russian named Dmitri Alperovitch is the hacker and he works for President Obama.

       Someone working for Obama hacked the DNC so that it could get leaked and then thrown up so that the Democrats would lose and Obama's legacy would get torn apart??

       Why would anti Putin Ukrainians do the hack, Hilary would be far tougher on Putin than Obama or trump ever will. They would probably have hacked the GOP and blamed the Russians as an anti Putin leader would be in charge and would actually do something about Putin.

       Ok now I think I get what you are saying, the way you wrote it is kind of confusing as I thought you were trying to say it was the Ukrainians who hacked the DNC with the CIA. As opposed to Seth leaking the data and a pro Ukrainian independence, and anti Putin man in charge of investigation of the hack made up the whole story to blame Russia so the DNC can use it against trump and later against Russia.

       Yep and Reddit is being used to force the same narratives down people's throats.
       <br/>
       No matter what you say, unless you fall in line with the narrative (Trumps bad, Working with Russians etc) anything you say will be downvoted and buried.
      </p>
      <p>
       Perfect system for showing people if you want to be popular, go with what they want you to say.

       Why is the narrative that Trump is bad wrong given his behavior, what he wants to do, and his actions.  You do realize it is possible to think he isn't a decent president without being a shill or what ever today word  is.

       The elites figured out where intelligent discussions were happening years ago. It's just that much more obvious now.

        /r/politics

       doesn't want to talk about (and this sub apparently as well because I don't see anything on it from a quick glance) is this:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        In his Thursday testimony before the Senate Intelligence Committee, former FBI director James B. Comey said that a controversial New York Times story in February about alleged contacts between Trump intimates and Russian officials was bogus.
       </p>
       <p>
        “The challenge, and I’m not picking on reporters, about writing stories about classified information is the people talking about it often don’t really know what’s going on and those of us who actually know what’s going on are not talking about it,” said Comey during questioning from Sen. James Risch (R-Idaho). “And we don’t call the press and say, ‘Hey, you got that thing wrong.’ ”

       Have you ever tried to be thankful to them, just as like an exercise in forgiveness? I thought it would be hard, but a lot of the skills that I now value most have come as a direct result of their meddling. It's made me into a meticulous researcher; an archiver; someone who speaks of what he knows; not to mention all the valuable information that is to be had through learning to detect their meddling.

       Apparently you dont take part in the intelligent aspect lmao conspircays are a very real thing, they happen literally all the time, its not just a government thing and its not just shit on national levels.  THEORIES IS THE WORD YOUR LOOKING TO MAKE FUN OF, which is still fucking baseless because gravity is just a theory so im not even really sure what your comment is trying to get across besides the fact you dont know the definition of words.

       That sub is one most censored place on the internet. If you don't agree with their narrative you are silenced.

       T_D is a fucking fan page. It doesn't pretend to be an open discussion about politics and then ban people who disagree with them. It is FOR Trump supporters to talk about Trump.

      <p>
       Just like if you go into a Hilary sub and start talking shit about Hilary they'll ban you.

       Politics is SUPPOSED to be a sub for open civil discussion about political matters, by their own admission. Yet they ban people who even try to have a discussion.

       It's a phrase. Everything can technically be compared. I'm pretty sure the original meant comparing apples to apples in term of quality or taste. Oranges aren't the same taste, color, texture. The basic things are different.

       That wasnt the claim of OP. I agree politics is 1-sided shit.Mostly cause of how reddit leans left. (and probably bots too)
      </p>
      <p>
       OP claimed it was one of the most censored places on the internet. That is a HUGE exaggeration. It wouldnt even be the case on reddit. There's so many subs that have nazi mods. Meaning OP is factually incorrect.
      </p>
      <p>
       And you are incorrect in saying T_D is for trump supporters about trump. The place is riddled with propaganda. And you cant propperly discuss trump cause anything that criticises him or his policies can get banhammered. Even he himself said it, as in he said it something couple months before and then does something else. A user mentions it and gets banned. They'll ban things against trump his policies even though most of the users were against his actions (remember the drugs thing). It's not a place to discuss trump. It's a place to get brainwashed.

       Reddit has always leaned left but r/politics was not heavily censored in the past. It is now though with downvote bots and timer restrictions for downvoted posters.

      <p>
       They don't outright delete to maintain the illusion of open discussion but the bots and timer restrictions achieve the same end in an undercover manner.

       Would disagree. I'm a great sample case of someone that historically was a frequent contributor at politics. For years that was one of my primarily subs to air out my thoughts on political events, disagree, debate, find which of my assumptions could be knocked down and rebuild my thoughts from stronger assumptions.
      </p>
      <p>
       During the 2016 election the sub completely changed. No longer could I air out thoughts and learn from others. Any time I voiced something disagreeable personal attacks followed. That's it. No counter argument. No elaboration. Just attacks or reposted news articles light on detail but heavy on opinion. Stopped learning anything from that venue, point taken and moving on.
      </p>
      <p>
       Over on T_D I can still disagree with people and have conversations where I'm learning. They've got giant road flares toward giant dumps of boring data so tedious to work through but where new knowledge comes from.
      </p>
      <p>
       Everyone seems to have forgotten that one can be critical of the Democrat leadership and angry with them for the direction they've taken the party, without necessarily being a Trump supporter or even a Republican. Much of the efforts on Reddit attack both types of individuals as if they're the same. As a Dem who feels the likes of Debbie Wasserman and Donna Brazile belong in a cell it's infuriating.

       And Reddit is mostly liberal, you can't just force the upvote totals to make it neutral for every political view. And on
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics
       </a>
       you can still find plenty of dissenting views throughout the comments, some will be downvoted sure, but they're there. Then take a look at a big T_D thread and see how many [deleted] there are

       Politics sub changed their filtdring rules so they censorship is more undercover-- they have downvote bots punishing comments against the narrative, and then any posters in the sub with a net negative downvote history are penalised with an 8 minute timer per post. This effectively chills conversation and forces opposed views outwards.

       Well even if they use bots and the timer it still isn't hard to find comments with opposing views m, not hard at all. No go to a T_D thread and if you're not going along with something Trump is doing 100% of the time they will absolutely ban you. That's actual censorship, they don't even let you have a chance

       Perhaps it would be fairer to say: reddit is overwhelmingly
       <em>
        socially
       </em>
       liberal. In very specific ways. In recent years, Republicans have pushed hard against those specific ways, making reddit more liberal practically out of necessity. However, in many ways, reddit could be considered massively conservative.
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically, the reddit "hivemind" isn't massively liberal so much as it is liberal in the ways that make one identify as liberal.

       Don't conflate what goes on there with legitimate or organic activity.  Downvoting would be fine, but groups like CTR and now ShareBlue spent large sums of money compromising subreddits/admins.  Mods were never meant to be thought police, yet now on Reddit they are.

       I highly doubt that, say, r/XCOM or r/ManyATrueNerd, or r/parahumans are targets of up and downvote manipulation. I'm not saying it doesn't exist, but I think it's dramatically overstated, and balanced out somewhat by attempted manipulation on the other side.
      </p>
      <p>
       I want to make clear, though, that when I say "balanced out", I mean in terms of how things would look if neither side was engaged in it. Not morally. I hate the idea of vote manipulation, even though I know technically it's just internet points that mean nothing.

       Media members have always used reddit to get their stories.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its very easy to spot them. I've seen Buzzfeed writers melt down over people dissing buzzfeed all the time. They have a script response about how Buzzzfeed is becoming a legitimate source they have to use. Its actually hilarious.

       It was pretty difficult back when r/all was r/pics gaza-aushwitz comparison photos, r/askreddit "girls of reddit...pls", and cats. Back then you could literally get a front page discussion going on just about anything that's posted here. Now it feels silly to even try because they have rules in place to delete pretty much anything they want. Those gaza threads were really wholesome. No amount of zionist propaganda could outweigh kids who were curious to hear something other than the government narrative.

       So she states that Comey pointed out that Sessiond was under Criminal investigation for the first time. What is wrong with pointing this fact out? Media members aren't allowed to go on social media now? I mean they do it on twitter all day, but it's wrong on Reddit?

       You're asking the wrong person, I didn't claim any of those things.  I was disproving the notion that there weren't MSM top comments, because it is an observable fact that there are.

       I am sure that were were high level comments from MSM members in that thread.  That's all.  I saw someone call bullshit on that and knew they were wrong, that's the only reason I'm in this thread.

       That brought me back, I had an English teacher in the 8th grade that wouldn't let us use certain words in essays. I don't remember anything other than they were pretty common and a pain in the ass to work around. I know he thought it would make us better writers but fuck, it still pisses me off. I'd usually just omit the word and take the C.

       Similarly, way back when in 9th grade I had an English teacher who really hated the word "that" in almost any of it's applications. He said it's a lazy word, it sounds stupid, and in most situations it can be replaced by something else.

       That's not the highest ranking comment. It's a comment with a lot of upvotes.  The post says the top comments are all main stream media.  It's a lie.

       The highest ranking comment has around 10,000 upvotes.

       It takes time to find your comment - you're lying too.  There's a comment by the washington post in there but it's one of many in the top.

       Lol. You think the US is so special that people care about it the world over?  I can guarantee you that nobody cares about his story. The UK just had an election yesterday and you think they care about this? All our countries have our own problems and USA is usually only in the news when it involves terrorism or something Donald Trump said or did.

       I saw multiple comments from users who were in other countries where every TV in their setting was tuned to the Comey hearing, including Singapore, India, and the U.K..
      </p>
      <p>
       My boyfriend was in a study abroad program in Tanzania last month, and said that many Tanzanians would mention their (generally negative) views of Trump and his antics during conversations he had with them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sure, not everyone cared around the world, but this was absolutely a major event worldwide in that many non-Americans do care quite a bit about what happens as a result of it.

         Be a great time to discuss options for Youtube as well--next year Youtube will be making a change and placing tons more ads on videos.  So far
         <a href="https://www.bitchute.com/">
          <strong>
           Bitchute.com
          </strong>
         </a>
         seems to be an option.  Problem is they are just starting out and only have approved a few submitters for content (including James Corbett).  No doubt the MSM infesting Youtube has a lot to do with Youtube changing their ad policies--we will all be regretting not planning ahead if we don't try to find another way to post videos.

       I lean slightly right of center, but on many issues I'm right there with the Bernie crowd.  I don't consider myself a member of any party, I examine the candidates for each vote I cast and try to pick the best one for the job.

       but people just want to shout you down unless you toe the party line.  Its been a BS sub for a long time now.  Two years ago it was literally 100% dominated by Bernie shit on the front page.  I remember getting downvoted for pointing that out, asking "Hey is this
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics
       </a>
       or
       <a href="/r/berniesanders">
        /r/berniesanders

       ?  These days I'd like to ask them, "Hey is this

       rule of thumb if one is admitting to being paid commentary then there are about 100 more that don't admit it. this is simply one of the few cases where it's actually beneficial to admit it...because the forum is so flagrantly brainwashed.

       OP seems mistaken about numbers of comments.
      </p>
      <p>
       Reddit is indeed a site for members of the MSM.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are bot accounts, there are shill accounts. That's besides the point.
      </p>
      <p>
       "MSM," main stream media, covers many groups. Including anyone in news, advertising, promotion of arts. Those are still broad categories themselves. The only thing someone needs to make a reddit account is an email address. The only thing someone needs for an email address, is a unique character set.
      </p>
      <p>
       Given this, there is an extremely high possibility that people working in the mentioned fields not only have reddit accounts for work, but also for personal use. There's an obvious inherent bias on any website because of this. There is a equally good chance that the reason reddit is one of the most popular websites — It's in the top 10 almost anywhere you look — is because the MSM uses it so often.
      </p>
      <p>
       Redit has probably always been a site for the MSM. As has pretty much the entire internet, for the majority of it's history at this point. The web is mostly porn, despite social stigma, porn is very MSM.
      </p>
      <p>
       Use at least the same discretion online as you would watching anything on traditional TV.

       Ah I thought you were still talking about collusion.

       So about obstruction, same argument. Care to show me the proof?
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        “I take the president at his word that I was fired because of the Russia investigation,” Mr Comey told the Senate Intelligence Committee in a public hearing. “Something about the way I was conducting it, the president felt, created pressure on him he wanted to relieve.”
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       That is pretty clear obstruction. Comey did say he wanted to stop short of making conclusions and will leave that for investigators. Since he is a private citizen now.

       I have looked, and all I have found is him admitting to "interpreting" what Trump said as orders.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I'm pretty sure the use of "I hope this will go away" precludes the notion of it being an order.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Make this go away." Would be clear cut, and the issue would be finished by now.

       Watch the exchange with cotton and comey. You can deny it now, but it'll come out eventually.

       If you dont like think progress, just search for the comey cotton part of the testimony and comeys answer on collusion. There are plenty of links to the video itself you can watch.

       comey said that it's up to the commission to determine if it was obstruction or not. He's not part of the investigation, so it's not his place to determine that any more.
      </p>
      <p>
       This testimony is going to set trump up for an impeachment hearing, guaranteed - because there is at least grounds to suspect obstruction.

       One is saying he is trying to stop the investigation. The other is saying he doesn't trust the guy conducting the investigation - which
       <em>
        can

       So she states that Comey pointed out that Sessiond was under Criminal investigation for the first time. What is wrong with pointing this fact out? Media members aren't allowed to go on social media now? I mean they do it on twitter all day, but it's wrong on Reddit?
