    <div class="md"><p>Ive said this once already in another thread but why is everyone ignoring that fact that Lynch said this AFTER the tarmac conversation with Bill Clinton?</p>

<p>BURR: Let me go back if I can very briefly to the decision to publicly go out with your results on the email. Was your decision influenced by the attorney general&#39;s tarmac meeting with the former president, Bill Clinton?</p>

<p>COMEY: Yes. In ultimately conclusive way that was the thing that capped it for me, that I had to do something separately to protect the credibility of the investigation, which meant both the FBI and the justice department.</p>

<p>BURR: Were there other things that contributed to that, that you can describe in an open session?</p>

<p>COMEY: There were other things that contributed to that. One significant item I can&#39;t but know the committee&#39;s been briefed on, there&#39;s been some public accounts of it which are nonsense but I understand the committee has been briefed on the classified facts. Probably the only other consideration that I guess I can talk about in open setting is that at one point the attorney general had directed me not to call it an investigation, but instead to call it a matter, which confused me and concerned me, but that was one of the bricks in the load that led me to conclude I have to step away from the department if we&#39;re to close this case credibly.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is the fifth or sixth post here claiming Lynch asking Comey to refer to the email investigation as a &quot;matter&quot; is the major takeaway from the testimony. If this is such an outrageous obstruction of justice and Lynch should be jailed over it, then what is your standard for Trump <em>actually firing Comey</em> over the Russian investigation (which, by the way predates the election, but was never the subject of FBI press releases during the campaign, unlike the Clinton investigation).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Everything you just typed out is flatly wrong by the sworn testimony we just watched today.

    <div class="md"><p>The dossier was not even discussed because it was &quot;classified&quot;, if you can show me one article that shows verification of any aspect of it I would gladly read it. The dossier which is all about Trump and his alleged Russian ties if verified would obviously lead to a counter intelligence investigation into Trump which Comey stated does not exist. So I wonder what aspects of the dossier are correct if none of them can open an investigation into Trump?</p>

<p>The Flynn investigation into his phone calls with Russia is over they found no wrong doing. Now what you probably are referring to is a couple weeks ago when Flynn pled the 5th. This is to an investigation into the broad &quot;Russian ties&quot; of the Trump campaign. Flynn being in the Trump campaign was to come forward with his own information on his connections with Russia which he pled the 5th. What was discussed today in the hearing with Comey about Trump asking him to &quot;let it go&quot; was a discussion about Flynn&#39;s calls which again showed no wrong doing. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I do think Lynch was certainly playing politics and was wrong.  I see your point there.  Her statement was more direct.  </p>

<p>Trump however - people forget.   Trump was not under criminal investigation.  To say I hope you can let this go - is very broad.  I believe Trump was hinting more to Comey that he should leak to the press that he is not under investigation.  I say that because Comey said Trump was wanting to get past this storm.  When you are focused on conveying 1 message while talking about 2 things - the listeners interpret things completely different.   But this isn&#39;t social justice - it was merely miscommunication and misunderstanding. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t recall if this was brought up at all during the course of that day according to Comey. And it would be important for what you say if Comey said that it was mentioned before or after that date because it WAS mentioned I will agree with you on that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was multi-tasking at this time but recall someone asking Comey why did he feel Trump was actively trying to communicate and meet with him.  Comey speculated that there was a lot going on that would prevent him from progressing his agenda.  Comey went on to explain that Trump said he hoped this whole Russian, Fynn issue would go away.  Then the senator I believe asked if Trump knew at that point he wasn&#39;t under investigation - and he said yes.</p>

<p>When you consider Comey&#39;s speculation with those comments  I get the feeling Trump was hinting to Comey.  </p>
