        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>This is really the most bizarre story I have read in a while. A government contractor gets a hold of a top secret document. A document that says nothing really. She then prints out the document and sends it to a journalist who works at the intercept. She is arrested within 24 hours.</p>

<p>Now we are seeing that she wanted to burn down the White House.</p>

<p><a href="http://abcnews.go.com/US/nsa-contractor-reality-winner-wanted-burn-white-house/story?id=47912175">http://abcnews.go.com/US/nsa-contractor-reality-winner-wanted-burn-white-house/story?id=47912175</a></p>

<p>She had hand written notes where she wanted to join the Taliban.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/foxandfriends/status/873130743165206528">https://twitter.com/foxandfriends/status/873130743165206528</a></p>

<p>In her own twitter called Trump an &quot;orange fascist&quot;. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.cnn.com/2017/06/06/politics/reality-winner-twitter-account/index.html">http://www.cnn.com/2017/06/06/politics/reality-winner-twitter-account/index.html</a></p>

<p>Then in court yesterday she pled &quot;not guilty&quot;.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.cnn.com/2017/06/08/us/reality-winner-hearing/index.html">http://www.cnn.com/2017/06/08/us/reality-winner-hearing/index.html</a></p>

<p>Ok so this has to either be a psy-op or Reality Winner is probably the worst &quot;leaker&quot; ever and also a little crazy.</p>

<p>The psy-op aspect would be by the Trump admin or some other IC to discredit leakers and make them seem as though they are deranged people who do no good for the country. </p>

<p>The other aspect is that she was pushed into this Trump vs. the left soap opera where people are becoming deranged and are willing to go to great lengths to prove that Trump works for Russia or he is &quot;literally Hitler&quot;. Also why would she plead &quot;not guilty&quot; if she wanted to be a whistle blower?</p>

<p>I really don&#39;t know what to make of it its all just so bizarre it really is. What are everyones thoughts on this?</p>

She obviously knows that she will be protected for some reason, and is already taking measures to cultivate an already thought-out image to the American public.

<blockquote>
<p>A document that says nothing really. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>That document says a whole lot. Doesn&#39;t prove, of course. But it opens the door to voter reg fuckery that quite clearly the NSA did not want to release, probably because they don&#39;t know if it worked or not or to what extent. It makes them look shitty and suggests a path to messing with the voting system through private sector infiltration. None of the stuff Obama&#39;s IC put in that admittedly weak assessment document from December portrayed the US as potentially incompetent and/or <em>truly</em> vulnerable in a compromising the actual vote sense, it just focused on propaganda and &quot;influence.&quot; </p>

<p>CNN&#39;s segment on this Winner stuff from today, which you listed in the exact order in which it was covered in the segment, only references the NSA and the &quot;stolen&quot; doc, they&#39;ve really shied away from considering the implications of what the doc suggests as possible, or what we are vulnerable to having happen. </p>

<p>Intense focus on the leaker, total brushing off of the leak itself. NSA is leaning on CNN here, and I&#39;m guessing on other outlets. Neither Russia-related testimony this week featured one mention of the NSA report (I&#39;m pretty sure). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well I can agree with you on this. Although in the document they don&#39;t say if anything Russia did was successful. Also I don&#39;t see the point of messing with EVID. Are they planning to send droves of people out to vote at multiple voting places with different IDs that are able to be verified through EVID software as to not raise suspicion? </p>

<p>So it really is a report that says they tried to do something but the success of what they tried is inconclusive. At the end with the with the American Samoa absentee ballots they were unsuccessful. Also, American Samoa what a weird area to conduct a cyber attempt on.</p>

<p>Here is the original intercept article if anyone wants to read it. </p>

<p>clearly the NSA did not want to release, probably because they don&#39;t know if it worked or not or to what extent. It makes them look shitty and suggests a path to messing with the voting system through private sector infiltration.</p>

<p>Partly, I suspect, but the way it unequivocally fingers the GRU (possibly even naming specific entities in the redacted sections) suggests they&#39;ve got some sort of source/line on them they don&#39;t want to burn by everybody knowing they have it.</p>

<p>Fuck knows what it is (and the proof is referenced in other unknown documents) - have they captured the GRU&#39;s systems or are intercepting their comms? Do they have an informant within the highest levels of Russian intelligence/military/political elite?</p>

Maybe in a situation where you are planning to plea out a case it could damage your relationship, I dunno IANAL, I just have been arrested many many times. But even then, the arraignment comes so fast, there is no time to consider what you are doing, the easiest thing to come back from is a not guilty plea. You can always enter a different plea later, but it is harder to say &quot;I thought I was guilty before, but now I&#39;m totally innocent&quot; than &quot;I didn&#39;t understand the case before, I guess I am guilty&quot;.

At the end of the day, neither side wants a jury verdict unless you&#39;re actually innocent. It&#39;s expensive, requires lots of time of homework, you gotta get all your witnesses together to show up, etc etc. Like <a href="/u/seinfeldologist">/u/seinfeldologist</a> said - it&#39;s standard procedure. In one of my cases I was caught red handed injecting heroin into my vein. There was no denying it, I had more heroin on me and needles, the whole 9 yards. Doesn&#39;t matter, plead not guilty first.

<p>I think it&#39;s the latter. she calls herself Reality Winner, so we know she&#39;s a bit kooky to begin with. I think she&#39;s probably an originally-normal person who went down the internet rabbit hole (maybe even LARPed on a forum with other like-minded people) and fancied herself a freedom-fighter like Snowden or something. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Online there&#39;s a (claimed?!) interview with her step-father with the following:</p>

<p>&#39;&#39;Mr Davis said that Reality&#39;s father had the honor of naming his second daughter.</p>

<p>&#39;He always wanted to have a &#39;Real Winner&#39; so he named her Reality Leigh Winner. It&#39;s just a beautiful name. The plan was to call her Leigh because Reality is kind of a strange name but everyone who knew her just loved the name Reality and it stuck with her. I forget sometimes that she has ever been called Leigh – she&#39;s always been Reality.&#39;&#39;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can&#39;t find anything indicating she changed her name either, but for some reason people keep repeating it. I agree it&#39;s unbelievable someone would name their baby daughter such a thing-- I saw her parents being interviewed by Andersoon Cooper a few days ago and they didn&#39;t seem eccentric or anything. Seemed like your average middle class middle aged white people, conservative in dress and manner. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What she leaked wasn&#39;t even worth much. The only people who got any value out of this leak were political operatives. I don&#39;t know how she came to be in the position she&#39;s in, but she wasn&#39;t the mastermind of this. If she isn&#39;t &quot;in on it,&quot; then I assume they set her up in some way, such as providing the document to her and emphasizing how important it was, and priming her to steal it. Nothing else about her seems all that dumb, and she seemed somewhat libertarian-leaning, so I can&#39;t see what she thought was worth losing years of her life over. Big deal, the Russians tried to do some hacking. So what else is new?</p>

<p>Reality Winner: legit or psy op? It&#39;s interesting because only a week beforehand George Webb had been taking about how when you want to run an op and tip someone off that someone is in on it, you&#39;d have a name like Winstead, Wingate, etc., as a bit of an inside joke as well.</p>
