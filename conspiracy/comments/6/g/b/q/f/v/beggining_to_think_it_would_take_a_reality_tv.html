But really,  I have never seen the DC and NY criminal bureaucrats and politicians this exposed,  and its no secret how bad they were,  but now,  its a daily outing of scum like Comey,  Lynch,  Hillary,  even Obama.   Wow!</p>

<p>No,  I am not starting to like Trump,  but if Julian helped Trump win,  I am starting to see the wisdom in it compared to if we had Hillary in there.    Its a deep state frenzy now.   Obama was so comfortable for the old status quo,  compared to this.  Amazing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>oh,  I remember now.  trump&#39;s history is sprinkled  with tons of stuff like this.   Can you believe people were rationalizing supporting him and overlooking all this crap?    But here we are,   and it is Trump who eventually graduated into reality tv,   the modern american gladiator show,  a public spectacle that celebrates degradation.    Trump also seemed to thrive on Howard Stern.   Its that bad.    But that is what it takes to match how bad the political arena has become.   Only the political arena has been hiding behind a narrative that many americans were all to happy to believe,  a pile of suggestions and lies that is rapidly falling apart,  to where our military recruits now know what they are signing up for,  mercenary servitude to wall street,  and when things go bad for them they commit suicide.   wow.</p>

<p>trump sits on top of this heap,  but the pile is made of worms that make him largely impotent.   The worms are stinging each other to death,  and so far trump survives better than most would!   his whole life seems to have been preparation for attack and evasion,  grandstanding and siphoning off money for his group of mafia types that are only a smaller version of the games played by wall street the republican party and the democratic party,   but its evolved with trump,   he is better designed than they are to thrive on being hated on the margins.    He doesn&#39;t need any respect or decorum or protocols.    So he&#39;s a guerilla politician while the rest of them are playing an older party game.</p>

<p>And by the way,  that meeting,  where Putin briefly sat at a table with no translator is very well documented.    And by the way further,  I would expect any leader to also have been to dinners in China,  Argentina,  where ever.   You know Bush Jr used to openly share his love of Putin,  right?   Or that Clinton helped Putin come to power right?    Who did you vote for?</p>

<p>You know American presidents,  presidents everywhere have a lot of functions where foreigners are expected to attend.    </p>

<p>As far as Jill being paid to run,  I think the funding would have included an arrangement to give her a little media time.    I mean,  she got 100 times more media after the election than before,  as well as more funding after the election.    </p>

<p>Is corporate welfare liberal or right wing?    Is bailing out wall street liberal or right wing?    Who hasn&#39;t made government both bigger and crumbier lately?</p>

<p>Hillary knows that the Russia scare America is in the grip of is fabricated,  based on Putin&#39;s obstruction of our plans for Ukraine and Syria etc.</p>

<p>&quot;My agenda&quot; I am assuming is a few progressive bread crumbs that were ever so slightly more likely under the corrupt Democrats than under the corrupt Republicans.    I have never voted Republican in my life and remain a registered Democrat at this moment,  teetering very very close to going independent,  except then I throw away my vote in the primaries,   and I did also vote Bernie in the primaries,  and was absolutely shocked and appalled that he backed Hillary rather than fight the DNC tooth and nail and even join Jill when Jill offered him her place as head of the Greens.   But Bernie is an old time politician,  from another generation,  and I can slightly understand his caving,  maybe I understand,  but maybe he is just corrupt or was threatened in a very personal way.   At this point,  I am afraid the progressive side of the Democrats cannot recover.</p>

<p>But really it is the international genocide on Hitler proportions that is the last straw for me.   There is no plan for single payer health care,  there is no plan to end the war on drugs,  there is no likely change in policy that will end the prison industrial complex,  so what  &quot;my agenda&quot; is left,  more stuff for minorities or identity groups which have gotten stupid anyway?    No,  the elephant in the room is a million dead since 9/11,  much of it on Obama/Hillary/Kerry &#39;s watch.   No.   No.   No.    Its too brain dead for me to be associated with.    30 suicides a day of returning vets.   This is so over the top that there is no agenda to have.    There is only a horrified scream of when the chickens finally come home to roost and expose us all as Good Germans.</p>
