       Then why don't they win already? They won't win because they can't. Same reason why shills try as hard as they can and work long useless hours but still fail badly and never win.

       The shills are frightened and scared that's why they're so defensive, have little fits of anger all the time and call people names. So it's obvious they're losing.

       The shills know the situation. They know they've been losing, they know there's no hope left. You can feel their stress and frustration come out of their comments.

       This is why the system of partisan politics is successful. If you try to discipline a leader of one side, the masses of that party will divert the argument. They will fight for people that view them as game. If everyone is doing something shady, then how can you possibly discipline them all?
