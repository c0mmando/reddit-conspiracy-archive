       I found an interesting video on cnn.com, that was published in 2016.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2016/01/06/gun-violence-survivors-jillian-soto-origwx-jm-ar.cnn">
        http://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2016/01/06/gun-violence-survivors-jillian-soto-origwx-jm-ar.cnn
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       In the video, the sister of slain teacher Victoria Soto is speaking about how gun violence took the life of her sister. The video begins "my life was affected by gun violence on December 12th, 2014"
      </p>
      <p>
       The shooting, however, took place on December 14th, 2012.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whats going on here, a simple mis speak? If so, why has cnn failed to acknowledge the mistake for a year and a half now? Seemed strange to me when i watched it.

       If you hinge a theory about something on one person speaking a wrong date you have nothing much to go on.
      </p>
      <p>
       Example: On 9/11 we had a lot of people saying a lot of things which some ran off with and used as the basis of their conspiracy - all the while ignoring the hundreds or more of others who said something different. Why believe the one over the many?
      </p>

       You need to look at things in a broader way if your goal is the truth.

       No, it isn't.
      </p>
      <p>
       On 9/11 you can find people who claim they saw no planes. That means nothing really. You can find people who might claim the JFK assassination was on a different day - people are not reliable on these things individually. This should be obvious.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, given what the op said, why would anyone at all think that because one person said something vs all the others who did that it means anything at all?
      </p>
      <p>
       A person, under stress, in front of cameras, lack of sleep possibly, etc shouldn't be basis on which you address a conspiracy.

       I think people died on that day... if not then the government really went above and beyond to falsify 1000s of pages of documents and photos just to help perpetuate the hoax that they don't bother releasing in most other major tragedies.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know that's not a popular opinion for this sub, and there were a few anomalies in early reporting but after spending a few hours pawing thru
       <a href="http://cspsandyhookreport.ct.gov/">
        http://cspsandyhookreport.ct.gov/

       I see that the amount of documentation is a staggering amount to bother faking when no one will real read thru it.

       I got thru maybe 2000 pages... Police is similar to FBI and I'm fluent in FBI so it is quick reading... There had to be like 75 pages about "The Hum" in there... certainly more than one letter.

       There was a fucknut around here a couple weeks ago with a wild hair across his ass about the government report... you should find that guy and hang out with him. You guys could shoot the shit till the cows come home.

      <p>
       Shit...  the part about "The Hum" was the most interesting part of those files... everything else looks to be pretty much by the book. I bring it up cause I seen a lot of people go all tinfoil on Sandy Hook here... but never did anyone bring up "The Hum" I figgered someone would get a kick out of it.

       Well you seem to be a buff on this particular conspiracy, so how about you just gimme the page number or a screen shot of something to get me going in the right direction. Yer already like 4000 pages ahead of me so it would be helpful... cause if ya can't provide documentation it comes across like yer just making shit up.

       Maybe... In the end I don't really care that much... some loony shot up some kids. It happens all the time all around the world. Maybe it will happen in your town and then everyone will say you are lying when you think it is real.

       Not one piece of which are you able to independently verify. No crime scene photos of bodies…of the shooter…no autopsy photos of the shooter.

       In case the "7 adults" didn't clue you in not all the victims were children. You behave as if crime scene photos are unheard of. Do a search right now for "crime scene photos" and see what comes up.
      </p>
      <p>
       If bodies bother you how about some pics of the scene after the bodies had been removed? How about any security cam footage from the dozens of cams in Newtown the day of the shooting showing the shooter or his car? How about any fn thing that might provide proof any of this happened?

       The fact that a tragedy is exploited for political gain does not mean it did not happen. Just the logistics of something that big, it would literally make no sense, just wait for a real one and exploit it, not like they don't happen all the time.

       Shit...  the part about "The Hum" was the most interesting part of those files... everything else looks to be pretty much by the book.
