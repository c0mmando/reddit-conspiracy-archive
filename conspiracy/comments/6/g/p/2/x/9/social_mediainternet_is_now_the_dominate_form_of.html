<p>I think I&#39;m preaching to the choir here, but I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve noticed all the censorship occurring on the web. Youtube, Facebook, Google, so on and so fourth. Not that this is a surprise, but it&#39;s at the point where it feels these corporations aren&#39;t even trying to pretend to be fair anymore. </p>

<p>PG was a real eye opener for me. I witnessed just how biased MSM and how out of control social networks actually are. Why is this? </p>

<p>62% of US Adults now get their news from social media. </p>

<p>I predict we&#39;re going to see much more censorship activity out of the largest information giants on the web. It&#39;s not just the blatant deleting of videos either, but it&#39;s the limitation of discovery, the in-ability for creators to monetize, and the constant opposition these creators must have when it comes to shills. </p>

<p>After PizzaGate I quit my job and began working of a startup with several other &quot;woke individuals&quot;. We&#39;re building a combination of Youtube and Medium with content discovery benefits similar to a platform such as Reddit. </p>

<p>I&#39;d love to get some input from the users here at <a href="/r/Conspiracy">/r/Conspiracy</a> in regards to what you want to see in the future of the truth movements. What mechanisms, features, etc can help relay the truth without playing into the hands of shill and controlled opposition? What type of platforms would you be interested in? How could YouTube be improved + Medium? </p>

<p>Would love any feed-back and if you have any questions about what we&#39;re putting together feel free to reach out! In addition if you are a truther and want to fix the media censorship tsunami we&#39;re experiencing today we&#39;re looking for an additional developer! </p>

<p>Ok. Truth. That means vetting sources for one and not just believing something someone says because you want to (that is religion).</p>

<p>Context with truth. Example: In the Seth Rich case you will see people claiming the hospital won&#39;t release information, the coroner won&#39;t release the report, and the police don&#39;t care. This is supposed to push a conspiracy narrative. But with a few emails/calls you can learn this:</p>

<p>The Hospital acts the same way with all cases, the coroner won&#39;t release a report without family consent, and the cops have over a hundred other older cases (not to mention newer) and only a handful of detectives to work them all. </p>

<p>One way to fix issues we see with the media is to broaden our view of media (as I have mentioned before here I track on twitter 600 tv stations in the US, 90 papers world wide, and 100 in the UK and all members of congress). I see more news in 20 minutes then you will see on TV all week. </p>

<p>My point is that there is a lot of news out there never focused on by the larger public (only so many hours in a day for people to check news).</p>

<p>So on that point, include more and more sources (can show you how I built the above) so your worldview is larger.</p>

<p>Lastly, on the msm, if you are going to challenge their view of something (and we all should) work on making a strong case backed up with timelines and reliable sources - including yourself and others who know how to investigate and can call/email/interview/etc others to get hard data.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Very great journalistic tips! </p>

<p>We&#39;re not building a label, rather a platform for posting Videos + Articles like (Youtube/Medium), however we&#39;re installing a very discovery friendly platform for finding content. So in a way it&#39;s similar to the problem of being bombarded with too much without proper filters. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>In that case, some suggestions on that:</p>

<p>Generate a list of sources from the videos/etc. Not just subject matter but an easy to index/search method of finding stuff. You could consider, if so inclined, to get some software that turns text to speech and indexing that in a database (lot of experience in coding and database architecting - and being able to find videos that mention something but isn&#39;t in the tags would be helpful to many).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The &quot;truth movement&quot; has demonstrated to us that our leaders are corrupt, lie,  are generally managing society for their own self-interest, and are trying to keep everyone else in the dark.  So I reckon the natural consequence of this behaviour, which doesn&#39;t seem like it&#39;s gonna change any time soon, is to coalesce like-minded with the goal of providing the means of life (food, shelter, etc) to everyone.  This would seem to be the intermediate goal to work towards in order to create an environment that was free of predation/distraction so that people could then learn what the real truth was, and likely enjoy this simulation until they wanted to leave it.   I don&#39;t know if videos and internet content are going to do that, although they&#39;re nice things to have.  Real actual change is needed with lasting checks against continued abuse.  This means designing our social systems correctly (ideally with a narrative, append-only design, similar to a book that can be read by everyone in society).  I have a whole bunch of ideas on how we should be building our social systems so that they&#39;re built well - what we currently have doesn&#39;t cut it and the politicians et. al don&#39;t know what the fuck they are doing.  Anyway, the first step is in shrugging off the abusers and that&#39;s control of food and shelter.  So efforts should be put forth in that area as a priority, imo.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>My main question is how do you plan on monetizing this?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>it has been my observation that any website that tries to monetize its content will eventually destroy itself. </p>

<p>the reason is the signal-to-noise ratio. most sites start out with very high signal and very low noise. there are no blinking ads, no annoying pop-ups, no auto-play videos, no sidebar packed with eye-candy, no &quot;sponsored&quot; content in your feed</p>

<p>but eventually, as website try to monetize, the web-page (or what i call vertical real estate) begins to have more clutter and less content. just look at how far downhill Facebook has gone since they tried to emulate MySpace </p>

<p>eventually, the website reaches a tipping point where they start to alienate their use-base, and the user-base begins to migrate elsewhere. the website, desperate to keep making the same revenue on the users who are left, puts even more ads up, which exacerbates their user migration problem. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The answer is political and economic. We need to collectively own this entity called the printing press. Something like a steemit or ethereum based publishing agency will be the way forward. In the meantime, we have to support independent journalists and publications.<br/>
Another side to the whole thing is the growing illiteracy of the population. As acoustic and video culture increasingly dominates our attention, how can we ensure people grow up with the ability to read, and not just read but criticize? And to write it out for themselves? A strong public education system is required, in my opinion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah. Definitely a concerted effort going on to take control of social media. More and more legitimate sources for discussion are being targeted. Particularly ones that don&#39;t buy the narratives. </p>

<p>I recall &#39;leaked&#39; docs illustrating how some PTB plan to destroy the remaining &#39;truth channels:&#39; but it was probably a LARP.</p>

<p>Regardless I do feel forums that advocate uncensored open discussion are under attack. We are rapidly coming to a time when censorship online will be the norm and I believe social media is a the biggest player here. Having your irl identity fused to your online presence is the worst thing to happen to the internet and they&#39;ve done it so well you have little choice but to subscribe. </p>

<p>Places like here allow open discussion on either end of the spectrum with only a strong preference for truth and that&#39;s why it&#39;s dangerous. 4chan&#39;s /pol/ is in the same boat and though I&#39;m sure we draw water from the same well they are usually the ones to break the stories nowadays. I believe the Donald has already been infiltrated; and unfortunately it&#39;s not much of a board for discussion outside of trump.</p>

<p>These are the last few bastions of free speech. It won&#39;t be long before you need a proxy of Tor to discuss unpopular opinions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know someone who worked for a start-up that was similar to you-tube, but with the ability to buy content instead of only free content. This was when youtube was a fledgling start up, itself, so may e things have changed. This start up was slapped with a bazillion lawsuits from movie studios, cable companies, anyone and everyone whose income may have been affected by a site such as this taking off. Also, with IP infringement lawsuits, many of them not legit claims, just leeches looking for someone to suck blood from. In the end, they had to shut down due to the lawsuits. Youtube only made it because Google has deep pockets to fight these suits. Good luck. With all my heart i hope you can make it work. </p>
