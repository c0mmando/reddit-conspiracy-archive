       Really makes you wonder if all this alarmism over man made global warming is just a plot to control energy.

       I would love to see the data and algorithms they used to calculate that. I would even love to run whatever computer models they have and see for myself.

       There is archaeological evidence homo erectus started cooking food 500,000 thousand years ago, many ice ages have come and gone since and I doubt our ancestors had anything to do with causing or stopping them.

       Exactly, even more reason to not add in to a natural occurring process that has happened before and will happen again. We should be trying to harness thermonuclear energy from them and trying to slow down the cycles / cleaning the air coming out.

       If you are near a volcano I recommend you hide run and hide if it starts to erupt.

       But not accurate with the rates of change they claim the upward trend will actually move. They get the Upward part correct, and that is it.

       I'm not a denier, I just don't think being an alarmist about it is the right approach. I think pollution is a bigger issue to our environment than CO2 emissions that come from man made sources.  The people of detroit don't give a damn about Co2, they are immediately concerned about the fact the water that comes from their kitchen sink is polluted.

       Just look at r/climatescience
      </p>
      <p>
       Despite most people on the subreddit believing climate change is caused by CO2 emissions, the science behind it seems almost nonexistent.
      </p>
      <p>
       They admit that the relation CO2 equals more heat is not accurate and that you have to factor in solar intensity as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       They are correct to argue that the rise in CO2 is anomalous if you look over the course of thousands of years, but if you look at the scale of millions of years you see that CO2 was much higher in the past and even during periods when the earth was cooler.
      </p>
      <p>
       But on the grand scheme of things we are at one of the lowest temperatures in earths history which tends to fluctuate within 22 degrees celsius. It's actually natural that the earth should be heating up again.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would link some graphs but you should just go to the sub yourself and see what their explanations are.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't want to belittle the science on it, because it is in fact very complicated. But that's the point and why I don't believe there is a consensus of scientists on the topic. If they actually know that global warming is caused by CO2 emissions "now" even when there are instances in the past where the relation is nonexistent, then these same scientists should have no problem predicting the stock market.

       The major problem here is the ~97% of scientists number that is constantly floating about, without the people touting those numbers actually presenting evidence for why those ~97% agree.
      </p>
      <p>
       On the other side of the argument, we have people who don't understand the difference between burning sequestered sources of CO2 vs. natural CO2 emissions.  They also don't seem to understand that we can directly measure the amount of CO2 we are putting into the atmosphere because it is actually different from natural sources.

       I have a hard time believing that so many people are lying about the data, to what end? From my limited understanding this is about rate of warming. Natural cycles happen but over the last 100 years the correlation between our industrial age and pattern of warming are in sync.
      </p>
      <p>
       We seem to think we have no impact on the planet and i know that is wrong. It is also dangerous. More to the point why would so many people lie?! All on the payroll and all incorrect with the science?  That doesn't make any sense at all. The last few years have been the warmest on record and the trend has been growing for decades. Larsen C, methane release and coral bleaching are all indicative of a warming climate.
      </p>
      <p>
       We live on this planet but we treat it like we have another one to go to. We don't.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think the exact science is worked out but to disregard the data and opinions of so many scientists is absurd.

       Don't you think it's strange that the Rockefellers as founders and major shareholders of Exxon were funding, pushing and promoting climate change for all of those decades?

       Don't you find it strange that
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q5ZgR_-SO8U&amp;amp;">
        Maurice Strong, a Rockefeller operative
       </a>

       <li>
        human-induced climate change
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       If you were a scientist who can't find "human-induced climate change", you would not be adhering to your job.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ever find it funny how the Rockefellers could take over the American Medical Association and determine who can be a doctor, and yet a small under-funded niche field of climate science was free from their influence?

       $cience is a religion these days, mate. They are literally calling for people who deny man made climate change to be arrested. Which would probably include me, because I believe in Climate Cycles and believe we are going through a big one right now going forward, but do not believe man has an effect on it (short of nuclear winter). Sounds like the Catholic church and the inquisitions, to me....

       The debate is never over as i said but i cannot understand why so many scientists would put there names on the line if all of this was nonsense.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do keep an open mind and understand the nature if conspiracy as much as the next person. I have a hard time believing that so many people would lie to us and put their careers on the line. If this was all bullshit the science would prove it and they would be out of work, so far that hasn't happened.

       The suggestion that they are all taking payments to go with the globalist narrative doesn't wash. I've read, watched and listened to a lot of these guys and they are either Oscar grade actors or they don't understand their professions.

       I get the argument from both sides, i honestly do. I just believe we shouldn't take Earth for granted, or dismiss that we are having an impact upon it.

       97% of all climate scientists most likely entered the field as true believers. Scientific fields that are entirely built around confirmation bias, aren't tremendously credible. I say this as someone who actually believes that climate change is real and a considerable amount of it is likely caused by humans.

       But this adds up right:
      </p>
      <p>
       India has the world's largest supply of thorium. India had a working thorium design. India decided not to go ahead with their design because:
      </p>

       <a href="http://www.world-nuclear.org/information-library/country-profiles/countries-g-n/india.aspx">
        http://www.world-nuclear.org/information-library/country-profiles/countries-g-n/india.aspx
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       In October 2013 BARC said that premature deployment of thorium would lead to sub-optimal use of indigenous energy resources
      </p>
      <p>
       But meanwhile, India states they need to go to the moon for energy resources:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.livemint.com/Science/W5WjJCdqqxXYpHvrB2TTHP/Isro-plans-to-mine-energy-from-Moon-by-2030-to-help-meet-Ind.html">

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       That makes sense. They are worried about "sub-optimal use of indigenous energy resources" so they can't deploy thorium energy, but they are going to the moon for energy resources?

       As a whole, not as much as nature could do with, say, a volcano erupting, or the caldera under Yellowstone popping off. I really think people don't realize if the earth really wanted to, it could restart at any point. CO2 isn't as nasty as methane, but we can use and harvest both. Our capabilities are boundless when it comes to clean living, but other interests would rather suck the Earth dry and move on.

       All weather could be man made at this point. I keep reading about HAARP and the Doppler radars having a hand in changing and controlling weather. NASA has a cloud seeding machine as well. Plus chemtrails. I'm hard pressed to believe it could be otherwise.
