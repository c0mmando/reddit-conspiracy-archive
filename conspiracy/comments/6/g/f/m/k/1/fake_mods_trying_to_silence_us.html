       Can the mods please create a sticky or a sidebar note teaching users how to identify real mod communications.  For a few weeks now some very messed up people have been spoofing the names of mods to scare people away with fake mod warnings.  Not everyone can tell the difference. however, it's very obvious once shown.

       I wish permanent banning was a real thing just for these douches.

       The obvious first move is to check it's not a subtle clone of a username but thanks for bringing this to people's attention. This sub has come under constant attack recently due to it's refusal to 'pick a side' in the self-defeating divide and conquer Govt. sponsored psy-op that is politics. They do not represent any of your better interests whatever colour sash they wear while selling your futures to corporate interests.

       Actually, you are very clearly picking a side with this comment. You are attempting to decide for your users that the current administration is secretly on the same team as the previous administration. It's fine if you believe that, as long as you recognize that it is your own personal bias. We still don't know for sure what is going on with Donald Trump. If he is actually working against the criminal government, then it would make sense for shilling organizations to push your viewpoint on the internet to keep a lid on his public support.

       I'm actually pretty concerned about how nonchalantly you skipped over that blind spot as if it wasn't there.

       is inherently anti government. As the head of the executive branch that makes it lean anti trump, theoretically at least. Lots of people cheerlead government here but conspiracy is not the place to do that.

       is not anti-government by default, it is anti-corruption and anti-authoritarian. Many of us here would love to support our country if it wasn't compromised by Deep State criminals. That's why there is so much grass roots support for Donald Trump on forums that have been traditionally anti-establishment. Many of us see Donald Trump as a possible chance to break the criminal influence in government. It's fine if you disagree, but that is your own personal bias, not a fact. This is a perfectly reasonable forum for discussion of that possibility.

I wont lay down like a dog and accept that we can't do anything about it just because it seems impossible.

       Right, I got that you are an anarchist like 3 comments ago. It's cool, I have nothing against you. I would just prefer a properly functioning government that is not compromised to protect criminals. If we can't fix it this time around, I'll come back and see what suggestions you might have to offer.

       "A properly working government" is an oxymoron. Proper govenment is decentralized and hence pluralistic. When you centralize the powers of government, you make a monopoly of regulation which encourages corruption.
      </p>
      <p>
       This time around? How many centuries will it take of police states and kleptocrats before you understand these simple facts?

       I'm just willing to give traditional law enforcement one last chance. If Donald Trump and Jeff Sessions fail at their attempt to take out the global international Mafia, then you may find yourself with a new anarchist brother. But for now, I want to maintain some hope that the traditional perspective on representative government is just working out the last kinks before it finds a balance between protecting individual rights and fighting criminal influence in government.

       You've got more patience than me. Our system of government date two millenia. The complaints made today echo those made by Jesus. How many last chances have we given them?

      <p>
       Individual rights cannot be protected by a government just as criminal influence in government cannot be fought with government.

       I'm glad you'll see things this way soon, because even on the odd chance that Trump has the goal of draining the swamp, it's a sysiphean task. Every step of the way, tens of thousands of petty corrupt bureaucrats will oppose him.

       Our best chance is local solidarity and media presence ridiculing and outing our local corruption and waking the masses up to the fact that distant kings only have as much power over us as we allow them to.

       Being pro Donald trump in this sub is being a pro government cheerleader on the conspiracy subreddit. That is absolutely a fact and not an opinion.

       What the hell is your point? If there is a chance of restoring justice and restoring the nation to something we can be proud of, then hell yes I'm a cheerleader for that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your
       <em>
        opinion
       </em>
       is that this is no place for people who are optimistic about Donald Trump. I say who the hell are you and why should I care what you think?
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's an analogy: suppose Ron Paul had won in 2008 or 2012. Would you be here saying the same thing to all the Ron Paul supporters cheering him on in this forum?
      </p>
      <p>
       The difference is a matter of personal bias. You don't believe Donald Trump is at all similar to Ron Paul. I don't necessarily believe that either. But I do see how it's a possibility that cannot be ruled out at this point.
      </p>
      <p>
       The more desperately people push back against that idea here, the more likely it seems to me that the criminal elite want him gone because he represents a deadly threat against the Deep State.

       There is no $110 billion deal. You have been mislead. The only deals that
       <em>
        may eventually go to the Senate for approval
       </em>
       were deals initiated under the Obama administration. Really, go look into it for yourself and see how easily you find corrections and backtracking on the original story that was shoved down our throats by ShareBlue and mainstream propaganda networks.

      <p>
       This is exactly what I am talking about. There is a desperate effort underway to plaster social media with propaganda intended to persuade people like me to believe that Trump is somehow going back on his campaign promises and working for the globalist agenda. It's possible, but so far I see no reason to believe it. If I change my feelings on that, it's certainly not going to be based on a knee jerk reaction to a low-effort comment on Reddit.

       I see, but maybe it's possible all that "fake news" stuff comes out so the citizens don't know whether to trust MSM or Independent Media; maybe they're both controlled by the same people, at least the more popular ones. I don't know, it's possible trumps on our side, but we all should've learned to remain skeptical until proven otherwise; let alone thinking voting another suit into office will "save us and fix things" like it has with every other president in the past. /s

       Sure, remain skeptical. But there are two sides to that coin. The true skeptical position would allow for the possibility that Trump is legitimately on the side of the people. On the other hand, I see a continuous effort to hijack the skeptical position in this subreddit:
      </p>
      <p>
       "True skeptics know that Trump is just another globalist puppet like every other president."
      </p>
      <p>
       Actually, no, we don't know that. We don't know that he is on our side, either, but we don't know that he's not.
      </p>
      <p>
       After everything we have seen in the past year, I am legitimately ready to believe that Donald Trump is
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       just another suit. I don't know much of anything with certainty. But my gut instinct draws me more and more towards the possibility that he is the real deal. If he manages to reveal the criminal cartel behind the curtain, 
then I will be there to stand with him against any attacks whatsoever.
      </p>
      <p>
       So if this is really happening, wouldn't you (hypothetically) expect to see tremendous pressure to control forums like this one and prevent the masses from truly catching on to his strategy?

       I don't support Trump, but your claim is bullshit. Most of the government is anti-Trump, along with the majority of the mainstream media. By your logic, being anti-Trump can also be considered "government and mainstream media cheerleading."

       Was there anything invalid about what I said? His point has been pretty clearly true for decades, but there's no denying that something funny happened during the last election. It's possible that somebody got into power who wasn't supposed to, and if we pay attention this may finally be an opportunity to shake up the left/right paradigm and blow the whole criminal system wide open.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now that something different
       <em>
        finally
       </em>
       happened in a US election, we have moderators pushing their opinion that this is business like usual and we are attacking the subreddit if we think otherwise.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is literally the strategy laid out in the ShareBlue memos leaked at the beginning of the year: neuter alternative media by compromising discussion forums and pushing the narrative that Trump is a double agent for the NWO.

       Sounds like an attempt not to attack the sub, but to discredit a specific mod.  From what I recall,
       <a href="/u/CelineHagbard">
        /u/CelineHagbard
       </a>
       tends to fall more on the anti-Trump side when posting so this would be out of character for them.

       <a href="/u/CelineHagberd">

       This actually happened a few years ago. There were accounts that had like one letter difference and were used to discredit certain users. I guess they are going after the mods now.
      </p>
      <p>
       The flat earth thing and similar crap that we see in this sub is most definitely due, in large part, to trolling. I'm not saying there are zero actual flat earthers in here because there probably are a few, but these "trolls" are quite dedicated to discrediting the entire sub or specific users, I guess depending on their mood each day.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some people out there really hate conspiracy theorists for some reason and they especially hate this sub, so they do anything they can to stir up nonsense in here and make us look even worse than we already do. They exaggerate how many racists and nazis are in here as well so that they can run around in other subs and claim "
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       is very anti-semitic", and we actually have proof of that.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/62nxah/proven_false_flags_against_rconspiracy_to_make/">
        Proven false flags against /r/conspiracy to make everyone here seem racist.
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       The flat earth nonsense is probably similar as well as many of the other really stupid things you see in this sub. Don't let them convince you that all conspiracy theories are stupid just because they are good at convincingly exaggerating how stupid some of the people are. Remember, any random person can post anything they want in here, so just because some of the content is dumb does not mean that the dumb content is representative or associated with the better stuff.

       If you wouldn't mind, could you send the link of the PM to the admins (message them at
       <a href="/r/reddit.com">

       It's still somewhat a game of whack-a-mole, and they'll probably just make more accounts, but it would be good to at least have this one banned site-wide.

This whole sub is probably made to shill for lefties. You are probably a lefty shill too.

       Oh so he's already using a different account posting the same crap. Banning people really doesn't make sense to me. Scumbags like him got banned, he makes another account and we have to identify him all over again. If I say he's a shill here I could very well get banned myself and lose my account for calling a spade a spade. Oh well it is what it is.

       Don't call anyone a shill. Even when you're right, it's an ad hominem fallacy and not a persuasive argument at all if you have no proof. If a shill says something wrong/deceptive/etc.prove them wrong.

       If he admitted it, it's likely not true.  Maybe the plan was to be intentionally transparent and then blame it on CA so it looks like people on the left are making shitty attacks against people who lean right.

       Because their intentions can't be known beyond the obvious part they are trolling, people need to ignore them.

       His methods were so odd and transparent. It reminded me of those old spam emails from 'Nigerian Prince' that would only fool the really gullible.

       The usual suspects like shareblue are way more refined and subtle with their propaganda compared to him. I doubt he was really working with them or Cambridge.

       Over the past few years I've run the full gambit of emotions when it comes to the mods.   Currently, I believe it's a grpup of good people, each with their own set of beliefs, that are trying their best to keep this sub open and fair to all sides of any argument.  We're all imperfect so drama happens but they've always come out better after big issues.

       I'm not going to get another alternate account banned by naming names and examples.  Sorry dude.  All I'm going to say is that the moderators added in January 2012 are where things started to go to shit and rules started to be made up.  It's still a great subreddit if you browse by new or controversial, but the amount of censorship ensures that the content that used to dominate the subreddit can no longer make it to the top.

       My recommendation is that you tag all of the mods with RES (if you have it).
      </p>
      <p>
       Not only does it prevent situations like this, it can also be an important reminder that the content you're seeing is from a moderator of the sub so it may have a bias (no offense mods, you've done good but we'd be lazy if we didn't accept the possibility of moderator abuse in a conspiracy forum).

       I wish I could.  RES isn't mobile yet and I haven't booted up my laptop in 6 months.  I use a nvidia shield tablet and my new s8+ only =(  and I've been a pc gamer since Ultima Online... it's sad. (Ive been an MMORPG gamer religiously since then)  I blame having kids.

       Some apps might have the ability to tag users, I use
       <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=me.ccrama.redditslide">
        Slide for Reddit
       </a>
       which has a tag user option but not sure about the other apps out there.

       How do you like the Shield tablet? I used to have one but I got rid of it because I found the battery would drain incredibly fast while in idle. I'd set it down and come back to a dead device an hour later.

       I don't have the battery issue.  Maybe you had a hungry app running.  Mins 3+ yrs and I still use it daily.  Best device I've had in ages.  With that said im a stay at home dad so I have it plugged in all the time so that could explain it.  I'm looking forward to the new Nintendo switch actually.  Its not really the same but I think it'll scratch my gaming itch for a while.

       Actually, you are very clearly picking a side with this comment. You are attempting to decide for your users that the current administration is secretly on the same team as the previous administration. It's fine if you believe that, as long as you recognize that it is your own personal bias. We still don't know for sure what is going on with Donald Trump. If he is actually working against the criminal government, then it would make sense for shilling organizations to push your viewpoint on the internet to keep a lid on his public support.

       I'm actually pretty concerned about how nonchalantly you skipped over that blind spot as if it wasn't there.

       is not anti-government by default, it is anti-corruption and anti-authoritarian. Many of us here would love to support our country if it wasn't compromised by Deep State criminals. That's why there is so much grass roots support for Donald Trump on forums that have been traditionally anti-establishment. Many of us see Donald Trump as a possible chance to break the criminal influence in government. It's fine if you disagree, but that is your own personal bias, not a fact. This is a perfectly reasonable forum for discussion of that possibility.

       If he admitted it, it's likely not true.  Maybe the plan was to be intentionally transparent and then blame it on CA so it looks like people on the left are making shitty attacks against people who lean right.

       Because their intentions can't be known beyond the obvious part they are trolling, people need to ignore them.

       Next level conspiracy. Its shills all the way down. Lefty shill shilling for Clinton. Lefty shills pretending to be Trumpers to secretly shill for the left. This whole sub is probably made to shill for lefties. You are probably a lefty shill too. Implying that Trump supporters are lefty shills to make it seem like there are actually less of them than there are.  Get out of here shariablue we are on to you

       I can't believe you got all that from his comment.

       This is exactly what I am talking about. You didn't address anything he said in his comment, but you are trying to use it to justify the tangent you went on.

       I'm just willing to give traditional law enforcement one last chance. If Donald Trump and Jeff Sessions fail at their attempt to take out the global international Mafia, then you may find yourself with a new anarchist brother. But for now, I want to maintain some hope that the traditional perspective on representative government is just working out the last kinks before it finds a balance between protecting individual rights and fighting criminal influence in government.
