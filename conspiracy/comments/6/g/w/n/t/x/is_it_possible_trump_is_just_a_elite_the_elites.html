        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I browse the_donald but I thought that I might give a thought here (I&#39;m not the biggest trump supporter but saw that the elites hated him and figured better then nothing I guess. Also I love all the liberal ownage on r/the_donald.) trump is a elite. Just not as big as a elite as people like Hillary. He wanted the office the rest of the elites did not like that. So they went after him. But at the same time liberals are ruining their careers to get him per say. It doesn&#39;t make sense. Even if they are elected wouldn&#39;t they know better then to ruin their careers and make people like trump more ? Sure you can say they want trump elected and that would make sense. But they ruin their careers (some not all do this). Why ruin your career to make people like him ? I don&#39;t get it. If anyone else would be willing to explain to me why they do it in a way that explains the reason that this happens I&#39;d greatly appreciate it. Also I&#39;m sorry if there isn&#39;t a whole lot of clarification here. I&#39;ve had a real busy week and have another busy week up ahead.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>i was refering more to ppl just seeing the whole entire system for what it is ... oppression i think part of the way trump e
ran his campain helped more ppl see that as well</p>

<p>as for trump now that he is in power ? hes becoming a part of the system theres no denying that. but i trt to remain optimistic that if enough people are fed up with getting shyt  getting shoveld down their throats maybe just maybe trump will think twice before crossing thous with the real power us/you and me.</p>

<p>tl:dr we need to govern ourselves individually and and stop using moneys.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Excuse me, but why do the rich and powerful care if he is president?  Yes, there has been elites fighting over the position for decades, but if one of their &quot;own&quot; became it they shouldn&#39;t care if they got it. So, either Trump could be a part of the elites but also seems like he is not. Where I&#39;m getting at is I don&#39;t think he is a part of this &quot;elite&quot; society and has his own agendas. Maybe the elite society doesn&#39;t even exist or alternatively exist in small groups.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think it&#39;s that they hate him. I think it&#39;s that they can&#39;t control him, and it&#39;s really important to them that they keep control, since their whole house of cards is so precarious. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not a fan of Trump -- I think he&#39;s an absurd narcissist who massively overestimates his own knowledge and intelligence on issues that can&#39;t afford that kind of Dunning-Kruger BS. But that&#39;s the thing -- if you&#39;re going to defy the establishment, you need to actually be able to outsmart them, which takes really REALLY understanding the issues you&#39;re defying them on. Like Bernie Sanders and Jeremy Corbyn. A less than genius establishment politician like George W. Bush can get away with not really understanding key issues because he&#39;ll lean on establishment expertise to fill in the gaps. But Trump is trying to beat the political establishment at their own game while only having a vague sense of the rules, and without the sense to know how in over his head he is. They&#39;re terrified he&#39;s going to break their delicate arrangement designed to manipulate the masses into supporting policies against their own interests, and they&#39;re right to worry. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Money doesn&#39;t make you an elite, connections make you an elite. Money is an absolute prerequisite, but &quot;who you know&quot; is at the heart of the definition. Trump is not an elite in any way, shape or form. He&#39;s wealthy, but he isn&#39;t connected to the &quot;right&quot; people. In fact, he&#39;s apparently networked with exactly the wrong people to be tolerated by the Euro-American Elites.</p>

<p>True elites, generationally-established elites do not want anything to do with so public a position as the presidency. (Except the Bushes, I suppose. Seems like the presidency was the price they paid to fully establish themselves as serious players rather than flash-in-the-pan wannabes. &lt;cough cough Clintons&gt;) Real power doesn&#39;t reveal itself if at all possible.</p>
