        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>So, I was just browsing youtube, and I am currently in the process of watching a &quot;live&quot; therapy session of Katy Perry:</p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/uBj0qJ6bcIg">https://youtu.be/uBj0qJ6bcIg</a></p>

<p>It is beyond disturbing. I am not done yet, but at the very beginning the &quot;therapist&quot; has her switch to her &quot;Katherine&quot; personality.</p>

<p>This woman is in her 30s, and she acts like a 15 year old, at least when she identifies as Katherine.</p>

<p>She mentions cutting her hair, and why she did it. Isn&#39;t it interesting that all of these female celebrities have some sort of breakdown, drastically change their appearance, and then cut off their hair? Her reasoning is that she wanted to be as close to her true self again as possible.</p>

<p>By the way, do a quick search of celebrities and alter egos. For those who do not know, one of the purposes of MK ultra is to break someone&#39;s mind down into many alters so that they are easier to control and enslave.</p>

<p>Anyway, here are some things that are really disturbing me about the video:</p>

<p>1) It feels that they are &quot;normalizing&quot; multiple personalities. They are deceiving the audience to think that it is normal for Katy to have her alter &quot;Katherine.&quot; By the way, I understand that most of us have many sides, but she really does seem to transition into an entirely different personality at the beginning of the video. The therapist is talking to her alter.</p>

<p>2) Therapy should never (or only in rare circumstances) be filmed in this way. Has the world gone entirely mad? What are they trying to get people desensitized to?</p>

<p>3) I am disturbed by the lack of people who still refuse to be even remotely suspicous of the cyclical nature of celebrity rises to fame, mental breakdowns (which usually involves a change to some sort of adrogynous appearance), and then reprogramming (all at the same rehab center by the way). Is this cycle intentional and repeated for a reason? What is the message it is sending, particulary to girls and women? Again, what is being normalized?</p>

<p>4) It is sad. Many of you may think that it is a waste of time to talk about celebrities, and I agree to an extent, but we have to remember this is how our youth is programmed. This is what is normalized. This is what kids are being fed. These are their role models. In other words, their role models are used to propagate a dysfunctional society.</p>

<p>Anyway, this is a quick post, and I really want to hear your thoughts. If nothing else, this is creepy, and I have not even finished watching the video yet.</p>

<p>I have a more detailed post here about my own abuse, and I connect this to mkultra here:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5exvjx/mk_ultra_abuse_and_denial_a_personal_experience?ref=search_posts">https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5exvjx/mk_ultra_abuse_and_denial_a_personal_experience?ref=search_posts</a></p>

<p>Edit: I will post updates as I watch if anyone is interested:</p>

<p>1) The therapist is now telling her she is a goddess.</p>

<p>2) She clearly has severe issues, and the therapist is focusing on a &quot;formula&quot; for success. He is using a lot of pseudoscience and &quot;quack&quot; methods.</p>

<p>3) She does not say &quot;I&quot;. </p>

<p>4) At the very beginning the parents are mentioned, but the therapist diverts from that immediately. Why can she only talk about her childhood with the exclusion of her parents? </p>

<p>Why couldn&#39;t she &quot;play&quot;? Whose fault is that? The blame is placed on her - not her parents.</p>

<p>5) She could not hug because she associated it with sex.</p>

<p>Come on now!!</p>

<p>6) Katherine is 11.</p>

<p>7) He tells her how to position herself in her chair. If she mentions that Katy is there, he redirects it to Katherine.</p>

<p>8) The handler goes back to talking about her hair and how it is an extension of your nervous system. Maybe some truth there. She recently cut her hair.</p>

<p>9) 27 Minutes: She says, &quot;It has probably been from some of my conditioning.&quot;</p>

<p>10) They are talking about &quot;angel&quot; cards.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you&#39;re spot on. This is a darkness that is trying to hide in plain sight. They know the truth is impossible to hide, so the new tactic is normalizing. It&#39;s also interesting how many people understand celebrity programming as a concept now, especially after Kanye. Many of them have been put into scenarios where they are actually participating in massive dark occult rituals as well, in film or music, where they serve an symbolic or archetypal purpose, and the creative work is the incantation or &#39;spell&#39;. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What about the start of the video with an allseeing eye with a globe/earth for a pupil and three Ws on top (world wide web)? That freaked me out so bad I couldn&#39;t watch the video. It&#39;s way too blatant as if they&#39;ve clearly doubled down. And all the comments that feel strangely spambotty as if everyone&#39;s being a &quot;meanie beanie poopy head towards a beautiful person&quot; and &quot;bullying&quot; the man too and even sinister &quot;this is so illuminating&quot;. I saw no mean comments. But I always see at least slightly weirded out people on other videos like her interview with Ellen where she seemed to rapidly switch between personalities causing even her fans to say &quot;that&#39;s not Katy Perry! :(&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Satan is the bad guy in the traditional christian sense. Lucifer in some texts as &quot;Lucifer the light bringer&quot; is believed to be a different thing from Satan who is derived from Saturn who the dark occultist in the elites worship and take a lot of their symbology from.

    <div class="md"><p>Ah, yes. I made the mistake of regressing to my pop-Christian upbringing and lumping the two figures together as one. Lucifer and Christ are a better comparison (than Lucifer and Satan), whereas Satan and God represent the most fundamental ideas of light and dark, good and evil, etc. Two ideas that in Christianity are separated into different characters, but have also been represented by one (like in the case of Abraxas: That which is spoken by God-the-Sun is life; that which is spoken by the Devil is death; Abraxas speaketh that hallowed and accursed word, which is life and death at the same time. Abraxas begetteth truth and lying, good and evil, light and darkness in the same word and in the same act.).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I appreciate that there are groups out there who do worship &#39;satan&#39; or &#39;demons&#39;. I understand the idea of attempting to bring revelations to pass. However, many of the &#39;demons&#39; that some groups worship are gods of religions that have been demonized by the church/bible itself and, while the gods they worship are not the most pleasant of things, they are also not part of the &#39;christian pantheon&#39; for lack of a better term.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moloch">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moloch</a>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minerva">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minerva</a></p>

<p>The above are the two you specifically referenced. They are gods (little g) of different cultures. </p>

<p>It would be like calling Horus a demon, or Anubis (if you prefer a more negative (ish) one)</p>

<p>My point is that words are powerful things that can be accidentally misleading. We need to be aware of this as its one of the things that the elite, whether it be corporations, governments or religions use to create confusion. The SPELL words to cast a SPELL on you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dogma is one of the best tools of evil ever. Look how all these well meaning people insist upon entering delusion and dragging us along for the ride. They are good people, controlled by evil beings.</p>

<p>Evil is simply self-serving behavior at the expense of others. Those that engage in it are parasites on others. It&#39;s a choice and those that make it find themselves opposed to truth and freedom for their targeted hosts. </p>

<p>Ancient, space originating parasites came here and modified our DNA to make us slaves. I&#39;ve heard we are set up to have a visceral reaction to their presence. The act of submitting your will is the key metric in determining the slavery relationship. Even if you think they are angels of God, it works and it&#39;s slavery.</p>

<p>We even do it with each other. Show an isolated tribe some tech toys and many of them will consider you a God. Isn&#39;t that useful if you wanted to control them? </p>

<p>Abusing the indentities of what people perceive are benevolent entities offers a high utility for mind control. These evil beings cannot pass it up. They came here and created religions as well as corrupting existing ones. All of it is to gain our submission to external control. Theyll present themselves as angels or benevolent ETs, beaming good feelings into your chest, controlling you and perhaps even tarnishing the very idea of benevolence in your mind as you throw them off.</p>

<p>I have boiling contempt for dogma. Yet, I&#39;ve had experiences with these beings and even encountered people on reddit who also believe they have. One recent account sounded so much like my own.</p>

<p>It boils down to this from what I can tell. They pretend to be God and intermediaries of God. They sell you that your sins merit punishment, that you have to pay off karma. So they send you to a temporary hell or back into life knowing you will be traumatized. They feed on fear and suffering. They deceive you, because you can actually leave this place after death. They have to fool you to get you to stay. They corrupt life to farm energy from souls. This is one farm of many they have where they feed on the suffering of consciousness. As I said, they are very evil beings. Twisted fits, as what they love is what you&#39;d hate. In fact they love it when you hate them, because it feeds them your negative energy. </p>

I can&#39;t believe I just said &quot;woke.&quot;  Baphomet seem to just be some hip symbol, because the real practitioners believe in a far more complex system then something as simple as hermaphrodite worship.

    <div class="md"><p>Just a heads up for those reading through this thread. </p>

<p>When people talk about the occult, especially on conspiracy forums, they often have no idea what they are talking about. Lots of names and ideas are thrown around with very little comprehension.  This is even sometimes true in occult forums. </p>

<p>I live in LA, I am deeply involved in the occult and am here to say that while there is passing interest and there is some meddling activity regarding the occult and magic, the vast majority is casual dabbling at most  and mere window dressings and ego-decoration. I&#39;m including pedestrians and some A-list celebrities as well. Obviously I don&#39;t know it all and don&#39;t see it all but I have seen a good bit and my intuitions on these things are always correct. Take of that what you will. </p>

<p>Very few really practice any form of magic and fewer still are actually in positions of power and doing nefarious things. </p>

<p>Yes, there are some but they are a minority. Even among those in positions of power who go along with group rituals are careless about the real truth of the matter and the underlying ideas and philosophy that makes up these practices. It&#39;s a show and they get ego gratification from being in an elite club with the decorum of occult power which is very much fetishized. </p>

<p>Far more prevalent is a worldview and mindset, a kind of unconscious selling of one&#39;s soul. It&#39;s &quot;socially acquired psychopathy&quot; via soul crushing boot of modernity that is stripped of REAL magic and made people soul blind. </p>

<p>Mark Passio summarizes it all quite well.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1V98DsNXi0">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1V98DsNXi0</a></p>

<p>Magic and the occult has always been with us and it&#39;s typically polarized towards those in the edges of society: The poor and disenfranchised and those in elite positions of power. It&#39;s the in-between who are generally manipulated by magic. </p>

<p>but keep in mind: Magic is a kind of technology, it&#39;s morally ambiguous and It&#39;s the makers of magic who do good or do evil. Period! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Besides the obvious motive to gain (even more) attention for her album, she also expresses appreciation for the benefits of therapy, saying how it has really helped to heal and restore her relationship with her parents. I think that her promoting the idea of therapy and helping to normalize it is actually a really good thing, that is needed more of in this world. Caring more for one&#39;s mental/emotional health is something that needs to become a greater priority in many people&#39;s lives.</p>

<p>It takes a lot of courage and determination to see a therapist. And often, there is lot of shame tied to admitting that you need help, let alone going to see a professional about it. Yes, it is &quot;dark and weird&quot; and uncomfortable and painful to watch at times, but her showing this session could really encourage others who are struggling with similar issues to seek help to improve their mental health, and it could even save lives.</p>

Just thought it was interesting they took something made for a Godly purpose and turned it into the song dark horse(check out the video to the son g as well if you&#39;ve never seen it).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok, you crossed my suspension of disbelief line. Does the creator of this video really think that comedians doing impressions is evidence of mind control/ multiple personalities? I know MK Ultra was/ is real, but this videos premise is on thin ice 5 minutes in. I&#39;ve even seen/ heard of behavior from Bynes that might be suggestive of multiple personalities, but pretending to be a character on TV for other people&#39;s entertainment is far from a red flag. I&#39;m not finishing this garbage, but at that rate, this video&#39;s going to try to condemn all acting as demonic ritual. Gotta learn to cut the BS from the rest, buddy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Did you even read my post? I&#39;m specifically discussing the credibility of the Amanda Bynes video you just linked. I definitely believe there are elite occultists doing some evil shit in this world (whether the rituals are actually doing anything metaphysical or not is really immaterial, b/c they&#39;re hurting innocent people either way). I don&#39;t even have many holes to poke in the creepy Katy Perry therapy video you originally linked. My problem is that the first 5 minutes of the Amanda Bynes video are basically claiming that acting is proof of multiple personalities, and I call TOTAL HORSESHIT on that. There&#39;s plenty of evidence of Amanda Bynes acting bizarrely, but doing impressions hardly compares to some of the other shit this whacky bitch has gotten up to. Just because I believe in a conspiracy doesn&#39;t mean that every Youtube video that agrees with me is making an actual cogent point about the material in question.</p>

It is literally the MOST common thing for any even semi famous person to talk about the fact that the masses are shit and being famous is shit.  Its not some hidden obstacle people purposefully try to hide or something.  Blaming the masses is kind of ridiculous, artists want to do whatever they want, and still have the affection of the masses, but you cant have your cake and eat it too.

<p>I see.  I wasn&#39;t really trying to imply that, I think it&#39;s a combination of multiple things.  The media,  paparazzi, public demand for celebrities, mass consumption of media, overall celebrity culture, mass production of &quot;art&quot; ... I think the combination of these factors is far more likely than the oversimplification of &quot;MK Ultra&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah i agree, i tend to think that, instead of artists being an active part of the &quot;illuminati&quot;, for lack of a better term, its moreso tptb influencing taste by choosing to push garbage with no substance, which in turn, leads the overrall taste of the public to enjoy garbage more and more.  Its like tptb taking advantage of a situation instead of jay z worshipping the literal devil imo, but who knows maybe im wrong and that is what jay z and most any pop culture icon is abouy</p>

<p>It&#39;s dismissive of the actual problems at hand instead attributing them to conjecture theory nonsense.  It also demonstrates a complete lack of empathy.</p>

<p>You don&#39;t need MK Ultra theories to explain why people who have been under a microscopic spotlight for years eventually go crazy.  To attribute it to things like MK Ultra helps allow the vampire-like drainage of celebrity mental health to continue.</p>

<p>Theories like this allow the root causes of the problems celebrities face to repeat themselves over and over again.</p>

<p>Absolutely, but the people idly theorizing provide an avenue for those who don&#39;t want to be held accountable for these kinds of train wrecks to aimlessly spout off nonsense, distracting from those very issues.  That is my concern.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The people here seem empathetically concerned that Perry is in distress even if they disagree over the cause.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To blame Perry&#39;s problems on &quot;MK Ultra&quot; is the opposite of empathy, it is the inability to consider that there are more troubling issues at hand and put yourself in Perry&#39;s shoes and instead blame abstract nonsense.</p>

<p>Whatever it is, it&#39;s certainly generating exposure,  but not necessarily for her music.

Julia Cherry was probably just so no one drops the dime to TMZ, thats why it was on her trailer and the call sheets, more to throw people off, however some artists have alter egos, Christina Aguilera used to be called Xtina on set, and there are other weird nicknames for artists ive been doing this shit 10 years </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just imagine what it must be like to be a celebrity - a break out musician for instance.</p>

<p>You go from someone whose struggling financially, probably with a large circle of reliable good friends,  to massively famous and wealthy over the span of several years - possibly months.  Your world is flipped upside down.   You go from dirt poor to banking millions of dollars.    Instead of being a 60 year old entrepreneur whose struggled and sacrificed to reach this plateau over 40 years - you are 21 years old.   You have no idea how to process this success,  what to do with it, or how to defend yourself from what is coming.   Immediately your circle of real friends is replaced by the Hollywood afterbirth crowd - lackeys, clingers, ego-fuelers.    People who tell you how awesome you are 24/7 so you continue to pay their absurd salaries or support their products.   Personal bodyguards,  stylists,  agents,  branding specialists..  etc.   These people become your friends now.   And now to sustain this new circle of friends you must continue to earn, earn, earn.. because thats what makes these new friends like you.   You&#39;ve been utterly compromised by a cabal of professional con artists and are stuck working for them.   Think about it - Just by posting a picture on instagram of you wearing some unknown jewelry brand,  you can make that brand thousands of dollars.   With that sort of power in your hands - people will swarm you and try to con you 24/7.   The gap between reality and the constant deceits will become blurrier and blurrier.   Since you lack the real-life experiences to understand normalcy,  you may slip into this world of weirdness permanently.   Who is being real and who is trying to latch onto your success?   Living in this world of paranoia without the compass to navigate it leads to insanity.     </p>

<p>Just to bring this back to Katy Perry - i remember a few years ago she did a concert back in her home town.   She actually saw one of her old boyfriends in the audience of the crowd... and she pointed him out to ridicule him.   It was really strange at the time.   The poor guy just shrugged the abuse off.. and told the media afterwards that he was perfectly happy with the way things turned out (he ended up marrying some other, far-less famous,  but sane girl.)   Katy Perry&#39;s persistence in singling out this dude was remarkable though.   Why would she care?   Unless, perhaps,  being a celebrity wasn&#39;t the greatest thing ever.   And she knew it.    </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Something is weird with her, no doubt. Do you know the context of the therapy session? She was part of a 72 hour live stream event (like the show Big Brother) promoting her album. The therapy session was part of this. Part of me thinks it&#39;s staged to sell albums. They could&#39;ve easily not shown the therapy session, but they did. Now look what&#39;s happening (everybody is talking about her).  <a href="http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop/7825950/katy-perry-los-angeles-concert-live-stream-finale">http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop/7825950/katy-perry-los-angeles-concert-live-stream-finale</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>So, I&#39;m sure you&#39;re an expert in psychology, but just to offer the other side.....she was young, and came in to fame unlike you or anyone on here has ever known.  I can&#39;t even fathom what it would be like to be in my 20&#39;s with a never ending bank account, pretty much living out your every dream while everyone you know is coming at you with an agenda or trying to get money from you.  This same shit happens to all these kids that get rich young.  Britney, Justin T, Justin B, the list goes on and on.  This isn&#39;t unique or special, and neither is Katy perry. Her given name is Katherine, and she probably reverts back to it because life was less complicated when she was a kid/teen.  Can you imagine the type of psychological pressure someone like her is under?  Just for a second, try to put yourself in her shoes, and see how crazy you&#39;d go.  Sure, the money is great, but that wears off eventually. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Pasting from my other comment:</p>

<p>I think that is all part of it, of course. But there seems to some distinct patterns:</p>

<p>1) Parents putting their kids in acting at an extremely early age.</p>

<p>2) Claims of abuse in childhood</p>

<p>3) Alter egos</p>

<p>4) &quot;Handlers&quot;</p>

<p>5) Breakdowns around the same age (late 20s, early 30s)</p>

<p>6) Rehabilitation at the same center</p>

<p>7) References to mkultra and monarch programming in music, videos, etc.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thousands of parents put thousands of kids into acting/singing/dancing, etc., from a very early age.  A lot of parents have their reasons, living vicariously through their kids or something. </p>

<p>Plenty of them have alter egos (garth brooks and his alter ego, for example) for their own personal reasons.  They breakdown around the same age as anyone else would.  Lots of mental illness manifests in your 20s, and imagine if you couldn&#39;t stop, no matter how sick you were? </p>

<p>They go to the same center because they&#39;re huge celebrities.  They can afford the privacy, the location, etc.  But usually the facility is not JUST for celebrities, it&#39;ll accept other people too, but you don&#39;t hear about them because they&#39;re not famous.  </p>

<p>There&#39;s probably plenty of examples of mind control out there, but this isn&#39;t one of them. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Focusing on your personal experience...Why do you feel there was a connection between the abuse you endured and MK Ultra, and not you just having had the unfortunate &quot;luck&quot; of being in relationships with shitty people? I&#39;ve always wondered this ever since learning about MK Ultra/illunimati/Monarch programming. Since it seems traumatic abuse is the best method to successfully program and control their subjects, usually starting the abuse at a very young age, does this mean that every person that has or had been abused is just being programmed or brain washed in order to control them? </p>

<p>Also, why? What is the purpose of it all? I&#39;ve been reading up on this stuff for awhile now, but I still haven&#39;t come across a reason or a theory behind it beyond creating a NWO. So even though I keep hearing &quot;because, NWO.&quot;, I don&#39;t understand what the end goal is. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know this thread is old, but I also had the same thoughts when I saw the video. I still don&#39;t know what do think about MK Ultra as I&#39;ve read a lot about it, but there is no believable evidence besides the celeb breakdowns and the repeated use of certain symbols in their videos. A lot can be explained by the insane pressure of having millions of people watch a single celebrity. This alone is so much insanity, it would be enough to explain a lot of breakdowns.</p>

<p>Of course Katy&#39;s last album and her latest videos have the one eye all over them, it&#39;s hard to ignore that. </p>

<p>This videos is really disturbing because it practically shows all of the mind control stuff that you can read about. What I found most disturbing is that he said that she is a &quot;priestess&quot; or &quot;goddess&quot; and that she inspires millions. Her father said he was weeping at one of her concerts because he thought the crowd was worshipping the wrong thing.</p>

<p>Is pop music really something that is religious? That&#39;s just sick and even thinking that Katy, a normal human being, could be a &quot;goddess&quot; is twisted and crazy. </p>

<p>Also that she couldn&#39;t hug people because she thought it was sexual. This was a huge red flag for me pointing to possible sexual abuse. That way she never learnt to distinguish between normal physical contact and sexual contact. Again, something that has been mentioned a thousand times about MK ultra.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know when he said that or in what context he said that. Usually when a therapist says that they mean that people can only save themselves, from within. And no external force will heal them through a miracle. </p>

<p>Do you know that many times a pop performance will have a religious background? Like Beyonce dressing up as <a href="https://vigilantcitizen.com/musicbusiness/grammy-awards-2017-protesting-king-worshiping-queen/">Oshun</a>. There are many examples, but it&#39;s seriously disturbing. And this therapist called Katy a priestess or goddess, isn&#39;t that creepy?</p>

<p>Also he mentioned something about the occult I&#39;ve read again and again. He talked about attention and energy. I can&#39;t explain it really as I don&#39;t understand it well enough, but it seems that it&#39;s desirable in the occult to have many people direct their attention onto one thing, like to a concert at the Super Bowl.</p>

<p>I found it so creepy when he tried to steer her into the direction that she wants to have a powerful, wealthy man that is older than her. Even though she said something completely different. Just think of all the sleazy old men who have wives that are the age of their daughters.</p>

<p>Lastly people like him who suggest that &quot;chronic&quot; disease has something to do with the way we behave or that it can be talked away can just go and fuck themselves. I find this personally incredibly insulting and I can&#39;t believe that a person like Katy would listen to such a snakes oil sales man.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The thing I found interesting is that she said that Katherine was 11. Then she talked about how when she was 10 - 12 she started going to Nashville to become a better performer and &quot;learn&quot;. Then she quickly said that she loved Nashville. The idea that she&#39;s stuck at 11 and that she never learned to hug indicates that she may have been sexually abused at 11 before developing. I think that this would be in line with what many (Kesha) have spoken about in the industry regarding girls getting abused to get in the industry. I think that beyond the dangers of fame anyone who has a child and gets them in the industry should take note of this video and choose a better life for their child. </p>
