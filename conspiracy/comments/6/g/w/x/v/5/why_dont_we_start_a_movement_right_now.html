       Well, guys, this is not that kind of "movement" about putting together a crowd and going screaming for anything --- This is all about making it clear that we the people run this system, and the so called "elite" has no real power but delusional one, consented power.
      </p>
      <p>
       The way we accomplish this is by gettingeveryone to stop for a while -- Only to show who's boss --

       Isn't that what Occupy Wall Street was supposed to be about?  If I remember correctly, sadly the very people who should have been all about it were too busy condemning it.  Which is the way it seems to go quite a bit these days.

       No! There are millions of Americans being underpaid right now. Unable to afford a house, so the rent is sucking their money away. If a "majority" of people formed to demand change, there would be "riots," or mass protests that turned violent. The National guard gets called in and never gets relieved of their duty.

       We need to swarm government buildings with pictures of cabal members and a sign above that reads:
      </p>
      <p>
       TRAITOR
      </p>
      <p>
       Each one of us carry our favorite cabal member. One person takes mcccain, another Rothschild, another Soros, and so on.
      </p>
      <p>
       We all march at the closest and most important government building whether that means the city hall or the white house.
      </p>
      <p>
       Get a bunch of videos and upload to YouTube to show our fellow Americans how it's done. It will then motivate them to join us.
      </p>
      <p>
       These protests would be streamed live and we would call out cabal members on live feed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Honestly, this would work.

       It won't work moreover you risk being arrested. The best thing to do right now is educate people you come in contact with. I've been talking to my coworkers and got 3 people interested in all this.
      </p>
      <p>
       From my experience, if you do something extremely drastic people will turn away from you and they will refuse to believe what you have to say. Start slowly and get them curious about what is happening in the world. For example, ask them what is inflation? More than 90% of people responded as "over time the prices of commodities rise". When I told them "have you considered that your value of currency goes down instead of price rise? Can it still explain why everything becomes expensive?".
      </p>
      <p>
       I fully understand this process is slow but I've been doing this for over 5 years.

       That pretty much tells you everything you need to know about what's wrong with this country. And you'll never get 20% economic growth in this country again. Give rich people their tax dollars back and they'll either pad their bank accounts or invest it in foreign markets with a higher rate of return.

        Just how profitable?
       </p>
       <p>
        With increased luminosity in space, enhanced exposure time, and the ability to deliver base loads, solar panels pay for themselves in only 1-2 years while having a 20 year life time.
       </p>
       <p>
        In other words ,if you put $5 trillion of solar panels into space, you get your $5 trillion back by the end of year two and a $5 trillion income stream each year thereafter.
       </p>
       <p>
        In other words, the US could cut everyone's taxes, both personal and business, income, capital, death, or otherwise, all to 0%, not even cut any benefits or current spending, and pay off the national debt within a decade
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       This one income stream generates 5 Trillion dollars a year with no debt.  What is the government going to do with that extra 5Trillion dollars, lets use your excuse "It serves benefit to the citizens because it is used on services to benefit them. "
      </p>
      <p>
       There you go, this can be done without taxes

       You're getting way ahead of yourself. Who said we are going to win? I'm all for a good ol fashioned revolution as much as the next guy but this is going to be a monumental task to say the least. Need to be more focused on the "How to" aspect.

       You want to know something funny?  If you go against the government these days, you are going to be labeled a terrorist.  Yet, the government isn't going to listen to its citizens until we bring them to their knees.  That means disrupting their means of operation hard and fast before they can prepare.  Not just stupid protests in the street, but I mean actually going and destroying their assets that they use to control you.  But if you do that, you will be painted as a fucking terrorist and no one will support you.  This kind of manipulation is exactly what TPTB uses to control us.  To turn us against each other.  We need to break that cycle.  We need to be the ones to write history, not them.

       Your statements are vague. Most people don't even think anything is wrong. Standing on a mountain top shouting isn't going to do much. Who are your allies? Who is your adversary?, What concrete objectives do you have? How is your plan organized? etc. Are you willing to lead by example and possibly screw up your life?
