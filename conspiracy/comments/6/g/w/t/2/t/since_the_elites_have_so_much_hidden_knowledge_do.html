       Just think about how old their hidden knowledge goes, they like to show it off all the time. It goes back at least when Saturn was our sun and probably even before that when you think about the true origin of humans. I feel like even if I dedicated my whole life to researching the conspiracies I could barely scratch the surface.
      </p>
      <p>
       Due to my own knowledge, I do know I have what it takes to fight back, the fact they are so evil also motivates me. But I'm also realistic about my chances of success. At the same time, all that responsability scares me a little.

       My point is, what if taking out (ie winning against) TPTB is not the point of this "experience"? Your soul being, imo, chose to be here at this time for a reason. It's not necessarily material in nature, but a challenge of either ascending or descending in the astral realm... So is the battle truly outward or  is it inside you?

       It really is inward because when enough people withdraw consent from the elite, then they start falling apart faster. If enough people stop fearing the elite, we will get off our asses and march. These types.

       Now you're starting to get it. They need your fearful consent.. That's were they get their power, with the help from their "negative" inter-dimensional beings they conjure/worship.

       It is primarily a thought war, they spend a lot of time keeping the thoughts of the masses separated, distracted and directed at the wrong target.

       If we would stop attacking each other and the targets they set up and focus on moving right past them we could.  No guns or bombs are needed.

       Let's cut the conspiracy thing down to what it matters - That we are controlled and manipulated, make it a thing, sinthesize in a clear and objective way why and how things are fucked and what we can do about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Make it a
       <strong>
        godamn fucking movement
       </strong>
       , with a fucking name, but with no face, just to ensure nothing resembling "positon of power".

      <p>
       Then my friends, let's
       <strong>
        Gandhi
       </strong>
       the fuck out of it -- Let's just stop -- Yeap.
      </p>
      <p>
       The one thing we need is to all people around the earth to stop for one day. Or perhaps more.
      </p>
      <p>
       This will show
       <strong>
        who the fuck is the actual boss, and runs all this shit down to the fucking all of it
       </strong>

       Look man, the answer is simple but the loudest causeheads will be the first to dismiss it:  Debt-free, Constitutional Cryptocurrency.  The government leases huge blocks of crypto to regional banks who accept those blocks in the form of paper currency.  Banks lends that paper (or further, digital representations of the physical paper) to businesses and individuals who then circulate the new currency simply by conducting their day-to-day transactions.

       Of course, that would require President Trump have the political will and support of the people needed to abolish the Federal Reserve.

       I think we can. I gotta believe we can, other wise what is the fucking point of this? 9-5 till I'm 80, no thanks. I've already been 7 years a slave in a warehouse, that's enough. :P

       Knowledge, health, mind, body, soul, the arts. These things should weigh above all else and yet they don't. We care for money, the ironic thing is they don't even care. Money is not power, it just comes with the gig.

       They've built a fake system for us to stumble around like baffoons, arguing, fighting and talking about nothing. Whilst they continue to grow in power.

       This is the apocalypse. All the hidden knowledge is being revealed. And you're right, we don't know much about anything.
      </p>
      <p>
       But we know enough to care about the truth. This is scripted and if you've read your Stephen King you know the good guys always win. We lose people along the way but they aren't really lost.

       You might be interested in Manly P. Halls book, 'The Secret Teaching Of All Ages'. It's over 600 pages, but I bet it barely scratches the surface. I have it and have skimmed through it. It's very interesting and I think there's a chapter about Saturn in there.

       I think we'll win in the end. I believe there's infighting within the elites. There's a light faction fighting to free humanity. Plus people are waking up at an exponential rate, so there's that too.

       There is very little truly hidden knowledge anymore.  Examine the mystery schools.  Google everything you can find about "The _________ Mysteries," and then work your way forward.

       My point is, what if taking out (ie winning against) TPTB is not the point of this "experience"? Your soul being, imo, chose to be here at this time for a reason. It's not necessarily material in nature, but a challenge of either ascending or descending in the astral realm... So is the battle truly outward or  is it inside you?
