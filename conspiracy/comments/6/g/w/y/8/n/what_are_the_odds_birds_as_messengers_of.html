        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The following is a intimate story of my experiences with numbers, synchronicity and metaphor. Please read the whole thing as this is a compilation of the last couple years of my life in relation to synchronicity. Hey folks I have had another series of synchronicities that like comedy have tons of &quot;callbacks&quot; to previous syncs.</p>

<p>So this post is about birds. I would like to share with you the things Ive learned from my interactions of birds.</p>

<p>Ill start at the beginning of my awakening so too speak. back in 2014. It all goes back to earth day 4-22-14. On this day my wife and i began a tradition of making psychedelic mushroom tea. This was our first time making it so we added some shamanic ritual elements to strengthen and offer a form of respect to the activity we were undertaking. Acknowledging our gift from the earth. And what could be a greater gift than offering you an alternative perspective.</p>

<p>My first experience with a heron came suddenly and gave me a perfect metaphor of life and death. Nature and rebirth.</p>

<p>I opened the door to my garage one day and the opening of the garage was blacked out by a massive bird, A blue Heron. He flew across the opening from the direction of our fish pond. I already knew that something was up so i went to the fish pond.</p>

<p>At the pond i was greeted with a type of wanton destruction i hadn&#39;t witnessed before. Fish guts and pieces lay strewn about half eaten. There were no more fish left in the pond. It was like the heron was just wreaking havoc and chaos instead of just satisfying his hunger.</p>

<p>That was the Fish holocaust of 2013. So fall turns into winter and the pond freezes over. Time passes and yet as the Ice melted and nature began to wake back up a miraculous thing was witnessed. Under the ice as it was melting i noticed these little dots flitting about underneath.</p>

<p>In a week the ice had fully melted and we had a handful of of minnows swimming around. What was once the site of chaos and death became once again a bastion for life.</p>

<p>In my research i found <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bennu">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bennu</a></p>

<p>The Egyptian god of rebirth and the precursor to the phoenix. If the story i just described doesn&#39;t fit so perfectly i don&#39;t know what could.</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t really start experiencing syncs until a little later. Flash forward to earth day where we take a nice batch of mushroom tea and have such a wonderful experience.</p>

<p>At one point my wife was lying on her side and the lone tree in our neighbors yard ended up reflecting in her eyes so beautifully it was the tree was growing from her pupil.</p>

<p>She asks me what my favorite color is and i blurt out triangles. In my mind i was thinking about how everything is triangles you have the duality of a thing and that third element creates a balance between the 2.</p>

<p>So triangles became a keyword and synchronistic thing from that day on.</p>

<p>The day after earth day i go to work and for my job at that time i would spin signs or juggle in front of them to bring in people to the business. And as i am juggling a woman pulls of to the side of the road and gets out.</p>

<p>She asks me if i did birthday parties or performed for other events i said most certainly. and she gave me her card. Needless to say i was pretty tickled at the random chance of this person seeing me, getting the courage to talk to me and actually going forward with it.</p>

<p>So i go to my car on my break (it was a super hot day) i get in the cart and blast the AC and remember to put the card somewhere i wouldn&#39;t lose it.</p>

<p>The cards address was 5555 TRIANGLE parkway. I was floored as not only does it specifically reference the word that became such a prominent point from the day previous. It also had 5555 consecutive digits. So at this point i pray and ask for a sign that this is some sort of message.</p>

<p>I go back out to my street corner and start juggling again, and i notice the nearly full moon in the daytime sky and think how beautiful it is. At that moment i noticed a Blue heron fly by the moon. I instantly took it as a sign as something special.</p>

<p>I went home and dove into research into the heron and found alot if intriguing things.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.beingbreath.com/blog/the-message-of-the-blue-heron.html">http://www.beingbreath.com/blog/the-message-of-the-blue-heron.html</a></p>

<p>specifically talks about synchronicity in relation to the bird.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.spirit-animals.com/heron/">https://www.spirit-animals.com/heron/</a></p>

<p>describes me too a T.</p>

<p>I also found Bennu the Egyptian god. and the Asteroid named bennu. Which became the asteroid Nasa decided to send OsirusREX to take samples from. I found this out right before my birthday on June 30th. Which i also found out is Asteroid awareness day.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tunguska_event">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tunguska_event</a></p>

<p>Asteroid awareness day is listed as being June 30th. With the first one taking place on June 30th 2015. A couple months before experiencing the sync chain. It was 107 years after the Tunguska event, the largest explosion measured supposedly caused by a asteroid exploding in the atmosphere and flattening a large swath of trees and land.</p>

<p>Flash forward 1 year later and I was getting into a blog called daily crow, which talks about days between dates and number synchronicities linked up with biblical metaphor. On the Fb page people were talking about Tungsten and Donald tungs ect. So my mind immediately thought of the word Tunguska and I was also at the time getting into Google earth and looking at distances between megalithic structures and other various links brought to my attention by secrets in plain sight.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L777RhL_Fz4">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L777RhL_Fz4</a></p>

<p>So this is one of the biggest oddities of this whole experience, I had Tunguska brought back into memory via a reference to Tungsten Tungs ect. I then had the idea to look at the distance between the white house to the impact explosion of the Tunguska event. For such a random thing to seek out I was very surprised and flabbergasted that the distance was exactly 5555.55 miles EXACTLY north of the white house. The line is so straight that if you walked out of the Whitehouse and went straight for 5555.55 miles you would be standing in the impact crater of the largest recorded explosion in history!</p>

<p>To recap a little I Had an experience with a heron that was unforgettable, it taught me a parable of life and death and the beauty and terror of nature. I then asked for a sign after seeing 5555 triangle parkway on a card given to me by a stranger. The heron flew in front of the moon. I researched herons and found out they were the precursors to the Greek phoenix. A metaphor likened to what I had experienced personally. Also Bennu is the Egyptian god of rebirth and resurrection. Bennu was highlighted in an article about the upcoming asteroid awareness day on June 30th. As bennu is also the asteroid that nasa chose too take samples from. Asteroid awareness day is based on the Tunguska event when an asteroid exploded in the atmosphere above Russia. A year after all this initial research and dot connection I had that whimsical idea to check the distance from the Whitehouse to the impact zone. And the number directly referenced 5555.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/101955_Bennu">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/101955_Bennu</a> As an aside, but important to me is the discovery of bennu was 9-11-1999. Sept 11th like most people was a big awakening for me.</p>

<p>Wow so you can see the levels and depth at play here. And the referencing back to previous moments of synchronicity. Which causes a snowball effect feedback loop that builds on itself fractally.</p>

<p>Let me explain. So right after I check google earth and found that 5555 link I experienced a surge of emotional energy. A type of nervous excitement, so I went outside for my break. I almost always juggle on my break to wind down a bit. So I turned on google played and played a popular EDM channel. The song that played was Harder, better, faster, stronger. After just that one song I felt drained and sat down and pulled up the internet on my phone.</p>

<p>I google 5555 and the top result is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstella_5555:_The_5tory_of_the_5ecret_5tar_5ystem">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstella_5555:_The_5tory_of_the_5ecret_5tar_5ystem</a> This is an animated film/ music video film that goes with Daft punks music.</p>

<p>So a random song played after I saw 5555.55 miles from Tunguska to the WH that is apart of a film called 5555…. And just under this as if to be the punchline of some cosmic comedy. I see that in Thai 5 is pronounced “HA” and in internet speak 5555 is slang for lol or HAHAHAHA. I mean REALLY!!!!</p>

<p>This day was even more amplified as it was on 4-27-15 and when I came in that day I stood in front of the clockin station for like 5 mins because I could NOT for the life of me remember my clock in number. I started sweating and getting nervous and then I thought today is 4-27 my clock in number cant be that or I would have realized it. I then clocked in. What’s more odd is I have clocked in and out with this code for 6 times a day for over a year. I came into the office and proclaimed it as my day.</p>

<p>So What you’ve read so far is some context to flesh out the stories I’m going to tell you. It may seem like alot and It is. But everything I’ve mentioned connects back fractally.</p>

<p>So the most recent synch chain experience was brought on in the Retconned forum, (like so many other syncs) <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Retconned/comments/6flnuc/persistent_dream_theory/">https://www.reddit.com/r/Retconned/comments/6flnuc/persistent_dream_theory/</a></p>

<p>Autogenesreloaded posted about dreams and other similar things I had been experiencing or researching. I replied about lucidity and dreams and other forces of nature. Right after posting that I read this post I saw another post about Birds being messengers of synchronicity</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Retconned/comments/6fr15z/do_you_have_pets/">https://www.reddit.com/r/Retconned/comments/6fr15z/do_you_have_pets/</a></p>

<p>I replied to his post with Wow seeing Lucidity in bold after just replying to another of your posts specifically detailing lucidity. Lucy, Lucid, Lucifer, Sophia, Gaia, Wisdom, Fires of Prometheus.</p>

<p>I know exactly what you are talking about the birds that get right in the center of your vision.A month or so ago, i asked for a sign from the universe. The next day i am sitting outside looking out into the woods in my backyard and i notice a crow flys right into the center of my vision. I look away a bit and think a little more and the crow flys back into the center of my vision.</p>

<p>So that is when im like OK lets test this, i looked much further away than previously, waited and the crow flew right into sight once again. This went on for 7 times until i decided to stop testing it.</p>

<p>The next day im sitting outside in the same chair and Another crow comes into my center of focus. He has a stick in his mouth like a dog. he is at a lower branch of a pine tree and i watch as he HOPs up the tree branch by branch until arriving at the top where he places the stick and as i realize hes building a nest i see a second crow come in with another stick and realize they are making a family nest.</p>

<p>Ive seen the crows (and heard) daily and they are an uplifting sight for some reason.</p>

<p>As a big sync i am a big follower of The Daily Crow, a blog about numbers, date counts and biblical metaphors playing out on the worlds stage.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.dailycrow.com/o-jerusalem-and-matters-of-solomon/#more-7411">http://www.dailycrow.com/o-jerusalem-and-matters-of-solomon/#more-7411</a></p>

<p>Give this a look. its certainly a very...... precise world we live in.</p>

<p>I posted this at work last week. I then drove home and experienced this I tried adding to my post last night but my phone was going nuts and died In the middle of writing it out.</p>

<p>Start post……….</p>

<p>I had one the most &quot;in your face sync experiences last night. I wrote my previous post at work. And when i got home around midnight their was a bird in my garage. I entered the garage and he freaked out flying around my head in circles. I had to duck down for fear of him hitting me and getting hurt. After about 7 or 8 cycles around my head he landed in some sting lights we have draped across the ceiling.</p>

<p>He paused cocked his head looking at me intently. It very rare I make eye contact with a wild bird but we locked gazes for a long instant. He then trilled a beautiful tweet and flew out of the garage.</p>

<p>I stood there stunned for a couple moments and went inside to tell my wife about the post to you about birds being messengers. And about the bird in the garage. I then went outside to do my nightly juggling practice.</p>

<p>I use Google play and choose a new channel each time and in the past I&#39;ve had startling synchronicitys between life and reality and the names and themes of the songs that randomly are arranged each time you choose a playlist. For instance on the day I learned about the froot loops flip flop I stopped on a song that had a picture of froot loops as the album cover.</p>

<p>The first song was named &quot;goddess&quot; and I was out juggling under the full moon. Which after reflection I remembered that the moon represents the feminine force.</p>

<p>The last song to play was titled &quot;genesis&quot; and I thought to myself that&#39;s been a popular thing in my syncs but it doesn&#39;t quite apply here. Then I &quot;rememberered&quot; your name autogenesisreloaded...... or that&#39;s what I thought. I had missremebered your handle which isn&#39;t a Mandela effect but rather a missreading and filing away of your name in my memory.</p>

<p>As I was attempting to write my reply last night my wife came outside and her phone was playing music in her pocket and the song was &quot; fly hummingbird&quot;</p>

<p>It&#39;s funny you mentioned a red bird. When I was researching the occult I dabbled in chaos magik and my first sigil was made to be &quot; I will see a red bird&quot;. I chose something simple and probable as chaos magik doesn&#39;t just make things happen. It increases the natural probability of the event occurring. You want to choose an initial spell that has a high chance of occurring naturally. Then once the thing you wrote down happens then you meditate and convince yourself it was your will that achieved the effect on reality.</p>

<p>For me it didn&#39;t take alot of convincing. The key with sigils is charging them and then forgetting the command. Once the memory of it has faded and doesn&#39;t pop back into the mind then the subconscious picks it up and...... does something I&#39;m not sure quite what. But in my personal experiences it has proven it&#39;s efficacy.</p>

<p>After I wrote the sigil I went to work the next day and as I went outside there was a cardinal sitting on the fountain in front of the garage. The forgetting of the sigil must have worked because I didn&#39;t register seeing the bird as anything significant. I then walked out to the car and saw another cardinal on the front yard fountain. And that was when i remembered oh yeah I did this. Hello bird. So I drove to work And on my way I was almost hit by a &quot;birds eye&quot; vegatble truck. With bird written in red.</p>

<p>So i saw two red birds on fountains and a red bird as the word on a truck that nearly hit me.</p>

<p>And today I was outside juggling and all of a sudden 2 male cardinals start fighting on the ground in front of me. I freeze watching them tussle on pavement until they froze realizing I was there. Another long pause and they both fly off onto the woods.</p>

<p>So i had 2 odd experiences with birds back to back right after writing about previous synchronicitys with birds. Im outside writing this and hear crows and cardinals cawwing and tweeting away. End post….</p>

<p>So it continues…. The day after I posted my second reply to Autogenesreloaded I had a continuation of bird experiences that rolled it all up so nicely. I was juggling yet again and looked up in the sky and noticed the moon chilling again in the daytime. Then I saw A HERON fly by the moon once again. He came over the yard and the 2 crows that made a nest by the house got a little uppity and flew over to pester the Heron. They flew over cawing their distaste at the big birds presence and attempted to strike the heron. The heron then let out a gurgled moan. It was a startling and weird sound.</p>

<p>I thought wow to be so involved with talking about synchronicity and birds and then having a direct reference to the first synchronicity via the heron was incredible.</p>

<p>Later that night My wife and I were supposed to visit our agent to meet down by the river to do a video shoot for us fire spinning. That’s our hobby job lol. So we are down at the river filming and my wife lights up her hula hoop and is being filmed spinning while I spot. A little ways into the spin I heard that Gurgled moan that the heron made earlier that day when interacting with the crows. I looked out into the river and a Heron flew down and landed behind my wife while she was spinning. And he stayed their until it got too dark for us too see him. This was important and magnified because I had just told my wife about seeing the heron that day with the crows. So she was able to share the synchronicity.</p>

<p>Last note of the day I found this</p>

<p><a href="http://www.memidex.com/heron-of-alexandria">http://www.memidex.com/heron-of-alexandria</a></p>

<p>Heron and Triangles. Direct correlation.</p>

<p>I opened up reddit to post this and this is the top post :P</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No i understand why. It is hard to hold too many ideas in your head and it can be confusing and jarring. Dont worry are get argry with yourself. Just give it a couple reads and let things settle in your mind. That tension you feel should start to diminish. </p>

<p>Remember to think before you speak as well. 10 minutes isn&#39;t long enough to read and digest the content provided. Let alone come to the conclusion you know someone and hate them and everyone like them. </p>

<p>Try and fight that initial Cognitive dissonance and get past those feelings of hate and confusion. I believe you can do it.</p>

<p>Take care. Mr or Mrs Tranny.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>11:11 is a big sync too me 22. My wife always said eleven eleven make a wish a couple years before she met me. And when Iooked up the gematria for my name it was 11 for my  first name and 11 for my last name. Whenever you see a number that resonated with you like that try and think of thw thought you were having right before the synchronicity.  If you were thinking of some thing worth looking  into then Google it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Many of time I&#39;ve thought some crazy, stoned theory or idea when I&#39;m washing the dishes or something, very soon after I&#39;ll see something online making me think I called it and I&#39;m on the right track. </p>

<p>Made a shitty Java program for an assignment the day. &quot;The year is 2160, not much has changed accept the German&#39;s won the war of 2020, now they are involved in everything, Seven Nations rugby cup is about to begin. White Stripe&#39;s Seven Nation Armies distinctive baseline can be heard over the roar of the crowd&quot;</p>

<p>As I played through that, White Stripes Seven Nation Army started to play on RadioX in the other room like I&#39;m Chuck the prophet or someshit. Probs a coincidence but I was like waah!? :P</p>

<p>As far as I recall I can&#39;t remember anything personal experiences relating to 22. Any other numbers of significents? So you are pretty confident there&#39;s something there? The Pyramids, the Egyptians themselves, geometry, numerology, symbology it needs to be looked at carefully, together. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve asked for a sign recently. Just somethiing so I know I&#39;m on a true path, The doubt is still there but atm I&#39;m just having a lil faith.  Like &quot;Know thyself and you shall know the universe and its Gods&quot; I&#39;m going with, I know whats true, I know what feels right and what feels wrong. Trust thyself :D</p>

<p>Let me know if anything else happens man :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Most definitely  the Egyptians knew shift. The pyramids of Gina are 1234.5 nautical miles  away from the pyramids of Mexico and the avenue of the dead which translates to 6666 kilometers. And from Mecca to the temple mount is 123.4 km and 66. 6 Nautical miles. The blatant numbers are out there for eyes too see.</p>

<p>How about a succinct synopsis for fuck&#39;s sake?  It&#39;s incredible how important you must believe yourself to be to believe that your entire wall of text should be consumed without hesitation by complete strangers.  I could go on a lengthy rant about how thoroughly irritated I am by your unapologetic display of self-absorption, but I respect other peoples&#39; time.</p>

<p>tldr;  Write a fucking tldr;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In the Aztec Mayan civilizations they the puma which was their animal connection to the earthly realms and the condor is the higher self flying high above. I&#39;m In the Gnostic texts the secret book of John Jesus comes to John as an eagle. I think about  how little data existed for synchronictys to occur. We have all these numbers in time and dates and all sorts of movies and stories ro draw metaphor from. But back in the day you only had nature to give you signs and guidance. That and dreams helped teach man to man. And television &quot;programming&quot; and movies to show us how to behave in various situations. It&#39;s alot like monkey see monkey do, as we live in a tribal memetic society. We mimic the behaviors of others and there is enough saturation over the generations that how we are &quot;supposed&quot; to behave. Even conspiracy theorists when watching those we identify with pick up subtle and subconscious tweaks to us. Everything we read and hear affects the subconscious even if consciously we reject an idea.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have a red tail hawk as a guide. His Name is skyhawk and that bird has been a significant part of my life for the last 3-4 years. I also relate to the number 33. Which has a lot of meaning tied to it. At first I thought people would think I was batshit crazy now I can care less. Once you acknowledge skyhawk he seems to make himself visible to others as well. I have tons of cool stories and how he&#39;s connected so many dots for me but my favorite is when I found out I was going to be a godmother I looked outside and a hawk was perched in the tree branch next to my future godchilds nursery. To this day (she&#39;s almost a year old) a hawk comes to visit her almost every day  on the same branch </p>
