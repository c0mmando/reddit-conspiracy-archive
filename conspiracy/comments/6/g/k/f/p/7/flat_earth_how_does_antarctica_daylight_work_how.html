<p><a href="https://wiki.tfes.org/images/4/43/Map.png">https://wiki.tfes.org/images/4/43/Map.png</a></p>

<p>How do you keep the perimeter of the flat earth in equal-strength daylight, yet the centre in darkness? <strong>Surely if the perimeter is in daylight, the area it surrounds must be in daylight too?</strong>  How does a single source of light create daylight in a &quot;polo mint&quot; shape, where the edge is light, but the centre dark? </p>

<p>I&#39;ve seen the nonsense animations on YT that do NOT answer the above questions.</p>

<p>I know I know that&#39;s a lot of bible quotes. My point I am making though is that the who ice wall ice shelf thing is a very new teaching when it comes to this very controversial subject. Nowhere in the books does it mention an ice wall. Many many cultures speak about flat earth. </p>

<p>Maybe there is an ice wall maybe there isn&#39;t... I don&#39;t think there is.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So where is Antarctica in your view of the flat earth if there&#39;s no ice wall? What is your map of the world if not this one &gt; <a href="https://wiki.tfes.org/images/4/43/Map.png">https://wiki.tfes.org/images/4/43/Map.png</a> ?</p>

<p>Also, you just replace an ice-wall with &quot;the firmanent&quot; (which looks like a black stone of some sort) which surely circles the flat disc...</p>

<p>How does the flat earth deal with:-</p>

<li>spring and autumn equinoxes (where day and night are in equal balance roughly on all points of the earth)? </li>

<p>It does not deal with any of these in a coherent or logical way, unless of course you look at one of their YouTube proof videos where they don&#39;t actually show you anything that passes as proof, just regurgitates what Dubay has said. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>All the videos I&#39;ve seen never show how the sun lights up the entire perimeter (Antarctica) of the flat earth at the same time - they always show a &quot;spotlight&quot; (tiny sun) moving in all kinds of directions, but obviously one point of light can NOT light up a perimeter of a disc without lighting up its centre too.

    <div class="md"><p>Antarctica is a pretty big place with very few people. I have met at least two people who have been there, one who went to recover bodies from a plane crash and one who went to work at Scott Base for a season. </p>

<p>I know that the further south you go in the Southern summer, the later the sun sets. Hit Antarctica and it doesn&#39;t set for weeks, just like at this time of year in the northern hemisphere, the days are getting longer the further north you go. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>For sure - the winter and summer soltices really highlight the difference between the Arctic and Antarctica in terms of daylight.  So imagine in the FE model, in those many summer months in Antarctica - the entire perimeter of the flat disc is lit up 24/7 month after month after month - while the centre (the Arctic) is in permanent darkness during those months.  All done with one single source of light. </p>

<p>The thing is, the globe reality works better than any of the many flat earth models do. You haven&#39;t explained any of the things that I raised. None of the flat earth models can explain eclipses, lunar or solar or predict them with any degree of accuracy. </p>

<p>No where did I state a refusal to see anything. All the evidence I have seen for a flat earth does not add up, each model requires a lot of extras and added components to explain very simple things to make them work (from a third object that is black and can&#39;t be seen to explain eclipses to convoluted explanations as to why people can&#39;t go to the south pole), with a globe planet, everything that is observed can be explained quite easily and it doesn&#39;t require millions of people being in on the conspiracy. </p>

<p>I have yet to see any compelling arguments for the flat earth that isn&#39;t based in biblical literalism. </p>

<p>I can assure you that all of the flat earth models are wrong. None of them like to talk about the Southern Hemisphere, none of them can account for the orientation of the moon for when viewed north or south of the equator, nor can they explain why South of the equator, the longest day is in December, or the motions of the planets that are visible to the naked eye, or a whole lot of other physical evidence. </p>

<p>Well, I think we&#39;ve established that it&#39;s utterly irrelevant if there&#39;s land, ice or sea water at the north pole. :)</p>

<p>What we DO know is that Arctic and Antarctica have opposite seasons, and opposite daylight/night patterns, yet in the FE model, Antarctica entirely encompasses the Arctic.  And yet, one single source of light can make the circumference light, but the centre dark.  Uh huh.</p>

<p>You also forget that this single source of light (that they calculate to be 30 miles in diameter at a height of 3000 or so miles) speeds up in the Southern summer to cover a greater distance in the same amount of time. </p>

<p>You can see how the Arctic can receive sunlight while the Antarctic isn&#39;t receiving sunlight.</p>

<p>On a flat disc where the Antarctic is the perimeter of the said disc, how can it be that all of the Antarctic is in daylight, but the Arctic isn&#39;t? </p>

<p>No, the axial tilt of the Earth prevents this. When the North Pole is tilted towards the Sun everywhere above the Arctic Circle gets 24 hours of sunlight and everywhere below the Antarctic Circle gets 24 hours of darkness. Vice versa when the South Pole is tilted towards the Sun.</p>
