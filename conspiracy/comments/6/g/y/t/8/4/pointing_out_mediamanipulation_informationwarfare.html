    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s a fact that Trump (and Bill Clinton, for that matter) took multiple rides on Epstein&#39;s plane. It&#39;s a fact that Trump bragged about walking in on undressed underage girls. It&#39;s a fact that Trump regularly brags about how sexy his daughter is. It&#39;s a fact that he ran a scam university and had to settle a lawsuit over it. You may not agree that these are scummy things.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree that Trump is terrible, but again, these are mostly subjective statements that you&#39;re trying to pass as facts. Ex:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&quot;Regularly,&quot; &quot;brags,&quot; &quot;sexy.&quot;&#39;All subjective statements. In other words, it&#39;s your opinion.</p>

<p>As for being incompetent, he&#39;s president of the United States and by all indications he&#39;s had a successful career. Be careful of attribution bias. </p>

<p>Perhaps I should have been more explicit: Trump has bragged about his daughter&#39;s body on multiple occasions.</p>

<p>It&#39;s also funny that you completely ignore Trump&#39;s vacations with Epstein and Trump&#39;s bragging about walking in on underage girls to get pedantic about the exact number of times Trump has bragged about Ivanka&#39;s body.</p>

<p>You think Trump is scummy. That&#39;s fine. I would probably describe him as indecent. I don&#39;t know him well enough to say he&#39;s &quot;scummy.&quot;</p>

<p>Why do you respond this way? Do you also find yourself sexually attracted to young girls in an uncomfortable way? Do you defend all indecent old men, or just Trump?

It&#39;s also up for debate as to how much of an impact it will have on us in the near future, and how that will change depending on our actions. </p>

<p>This is a very emotionally-held issue for a lot of people because we&#39;ve been indoctrinated from a young age with Captain Planet and the recycling movement and a large amount of propaganda. The genius is that nobody can argue AGAINST recycling and reducing waste because its obviously a good practice, so it&#39;s hard to fight environmental regulations, even unfair/unnecessary ones. And regulations are always used as a way to control industries and allow for more corruption, so there&#39;s the economic incentive for the people with power to push the idea that man is largely responsible for climate change. </p>

<p>So what&#39;s the debate?</p>

<p>Wat. How do regulations allow for more corruption? Regulations make sure there isn&#39;t any oil in your drinking water. Regulations take away corruption from the big oil/nuclear power/fracking etc. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Some people believe the data can be interpreted as incontrovertible proof that climate change is primarily man-made, whereas skeptics believe the data allows for many different scenarios in which man has varying degrees of impact.</p>

<p>If our system were free of corruption, then regulations would be great. But I think everyone can agree on the fact that our system is <em>not</em> free of corruption, and the lobbying industry is proof enough of that. Because of these lobbyists, any regulations that are enacted tend to benefit the people with the most wealth/power, not the common man. In order to get the common man behind such regulations, they base them on issues that are hard to argue against, climate change being but one example. </p>

<p>Like what?</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>So what pro-environment regulations have been pushed that go against the belief of the &quot;common man&quot; and benefit the wealthy? </p>

<p>All I have ever seen is the big oil/food processing companies lobbying for less environmental regulations so they can do business in a way that is more damaging to our environment but more profitable.</p>

<p>The people with the most wealth/power benefit from being allowed to damage that environment than protect it, no?</p>

<p>That is the stereotype that has been ingrained in us for a long while, yes. And up until the past few years I made the exact same argument you are making, so I completely get where you&#39;re coming from. The thing about regulations is this: in a corrupt system, they only serve to benefit the corrupt. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>So what pro-environment regulations have been pushed that go against the belief of the &quot;common man&quot; and benefit the wealthy?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You&#39;re not understanding me. I&#39;m not saying the regulations are to the detriment of the common man - I&#39;m sure many of them are helpful to a certain degree - but rather that they are used to give advantages to the folks who have manipulated their way to the top. Mo&#39; regulations - mo&#39; problems.</p>

<p>Most scientists believe that the climate would be changing whether humans were here or not, and again, the argument is based on how much of an impact we actually have, but the &quot;save the planet!&quot; issue has a lot of power to garner public support for regulations. Because of this power, and the fact that those in charge want us to hate ourselves and each other, they&#39;ve made it a social necessity to believe climate change is our fault and we have to take responsibility for it with government intervention.</p>

<p>I literally just explained it to you. Let&#39;s look at the Paris agreement, for example - it would have heavily regulated the US whereas China would be largely unaffected. The issue is just being used as a tool to consolidate/control power, and is about a lot more than saving the planet.</p>

<p>This is not true. The Paris agreement gave each state an independent control of it&#39;s own climate commitments. From what I understand, the pact isn&#39;t binding much at all and countries can do whatever they want. </p>

<p>My fault, I misinterpreted your point. It seemed like you were using that point to make the claim that most scientists are divided on the fact that humans have drastically affected and increased the rate of climate change.</p>

<p>First off, I googled Richard Lindzen and as a fellow r/conspiracy browser, I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll enjoy this: <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jun/13/peabody-energy-coal-mining-climate-change-denial-funding">https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jun/13/peabody-energy-coal-mining-climate-change-denial-funding</a></p>

<p>But like, come on man, at :20 in the video, there&#39;s a graph titled &quot;climate change over time&quot; and it&#39;s from 1997 to 2016 as if that&#39;s an accurate range of measurement. But that graph also actually shows an upward trend in the last three or four years anyways but whatever. </p>

<p>The channel this video on has other videos with titles such as &quot;Why the Right is Right.&quot; </p>

<p>This is a dispute fabricated by big oil money and lobbyists to try and override scientific consensus. </p>

<p>You&#39;re either obtuse or ignorant.

<p>The issue is about the forged &quot;consensus&quot;, the obvious use of propaganda and scare tactics, the weaponization of science and the estimated 37 TRILLION dollars we need to transfer from public to private hands.</p>

<p>I know for a fact that it&#39;s hotter now then when I was a kid because there is no longer ice on the bays where I live. I&#39;m sure that human co2 emissions have an effect. </p>

<p>I believe you have just demonstrated that it will not.</p>

<p>BTW you might want to read the articles you linked.</p>

<p><em>Of the $6 trillion we will spend a year on infrastructure, only a small amount—around $270 billion per year—is needed to accelerate the shift to a low-carbon economy, through clean energy, public transport systems and smarter land use,”</em></p>

<p><em>Switching from fossil fuels to low-carbon sources of energy will cost $44 trillion between now and 2050, according to a report released this week by the International Energy Agency. That sounds like a lot of money, but the report also concludes that the switch to low-carbon technologies such as solar power—together with anticipated improvements in efficiency—will bring huge savings from reduced fossil-fuel consumption. As a result, the world actually comes out slightly ahead: the costs of switching will be paid for in fuel savings between now and 2050.</em></p>

    <div class="md"><p>So sea ice is defined as the ice on the surface of the ocean. From the article: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>A warming climate changes weather patterns, said Walt Meier, a research scientist at Goddard. Sometimes those weather patterns will bring cooler air to some areas. And in the Antarctic, where sea ice circles the continent and covers such a large area, it doesn’t take that much additional ice extent to set a new record.
“Part of it is just the geography and geometry. With no northern barrier around the whole perimeter of the ice, the ice can easily expand if conditions are favorable,” he said.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The article also states that sea ice in the arctic has been losing 20,800 square miles of ice since 1979 while the antarctic has been gaining 7,300 square miles of ice. That means the Earth has been <em>losing</em> an average of 13,500 square miles of sea ice a year since 1979. This is pretty solid evidence of global climate change, refuting your claim. </p>

<p>We should be protecting our natural habitats and creating more natural preserves instead of wasting our time and money on useless and costly CO2 regulation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>One of the biggest threats for animals right now is habitat loss, driven largely by global warming. You can&#39;t just stop habitat loss with money. If we continue our current consumptive path, more species of animals (sensitive to change, like amphibians) will go extinct. This is already happening.</p>

<p>Also, the developing world is trying somewhat to limit emissions. Places like Costa Rica are even ahead of the developed world. China is building green cities and India just invested in some 4 solar energy plants. Also, money from the Paris agreement goes to the Green Climate Fund which funds projects that help millions of people in these countries, while also promoting more environmentally conscious actions.</p>

<p>Saying we shouldn&#39;t even try to stop global warming because of the developing world is just a cop out, based off feelings and not evidence.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not driven by global fucking warming, it&#39;s driven by <em>human development encroaching into natural habitat.</em> That is the biggest problem facing species diversity - being crowded out by human habitation. </p>

<p>You people will literally say any problem is global warming. More hurricanes? Global Warming. Fewer hurricanes? Global warming. Hot temps? Global Warming. Cool temps? Global warming. To the true believer, Global Warming<sup>TM</sup> is the cause of literally every environmental problem. </p>

<p>Oh wow, it&#39;s fucking nothing. China builds a new coal power plant every week. China has some of the worst air pollution in the history of mankind <em>right now</em> in its largest cities, and guess what? Speaking of China, some of the most critically endangered plants animals on the planet are going extinct because of the &quot;medicinal&quot; practices in China. It has very very little to do with CO2. Oh but, hey, they&#39;re building Green<sup>TM</sup> Cities!!! We can subsidize their energy development by supplying them with Solar Panels from our Green Climate Fund<sup>TM</sup> courtesy of the US taxpayer!! And feel good about ourselves for &quot;helping&quot; =]] =]]</p>

</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s not about creation or destruction, nor is it about whether everything is or isn&#39;t a chemical, it&#39;s about <em>change</em>. In burning fossil fuels we generate a chemical reaction that would not have otherwise happened - that&#39;s how we create energy. The cumulative effect of lots of these reactions causes additional changes in the natural world - an increase in the quantity of CO2 and other gases. This accumulation has a set of properties that causes further change - it traps heat and warms the planet.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So we blindly believe OPEC and its unbiased propositions? Come on, the government is much more of a tool for oil companies to curb energy innovation by competitors than listen to science. It&#39;s much more likely that &quot;tried and true corp.&quot; used government enough to stall alternative energies until it could garner the tech and legal to seize and control it, securing its competitive advantage. For one, all you get is talk about climate change. Where&#39;s the real power? In legislation, and it never favors climate change...think about that. So who does it favor? I wonder if those same corporate giants happen to fund a lot of anti-climate change disinfo nonsense to muddy the waters and plant seeds of doubt in those not really up to date on the science but not stupid either, hmm? Don&#39;t worry though, we&#39;ll transition in energy conspumtion. We have to. We know it, they know it...its just about timing.

    <div class="md"><p>A carbon tax could be great in theory but I would like to see the evidence that it would be a valid deterrent. I don&#39;t really think taxes on sodas or cigarettes has proven to be much of a deterrent. Widespread information campaigns about the dangers of drinking to much soda and smoking are the main reason both are declining not the price. I could be wrong though. When something is addictive it is usually able to overcome price barriers like that. Fossil fuels are the most addictive resource on the planet. </p>

<p>There also needs to be transparency on how that tax money is spent. In my cynical mind, I could just see it being funneled into the coffers of the politicians and corporations that back it. Very little of it will probably be reinvested in order to come up with new renewable energy sources. Maybe it is learned helplessness but we always seem to get screwed over.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>what i don&#39;t get is why any conspiracist would champion a suppposed conspiracy that only hurts the petro-feul, petro-dollar cabal which is (1) why we are destroying the ME as the step-and-fetchits of SA and (2) actively waging war against citizens that want to break the power companies&#39; monopolies. </p>

<p>in FL, we just barely beat an FPL trojan horse prop that would have forced those of us with solar panels to pay FPL a solar usage fee every month. some of those NO votes were surely from people who think climate change is bullshit, because the presidential race was almost half and half, but the NOs were 55%.</p>

<p>most conspiracies always boil down to the those with power and money entrenching their power and money against us. big petroleum ain&#39;t the freind of the common man. and they are winning the fight against the climate change believers. it&#39;s exactly like the battle against big tabacco. </p>

<p>i also don&#39;t get why it makes a difference if who is right about climate. the worst case scenario is that you have less exhaust in the air you breathe. i&#39;ll take their bet that exhaust from cars is benign, go lock youself in your garage and turn your car on.  I&#39;ll take their bet that crude oil spilling into water or land is benign, go dig up the soil and fertilize your yard with it or drink a cup of oil filled stream water. i&#39;ll take their bet that fracking is benign, go run your tap and set it on fire. </p>

<p>if they argue they aren&#39;t  arguing that, they come off as idiots because the only result of their &quot;winning&quot; is more oil in the environment, at least until we start feeling the effects of peak oil.</p>

<p>climate change has become the new diest/atheist argument. no one is going to yeild, but we can learn from it because nothing has ever stoped them uniting in disasters to help as many people as they can. it doesn&#39;t matter if one side does it because of christian charity and the other does it because they think it&#39;s the decenct thing to do.</p>

<p>it baffles me tbh</p>

    <div class="md"><p>According to that, the health effects aren&#39;t even very serious until you get into CO2 levels that are more than 15x the normal amount found in the atmosphere at any given moment.</p>

<p>In order to reach those levels you would have to be inside a building that has horrible air circulation and is poorly designed so it traps CO2. You are not going to find those levels of CO2 out in the normal atmosphere as &quot;pollution&quot; from factories or something like that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I see this issue the same way you do.  I consider myself an environmentalist.  I want us to go around planting permaculture food forest as foreign policy and consider myself an eco-Utopianist.  I don&#39;t believe in climate change alarmism and that is what broke the camels back for me and turned me into a skeptic.  CO2 is not actually a pollutant- it&#39;s what forests eat.  All living things depend on the carbon cycle.  Meanwhile climate change alarmism only focuses on one element in a ppm in the atmosphere and declares: this number is &quot;safe&quot; &amp; this number means certain doom for humanity.  </p>

<p>Meanwhile we&#39;ve got studies saying stuff like &quot;climate change&quot; is causing the Great Lakes have a problem with algae blooms with NO mention of stopping pollution at the source from industrial, agricultural &amp; chemical runoff...  which used to be the cause of problems.  But now the culprit is CO2 with NO mention of any other known pollutant.  </p>

<p>And we are simultaneously deforesting the entire equator for profit and leaving nothing behind.  How is that helping?  It&#39;s all hogwash.  Then I learned that they wanted to create a carbon trading scheme  &amp; Lloyd Blankfien&#39;s first tweet was to chastise Trump for pulling out of the worthless piece of paper that is the Paris agreement and I knew exactly what this was about.  </p>

<p>At night, a person on a the street sees different street lights than a person on the same street 1 mile away. In the FE model, the stars in the sky are nowhere near as far a we have been told.</p>

<p>But I did when I sent you an image of the model. <a href="https://youtu.be/gseNeL_Rung?t=244">Here it is as an animation</a></p>

<p>Your theory requires &#39;belief&#39; mine is based on disbelief in the accepted model. You believe your theory because of second hand knowledge. Tell me, when did you start believing the earth is a spinning ball with people walking around an all sides? Did you have evidence or did you just accept the belief? Like a religion. The religion of Scientism.</p>

<p>No it doesn&#39;t. It requires calculations and even you can calculate it. I already questioned all this a long time ago but understanding about space, stars and planets, all the calculations are there and have been for a long time. </p>

<p>You&#39;re not going to be able to persuade me of the hypothetical, propoganda-esk, flat earth theory. There are more holes in the theory than the Earth being a globular type shape. Let&#39;s just leave it there. I&#39;m sorry if I offend your religious beliefs.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Engaging is funny though. You can start telling alt accounts because of the timing of replies. So while people are engaging the shrills, it&#39;s causing the shills to not be able to properly derail topics (more so if it&#39;s their topic or an older one.) Other big thing to notice them is the amount of hyperlinks to &#39;back up&#39; their statements (as though they have a speadsheet open with all the details, ready to counter post.) You can always tell if they don&#39;t have the info at hand since they go silent for a while, until they are able to find &#39;evidence&#39; to back up their fake point.

<p>Was it media manipulation when he attacked a Gold Star Family on national television? Made fun of the disabled? How about his talking shit about his own Intel agencies? Shoved the PM of another country? Acts like a high school girl on Twitter? What about bringing up Rosie O&#39;Donnell during a presidential debate? </p>

<p>I&#39;d argue the opposite when a sub is being taken over like this one.  Right now the shills have enough &quot;posters&quot; to take over the comments section and upvote what they choose.  Not enough real posters take the time to delve into the comments section, they just upvote articles based off the title and move on. </p>

<p>It&#39;d be way easier to get a bot-farm to upvote articles than to automatically vet comments.</p>

<p>I would argue that the pro-trump bot farm (as seen on T_D, and proven when they couldn&#39;t even get a petition to match 1/5 the size of their userbase) is upvoting the articles and the comments are natural.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I disagree with Trumps policies and I would actually be happy if he was impeached. We are in an important time in human history and we need a more capable leader. With that being sad, you and your radicalized anti-trump buddies are just as guilty as Trump cultists in terms of bringing this country down farther into this shit hole. The fact that you can call a human being who seems to be a good father to his kids and has not been charged with any crimes gutter trash is embarrassing. You need to learn some compassion and empathy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am and forever will be a Bernie Democrat, who&#39;s campaign was the embodiment of the compassion and empathy needed in this country. He was robbed by pro-corporate neoliberals, and now the country is under the control of Ayn Rand right-wing authoritarian cultists that represent the latest closest existential threat to the US we all once knew. We could be one Marshall law away from a narcissist tyrant pulling a Turkey on our country. </p>

<p>I do 100% agree with you that we are starving for a more capable leader that can unite people on the left and the right under the common cause of well-being for the majority of Americans, versus the current subjugation of the middle and lower classes by wealthy sociopaths in power controlling both parties.</p>

<p>We all need to rise up against this common enemy, but I agree that we are reaching extreme levels of division fomented by media propaganda on both sides.  </p>

<p>So is closing yourself off to the idea that it is fabricated! :D  But yes, it is good to be good to your surroundings. I have a smart car because I&#39;m poor but I still want to lessen my impact, not to mention my own garden, and hopefully some chickens, soon. Am I certain that some shadowy group is poisoning my food and destroying the world with carbon emissions? Nah. Do I try to do my best in a world of uncertainty? Yeah. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>A carbon tax could be great in theory but I would like to see the evidence that it would be a valid deterrent. I don&#39;t really think taxes on sodas or cigarettes has proven to be much of a deterrent. Widespread information campaigns about the dangers of drinking to much soda and smoking are the main reason both are declining not the price. I could be wrong though. When something is addictive it is usually able to overcome price barriers like that. Fossil fuels are the most addictive resource on the planet. </p>

<p>There also needs to be transparency on how that tax money is spent. In my cynical mind, I could just see it being funneled into the coffers of the politicians and corporations that back it. Very little of it will probably be reinvested in order to come up with new renewable energy sources. Maybe it is learned helplessness but we always seem to get screwed over.</p>
