<p>The memo that was leaked, was leaked on May 11th</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/11/us/politics/trump-comey-firing.html?_r=0">https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/11/us/politics/trump-comey-firing.html?_r=0</a></p>

<p>The Trump tweets about the tapes, didn&#39;t happen until May 12th</p>

<p><a href="http://www.cnn.com/2017/05/12/politics/donald-trump-james-comey-threat/index.html">http://www.cnn.com/2017/05/12/politics/donald-trump-james-comey-threat/index.html</a></p>

<p>So using the facts and CNN which some people only trust.... it seems that if Comey lied about this, what else did he lie about?</p>

<p>There&#39;s no mention of a memo or that Comey kept accounts of his meetings in the article from the 11th, just that things were heard and told.  Trump tweets his threat on the 12th, Comey realizes the tapes would corroborate his memos, then has a friend both showcase the existence of the memos and read from an actual memo on the 16th(or 15th, not sure).  Comey&#39;s given timeline can be seen to work out and explained.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>James Comey is truly a piece of work. The Making of the Pres... Roger Stone Best Price: $14.49 Buy New $13.59</p>

<p>This wasn’t the first time he had given a pass to the Clintons. In the mid-1990’s, Comey joined the Senate Whitewater Committee as deputy director. The Clintons’ were being investigated for fraud in connection with a real estate deal. The Clintons’ were given a pass while two of their closest friends and business partners, Jim and Susan McDougal along with Arkansas Governor Jim Tucker were convicted and received prison time. Jim McDougal died in jail because he was denied the medication he needed to survive.</p>

<p>No one made money on Whitewater except for Bill Clinton who grabbed $850,000 to finance the closing TV blitz that put Clinton back in the Governor’s mansion after Bill’s earlier hubris had ended in his surprise defeat for re-election. Bill escaped charges thanks to Mr. Comey.</p>

<p>In 2002, as a federal prosecutor, Comey took over an investigation into President Bill Clinton’s 2001 pardon of financier Marc Rich who was on the lam. Rich was a former hedge-fund manager who had been indicted on multiple counts of tax evasion, wire fraud, and racketeering. Rich, at the time of the pardon was an international fugitive who fled to Switzerland.</p>

<p>Astoundingly James Comey was the prosecutor in the case against Rich. Then in 2002, he took over the investigation of Clinton’s pardon of the same fugitive. After Rich’s wife contributed $450,000 to the Clinton library fund and $70,000 to Hillary’s Senate campaign the wheels were greased enough to get the pardon put before President Clinton without going through the DOJ review process. After Rich kicked in another million dollars, the pardon was set.</p>

<p>Comey is also assigned to the Sandy Berger case. Berger, who served as Clinton’s National Security Advisor, stole documents that showed Clinton could have killed Osama Bin Laden before 9/11 but didn’t. The corpulent Berger got caught stuffing the documents down his ample pants. Berger, of course, was not charged with DOJ’s James Comey investigating the case.</p>

<p>In 2005, Comey joined Lockheed Martin as senior vice president and general counsel. Lockheed Martin is the world’s biggest government defense contractor in global aerospace, defense, and security raking in $36.2 billion in 2015. Lockheed has also committed more fraud than any other contractor. In the five years that James Comey acted as Lockheed’s general counsel and senior vice president, Lockheed had been caught in these cases.</p>

<p>In January 2005, Lockheed Martin Missiles and Fire Control agreed to pay $1.4 million to resolve allegations of falsely charging the U.S. Army in connection with its production and support contracts for the Multiple Launch The Clintons&#39; War on W... Roger Stone, Robert Mo... Best Price: $3.68 Buy New $7.30 Rocket System.</p>

<p>In 2007, Lockheed agreed to repay the federal government $265 million plus interest in connection with overbilling for work on the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. The company called the overbilling “inadvertent.”</p>

<p>A February 2008 U.S. Government Accountability Office report singled out Lockheed’s F-22A fighter plane in a review of weapons systems plagued by large cost overruns, delays and quality problems. (The following year the Senate voted to terminate the F-22 program).</p>

<p>In June 2008, the Project on Government Oversight made public a 2007 report by the Defense Contract Management Agency that found Lockheed failed to follow 19 of 32 Pentagon guidelines on tracking and managing costs on major weapons programs.</p>

<p>In August 2008, Lockheed agreed to pay $4 million to settle charges that it failed to get permission to sell missiles to the United Arab Emirates and that the company revealed classified information during negotiations with the Persian Gulf nation.</p>

<p>In 2009, the Pentagon said that Lockheed would have to pay part of the huge cost overruns on the delay-ridden F-35 fighter jet project. In December 2010, Lockheed agreed to pay $10.28 million to resolve federal charges that it overbilled the Air Force and the Navy for the C-27J tactical aircraft.</p>

<p>Comey was paid $6 million in one year alone from Lockheed. Comey left Lockheed in 2010 but not before convincing Lockheed to become a Clinton Foundation donor and a Clinton Global Initiative member. In 2010, Lockheed won 17 approvals for private contracts from Hillary Clinton’s State Department.</p>

<p>Now, incredibly we learn that Comey let Hillary off the hook after consuming intel that indicated that Attorney General Loretta Lynch had assured the Clinton campaign that she would contain the probe. This “intel” turned out to be a forgery although who produced the forgery is unknown. But it purports to show a clear act of obstruction by Mr. Comey.</p>

<p>Let’s let the Washington Post take it from there;</p>

<p>“Current and former officials have argued that the secret document gave Comey good reason to take the extraordinary step over the summer of announcing the findings of the Clinton investigation himself without Justice The Man Who Killed Ken... Roger Stone Department involvement……..”</p>

<p>“Comey had little choice, these people have said, because he feared that if Lynch announced no charges against Clinton, and then the secret document leaked, the legitimacy of the entire case would be questioned………”</p>

<p>“Then on July 5th Comey decided to announce on his own — without telling Lynch ahead of time — that he was closing the Clinton email case without recommending charges against anyone. Aides to Comey said he decided to act alone after Lynch met privately with Bill Clinton for nearly a half-hour on an airport tarmac in Phoenix about a week earlier — and have since said privately the Russian document was also a factor in that decision………”</p>

<p>The secret intelligence document has attracted so much attention recently that Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa) asked Comey about it during the director’s final public appearance in Congress as FBI director before he was fired.</p>

<p>Comey said that he had spoken with the heads of the congressional intelligence committees about the document privately but that it was too sensitive to discuss it in public. “The subject is classified, and in an appropriate forum I’d be happy to brief you on it,” he told the Senate Judiciary Committee. “But I can’t do it in an open hearing,“ the former FBI Director said.</p>

<p>In 2013 James Comey became a board member, a director and a Financial System Vulnerabilities Committee member of the London bank HSBC Holdings. HSBC is noted as the world’s most corrupt bank. In 2012, HSBC was fined a mere $1.9 billion for laundering drug money and violating U.S. sanctions against Iran. Yet no one went to jail for this drug-related mega-crime. The $1.9 billion fine was sold by Comey to Loretta Lynch our Attorney General. Lynch used the “deferred prosecutions” under which criminal charges against a firm are set aside in lieu of a fine.</p>

<p>So less than one year after HSBC pays the $1.9 billion fine, and HSBC Execs avoid serious jail time and after HSBC is found to be the most corrupt bank in the world, James Comey joins the board of directors at the recommendation of Barack Obama. How much was he paid for helping the HSBC criminals avoid jail? What were his “board fees’?</p>

<p>In less than a year after that, Comey was tapped by Obama to head the FBI. President Trump was wise to fire this nut job.</p>

<p>But, now that Comey has fucked himself under oath, apparently the info that could only be known to two people, one of which is denying it, got into the media by some magical means.</p>

<p>No. The only place that info exists is in Comey&#39;s mind. He transferred it to writing at some point and transferred that info to the NYT 1 day before the tweet. The leak caused the tweet from Trump.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Memo is info put on paper; but it also made it to the newspaper, a day before the tweet. There were only two people present according to the report: Trump and Comey. </p>

<p>Trump sees Comey has been discussing their one-on-one convos and sends out a tweet the following morning: </p>

<p>&quot;James Comey better hope there are no &quot;tapes&quot; of our conversation before he starts leaking to the press.</p>

<p>Not you, but certainly some have had difficulty with this concept:</p>

<p>There were only Trump and Comey present. If Trump didn&#39;t leak it, Comey did. Comey lied under oath (perjury) by saying he only leaked the info after the tweet.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So how do you reckon that the info was given to the paper a day before the tweet? </p>

<p>The info in the memo largely focused on Trump asking Comey to end the investigation into Flynn. The article OP posted does not include that information at all. I haven&#39;t been able to find that information published anywhere before May 16th. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>And?</p>

<p>The only place the info in the above article exists is from Comey. There is no other source. Comey is the source at he meeting, alleging he made memos and they said that Trump demanded loyalty and the only place the NYTs could have gotten that info. And they got it and published the article on May 11th.</p>

<p>Trump sent the tweet May 12th. Comey stated that he made the leak in response to Trump&#39;s tweet. </p>

<p>That is a provable lie made under oath.</p>

<p>Comey stated that he hadn&#39;t even told the AG this, nor anyone else that could be brought up to speak about it. He, it seems, only told those those who got it into print. </p>

<p>Trump was looking for leakers. He found one. Now Comey has lied about it under oath. </p>

<p>I also watched the whole testimony. Comey stated it was in response to Trump&#39;s email that he released the info, but it wasn&#39;t: that&#39;s provable by looking at a NYT&#39;s article and a tweet.</p>

<p>Trump has been publicly hunting leakers for a bit. The May 11th leak could only have come through Comey and now Trump can do what he likes with Comey. Comey done fucked up.</p>

<p>Any leak came from Comey and Comey said under oath that he leaked the &quot;content of the memo&quot; only after Trump&#39;s tweet.</p>

<p>Which is that the May 11th article isn&#39;t about classification. Exact same thing people said here. In neither thread was there ever a question of it being a matter of classification. It wasn&#39;t in the OP, in any comments or my comment history.</p>

<p>And yet, in both threads, random users have showed up to try to sidetrack it to being about classification.</p>

<p>Comey said that he released the &quot;content of the memo&quot;, not the memo, after Trump&#39;s tweet. And yet, you get random posters trying to fixate on the word &quot;memo&quot; rather than &quot;content of the memo&quot;. </p>

<p>Then you get users trying to say: </p>

<p>Other&#39;s knew. But of course, there was never really a question of that. As it states, Comey gave them info (&quot;content of the memo&quot;) and it was published on May 11th.</p>

<p>It was this that prompted Trump&#39;s tweet. Comey has tried to turn this on it&#39;s head and said Trump&#39;s tweet prompted him to release &quot;the contents of the memo&quot; through a friend. Well, he certainly released the &quot;contents of the memo&quot; &quot;through a friend&quot; but before Trump&#39;s tweet.</p>

<p>It&#39;s like one of those situations where you see the guy saying he was trying to remove the knife and then video evidence shows he stuck it in before he removed it.</p>

<p>Comey alone could have leaked it and it prompted Trump&#39;s tweet and Comey is a lying sack of shit that just got fucked.</p>

<p>Nope.  The media isn&#39;t the other people I&#39;m referring to.  He told other people in the FBI about the conversations previous to all of this and only after the firing did one of them feel it was ok to leak it.

<p>Where did he say this?  When did he ever say he didn&#39;t tell anyone before the 12th?  He talked to friends privately about it before the 12th and then on the 15th he asked one to go to the press to get the full story out there, rather than just the second hand half truths that had been published on the 11th.

<p>No one is denying that.  Not me.  Not Comey.  Why wouldn&#39;t he talk to his friends and co-workers about a meeting he had with Trump?   Was he told not to?  Was the meeting top secret?  </p>

<p>What he did deny is personally leaking, or authorizing the leaking of information about the Trump and Clinton investigations <em>to the press:</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p>GRASSLEY: And thank you for your opening statement. I’m going to start out probably with a couple subjects you wish I didn’t bring up, and then a third one that I think everybody needs to hear your opinion on on a policy issue. It is frustrating when the FBI refuses to answer this committee’s questions, but leaks relevant information to the media. In other words, they don’t talk to us, but somebody talks to the media.</p>

<p>Director Comey, have you ever been an anonymous source in news reports about matters relating to the Trump investigation or the Clinton investigation?</p>

<p>COMEY: Never.</p>

<p>GRASSLEY: Question two, relatively related, have you ever authorized someone else at the FBI to be an anonymous source in news reports about the Trump investigation or the Clinton investigation?</p>

<p>COMEY: No.</p>

Comey told somebody details of the meeting but didn&#39;t actually leak the physical memo that he wrote to back up what was being said.  He did leak the physical memo after the 12th and that memo was reported on by the NYT in the 16th.  Comey didn&#39;t perjur himself.  The memo wasn&#39;t leaked prior to the 12th.  Some details were divulged prior but the details were not classified so it&#39;s not a leak.</p>

<p>The President told Comey: I need your loyalty.</p>

<p>Only Comey and the President knew this (if it happened). Comey included it in his memos (when? who knows). Comey said under oath that the content of his memos were leaked through a friend all prompted by Trump&#39;s tweet. </p>

<p>The story from May 11th was a leak from Comey about the contents of his memos through friends to the media and caused Trump to tweet.</p>

<p>100% perjury. Nothing to do with Trump&#39;s lawyer&#39;s, nor Baron, or Melania, all to do with what Comey said under oath and what the NYTs printed on the 11th and what Trump tweeted on the 12th.</p>

<p>Three things. I know you&#39;d like it to be something, something Drumpf is Hitler, but it is all concrete, written in stone, verifiable perjury.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This response is confusing. Here is the exchange between Rubio and Comey:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Marco Rubio</p>

<p>THE PRESIDENT&#39;S WISHES WERE KNOWN TO THEM, CERTAINLY BY THE NEXT DAY WHEN HE HAD A PRESS CONFERENCE, THE PRIME MINISTER. GOING BACK, THREATTE THREE REQUESTS WERE, NUMBER ONE, BE LOYAL, NUMBER TWO, LET THE MIKE FLYNN THING GO, HE&#39;S A GOOD GUY, TREATED UNFAIRLY, AND NUMBER THREE, CAN YOU PLEASE TELL THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WHAT THESE LEADERS IN CONGRESS ALREADY KNOW, WHAT YOU ALREADY KNOW, YOU TOLD ME THREE TIMES, THAT I&#39;M NOT UNDER PERSONALLY UNDER INVESTIGATION.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>James B. Comey Jr.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>THOSE ARE THE THREE THINGS HE ASKED, YES, SIR.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So we can see, that at least one item of those three things was the subject of the May 11 NYT article.  The loyalty issue.  This comes before the tweet on May 12. </p>

<p>Further when questioned about the &#39;memo&#39;, here is what we have:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Susan M. Collins</p>

<p>AND TO WHOM DID YOU SHOW COPYS?</p>

<p>James B. Comey Jr.</p>

<p>I ASKED PRESIDENT TWEETED ON FRIDAY AFTER I GOT FIRED THAT I BETTER HOPE THERE IS NOT TAPES. I WOKE UP IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT ON MONDAY NIGHT, BECAUSE IT DIDN&#39;T DAWN ON ME ORIGINALLY, THAT THERE MIGHT BE CORROBORATION FOR OUR CONVERSATION, MIGHT BE A TAPE, MY JUDGMENT WAS I NEEDED TO GET THAT OUT INTO THE PUBLIC SQUARE AND SO I ASKED A FRIEND OF MINE TO SHARE THE CONTENT OF THE MEMO WITH A REPORTER. DIDN&#39;T DO IT MYSELF FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS, BUT ASKED HIM TO, BECAUSE I THOUGHT THAT MIGHT PROMPT THE APPOINTMENT OF A SPECIAL COUNSEL. I ASKED A CLOSE FRIEND OF MINE TO DO THAT.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This has been bothering me all day. It just doesn&#39;t add up that Comey remembered his memos after Trump tweeted about the tapes and then suddenly wanted to make it public with no reason given, just that he was reminded by trump and wanted to make it public (just because, I guess?). It makes no sense for Trump to have preemptively threaten about tapes if nothing had happened. He was clearly reacting to something. And Comey&#39;s motivations are nonsensical. </p>

<p>I guess this explains that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Memo is info put on paper; but it also made it to the newspaper, a day before the tweet. There were only two people present according to the report: Trump and Comey. </p>

<p>Trump sees Comey has been discussing their one-on-one convos and sends out a tweet the following morning: </p>

<p>&quot;James Comey better hope there are no &quot;tapes&quot; of our conversation before he starts leaking to the press.</p>

<p>Not you, but certainly some have had difficulty with this concept:</p>

<p>There were only Trump and Comey present. If Trump didn&#39;t leak it, Comey did. Comey lied under oath (perjury) by saying he only leaked the info after the tweet.</p>
