</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>Voted to free Wall Street from many of the constraints put in place after the 2008 financial crisis, the opening salvo in what is likely to be a protracted battle over deregulation of the powerful banking industry.</p>

<p>Big banks, from Goldman Sachs to Bank of America, would face less scrutiny, and other large financial institutions, such as insurance giant MetLife, could escape tougher rules altogether under the legislation approved largely along party lines.</p>

<p>The Trump administration backed the bill, the Financial Choice Act, as part of a multi-pronged effort to ease banking regulations to spur economic growth.</p>

<p>They [Democrats] noted that banks reported record profits last year, despite tough Dodd-Frank Act rules, and Wall Street bonuses rose for the first time in three years.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>For the same reason so many people support Clinton and the Democratic Party for being constantly fucked over from them as well. </p>

<p>Propaganda. The corporate media tells us that we have to pick one of those two, and if you accept that false dilemma, you&#39;re gonna pick yourself a turd sandwich or a giant douche. They&#39;re two sides of the same coin, and neither is ever going to actually turnt the policies that people actively want, like fixing healthcare so everyone can actually get treatment, ending cannabis prohibition, ending the illegal wars abroad, etc. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>But that&#39;s objectively wrong. Democrats have a long track record of supporting the middle class. The Democrats passed banking regulations. The Democrats expanded Medicade to millions of more people by creating a &quot;luxury tax&quot; on the rich people&#39;s Heath plans. The Democrats fought for net neutrality. The Democrats raised taxes on the rich so they could restore funding for social programs. The Democrats stood up to the oil and gas corporations and forced them to invest in clean energy solutions. The Republicans want to destroy all of that, just so they can give more tax breaks to the richest 1%.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Democrats look out for the little guy instead of the banks? Are you serious? Did you know banks wrote Dodd-Frank? Did you know Dodd-Frank made it so that the next time banks go insolvent due to their own stupidity and derivatives market, they will bail-in all their depositors&#39; monies instead of bailout? Same difference: people lose; banks always win. Please explain how according to Dodd-Frank, if you put your money/savings into the bank, it&#39;s no longer yours but the bank&#39;s money when they go under. How are the Dodd-Frank &quot;banking regulations&quot; a protection for us Americans? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>How am I wrong? Do your own fucking research; it&#39;s not my fault you didn&#39;t read the voluminous bill. Of course they buried this in there and the corporate msm won&#39;t report on it for obvious reasons. But feel free to google it; bail-ins have already happened/happening right now in Europe.</p>
