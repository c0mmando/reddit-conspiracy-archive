       I was following various discussions on the MKULTRA youtube videos and through the deciphering of various coded messages connected to these videos i was lead to Stuart Silverstone
      </p>
      <p>
       This website is definetely connected to all of this but the language being used is hard to pull meaning out of
      </p>

       "Over the past thirty years Stuart has developed tools for integrating architectural and media experiences into visual displays that facilitate collaborative efforts in learning, creativity, problem-solving, decision-making and action - evolving together into 'pattern language' for visual information displays.
His signature visual information design approach is to facilitate understanding by identifying and displaying the key patterns that comprise big-picture overviews of themes, with emphasis on wholism, generalism, alternatives and future visions."
      </p>
      <p>
       I was just reading The Art of Memory by Frances Yates. She writes extensively about something called a "memory theater" used by Renaissance mages. To "bring to light the great trans-cultural experiences ferried across time by the mythic and symbolic imagery contained in the stories of world culture" is, in modern buzzwords, exactly what memory theaters were intended to do.
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giulio_Camillo">
        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giulio_Camillo
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       The purpose of the memory theater is to effect a Platonic anamnesis of occult wisdom in the mind of the adept. If Stuart Silverstone's group is interested in doing this on a large scale, then what it is trying to achieve is the definition of mass mind control: the surreptitious initiation of large numbers of people into their New Age cult.

       I would like to bring forward Freuds Seduction Theory (
       <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freud%27s_seduction_theory%C2%A0">
        https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freud%27s_seduction_theory
       </a>
       )
      </p>
      <p>
       It was a hypothesis posited in the mid-1890s by Sigmund Freud that he believed provided the solution to the problem of the origins of hysteria and obsessional neurosis. According to the theory, a repressed memory of an early childhood sexual abuse or molestation experience was the essential precondition for hysterical or obsessional symptoms, with the addition of an active sexual experience up to the age of eight for the latter.
      </p>
      <p>
       Freud believed early sexual abuse caused neurosis (removed from dictionary of medical terminology in 1980) and hysteria.
      </p>
      <p>
       Freud's seduction theory emphasizes the causative impact of nurture: the shaping of the mind by experience. This theory held that hysteria and obsessional neurosis are caused by repressed memories of infantile sexual abuse
      </p>
      <p>
       Guess what motherfuckers.
      </p>
      <p>
       EVERY PATIENT HE TESTED SHOWED SIGNS OF SEXUAL ABUSE IN INFANCY
      </p>
      <p>
       Freud proposed that adults who experienced sexual abuse as a child suffer from unconscious memories and feelings incompatible with the central mass of thoughts and feelings that constitute his or her experience.
      </p>
      <p>
       he wrote of his â€œsurprise that in all cases, the father, not excluding my own, had to be accused of being perverse" if he were to be able to maintain the theory; and the "realization of the unexpected frequency of hysteriaâ€¦ whereas surely such widespread perversions against children are not very probable."
      </p>
      <p>
       " surely such widespread perversions against children are not very probable"
      </p>
      <p>
       THEY FUCKING ARE PROBABLE.
      </p>
      <p>
       LOOK AT:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The Finders
       </p>
       <p>
        The Catholic Chruch
       </p>
       <p>
        Epstein
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Widespread childhood sexual abuse is being perputated to induce neurosis style mental disorder for an unknown purpose. Freud also stated that being raised by Neurotic parents can pass this illness on.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Unconscious memories of infantile sexual abuse was a necessary condition for the development of certain disorders"
      </p>
      <p>
       This is the new MKULTRA we know for a fact Sexual Abuse was tested for mind control useability. We just didnt know what they discovered

       It will melt your mind if you look into it. Of course no one is but the patternlanguage.com has sections that talk about the human genome, human spirit, healing through building, actually go through the site keeping in mind its supposedly about architecture and buildings. It is a coded website talking about mind control and how it works through coded talk and doublespeak im sure of it.

       I decided to check out "THE CENTER FOR ENVIRONMENTAL STRUCTURE." One of the first links to come up on Google search for that character string was the following.

       A page for a Berkeley Professor who is actually a Professor Emeritus of... that's right... Architecture.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not only that, his bio states the following:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Christopher Alexander is a Professor Emeritus of Architecture at the University of California, Berkeley.
       </p>
       <p>
        He is the father of the Pattern Language movement in computer science, and A Pattern Language, a seminal work that was perhaps the first complete book ever written in hypertext fashion.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Sorry, but I think your assertion that this is anything other than a website about architecture is misguided.
      </p>
      <p>
       I could be wrong, but Occam's Razor wins me over in this case. I'm gonna say the site established by a Professor of architecture and talking about the subject of architecture is probably actually about architecture, and not brain-washing.

       It is not possible, at present, to give a precisely defined way of identifying the sequences which work. That is to say, we do not yet know a mathematical procedure which can identify the sequences which work. However, the sequences which work can be identified , experimentally, by a fairly well defined procedure. If one applies a sequence of steps to a given context, and if one then observes the unfolding process, it is possible to ascertain, unambiguously, whether the process engendered by this sequence at any time contradicts itself. That means, we ask whether one is forced to backtrack, because step B which comes at a certain point in the sequences forces one to undo the results of a previously taken step A.
      </p>
      <p>
       In this way, by doing experiments on test cases, it is possible to winnow out or correct sequences, and essentially to eliminate all the bad ones, thus gradually finding ones way to the good sequences, which have the property that no such backtracking occurs as a project unfolds.
      </p>
      <p>
       This property of being backtrack-free is the essence of what makes a successful sequence.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is very important to note that, for a given set of steps, such a backtrack-free sequence is stable. Once discovered, the property of being backtrack-free stays, and it is true for all contexts. Thus the backtrack-free sequences are the essence of the theory of unfolding. Since the identification of backtrack-free sequences can be made, experimentally, the property is objective and is unambiguously defined by experiment (even though difficult to find, experimentally).

       That's true..and it continues throughout life. They've basically implemented a soft form of the same trauma based mind control perpetrated on select individuals and tailored it to the entire population. It's becoming worse with more individualised targeting now. Using collected data and creating profiles for people allows the methods to be better conformed to a single person.

       My dad was raped a shit ton as a kid, my mom was a ho who blew all the neighbor kids because she had been abused, and I was raped by my preacher as a kid. One thing I've noticed among those who have experienced harsh sexual abuse is that we all have a kid voice that protects us. The chick from Majestic Ape had one (forget the name), my mom's is named frisbee, my dad's is named "Geoff", and mine is named "Dust". It's a weird thing..

      <p>
       It's the dissociative mechanism that defends us from trauma. the phenomenon creates "others" in the psyche that compartmentalise and deal with the abuse while others can go on to function without those constant memories. It's really a miracle that helps an abused kid survive but abusers have also used the presence of dissociation in their victimes to cover their crimes.

       Good post. Very thought out and well-written. If there is one thing I've learned worth mentioning it's that there is a wealth of hidden knowledge purposefully hidden from the masses. I'm speaking in terms of technology, history and geology. If there is one other thing I've learned that's worth mentioning it's that true evil exists and it's naive to think that it is in anyway related to socio-economic status.
