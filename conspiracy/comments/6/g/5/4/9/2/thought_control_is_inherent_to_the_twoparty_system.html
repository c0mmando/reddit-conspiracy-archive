<p>The danger of political parties lies not just in their tendency to raise up immoral leaders. It lies in their tendency to subvert the way the people think about governance into an endless, unwinnable battle of the lesser evil against the greater evil.</p>

<p>On any issue, our thinking is clouded by whether a certain proposal is consistent with Team A or Team B. Even worse, is it consistent with how I IDENTIFY. Once you get into identities, the rational part of your brain is shutting down, and the part responsible for protecting against threats starts lighting up.</p>

<p>Ask yourself abstract questions like: what is the best way to get the economy moving right now? Is it meaningless labels, like &quot;free markets&quot; or &quot;socialism&quot;? </p>

<p>Or is it a concrete change, like investing in an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_ring">Orbital Ring</a>, reducing the cost of accessing space so much that double digit economic growth would result from asteroid mining and deploying solar panels to space to produce electricity for less than a penny per kilowatt hour.</p>

<p>Is it replacing the private Federal Reserve with a system of public credit, like the one that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Bank_of_the_United_States">created</a> the canals, National Road, and Transcontinental Railroad?</p>

<p>Ask yourself, if there are ideas out there that would create double-digit economic growth and free us from the chains of the usury-banking system, why isn&#39;t either party talking about them?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would argue that most often socialism has had promising starts which were quickly crushed by externally funded pressure vis a vis the CIA, and then in the few cases which resisted imperialism i.e. USSR/China Marxist-Leninist ideology won out and resulted in the centralization of capital via the state resulting in a new dictatorship by party elites (really, state capitalism) like you describe. But there are other socialist ideologies and many socialists do not support this sort of state centered approach, so it&#39;s not something inherent to socialism. </p>

<p>I&#39;m just saying that I regularly see posts like this bemoaning the current state of affairs, complaining about media moguls/bankers/industrialists running our political system, essentially complaining about capitalism itself (as it is quite literally the source from which these people derive their power and influence) but then in the same breath they dismiss the obvious alternative (even as they&#39;re describing a need for publicly funded and owned infrastructure which is literally socialism!).</p>

<p>Maybe you&#39;re right and I&#39;m just hung up on labels, but I think many people are just completely misinformed as to what socialism is. Which shouldn&#39;t be a surprise, the oligarchs lie about everything else, of course they&#39;ve been brainwashing people about an ideological system which represents a fundamental threat to their existence. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I feel like your argument just follows the textbook narrative. From what I&#39;ve seen the &#39;deep state&#39; (banks) intentionally set up the Socialist Germany, Socialist Russia, China, etc., to fill the enemy role of the West. There were constantly spies being found who were loyal to the deep state and served to allow for the transfer of technologies, intelligence, flows of cash and weapons, etc. </p>

<p>Where this is most undoubtedly true is with the National Socialist regime of Germany. I don&#39;t have all the links on me but <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/national/daily/nov98/nazicars30.htm">GM, Ford</a>, JP Morgan, the Bush family, the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/68ew02/til_that_the_koch_family_fortune_was_made_in_part/">Koch brothers</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_and_the_Holocaust">IBM</a>, you name it, were all found to be the figures who facilitated Hitler&#39;s rise. If you look at Germany&#39;s history you&#39;ll see they were also the same actors that caused the economic collapse of Germany -- even included in the decision making of Germany&#39;s WWI reparations.</p>

<p>And if you look at Soviet Russia and China you&#39;ll find similar activity. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambridge_Five">Cambridge Five</a> turned out to be way more than just five spies. </p>

<p>Then to get people off this the US government even set up a stage play in Congress with McCarthy and Roy Cohn, who was one of the main guys involved in blackmail and human trafficking at the time, also Trump&#39;s &quot;second father&quot;. These guys pretended to be fighting for America but instead they just made a mess of the case and allowed for the deep state to continue expanding its empire.</p>

<p>And by the way the critiques you listed have nothing to do with capitalism vs socialism. Find me one instance of Karl Marx criticizing the banks.</p>

<p>My argument follows from an accurate reading of history. The &quot;deep state&quot; is just a colloquialism people use (often unknowingly) to refer to the capitalist class as it exerts its will via government agencies. There&#39;s a reason you&#39;ve got people like Smedley Butler testifying that their &quot;service&quot; to the country was really as an enforcer for capital. </p>

<p>Just look at the CIA&#39;s actions around the world, every time a country voted in a socialist government or even one which simply was not friendly to Western capitalist interests- boom, coup d&#39;etat. Guatemala, Chile, Nicaragua, Iran, etc., all over the world for decades. Iraq, Syria, Egypt, Tunisia, Libya, all governed by the remnants of the (not actually socialist) Arab Socialist movement, all ideologically opposed to western capitalism, all freedom&#39;d. </p>

<p>On a side note, how is it that western capitalists funded the Soviet revolution? Because they were also funding the Whites... this is a claim I&#39;ve often seen repeated but never substantiated since the only source I&#39;ve seen is Antony Sutton and he makes pretty ridiculous claims like &quot;there is no such thing as Soviet technology.&quot;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Nazi Germany is <em>not fucking Socialist</em>. They used Marxist rhetoric to appeal to the petite bourgeoisie and working class to draw support which would have otherwise gone to the German Communists, but all their radical party planks came from the Strasserists who actually were to the left but who were also all purged in the Night of the Long Knives. Nazi Germany is actually notably one of the first examples of modern privatization as the government sold off numerous assets and public services. Now, why would western capitalists support a government actively engaging in such a privatization spree? I wonder...</p>

<p>Just pointing out that you are describing political pressure and influence being levied by the capitalist class.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And by the way the critiques you listed have nothing to do with capitalism vs socialism. Find me one instance of Karl Marx criticizing the banks.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The problems with society which people keep mentioning arise as a natural consequence of private ownership of capital. It&#39;s literally capitalism vs socialism. Bankers have no power with no private banks. Media moguls cannot swing elections with propaganda without privately owned media. There cannot be a military industrial complex without private ownership of industry. The whole idea of socialism is to democratize society by preventing the ownership of capital and the inevitable political influence that brings. </p>

<p>But too many people are too scared of socialism without questioning the decades of propaganda fed to them by a capitalist ruling class, and too few people even know what socialism is. I&#39;m sure you&#39;re going to read this and think I&#39;m talking about big government owning everything, because everyone seems to think Stalinism is the only school of thought there is. </p>

<p>Just remember when you go to work that there&#39;s a whole class of people who love like kings, never doing any real work, subsidized by the stolen value of your labor- the source of all profit- and on top of that they by their wealth make almost all political decisions for you. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I used to be a socialist until I fully understood what Alexander Hamilton and George Washington wanted and it&#39;s not the capitalism we have today.

America was created to overthrow this imperialist mindset and become a &quot;city on a hill&quot; but was subverted.</p>

<p>The goal of capitalism is to just increase the prosperity of the country. It encourages a creation of capital, so there are enough resources for anyone capable of voting.

If they actually wanted capital they would unleash all the technological advancements they prevent from realizing.</p>

<p>What made FDR a great president is that he really went after infrastructure and made intentional breaks with the imperialist powers (he created brazil&#39;s steel industry, helped iran and mexico start up their oil businesses, all of which was later screwed up).

<p>It defies belief that one could be in any measure of the word a socialist and then fall prey to such delusion. Capitalism has no goal. You&#39;re anthropomorphizing it, deifying it in some weird way where it has some sort of intention or desired effect. It&#39;s merely a system of ownership. That&#39;s it. This system of ownership has undeniable effects on our society long term, and in itself incentivizes the very perversion of itself which you describe. Capitalism is driven towards profit. &quot;Crony&quot; capitalism is profitable. There will always be incentive for it, and just looking at history should tell you what tends to happen. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>What made FDR a great president</p>

<p>I would argue that what made him a great president were the strides made for worker&#39;s rights, environmental protections, publicly funded and owned infrastructure programs, etc., all of which <em>curtailed</em> the effects of capitalism gone rampant. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>It doesn&#39;t matter if you call yourself socialist or capitalist, as long as you establish a mechanism that encourage people to be productive.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You could make the same argument in defense of slavery, as long as it&#39;s &quot;productive&quot; enough, and that&#39;s how most socialists view wage labor under the capitalist system. My favorite quote on this is from Peter Kropotkin, a well regarded anarcho-socialist: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;We cry shame on the feudal baron who forbade the peasant to turn a clod of earth unless he surrendered to his lord a fourth of his crop. We called those the barbarous times. But if the forms have changed, the relations have remained the same, and the worker is forced, under the name of free contract, to accept feudal obligations. For, turn where he will, he can find no better conditions. Everything has become private property, and he must accept, or die of hunger.&quot;
-Peter Kropotkin</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If there is no means by which one may acquire private property, meaning capital, without working in servitude towards someone who already owns capital, meaning a capitalist, how is that any less a form of slavery? How is it any better than indentured servitude? Can you truly be free if there is no alternative to renting yourself to enrich another? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Problem with socialism is it encourages people to violently rebel and the banks always take the opportunity to capture the state apparatus during these situations.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think you misunderstand. Socialists believe that the people should own and control the means of production. There are many forms in which this may take, one of which I am inclined to support is anarcho-syndicalism, many of which are very different to what I assume your idea of socialism is. The general idea is that true democracy is impossible in a capitalist system as private ownership of capital inevitably translates to private ownership of power, which then inevitably has political influence. But again, supporting socialism doesn&#39;t necessarily mean whatever your view of it is as there are many schools of thought as to how to implement it. Nobody is saying &quot;to defeat evil we have to come and take your houses away,&quot; you know? A lot of people have that misconception. </p>

<p>We currently live in a system where a privileged few, through their near complete monopolization of private property and the means of production (as well as media ownership), not only reap the majority of the benefits from the labor of the working class but also exert their influence- which only exists as a result of their ownership of capital- on political systems across the globe in order to further their profits and capital accumulation at great expense to both the environment and the working class. Every single day there are posts here about GLOBALISTS or THE CABAL or (((THIS STUPID DOG WHISTLE))) and they are <em>always</em> complaining about something which is an inevitable result from our system of ownership and profit incentive. </p>

<p>So here&#39;s your post literally mentioning the need for freedom from the &quot;chains of the usury banking system,&quot; the need for publicly funded and owned infrastructure like a space elevator (tell me, do you think it would be more beneficial to humanity of Elon Musk owned it, or the world?), and the damage the two party system (which in its current form exists to support the oligarchy) causes to the political process. You&#39;re describing issues that arise from the private ownership of capitalism. You&#39;re describing solutions which involve public ownership of capital.</p>

<p>It&#39;s literally capitalism vs socialism. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>Would you say this if I were advocating for a transition from a feudal mode of production towards a capitalist democracy? If your king is shit, and all your problems stem from your shitty king, I&#39;d think viewing the end of his rule as a necessity in solving these issues would be a pretty appropriate viewpoint. </p>

<p>Really? American citizens chose to buy foreign rather than domestic products, and to ignore the mountains of evidence that could put countless officials in prison. We freely created our future (if you consider the actions of the brainwashed free).</p>

<p>Attaching a label just defeats the purpose. If you can think of tangible actions that can make people&#39;s lives better, comment about those rather than some useless label that everyone interprets differently. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Is it a free choice when there are no alternatives? Why would workers with ever-higher rent and stagnant wages spend more of their limited income on domestic goods when foreign goods come at a tenth of the price and twice the profit margin for the capital which controlled its production? Especially when there are numerous tricks used to give the <em>appearance</em> of domestic production, such as KitchenAid&#39;s products which proudly label themselves Made in America but note underneath that they&#39;re <em>assembled</em> here. </p>

<p>Like, you&#39;re expecting consumers to have perfect knowledge and apply that knowledge to consume intelligently- a very libertarian worldview- when people simply do not function that way. Nobody has the time to become informed on the web of product and brand ownership necessary to &quot;vote with their dollars&quot; in a conscious and effective way, and not only that but corporate America is constantly using its understanding of psychology and marketing to spur and manipulate that consumption on a grand scale. </p>

<p>I&#39;d love it if people would just stop buying goods produced by literal slaves or shopping at Walmart or whatever, but in reality people are going to go to the most convenient store on their few hours off work and grab whatever the most affordable version of their desired product is. Maybe you don&#39;t, but I guarantee you there is no more thought process than that for the majority of people. And the people running these corporations are aware of this.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Again, capitalists control the media, capitalists in the media have a vested interest in running interference for the corrupt officials which assist their business goals... people didn&#39;t just &quot;choose to be brainwashed,&quot; the media has <em>actively engaged in this</em>. And what are those who are &quot;awake&quot; to do? Protest and be painted as nuts i.e. Occupy Wallstreet? Rebel and be painted as nuts and also murdered by the police or thrown in jail? These are the two realistic realities here, and it&#39;s bourgeois ownership of the media which facilitates this. </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Is feudalism a useless label? Is capitalism a useless label? Monarchy? Democracy? These terms are descriptors for various ways in which society can be structured. Discussing the fundamental structure of society is not useless. </p>

<p>P.s. &quot;everybody interprets it differently&quot; because there has been literally five decades of hyper-drive propaganda from bourgeois America telling innumerable lies about socialism. Funny how it&#39;s the same people who tell lies about unions... it&#39;s almost like they don&#39;t want the working class to organize? However socialism is always worker ownership of the means of production. The &quot;different interpretations&quot; are a result of there being a variety of ways to achieve this. Maybe discussing these things amongst the working class will be more beneficial than sticking one&#39;s head in the sand and saying &quot;we need more capitalism to be free&quot; while capitalist America continues to sell us all up the river right up until full automation is possible and wage-labor is no longer necessary. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, all are useless labels. Capitalists and socialists alike just use these labels as covers for their harmful acts. Just as capitalist tyrants say &quot;free market&quot; and people cheer without knowing exactly what for, socialists cheer when they hear &quot;equity&quot; or &quot;worker ownership,&quot; when in fact those changes never come about.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sure if it came down to creating a solid gameplan for how to run a state, all people would agree. But for now our media convinces us to argue only over words.</p>

<p>Ask yourself whether growth or sustainability is a more feasible goal for a society. Ask yourself which mindset might lead to a healthier balance between the environment and humans: stewardship or ownership?</p>

<p>The technological ideas you&#39;ve thrown out there are exciting, the investment in infrastructure, particularly space and energy technologies, but I wonder what those ideas might look like within a non-<em>economic</em>-growth frame.

<p>I used to be a socialist until I fully understood what Alexander Hamilton and George Washington wanted and it&#39;s not the capitalism we have today. What reigns today is the ancient old practice of looting, which is not capitalism.

</blockquote>

<p>It defies belief that one could be in any measure of the word a socialist and then fall prey to such delusion. Capitalism has no goal. You&#39;re anthropomorphizing it, deifying it in some weird way where it has some sort of intention or desired effect. It&#39;s merely a system of ownership. That&#39;s it. This system of ownership has undeniable effects on our society long term, and in itself incentivizes the very perversion of itself which you describe. Capitalism is driven towards profit. &quot;Crony&quot; capitalism is profitable. There will always be incentive for it, and just looking at history should tell you what tends to happen. </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>I would argue that what made him a great president were the strides made for worker&#39;s rights, environmental protections, publicly funded and owned infrastructure programs, etc., all of which <em>curtailed</em> the effects of capitalism gone rampant. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>It doesn&#39;t matter if you call yourself socialist or capitalist, as long as you establish a mechanism that encourage people to be productive.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You could make the same argument in defense of slavery, as long as it&#39;s &quot;productive&quot; enough, and that&#39;s how most socialists view wage labor under the capitalist system. My favorite quote on this is from Peter Kropotkin, a well regarded anarcho-socialist: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;We cry shame on the feudal baron who forbade the peasant to turn a clod of earth unless he surrendered to his lord a fourth of his crop. We called those the barbarous times. But if the forms have changed, the relations have remained the same, and the worker is forced, under the name of free contract, to accept feudal obligations. For, turn where he will, he can find no better conditions. Everything has become private property, and he must accept, or die of hunger.&quot;
-Peter Kropotkin</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If there is no means by which one may acquire private property, meaning capital, without working in servitude towards someone who already owns capital, meaning a capitalist, how is that any less a form of slavery? How is it any better than indentured servitude? Can you truly be free if there is no alternative to renting yourself to enrich another? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Problem with socialism is it encourages people to violently rebel and the banks always take the opportunity to capture the state apparatus during these situations.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think you misunderstand. Socialists believe that the people should own and control the means of production. There are many forms in which this may take, one of which I am inclined to support is anarcho-syndicalism, many of which are very different to what I assume your idea of socialism is. The general idea is that true democracy is impossible in a capitalist system as private ownership of capital inevitably translates to private ownership of power, which then inevitably has political influence. But again, supporting socialism doesn&#39;t necessarily mean whatever your view of it is as there are many schools of thought as to how to implement it. Nobody is saying &quot;to defeat evil we have to come and take your houses away,&quot; you know? A lot of people have that misconception. </p>
