       No... I'm saying jailing political opponents is good right? We only go after the last admin to justify takeover the country. We eliminate term limits for presidents because without Trump this country could go right back into a cesspool of freedom.

       He didn't. Mere presidents don't have the power to make those determinations. If anything, he leveraged to stem the tide of Wahabbism by helping to embolden Iran through support of the nuclear arms agreement. It's one thing I've learned to respect about his presidency, though I have considered that it may have been an agreement set up for failure, based on the absolutely terrible PR campaign unable to substantiate a single undeniable benefit to the US taxpayer, which seemed possibly intentional.
      </p>
      <p>
       His Secretaries of State on the other hand, die hard neocons, only worked towards the already entrenched system of support for the Israeli/Saudi backing of the Wahabbi terrorists.

       He is the closest thing you will ever get to a nonestablishment President.   You fill in unknowns with your preconceived imaginations.  If he fails in draining the swamp, in 20 years you will be kicking yourself for not supporting the guy you have been asking for for decades.

       I'm under no illusions America is unfair and that is what was supposedly supposed to make it great. Trump was born with golden spoons in his mouth. My mother came to America from a Native American reservation with nothing. She went to college and is still struggling in this capitalist society. Remember the "small loan of a million dollars" from Trump?
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm probably a communist/socialist but at this point in time and human history we need wageslaves until we can replace what I call the "lower class" (farmers, not as a inferior but the lower part of the pyramid to build civilization) with robots or basically engineers to control them who will be middle class.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then we can take everything from the rich and all humans can live comfortably without profit because we will be focused on maintaining the technology to feed us.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just my views, I don't know shit. I really don't think any of the news should hinder Trump in any fashion. He has a republican congress and house and they rolled back bank regulations so you can have that drained swamp.

       Oh yeah, how do you expect to solve your problems without socialism or communism? Trump speaks the language of the commies and all the right wing bought it after fervently fighting it for decades.

       Thanks, of course in part to Hillary pushing the Tough on Crime Bill, calling her citizens "super-predators" for crack at the exact same time as Gary Webb was revealing that crack was created and distributed by the CIA.

       Who created and introduced crack? Who used crack to write the Tough on Crime Bill? Committees were set up to look into Webb's allegations. Why when Gary Webb was telling the world that the CIA had created and started the distribution of crack was crack being used to punish people, increase police enforcement powers and numbers, and take away the rights of citizens?

       What confidential conversation with Comey leak? He talked to a friend about notes he took. Nothing discussed in the conversation was classified and as a private citizen Trump can no longer claim executive privilege.

       Yet during this whole mess, he appointed a guy that worked with Chris Christie over that whole bridge clusterfuck and the house passed a bill rolling back regulations on banks. Yeah that swamp sure is draining.

       Comey said "the content of the memo".

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        AMES COMEY, FORMER FBI DIRECTOR: The president tweeted on Friday, after I got fired, that I better hope there's not tapes. I woke up in the middle of night on Monday night because it didn't dawn on me originally that there might be corroboration for a conversation, there might be a tape. And my judgment was, I needed to get that out into the public square and so
        <strong>
         I asked a friend of mine to share the content of the memo with a reporter
        </strong>
        . I didn't do it myself for a variety of reasons, but I asked him to because I thought that might prompt the appointment of a special counsel. And so I asked a close friend of mine to do it.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       It's the bolded bit. Bolded means dark black. Here, I'll write it out by itself:
      </p>
      <p>
       Comey testified under oath: "
       <strong>
        I asked a friend of mine to share the content of the memo with a reporter
       </strong>
       "
      </p>
      <p>
       I used quotes and "Comey testified under oath:" to make it clear.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        I asked — the president tweeted on Friday after I got fired that I better hope there's not tapes. I woke up in the middle of the night on Monday night because it didn't dawn on me originally, that there might be corroboration for our conversation. There might a tape. My judgment was, I need to get that out into the public square. I asked a friend of mine to share the content of the memo with a reporter. Didn't do it myself for a variety of reasons. I asked him to because I thought that might prompt the appointment of a special counsel. I asked a close friend to do it.

       Trump has tried to influence or prevent Comey providing documentation or testifying before congress which means he is doing the same during an official proceeding. Congressional hearings are official proceedings, talking to a friend who then talks to a journalist is not.

       There really is no question about this, so I find it hard to understand the mindset of someone who tries to deflect. I find it fitting that those who try to deflect falsely describe "perjury" and then try to gain authority by saying they are citing criminal code.

       I linked you right to them. Okay, and even using your broader definition, again, talking to a colleague, friend, or reporter is not an official proceeding. Congressional hearings are. So again, there's no arena for Comey to have perjured himself in, except during the hearings. So show me him contradicting himself in his statements and testimony then we can talk. Til then, you go off and live in your bubble.

       In what way is releasing the information misleading? He's conveying his thoughts and opinions about a conversation. What about that is misleading?

       Yes, exactly. Congressional hearings are. Where Comey was under oath. And then lied about the reason and date of leaking the "content of the memo".
      </p>
      <p>
       Please, I hope you are not serious. I really think this is pretty basic. He went under oath and lied about the reason for his leak and it is 100% provable. His lie was to misdirect the proceedings. It was to cast Trump in a bad light and himself as acting in defence. It is blatantly misleading and 100% provably false.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you can't get that, if instead you try to talk about other things, try to lie about the meaning of perjury and then misdirect the sub as to when he perjured himself, there is really nothing I can say to you.

       You still haven't shown this. The links you posted at first show he did it because of the President's statements, and to get his side out there. How is that different than what he said?

       It's not "my" definition. If you don't understand that Comey was under oath and giving testimony yesterday, or are trying to deliberately mislead, then why bother talking to you?
      </p>
      <p>
       You have nothing to add. It's a clear cut case of perjury. The content of the memo was released on May 11th and Trump tweeted in response to it on May 12th. Comey deliberately made it seem as he had made a defensive move, when in fact it was a leak to attack Trump. End of story.

       The same link, that says what it has the entire time is, "during a judicial proceeding." I've already admitted I was wrong using that definition, I haven't changed the definition I used, but added a link to where I got it. That's all I really can/have to say about it.

       If DT does drain the swamp it will be at the end of his term via executive order. He has to be able to navigate the political arena  currently and draining the swamp doesnt help that. If he does it towards the end of his 4 year term it would increase his chances of getting re-elected. Doing it now will dissipate its potency .

       I'm under no illusions America is unfair and that is what was supposedly supposed to make it great. Trump was born with golden spoons in his mouth. My mother came to America from a Native American reservation with nothing. She went to college and is still struggling in this capitalist society. Remember the "small loan of a million dollars" from Trump?

       I'm probably a communist/socialist but at this point in time and human history we need wageslaves until we can replace what I call the "lower class" (farmers, not as a inferior but the lower part of the pyramid to build civilization) with robots or basically engineers to control them who will be middle class.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then we can take everything from the rich and all humans can live comfortably without profit because we will be focused on maintaining the technology to feed us.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just my views, I don't know shit. I really don't think any of the news should hinder Trump in any fashion. He has a republican congress and house and they rolled back bank regulations so you can have that drained swamp.

       Lol. Your quote was:

      <p>
       Perjury means misleading a jury. Show me a link which gives such a meaning. If not, then there could not have possibly been a link.
      </p>
      <p>
       There was no dropped ")" and the fact that you won't admit you utterly changed the definition and added a link is speaking volumes.
