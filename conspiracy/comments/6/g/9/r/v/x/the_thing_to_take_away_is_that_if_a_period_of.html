        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The fact that some of the building fell before the rest of the building entered free fall doesnt take anything away from the fact that, the a majority of the parts which constituted the building fell with zero resistance (nothing was opposing it) for a period of time. and the only way that could happen is if every support beam failed simultaneously, or failed in succession as the building was falling.
(like a row of dominoes: as the first one tips into the second one, some force causes the second one to start falling into the third one exactly as the first one hits the second so that the first one doesnt need to transfer any force to the second one. it may seem like a small amount of energy difference in this example, but the time needed for one domino to knock over the next one gets compounded into a total time for the whole series to fall, culminating in the last domino falling over. if the sequence of dominoes finishes 2 seconds before it was supposed to, you can conclude that the last domino falling over was not a consequence of the first one falling over, because it happened 2 seconds before the laws of physics allow it to happen).</p>

<p>This is precisely the reason why the NIST simulation wasn&#39;t provided for this free fall stage of collapse. As given their initial conditions, and initial collapse stages, it would have been impossible to get the simulation to play out the way we saw it (Collapse in free fall for a period of 2.5 seconds).</p>

<p>The chances that the entire support structures of the building collapsed first, only leaving the outer shell of the building to collapse without resistance is slim to none. Furthermore, if it DID happen that way, NIST would have rejoiced in their ability to show an accurate simulation for the entire collapse. but they didnt.. because the collapse didnt happen that way. So they weren&#39;t able to show the collapse in simulation.</p>
