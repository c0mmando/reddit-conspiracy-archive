<p>It isn&#39;t really about if it is anti-Trump or pro-Trump. It is about if it is real people having a real discussion, or if it is a circlejerk brigade just shitting on our sub. I would respect a real discussion by real people even if it conflicted with my perspective.</p>

It&#39;s because they are a party of the worlds biggest, most enormous, gigantic group of sore losers ever assembled and they don&#39;t know how to react.

    <div class="md"><p>You haven&#39;t talked about any of that shit since the election here.  It&#39;s all about Seth Rich and the Clinton&#39;s still.  This place turned into pushing pizzagate 24/7 during the election to discredit Hillary, now it gets a few mentions from random loyalist to it, but nothing like it did before.  Was this place huge for finding pedo rings before?  Why didn&#39;t anybody seem to care about Trump and his alleged raping of a 13yo and hanging out with Epstein?  Seems like if you cared about keeping a pedo out of the WH, he wouldn&#39;t be your choice.</p>

<p>And there are so plenty of people that follow conspiracies that don&#39;t want to suck Trump&#39;s dick all day. Which is why you feel like it&#39;s a brigade, but it&#39;s just the rest of conspiracy that isn&#39;t all of a sudden pro billionaire government.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>You care about trump so much.... <em>bit weird</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Do you not care about the current administration?  As part of conspiracy, that seems weird.  And yes, I do care about Trump because one of the biggest conspiracies of our country is unfolding in front of me.  Whether it be Russia collusion, just Russian interference, or possibly the deep state/media working to take down an entire administration.  I don&#39;t know what part of that wouldn&#39;t interest you if you are interested in conspiracies.</p>

<p>For Seth Rich, I never saw any credible​ evidence that convinced me that the Clinton&#39;s had him killed or he was the leaker.  People keep having big reveals, that reveal nothing...yet people keep eating it up.  So people like Kim Dot Com join the fun to get their name out there too so you can buy his CD.</p>

<p>And Clinton, I think she&#39;s shady as hell and a dirty politician, but I never saw anything <em>criminal</em> in the emails.  </p>

<p>Why are you convinced that a billionaire conman is on your side?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>yes. until the case is officially solved with supporting physical evidence to back up those claims. In regards to an unsolved murder, ALL theories are just conspiracy. Unfortunately, neither the PD or FBI have given evidence to support their &quot;robbery&quot; theory. And there&#39;s half a million dollar reward. Wouldn&#39;t you say that&#39;s pretty significant? </p>

He&#39;s been a lame duck president who&#39;s been mired in scandals and investigations since before he took office. Bet you didn&#39;t know he was in a 25 million dollar RICO case last year that he had to settle for fraud. Now the conman is busy obstructing justice and trying to get his swamp buddies off the hook. </p>

<li><p>I think to myself: HRC stealing the primaries is pretty fresh and well-covered.</p></li>
<li><p>I think to myself: HRC is out of power and Republicans are in power.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Why is this HRC stuff here? There can only be one reason: partisans.</p>

<p>Just to explain number two a little more: Yes, or course Conspiracy should cover things that happened in the past, but something that probably 99 percent of the people here still have fresh in their minds isn&#39;t exactly an exposition of value -- especially considering numbers one and three. :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s a solid post I can agree with, but the last link and claim is misleading.  Sure, the GOP has a history of election &quot;shenanigans&quot; (to say the least...), but so does the DNC.  It&#39;s all a farce, and both sides commit open election fraud in various ways.</p>

<p>I&#39;m convinced that the entire &quot;establishment&quot; had it rigged to get Hillary elected, including Trump himself.  Billions upon billions were spent on astroturfing, media blitzes, and fraudulent polling, to shoo in the Evil one.  Trump was the pied piper candidate, as indicated in the Podesta leaks, and spent the entire campaign being as big a buffoon as he possibly could.  I mean, hell...  he was even insulting the families of <em>fallen veterans</em>; political suicide, if we ever saw it.</p>

<p>But the best part, was that Hillary is soooo corrupt, so greedy, so hypocritical, and so murderous that it still wasn&#39;t enough to get her in.  When the election was a few weeks away, and Trump noticed that he could actually win it, he shut his damn mouth and finally just let her lose it.  Hillary&#39;s brazen corruption, combined with the social pushback fom her artificial media blitz snaked a win for Trump.  So yes, he <em>did</em> steal it, but not in the way you&#39;re saying.</p>

<p>Now, since he &quot;stole&quot; the election from the &quot;rightful&quot; heir, his deep state buddies must make an example of him.  Even though he parrots all the right lines, and follows the same Zionist policies, they will never forgive him, because he stole what wasn&#39;t his to take.</p>

<p>There :). I needed to put that out there :)</p>

I think the most likely possibility is that former &quot;Goldwater girl&quot; HRC sold her soul to the Republicans and buried herself for the double cross. HRC <em>believed</em> it would be rigged in her favor. The justice for HRC is sweet, but the result for the people is horrific.</p>

<p>They fooled HRC into believing that Donald Trump was &quot;unelectable.&quot; They fooled HRC into a position where she could not dispute the election. HRC was fooled.</p>

<p>But the best part, was that Hillary is soooo corrupt, so greedy, so hypocritical, and so murderous</p>

<p>Yes, and that&#39;s why they picked at &quot;outsider&quot; who never used the government to kill people for the simple reason that he never had the power to do so. They did a similar thing in 1991 when they nominated Clarence Thomas to the Supreme Court. The &quot;outsider&quot; thing and the lack-of-a-record thing are powerful tools.</p>

<p>I spent lots of time questioning whether Donald Trump really wanted to win. I am not absolutely sure now, but I lean strongly toward he was in on it from the beginning. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>GOP has a history of election &quot;shenanigans&quot;</p>

<p>From the same source, here&#39;s a really long <a href="http://www.weblinenews.com/gaming-elections/">article about elections</a>. </p>

<p>I respect your view, but I am pretty convinced now based upon the Donald Trump agenda that he was supposed to &quot;win&quot; this all along. Republicans will use him and protect him for all he is worth, but in the end, if absolutely necessary, they will stab him in the back too. This is IDEAL because they get their <a href="https://www.sanders.senate.gov/koch-brothers">Koch brothers agenda</a> with plausible deniability.</p>

<p>the legislation is real and it was signed into law by trump, you can verify this by pulling up the bill on congress.gov. i personally, feel the legislation is a piece of shit, full frontal assualt on the 99% aimed at consolidating once and for all the montary rentier feudalism of mature capitalism (that&#39;s your NWO). (for context, midieval feudalism was the consoldition if real property rentierism). </p>

<p>clinton would have signed the bill too, fwiw. after all dickin bimbos bill set it all in motion. but i have no desire to get in a thread solely to &quot;debate&quot; a point that 1/2 the posters already agree with and the other hakf don&#39;t, and neither side is going to budge. it&#39;s like entering WW1--insane destruction of serenity for no fucking reason.</p>

<p>A sub about conspiracy should be against the grand conspiracy. Which we all know is to dismantle boarders, subvert the country&#39;s sovereignty, permanently entangle the counties into world treaties, and create a one world government. Real conspiracy people know this has been the agenda for decades or even centuries.  </p>

<p>Major event in a very popular conspiracy theory with Comey&#39;s testimony.  People are going to the conspiracy sub to see what is being talked about.  &quot;OH MY GOD SHILLS SHILLS SHILLS!&quot;  No, just higher volume from the rest of reddit, who is much more liberal than this sub.</p>

<p>Do people really think this sub is so big and important they are paying people to argue here?  For what purpose?  People are acting like the 2k population is 25-50% shills, as if it makes any sense at all the pay people to try to sway at most 2 thousand people.  When we&#39;re still 18 months to a mid-term election.  And the people here are mostly not voting democrat anyway.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just because it exists doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s wasting time here, at least not anywhere near the amount people claim.  According to the wild accusations they&#39;re half of all posts in every thread.  That&#39;s nonsense.  The simple cost of doing something like that here, where it will get so little benefit, is prohibitive.  You can go on facebook, full of people who don&#39;t know shit and don&#39;t question where there news comes from, and you can power out a lot more propaganda and have a much, much bigger impact than you can on this sub.</p>

<p>This false belief that the sub consists of people who think like me, and shills, is why there is very little actual discussion.  Over and over again it&#39;s just a claim, a rebuttal, then the vague shill accusations start.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Their tactics are literal shit. I mean they originally came here to push Hillary in office and just look at his bad it back fired. MSM is a fucking joke, the Democratic Party is beyond fucked.. In reality all their scum fuck tactics have lead us to where we are at right now..</p>

<p>How fucking disapppointing it must be to make a living off of spreading hatred and divide. That&#39;s all the shills were sent here for. Real fucking American these assholes are. How about we start a new party in 2020. Call it &quot; The GOOD party.&quot; For anyone who supports being a good human being. Fuck the DNC, Fuck The Donald, Fuck Hillary. Fuck Obama, Fuck McCain, Fuck Pedosta, Fuck all these sell out fucks. Let&#39;s raise above these cocksucksers</p>
