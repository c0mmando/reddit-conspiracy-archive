       I think many people who resisted Trump at first, and then finally 'caved in", did it due to desperation. Americans who care about their future, and their kid's future are scared and are desperate. Trump is a salesman. He gave a great sales pitch, and desperate people followed his admonition that was directed at those  desperate people: "Vote for me. What do you have to lose?"

       Considering the playing field they had and the results, one datapoint is enough. Sometimes two boxers only need to fight once to decisively know who's better.

       They still get to choose their staff. In fact, that's one of the top three most important parts of the presidency, appointing staff. Sounds like Trump is better at that, too.

       At least her illegal shit wasn't being a pawn for Putin. We elected a candidate that is quite possibly at the mercy of our greatest geopolitical adversary. I can't believe the mental gymnastics trump supports go through and cognitive dissonance that they use to support a horrible horrible person who could care less about America. His whole entire group of people surrounding him are heavily in bed with the Russians how is that better than Clinton? Yea the both fucking suck but at least one of them ultimately isn't a fucking traitor.

       He wouldn't! I'm agreeing with you! His supporters will make any excuse to justify his shitty actions that go directly against their own wishes. And even worse he's most likely being held by the balls by the Russians, which is way worse than Clinton. They both fucking suck but at least one isn't a pawn of Russia.

       Why are you being so hostile. It really detracts from what you are trying to promote. There's plenty of evidence out there that isn't even conspiracy the Wall Street journal did an amazing info graphic showing all the people around Gina ND their concrete connections to the Russians. I'm not worrying about past failed political candidates I'm making a statement showing how he is not the better candidate between the two shitty options we had. I'm agreeing with you and you are being so damn hostile.

       What about my post makes you think I'm a trump supporter? I hate the dude. I knew he was a puppet too. So did anyone with a brain. Are you even reading anything I'm saying? I don't need to make a post about it. The comment sections are designed to talk about things. If they were meant for only talking about what the post was about then there wouldn't be any comments. Why are you being so hostile towards me? It's like no matter what I say you attack me. "holy shit you DJT riders are obvsly controlled op."? Like what I've only said things criticizing trump why does that make me a "rider" once again calm down and try to have a civil discussion and read what I'm saying. I even gave you a link from the WSJ showing what I'm talking about and you completely ignore it and call me a trump supporter? Seriously what is wrong?

       Trump is taking down nothing. He is The Establishment. He always was and always will be. In fact he is getting worse. His son in law is a Mossad Agent. Trump is close friends with Larry "Pull It" Silverstein and Bibi "911" Netanyahu. Trumps uncle was the man who confiscated Nikola Tesla's research papers. Trump is a complete "Insider". He serves the 1% and not anyone else...

       The media is doing a fantastic job at making him not look part of the establishment. Hell, it's making people want him out of office. Not saying you're wrong, but it just seems like a waste of money to focus so much hate on one of their own.

       I didnt support Trump because of everything he said... As soon as Hillary/Kaine started saying we should treat cyber attacks like any attack &amp; the 4 minutes to launch talk... All which happened just weeks before the election.  I dont know if it really matters who wins but i noped the fuck right out of supporting her.  That &amp; i kinda wanted to see what it would be like having an internet troll run the United States.  No regrets so far.

       I'd say the references to Barack Obama are overwhelming.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why are users still bringing up a failed candidate when I've made several references to Barack?
      </p>
      <p>
       It's hard work keeping the
       <strong>
        Hillary vs. Trump users
       </strong>
       on track.

       The banking cabal makes money destabilizing economies and financing wars.
      </p>
      <p>
       The political crime families, like Bush and Clinton, make money taking bribes and trafficking drugs/guns/people.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump made his money on hotels and casinos. He needs a robust middle class to stay at his hotels and gamble in his casinos, or his kids are left with empty buildings, defaulted loans, and bankrupt companies.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump doesn't want to change the system. The system is already changing to billionaires and poor, with no middle class in between. He is financially motivated to reverse that change and change it back to a strong middle class.
      </p>
      <p>
       The bankers and political crime families make more money bankrupting the middle class.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not everyone makes their money the same way. We are better aligning with people with mutual interests, like a middle class to buy their products, than people who want to drug us, kidnap us, shoot us, and make us poor for their own enrichment.

       The thesis of the topic is "why would someone take down a system that benefited them so greatly" and you're telling me Clinton is a better choice? Is that a joke?
