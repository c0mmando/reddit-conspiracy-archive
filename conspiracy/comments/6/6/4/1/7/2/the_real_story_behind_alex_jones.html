       Any time I see such a strong consensus on this sub, I get a little nervous. I've never been a viewer of his, but is there any chance that Jones' team is now scrambling to brand him as an actor/satirist so that he can't be sued over the Pizzagate coverage for libel?

       I've read the tale, seen the comparison pictures,and I'm still not sold on this. It's compelling (and fun as hell to boot) but I'm not convinced. There are pictures of a young Alex Jones who doesn't look like Bill Hicks.

       I thought everybody considered him an actor... I can't believe all of his subscribers actually believe what he says. He probably did more damage to his and his guest's "messages" just by being himself than by claiming he's an actor. So, I'm failing to see a conspiracy here.

       If he's obviously an actor, then why would anyone serious about their topic of research go on his show? And if he's the real deal, then why the smear campaign against him?

       It's the speed and intensity of the hate that set off some bells so I decided to get a discussion going. I don't care about Jones and I never watched more than a few clips over the years, the situation just seems a bit off.

       desperate for exposure would be my guess. I wouldn't advise anyone who's serious about anything to talk about it on his show.

       I've watched this guy go from being the only one questioning Israel and the government's story on 9/11 to being isreael's #1 fan and the president's most zealous supporter. Throw this in with his snake oil salesmanship, playbook contard baiting, and his interdimensional gnome theories etc., and you get a picture of someone who isn't even taking themselves seriously.

       Alex Jones is a red faces baboon flinging political feces. And had no right to call himself a contard. Because he is working for the very elites he's "attempting" to undermine. It's all a facade for those in power to distract you.

       Yes but that has nothing to do with  Mr. Jones he's like a rook but still just a piece on the board. Celebrities are made not born and those in their position of perceived power utilize them like they do everything else. Including us, they play the game; we are the game. They are withholding knowledge to maintain control. And it distorts everything you are capable of. In truth. The world, time, your very existence are altered. But there's someone fighting for a natural balance. I believe in that. However as of now we are like children telling ghost stories in the night. Being woke.. you have no idea. Pizzagate, secret societies are nothing compared to what's really out there.

       I think it is manipulative - they are using his child as leverage. If he claims that is what he thinks, and is not acting, he would lose his child.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have thought he is controlled opposition, but the nature of this court case and the resulting smear campaign are fishy.

       He was never attacked for being conspiracy theorist he was attacked for saying he wanted to break some actor's neck and that some lady should be raped and that he was going to kill a congressman.

       Look, this isn't ultimately about Jones fearing a lawsuit or even getting custody of his kid.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is about Jones protecting the lives of his ex-wife and his son.
      </p>
      <p>
       William Thompkins, the 94 year old who blew the whistle regarding his involvement in designing ships for the Secret Space Program and the existence of Draco Reptilians (who, yes, do actually eat humans and thrive on negative energy induced via fear), is 100% correct.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is why DynCorp is involved in abducting children. Partly to feed an innocent, tabula rasa being to the Draco for maximum negative energy induced via fear....and partly for brownstoning politicians and then blackmailing them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Furthermore, a SIGNIFICANT amount of all this shady, deplorable, crime against humanity activity is carried out by private companies based in Texas (Stratfor being a big player not for talked about).
      </p>
      <p>
       A lot of this shit centers around Houston and Austin....and it's no coincidence that oil and private defense companies are intricately intertwined for service to The Deep State.
      </p>
      <p>
       Texas is ground fucking zero base of operations for the unholy Deep State, oil, defense Trinity that has kept secret from us the out of this world technology for years.

       Okay, here's your chance.  post me to some SOURCE facts and proofs of ANYTHING which you are claiming.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since I know you don't have any source data ... let me give you some question topics for you to address.
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         Do you honestly think that they only "Establishment sceptics" are in the far right fringe?   That no one in the center right, or any where in the Moderate or Left groups are remotely anti-Establishment?    If you can't think of highly reputable, Left, anti-Establishment organisations or people ... you have to ask your self what sort of cool aid are you smoking??
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Why is it that all these "lizards" happen to be one or all of:  a) Jewish  b) Democrats,  c) wealthy?    Is that because those are the scape-goat groups which you have been fed to believe are the sources of the problems?
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         How is such a large, disparate and multi-generational cabal could keep these world shattering secrets and yet a) you know them and b) no one from the inside has either intentionally or not divulged information about them?  Are you willing to believe that every other whistle blower was a stooge/shill acting on this cabal's behalf??  Are you willing to tell that face to face with ... say ... Larry Kunstler?  Noam Chomsky?  Edward Snowden?  Chelsea Manning?  and MANY others?
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       I'll save those for later.  If you choose to respond with answers to these questions, I hope you do so with genuine thought.  I'm going to review any source data you post ... I'll do so an eye to understanding not only WHAT the claim is (that's
       <em>
        usually
       </em>
       easy) but also WHY and HOW they base the claim on.

       If he's controlled opposition, he's doing a pretty shitty job of it. Yes, he gives conspiracy theorists a bad name with his antics, but at the same time he's opened the minds of a lot of people. if my kids were being taken away from me, I would say all kinds of shit to win the lawsuit. That doesn't make international political and economic corruption go away.

       He stepped out on his wife, she found out, divorced him, and now he's in a custody battle with her over their child.
      </p>
      <p>
       In a battle like that you're going to see a lot of accusations flying around, and since his ex-wife feels scorned and betrayed you can bet your sweet bippy that she's going to maintain that he's an unfit parent and an untrustworthy person who shouldn't have custody and she'll use whatever evidence she can including his on-air theatrics to maintain that he's quite possibly erratic and  unstable as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       Who knows? Maybe he is? He's certainly self-centred and has and oversized ego and the woman he became involved with was a woman he hired for his program and put on his payroll.
      </p>
      <p>
       So it's hard to keep that aspect out of the custody battle because it has such a direct bearing on the entire situation. Let's face it, it's a scandal and Alex Jones is the one whose behavior was scandalous and there's always high price to paid whenever that happens and it will take some time before people get over it.
      </p>
      <p>
       And yes a lot of ordinary people are offended, especially some of die-hard fans, or maybe I should say ex-fans, that happened to trust and look up to him and thought he was an honest guy and a straight-shooter and who also feel somewhat betrayed at the moment.
      </p>
      <p>
       In addition to that he also has plenty of people who don't happen to like him and never trusted him for which this seems to vindicate what they believed and said all along.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's nothing unusual about any of this. Alex Jones is simply having his dirty laundry washed in public, and there's going to be a lot of nasty talk about him because there's always a lot of nasty talk about anyone who finds themselves in that situation and the more well known they are the more nasty talk your going to hear about them.
