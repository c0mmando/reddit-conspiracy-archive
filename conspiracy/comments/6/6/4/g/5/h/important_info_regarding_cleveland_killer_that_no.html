        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I stayed up literally ALL night the night before last trying to figure this whole situation out. In a nutshell what i found out:
Murtis Taylor (the company that Joy Lane works at) is a corrupt AF agency who neglects people who depend on them for mental health treatment resulting in a lot of people who end up losing their shit, killing themselves, and killing others.</p>

<p>Murtis Taylor also uses their power to take kids from homes for BS reasons and sues to gain legal custody of children to put into foster care</p>

<p>Beech Brook (killers former workplace) is a facility for troubled children, and until last year also functioned as an adoption/foster care agency/facility</p>

<p>These two places are within miles and in the same county as the international adoption agency that the FBI raided months ago</p>

<p>Children were sexually abused at Beech Brook by its staff</p>

<p>More than 3100 reports of missing children in 2015 in this county alone</p>

<p>Dozens of cases of child abuse just reopened after being ignored/not investigated for years</p>

<p>Beech Brook and Murtis Taylor are very short distance from Great Lakes which means children could be trafficked to Canada, New York, and through to the Atlantic Ocean</p>

<p>2 pastors arrested days ago in this county for child trafficking/child sex abuse.</p>

<p>One of the pastors wives works for the government for CPS type agency</p>

<p>...and lots of other shit i found out too but thats all i can remember right now, but like i said, there is a LOT more fuckery i dug up.
There is definitely more to this story than meets the eye.</p>

<p>Why do you think Stephens kept on and kept on and kept on mentioning Joy Lane, Murtis Taylor, and Beech Brook?</p>

<p>Why do you think he said to let his boss know he wouldn’t be at work the next day he posted, “I’m sorry team but I’m to far gone [sic] ...
I’m the #goodguy”?</p>

<p>Things that make you go &quot;hmmmmm&quot;.</p>

<p>EDIT:
Ok, so dude is dead now, but WHY IS THE PASSENGER WINDOW BLOWN OUT AND NOT THE DRIVER SIDE? Judging by the shooting vid, the guy is obviously right handed.</p>

<p>WHY IS THERE NO BLOOD SPATTER?</p>

<p><a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/cleveland-facebook-killer-steve-stephens-dead-car-after-pursuit-pa-n747821">http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/cleveland-facebook-killer-steve-stephens-dead-car-after-pursuit-pa-n747821</a></p>

<p>This is going to drive me crazy.</p>

<p>I feel SO fucking tinfoil right now. But this doesn&#39;t make sense.</p>

<p>Was Stephens wanting to expose all the fuckery at MT and BB and was found out? </p>

<p>Cops finally close in and then he is found with &quot;intentional gunshot wound to the head&quot;. </p>

<p>I mean seriously. What the hell is going on?</p>

<p>Edit: Oh, also in one of the vids he mentioned specific places where the rest of the bodies supposedly were, but I think they may actually be places where some other kind of fuckery goes on, or has gone on, but this is just a guess, obviously I don&#39;t know for sure.</p>

<p>One of the places was at &quot;42nd and Payne&quot; - well, there is no 42nd, there is 41st and 43rd, but if there <em>was</em> a 42nd, this is what it would run through:</p>

And the May building has a basement too, probably not worth mentioning, but just figured I&#39;d throw it out there.</p>

<p>I can&#39;t believe I haven&#39;t seen other people ask questions about this. SOMETHING is fucked up here, majorly fucked up. If only I didn&#39;t live on the opposite side of the country, ughhh</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t understand the hate. Pizzagate is a conspiracy as well. I would never dispute that powerful people do bad shit daily. My mind can&#39;t handle thinking about abused children. So I don&#39;t spend much time clicking on the 50000 posts concerning it.</p>

<p>This post intrigued me because this FB shooter is current and extremely relevant here in the US. I liked how the puzzle was put together about trafficking where dude worked. So quickly by using the woman&#39;s name the shooter referred to when he was on the phone.</p>

His badge is on the opposite side as normal.  He&#39;s driving with his real left hand but this mirrored Video makes it appear to be his right.

One example that comes to mind is the video of the Uber driver being berated and threatened, it was all over the front page a week or two ago. So that&#39;s why it seems to be filmed in the passenger seat rather than driver.</p>

<p>I would suggest adding some facts that show how your numbers balance with the rest of the U. S. or even better cities or region with a similar geographic makeup. </p>

<p>Ok I&#39;ll bite, do you realize that a corporation can still do things it does not have the legal authority to do? This is such a stupid comment on a subreddit like this where almost everything is done without legal authority...
We don&#39;t have answers to your questions yet because this JUST happened. Go read up more on this incident and you will realize things do not add up, there is clearly foul play here and we are trying to get to the bottom of it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes I realize that, I explore facts. Murtis Taylor does not have the legal authority to do what is suggested. Are you indicating a small non-profit that provides behavioral health services with a couple million dollar budget is just stealing kids off of the street? Where have you or OP shown any evidence or reason to suggest this is even remotely true? Did I miss a source even remotely suggesting the possibility? Is it because they are close to the Great Lakes? </p>

<p>There are plenty of users of this sub that answer ten fold what I have asked with their positions and replies and you can&#39;t even begin to scrape the surface of forming a plausible theory. Yet you resort to insults. You are what is pulling this sub down. </p>

<p>I asked for more evidence, that is not trolling. If OP wants to be taken seriously he should realize, correlation is not causation, that is basic. </p>

<p>A question that keeps getting ignored is why would this guy kill some random person over what the OP is suggesting? He was using social media, why didn&#39;t he start talking about what allegedly made him snap aside from a woman? </p>

<p>These are not inappropriate questions to ask and in no way concert trolling. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>i&#39;ve seen the video maybe a dozen times or so, frame by frame in the killing seconds and it&#39;s too wonky. the physics don&#39;t make sense during his 360° spin, the dead body shouldnt be thrown back against the fence when shot point blank by a pistol or other small caliber gun, his body would just drop and he would fall on his back, since the impact into the head would cause the shift in weight. he was on his back in the video after the spin, ofc you dont see him falling. the blood is pretty bright, which can be normal in old age, depending his oxygen levels and whether an artery or vein is hit, but 2-3 seconds after being shot in the head, there should still be a few squirts of blood coming out, but nothing happens. also the line of blood being exactly where there is a &quot;shadow&quot; before he&#39;s being killed, while the &quot;shadow&quot; no longer is there when he&#39;s lying there raises questions too. 
the 360° spin could be some &quot;panic&quot; move, since it&#39;s super stressful and he probably would spin to loosen himself up and make sure no one aint watching or something like that, assessing situation. 
but then, based on some livestreams i&#39;ve seen on the day of the &quot;killing&quot;, where people drove by the scene, it wasn&#39;t marked as a crime scene, there was no blocked parameter or anything, which there would be if someone actually was killed, it&#39;s protocol and guideline. 
i&#39;ve also seen a couple minutes of CNN just to see what they want people to believe, and they kept repeating his age, that he&#39;s a random victim and that SS is still on the run and that he could be anywhere (making sure to mention boston marathon for flashback bonus points). just more questions, as usual.</p>

<p>on a non-provable note, i watched quite a bit of violent footage in my life, not for entertainment but self-education in general, and when there&#39;s a real death, i always get a unique feeling in my stomach and i keep thinking about it a few times that day, putting myself in all the perspectives and shit to figure out how people feel and what gets them to behave in their ways. i had nothing of that sort when watching the video here. to me personally that&#39;s evidence, but i dont see it as that for other people, you gotta figure that out for yourself probably.  </p>

<p>Chances are they found him before the cops did, or a few of the cops on the local force found him, and they killed him.</p>

Stephens wasnt in a sound state of mind and he killed simply for the attention of his ex fiance and mother. There doesnt have to be any sort of bigger conspiracy behind his actions. Facebook Live was bound to eventually bring this kind of act out in a mentally unstable user, and I feel like no one here is taking into consideration all of the suicides that have been broadcast since its introduction.  Killers have been filming their actions since the creation of video recordings. If it werent for the &quot;instant upload&quot; effect this would have just been another murder video among the tens-of-thousands of others you can find on the various shock sites across the web.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No doubt in my mind... The Cleveland Killer was Murdered by cops.
Look at the photo of his car....
<a href="http://imgur.com/a/w4mvi">http://imgur.com/a/w4mvi</a>
Look at the Damage to the car. Look at the positioning of the car. Look at the front tire of the SUV.. The cops killed this guy. after a Police chase. There is no way his car was just parked like this while he casually shot himself.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes! I initially had some qualms about it looking fake, but when the media was reporting and everyone else was buying into it being real, I was like well, it must be real. But the 360 like you said, and I mentioned in my post. The old guy just happens to be out of frame right when the gun is actually fired. There is a lot of blood when he comes back into the image, from one shot. I seriously just went to r/watchpeopledie and watched like 7 videos of point blank shootings and executions and NOT A SINGLE ONE had a puddle of blood surrounding them after the shot. All of these things are starting to make this whole situation very very fishy.</p>

I haven&#39;t gone back to watch it yet, and I&#39;m at work right now, but I do recall not being &quot;shocked&quot; by that video due to lack of graphic nature. The idea of it was shocking, but not neccesarily the gore aspect. I&#39;ll check it out on lunch and edit this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oxygenated blood is a far brighter red than deoxygenated blood.</p>

<p>If I had to guess the scientific reason, it would be that oxygen molecules fill in the &quot;holes&quot; on the surface of the hemoglobin so that it&#39;s smoother and reflects more light.  For example, that new super-dark vanta black paint works by growing a &quot;forest&quot; of carbon tubes that traps the light.  If deoxygenated blood has a much more porous surface, it would explain the darker color. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great post. I desperately hope one of these strange happenings will finally be the key to busting this sick pedophilia shit, if this is indeed somehow related. For my baby daughters sake. And they do use child protective services and the like to illegally snatch kids for complete bs reasons and allow them to be abused and for pornography. Its just like the prison system: private prison gets paid more for each body, so they pay judges to hand out stricter sentencing and put them in their prison. So Idk what that other dude was talking about that was complaining about being downvoted, everything in this country is or has been a involved in a Racket, even those supposedly trying to &#39;help&#39; poor children or provide mental health services. Good finds.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay. Lemme add to this a second. I&#39;m sure a lot of you have seen the same videos of executions and stuff that I have. 2 things about the video that bother me. The blood and it&#39;s splatter look off. I&#39;m no crime scene analyst, but something just does not look right about all of it. Second thing, the shooter does like a 360 spin or something as he is shooting because you don&#39;t actually see the shot happen. Now, those 2 things alone are fine. There is a lot of media presence, a confirmed kill etc. Normally on a fake viral video or something like this, these 2 things would spark controversy over if it were fake or not, and it would be traced back to some advertising agency or something. However, if the government is using this to cover up something, it would be a lot harder to trace because, well, it&#39;s the government doing it as opposed to just a run of the mill company. Also! This went on for multiple days, and incited fear by the shooter claiming to have killed 15 or so people, none of which have been confirmed. This makes me feel like all of this was put on as a distraction. How did it take so long to find him? As soon as he was live streaming, you would have thought the cops would have had this dudes location asap. He walked up on a guy and shot him in broad daylight, and in the video I&#39;m pretty sure you can hear witnesses screaming. How did he make it so long! A lot of things just don&#39;t add up to this. I&#39;m not a big conspiracy theorist by any means, so I don&#39;t really feel like I&#39;m digging deep here. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Using a different account to protect my identity on my main account...</p>

<p>I used to work at Beech Brook. Yes, there have been cases of sexual abuse but this was many years ago and they have put many practices into place to prevent it from happening again. </p>

<p>In regards to the Ohio guidestone death...it is obviously unfortunate but death from a restraint is not unheard of. We did restraints at BB too. We were trained in how to do them and had to be recertified in this training every 6 months. The kids are much more aggressive than your training partners will be and thus it is very hard to actually do a restraint perfectly. Restraints are only done when the child is in imminent danger of severely hurting themselves or someone else. Extensive paperwork justifying the restraint and explaining all that happened is completed after it happens. </p>

<p>There is absolutely no way that BB is trafficking children. Most of the children involved in the agency are in foster care, meaning more tabs are kept on them by a multitude of people than your average kid. </p>

<p>Why did he talk about his workplace in the video? Probably because it is a very stressful and depressing place to work. These kids&#39; lives are pretty fucked up. They were put into foster care because their families had abused and/or neglected them. As a result of this, they developed severe mental and behavioral issues, which is what led them to be placed with BB. When you hear these kids stories and develop empathy for them AND become their target for taking their shit out on, and try to balance those two conflicting roles, it&#39;s very draining. Now, you have to have underlying mental issues for it to drive you to do what Steve Stephens did, but I can see why it added to his pile of stressors. </p>

Most are sad about not being with their biological family, as most people would be. However they also understand (to the extent that a kid can) that the abuse and neglect they went through by their parents is wrong and that they were removed for their own safety, and they are thankful for that. Most of the traumatization is from the abuse and neglect. Some do return to their biological families if the court deems that they will be safe there. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>They are not violently removed. Also, CPS is responsible for removing kids from bio families and putting them in foster care or a residential facility, not places like Beech Brook. Wasn&#39;t sure if that was clear. Of course they miss home, most people would. But mixed with those feelings are feelings of anger and hurt due to the abuse and neglect they experienced by their family that is supposed to love and protect them. I remember kids being very homesick one day and the next day they would be so angry at their parent or whoever it was that had abused them. It&#39;s a difficult situation for anyone to go through. Throw that on top of being a kid and life is pretty shitty. </p>

After reading your post and how much you managed to uncover, really hones it in that investigative journalism is dead and all we are fed now is propaganda. And to think, all this information was available &amp; accessible to all of us. Once again,Well done OP, get a goodnights rest.</p>

<p>Could you source this please? Doing my own digging myself but I find no evidence of this claim. If this is made-up, then it&#39;s a bit dishonest and irresponsible...not doubting the merits of your argument as a whole, definitely something fishy going on. </p>
