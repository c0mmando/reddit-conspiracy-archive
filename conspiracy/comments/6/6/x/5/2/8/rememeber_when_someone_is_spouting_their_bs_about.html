       Ask any round earther to provide 100% proof the earth is round, they can't. They can't go to the moon. Shot they can't even provide a real picture of the entire earth at once. They're full of shit and do not live in reality.

       Have you ever heard of the logical fallacy "Burden of proof?" Why is my job to prove that the earth is round when there is quantifiable data supporting that the earth is round? It's YOUR job to prove that the earth is flat in this case, as the earth being round is a well-known fact.

       Anyone can say the burden of proof is on the next person, about anything.

       The sky looks blue, but that's just how we perceive it, it's not really blue, and the burden of proof is on you, because you're the one so adamant that the sky is blue.

       So if I came up to you and said "all gasoline is really just afterbirth from women in third world countries," it'd just be your perception that the burden of proof is on me? I feel like the person making the more outlandish claim needs to prove said claim.

       And considering it's been common knowledge for centuries that the earth is round, it's a little ridiculous that OP is so angry that anyone would question that the earth is flat.

       it's easy to say the person who has the most outlandish claim needs to prove that claim, but in all honestly, outlandishness is a matter of perspective.
      </p>
      <p>
       To flat earthers, it's outlandish that you can't see there is no curve of the earth at 8 miles. to ball earthers, it's outlandish that anyone would question that the earth is a ball, we went to the freakin moon after all! right?
      </p>
      <p>
       The burden of proof falls on those who can and want to prove things. but not for nothing, I know for a FACT, for a motherfucking FACT, that neither you nor I have actually Proved where gasoline comes from or what it's made up of. We just take it for granted because when we fill up our cars there it is and the people who provide it, well they said it's not afterbirth from women, so it must not be, right?

       You found it in the ground, pulled it up yourself, processed it to gasoline and then used it in your car? that's impressive, not sure many people living today can say the same thing.

       So without physically harvesting it myself, I don't know what's in Gasoline? Your level for understanding is extremely high. If I'd tested food products in a lab, i guess I wouldn't know that a potato is a potato, even if I've done quantifiable experiments that prove it's a potato?

       Well that's two different things right?

      <p>
       I can go and grow potatoes, harvest and eat it, maybe even rename it if I wanted. Now when it comes to gasoline, it's not one person from start to finish turning oil into gasoline, it's multi-part involving god knows how many people.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's just an analogy that you're trying to make literal sense of, and even then what you're comparing it to is not even on the same level, so you're being intentionally misleading in your 'counter-argument'
      </p>
      <p>
       The point is, unless you do something from start to finish yourself whilst understanding the hows, whys, and means of it all, you really don't have a clue, your mind is just filling in the gaps that you do not know about or understand.

       Thanks for posting this thread Kayla - this is a good metric for the community to determine how few people are buying ibto the flat earth psyop.  Here's a few tips for some of the next psyops you can try now that this is a failure:
      </p>
      <p>
       -elements dont exist
-we dont need oxygen to breathe
      </p>

       I can go on
