    <div class="md"><p>it&#39;s easy to say the person who has the most outlandish claim needs to prove that claim, but in all honestly, outlandishness is a matter of perspective. </p>

<p>To flat earthers, it&#39;s outlandish that you can&#39;t see there is no curve of the earth at 8 miles. to ball earthers, it&#39;s outlandish that anyone would question that the earth is a ball, we went to the freakin moon after all! right? </p>

<p>The burden of proof falls on those who can and want to prove things. but not for nothing, I know for a FACT, for a motherfucking FACT, that neither you nor I have actually Proved where gasoline comes from or what it&#39;s made up of. We just take it for granted because when we fill up our cars there it is and the people who provide it, well they said it&#39;s not afterbirth from women, so it must not be, right? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well that&#39;s two different things right? </p>

<p>I can go and grow potatoes, harvest and eat it, maybe even rename it if I wanted. Now when it comes to gasoline, it&#39;s not one person from start to finish turning oil into gasoline, it&#39;s multi-part involving god knows how many people. </p>

<p>It&#39;s just an analogy that you&#39;re trying to make literal sense of, and even then what you&#39;re comparing it to is not even on the same level, so you&#39;re being intentionally misleading in your &#39;counter-argument&#39; </p>

<p>The point is, unless you do something from start to finish yourself whilst understanding the hows, whys, and means of it all, you really don&#39;t have a clue, your mind is just filling in the gaps that you do not know about or understand. </p>
