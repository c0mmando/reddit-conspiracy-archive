        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Ancient human history remains a mystery to us. In my study of ancient cultures I have noticed a great many similarities in the architectural style, symbolism, and religious myths of many distinct civilizations. This has led me to question the origins of human civilization and I now pose the hypothesis that there was indeed an exceedingly advanced, unified, global civilization and culture that flourished before a cataclysmic series of meteor impacts approximately 12,000 years ago. Many of this culture&#39;s traditions and influences are present in the civilizations that began just after our most recent agricultural revolution. </p>

<p>In this first installment, I will be covering similarities in architectural styles including mortarless polygonal masonry and stone knobbing, shaping, drilling, cutting, and fitting. </p>

<p>Mortarless Polygonal Masonry is present at numerous ancient sites all over the world. This architectural style consists of large stone blocks, often granite, andesite, basalt, or quartzite, placed in a tightly fitting geometric tessellation. These tight geometric fittings allow for the transfer of seismic energy to help prevent earthquake damage, as well as eliminating the need for mortar. <a href="https://imgur.com/a/oiWKB">https://imgur.com/a/oiWKB</a></p>

<p>At many of the sites where this style of polygonal masonry is found, we also find odd knob-like protrusions on certain stones. I call this stone knobbing. Although we are not quite certain of the purpose of these knobs, it is speculated that they were used as some form of astronomical calendar system. It has been observed that these knobs cast shadows down the walls they lay on in alignment with certain seasonal occurrences such as equinoxes and solstices. <a href="https://imgur.com/a/MxnJ6">https://imgur.com/a/MxnJ6</a></p>

<p>Another architectural style that appears at these very same sites is something I like to call the &quot;dimension doorway.&quot; Many ancient sites have similar features in their doorways, archways, and windows where it appears that there is a door within a door, as well as three dimensional geometric perspective showing depth. In many cases we see false doors and false windows in this same style. Also, in many cases we can see the presence of a slanted &quot;T&quot; shape similar to the pillars at Gobekli Tepe or a Japanese Torii. <a href="https://imgur.com/a/DPBBT">https://imgur.com/a/DPBBT</a> </p>

<p>In every instance where these other architectural elements are present, we see an advanced knowledge of stone working far surpassing the level that is supposed by modern academia. According to the current timeline laid down by mainstream historians and academics, these cultures had no other methods and apparatuses for stonecutting apart from bronze and stone tools. This assertion casts enormous doubt on what is known about these cultures&#39; architectural abilities. At sites such as The Giza Plateau, Puma Punku, Tiwanaku, Machu Picchu, Sacsayhuaman, Tikal, Teotihuacan, Aswan, Baalbek, Yonaguni, Kekova, Gobekli Tepe, Gornaya Shoria, Easter Island, Yangshan, Barabar, Ellora, Gunung Padang, Nan Madol, and countless others we see the work of skilled architects and masons with technologies able to cut, carve, drill, shape, and, most importantly, move massive quantities of stone. If these were, in fact, the work of slaves at the whims of greedy kings, then we need better evidence of that assertion. We have no reason to believe that these cites were made by those who were working towards their own death. <a href="https://imgur.com/a/XBwNn">https://imgur.com/a/XBwNn</a> <a href="https://imgur.com/a/xuCMz">https://imgur.com/a/xuCMz</a></p>

<p>I, just as many others before me, am suggesting that the timeline accepted and perpetuated by mainstream academia is not only wrong, but it is a lie, a lie meant to keep the common people ignorant to reality and ignorant to our true potential as human beings. We are biologically identical to our homo sapien ancestors who lived 200,000 years ago. It is an insult to our species and our intelligence to think that we did nothing within our vast potential until 6,000 years ago. </p>

<p>Believe nothing that you have been told. Even what I am telling you now. Question EVERYTHING. Make up your own mind and discover reality for yourself.</p>

<p>Thank you, all. I will see you in Part 2...</p>

<p>Edit: MY FRIENDS! We are here together to learn from one another. Believers and disbelievers alike, I welcome you to join in the knowledge. This post has been met with a greater reception than I could have ever imagined and I thank you all. We have just begun to walk this long path before us. I have tried to respond to as many of you as I can manage, and I will continue to do so. I hope you, and those you share this with, will be stand by me as we continue this journey. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you, my friend. Never think you cannot do something. Literally 3 months ago I was in the same mindset. I would choke on my words when trying to explain something or straight up concede my point out of fear of confrontation. It all starts with realizing that WE ARE DOING THE RIGHT THING. We are the ones pushing back against evil. We can do anything if we will it to be. Be strong. You have more potential than you could ever imagine.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>With the reality of our history comes the reality of our consciousness, spirituality, and divinity. The cultures that preceded the Younger Dryas cataclysm were highly advanced in that they were spiritually in tune with nature and the universe.

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s certainly a possibility but given the clues we have about their religious observations and the importance of spirituality, it stands to reason that the only class system they had may have been between spiritual leaders and the common people. Think one big tribe with &quot;shamans&quot; being given a bit a more authority. But relative to our culture, they had equality more or less.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Their religion was more akin to what we would call &quot;the science of consciousness.&quot; Nothing like what we think of as religion today. Not to say that it couldn&#39;t be a form of control, but I doubt it since it involved the use of hallucinogenics such as psilocybin and DMT.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, perhaps &quot;identical&quot; isn&#39;t the proper word. The point being that we haven&#39;t changed much biologically, though a change of mind happens often. </p>

<p>Also, I don&#39;t doubt that we once coexisted with other intelligent humanoids.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It doesn&#39;t take much genetic divergence to create a new species.  Divergence between humans and chimps/bonobos <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3814392/">is about 1-2%</a>.  Even between humans and <em>Mus musculus</em> the conservation is pretty high (I think 30% divergence if I remember correctly).</p>

<p>Still, whether it was <em>Homo sapiens</em> or red-haired giants (or something else), it&#39;s clear to me that there was a global civilization prior to 12000 years ago, and that this fact is intentionally being hidden from us.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Precisely. All of the species we find in the search for &quot;the missing link&quot; could very well have been somewhat intellectually equal to ourselves and coexisted peacefully. </p>

<p>I think that from approximately 130,000 years ago until 12,000 years ago, the series of changes in Earth&#39;s atmosphere and climate may have caused a great many of the more intelligent fauna to die off. Or perhaps some of our humanoid counterparts descended into the Earth or ascended into the heavens.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The symbols that have been found all over the world, including the flower of life, are actually related to physics.</p>

<p>If you use the omni-triangulated packing that the flower of life does, you can solve for quantum gravity.</p>

<p>Imagine instead of circles that they are spherical oscillators, vacuum fluctuations which are toroidal - planck length diamter spheres of the planck mass.</p>

<p>When you do this, and add up how many fit inside a proton volume (simply count the amount of planck length spheres in the proton and multiply by the planck mass) you get 10<sup>55</sup> grams.</p>

<p>This is the mass of the observable Universe.</p>

<p>If you then count the surface planck spheres and divide by the volume planck spheres, you solve for the rest mass of the proton.</p>

<p>So the proton is holographic, containing the mass information of all protons in the Universe, but only locally expresses a tiny slice - this has to do with the surface spheres being the terimation of a wormhole that entangles each proton with each other proton - this is a form of entropic gravity that has been making the rounds lately.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you, my friend. This is excellent information indeed. I will definitely find a way to tie it into my piece on symbology, though I many of the symbols I will be discussing are far more esoteric in nature. The realms of physics and science certainly play an indispensable role in our history and there are symbols and glyphs, as well as mathematics itself, encoded into every civilization I reference that prove that very fact. </p>

<p>I look forward to discussing this with you more once I post the installment on symbology. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d recommend checking out <a href="https://youtu.be/tbE5bVl8r2g">this talk by Nassim Haramein</a> in regards to explaining it in quite clear terms. At about 8 minutes in there&#39;s a bit where I like how he explains the perspective. He says &quot;the material world is actually an expression of what we call the spiritual world, and what we call spirituality is actually the physics we haven&#39;t quite understood yet.&quot; where spiritual simply refers to that which is present in the universe, yet immaterial and therefore unquantifiable and immeasurable in terms of mainstream material physics. Consciousness is a primary example of this, since we all experience consciousness and we can observe its effects, but we can&#39;t explain how or why it interacts with the material world the way it does with our current model of physics. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m going back to university because I&#39;m interested in how consciousness seems to interact with things, but there isn&#39;t enough scientific data published on the subject to satisfy my curiosity. So if nobody else has what I want, I might as well go out and find it myself. It&#39;ll take a long time, but the potential of finding what I&#39;m looking for, which I don&#39;t know exactly what that is right now, is worth the time and effort. </p>

<p>Also Australia, don&#39;t have to pay university fees until I have a job that pays a decent amount. So as long as I stay on minimum wage, I have free education. Which is what I&#39;ll be doing anyway since I&#39;m gonna be studying for a while. </p>

<p>On top of that, some of those buildings are huge for something made out of stone. Even further, those buildings have lasted thousands of years, some without any damage at all. If they were made out of steel or some other alloy they would be long gone.

    <div class="md"><p>I think there is a lot of interesting stuff to see in this area, but I&#39;m going to take issue with you on a couple of things... </p>

<p>First, did you make these imgur collections?</p>

<p>Your first link shows literally every kind of stone wall imaginable...</p>

<p>The Peruvian ones are interesting because of how the stones are shaped to perfectly fit together even though they are heterogeneous sizes and shapes. It practically makes my brain hurt with &quot;how&quot;s, &quot;why&quot;s etc..</p>

<p>Then the Egyptian ones are interesting because they are so precisely cut and angled, to fit together in perfect horizontal/vertical alignment. It looks hard to get that precision, but it&#39;s easier for me to imagine the motive and method...</p>

<p>But then these are mixed in with pics of completely non-fitting stone walls with huge gaps and uneven fits. Why?</p>

<p>Also, there really ought to be a caption for each, with <em>at least</em> the country stated. It&#39;s kinda frustrating to see something amazing, and not even know how to find out more about it, <em>especially</em> if your claim is that similar style occurred in disparate parts of the world.</p>

<p>The third link, with the doorways/arches, at least has that (country). But for anyone who&#39;s been following this story for more than a couple of days, some of those &quot;Peru&quot; pictures are clearly Bolivia (Pumapunka, Tiwanaku). Pretty shoddy work, whoever put the pics together.</p>

<p>Okay, I&#39;ll look at more, but those are my gripes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First off, yes, I made the imgur albums and there are labels of each country in the bottom left. And yes, I apologize for mixing Puma Punku and Tiwanku together. I was trying to go off general area rather than modern borders, mainly for the sake of time. I threw this thing together pretty quickly. My larger point being that, yes, I can assure you that these cites appear on multiple different continents, separated by oceans. </p>

<p>As for the more derelict sites, I referenced the cataclysm that occurred around 12,000 years ago that ushered in great flooding. This is why many of the cites appear to have been ravaged and shifted out of place. Many of the once pristine fittings became separated and later cultures attempted to repurpose them by filling in those crack with debris and smaller rubble.</p>

<p>I specifically said your first imgur link. I looked again and I see no countries listed there. Are you sure?</p>

<blockquote>

<p>If you mixed them together you still would have said Bolivia. Puma Punku is <em>in</em> Tiwanaku and neither is in Peru.</p>

<p>I get that the culture we&#39;re talking about is pre modern borders but I think it&#39;s still a better idea to use modern borders so people can follow up more easily.... Online or in person.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well I&#39;ll be damned. Thank you for catching my mistake, I will correct it as soon as I can. I suppose my haste got the better of me. My mind tends to lump Machu Picchu, Sacsayhuaman, Puma Punku, and Tiwanaku together due to their similarities.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Quite naturally. They are believed to be the same peoples-- or <em>at least</em> traded and shared knowledge.</p>

<p>I&#39;m trying to think of a better word so we don&#39;t appear to separate them via modern nation-state borders, but there is another problem with that: if you call them Incas you are buying into the theory that all these constructions were made in the last 1000 years (that&#39;s commonly thought of as the Inca period, 1000AD - 1400AD or so)...</p>

<p>But many people believe that the Inca&#39;s contribution was the rougher, smaller-stone constructions you see on top of or next to the megalith ones, and that the big crazy precise stuff could be older or MUCH older...</p>

<p>So I guess the most accurate phrase would be &quot;Inca or Pre-Inca&quot; but that&#39;s a mouthful.</p>

<p>One question, while you caption the first set. What is the first pic in the first set. Looks like it could be Cuzco or Sacsayhuaman but I don&#39;t recall seeing it.</p>

<p>AND HOLY SHIT. Our minds must have linked up on the energy grid! I am with you 100 percent when it comes to the ruins in the Andes and Bolivian highlands. The smaller stones we see built right over the megalithic ones were most certainly the Incas building over the &quot;pre-incas.&quot; I just like to call them the Andes civilization.</p>

<p>And I KNOW RIGHT, it looks exactly like Sacsayhuaman and Machu Picchu! But guess where it is? Fucking JAPAN!</p>

<p>I&#39;ll do a full re-upload of all the photos when I have more time. Thanks for noticing and making the correction, my friend.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Depends on what material&#39;s they use. If it&#39;s a structure reinforced with wood, the wood will probably rot and it&#39;ll be unstable. If it&#39;s made out of a weak soft stone like limestone, it&#39;ll almost definitely erode (see the Sphinx). But granite structures, especially ones covered by foliage/natural cover will almost certainly keep their smooth exteriors or carvings at the least.

    <div class="md"><p>I think the reason that there was so many large stone structures back then is because of the world wide devastation. </p>

<p>I think it correlates with Graham Hancocks theory that a comet hit the North American ice shelf vaporizing most of it and causing the worlds oceans to rise 400 feet. His theory also speculates that the vaporizing of the glacier forced massive amounts of moisture into the atmosphere causing world wide torrential rains for weeks straight. then about 600 years later earth was hit with another comet. Not causing as much destruction, but having a worldwide impact.</p>

<p>If you as a civilization had to deal with such devastation, what better way to protect yourselves then building massive structures able to withstand the devastation. I would almost guess some of these mega sites may have been a form of shelter house in the event that a disaster hit. This might explain why some where quickly abandoned. Maybe they had fulfilled their purpose.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s no reason to be skeptical though. For most of the work even stone tools would have sufficed.  The smooth surface&#39;s you talk about such as the limestone covering of the Khufu pyramid, or the mass production of stone blocks/bricks isn&#39;t what would be hard, rather the small intricate carvings and details that Mayan&#39;s made. And the people doing those carvings would have been trained their entire life, thousands of hours of practice, just to make this stuff. That&#39;s why you&#39;ll only see stone-masonry after agriculture, because it allowed specialization, and why you&#39;ll see guilds or family professions. Most of the empires we see that built this stuff were massive, it&#39;s not that hard to see how specialization/time/money/slaves/etc could have done the job. </p>

<p>I think you are speaking from a uninformed viewpoint of not knowing how stone actually is formed. Stones like granite are laid down in layers. That is how they are formed. It is these layers that are broken up when the rock is quarried. </p>

<p>It also means that rocks like granite also have cleavage planes and can be cut very precisely if you have an eye for the stone and know the technique to split it. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.cheops-pyramide.ch/khufu-pyramid/stone-cutting.html">The Egyptian were good at it</a>, but by no means were they the masters of it. But that does not mean other societies did not learn and refine the techniques or that the Egyptians were as limited as they were because they themselves copied someone else&#39;s work.</p>

<p>Stone masonry has a long tradition, very long. And their knowledge has always been somewhat coveted. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You hit on a few points that irk me in plenty of conversations. </p>

<p>One is when people are surprised that people so long ago could achieve a feat or write down such informed thoughts. I immediately think about how egotistical one has to be to think that we, now, all of the sudden became intelligent beings and that our ancestors must all have been knuckle dragging dummies. </p>

<p>Second is when people site our current society, use of the earth, and connection between our minds and its possibilities and say that we are at some sort of pinnacle. When I can look into our documented past and see people and societies that are closer to positive than we are. Much less our undocumented past. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>To me, god is a physical process; an energy force like electromagnetism or gravity. All life originates from this force. This force is conscious itself and it is the origin of consciousness elsewhere in the Universe. Life in the 3rd dimension is confined to a physical form and it is bound to the spatial and temporal properties of this dimension. The energy that is consciousness, mind, can separate from body and is not bound to any of the 12+ dimensional planes. I am god. You are god. When we die, mind leaves body and either moves into physical form or ascends dimensions to rejoin the unified energy from which it originates.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Those who win the war write the history. So its not like we dont &quot;know&quot; that history is botched. We just have no evidence/very little evidence from the past as victors often destroyed libraries and records etc. </p>

<p>Egypt had papyrus, hey are very proud of it, so there must have been libraries of the stuff. Records of the empire. Gone. By whose hand? What got destroyed. Without the record of it being there we wont know what it is that we are missing. </p>

<p>It isnt as much of a cover up as it is the basis of our civilization now. Information is power, wealth is a good basis, but without knowledge gold is as good as dust. Prior the wealthy rulers kept the flow of information and knowledge. But now we can all be educated. Just go to the library, (even though at this time many university level books are paywalled, the earlier editions can be found for free) hence the higher tier of information. History isnt as important as current state of mass misinformation and confusion. Those how have the information and knowledge and are able to utilise it benefit from it. But we cant be too smart or its hard to control us. Free thought, vs established ideologies, thats why internet is such a black hole as it opens anyone to share truth and fiction. </p>

<p>My theory as to why the history that we know today is so limited is to hide us from the truth for our own sakes. For the power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely. Lucky for us our little brains cant hold all information at once. Unlucky for us, google has become an advertising agency and the websearch suck balls now. ( googled smartwatches  video watching first 3 pages refers to youtube and android wear, no links to forum posts or articles on video playback of smart watches etc). So there is an attempt by corporations at least to once again to get a hold back on information to sustain economic control. Do school teach programming, they should, we have tech all around us, but no knowledge how to manipulate it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>if you guys haven&#39;t heard the name Al-Maqrizi you should google him.. his an Arab historian from the 1300 century, traveling around Egypt and documenting the story&#39;s of the people at that time..he has a lot on the pyramids </p>

<p>this is what he says about who,why and when the pyramids where built </p>

<p>&quot; the great pyramid was built by king surid, 300 years before the great flood.to preserve ancient knowledge,341 generations ago&quot;.. and he wrote this down some time in the late 1300 century </p>

    <div class="md"><p>In my opinion, I think simulation isn&#39;t the best word - it is misleading, as a lot of newer conspiracy people think it means like a computer program.</p>

<p>What it really is, is they tricked a huge portion of the population to live docile and unwittingly subordinative by programming everybody with false religion, movies, tv, commandeered government, false idols ect.</p>

<p>Satanists=Luciferians=sun worshippers, all just means that they worship the intellect of mankind; the second birth of awareness - they believe they are conscious, and they rule to maintain their knowledge over the masses by any means necessary.</p>

<p>However, I would argue that by creating this false reality for the masses of a world where we abhor violence and degeneracy, they inadvertently actually made us better people - we are communal, we have strong family structure, we pursue skills and achievement, we help each other - so when the day comes that we rid ourselves of their bonds, it will be 1000x harder for them to pull anything like this off ever again</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I disagree. If anything the system they have created glorifies violence and evil as long as it isn&#39;t apparent. We trick ourselves into justifying egregious acts of inhumanity because we don&#39;t have to stare it in the face. It&#39;s in someone else&#39;s backyard, not mine. We like to think we help each other but we don&#39;t. For instance, this is anecdotal but I believes it applies to the majority, I will in an accident while riding my moped in downtown San Francisco traffic and not a single person stopped, or even asked from their inside their vehicle if I was alright. The only person who came to my aid was a homeless man. They have tricked us into thinking we are a community, that we care, that we have morals, when we most certainly do not.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would argue that the society that they created for us is ruthless and people don&#39;t stop, not necessarily because they don&#39;t care (though I believe human nature is attracted to violence for primal reasons), but because if you stop, you will be late for work, and businesses are under a crunch and employees are treated as expendable - people dont have enough free time.  You work 8-12 hours a day, sit in 2 hours of traffic, spend a little time with your kids, get ready for the next day, and then youre lucky if you get 6-8 hrs of sleep.</p>

<p>Stopping for somebody could literally mean the difference of you losing your job with no recourse.  I know i am being slightly hyperbolic, but there is definitely a sense of urgency everywhere you go whatever you do in my part of the country, and it sucks.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m a conservative Christian. Recorded history in the bible following Adam&#39;s lineage gets you about 6k years. I also believe the earth is flat. I know that makes me unpopular or even stupid according to most people but I don&#39;t care. All of this &quot;science&quot; was taught by someone in a position of authority. No one has ever observed billions of years pass by. Most people have never even questioned their own beliefs. That&#39;s not science. Science is what we can observe and measure. Its all conjecture.</p>

<p>I read about one case where someone sent human remains to a lab to be dated using the accepted methods. The catch was that they knew when this person had died. It was less than 100 years ago. Why oh why did the lab give a date of over 10k years? It&#39;s ludicrous.</p>

<p>No one has ever observed evolution or the big bang but most people take it as fact. Popular science, with all its blatant lies and indoctrination, has become the people&#39;s new religion. I bet science textbooks didn&#39;t tell you that Charles Darwin thought black people were closer to apes. I prefer the biblical narrative saying we&#39;re all descendants of Noah. Hi cousin!</p>

<p>The ancient Romans recorded events. We have proof they fought giants. There are even records that suggest that giants lived amongst them. The records are so detailed that they even tell how much wine they drank. Other cultures have records of &quot;dragons&quot; aka dinosaurs. And some of the oldest cultures have records of speaking to serpent people that they called their gods.</p>

<p>The bible confirms all of this is true. Time and time again people attempt to disprove the bible only to learn that it is true.</p>

<p>I can go verse by verse and show you where it documents reptilians and then support that argument using archeological finds.</p>

<p>The thing is that most people don&#39;t want to believe that there is an all-powerful creator. Believing that there is no judge above man makes us comfortable as our society slides deeper and deeper into debauchery.</p>

<p>That&#39;s exactly what I&#39;ve done. Over the course of many years and reviewing evidence from various sources I&#39;ve reached my own conclusions. At least I have the balls to talk about it. </p>

<p>So what&#39;s your point? You disagree with what I wrote so you called me a lunatic. I&#39;ve heard it before lol. Are you going to make a counter argument? Have something to prove? Give me a break, dude.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>After all these hectic years and months that passed, i have drawn a conclusion: The day we will stop being partisans, limited by physical and thought borders, focused on who&#39;s better, the day that we will be united and helpers of evolution , that is the day that we will evolve, together in the true sense of the word, we will advance in everything by leaps and bounds, we will have a true liberty, not the illusory one that is shown to us now.
 Don<code>t get me wrong , it will be a tug of war fight on two fronts: With us and the ones that enslave us.
 Be strong and stay true to yourselves, we are all citizens and inhabitants of this beautiful Planet, which we don</code>t deserve, yet. Thousands of years from now i hope some of my descendants will look back and will say: We were lucky they fought.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>if I remember well, Atlantis was the Minoan civilization, that was around 1500 bc. And there is an ancient civilization in Anatolia called Hittites, they also liked building big, their capital was like how you mention in the OP, built in a very remote location, very hard accessible, grand stones melded together without mortar. They were an empire about the same time Ramses the Great lived. But some time later, something happened, plague, famine, because the empire fell into despair and the capital was abandoned. It remained buried for milenia, until was rediscovered 20 or so years ago. And the stone work is very similar to what you showed earlier. Couldn&#39;t it be possible that maybe, something like this happened to all those building you showed? Is more plausible than the theory you want to put out. Also, there is real proof that the Carthaginians could build block of flat (something like it) for up to 7 levels. They had pluming and everything we have today. Also, you should look up the ancient city that was discovered on Thera island and look at the way they were building things. Very interesting stuff. Practically, this city had pluming even back than, around 4000 years ago...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The first historical mention of Atlantis comes from Plato&#39;s tale of the sunken civilization. Plato said that the civilization disappeared into the ocean between 9,000-10,000 years ago. Plato lived between 400-300 BC, so that puts his date for Atlantis right around 12,000 years ago. Atlantis is almost certainly the Atlantic Ocean counterpart to the ancient island Mu in the Pacific Ocean. Before the meteor impacts, change in climate, and subsequent sea level rise of about 125-150 meters, thousands of miles of coastline was exposed and connecting island chains to our current continental structure. Once the sea level rose around after the cataclysm 12,000 years ago, these civilizations were lost. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve read Plato&#39;s tale and it seems plausible. The only thing that I question is his time calculations. 900 years earlier is what I think is the right time frame for Atlantis destruction, around the same time the island of Thera in the Aegean Sea was destroyed in a volcanic explosion. Also, around the same time the Minoans civilization started to fall apart... anyway, each with their believes and conclusions... also, I&#39;m not trying to fuck up your theory, just that, what you suggest is a theory that has been discussed before in the archeological circles. This theory started when Arthur Posnansky discovered Tiwanaku and believed to be an astronomical site, did some calculations and came up with a archeological site 15,000 years old. Years later, it was proved that the site wasn&#39;t older than 2000 years...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, to each their own. And like I said in the OP, I give no credence to anything perpetuated by mainstream archaeology, history, or academia in general. They have not only been proven wrong, but they have been proven to fabricate information, as well as blatantly lie. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>m8, there are things that the mainstream archaeology got right, and things that they&#39;ve got it wrong. The wrong theories had been adjusted to the new proofs, or discarded. (this 10 15 thousand years old global civilization theory is among those that had been discarded because the proofs are very scarce) That&#39;s how mainstream archaeology works. </p>

<p>And what I said about Atlantis is the conclusions I&#39;ve arrived after reading a lot about the subject (history has been a hobby of mine all my life, and couldn&#39;t stay away from Atlantis) This conclusion it&#39;s my own. I also believed at one point that Atlantis was 10 12 thousand years old, but later, I found out some other things that just don&#39;t add up to that number.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The main motivation is that we have been systematically lied to by the very people we have entrusted with authority. If it were to become common knowledge that our history is, in fact, wildly different than what we have been led to believe, then it could change the entire structure of power and control in modern society given that enough people are willing to do something about it.

    <div class="md"><p>If modern society knew that mankind had reached peaks similar to the enlightenment period multiple times in the last 200k years that were all catastrophically destroyed by a comet or something we would finally have a common enemy to bring us together as humans as opposed to as citizens. </p>

<p>If we make a comprehensive comet defense system we would be doing an incredibly positive (and perhaps transcendent) act for the biome on earth which has been wrecked by events that make the cold war nuclear arsenal look like a firecracker countless times before. If humans could end this omnipresent threat of cosmic impact I believe we would trully have done our work for the next step of whatever the universe is working towards.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I should add that I&#39;ve studied under a top 15 paleoindian researcher a step down from Vance Haynes and Co. Even they don&#39;t have the answers to the arrival of the first Native Americans. The timeline just doesn&#39;t add up. We see spruce wood radiocarbon dated from near the Algona moraine in the Woden Bog located in northern Iowa which dates from 12,600 BP. Anzick was dated to 12,500-12,600 BP. Although the glaciers were advancing during the Bolling Allerod, it would have been treacherous as hell to get down the ice free corridor. We see huge, thick loess deposits outside the Des Moines lobe, so the weather conditions during them are unlike we&#39;ve seen anything today. To think they were migrating during such hostile weather conditions is impossible I believe. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mostly believe that a small group of people became &#39;conscious&#39; before others, through intellect.  And they began to herd the others by concealing their intellect (use of hand tools and weapons, originally), disinformation, violence, division and oppression, because that is how they believed you maintained order and created a society.  Thus, they worship &#39;intellect&#39;, the sun-Satan-Lucifer-Osiris-Horus, I believe are all just symbols for this (the lay person language is a barrier here, because we hear these words and immediately think of a scaly red demon).</p>

<p>I think they passed this order on throughout time, and the playbook hasn&#39;t really changed much.  </p>

<p>But, I believe that there is a force working against them, too.  A force that believes everybody can be &#39;illuminated&#39; and society will still function, perhaps even moreso.  These were people like Plato, Leibniz and most notably, Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>Call these two forces &#39;good&#39; and &#39;evil&#39;, I reckon that is up to debate - personally, i consider deception to be &#39;evil&#39;; but I wouldn&#39;t submit that there is a higher deity directing them to be like this - I think it is human nature gone totally extremes. A deity could have impregnanted those tendencies into us, perhaps- but id rather get rid of these folks first, and then figure out our true cosmic origins after, unless of course discovering our cosmic origins will help us get rid of these folks</p>

    <div class="md"><p>:) Like I said, this will be a large theme in the coming installments. The war between all life in the universe, good and evil, has been waged since the beginning of time and the division of dimensions. As Agent Smith said, &quot;It is the purpose that created us, connects us, pulls us, drives us, guides us, binds us...&quot; This versus that, Us versus Them, Gods versus Titans, Yahweh versus Satan, Good versus Evil. It is the only rhyme and reason to creation and has been present since creation itself.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s the groundless belief that no other civilizations as advanced as our own, (let alone more advanced in various and completely different ways), could possibly have preceded it, that lacks the necessary facts and evidence to back it up, not the other way around.</p>

<p>I&#39;d highly recommend checking out the New Earth Channel and the works of Silvie Ivanowa who&#39;s really done a remarkable job of piling up evidence of an ancient past all that flies in the face and unequivocally refutes that erroneous belief.  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/everhungriescatgang">https://www.youtube.com/user/everhungriescatgang</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting. But not actually that far fetched. If you subscribe to the genome evidence that <a href="http://content.usatoday.com/communities/sciencefair/post/2011/07/once-only-1000-humans-in-asia-europe-/1">about 30,000 years ago there were only a couple of 1000 humans in existence.</a></p>

<p>That would me a rebuilding of civilization could well have stemmed from the relatively small pool of innovation that got passed around.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Free Masonry. Babylonian Talmudism. Kaballah. </p>

<p>Free Masonry as a &quot;secret society&quot; is really just a front for the practice of Kaballism...&quot;Jewish Mysticism...which is Babylonian Talmudism. </p>

<p>Christ proclaimed himself to be the Messiah of the Tribes of Israel, yet the Pharisees and the Scribes denied him. </p>

<p>Set aside your feelings about organized religion and just read the words of Christ and, for that matter, the words of Mohammad as well. </p>

<p>The message must always be viewed separately from the institutions built up around them, as institutions are created by man and, thus, are imperfect and fallible. </p>

<p>When you read the message of Christ, who other than those serving &#39;the fallen ones&#39; would reject such a message?</p>

<p>Jesus of Nazareth was a Jew. </p>

<p>Those who follow him, while they may call themselves Christians, are the true Jews...the true Tribes of Israel...who now just go by a different name. </p>

<p>Those who claim to be Jews in the modern era?</p>

<p>The Ashkenazi, which comprise 80% of modern Judaism, only emerged in 1500s Eastern Europe. Their genealogy is traced back to &lt;100 individuals and their bloodline is a &lt;10% match to the Abrahamic bloodlines. </p>

<p>Do you know whose bloodline is a &gt;80% match to the Abrahamic bloodlines? </p>

<p>Palestinians. </p>

<p>....it&#39;s almost like a nation state exists as a base for Free Masonry and wants to exterminate all Palestinians before the rest of the world wakes up and gets wise to the fact that Ashkenazi Jews are imposters and that the TRUE tribes of Israel are the other ~6.7 billion of us on this planet who identify as neither Ashkenazi or Sephardic. </p>

<p>Seriously, wake up.</p>

<p>Modern Judaism = Babylonian Talmudism = The Worship of Lucifer / Satan / Baal / Moloch and power obtained via dark magic granted through blood sacrifice. </p>

<p>True Judaism, as in the tribes of Israel, = THE REST OF THE GOD DAMN WORLD!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great post. I have been thinking the same thing for a while now. I intuitively believe that ancient human civilizations were way more advanced and we&#39;re at harmony with the Earth. They knew how to harness the earth power, namely geomagnetism, to create these unbelievable structures. Some of those stone cuts cannot be recreated today. The inside 90 degree angle cuts, the drill holes etc are completely impossible with what mainstream archeologists say they used as tools. I agree that it is an insult to our intelligence and idk how this hadn&#39;t been questioned more.... Anyway, I love these kinds of posts and can&#39;t wait for the next one. You should consider doing YouTube videos. I would def subscribe and watch</p>

    <div class="md"><p>m8, there are things that the mainstream archaeology got right, and things that they&#39;ve got it wrong. The wrong theories had been adjusted to the new proofs, or discarded. (this 10 15 thousand years old global civilization theory is among those that had been discarded because the proofs are very scarce) That&#39;s how mainstream archaeology works. </p>

<p>And what I said about Atlantis is the conclusions I&#39;ve arrived after reading a lot about the subject (history has been a hobby of mine all my life, and couldn&#39;t stay away from Atlantis) This conclusion it&#39;s my own. I also believed at one point that Atlantis was 10 12 thousand years old, but later, I found out some other things that just don&#39;t add up to that number.  </p>

<p>One is when people are surprised that people so long ago could achieve a feat or write down such informed thoughts. I immediately think about how egotistical one has to be to think that we, now, all of the sudden became intelligent beings and that our ancestors must all have been knuckle dragging dummies. </p>

<p>Second is when people site our current society, use of the earth, and connection between our minds and its possibilities and say that we are at some sort of pinnacle. When I can look into our documented past and see people and societies that are closer to positive than we are. Much less our undocumented past. </p>
