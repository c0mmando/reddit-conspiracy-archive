       Pretty obvious us Flat Earthers are under fire. Just look at the anti-FE posts the past few days. Someone really wants to denegrate this idea.
      </p>
      <p>
       My favorite part is how it's claimed that FE is somehow a psy-op lmaooooooo. The literature supporting it has been around a lot longer than some silly psy-op, nevermind the fact that this psy-op claim is backed up with zero evidence. They just keep saying "it's a psy-op hurhur!"
      </p>
      <p>
       Look I am done trying spread the word on FE. It is just very interesting to see it get "mocked and ridiculed". It's so brigaded that it should be leant more credence.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also a hearty Fuck You to anyone calling people stupid for questioning the obvious bullshit narrative. I can't wait to see you all on the way to Mars /s.

       I feel like Hollow Earth and Flat Earth could have some weird overlap. There are so many stories that there must be something to it. It makes me imagine something like a Mt. Meru that connects different "worlds".

       Personally, I think there is a lot more credibility to hollow earth than flat earth. It's interesting that with so much attention on Antartica lately, flat earth theory has been brought up continuously by celebrities, yet I haven't heard one speak of a hollow earth. This is where the phsy op lies I think

       The is no psy-op, at least I don't see any actual evidence that there is some department somehow dedicated to proliferating it. FE movement is organic, and it really rests on the lack of credible evidence of a round Earth. People have caught on to the ball-earth lie. The evidence just doesn't add up. Hollow Earth evidence is pretty scant, but I wouldn't discount it. I don't know how the these different lands connect, but they seem to exist in plenty of stories. Hollow Earth is a part of it, whether it's technically hollow or not.

       100% serious. You cannot show any real proof that the earth is round. And in a very real way you can track the lie as it evolved. A Trip To The Moon came out in 1902 lol so well before anyone could even guess that it would be possible. It has been thrust on our minds, we are basically forced to believe the Earth is round.
      </p>
      <p>
       And look if you have some proof that doesn't require me to 'just believe some scientist' then I am all ears.
      </p>
      <p>
       The round earth lies are hilarious at this point. Some Indian rocket supposedly carried over 100 sats into orbit hahaha of course no video of this monumental occasion. Also I look at the Cassini images as they come in from Saturn(they must have a gigantic radio tower on that sat to be able to send data back that far lmaoooo) and the pics look so stupid. Really man it's time to face up to the charade.

       Number 1. How do satellites orbit a flat earth ? Do you deny satellites exist also. Bearing in mind you're probably typing these comments on a mobile phone ? 
Number 2. The fact that at many points on the earth you can actually see the curvature of the earth with your own eyes ? 
Number 3. How do you explain the fact the earth is flat but every other planet/ moon in our solar system is round. I also don't need scientists to tell me this as I have a telescope.
Number 4. If the earth was flat at some point on my round the world flight I would have to nose dive 90 degrees or risk flying off in to space ? 
Number 5. How do eclipses work the way they do if the earth were flat only a slit of light would be blocked ? 
There are many many more it's just a ridiculous idea I'm big into conspiracies and ME and all sorts but this one is just crazy I'm sorry but it just is.

         Satellites are fake AF. Perhaps you didn't realize that satellite TV has been around longer than satellites. That's because the dishes are all pointed at towers, hence why you never see a satellite dish pointed straight up like they would if they aimed at things in orbit.

         You cannot see a curve from anywhere on earth, and the higher you go the horizon line continues to rise with you eyes. I have flown many times, no curve up there.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Simple point of fact, no one truly knows what those things are. Your telescope can show you points of light that happen to be round and it is certainly not an indicator of what they are composed.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         You are making a great point that there should be gyro data from planes that support a round earth, yet there are not. In fact, many emergency plane landings expose a flat earth. You should check out emergency landings in Moscow. There are several, and their points of origin and ending do not make sense on a round earth. I have watched the tracking of planes over the southern hemisphere and they fall off tracking and then magically appear again at their destination.

         You are making weird assumptions that you can't back up with this. I don't know what an eclipse actually is, especially as there been eclipses recorded where a third body would be necessary.

        Not true there are many places you can see the curvature of the earth. If you want an easy way to see this I point you to the top gear episode I think it was in Germany. Then again top gear is probably in on it too.
       </li>
       <li>
        What sort of explanation is this haha that's just you admitting you're wrong and can't give an answer. I can see Jupiter very clearly and it's moons but I'm presuming they have been put there just to make us all think the earth is flat (you really can't be serious) ?
       </li>
       <li>
        Have you ever noticed planes fly up and across or down and across on their flight plan to follow the quickest route (also known as the curvature of the earth)
       </li>
       <li>
        I'm not making any assumptions that I can't back up I be seen it with my own eyes if the earth was flat an eclipse would not be possible. Have you noticed how the sun is flat too and the moon or are you saying as you said in point three just because we can see them doesn't mean they are round haha. If anyone needs to get out of their crazy bubble it's you pal.

       Think about it. A satellite is like 100s of miles away. There is no way you could see something that far away. That right there shows me you are not thinking clearly or critically. Do you just want to argue? And call me pal? lol don't be passive aggressive just say what you want to say lmao

       The international space station is hundreds of miles away I can see that. Stars are light years away I can see those. The sun is millions of miles away I can see that the moon is 250'000 miles away I can see that. The reason I can see them is because light from our "round sun" shines off the solar panels and body of the satellite witch then reflects to my eye. Or are you telling me the light from the sun is not strong enough to reach my eye ? Every single moon planet or star we have ever discovered or have seen with our own eyes is round fair enough a few moons have a strange shape but they certainly aren't flat. The fact is you can't give valid answers to my previous statements so you're not starting to get defensive and trying to draw me in to an argument so that you can dodge the truth. You are absolutely crazy pal.

       You are not seeing the ISS cause it's not up there. The ISS is the biggest joke ever. The one guy claimed to live up there for like a year hahaha! Just watch some of the ISS vids they come out with every week. They are painfully fake, with many obvious tells such as harnesses and what not.

       Yes you see stars, but you don't know how far away they are. The idea that you could see something a few trillion miles away is laughable.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact is you can't give valid answers to your own statements but you are so brainwashed that you are unwilling or unable to see it. You are the one continuing this so don't accuse me of starting an argument with you. It's all on you 'PAL' lmaooooooooooooooo

       So if it's not the ISS I see what is it you have all the answers? You can take a fucking picture of it you nut with a decent enough camera I suppose they are all fake though. "The fact you can see something trillions of miles away is laughable" do you actually understand how light works and how your eye interprets the light you really need to educate yourself good sir you are crazy. Have you had a look at the sun have you noticed how bright it is the sun is a relatively small star and it would still burn your eyes out if you stared at it for a couple of minutes that's how you can see something trillions of miles away not everything is powered by AA batteries unlike your brain.

       Do you actually understand how light works? Or did someone tell you.
      </p>
      <p>
       You make a great point with sun even when you didn't realize it. The is blinding when it is directly overhead, but when it is far away at 'sunset' you can look right at it. If it were 93 million miles away then the intensity would be the same level regardless of angle. But it is actually much closer hence the difference in brightness as it travels farther away.

       The atmosphere scatters a certain amount of sunlight. When the sun is near the horizon, its light is going through a geometrically thicker section of atmosphere, so more of it gets scattered before it reaches your eye. Go back to school pal.

       Any scientific answer you are given you know better. There is no talking to people like you. I'm presuming the whole of science is in on it too I'm pretty sure one astronomer or scientist at some point in the history of man kind would have said something if the earth was flat. Tell me this then what reason do people have to lie and say the earth is round and not flat if it is flat why would they need to do that also in still waiting for your proof the earth is flat cos I haven't seen any yet ?

       To keep people deceived about the true nature of reality. It's not that hard to imagine. They make stupid movies about this all the time. Divergent comes to mind.

       It's not my fault you can't see what is happening. And I understand your deep faith in science. But remember, science endorsed eugenics and lobotomies as well. You should research 'scientism'. It's kind of hard to find these days but it was a big subject decades ago and it should still be considered. Someone like you might believe anyone as long as they are wearing a labcoat.

       No completely agree we shouldn't accept everything because science isn't always completely correct we don't know everything. But this is just ridiculous we have so much proof of all the things you deny. The fact you tell me the ISS isn't up there is just laughable I can watch it with my own eyes every night. I don't need anyone to tell me something I can see with my own eyes.

       There's many, many fields of science. The medical aspect is more involved with eugenics and lobotomies. How they got the knowledge to perform such procedures was by human experimentation, which is completely irrelevant to the stupid flat earth bs.

       I'm also presuming all scientists and astronomers are in on it NASA all the private space companies are also in on it. All of the astronauts even the retired ones are still in on it. Every single documentary where people have used fighter jets to go up and see the curvature of the atmosphere. I'm presuming the weather is also in on it and the magnetic poles must also be in on it also the van Allen belts must be in on it too also the oceans must be in on it too. Go educate yourself instead of spewing bullshit that you've heard someone else say.

       Your idea of education is to spout of a bunch of bs that someone told you. You cannot verify any of the things you are desperately clinging to. You wanna keep fighting about it to. That tells me that you have cognitive dissonance. You need to let that feeling out and explore it because it is a strong signal. I could go all day without feelings so say whatever you want, but as you honestly research this subject you will start to see.

       lol You have no grounds to tell anyone they are suffering from cognitive dissonance when you have zero proof to back up your claims for flat earth. The only grounds you have to stand on is a fantasy thought process that is devoid of critical thinking.

       Do satellites have spotlights or can you see them at night because of moon reflection ?  I wonder how what I've thought were satellites at night could be seen with the naked eye....something the size of a bus 100+miles away at night.....I have questions.

       I cannot wrap my head at the amount of rejected science from Flat Earthers. A big component to their theory is that NASA is this entity that is fooling us into believing a globe so they can suck in billions of dollars. NASA's funding has been cut 75%. Plus the amount of funds it would actually take to cover up a globe lie...seriously. We're talking the entire education system, college, astrophysicist from every country, chemist, mathematicians, governments from every country...I mean everything.

       Satellites being fake? We can visibly see them pass over us, we can even see them more clearly if we had a telescope. Did they manufacture holographic lens into every single telescope made?

       Apparently according to this guy yes because "satellites are hundreds of miles away so you shouldn't be able to see them" we also shouldn't be able to see stars that are light years away he obviously has no understanding of actual science and if he does he likes to ignore it to support his crazy theories. I also struggle to understand how anyone can be this ignorant in the modern world but apparently there's quite a few. As you say pretty much every single person in the world must be in on it from ship captains to scientists to astronauts, Astronomers to the average joe using a backyard telescope anybody with anything about them can observe how the stars move across the year but then again they aren't stars because there is "no way you could see something trillions of miles away" it really is laughable.

       Apparently man. Some of the stars we see may not even actually be there because of how long the light takes to travel to the earth-for us Humans to see. I bought a telescope for my son so we can observe the moon. Just so happened that when I bought it, the ISS was flying by. Our local news station covered a bit during the times we could see it. You can visibly see it from the naked eye, but in the telescope it's really cool. But hey, my telescope is fake and what I saw was not real...or anyone in my area who has a telescope that post photos on facebook. We're all so indoctrinated with facts.

       No one knows what is on the 'under' side. And look I will call out denigration! You round-earthers basically have to choke down what NASA tells you. And if you examine it critically at all then you will know that NASA is fucking hogwash. That is the main driver in the resurgence of FE. People can see the obvious bullshit at NASA and ESA and Space-X and etc...

       According to flat earthers, there is an ice wall that surrounds the entire flat landscape of earth preventing anything from falling off. People aren't allowed to go to Antarctica because they may try to climb that wall and fall off the earth. That's what they believe.

       Personally, I do not want to be told to fuck off by either side.
      </p>
      <p>
       To date I cannot get a FE to lead me to a proof of the Toronto plaque. I cannot afford to go there nor do I have the equipment to do the test.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of all the
       <em>
        PROOFS
       </em>
       this simple one should utterly nail it down. That skyline is HUGE and only about 23-27(?) miles from the plaque yet I've failed to find a single FE go over there, perform the task and
       <strong>
        prove
       </strong>
       FE.
      </p>
      <p>
       On the same line, I've never seen a ball earther do like wise but the burden of proof is on FE.

       Why is the burden on FE? It must at least be equally on round-earth.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm looking into the 'Toronto plaque' now I have not heard about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you want one simple proof then I offer this:
      </p>
      <p>
       If the Earth is round and spinning then the rate of spin should be perceptible as in the closer you get to the equator the faster you are spinning and vice versa the closer you get to the north pole you will be spinning slower. As far as I know this hasn't been demonstrated.

       FE must endure the greater burden of

       This is like an ant saying well the world must be flat because this patio in this back garden I'm living in is flat and I cant perceive otherwise because I'm so small. Problem is humans are a little more advanced than ants and we have been to space which allows us to see the earth is flat. But hey let's just pretend we haven't been and call it all a big conspiracy.

       The favorite retort of any Glober is "how is x possible on a flat earth?" Typically x is some convoluted nonsense based on the junk science of heliocentrism. I stopped responding to these people.
      </p>
      <p>
       One thing I've been mulling over lately about FE, is when did it
       <em>
        really
       </em>
       become accepted by the masses? We know Copernicus and Galileo were laughed at and threatened by the Christian Church. It seems like the Church of England, after the Reformation was the first to teach it in the late 1600s. It's clear from all the  FE books around in the late 1800s that it was an idea with still quite a few detractors among writers, not to mention what the average rural person probably thought. Of course the invention of flight really forced the perpetrators of the Globe to kick it into to high gear in the 20th Century, and the post war period saw a frenetic period of IGY in 1958 followed by fake Space stuff which sealed the deal.  So it really isn't a 500 year old fraud as much as an 1800s on fraud, which puts it in the same time line as the other great scientific frauds: evolution, big bang, dinosaurs. Along with the spinning ball, these four beliefs constitute the modern nihilistic, disconnected, uprooted, easily manipulated human mindset of the 20th and 21st century

       We used to believe the earth was flat in the 1800's till we realised we could sail all the way round it without falling off the edge. There was no NASA then no global narrative no attempt to alter the public consciousness just the fact that we realised the earth wasn't flat because we didn't fall off the edge. It's not the Truman show ya know.

       I'm presuming what you're getting at is that every single voyage ever sailed has followed this path cos funnily enough I've never heard any reports of ships crashing in to giant ice walls. I'm also pretty sure someone would have reached the edge and gone all the way around it to prove it's there but unfortunately I don't see any proof.

       If you are in a speeding vehicle do you somehow "feel" that you are moving quickly? Without your eyes you wouldn't have a clue about how fast you are going. Humans do not have this mystery sense that you are suggesting that people are supposed to have.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you are in a speeding vehicle and the brakes are applied sharply what happens? The vehicle is slowed quickly but you are still moving forward. You are moving at the same speed as the car. If the car slows down too quickly you'll hit the windshield. Everyone who has ridden in a vehicle has experienced this effect to some extent.
      </p>
      <p>
       We are moving along with the Earth and everything else that is here with us on the Earth. Everything is moving together at the same speed. As you change location you will gradually increase or decrease your own speed to match where you are located.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's why nobody notices the effect you are looking for.

       There aren't any objects by which you can judge the speed against. The closest celestial object is the moon and it's too far away to get a decent visual sense using just your eyes.

       There aren't any objects by which you can judge the speed against. The closest celestial object is the moon and it's too far away to get a decent visual sense using just your eyes.

       The daylight at the poles is variable through the seasons. During some periods of time there is much longer days than at the equator and conversely there are periods of time when there are much shorter days.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is an observable phenomenon that is very very well documented.

       It's not like they can actually produce any evidence. All they got is anecdotal observations being done by people who have little or no scientific training.

       Yeah my bad bud. I'm big into conspiracies and ME and ufo's and such and I'm certainly a sceptic when it comes to the governments telling us the truth but this one is just a little silly. When we point him toward the scientific proof to argue against his point all he does is tell us they're all in on it too that's not proof that's called denial.

       Agreed...
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm typically the skeptic as well. Obviously, there are plenty of real conspiracies and other mysteries. However, there are plenty of hoaxes out there. Unfortunately too many people will just accept something at face value and believe it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think it's something about human nature. We assume that other people are similar to ourselves. Most people wouldn't make something up just to fuck with people on the Internet. Therefore we find it difficult to believe that someone would just make up a story no matter how outlandish it is.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another reason is the lack of real scientific understanding. People who don't understand science very well are more likely to believe something that doesn't make sense.
      </p>
      <p>
       The ones that really get under my skin are the YouTube videos that try to make a big deal out of a tiny observation and try to claim that the whole event was staged. Usually, it's something like blood doesn't flow that way.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most people are comparing what they're seeking against what they've seen in movies. Special effects don't necessarily match what happens in real life. Special effects are more of an artists creation of what they are trying to show. Often times it's exaggerated for effect. Real flesh behaves differently.

       Yeah completely agree. I saw one the other day about how the Boston bombing was fake. It was ridiculous not that I don't believe in false flag operations because I do it was just how crazy the reasons they were using to justify what they were saying. They made no sense at all. People need to educate their selves.

       Again, people are accepting that the people making the video are being honest. They don't stop to think that YouTube is a good way to make money. All you need to do is have videos that people watch. Seems obvious to me that it's the YouTube video that is fake not the other way around.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm on board with 911 being a conspiracy. I even believe that it's quite possible that they baited Japan into Pearl Harbor. Any time the Government needs to get the public behind a particular decision they can count on a mass casually event to get most everyone to accept it.

       You hit the nail on the head 9/11 and pearl harbour are the two I am inclined to believe. But only because the reasons for them are entirely plausible. In both events America needed a reason to get involved I hope that 9/11 wasn't a false flag but I also wouldn't put it past the government. The public conscience sometimes needs to be altered and something like 9/11 is a sure fire way to do it.

       Any "literature" supporting such an antiquated idea must be found in the fiction section.
      </p>

       I can't imagine how any educated and reasonably modern person could believe such an idea.

      <p>
       Modern aircraft and ships circumnavigate the World routinely.
      </p>
      <p>
       People on boats noticed a long time ago that you can't see all of a boat if it's a long distance away. You'll see the top of the mast but the rest of the boat is below the horizon. As you move closer you gradually see more of the mast until you are close enough to see the whole ship.

       Satellites and GPS are based on the spherical Earth.

       The rounded shadow of the Earth can be seen during a lunar eclipse if you take enough images of the event.

       There is also a mountain of scientific evidence from various disciplines that support the spherical Earth.

      <p>
       We also have expert testamony on the subject. For example the thread from earlier today where a surveyor was debunking the conspiracy theory about the flat Earth.

       Sure I do. I have presented a lot in this post. There is a metric fuckton more if you are honestly looking for it. But you just want to believe what you want to so what are we even doing at this point. Go be happy, live life. Try and be nice. It's already clear that you can't fathom this one.

       Yeah show me one picture of flat earth. Show me your proof the ISS isn't there show me your proof there are no satellites. If you can prove science wrong I will believe you. Nothing you have said even comes close to actually proving science wrong that is your issue. You tell everyone how wrong we are for believing what we actually see but then have zero proof of what you're trying to tell us. Prove I shouldn't be able to see stars or the moon. The fact you don't think we should be able to see a star from light years away is absolutely absurd.

       He doesn't survey long distances, he does sewer pipes upto 3 miles. Earth's curvature would matter as much at that length as it would matter to someone building a 60 Foot trailer, it doesn't.

       Thing is there has been location radar that is as good as 'gps' for a long time before 'satellites'. All gps is run by towers. Satellites make zero sense anyway. What is maintaining there speed? Or do they magically avoid physics. How can they have course correction? It goes on and on. How come we can't get a picture of a satellite taken by another satellite? There should be thousands upon thousands of them. I could go on and on...

       An object in motion stays in motion, unless acted upon by an outside force. Space is a vacuum, so outside of collisions with micro meteorites or controlled thruster burns, there isn't anything to act on the motion of satellites.

       Here's one I deal with all the time. I'm an OTR truck driver. It's a pretty common trip for me to travel from California to New Jersey and back. Typically a round trip takes me about 9 to 12 days depending on how much time I spend at the destination and the path I take for the return trip.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the Earth is flat how is it that the sun rises and sets at different times at different locations? I lose or gain 3 hours depending on the direction of travel. I keep my logs on California time and each trip I can clearly see the difference as I travel across the country.
      </p>
      <p>
       How does this happen if the Earth is flat?

       I watched a few flat earth videos with an open mind and i must say, the arguments that some posters presented were embarasing to say the least. The phenomena which they said is proof for a flat earth is quite literally the opposite. For example there was this guy who watched tree shadows from a plane and said that all the shadows should be lined equally and because they are not (in his opinion), that proves that the sun is much closer to the earth than we think. However this guy obviously has zero clue about how perspective works. After that i couldnt take anything else he said seriously. There was an other guy who interpreted flight paths and he ibviously didnt take into account the smaller volume of the earth at the top, so he concluded how flight paths dont make sense on a spherical earth. He just look stupid from there onward. Then there was a guy who actually said that how do planes moves if they travel counter to rotation of the earth, he tought that obviously planes would stay in same position because of that. After that i couldnt take the fe theorists seriously.
      </p>
      <p>
       So OP please provide me with some decent videos because this is something i want to explore. I was huge into hollow earth and i wanted to examine fe theory in the same way. I always look for the physics perspective and so far fe explanations lacked heavily in that regard.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bottom line, even if you are a smart guy and a proponent of this theory, you have some reaaaaally dumb people on your side, dragging the theory into the ground.

       It's been said before. I just don't get the hate. People claim "it's stuff like this that's damaging society" or some other really far stretching reason why it bothers them so much.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you believe that someone is dumb and they are wrong, does it make more sense than to just let them think it or devote your time and energy into berating them.

       It being a psyop is a whole other argument. I'm not a dumb person but I also don't hold a side on the FE debate.

       Your idea of education is to spout of a bunch of bs that someone told you. You cannot verify any of the things you are desperately clinging to. You wanna keep fighting about it to. That tells me that you have cognitive dissonance. You need to let that feeling out and explore it because it is a strong signal. I could go all day without feelings so say whatever you want, but as you honestly research this subject you will start to see.

       So pretty much the vast majority of people are "in on the conspiracy" and we're all making this up to fool the 4 or 5 people on the planet who are FE?

       I'm trying to figure out why there's a plaque across from the Toronto Skyline that says the proof of curvature can clearly be seen from that spot. Of all that places that any FE or GE could go to prove this one way or another I would think that spot is ideal...right?
