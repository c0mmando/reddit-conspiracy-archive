<p>It states that, according to <em>their</em> agenda, the plan is to destroy religion to have people believe in science.</p>

<p>My question is, why would that be such a bad thing? Don&#39;t get me wrong, the rest of the protocols are complete Zionist/elitist views that are really harsh but seem to be true and manifesting before our very eyes.</p>

That is not to say that it is untrue, it&#39;s just that&#39;s it&#39;s a doctrine of shared understandings. A more complete truth about a subject would be to not only incorporate the tangible but stay open minded about the things we don&#39;t yet understand. Our knowledge about our reality is the size of a sand pebble in the Sahara. Science can hold us back because the egos of Scientists won&#39;t allow for new information that contradicts previous held assumptions. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s actually very strong proof. Why would someone chronicling the supposed meetings blatantly steal from an earlier book if it wasn&#39;t fabricated? There&#39;s lots of inconsistencies that came along with this, like how the protocols call upon jews to remember the french revolution as an example of how great they were at manipulating the entire thing, while jews at that time had little to no part in the revolution. The old testament is quoted in latin, not Yiddish or Hebrew. The list goes on. </p>

<p>same with the protocols being &#39;jewish&#39;, mentioning several books in the talmud that actually do not exist. maybe they were writen by jews, but they are not in any way related to jewish religion.</p>

<p>this is not to say that there isn&#39;t an incredible amount of jews involved in the nwo, but they are not religious, nor does it have anything to do with religion. only in the sense that all top members of organized religion actually pervert the very roots of the religion they purport to uphold (see: orthodox jews who support israel, the vatican, wahabism, etc).</p>

<p>the jewish question is not as simple as most people postulate. there are many religious jews who oppose Israel (see: naturei karta), and there are many non-religious jews who contributed a great deal to freedom (Mises, Rothbard, Friedman).</p>

<p>Then why is it only religious people that seem to realize Communism and Islam are evil? The moral-less Priests of Scientist and Cultural Marxists think we should respect their culture diversity and let them destroy Western civilization. Of course, any religion can become dogmatic and bad. But, as Nietsche proved, when there is no religion to ideologically solidify the people together, then there is only two results: Master Morality (Every man for himself, eugenics, Hitler) and Slave Morality (Everyone must be equal, political correctness, Gulag Archipelago). </p>

<p>Religion plays a vitally necessary role in human evolution because people evolve in groups. Why do think there isn&#39;t any 2000 year old Atheist groups? Christianity is 2000 years old. Hinduism could be 10,000 years old. Atheism breeds lonerism and countries full of loners get stomped by Islam (see Sweden and Germany).</p>

<p>Our Founding Fathers hated organized religion but still believed in God. All the same arguments for Atheism existed then as do today (there is no argument for Atheism that wasn&#39;t made by Hume). Do you know why they still believed in God while they said they hated religion and the Church? It&#39;s kind of important to the Philosophic foundation of the country but all the atheists I meet have no idea. Hint: It&#39;s Thomas Paine&#39;s main argument in <em>The Rights of Man</em>.</p>

<p>Any kind of tribalism is close-minded, but yours is pretty far up there :s</p>

<p>What I am trying to get through to you (dosent seem to be working so well though, does it?) is that people &quot;having to get tribal to protect their country&quot; is equally idiotic, due to your country being made up by invisible borders on a map, drawn by someone a long time ago... All this to compartmentalize and exploit idiots like you, by dividing them and having them squabble amongst each other while they make all the money...</p>

<p>Then again, I would hardly expect you to ever understand... with luck, perhaps your children or grandchildren will, when they remember you and how you used to swear about how all the fax machines are gone now, but they were everywhere when you were a youngster...</p>

<p>I bet they wont though, since you are probably raising them not to question anything, and keep their heads firmly in the sand.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t believe in anything supernatural or literal about the bible. Bible stories are simply examples of how to act. When everyone in a society acts like Jesus, that society will thrive. When everyone acts like Muhammed, everyone must submit to Sharia. Simple as that. </p>

<p>Check out the concept of Group Selection Theory. There is a very clear evolutionary purpose for religion. It sets a common set of goals for a group and the people identify not individually but with the &quot;higher principle&quot; of the group. This is why religious groups persist and atheist groups don&#39;t. And then &quot;New Atheists&quot; discover these old ideas and believe they&#39;ve come up with something original.</p>

<p>Of course, if you had a massive immigration of people that respected you and your culture, that learned the language, and wanted to become Swedish, then everything would be fine. If it was a bunch of Hindu Indians flooding into Sweden there would be no concern and I wouldn&#39;t care. But you are allowing a special kind of mental cancer into your country. The cancer of Islam.</p>

<p>You are mocking me for believing in Jesus (in an allegorical sense, I don&#39;t believe he actually performed miracles or rose from the dead). Yet, at the same time, you are allowing EVEN NUTTIER religious zealots in en masse. If there&#39;s something so deranged about me for believing in Christianity, how can possibly support FUCKING MUSLIMS pouring in? Only an Atheist can be so retarded.</p>

<p>The Battaclan theater massacre was done by second generation Muslims that were born in France. </p>

<p>The world is getting less and less religious each passing year, </p>

<p>The West is. The middle East is just as Muslim as it&#39;s ever been. And we now have ISIS and mass immigration as well. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>It is okay to be a muslim here... And also okay to be a christian, or an atheist.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why are Muslims being held to a different legal standard than Swedish men? Why isn&#39;t there an open discussion about it without being called racist? Why does the Swedish government lie and cover up Islamic attacks.</p>

<p>Basically, what you are doing is the same as me saying we have to stand up and fight vs the christians, using only westbro baptist church as an example of how crazy they are!</p>

<p>The westboro baptist church has yet to drive a semi through a shopping market. Let alone in three different countries within in months of each other.</p>

<p>How about female genital mutilation? How about child marriage? Or honor killings? Do you believe that there is anything a Muslim can do that you would say is evil? </p>

<p>See what happens to atheists. They lose their moral compass and lose themselves in moral relativism. &quot;Nah man, it&#39;s just their culture! It&#39;s not evil! He didn&#39;t mean to rape her. He didn&#39;t know&quot; You reach out your hand to help, and they know they are going to cut it off.

<p>I am gonna guess you are gonna have an aneurism soon, since you obviously have the weight of the world on your shoulders. Of course there are many things withing islam that I disagree with, and also the same is true for swedish society in general. Morals are transient and change over time. Just look at the victorian era, if you want.</p>

<p>You strike me as someone who needs to get out more, and meet more people... (not other people from the /r/whackychristianblusterers subreddit, since they will just reinforce your delusion</p>

<p>Oh my god you relativist fucking asshole. Swedish culture does not permit cutting female clits off and killing daughters that don&#39;t cover themselves. Are you fucking psychotic? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok. Good luck &quot;cooperating&quot; with the Muslims dude. I actually do hope it works out better than I am making it out to be. But if Swedish women start wearing hijabs to be safe, that would be bad right? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s actually very strong proof. Why would someone chronicling the supposed meetings blatantly steal from an earlier book if it wasn&#39;t fabricated? There&#39;s lots of inconsistencies that came along with this, like how the protocols call upon jews to remember the french revolution as an example of how great they were at manipulating the entire thing, while jews at that time had little to no part in the revolution. The old testament is quoted in latin, not Yiddish or Hebrew. The list goes on. </p>
