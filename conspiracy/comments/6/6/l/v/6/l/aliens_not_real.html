    <div class="md"><p>You must have had a boring childhood. I have fond memories of looking at the planets <em>and</em> galaxies with my telescope with my dad and uncle on summer vacations every year. Andromeda, m80, m42... I knew all the constellations, I knew where to spot the planets... All of it&#39;s mostly forgotten now. </p>

<p>Anyway, you people never answer questions, you just give bullshit responses and talk in riddles and think you&#39;re so fucking clever. It&#39;s really comical, but also sad. It&#39;s a sign of the times how desperate people are for purpose and validity that they believe absurdity like this. It is a sign of a civilization in collapse is what it is. And it&#39;s really no surprise. All of this has happened before and it will happen again. </p>

<p>Well, yes. Using blatant out of focus stars/planets will generally give you nothing similar to that. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dICIKYn5w4w">Learn how to focus a camera.</a></p>

<p>Why would God create &quot;the Heavens and the Earth&quot; and only create the Earth... on a flat plane... with nothing around it?

    <div class="md"><p>That has absolutely nothing to do with the question I am asking. You&#39;re not answering it because to do so would be to admit you&#39;re putting God in an incredibly stupid box. When you actually stop and think about it, a globe is the only thing that makes sense. We know the Earth is not infinite. We&#39;ve mapped the continents and coast lines. It&#39;s not procedural generated. If the plane the Earth exists on isn&#39;t infinite, then what does it exist inside of? It has to exist inside of something, right? So it is laying flat <em>on</em> something. What? Is it floating in infinity? If it is, can we find the edge? Because you are essentially arguing that God and the Devil are playing a giant, life sized DnD game. The Earth is on a giant table in God&#39;s basement with God hovering over it and Satan underneath it and we&#39;re the players in their game. In other words, the model of the universe you are suggesting, even within the logic of the idea that God created the universe, makes absolutely no sense. </p>

<p>But I think you are missing the point I was trying to make. Think of how vastly huge the universe is, think of all the beautiful images you see of the cosmos. Think of the complexity of gravity, of space-time, of even evolution, and consider that God put all of that into motion.</p>

<p>Or he created a flat, sterile world where everything just is... boring. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The idea is interesting but the conclusion is wrong. Gates has noted that the supersymmetric equations of string theory contain binary codes built in. These are the same as codes sometimes used in computing for error correcting (self dual 8-bit Hamming code). He uses this to hype it as a claim that we live in a Matrix-like simulation.</p>

<p>However, he fails to mention that this codes are not that uncommon in other areas of mathematics (sphere packings, reflection groups, lattices). It&#39;s actually nothing special and it coming up in string theory is not something unique. Other theorist describe those structures totally different, with less hype and speculation (if you want to read more search for Mike Duff and his colleagues!). It is always possible that these codes could play some kind of error correcting role in string theory preventing uncontolled decoherence of spacetime, but this is pure speculation and it is not clear if such a mechanism is even needed. These structures are natural and it would be wrong to see them as an indicator that the laws of physics have been programmed. </p>

<p>Don&#39;t get me wrong, the idea is neat and it is an exciting thought to think about how the universe could run as a program, but the conclusion that we live in a simulation is unjustified. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are two problems with alien life and the universe: location and space. Even if there is an alien civilisation it might be so far away that it is practically non-existent to us. The time problem however is way bigger than the location one: there could have been thousands of civilisations before us but they all ended before we reached the technology so we could communicate with them and there will be thousand more new species when we are gone. </p>

<p>The idea that science can&#39;t explain why we aren&#39;t picking up any radio waves is extremely easy when we&#39;re analysing our one planet and technology. We shifted from using radio waves as a mean of communication to using digital means. There is no need to use a radio transmitter when I can send you everything you need over an internet cable. It would be foolish to think that a much more advanced civilisation would use those rather primitive radio waves as a mean of communication. </p>

Look up the Fermi Paradox. It gives a good explanation of the scope of the universe, the math involved with life on other planets, and a few reasons as to why we don&#39;t have known contact with them.
Sagan said that it could be anything from sheer distance to us not being able to comprehend life that isn&#39;t three-dimensional and carbon based, to a species that takes 20,000 earth years to say hello.

    <div class="md"><p>That has absolutely nothing to do with the question I am asking. You&#39;re not answering it because to do so would be to admit you&#39;re putting God in an incredibly stupid box. When you actually stop and think about it, a globe is the only thing that makes sense. We know the Earth is not infinite. We&#39;ve mapped the continents and coast lines. It&#39;s not procedural generated. If the plane the Earth exists on isn&#39;t infinite, then what does it exist inside of? It has to exist inside of something, right? So it is laying flat <em>on</em> something. What? Is it floating in infinity? If it is, can we find the edge? Because you are essentially arguing that God and the Devil are playing a giant, life sized DnD game. The Earth is on a giant table in God&#39;s basement with God hovering over it and Satan underneath it and we&#39;re the players in their game. In other words, the model of the universe you are suggesting, even within the logic of the idea that God created the universe, makes absolutely no sense. </p>

<p>But I think you are missing the point I was trying to make. Think of how vastly huge the universe is, think of all the beautiful images you see of the cosmos. Think of the complexity of gravity, of space-time, of even evolution, and consider that God put all of that into motion.</p>
