        You can observe galaxies from Earth with your own telescope.

        I never said "advanced alien life." I said alien life. But given the size of the universe, I'm sure some civilizations would be advanced.
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       Are you saying the universe

        isn't
       </em>
       big?

      <p>
       Are you saying that the Earth is sitting inside of a snow globe, with a canopy of stars above it to make us think we're looking at other galaxies?
      </p>
      <p>
       Or are you suggesting that the Earth exists on an ocean surrounded by an infinite ice wall surrounding it?

       You must have had a boring childhood. I have fond memories of looking at the planets
       <em>
        and
       </em>
       galaxies with my telescope with my dad and uncle on summer vacations every year. Andromeda, m80, m42... I knew all the constellations, I knew where to spot the planets... All of it's mostly forgotten now.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, you people never answer questions, you just give bullshit responses and talk in riddles and think you're so fucking clever. It's really comical, but also sad. It's a sign of the times how desperate people are for purpose and validity that they believe absurdity like this. It is a sign of a civilization in collapse is what it is. And it's really no surprise. All of this has happened before and it will happen again.

       You know I'm right. That's why you keep responding. You're reducing dissonance because
       <em>
        you know
       </em>
       you are wrong and the discomfort the truth is giving you is forcing you to over compensate. If you were secure with your beliefs, you'd say nothing else. The fact is you've been caught. The jig is up. This conspiracy theory gives you purpose. It makes
       <em>
        your
       </em>
       world make sense. It is a delusion reinforced through Groupthink and selection bias and you
       <em>

       it is.

       Well, yes. Using blatant out of focus stars/planets will generally give you nothing similar to that.

       There's 0 chance that aliens don't exist. They're out there. They can't not be. But there is also a very close to zero chance they've been to Earth.  Not a zero chance, but close to it.

       The Universe is really, really, really big.  It is not possible to travel faster than light through spacetime and no technology can ever change that. Workarounds like wormholes &amp; and folding space are  theories, not fact. Not fact yet anyway. Time dilation ain't enough to solve the distance problem.

       Yeah, they're out there. But they're not here.

       Answer my question.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why would God create "the Heavens and the Earth" and only create the Earth... on a flat plane... with nothing around it? Why would God, whose wisdom and power is inconceivable to us, create something so fucking stupid as what is the equivalent of a model town? Your vision of God is of a guy who built a model train village and created some life to give it character. How insulting.

       That has absolutely nothing to do with the question I am asking. You're not answering it because to do so would be to admit you're putting God in an incredibly stupid box. When you actually stop and think about it, a globe is the only thing that makes sense. We know the Earth is not infinite. We've mapped the continents and coast lines. It's not procedural generated. If the plane the Earth exists on isn't infinite, then what does it exist inside of? It has to exist inside of something, right? So it is laying flat
       <em>
        on
       </em>
       something. What? Is it floating in infinity? If it is, can we find the edge? Because you are essentially arguing that God and the Devil are playing a giant, life sized DnD game. The Earth is on a giant table in God's basement with God hovering over it and Satan underneath it and we're the players in their game. In other words, the model of the universe you are suggesting, even within the logic of the idea that God created the universe, makes absolutely no sense.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I think you are missing the point I was trying to make. Think of how vastly huge the universe is, think of all the beautiful images you see of the cosmos. Think of the complexity of gravity, of space-time, of even evolution, and consider that God put all of that into motion.

       Or he created a flat, sterile world where everything just is... boring.

       If God is supposed to be an infinite being why would he put us in a finite terrarium? The best he can do is is simulate an infinite universe?

       We live in a simulation. UFOs are just people from outside the simulation coming in. IE: humans from the future. When you die you wake up and are told it was a simulation. You can either go back in and live another life or live the rest of your life in the real world.
      </p>
      <p>
       The reason we are put in a simulation is because the reality we come from, the planet is near destroyed. You can not go outside because of natural disasters constantly occurring among other disasters.

       The idea is interesting but the conclusion is wrong. Gates has noted that the supersymmetric equations of string theory contain binary codes built in. These are the same as codes sometimes used in computing for error correcting (self dual 8-bit Hamming code). He uses this to hype it as a claim that we live in a Matrix-like simulation.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, he fails to mention that this codes are not that uncommon in other areas of mathematics (sphere packings, reflection groups, lattices). It's actually nothing special and it coming up in string theory is not something unique. Other theorist describe those structures totally different, with less hype and speculation (if you want to read more search for Mike Duff and his colleagues!). It is always possible that these codes could play some kind of error correcting role in string theory preventing uncontolled decoherence of spacetime, but this is pure speculation and it is not clear if such a mechanism is even needed. These structures are natural and it would be wrong to see them as an indicator that the laws of physics have been programmed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't get me wrong, the idea is neat and it is an exciting thought to think about how the universe could run as a program, but the conclusion that we live in a simulation is unjustified.

       Lol no. The simulation is ran by a quantum computer of the future. He's saying if there's code that was invented by a guy in the 1940s within the fabric of our universe then it is likely we are living in a simulation. One of many I should add.

       Not in the future. If the theory is correct  quantum computer of the future is running our simulated universe. So you're not correct. In the future they could very well be real. And aliens might or might not exist, we don't know yet. If we live In a simulation, they do not exist.

       I read somewhere that because space is so vast if there is much life at all out there we should be picking up all kinds of radio waves that alien civilizations have generated over millions of years but we aren't and science can't explain. Except possibly there are few if any alien civilizations there.

       There are two problems with alien life and the universe: location and space. Even if there is an alien civilisation it might be so far away that it is practically non-existent to us. The time problem however is way bigger than the location one: there could have been thousands of civilisations before us but they all ended before we reached the technology so we could communicate with them and there will be thousand more new species when we are gone.
      </p>
      <p>
       The idea that science can't explain why we aren't picking up any radio waves is extremely easy when we're analysing our one planet and technology. We shifted from using radio waves as a mean of communication to using digital means. There is no need to use a radio transmitter when I can send you everything you need over an internet cable. It would be foolish to think that a much more advanced civilisation would use those rather primitive radio waves as a mean of communication.

       Not really. We get radio waves that are anywhere from a few years old to millions of years old because of the time it takes to travel through space. If a Civilization existed a million years ago and their radio waves take millions of years to reach Earth because they are so far away we wouldn't be able to listen to them until now. Until the waves could reach Earth

       Well, yes and no.  We (and they) will still use radio waves.  But they will be incomprehensible.  They already are getting close.  With beam steering, crazy-complex compression, polarization- and frequency-hopping schemes, it's theoretically possible to transmit unlimited amounts of information over limited bandwidth.  And no one would even be able to detect it -- it just looks like random noise.  So that's probably the answer to this paradox.

       Trying to avoid the personal attacking and instead offer the view of it.
Look up the Fermi Paradox. It gives a good explanation of the scope of the universe, the math involved with life on other planets, and a few reasons as to why we don't have known contact with them.
Sagan said that it could be anything from sheer distance to us not being able to comprehend life that isn't three-dimensional and carbon based, to a species that takes 20,000 earth years to say hello.
The universe is just too big for us to be alone.

       Why would God create "the Heavens and the Earth" and only create the Earth... on a flat plane... with nothing around it? Why would God, whose wisdom and power is inconceivable to us, create something so fucking stupid as what is the equivalent of a model town? Your vision of God is of a guy who built a model train village and created some life to give it character. How insulting.

       That has absolutely nothing to do with the question I am asking. You're not answering it because to do so would be to admit you're putting God in an incredibly stupid box. When you actually stop and think about it, a globe is the only thing that makes sense. We know the Earth is not infinite. We've mapped the continents and coast lines. It's not procedural generated. If the plane the Earth exists on isn't infinite, then what does it exist inside of? It has to exist inside of something, right? So it is laying flat
       <em>
        on
       </em>
       something. What? Is it floating in infinity? If it is, can we find the edge? Because you are essentially arguing that God and the Devil are playing a giant, life sized DnD game. The Earth is on a giant table in God's basement with God hovering over it and Satan underneath it and we're the players in their game. In other words, the model of the universe you are suggesting, even within the logic of the idea that God created the universe, makes absolutely no sense.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I think you are missing the point I was trying to make. Think of how vastly huge the universe is, think of all the beautiful images you see of the cosmos. Think of the complexity of gravity, of space-time, of even evolution, and consider that God put all of that into motion.

It's a sign of the times how desperate people are for purpose and validity that they believe absurdity like this. It is a sign of a civilization in collapse is what it is. And it's really no surprise. All of this has happened before and it will happen again.
