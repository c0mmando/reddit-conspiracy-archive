        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>There are nail scratches on the concrete walls of the supposed gas chamber at Auschwitz.</p>

<p>Were these scratched out with metal tools as part of a psyop?</p>

<p>Many people use these scratches as proof of the Holocaust. But are they physically possible?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In 1822 the German mineralogist Fredriech Mohs developed a “scratch test” used to determine mineral hardness. He developed a hardness scale that helps to identify mineral properties. The scale measures hardness on a scale of 1-10. One being the softest mineral (talc) and 10 being the hardest mineral (diamond). Common objects of known hardness can be used to determine mineral hardness. These common objects are: your fingernail (2.5), a penny (3), a piece of glass (6) and a knife blade or nail. For example, if your fingernail can scratch the mineral, it has a hardness of less than 2.5, which is quite soft. If the mineral can scratch glass it has a hardness of greater than 6, which is very hard.</p>

<p>Fingernail’s Mohs hardness = 2.5 (some sources say 2.2)
Concrete’s Mohs hardness = 5 to 9 (depend on the type of concrete)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Also,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;ve seen a fil made by a young Jew wherein he interviews the curator of the Auschwitz museum (this was in 1994) and the curator actualy says that the &quot;gas chamber&quot; shown to tourists was actually constructed by the Soviets out of a bomb shelter after the war because &quot;the Nazis destroyed the original one.&quot; The curator says that the building was originally built as a gas chamber but then the Nazis converted it into a bomb shelted during 1943 or 44 and then the Soviets converted it back.</p>

<p>You trying to imply Stalin had nothing to do with Socialism? Give me a break.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Socialism in One Country (Russian: Социализм в одной стране Sotsializm v odnoi strane) was a theory put forth by Joseph Stalin in 1924</strong>, elaborated by Nikolai Bukharin in 1925 and finally adopted by the Soviet Union as state policy.[1] The theory held that given the defeat of all the communist revolutions in Europe in 1917–1921 except Russia&#39;s, the Soviet Union should begin to strengthen itself internally. That turn toward national communism was a shift from the previously held Marxist position that socialism must be established globally (world communism), and it was in opposition to Leon Trotsky&#39;s theory of permanent revolution.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>yes, figures. figures made up by more people who where not there. even accounts of people who happened to have been there are bound to be inaccurate. like say I was a prisoner in a big camp with a lot of people being starved and tortured and killed all the time when did I have the time or mental capacity to take body counts and record the attendance of the camps? there are a lot of numbers out there in regards to the amount of people killed in the holocaust and the differ so dramatically that it should be investigated closer. no one is denying the fact that there was a holocaust or that there were prison camps or even that people were killed in mass numbers. there are just enough inconsistencies and known propaganda around that why wouldn&#39;t you be skeptical of the &quot;official narrative&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are some documentaries on Netflix about the concentration camps in Poland (Treblinka and Sobibor I think).  After watching the one on Treblinka that&#39;s when the doubts really solidified for me.  </p>

<p>For one thing the entire story of Treblinka came from survivors.  And how did they survive?  There was an uprising.  I found that to be a little astonishing.<br/>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treblinka_extermination_camp#Treblinka_prisoner_uprising">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treblinka_extermination_camp#Treblinka_prisoner_uprising</a>    </p>

<p>But, I was even more astonished when I found out that there was an uprising at Sobibor too.<br/>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sobib%C3%B3r_extermination_camp#The_uprising">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sobibór_extermination_camp#The_uprising</a>    </p>

<p>The entire existence of these places is based on the testimony of these prison uprisings.    </p>

<p>How many prison uprisings were there in WWII?    </p>

<p>I was even more astonished when I discovered that no one was ever allowed to actually study the physical evidence at Treblinka.<br/>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treblinka_extermination_camp#Archaeological_studies">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treblinka_extermination_camp#Archaeological_studies</a>    </p>

<p>They say the evidence for the death camps is overwhelming but they never even let people investigate the physical evidence at all?  </p>

<p>If that&#39;s not enough they did the same thing at Sobibor - the physical location was never investigated until 2014.<br/>
<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2014/09/19/archaeologists-unearth-hidden-death-chambers-used-to-kill-a-quarter-million-jews-at-notorious-camp/?utm_term=.90785574cb76">https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2014/09/19/archaeologists-unearth-hidden-death-chambers-used-to-kill-a-quarter-million-jews-at-notorious-camp/?utm_term=.90785574cb76</a>    </p>

<p>Scroll down and look at the evidence in that article.  Its a tiny little brick wall.  </p>

<p>I&#39;m sorry.  I truly wish I didn&#39;t believe this, but I find that evidence flimsy at best.  It&#39;s a stretch to call it evidence at all.    </p>

<p>What is truly astounding is that they actually block anyone investigating the sites.  Wouldn&#39;t they want to uncover all the evidence they could?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you make a post under the premise of entertaining the thought (because you yourself have no proof of whether or not the scratches are real or fake) you can&#39;t get pissy when people replying to you aren&#39;t providing proof either. Also you have a habit of calling people who disagree with you mentally ill. Why? Are you trying to insult? Discredit? Just be a dick? Regardless, you&#39;re showing ignorance. Mental illness is incredibly broad. Mild anxiety is mental illness for example. Now before you call me mentally ill, understand that I don&#39;t disagree with your main point - I believe the holocaust happened, but I don&#39;t believe it happened as they said it did. I don&#39;t believe as many people died as they claim they did. I don&#39;t believe there were gas chambers. I believe that a reasonably significant number of those who did die in concentration camps could have died due to supply lines being bombed and cut off by the allies, based on evidence brought up in a couple lectures I&#39;ve watched over the Internet. And yes what both you or I believe is at this point a believe, as neither of us were there at Auchwitz during the holocaust, so accept that people are going to be expressing their beliefs in this thread and if you can entertain their thoughts without needing to accept what they say as truth then we can have a more civilised conversation, which I&#39;d look forward to. But until you stop calling everyone who disagrees with you &quot;mentally ill&quot; we won&#39;t be able to have a proper discussion. </p>

<p>u/lawstuff11300 admitted he is mentally ill and a violent criminal. For example, he is threatening to kill people right now unless we stop discussing the holocaust and 911. He admitted he hit a Swedish person with a hammer. He says he enjoys hurting women and children. Do you want links to these posts? </p>

<p>Can you explain this in detail? I don&#39;t think it&#39;s clear what you mean, at least to me. How do you know &quot;the things they saw for real&quot; are not just lies?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because I&#39;m defining real to mean <em>real</em> in that sentence, not talking about what they <em>say</em> they saw.</p>

<p>The minimum standard for truth in any lie is that the liar believed that <em>somebody</em> would believe it.   </p>

<p>Whatever really happened, it resulted in people coming to the belief that those stories would be accepted by the public.</p>

<p>The simplest way for that to happen is if the stories are true.  Or if somebody believed they were true and relayed them from an authoritative stance.</p>

<p>You can create a lot of detail in a forty year game of telephone, so the credible reports come from the beginning.</p>

<p>After that, the ones that don&#39;t contradict the <em>likely</em> truth are more credible.</p>

<p>If I find a story that contradicts my understanding of human behavior or the more credible facts then I&#39;m skeptical.</p>

<p>Scratches in concrete?  I&#39;m a <em>little</em> skeptical, but looking at them, I think it&#39;s plausible that they were done by desperate hands.</p>

<p>Survived six executions?  I&#39;m more skeptical.   It&#39;s possible, so I won&#39;t disbelieve the story, but I&#39;m not likely to repeat it unless I get a second source indicating that people were routinely surviving executions.</p>

<p>Totally agree with this.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Agree with this.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>I think psychological manipulation tactics like &quot;invoke authority&quot; don&#39;t actually require the person to believe they are true. There are a lot more manipulation tactics, for example, making something horribly graphic like a shrunken head or scratches on the wall to make people think less logically and more emotionally.</p>

<p>Is there any part of the Holocaust that you disbelieve? I mean one claim was that they used nuclear bombs to vaporise 20,000 Jews. It&#39;s possible. Do you disbelieve that occurred? Are leprechauns possible? I mean, evolution shows a great variety in creatures. Is it not possible that very small humans existed?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is a different gas chamber anyway then what that witness is referring too. The gas chamber in the pictures was only used for less than a year in Auschwitz I. The much larger camp Auschwitz II was where most of the Jews were gassed and these were destroyed by the germans toward the end of the war. The gas chamber in the pictures was used mostly on Poles and dissidents that were kept in Auschwitz I. Probably less than 10,000 people were gassed in this chamber, and if i recall they rebuilt parts of this gas chamber after the war, so it is not 100% the way it was during 41-42.</p>

<p>To be able to just wash away the things you see as - well I am sure he is just a kid in America lol- you know that&#39;s not true, part of you knows it&#39;s not, this is my 4th main, my other 3 where banned from Reddit for posting photos and videos of my violence, people on the more extreme China reddits know me in real life, and this account will likely get suspended in a few days and I will just make a new one lol</p>

<p>I am not a kid, not even a troll, I am a bored rich crazy man in China who genuinely does not care about hurting other people </p>

<p>I have a backstory and blah blah blah but your not worth it</p>

<p>I also love arguing cause I am a lawyer so it&#39;s a hobby</p>

<p>See that&#39;s the fun for me, here is 6:30pm and I am just killing time at my overpaid job till I leave, that&#39;s all I do everyday, then I get high and pick fights at clubs and wrecks shit- rinse repeat</p>

<p>That&#39;s all I am going to keep doing, waste time on Reddit, fuck bitches, beat people, drugs, party, waste money on stupid shit, eventually die in a place fancier then you have ever been </p>

<p>Last month went to Macou, spent 20,000 usd on diner at Robacoun au Dome on me and my friends</p>

<p>Fuck it lol</p>

<p>See? You will live and die and never experience that, you are a walking abortion, I am superior to you- you are just a nothing on the internet desperate that the crazy man your talking to is a little boy</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Even if you&#39;re telling the truth, why would I or should I give a shit? You&#39;re automatically saying you&#39;re superior, done things I never have or will... </p>

<p>Friend, you&#39;re ignorant. You could be 50 years old, but you&#39;re still a child.  I couldn&#39;t care less about anything else you&#39;ve ever done, you could experience everything the world has to offer and still be ignorant. </p>

<p>Enjoy your 20k dinners, enjoy your violence, enjoy your lawyering.. do you. Even if true none of that changes the fact that right here, right now, you&#39;re doing the exact same thing I am: bitching at an idiot on the Internet. All of that life experience, how bad ass you are, etc washes out to nothing because (whether you want to believe it or not) you and I are the same.. Must be why you feel the need to &quot;share your experiences&quot;, so you have some shred of a whisper to hold on to so you still feel like you&#39;re superior in some way. I could share my experiences with you, but they don&#39;t matter either and I definitely don&#39;t feel the need. Why do you feel the need? No matter what you do or say, you&#39;ll never fill that hole inside of you.  </p>

<p>We&#39;re the same, and it probably makes you sick to think about and admit. </p>

<p>That&#39;s what scientists and Archaeologists do, measure things. Especially if they&#39;re going to try preserving something like painting it with some kind of laminar to protect it from being modified by tourists. You want to record the original details. They may have even done some kind of a 3d scan.</p>

<p>Depends on the MPA of the concrete, how recently it was poured etc. </p>

<p>If its a fairly sandy mix (like brick mortar), and it&#39;s &#39;green&#39;, it&#39;s possible. </p>

<p>It was wartime so it&#39;s possible they had a shortage of cement (saving it for bunker construction), so adding more sand would affect its structural integrity ie: make it softer, but not let fail structurally. </p>

<p>In a nuthsell, the word anti-Semitism has been weaponized. All you have to do now is call your opponent an anti-Semite. End of discussion. Lest any reader doubt the veracity of this statement, listen to Israeli politician Shulamit Aloni as she was responding to the question of why the Israelis kept using the anti-Semitic card whenever legitimate criticism is marshaled against Israel:</p>

<p>“Well, it’s a trick, we always use it. When from Europe somebody is criticizing Israel, then we bring up the Holocaust. When in this country people are criticizing Israel, then they are anti-Semitic. And the [Jewish] organization is strong, and has a lot of money, and the ties between Israel and the American Jewish establishment are very strong and they are strong in this country, as you know. And they have power, which is OK. They are talented people and they have power and money, and the media and other things, and their attitude is ‘Israel, my country right or wrong,’ identification. And they are not ready to hear criticism. And it’s very easy to blame people who criticize certain acts of the Israeli government as anti-Semitic, and to bring up the Holocaust, and the suffering of the Jewish people, and that is justify every- thing we do to the Palestinians.”</p>

<p>All of the gas chambers and crematoriums at auschwitz were destroyed between 1944 and early 1945.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In November 1944, with the Soviet Red Army approaching through Poland, Himmler ordered gassing operations to cease across the Reich. The crematorium IV building was dismantled,[70] and the Sonderkommando were ordered to begin removing evidence of the killings, including the mass graves.[71] The SS destroyed written records, and in the final week before the camp&#39;s liberation, burned or demolished many of its buildings.[72] The plundered goods from the &#39;Canada&#39; barracks at Birkenau together with building supplies were transported to the German interior.[70] On 20 January, the overflowing warehouses were set ablaze. On the same day, the gas chambers as well as crematoria II and III at Birkenau were blown up.[70] The raging fires lasted for several days. On 26 January 1945, the last crematorium V at Birkenau was demolished with explosives just one day ahead of the Soviet attack.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve never seen anyone base the conclusion that the holocaust was real on that particular factoid.  But i don&#39;t think the purpose of that memorial is to PROVE the holocaust happened, but to preserve the memory of a tragedy and to communicate an emotional impact associated with it.  If you want to call that a Psyop or propaganda- i think those terms are loaded but I wouldn&#39;t disagree.</p>

<p>Those scratches being authentic is not required to prove the holocaust happened.  But at the same time, I agree that them NOT being authentic- and certain people insisting that they ARE, DOES drive warranted skepticism of certain details of the holocaust narrative being portrayed as objective fact.  But be careful how far you take that skepticism.</p>

<p>The Nazis DID target ethnic groups and killed millions of people based on ethnicity.  A significant portion of those people killed based on a doctrine of &quot;ethnic cleansing&quot; were Jewish.  I don&#39;t think there is any possible way to argue that this isn&#39;t true, regardless of whether the number of jews killed at auschwitz fluctuates or a few people who claim to have been interned there are outed as frauds or whatever little details chip away specific holocaust stories.</p>

<p>But be careful how far you take that skepticism.</p>

<p>You mean because there are laws against it? Can you honestly say that it is normal for one historical event to have laws against questioning it?</p>

<p>Only lies need to be maintained by force ...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>whatever little details chip away specific holocaust stories.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And that&#39;s the interesting thing: the holocaust narrative is always changing. Even in this thread there was no single authoritative answer on the scratches: 1. u can scratch concrete with nails 2. u can but only when on point of death 3. u can&#39;t but if millions do it u can 3. u can but only if concrete is weak 4. u can&#39;t but they had metal pens 5. tourists did it 6. nazis did it for PSYOP 7. the scratches are only of a thin patina</p>

<p>They just generated all possible examples and let the narrative evolve into whatever is both most plausible and still maintains the emotional impact.For example tourists doing it kills the emotional impact so I doubt that will become official history. But the gas weakens concrete one will probably make it until some chemical engineer proves it is impossible in which case they&#39;ll just use a different one.</p>

<p>To me the important thing is not the props they put forward to PSYOP everyone but the evidence we should expect were the story real. For example, aerial photos of deforestation surrounding camps were millions were allegedly cremated.</p>
