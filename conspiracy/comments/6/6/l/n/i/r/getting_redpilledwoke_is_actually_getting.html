        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>No matter how it started out for you it most certainly started out as 1 item, 1 fact, 1 investigation that got you to reconsider everything and swallow your first redpill and start to become awakened.</p>

<p>But this isn&#39;t just 1 pill, its a course of pills, because after your first revelation, you start question the next thing and when you do the math/research, you find people also questioning that &#39;thing&#39; and thus you swallow the next redpill and go deeper down the rabbit hole.</p>

<p>Eventually you are looking for ever more and ever deeper conspiracies. 9/11, Aliens, Illuminati, God Vs. Satan, A.I. Skynet WW4, DNA Manipulation, Pedog8 doesn&#39;t cut it for you anymore, so you continue looking for or searching for the next pill to swallow.</p>

<p>Someone eventually mentions DMT, LSD, Shrooms, Ayahuasca so you go down that route and your brain blows open to reveal an infinite Universe with infinite dimensions and the there really is no you aside from the belief that you are. You come across extra-dimensional beings but the communication is too fast for you to grasp it, you travel through black holes and get disassembled and reassembled and when the trip ends, you are forever changed. But that&#39;s still not enough.</p>

<p>Next thing you know, you realize how wrapped up most people are in their own egos and care mostly only about themselves, that the system is rigged as a debt slave cog on the wheel zombie 9-5 machine, that most will think you are nuts if you try to share any of this but really it&#39;s them that&#39;s nuts for believing in the illusions, and next you know you have almost nothing in common with anyone anymore.</p>

<p>Get a dog and take it for walks......that&#39;s where the sanity is</p>

<p>Speaking of the &#39;aliens&#39;, I personally like to refer to them as the owners, or non-human managers of the human livestock.  </p>

<p>Whatever it is and whatever the fuck you want to call them, people, cultures, and religions have been talking about non-human entities mingling in human affairs all over the world since the time man learned (monkey see, monkey do) to write on cave walls.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would argue the evidence to the contrary about humanity&#39;s enslavement, but I care little to debate the finer points to someone already dedicated to the theory that it&#39;s a psyop.  Believe whatever you want, it bothers me none.</p>

<p>As far as &#39;concrete evidence&#39;, that depends much on what you decide is &#39;concrete&#39;.  I&#39;ve seen enough &#39;concrete evidence&#39; with my own two eyes to know we are not alone, and that if these beings wanted to be known there&#39;s nothing any world government could do to stop it.  The US government isn&#39;t just covering things up, they are doing what they are told.  So, who is really in charge here?</p>

<p>If there is an ant hill near my house, I just put down some sugar mixed with borax. The ants take the sugar back and it kills the colony.</p>

<p>We&#39;re the ants. All the aliens have to do if they want us gone is feed some Monsanto scientist some disinfo and he comes up with a great new pesticide. Maybe some of us catch on a little, and we think the pesticide is killing us, so we switch to organic foods but it&#39;s already in the water supply. Besides the entire point is to simply kill the bees anyway</p>

<p>Even if a few conspiracy theorists figure out what&#39;s going on it will be too late to do anything about it anyway. We have to bring the food to our colony, it&#39;s our nature.</p>

If an alien species has the technology and energy to make it to our planet, they have the intelligence to figure out our natural habits and use them against us. Free will only matters if you are aware you have a choice. Even though some are waking 99.9% of humants are not aware there are other choices.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The best research method for this topic is to get involved.  Read/Watch as much as you can from as many sources as you can.  Go to some MUFON meetings, or a conferences like the IUFOC.  Meet people and talk with them.  </p>

<p>It&#39;s also probably just a coincidence that <a href="http://www.express.co.uk/news/science/631341/New-shock-claim-JFK-was-murdered-by-CIA-days-after-demanding-UFO-files-and-NASA-visit">JFK was killed 10 days after writing memo demanding the CIA disclose information regarding UFOs and aliens</a> and requesting a visit to NASA to discuss the implications.</p>

I believe that there&#39;s folks out there conscripting everything they want you to believe. as much as this site maybe controlled by paid shills and people who speak up against it, they will never win in my years of seeking truth its never ever been as big as it is now. Forget the brigades that block this site they&#39;re not there when you sit with your friends are they. Fuck em.  Shill before you go my English and punctuation is fucking rubbish.

<p>I&#39;ll be damned but I&#39;ll keep digging. Really it comes down to people. We could end it tomorrow if we got it out far enough. But of course that&#39;s a pipe dream</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well I only follow NHL but most of those teams and the NHL comissioner  and NHLPA (players association) comissioner are all Jewish. Of course, this plays into the zion rabbit hole. I believe the NBA comish is also Jewish.  Anyway it&#39;s remarkable that it&#39;s close to all one religion owning multiple sports. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know about other sports but the reffing in the NHL is bush league and never consistent and comebacks happen all the time. Kinda like patriots and Barcelona earlier this year.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If there is money behind it, rigging is done. The only thing natural is your kids little league game but once they start showing promise thats when the scouts show up to see who is willing to play ball. Its more obvious in some ports then other, Tennis is the easiest red pill to go down.</p>

<p>All you really need to do is look at where the most money is being moved around and that is betting. Kind of why I&#39;m a fan of professional wrestling, at least its upfront about what it is. </p>

<p>Its really sucks though since sports are all some people have to keep them sane in this world and they get <em>angry</em> at the mere mention of rigging no matter how obvious. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Op wants to believe bullshit conspiracy theories (I believe 99% of all conspiracy theories are bullshit) because he finds it emotionally appealing to think he&#39;s found the secret truth to life. It&#39;s almost like a religion to him. All conspiracy theorist people have good intentions but they all spend too much time trying to cultivate an inner emotional &quot;high&quot; off of finding the &quot;truth&quot; rather than dealing with the ugly realities of life. </p>

<p>Reality: secret organizations are hard to hide forever, secrets inevitably get leaked, and there will always be people who are willing to cater to the conspiracy cultists for monetary profits. Reality is ugly, simple, and unsatisfying. </p>

<p>You dumb motherfuckers depress me. Believing in stupid theories because reality isn&#39;t exciting enough for you, Fuck this planet. Oh and go ahead and think I&#39;m like some paid government agent that meant to write this message to try to dissuade you from the &quot;truth&quot;. Honestly I&#39;d kind of take it as a compliment. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is the truth. It is largely a distraction from your own life. TPTB are obviously real. There are horrible people doing horrible things. That is evidenced in the constant wars, poverty despite trillions of dollars, what is represented in the media (ideals, values, opinions, even the people themselves), and there are people deliberately behind it.</p>

<p>But we have to realise we are being distracted from our own lives. Our goal here is to love, create, have fun, experience, and enjoy. Sitting and reading on mindless theories can and often is an addiction--it is for me. It is a distraction. By engaging in my own real life I will find more fulfillment and TPTB will have less power over me as I am not a slave to the world around me but immersed in the joy of myself and my own existence. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Assange was taken or is in hiding since Oct 17. I think he was taken. The files on wikileaks.org were fucked with, all the dates changed to 1/1/1984, a bunch of shit. Between October and December, lots of crazy shit happened on the internet. The place this all was happening, endchan POLAK channel, was hacked and taken down, so there are only archives of the threads in the docs mega link in the first thread I gave you. Even mentioning the topic on 4chan would get the thread locked <em>instantly.</em> And if you kept trying, you&#39;d get a permanent ban.</p>

<p>Wikileaks backups are all in the blockchain. Encrypted and stored in transactions on an unalterable public ledger. People have been trying to hack it and decode it. People say they have, but it&#39;s impossible to share online. Lots of people went dark between oct and dec. Certainly, the most mysterious thing I&#39;ve ever looked into. I was watching shit get instantly taken down, shilled and forum slid to oblivion, all the while going on for several months. I think that this is truly the bottom of the larger rabbit hole. It&#39;s just that if you do end up being able to do it all and decrypt the files, you&#39;re essentially a dead man. That&#39;s what it seems to me. But being aware of this is all I can ask of anyone.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The real time updates in the case were really unsettling, and they made the whole thing a lot more plausible too. In addition to seeing Alefantis&#39; instagram before it went private I was also on reddit the day someone noticed that Besta Pizza changed their logo and removed the pedo symbol. I couldn&#39;t fucking believe it, It was so damn soon after pizzagate broke that no major news organization/youtube channel/anything was even covering it yet. Either the news spread to the accused by word of mouth exceedingly quickly or they&#39;ve had people watching the internet and seeing what evidence we have for a while now. It was surreal to see a such a genuinely concerning and incriminating piece of evidence reduced to some pixels on a conspiracy theorists infograph forever (or at least for now).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>All of that is very very true.</p>

<p>I actually first started out with x-files(My parents used to watch it all the time when I was a kid and it just became an amazing show for me) and when I get older I started to notice how some thing in the show no matter how crazy it was i could see some of it actually happening. Mainly the government cover ups, secret black ops projects and the like got me interested in all general conspiracies and I noticed that they all are in some way connected.</p>

<p>Going down the psychedelics path was amazing for me. It really did help me get a grasp of what is around you and does open your mind(at least for me it did). It was a great few years doing them because of the spiritual enlightenment.</p>

<p>This pretty much explains where I am at now. No one really wants to hear my babbling about what the government does because &quot;Its not true&quot; when it really is the truth and they are stuck in their illusion of what reality is. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Part of realizing things in the world aren&#39;t quite what they seem, that there are hidden agendas and lost secrets, etc., are seeing things from different perspectives. Most people are very set in dogmatic belief structures. What they believe is right and anything else is wrong. To them, things are simple, definable, understandable... Often thinking other people are stupid or wrong for not seeing things the same way.</p>

<p>That&#39;s not how the universe is, in reality things are vast (infinite even), multi-faceted, and constantly changing. Limiting yourself to any beliefs or dichotomies is just that, limiting. Limiting oneself that much is silly and makes you a slave (to yourself, to others, whatever).</p>

<p>There are many ways to get those other perspectives, travel the world and help people, study all the great thinkers throughout history, meditation, etc. LSD and other psychedelics are like an easy button or a magic pill though. They rip you out of your ego/body and force different perspectives on you. Perspectives that are not defined by the animalistic desires, specific genetics, or past-experiences your body has had.</p>

<p>Allen Watts once said that Psychedelics are a tool, and if you are going to use them, use them like a tool, with a specific intent. He also said of them, &quot;If you get the message, hang up the phone.&quot; Meaning that they are very useful for the type of inner-and-outer-awareness philosophy he teaches, but should not be abused.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The myth of being &quot;woke&quot;, here is a topic to ruffle feathers. When it becomes self-rewarding behavior to reject information because you consider it mainstream, then you&#39;re assuredly not &quot;woke&quot; - yet, many seem to espouse this as one of the primary attributes of a &quot;woke&quot; person. What it is, however, is a sign of someone engaging in self-rewarding behavior and labeling it enlightenment. Rejecting knowledge for the sake of rejection and calling it wisdom is foolish, whatever grandiose motives you (speaking editorially and of no one in particular) assign to yourself. So you begin to accumulate theories to replace what you have rejected and instead of calling them theories - because humans are not good at dwelling in the world of the theoretical - you boldly declare them facts and reward yourself for discovering these facts that the deluded masses have somehow overlooked further proving to yourself your &quot;woke&quot; status and reinforcing - in your mind - your own credentials. Justifying a further rejection of whatever information you choose, for whatever reason you choose, evidence to the contrary be damned. How could those mainstream fools prove you wrong, after all? They&#39;re not even woke. Hardly worth consideration at all.</p>

<p>No, instead we&#39;re all simply living and - at best - learning as we go. Those who cling to falsehood in the face of fact, though, are simply living. It isn&#39;t such a bad life, I suppose; living while others learn and expand the boundaries of human knowledge. Reaping the benefits with none of the suffering through the cognitive dissonance as comfortable illusions are shattered and carefully cultivated theories turn to dross. When you realize you were mistaken, or motivated by something less pure than you had hoped. When you realize you were no paragon.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not unlike dying and coming back from the dead. It&#39;s more than a bit scary and literally nothing anyone can tell you about it can prepare you for it. The only way to know is to experience it for yourself.  </p>

<p>I suggest doing a lot of reading on the subject. So you can further decide if that&#39;s really a rabbit hole you&#39;d like to jump into.  </p>

<p>I&#39;ve only done it once and I&#39;m honestly afraid to do it again. I mean, I want to do it again. But, I just don&#39;t know if I can put myself through that again. At least not any time soon, maybe I&#39;ll be willing to visit again in the foreseeable future.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>As someone who has taken both, I can tell you they are not. 
And in fact many official studies are now also admitting that they are not.  And since you probably only trust things that come from &quot; official&quot; sources heres one easy to find articles from<a href="https://www.google.com/amp/amp.timeinc.net/time/4586702/magic-mushrooms-psilocybin-depression/%3Fsource%3Ddam">the New york times</a> , and I&#39;m sure if you put in any effort you could find many more </p>

<p>&quot;However, in the early 1970s, psilocybin was classified as a schedule 1 drug, which means the government believes it has a high potential for abuse. &quot; 
Aka the government believes it Might make people reconsider devoting their lives to  being slaves in a Capitalist society, for little gain only to aquire material possessions with the false hope that after they have acquired enough stuff they will be happy and their life will have meant more than just being a corporate slave. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why would you think seeing that there are infinite dimensions is fucking up your brain? 
If a Rat is kept inside of a box with no windows and then one day someone cuts a hole in the box allowing the rat to see that the world he lives in is  bigger than the box is that rats brain fucked up? The world is more than just our physical reality, and even the most basic physics lesson will show you that. </p>

<p>You are conditioned to feel the way you feel, and until you experience a psychedelic you just wont really get it. 
And if you are holding on to your social conditioning like a security blanket and trusting that the box you live in cant possibly have anything outside of it, you probably wont try psychedelics soo , thats that I guess, good luck! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>for me it was reading Alan Watts 30 years ago. and in a way Chernobyl. 
i started reading Robert Anton Wilson, Illuminati Trilogy - and Cosmic Trigger. Timothy Leary - but it did not feel to me like going down a rabbit hole... i was going up. i quit my job,left my country hitch-hiked through europe and experienced amazing and horrible things. i met people that claimed to be enlightened and i met evil people. i eventually gave up on searching and just did my art and lived my life. it was like living in a fantastic dream. i settled down and eventually in 2011 i got bored again and discovered something on the internet that led me - down the mentioned rabbit hole. for me it was the Baltic Anomaly :D i was obsessed with that - and i got obsessed with a whole lot of other weird things- probably mostly because i had done my journey and was hungering for something else. now six years later of crawling through rabbit holes i´m back to Alan Watts and i feel fine about the world. it´s crazy beautiful.</p>

I&#39;ve branched out into other things of course but ever since I was able to read the transcripts from the frank church hearings in 75 I&#39;ve been hooked. The red pills and the rabbit hole are pretty damn depressing. Knowing just about everything has been a lie I don&#39;t and can&#39;t enjoy television or movies. Researching these topics for some time now. I&#39;ve reached only one conclusion, humanity is fucked until enough people get pissed off and do something about it. I wouldn&#39;t mind going back to being asleep. Ignorance is bliss but knowing the truth is much more rewarding.</p>

Some are open to feeling things are messed up and wading the waters into this spiderweb of corruption, occult ritual behaviors, cover-ups and all around &quot;questionable topics&quot;, but these kind of subjects need hours and hours of explanation, information, documents, reputable news stories, false news stories from the MSM to show the propaganda lies, etc etc etc....but, more often than not none of that is at your disposal when you need it most.  However, I Still love my family and my friends, but talks and chit chat don&#39;t seem very genuine unless it is just showing care and interest in the moment for the simpler things.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d Just like to point out that angels and demons fall into the same category of Extraterrestrial​s/aliens as they are not &#39;from&#39; here.  </p>

<p>Speaking of the &#39;aliens&#39;, I personally like to refer to them as the owners, or non-human managers of the human livestock.  </p>

<p>Whatever it is and whatever the fuck you want to call them, people, cultures, and religions have been talking about non-human entities mingling in human affairs all over the world since the time man learned (monkey see, monkey do) to write on cave walls.</p>

<p>So, psyop?  Probably not.</p>
