       Well politicians have associated with a lot of artists with controversialâ€‹ lyrics. If I remember correctly Obama was a big fan of eminem and Snoop dog and Jay Z. Doesn't mean that he was doing anything related to slim shady's antics.

       I don't know much about Ted, but to piggyback off your point, this could be a case of singing about things you don't believe in.
      </p>
      <p>
       In Eminems biography he talks about how he never really did drugs, besides weed, till after he dropped The Slim Shady LP. After that people started offering him drugs after his concerts, specifically shrooms because of
       <em>
        My Fault.
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        Jailbait
       </em>
       could also be a case of trying to draw attention to an issue by being a bad guy or talking about bad things, that the singer didn't actually do; see
       <em>
        Dance With The Devil
       </em>
       by Immortal Technique.
      </p>
      <p>
       " Cause I was there with Billy Jacobs, and I raped his mom too," says Technique, but he has gone on record plenty of times saying the story isn't true and is supposed to be a message to draw awareness to issues.

       But with Eminem he's always said Shady was a dark and evil character (in Criminal he even has that "people ask me if I do what I talk about on records" bit) and Immortal is a pretty conscious rapper and it fits in his persona to tell that story. Rappers in general tend to put on fronts and characters when they rap. I don't know too much about Nugent but is there any indication he's putting it on in the song or that he condones it?

       A lot of artists draw attention to issues in such a manner, besides rappers.
      </p>

       Also Em has said him and shady are the same; do you believe that too?

       I understand that other artists do it as well but the comments were about rappers so that's why I was directly talking about them. But more broadly I was trying to say context is important. With Shady you know he's talking shit. With Immortal you know he's telling a story.
      </p>
      <p>
       I looked up Ted Nugent and the guy is quoted saying "I was addicted to girls. It was hopeless. It was beautiful. I got the stamp of approval of their parents. I guess they figured better Ted Nugent than some drug-infested punk in high school" in '98. Jailbird was released in '81. Apparently the dude adopted a 17 year old so they could sleep together without her parents getting involved. Courtney Love claims Nugent made her give him oral when she was 12. It slowly becomes clear the context of the song probably isn't against being with underage girls.

       Nice research, can you give some sources? Like I said I didt know much about him.
      </p>
      <p>
       I will secure you are wrong about Immortal.  Why else would the second top comment in the recent thread about
       <em>
        Dance With the Devil
       </em>
       be about if it was true or not?  Someone even needs to explain to another that it is a metaphor, like I was saying.

       I feel like we're going in circles with Immortal and Shady but like i said it's all about context. I guess I should have clarified more but I meant when you know the artists you know what they're saying isn't real. People debate over whether Dance with the Devil is real or not but it became a really popular song and most of the people who heard it had no idea who Immortal was. They didn't have context. With Shady people listen to him and take what he says as literal but like you said with his biography when you have the context you know it's not. So people can argue over it but I'm saying that doesn't matter because when you have the context of the artist you know Immortal and Shady don't mean the shit they say, Nugent probably does.

       I've always thought Nugent was your edgy but harmless 2nd Amendment lovin' good old boy.  But those lyrics are even creepier than Neil Diamond's "You'll Be A Woman Soon."

       I think Neil's song is about Romeo and Juliet, two young adults. I hope. It's hard finding heroes these days.

       Everything is pizzagate!! Jesus, quit trying to tie everything into pizzagate ffs. Sometimes a song is just a song. Songwriters have been writing songs about teenage girls going all the way back to the 50's. This is just getting dumb.
