       Nope. Entertained it, moved on to other more fascinating models/theories. Still undecided. I do know that though, and I would not have learned it, hadn't I entertained the idea. So...

       and how do you explain the variety of phases of the Moon that can be seen in broad daylight when both the Sun and the Moon are up in the sky? Shouldn't it always be a full Moon in those instances? What accounts for those various other shadows on the Moon?

       Because there other ways to test things other than direct observation, which can be more misleading than it is enlightening? Conspiracy theories that question fundamental science are the absolute worst conspiracy theories, because they are just born of ignorance, not knowledge.

       Think about this: how do you know the ocean is made of water? I assert that it is actually half water and half something else, a liquid molecule that we haven't clearly defined. If it is water, why can't we drink it freely without getting sick? Can we? People who drink seawater begin to hallucinate, maybe that undefined liquid molecule is actually the remains of the primordial ooze out of which all life formed, essentially the stem cells of all life. We eat salty foods all the time and process it just fine. Go right now and eat a pinch of salt, you will be fine. How can we PROVE that its water, and not just a disinformation campaign to prevent us from drinking sea water?
      </p>
      <p>
       Good conspiracy theories accept that we understand portions of our natural world, but question that that is ALL there is, which is the meaning of super-natural.

       That's 100% what I think it is. It's no coincidence that when you search for videos and sites about criticism of NASA or ISS fakery, even with Apollo fakery to some extent, the most high-profile debunking videos that result often have Flat Earth in the name or title.

       It's a discredit-by-association op so NASA gets away scot-free as usual to continue scamming away.

       I don't have hard evidence odiously but I'm trying to come up for a reason why a group of usually intelligent bunch of people would keep pushing this moronic theory.

      <p>
       They only explanation I can come up with is that an outside force is pushing it.

       I called him a moron because he couldn't follow the conversation we were having. But something is odd about you making you making this post. I never see mods engaging in discussion yet you here you are getting "triggered" over my disagreement with this theory. Are you a believer as well

       As I said, if you don't like Flat Earth posts, just ignore them - that's what most of us do. But if you try to shame someone for espousing a conspiracy that you don't like, there's a good chance you will get banned.

       I'm not claiming flat earthers have anything figured out.
      </p>
      <p>
       My only point is that round earthers are just as stupid. In fact, I'll say they're even more stupid because at least flat earthers are just saying maybe that is possible. Whereas, round earthers KNOW, they fuckin' know man because of the evidence and the math. Despite the fact they've never done astrophysics work in their entire life.

       It's actually so easy that you can do it yourself in a variety of ways. For example, you can measure angle of two shadows in different cities on the summer solstice, the same way an Egyptian mathematician did so in 240 B.C.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        In 240 B.C., the Greek astronomer Eratosthenes made the first good measurement of the size of Earth. By noting the angles of shadows in two cities on the Summer Solstice, and by performing the right calculations using his knowledge of geometry and the distance between the cities, Eratosthenes was able to make a remarkably accurate calculation of the circumference of Earth. ~

       You could also look up a a celestial body using a telescope and note they are spheres. Why would every other celestial body be a sphere except for earth? The only way they would even appear to be round is if they are disks with a texture that always faces towards an individual, you know, the same way old games got out of using 3D textures on trees.

       You don't need astrophysics, though. You can use simple math and basic logic or even just observation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Watch a ship pass over the horizon. Right as it starts to 'sink' below the horizon, climb to the top of a tower or a lighthouse. The boat is visible again.
      </p>
      <p>
       Get a telescope and start really observing the night sky. Pay attention to the constellations you see. Then take a vacation to somewhere in the other hemisphere, and look up at the stars again: how is it that you see different ones?
      </p>
      <p>
       The one that seems most apparent to me is, why is gravity uniform over the entire map? The gravitational pull of a flat surface is not uniform across that objects surface.
      </p>
      <p>
       Personally, I am a scientist, and I study earth systems. There are a thousand very complicated ways to show that the earth is a sphere, through geophysics, vulcanism, and tectonics, but there are also many simple way to do so as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is a good policy to not assert that you KNOW something to be true without having some understanding of it yourself. I work in the epicenter of climate change research, and while I understand the systems involved extremely well, the overall 'climate model' is highly complicated, so I don't argue either way. With something like flat earth, though, you do not have to rely on 'faith' in other human scientists.

       It's called "poisoning the well", a known tactic for discrediting an idea. The military's cyber brigade will shoehorn this flat earth concept into every conspiracy forum so they can later have the media say "You really believe in government sponsored corruption? You must be one of those flat earth kooks".
      </p>
      <p>
       I've never seen the flat earth thing pushed so hard in my life as it's been in the past year, while it seems even my grandmother is waking up to all the crimes that are committed by the state. The criminals are getting more desperate as time goes on and they are literally trying every trick in the book to put people back to sleep.
