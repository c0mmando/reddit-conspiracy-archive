When the &quot;attack goons&quot; aren&#39;t effective in getting users to break rules, &#39;they&#39; ban you for made up reasons. </p>

<p>and for anyone wondering, this is how they will ban this post. they remove OP and then remove post because OP tells the community what happened. </p>

<p>&quot;Those who can make you believe absurdities can make you commit atrocities.&quot;</p>

<p>I believe we aren&#39;t allowed to have stickied discussions of the Flat Earth because the FE psyop is so flimsy that shining light on it would erase the very psyop that&#39;s being promoted. IMO I&#39;d say it&#39;s a strong conspiracy.</p>

<hr/>

<p>flat earth propagandists can&#39;t answer one simple question:</p>

<p>To debunk a globe model; they have yet to produce is a photo of edge of the flat earth. - See more at: <a href="https://www.henrymakow.com/2016/02/Flat-Earth-Psyop.html#sthash.hSBKysdN.dpuf">https://www.henrymakow.com/2016/02/Flat-Earth-Psyop.html#sthash.hSBKysdN.dpuf</a></p>

<p>go ahead, prove us all wrong. </p>

<p>FE is a CIA psyop</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ya everyone knows about the sun and the stick experiment. No one is dumb enough to not understand that. What you&#39;re missing is in the geocentric model, the sun is much closer and much smaller. </p>

<p>The ships sailing over the horizon isn&#39;t valid either. Let the ship sail out of view, than pull out a telescope and you can see the whole thing again. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying you have to believe FE, but you should really understand their model before bringing up points like this. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So then the obvious question is are there any experiments we can do to prove their model?  You can look up experiments to prove the world is round, but I haven&#39;t really seen any that try to prove it isn&#39;t.  Just a bunch of nonsense trying to make up stuff to disprove the experiments you can do to prove it is round.  Like saying NASA are liars, or that there is an ice wall that no one can go see because the governments of the world (in maybe the only time they work together) prevent you from doing so.  </p>

<p>Frankly FE seems to be a religious conspiracy.  It always seems like those who believe in it have some sort of religious twist to it when I have actually talked with them on an individual basis.  Usually a common trend seems to be that this somehow helps them believe that there is some god that they connect with.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well just like every other conspiracy, there&#39;s idiots who make all types of outrageous claims on either side. </p>

<p>Anyone to claim an ice wall without seeing it is full of shit. Same with the religious angle to it. No one saw God create a flat earth. Its all speculation. Same with the firmament. </p>

<p>People really need to stick to the arguments they can test and verify for themselves, otherwise they&#39;re muddying the waters. </p>

<p>The thing that is questionable to me, in regards to the heliocentric model, is how you can see many landmarks when they should be well below the curvature. Btw, the formula for the earth&#39;s curvature is 8 inches per mile, then you square the amount of miles. That&#39;s something you or I could test for ourselves. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve also seen videos of balloons going to 121,000 feet and show no curve, with the horizon rising with the camera. Again, that&#39;s something you or I could verify. It would cost probably $500 to do that experiment. </p>

<p>As for NASA, they&#39;ve lied in the past, therefore they lose all credibility with me. They have a motive to lie as well. It&#39;s propaganda, showing they&#39;re at the forefront of space exploration. Also so they can extract as many tax dollars as possible, to the tune of billions per year. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll check out your links when I get home, but yes, the very bottom of ships are not visible when they&#39;re far away, but it&#39;s not due to curvature. It&#39;s from atmospheric lensing and light refraction. There&#39;s alot of humidity in the air, especially over bodies of water. There&#39;s also a delta T from the water to the air above contributing to this as well. You ever look at freshly poured asphalt on a hot summer day? </p>

<p>Let me ask you though, do ships disappear passed the curvature of the earth? If so, how far away would a 50 foot ship have to travel away from us to be 100% over the horizon? </p>

<p>You&#39;re absolutely correct. But let me throw this anaolgy at you.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s say your mother has an instagram. Let&#39;s say you don&#39;t know about it. Let&#39;s say you find out about it. On this instagram are pictures of occult art shows you weren&#39;t aware of. Let&#39;s say there are pictures of children that she claims is family yet you never see the rest of said faimly (ie the &quot;goddaughter&#39;s parents)</p>

<p>Let&#39;s say she&#39;s been sending emails about food, completely out of context from the actual food, as in &quot;can I play dominoes on cheese?&quot; Let&#39;s say momma&#39;s got friends who all make the same jokes, take similar odd pictures of children (that are not criminal, mind you, just creepy), and all attend the same events that involve occult art and voodoo.</p>

<p>Now, would you say your mom is <em>definitely</em> fucking kids, or would you just say you want to <em>ask her some questions?</em></p>

<p>The latter, is all Pizzagaters want. I welcome a solid alibi, even if it&#39;s a fucking lie. Anything to explain what the fuck is going on.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First, if somebody close to me had a secret life, that&#39;s very different than if a stranger did things they didn&#39;t tell me.  You&#39;re asking me if I should be prying in to the life of a stranger based on these accusations.</p>

<p>Second,  aren&#39;t you misrepresenting the evidence?</p>

<p>You&#39;re talking about patterns, but one of the reasons I don&#39;t buy it is the lack of a pattern.</p>

<p>They&#39;re not making &quot;the same jokes&quot;, the jokes are completely different, and only made once or twice over the course of a social media account.</p>

<p>The only link to pedophilia is <em>assumed</em> in each case.</p>

<p>A woman is accused of pimping out her children because she sent an email where she mentions their ages and says &quot;you&#39;ll have entertainment&quot;.  But we never see that notation anywhere else, and she never sends any other emails that could be interpreted that way.  Apparently she got out of the child prostitution business entirely after the one email.</p>

<p>That&#39;s not the case for one or two of these things, that&#39;s the case for <em>every single example</em>.</p>

<p>We don&#39;t see the same jokes twice, the same slang twice, the same kids twice.  </p>

<p>When somebody&#39;s private correspondence is exposed and they&#39;re put under a microscope, you <em>see</em> patterns. </p>

<p>So no I don&#39;t think that&#39;s enough for an investigation, I think everything is pointing towards them being the victims and a public inquiry is just more humiliation.</p>

<p>First, if somebody close to me had a secret life, that&#39;s very different than if a stranger did things they didn&#39;t tell me. You&#39;re asking me if I should be prying in to the life of a stranger based on these accusations.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I would be a hypocrite if I said I didn&#39;t respect Mr. Alefantis&#39; privacy. However, everything gathered has come from his public posts on Instagram. That&#39;s not prying, that&#39;s visiting. </p>

<p>You did not answer my question. You danced around it. I said there was nothing criminal presented by these photographs, emails, even the Epstein flight logs.</p>

<p>What I asked was, if you found that your mother had a secret life involving occult art, spirit cooking, and strangely worded emails to her friends, would you shrug it off as completely ordinary or would you ask her about it?</p>

<p>That&#39;s exactly why people believe it&#39;s a psyop meant to divert people</p>

<p>There is significant evidence that supports round Earth that is completely ignored by Flat Earthers that you can verify yourself without needing to rely on &quot;fake NASA&quot; or &quot;fake math&quot; as they so like to put it</p>

<p>I assume you&#39;re in the northern hemisphere, why can&#39;t you see Sigma Octanis? If it&#39;s because of perspective, why do you see the same constellations that they see in Asia/Russia? Why do the stars appear to rotate counter clockwise around the northern celestial pole and clockwise around the southern? </p>

Newton, Copernicus, Einstein and Darwin were all freemasons using their theories to push the false globe model. NASA is a joke, using tethers, underwater tanks, green screens and parabolic flights to simulate weightlessness. We have been lied to...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The first globe model is far older than the 1400s (which would be 500 years before satellites not 4) Aristotle and many others had proofs for a round Earth. The Egyptians even portrayed knowledge of Sirius being a three star system, which was not known by modern science until the 1980s. The ptolemaic model of a flat Earth has not been accepted as a literal cosmological by the intellectual class of any society ever, including ptolemaic egypt.

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m schizo and I&#39;m not this dumb, why do you make sweeping generalizations?</p>

<p>The study of mental illnesses is flawed because we never research how to live happy and enlightened but instead test different methods of treating &quot;problems&quot;. This may also provide incentives to promoting labels of mental illness because it means money. </p>

<p>Everything in psychology seems to be studied at the angle of &quot;this is a problem we need to fund research into and fix, we can&#39;t afford studying fascinating things&quot;. So this incentivizes scientists who are fascinated by something to frame it as a problem that needs a solution. </p>

<p>This can mean that symptoms of having something like schizophrenia will be diagnosed even if their life is going somewhat well. The person is conditioned to fear these symptoms for their own &quot;sanity&quot;. Social factors lead to stigma and loads of other issues like mass hysteria (witch hunt mentality). </p>

<p>Nothing is a mental illness. I&#39;m depressed daily on a chemical and external level. I actually associate my depression with society. That life is too empty, boring, meaningless, unstimulating. Like I&#39;m forced to work such a terrible job just because society can&#39;t reach utopia already. </p>

<p>I think depression regardless of chemical causes, always has a realistic basis. The chemicals just make it harder for you to find a happiness bias. Honestly it doesn&#39;t make any sense how someone could be happy in this world unless they have adapted to the corruption or learned to ignore all of the very real problems with humanity and life. </p>

<p>Psychiatry is broken because capitalism doesn&#39;t work. It&#39;s fake. Competition is a joke. </p>

<p>Are you working at a desk job and browsing Reddit all day? Is it because you enjoy this aspect of capitalism? Your a slave and it&#39;s not different than communism. The same corrupt people take power and find ways to keep the working class in agreement with their plans. </p>

<p>Your not competing. No one likes capitalism except the really high up people. Your all in denial and your just supporting these high up people because they tricked you into being delusional that you have some shot at getting rich and famous. This is the same mentality as compulsive gambling. It also relates to religious mentality. Both of these associate with novelty and the D2 dopamine receptor. This receptor is implicated in schizophrenic symptoms, addiction, religious mentality, risk taking, novelty seeking. Not all of these are in the same direction, some having negative correlation. </p>

<p>People need to stop judging mental illness. The fear and propaganda of having something like schizo pretty much worsens the condition. I&#39;m pretty sure language can be used to help most people out of their issues but we need to stop victimizing these people. </p>

<p>Schizo traits have tons of benefits. This comment shows my level of thinking for example. It&#39;s highly associative and perceptive in my opinion compared to what most others are like. Maybe it&#39;s arrogant to say that. But I also can&#39;t function with most of normal society things. But I&#39;ve learned to take my gifts and push them to their limits. </p>

<p>I&#39;m more Schizotypal so it isn&#39;t as bad. But I&#39;ve had psychosis plenty times. I know when I&#39;m in it too. I just start reducing myself. Preventing myself from concluding too many assumptions. I still feel my conclusions unfortunately. Usually paranoid. </p>

<p>After thinking so deeply constantly, I&#39;ve actually forgotten what it&#39;s like to be &quot;normal&quot;. I find it really hard to empathize now sometimes. I feel caring, but usually people&#39;s behavior does not make sense. Too much ego for example. Letting go of ego lets you come closer to an objective perspective. </p>

<p>To realize ones own potential means to stop constantly assuming a humble position for example. How come this isn&#39;t taught in therapy? Therapy just belittles people and helps them become &quot;normal&quot; and reject their gifts usually. </p>

<p>Acting humble is a barrier to true rationality. Stop caring who&#39;s better or worse and just think about how things are. Take intellectual risks. Allow yourself to look stupid or be wrong. It doesn&#39;t matter unless you harm someone. </p>

<p>Ok I&#39;m done now wow. Too much. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just wish people on Reddit would actually try discussing things that cause personal growth or are interesting. Too bad it&#39;s infested with shitty karma porn that is too easy and time wasting. Just simple addicts. </p>

<p>And then people always have to react to my deeper posts instead of engaging. I&#39;m manic because you can&#39;t keep up right? Or because you care about irrelevancies because your a Nazi. Then your ego comes out and you just say &quot;yes I&#39;m smart I already know about everything you said&quot; then how about you expand on it instead ? I&#39;m sure you maybe thought a little more about it. If you want to compare penis sizes we can. But who cares about penises? It&#39;s wasting time. </p>

<p>Now I&#39;m sorry if this hurts. But I&#39;m tired of Reddit now. I just want to discuss and spread ideas. I clearly picked the wrong person. Because you need my comment to be perfectly relevant. </p>

<p>And now my ego is offended at your mania comment I guess. And I&#39;m just wondering why ego had to get involved. </p>

<p>Fuck me for wanting to talk about the actual topic of the thread right? And no it doesn&#39;t hurt, I&#39;m just sitting here confused as fuck on where your anger and indignation came from.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why do you even assume I&#39;m angry? Now i am because I have to censor myself and it&#39;s so hard. </p>

<p>Why should we stay on topic? A thread should just generate ideas that are useful to readers. They can read tons of other &#39;relevant&#39; comments and skip mine if they wish. Sometimes I write comments as if they are blog posts. Not really, they are much simpler than that even. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not even mad tho. Maybe I am looking for ways to interject ideas I&#39;ve had lately and I felt your mental illness comment somehow justified it. </p>

<p>And I was joking about the r/iamverysmart. I think that subreddit is ridiculous and a detriment to people. It is like slut shaming or whatever shaming. And really they are probably posting people in mania consistently and NOT &quot;wanna be smart people&quot;. </p>

<p>Your joke was shaming people&#39;s ideologies by associating them to another shameful group. Sure it&#39;s a joke yeah but why even? I don&#39;t give a fuck how common the joke is. I&#39;m also vegan and meat eaters are common. This means nothing. </p>

<p>Idk I&#39;m just bored man. Ignore this and move on. I&#39;m clearly instigating impulsively because I crave stimulation. I&#39;m bored not angry. I&#39;m even being hypocritical. So just move on. And stop talking shit. It gives me reason to attack you back. Perhaps it&#39;s what I&#39;m aiming for. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mean I&#39;m really not trying to attack you, my original post wasn&#39;t attacking you. You wrote a giant blog post which had almost nothing to do with what I said, and I (justifiably, since you responded to my comment).</p>

<p>And I <em>honestly</em> think that post reeks of mania. That wasn&#39;t said in a &quot;hah you&#39;re a retard!&quot; way, it was said in the &quot;dude, you alright?&quot; way. I have minor episodes of mania myself from having had depression/anxiety for so long (tends to rewire your mind for the worse, so you have to use mindfulness to teach your mind to snap out of common loops), so I know what it looks like. </p>

<p>Anyway, sorry if I offended, just wanted to clear that up. I&#39;ll leave you alone now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I already am used to being manic. I&#39;m manic all the time. I&#39;m a psychonaut and I chase manic and psychotic states and then write loads of journals about the pharmacology and many relevant ideas. To me everything can seem relevant.

<p>I&#39;ll probably take some OTC lithium soon though. I&#39;ve been putting it off cuz I&#39;m hooked on tianeptine pretty bad and I&#39;m having finals and I&#39;m way behind. I&#39;m scared I&#39;ll get even more sleepy and lazy and apathetic. I reached a state of dysphoric anhedonia. </p>

<p>I&#39;m already cut down to 20mg 2x per day now of tianeptine. This stuff barely even works right now but it&#39;s hard to function if I&#39;m not taking it. </p>

<p>I think it might also relate to me using salvia in hopes it would cut down my tolerance because of its kappa agonism. </p>

<p>Sorry this is my last lengthy reply lol. </p>

<p>Yeah I&#39;ll try to stop being manic. I like posting manic sometimes tho. </p>

<p>I&#39;m into nootropics also, and actually that&#39;s where I got somewhat popular as a psychonaut. It&#39;s why I have my karma level I have tho. </p>

Sounds like your experiences have helped you in finding the awareness to live your life and make decisions according to your own free will, without concern about judgement from others which is admirable. I personally don&#39;t think it&#39;s anyone else&#39;s responsibility to diagnose mania or illness in another person, especially because words can hardly justify the truth of actual experience. Furthermore, would anyone have come to the conclusion that you might be manic had you not mentioned personally having a mental illness? My guess would be no. You don&#39;t have to accept what others say is your truth, especially strangers online. I appreciated reading what you said and connect a lot with it myself. Be well friend :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you :) yes. Government but also I think the common ego is part of it. It&#39;s like everyone is perpetually stuck in self-conscious high-school mentality and their biggest concern is to not look dumb or suck. Competition of who sucks worse arises. Lol. </p>

<p>But yeah the gov seems to promote this mysteriousness about things like schizo and drugs. When it&#39;s a lot more down to earth in my opinion. Schizo only seems to make someone break from typical assumptions. Like religion isn&#39;t schizo because it&#39;s typical. But lots of people view science with a religious mentality even tho science is not as religious. People don&#39;t read studies much. And they definitely aren&#39;t skeptical as much as they should be about studies. Even tho it&#39;s corrupt and lots of scandals occurred. Specifically because of the incentives provided. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Should be classified as A mental illness&quot; not The mental illness. You seem to be projecting the standards and limitations you have imposed on yourself onto a universal backdrop of mental illness. Do I agree with your assertion that our society lacks a common or accepted path for genuine fulfillment, I do. And I agree that we stigmatize mental illness in an incredibly unhealthy way that leads &quot;sufferers&quot; to take on unfair identities that not only do not serve them but lead to greater feelings of isolation and &quot;otherness&quot;. Just look at the fact that the first Psych wards were in abandoned leper houses in the 1400s or that the US government was sterilizing psych patients (particularly schizophrenics) as undesirable not even 100 years ago. </p>

<p>How ever to say that society is responsible for you being in a job and life that bored you to the point of depressive mania is exactly the attitude that keeps you in that state. You a responsible for the career path and lifestyle choices you have made. If it&#39;s not working for you go live with fisherman in Panama or nomadic farmers in the Mongolian steppe. Maybe those examples don&#39;t work for you but the point is if you&#39;re not happy about the conditions of your life and who those conditions make you become the changes you need to make to free yourself have to happen in YOUR LIFE not society, your friends, your lovers and certainly not in the rhetoric of an anonymous Reddit user. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t really have a job. I just realized that I can&#39;t be a neuro-theorist because everyone incentivizes products and fake productivity. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t work an office job and I don&#39;t browse Reddit at a job. I&#39;m generalizing to others. It&#39;s a common theme of the working class. It&#39;s a meme even. </p>

<p>All mental illness is mislabeled. Illness is the wrong word. There are cases maybe where things become too extreme. Mostly like parkinsons or huntingtons. Other problems seem like genetic variations that were excluded from society as a functioning demographic. The stress of being rejected socially destroys their ability to be useful on any level. Eventually isolation will lead them to being almost retarded. </p>

<p>I am going to function well in my life eventually. I already make money producing music so partly I am successful at having what is normally considered a &quot;fun&quot; job. But yet I am still upset. Because of the election. Because people are in mass hysteria. Because I can never meet people on my level of energy for intellectual topics, in real life. Sometimes I do. But often people get weird. I&#39;ve been told I&#39;m just arrogant. I get linked to r/iamverysmart. I was bullied as kid for this too somewhat. I was hyperactive. I got diagnosed with ADHD. Essentially society deemed me problematic early on. </p>

<p>But yet when I got diagnosed I scored as 99th percentile on every topic except spelling. After being bullied I went psychotic from the loneliness. I grew paranoid and distrustful of my peers. </p>

<p>Later I snapped out of this and have not returned to the full degree that it was before. </p>

<p>But now I get musicians who want to work with me and suck so it gets awkward and tense. I try to talk about psychology with some people but everyone gets pissed eventually. </p>

<p>I feel forced into conversations like &quot;hi how are you doing? Oh same as always? Oh hi how are doing now? Same again? Hi how are you? Ok&quot;. </p>

<p>It&#39;s like why? Who actually opts for this kind of existence? Then they are always insecure too. </p>

<p>I&#39;m afraid to meet people now and I am starting to lose any personality I had. But I&#39;m constantly thinking deeply about things and writing them down in journals. </p>

<p>I&#39;m just pissed at how lonely I feel forced to live. So now I resent people and judge them without even knowing them probably. I&#39;m sure there&#39;s tons like me. </p>

<p>It&#39;s just annoying that I basically have to keep my mouth shut all day with people because my ideas are too irrelevant to them or they are jealous. I&#39;ve had people tell me they are jealous and I&#39;ve had others tell me that people are being jealous or egotistic. I don&#39;t even care tho. I&#39;m sick of this. Their ego is a mental illness which prevents intellectual growth and causes intellectual &#39;hiding&#39;. </p>

<p>Anyone could do what I&#39;m doing but they just want to be &#39;normal&#39;. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not meaning to General ALL mental illness. Why did my autocorrect capitalize the General? </p>

<p>I also came from foster care and a homeless drug addict mother who died in recent years. Now I&#39;m even more alone. </p>

<p>Mental illness? Or circumstance? </p>

<p>I will do fine in my future and my end goal is to be a theorist in neuroscience and to help birth AI and push for the singularity. It&#39;s all I truly care about. I&#39;m just annoyed because I suck at taking the steps to get there. I got impatient and researched on my own about neuroanatomy and pharmacology. No One is going to believe me or care. Most people even think it&#39;s too abstract of a subject and that I&#39;m wasting time in society. It ruins me tho. No one values me except internet strangers. Teachers I talk to seem to get uneasy and insecure. So now I fear talking to them cuz it&#39;s so shameful and awkward. </p>

<p>I&#39;ll get over all this once my life is stable tho. </p>

<p>Wow I&#39;m really venting. </p>

<p>&quot;The level of denial they are in should be classified as a mental illness&quot; does not imply &quot;people with mental illness are dumb and/or in that level of denial&quot;, just as &quot;missing a limb should be classified as a disability&quot; does not imply &quot;people with a disability are missing a limb&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well it is an implied generalization. Not that people with mental illness is in denial, normal people are in denial constantly. The whole society who judges mentally ill are in denial. Denial is extremely common. </p>

<p>The idea is that mental illness is something you can be classified as. Which implies a lot. The use of mental illness in this context is the generalization. </p>

<p>You could replace their sentence as &quot;wow these people are really like crazy people&quot;. </p>

<p>You could get technical and argue that they actually see mental illness not as a category of human but it seems implied. </p>

<p>This categorization is ridiculous tho. </p>

<p>Missing a limb may be a disability automatically but depression, mania, psychosis, anxiety, are not necessarily a disability until the environment is a thing. It&#39;s usually a lack of control or lack of fitting in or simply being upset with the status quo. Mental illness arguably is a problem with the status quo. </p>

<p>And the status quo is surely broken. Moreso than the people who suffer from it. The status quo creates problems. Our environment for all of human history is tough and creates these issues. </p>

<p>But what is really the issue now, is that humans who lack empathy or intelligence are the environment that sickens these people. </p>

<p>And it&#39;s worse that we deal with the sickened people directly rather than deal with their causes. </p>

<p>Then we even convince people of this &quot;chemical induction model&quot; for illness. Which CAN be a case because I&#39;ve experienced this BUT it&#39;s not so simple. Usually chemicals are preventing us from realizing that we are upset or have helped us cope. The difference with chemical induced depression and anxiety is moreso that we lose our coping chemicals. </p>

<p>I think it&#39;s undeniable how bad society is currently. The lack of utopia is evidence. In utopia, could mental illness still exist as a chemical model? I don&#39;t think so. I think extra chemicals or lack of chemicals simply changes our sensitivity to the environment and control the biases, positive or negative, to which we see the world. </p>

<p>The problem is always going to be the world for the most part. </p>

<p>This excludes maybe someone who is depressed for their own body but then, why would that ever happen? If someone lost a limb in utopia, would it even matter? Do they need their limb? What if we created a society that associated your ego and reputation to your limbs? In fact we do have this society. </p>

<p>Now the person without limbs might be heavily damaged by social and workplace factors. Everyone gets sensitive and awkward about it too. By giving extra concern and sensitivity it simply makes the person more aware of their &quot;problem&quot;. Then all of society is designed with limbs in mind. </p>

<p>But it&#39;s still not comparable. In early humanity, most of these mental illnesses could arguably be beneficial traits. I&#39;ve written about this a lot in the past. </p>

<p>I use animals as a way to show the genetic benefits of schizophrenic traits. They are intended to be rare individuals who function as the &quot;hyperaware&quot; person. The prophet of society. Meaning scientists too. Pattern finders, but not necessarily patterns. Simply being aware will show you patterns without effort. Most of us go numb to our environment. </p>

<p>In psychology this measure is called latent inhibition. Schizophrenics and ADHD people lack the latent inhibition. This means they will constantly perceive the environment as un-learned. There is many benefits to this. </p>

<p>The problem is our society decided to drop these people out. Our society is built for numb people. And they might even be convinced that being numb is superior. Then the schizo goes insane simply by not being able to understand the number existence. Can&#39;t empathize. Or else it becomes paranoia. When we assume others will think highly theoretical and associative. Because people appear simple on the outside. So they must be secretly hiding their deep thinking side. Or you assume they are in fact, simple. Making you grandiose asshole. </p>

<p>Both grandiosity and paranoia are symptoms of schizophrenia. And bipolar. Maybe this dichotomy of choice is exactly why. The dichotomy of empathizing with &quot;normies&quot;. </p>

And the fact that according to globe theory the center of earth is zero gravity which means it must be hollow, but hollow center can&#39;t hold the rest of the mass together using a gravity pull, it would have to use surface tension or something like a balloon, so the whole thing falls apart whatever way you want to look at it.

<p>No seriously though -- Of all the regular shapes a sphere has the lowest possible surface area to volume ratio -- there is a reason bubbles are fucking spheres. If FE ppl agree the moon and sun are spheres, they have to at least see the absurdity. </p>

<p>I can&#39;t see how they could believe the sun and moon are spheres but the earth is flat. It&#39;s just too absurd. They must think the moon and sun are flat... which is even more absurd imho.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well no, this is only for gases. This is why a balloon is round, but if you drop sand to the ground in the medium of air or water, it falls in a flat manner and forms a flat surface on the ground, hence flat earth. </p>

<p>Why doesn&#39;t sand form a ball then? because of the weight of the particles pushing down as weight pushes down due to the net buoyancy being negative with an acceleration of 9.8m/s<sup>2.</sup> The earth doesn&#39;t pull us but rather pushes things. Weight pushes on earth and earth pushes in reaction. Earth also repels things due to its magnetism. It never pulls things just like a carpet doesn&#39;t pull a person but a person stands on the carpet. A toy windup car is not being pulled by a wall for example. It&#39;s like when you push a rock it pushes back in reaction. The rock doesn&#39;t pull you. Only a psychic rock could possibly manipulate your free will in order to make it push you which could technically be considered the rock pulling you, but I don&#39;t like quantum physics because that&#39;s mostly bullshit and philosophy should stay in the realm of philosophy. Gravity is false. Earth is flat. The sky is also flat as perspective makes the earth and sky appear curved to us as distant objects appear lower. Science is wrong.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>For number one I&#39;ve heard this during an argument. They are also flat just like earth. Nasa and space programs are a lie, can&#39;t leave the dome surrounding earth. The moon looks the same all the time because it&#39;s flat like earth and so we obviously see the same thing all time. The sun may look round or sphere like but it&#39;s a flat circle pointed towards us as well.</p>

<p>The mental gymnastics do answer the question and support the laughable theory, so they at least tried.</p>

<li><p>Why is a nebula galaxy flat as a pancake? By that logic if those nebula pics are real,can&#39;t the earth be flat too then if its in a flat galaxy?!?</p></li>
<li><p>Yes. Winter is Here. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>It&#39;s really just darkness and ice due to lack of sunlight, as the sky is flat so you won&#39;t run into any dome or stars etc. even if you went really far.</p>

<ol>
<li>Well okay, so science doesn&#39;t know. Scripture says it was first reddish smoke then this came together due to forces of nature and formed the earth first, then the stars and sky objects were created from that and are held aloft without any physical support or pillars. All the sky objects like stars and sun and moon have their own circular orbits and measured paths. The world is like a skyscraper with seven star layers and earth is the bottom ground floor. </li>
</ol>

<p>The earth and sky layers are actually flat planes but appear curved to us due to perspective which makes distant objects appear lower, so the distant ground and distant stars appear lower than they actually are. You are welcome :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The bible has some interesting verses where it compares earth multiple things being flat. like &quot;clay under a seal&quot;. think if pressing down on molding clay with  a seal ( in the bible, seal means ring). The bible says there are four horsemen, red white black pale. The pale horse, or the horse of death, controls a quarter of the earth. but pale in greek, the language the bible first translated too, is chloros, which means green or pale. they never saw a green horse so they put pale. there are many words that were mistranslated, as the bible was not written in english. Also islam&#39;s sacred color is green, and the earths population is about 25% of the earth. coincidence? i think not. so if you dont think the bible is true, then explain how this coincidence was out in the bible thousands of years ago. </p>

<p>Hollow Earth is central to Nazi Occult beliefs. Thule, Shambhala , Agartha, are all parts of the same Aryan mythology Nazi Occultists and their precursors believed. Flat Earth is a variation of the Hollow Earth conspiracy. Both go back centuries. In fact, many Flat Earthers believe also in the Hollow Earth.</p>

<p>I flew that route multiple times 2005-2008 while studying in Australia, so I&#39;m convinced. Maybe you should try booking it and filming it since you seem to be the person that literally believes the earth is flat. </p>

<p>This is a conspiracy theory that&#39;s even more stupid than the delusional stuff that many seem to often believe here. Normally, a conspiracy theory has a reason for its existense, there&#39;s visible unexplained smoke, and people try to theorize how the smoke is generated and come up with conspiracy theories. JFK is killed, people theorize about a government cover up assuming they are covering their own tracks. What I don&#39;t get here is: where&#39;s the smoke that makes you imagine a flat earth &#39;fire&#39;? Why would governments spend enormous amounts of rsources to keep this &#39;fact&#39; from the public? What are they protecting by conjuring up this unbelievable story of the earth being a spinning sphere? Simply put: what is the motivation for this conspiracy? what do the conspirators gain? <strong>Cui bono?</strong></p>

<p>No it isn&#39;t that&#39;s ridiculous. I don&#39;t believe you actually believe that. No CGI ever made is good enough to make the video I linked.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>just going directly to something you know will be rejected by someone who questions the globe model.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I thought perhaps you hadn&#39;t seen the video before and it&#39;s my favorite video to show globe deniers because it stands up to every criticism other video/pictures receive because it&#39;s unedited and uninterrupted and long enough to not be on some parabolic flight or underwater. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I also did not see the earth spinning whatsoever.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That would be because the ISS is going extremely fast in the same direction as the Earth.</p>

<p>Regardless if the Earth IS round as seen in the video then it also has to be spinning for everything we observe to be true. Sunrise, sunset, stars moving around, etc.</p>

<p>Sorry for trying to address and give you :</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I guess short of sending you into space yourself nothing will ever convince you because &quot;NASA always lies&quot; and &quot;Anything I see can be CGI&quot;. Fair enough </p>

<p>The planet is in frame for like 20 seconds....and the ISS is moving faster than the Earth&#39;s spin actually. You can tell in the video they are moving in relation to Earth.</p>

<p>Why do they do such a bad job making the &quot;fakes&quot; you guys love to harp about if they have such great technology? If it is CGI why didn&#39;t they make the clouds move? Is it not more likely that that is just what it looks like to look out the window of the ISS and your little nitpicks probably come from ignorance?

My hope wasn&#39;t that you would see the video and instantly believe but at least if you hadn&#39;t seen to perhaps give you something that is pretty rock solid. </p>

<p>The only deflection possible from the video is &quot;NASA is evil and CGI&#39;s everything&quot;. If that is where your head is at then there is nothing that will ever convince you other than going to space yourself. </p>

<p>Well...maybe a private space company taking a picture from space like SpaceX? If SpaceX showed a picture of the Earth from space would you believe that or are they in on it too?</p>

Thanks for attacking me instead of what I say. You think through &quot;confirmation bias&quot; I suddenly decided to change my entire view of the cosmos in such a way that I cannot talk to anybody I love and care about when it comes to my view. This is because I would get the same response as what you give me here. No one wants to listen but I&#39;m sure it&#39;s cuz I only listen to sources that I agree with. Just so you know I have a hard time believing any true human who questions the globe was raised that way.

<p>Even better, if they can&#39;t see the North Star because of perspective, why does it only apply to things on the opposite hemisphere of the viewer? Australia is very far away from both Africa and South America on the flat Earth, but &quot;perspective&quot; doesn&#39;t effect that..</p>

<p>I mean, besides that it&#39;s on the Brazilian flag and all lol, you could see it if you were in the southern Hemisphere yourself if you wanted to. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigma_Octantis">This</a> wiki page has its coordinates.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The perception of opposite directions is untrue, how would this work on a globe??</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I dont understand why you all say this, it&#39;s a commonly observed fact and is actually only explainable using a globe. <a href="https://chizzlewit.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/pole-star-motion.png">Here&#39;s</a> a diagram for your reference.</p>

<p>Take literally any object that spins around an axis. If you observe it from one side of the axis, it will rotate clockwise. If you view it from the opposite side of the axis, it will rotate counter clockwise. This isn&#39;t some magical concept, you can observe this with literally any spinning object.</p>

<p>You know there are a lot of videos of the <a href="https://youtu.be/z4TwQiiMGFw">star trail in the southern hemisphere</a> on YouTube? And would you look at that, clockwise rotation.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>They obviously can&#39;t see the same constellations</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And yet, they do. Almost like the world is a globe, seeing as that would easily explain it..</p>

<blockquote>
<p>it flies in a straight line</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Disregarding the technicalities of that, if it flew in a straight line over a flat Earth map, it would fly over Saudi Arabia and northern Africa. Why does it route near Antarctica? No plane has a fuel capacity that would suit that flight, and it would be considerably longer.</p>

<p>Because no passenger airplane has the fuel capacity to do that on a flat Earth model. It&#39;s significantly further away. Also, they fly near Antarctica on that flight, which would only make sense on a round Earth. If it was flat, they&#39;d fly over the Middle East area.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve looked at many Flat Earth maps. And there&#39;s another problem, if the Earth is flat, why is there <em>no</em> maps that are accurate to scale on a Flat Earth? The ones you guys keep using have South Africa almost twice the size of Europe, and none of the distances between continents match up. </p>

<p>This is such a dumb statement. Are you talking solely about computing power alone? Or are you generalizing all of the various technologies in the space shuttle and equating it to the modern cell phone (rocket science, etc)? Because obviously modern cell phones don&#39;t require any of that other technology required by a space shuttle. And why do you feel that a space shuttle should require more computing technology than was available to them at the time? Do you even know enough about the science behind the shuttle in the first place, or are you just being intentionally ignorant about it when you make a statement like that?</p>

Can you please explain to me why it is that the space shuttle requires more computing power than the modern cell phone?

<p>I can admit to not knowing enough about astrophysics to explain those things to you.

<p>Perhaps because they have no real reason to repeat that same mission again at the present time? Maybe they&#39;d rather spend their resources doing different things in order to learn new shit about our solar system...like exploring Mars or the moons of Jupiter or something.</p>

<p>Just because computers now are much more powerful than they were back then, doesn&#39;t mean they didn&#39;t have enough computing power at the time to achieve space travel.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not a bad spread, tbh. The order is in magnitude of difficulty to explain, as well. Although, I&#39;d probably steer away from that last argument. Spreading arguments works best when you know there&#39;s only one or two good defenses to the attack: explaining the EFEs, radiation, photography, and tidal locking. But, the last can be answered with anything ranging from IR to financing, meaning someone could try to spin it on its head. ex: the arms race gives credence to manned flights, as the fall of the USSR in &#39;91 leading to little more than Mir and ISS crew rotations from RUS proves the USA succeeded in dismantling the Soviets, and therefore had no need to press its expeditions further.</p>

<p>Why would God create an infinite flat plane with a limited space on which we can live? Why would God create the &quot;heavens and the Earth&quot; and the heavens aren&#39;t even real? The thing I do not understand about the religious angle of the flat Earth is that it puts God in a very tiny box. It says he basically made a giant snowglobe and cool light show at night.

    <div class="md"><p>My understanding of FE theorists is they argue that there are no actual photos of earth from space, flat or round. And among their supporting evidence is an article from NASA from its graphic artist who says that he takes hard data collected NASA and turns that into a graphical representation suggesting that all photos of earth from space are artistic representation of data. So can we non-believers prove that any supposed photos of earth from space is an actual unedited photo or artistic representation?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>At the same time, no one has produced a photo of the globe earth that isn&#39;t a photoshop composite. Now I&#39;m not saying it&#39;s a globe, or oblong spheroid, or pear shaped, or torus shaped, or a bubble, or what have you. Not a single person in this thread can verify it either way, with the constant fish eye lens on space fairing vehicles, to the absurdity of the ISS, to the minute amount of the population that even &quot;visits&quot; low earth orbit, we really can&#39;t say one way or the other.</p>

<p>We don&#39;t really know, we can only take people&#39;s word for it, the Michelson Morely experiment gave evidence that the Earth doesn&#39;t move as fast as it&#39;s calculated to. You can&#39;t see the curvature of the earth from any vantage point, and you&#39;re also not allowed to go rummaging through Antarctica. </p>

<p>I have no bone in this fight, but to claim something without proper verification is silly, not to mention for all practical intents and purposes, the world may as well be flat, we do not feel it&#39;s motion, nor does it affect us in our ability to navigate it. Aside from some superficial astrology our interaction with the cosmos is limited.</p>

<p>Why does it matter to you what the shape of this pile of dirt is? Does it stop you from being a human work unit if it&#39;s flat or round? Does it stop you from questioning things if it&#39;s flat or round?
What evidence do you have for it being a CIA psy-op?</p>

<p>The same effect that allows Chicago to be seen from Detroit(atmospheric lensing), I suppose it works both ways.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying the Earth is flat, or round, I&#39;m saying we&#39;re being lied to.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A flat earth would affect our ability to navigate it. It would be very hard to fly beyond the edges. Another huge practical effect would be that the sun would never set.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The sun would set if it moves far enough away from you, it wouldn&#39;t set if you assume the sun is really 93 million miles away, if it&#39;s closer and smaller than we&#39;ve been told then yes it would set if it moves far enough away.</p>

<p>How many commercial flights fly over the south pole again? You may be right, however 100% of all flights do not cross Antarctica, so it&#39;s a moot point.</p>

<p>The one expedition that tried to fly past Antarctica (Admiral Richard Byrd) said they discovered a land mass the size of the United States.</p>

<p>Just something that raises some questions. Again I&#39;m not saying that one is true or the other, rather what they tell us has the flavor of bullshit. I&#39;d like to know more, but it&#39;s not practical for me to find out. &quot;Astronauts&quot; are unique company, there are currently more people that cry tears made of glass than there are astronauts.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Alright fair, I can&#39;t prove, at least not now, that the city was not visible due to curvature, could&#39;ve been some other phenomenon.</p>

<p>About the sun. In a FE model, what explains the different angles we see the sun from different points on Earth? Close to the equator it pretty much raises up vertical, overhead and then sets vertical too. Where I live, up North, the angle is very shallow, and in mid summer it never sets.</p>

<p>Here in the northern parts of the Earth that&#39;d be easier to explain, but what kind of movement of the Sun above a FE would explain both?</p>

<p>In the video you gave you can see the horizon is not straight, but is straight shortly after launch (not during, the mountains skew the view). There are many moments where the horizon is quite level with the camera horizontal so it should not be the lens, also the curvature would be identical in lower altitudes if it was the lens.</p>

<p>No doubt we are being lied to, I am not just even a bit sure this is one of the lies. I haven&#39;t seen any evidence that points to a FE model, or anything close to it. You&#39;re right though flights over the Antarctica don&#39;t happen that often (if ever assuming FE).</p>

<p>Not conclusive, it still could be the lens.</p>

<p>Why wouldn&#39;t Felix be able to flip his visor up? I would assume it was pressurized close to 1 atm so there would be no trouble doing so. If you mean if it was a dangerous design to even allow for that then I don&#39;t know, maybe I would&#39;ve had another layer of glass behind the sun visor.</p>

<p>Would you say a non spherical Earth model is likely because of all the circumstantial evidence, or is there something concrete that you know?</p>

<p>If the Earth was flat or a dome (not sure what you meant with a bubble) flight routes close to Antarctica should be a lot longer in length than they are. As far as I know they are the exact same length as a similar route on the northern hemisphere.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The flat Earth model commonly has the sun orbiting above the plane of the earth. However we can clearly observe with any sunset that the sun is, while remaining the same size (barring relatively minor changes due to atmospheric moisture) that it was throughout the day, passing behind the visible horizon. As this occurs a shadow is cast by the occluding land which be observed on the clouds above us moving towards the horizon well after the sun is no longer visible.</p>

<p>Record the time of sunset and travel west as far as you can, or just enlist the real-time observation of someone you trust who lives much further east or west. The sun will be visible to them when it is not visible to you.</p>

<p>These two easily observed phenomena cannot both occur on a flat plane. They can occur on a cylinder or a sphere.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree that it&#39;s presumptuous to declare FE-theory as dumb by default, but there is a difference between the science of physical laws and measurements and the study of history.</p>

<p>By its very nature, history can only be interpreted by what was written about and what we can extrapolate from archeological relics. This makes it pretty easy to omit crucial pieces of information and to spin information into a misleading narrative.</p>

<p>Physical sciences function on observations, predictions and experiments that are falsifiable and repeatable. Some observable phenomena can be explained with conventional cosmology as well as within the FE paradigm (the typical experiment of the differently long shadows thrown by obelisks in two separate places works with a distant sun and a round earth as well as with a close and comparatively tiny sun and a flat earth), while other phenomena still evade explanation in either paradigm.</p>

<p>Things such as the round shadow during a lunar eclipse, however, make a ball-earth simply more likely.</p>

<p>Still, it&#39;s not unreasonable to assess that most of our history is distorted while dismissing FE theory based on empirical observations.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s funny how most of these science critics have zero comprehension of the differences between the soft and hard sciences. Natural sciences are based on experiments that can be repeated by others at other times and in other locations and still achieve the same results. Social sciences on the other hand, including history, are more like pseudo-science and don&#39;t have the repeatability of natural sciences. So yeah, history is based on subjective interpretation of limited information, often from dubious and disputed sources, while astronomy is a matter of measurable data with far less room for subjectivity. They are not comparable in any meaningful way.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been trying not to fall down the flat earth rabbit hole. I was too advocating that it was a psy ops. But maybe it is their intention for us to believe that it&#39;s a psy op to distract us from the real truth. (Which honestly none of you redditors are probably ready to handle if I told you flat out right now) lol </p>

<p>Reasons I&#39;ve been thinking this
1) it works with astrology ( I&#39;m an amateur astrologer and I looked up to see how the planets would work or be a factor if the earth were flat 
2) the Simpsons have that one weird episode where the baseball hits the globe top (glass sky) and water comes pouring in (something that references to FE) 
3) Tila Tequila has been (scaringly enough) making more sense to me in her 2017 vlogs on her YT channel (I started watching it after she addressed Kanyes Mk ultra breakdown) 
And in some of her videos she does reference the earth is flat (but there are also multiple parallel universes/earths) and that we are under water.</p>

<p>She is also super up to date with pizzagate. 
I think she&#39;s some next level shit though because she&#39;s been talking about government and CIA stuff since 2013. </p>

<p>Flat earth is psyop. It indeed can sound convincing, but...</p>

<p>If the earth was flat normal people like fisherman and oil exploration companies would constantly be finding out. It&#39;s not something anyone would shrug off. They&#39;re expecting the coastline of antartica and the southern islands to be the way it is on all maps, but instead it encircles the globe?  The distances between all locations would be wrong. If you were krill fishing, landed in the south georgia island and then headed towards anouther island it would be much farther away than you expected.</p>

<p>Look at the lsit of islands. A flat earth means that ALL the distances between them are drastically underestimated. Satalite photos of the antartic ocean would all have to be doctored.</p>

<p>If flat earth is true, I&#39;d expect there to be lots of inconsistencies. Is there a single example of satallite photos showing different relationships between these islands?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the term &quot;flat earth&quot; is the psyop personally. Even the folks who study and discuss the place we live know it isn&#39;t &quot;flat&quot;. There&#39;s mountains and valleys, not a flat plane. </p>

<p>It&#39;s better described as a frisbee with the edge being an ice and snow ring keeping the oceans inside. And theres no magic glass globe over us. The &quot;firmament&quot; is just the frequency resonance, or maybe the edge of the magnetosphere where the torroidal field ends. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not a flat earther, or a ball earther, or a concave earther, or an innerearther (possibly a simulation theory-er, maybe a believer in electric universe). But I sure do enjoy the mind candy that is THINKING of what it all COULD be. When we get into conflict is when we try to say with certianty what we live on. Not even the all powerful NASA can give us 1 simple unedited, non composite, taken from a camera, photo. None exist. CGI and composites are all we get. </p>

<p>Doesn&#39;t that make the folks sure of a ball just as &quot;gullible&quot; as flat earthers? Afterall, nobody goes out to prove the globe to themselves unless something happens to make them question the globe to begin with. Why would they? They were raised to believe we live on a ball, no need to question. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lol foreign agent, that&#39;s a new one.</p>

<p>There are tons of flaws that any rudimentary knowledge of astronomy would have provided you (since they have been discussed for hundreds of years by people such as Copernicus, Galileo, and Kepler)</p>

<p>Some really obvious ones would be:</p>

<p>*We can observe moons orbiting other planets, like Jupiter</p>

<p>*It can&#39;t explain why planets are brighter when opposite the sun in the sky</p>

<p>*Cannot explain the phases of Venus</p>

<p>*Elipsies explained planetary motion far better than retrograde motion</p>

<p>These are all <strong>very simple</strong> observations that anyone can make themselves and has been for a loooong time. I didn&#39;t even get into gravity and how there is no solid theory for a mechanism behind geocentric motion</p>

<p>Yes. Your camera has a 1/2.3&quot; sensor. Compare your sensor <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_sensor_format">to other camera sensors,</a> and you&#39;ll see that your equipment could use a lot of improvement.</p>

but if they find evidence, by all means I&#39;m listening.
It is quite suspicious that the Earth has never had a full photo taken of it, that is not a lame CGI/composite.
For people to dismiss other theories so quickly may be a mistake.
I&#39;m open minded to different ideas as long as there&#39;s reasonable doubt against NASA.</p>

<p>I currently think the Earth is a globe but considering NASA can&#39;t be trusted, I&#39;ll be researching other theories that could explain why the hell NASA hasn&#39;t given us a proper photo of the Earth.</p>

<p>A decent guess could be that the Earth is spherical but we can&#39;t get past a certain point, hence fake Moon landings.
Or it could be even more messed up and be both that the Earth is not spherical AND we can&#39;t
get past a certain point.
I remain open minded, I don&#39;t trust NASA but I also don&#39;t trust
the Flat Earth idea (for now, since it sounds sort of psyops-ey)
but I don&#39;t know for certain yet.</p>

Yes, the latter is a composite in the sense that it combines red, green and blue channel pictures. But combining channels is how every digital camera works anyway.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I researched those a while ago and I&#39;m almost positive they&#39;re both composites.
Not sure what you mean about combining filters but stitching together photos to bring about the blue marble is not the same as taking a full real photo from a good distance above the Earth.
If NASA wasn&#39;t even bothered to take a photo of the Earth when going to the Moon, that makes me think either they couldn&#39;t due to it being impractical somehow or a conspiracy relating to either the shape of the Earth, it&#39;s position in space, and/or how far away we can actually go beyond the atmosphere before radiation and other hazards get too high.
I don&#39;t believe humans landed on the Moon.
It looks like a good fake, perhaps using Kubrick&#39;s method of a fake background (can&#39;t remember the name of this technique)
but I did wonder something....</p>

<p>If the most reasonable explanation was that the Earth is spherical but humans can&#39;t go past a certain radiation threshold....
maybe that links with flat Earth.
Perhaps flat Earth is a psyop to discredit people who think the Moon landings were fake? (By associating the two, making them both sound like crazy ideas).</p>

<p>Just a thought. 
Considering I&#39;ve gone down the Saturn Moon matrix theory, I remain cautiously open minded to any theory with some logical basis.</p>

Why not take a photo of the Earth half way to the Moon or some shit? Lack of good Earth photos is very suspicious.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How is that a stupid comment? It&#39;s true. A spherical earth has been something known for thousands of years. The amount of people who have worked on this subject and researched it are in the millions. It would require everyone to be in on it. It&#39;s not that far of a fetched claim.</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah, the corrupt banking system sooooo required thousands of years to work. ....Why are you even on /conspiracy?&quot;
I don&#39;t know exactly what you&#39;re talking about here? Are you referring to some sort of global bank that dominates the world?
If so, that is definitely different. The &quot;corrupt banking system&quot; hasn&#39;t been the same exact concept and entity for thousands of years. Additionally, it&#39;s a completely different subject. It&#39;s not something supported by thousands of scientific conclusions, many of which have been discovered independent of each other. </p>

<p>Why don&#39;t you stay focused on the topic at hand? A better comparison, would be to find something else agreed upon in the scientific community for thousands of years, with independent conclusions, that has been proven false.</p>

<p>..Not with a brightly lit object in the foreground. You need short shutter speed otherwise it&#39;ll overexpose and the whole picture will just be white. If you want a photo of the earth, you&#39;re not going to see stars.</p>

<p>Dodging is a thing. So are actual glass filters.

<p>&quot;the Earth deviates from a perfect sphere by only a third of a percent&quot; you&#39;re not going to see that with the naked eye, no way.</p>

<p>No because they&#39;re trying to take pics of the Earth, the stars don&#39;t matter. I grant you that dodging would be good, and it would be a beautiful picture with the stars too.</p>

<p>Why? As far as NASA is concerned any reasonable person knows the earth is spherical (why do boats disappear bottom up? I&#39;ve had people say perspective, fog, waves combining... all extremely flawed explanations) with their very limited money, there&#39;s no point in doing that.</p>

<p>All of these people just seem to be really shit at maths... i.e. take a look at the description of the second video. The guy uses &#39;Dubay&#39;s formula&#39; to calculate the curvature. Now, google that. Zero results, it&#39;s not a real formula, he&#39;s plucked 32 ft out of thin air. The Earth is gigantic, obviously over just 7 miles the curve is tiny. </p>

<p>Watch the second vid, it&#39;s really stupid, particularly at 5:29 when they claim &#39;the zero g plane is climbing&#39; huh?? And the toy, mic, hair, necklace, etc. still as as if they&#39;re in zero g while it climbs? Dumb point. Plus zero g planes only experience zero g for ~30 seconds at a time before having to climb again.</p>

<p>And hairspray? Hair looks nothing like that with huge amounts of spray in, it goes crispy and stays in place - it wouldn&#39;t wave around like that. Washing hair: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOIj7AgonHM">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOIj7AgonHM</a></p>

<p>It&#39;s explaining that the sun is a spotlight and never crosses the moon, yet offers no scientific explination as to how that works. You don&#39;t need pictures to see the earth&#39;s shadow move across the moon, or to see the moon cross the sun.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>there are many questions left unanswered, in both the globe and flat earth theories.</p>

<p>for example, the tides have never been explained adequately by the globe earth model. nor do they explain why the light of the moon has differing qualities to that of the sun. Why are sun and moon the exact same size in the sky? globe earth theory says that it&#39;s &quot;pure coincidence&quot; and that has no other meaning.</p>

<p>as far as eclipses are concerned there are many possible explanations. It is an assumption to say that the darkness on the moon during an &quot;eclipse&quot; is the shadow cast by the earth. </p>

<p>Sun and Moon aren&#39;t the same side in the sky and that&#39;s obvious because when you see a total solar eclipse you still see a ring of light around the moon where it doesn&#39;t completely cover the sun.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, and those 2 high tides happen when the moon is above and the other when it&#39;s on the other side, since the earth rotates you get that. The phase of the moon only effects it in that it will occur at different times of day. </p>

<p>Objects reflect light? thanks for that. Didn&#39;t think of it.</p>

<p>The light of the moon is cooling. It is warmer in the shade of a full moon than being exposed to the full moonlight. How do you explain this?</p>

<p>The sun and moon are the same size. And you can look it up or measure it yourself. The viewable size of both the sun and moon does fluctuate in small amounts. Depending on time of year/month/day.</p>

<p>You have to ask yourself &quot;what does each model imply?&quot;</p>

<p>Flat:  Earth is the center of the universe, we are created, Biblical contexts make sense (Tower of Babel, for example), life has purpose and meaning, heaven above, hell below</p>

<p>Spinning Globe:  Earth is a speck on the galactic map, atheism/evolution is truth, life is meaningless/morality is subjective, so consume consume consume, for tomorrow we die.  Oh, and hey there might be &quot;aliens&quot;.</p>

<p>Which model do you think the elites want their population thinking?  I&#39;m not saying I completely buy into either model (which is why I love the theory), but when I see people rail so much harder against it than for it I always have to stop and ponder why it bothers them so much on a personal level.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You don&#39;t need to go to space and see the earth with your own two eyes to know it&#39;s round.</p>

<p>Imagine you&#39;re in the kitchen and your friend is cooking. You can smell the chocolate and whatever is cooking in the oven. You see flour, sugar, eggs, and chocolate chips on the counter. You see the oven is on at 350F. By all intuitive measures, you can assume your friend made some chocolate chip cookies and he sure isn&#39;t making a salad.</p>

<p>Same thing with the Earth. The constellations are different between the Northern hemisphere and Southern hemisphere. Stars appear to rotate clock-wise at one pole and counter clock-wise at the other. Planes have direct flights that cover the least amount of distance traveled assuming the earth was round (e.g. look at a flight from South Africa to Australia. It flies over the South Pole. Apparently you&#39;d be flying over the giant ice wall with a flat earth model into the great nothingness beyond it). GPS and satellites. The ISS (which you can literally see with a telescope). Every other observable heavenly body that reaches a certain size is spherical. </p>

<p><em>The fucking MOON</em>. The flat earth explanation for moon phases are a god damn joke. You&#39;d be able to see BOTH sides if the Earth was flat.</p>

<p>What about seeing a ship come over the horizon (or you can even see this with large buildings from a long distance). </p>

<p><em>Fucking space travel</em> Fine, the moon landing&#39;s fake. But are you telling me there&#39;s a giant conspiracy between every single person involved in space travel and Newtonian physics? If the Earth wasn&#39;t round, none of this would work. This is seriously high school level physics.</p>

<p>The issue that I (and, I&#39;m assuming OP) take with flat earther&#39;s is their unwillingness to think critically and rationally. FE probably is a CIA psy-op so they can figure out who&#39;s stupid enough not to worry about. God damn, I fucking hate flat earth conspiracy morons.</p>

Would love the option to actually have the opportunity for both of us to go to space together and once we know together at the same time the shape of the Earth, then we&#39;ll know without any assumptions.<br/>
But that won&#39;t happen and we&#39;ll just keep proving why it&#39;s round/flat without just using our literal eyes or NASA.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I never said I knew 1000% that it&#39;s flat.<br/>
Another assumption.<br/>
What I am saying is that with all the evidence that you mention, I can see how the Earth being round is more probable. But for myself to know, the keyword here is KNOW, that it&#39;s round is insanity.<br/>
I just don&#39;t KNOW it&#39;s round.  You and I can BELIEVE all day long that it&#39;s round, flat, donut, hollow, etc but until we see it for ourselves, we just don&#39;t KNOW.<br/>
So I admitted that I don&#39;t know whether the Earth is 1000% round, flat, hollow, donut, but you can honestly say you yourself &quot;KNOW&quot; that it is?</p>

<p>But we can. A spherical model predicts all sorts of testable, and tested phenomena. Tests that you yourself can do, like going out at night and observing the circumpolar stars during different times of the year.</p>

<p>What predictions does a flat earth model predict that the spherical model doesn&#39;t?</p>

That&#39;s it. Knowing that the shadow from my point is actually Earth&#39;s shadow, is not 1000% true.<br/>
If I myself was in space, let&#39;s just say somewhere between Earth and Mars, and can literally see that the Earth&#39;s shadow is indeed the same shadow that is on the moon during an eclipse, then viola, I now know 1000% myself it is and can honestly say the Earth really is round. But having all of this faith in others&#39; proof and experiences are not good enough.<br/>
It&#39;s like Schrödinger&#39;s cat. Yeah someone else other than me opened the box and says the cat is alive and there is no need for me to look, maybe have a camera inside the box showing that the cat is alive and I&#39;m able to see the monitor displaying the video footage, and whatever other proof but why can&#39;t I just remove the box myself and see for myself if the cat is alive or not?</p>

<p>What i&#39;m trying to say is, the earth has been around for like over 4.5 billion years (unless theres another conspiracy you&#39;d like to enlighten us all with), and during those 4.5 billion years, every 24 hours it has been rotating at 1000 miles per hour. Gravity at that magnitude will sculpt anything of such a vast diameter over such a gargantuan time line in to a sphere. A sphere on which we all live.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Everything is centered on being anchored which sucks.  Even on a plane as someone else condescendingly mentioned is still &quot;anchored&quot;.<br/>
 According to the Flat Earth model, Polaris is the &quot;center&quot; of Earth and that&#39;s why you see the pictures of all the stars revolving around it.  But that&#39;s not a good enough reason to prove the Flat Earth.  I just want like ABSOLUTE UNDENIABLE proof about the shape of the Earth.

I can believe with all my heart that Guam is real and that there are pictures and videos of the country but at least I have the option of going myself today/tomorrow if I wanted to.<br/>

    <div class="md"><p>Not really. Just because something is nice and neat and simple doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s correct. And if anything when you understand gravity the globe is very simple. Why is the earth flat? Why are things attracted to the ground? With gravity you get both answers. The reason the earth is round is because that&#39;s the simplest shape all things collapse into when subjected to a force. The reason being a sphere has the least area for the most volume. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>But that&#39;s the thing: gravity is not understsndable because you can&#39;t say why it does what it does and where it comes from. If you consider that gravity could be a mere invention to explain globes, it all falls apart: the big bang, balls of fire, spheres floating out there, earth as a sphere spinning 1000 miles per hour. </p>

<p>Why is the earth flat? Why did the big bang happen? What is the meaning of life? It just is (<em>if</em> it&#39;s flat). I have creation theories, but you would consider them too out there, and nobody can be sure why the universe exists anyway whether flat earth or globe. Dense objects fall, bouyant objects float. As far as simplicity, this model is <strong>far</strong> simpler than the model preached by main stream science.</p>

Worst of all is they will throw away things that we understand only to go to a theory that has even more holes an makes less sense. </p>

<p>Edmond Halley (of Halley&#39;s comet) first noticed that stars move almost 300 years ago. A few stars in charts made by Greek sky watchers were not in quite the same location anymore. Those charts were more than 1600 years old then, and even over that time, the bright stars Sirius, Arcturus, and Aldebaran had shifted position only slightly. Still, it was enough for Halley to realize that those stars must have moved.</p>

<p>Boats appear to disappear over the horizon, when in fact you can zoom in with a camera and see them again, and see coastline beaches over a hundred miles away, which would be impossible on a globe. The bottoms of the boats appear to disappear into the water because of an illusion: you are looking across thousands of little waves; the bottom of the boat is not actually deeper in the water, but covered from view because of the crests of all those waves averaging, blocking part of the view. </p>

<p>The planets are round, just like sun and moon, but that does not prove the earth shape, only that those objects are round. </p>

<p>The flat earth sun is not 93 million miles away, but much closer and moves around right above the earth in circles, while night is where the sun isn&#39;t. Time zones and seasons are possible on this flat earth model.</p>

<p>Nope, find me a balloon moving 17000 mph <strong>around</strong> the earth then we will talk. Seriously we track this satellite (I dont want to go into too much detail) and have it take readings at certain points. There would be no way that I can think of to falsify this data. Again I can see exactly how fast its moving. </p>

<p>Yeah I would avoid youtub videos... Ive seen a few FE ones and they are dog shit for fact finding. There is a reason you wont find any papers written on Flat Earth, they are too easy to pick apart. Seriously you dont think its a bit odd that no flat earther has clearly and concisely written it out using supporting facts and proofs? You dont think its weird that youtube videos make up the preponderance of evidence?</p>

<p>You dont have to believe what scientists say, you can prove most of this yourself. youve also fallen into the issue of &quot;You cant trusst scientists but I can trust strangers on the internet!&quot; </p>

<blockquote>

<p>Kind of but the point still stands. Look at the fucking seasons argument FEers use, that is pseudo science at its best. </p>

<p>It absolutely does. Can you give an example? </p>

<p>Irrelevant point. The multiple governments with their space agencies are unable to prove a globe earth, I don&#39;t care how many answers the globe model has.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not irrelevant at all. There are multiple FE theories, none of them agree and none of them can come close to explaining the phenomena we see everyday. You might have a few good points but as a whole it is lacking. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Did I ban you?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yep, for asking 8mark why he claims its impossible for nebulae to exist. He couldnt answer and you banned me. Which I find hilarious considering this is in the side bar of your safe space</p>

<p>You should really remove that. Just browsing your sub I see barren threads where all comments have been removed and simply asking questions gets you banned. </p>

If that&#39;s true, you would not be able to get to any edge. If the earth is domed, there are increasingly difficult barriers to all edges in all directions. Even if the United States military would allow independent exploration of Antarctica, which they would not, you would face increasing altitude, and increasing extreme weather (cold and wind, thin air), and you might never reach the edge, if there even is one.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lmao the theory i heard from these nutjobs is the &quot;flat earth&quot; moves up in space at 9.81m/s LOL. Its actually fucking hilarious. Also why do they think earth is flat when they can clearly see every other planet which is round.</p>

<p>Nope...just such a waste of time. I went to visit Ephesus, and that area dates back to 10 BC. There&#39;s a statue of Emperor Trajan has his foot in a globe, as he was known to &quot;rule the world&quot;. They knew the earth was round back then. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve said this elsewhere on Reddit...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This is the new breed of conspiracy theory, a complete rejection of science and everything we&#39;ve done since the Enlightenment. This is how the elites are going to take us back to the Dark Ages. Failing school systems gives us people with uninquisitive minds that lack critical thinking skills who find information on the Internet that fills in the blanks with bullshit that reinforces beliefs that make the people feel good about themselves. One day when all of civilization is completely stupefied, when we&#39;re entirely dependent on our electronic brains to Google all the answers, the elites will turn the Internet off and the people will have no clue which way is up.</p>

<p>Also, all of this, be it Flat Earth, Mandela Effect, the belief that biology is fake and we humans are something different from other animals, all of it is about making us, and by extension the individual, the center of attention. Increasing alienation from a modern, technologically advanced society has left people feeling as though they lack meaning, all of these conspiracy theories we&#39;re discussing pertaining to a false reality, or the true nature of existence, put us at the center of something much larger and emphasize our importance. Notice none of these theories suggests the universe is chaos, flying apart in all directions as we&#39;re hurtling into infinity. Instead these beliefs organize the world in a way that reassures us everything makes sense and has a purpose, that suggests only what we can experience ourselves is real, that &quot;We&#39;re on a Flat Earth where we are at the center of the universe, we are all there is,&quot; or &quot;Reality is a &#39;Matrix,&#39; a simulation for me to explore.&quot;</p>

<p>In short, there are real conspiracies, this bullshit that rejects science, logic, reason, this is all meant to discredit us and to turn this community and the rest of the world into drooling idiots. </p>

Also, the fact that the stars move is observable, they change position in the night sky over the course of years.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The thing that makes me believe the flat earth frenzy is a psyop, is solar wind from the sun, and or CME&#39;s. It usually takes between 24-48 hours for for ejecta from the sun to reach earth and interact with the magnetic poles. If the sun were closer, as flat earth pushers state, CME&#39;s should affect us much sooner. I just find it hard to believe that all of the space weather satellites and tools are just made up. Militaries around the globe defend against solar wind all the time. It&#39;s the primary reason for the use of chemtrails. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The flat Earth model relies upon &quot;perspective&quot; to explain the sun and sunsets. I put that in quotes because they just don&#39;t understand perspective, yet reference it constantly to hand wave away issues.</p>

<p>The common flat Earth model has the sun orbiting in a circle parallel and above the plane of the earth by some 3-4000 miles (it really depends upon who you talk to. There&#39;s no real consensus and challenging them on a particular point results in a pivot of the argument)</p>

<p>This has several problems. The first being that the sun, being higher than any object on Earth should always be visible from anywhere on earth. At 3000 miles up, and, to put it as low in the sky as possible, a full circumference length of the round earth away (so basically standing on one edge of the earth and looking at the sun above the far edge of the earth opposite you), the sun will still be 6.88° above the horizon, and the angular size of the sun will be .07268°, just the tiniest dot, whereas directly above you, its angular size would be .61°, 8.39% larger, which is slightly larger than the angular size, .53°, listed on Wikipedia.</p>

<p>The second being that because the sun is never below the horizon, if your view isn&#39;t obstructed by any foreground object with an angular height greater than 6.88°, then the sun should be visible.</p>

<p>Flat earthers have a variety of explanations for this, including the sun being a giant spotlight that doesn&#39;t shine on some parts even though it should otherwise be visible. As the sun is always a circle, even when setting, this is clearly not the case. Add in the sun still illuminating the sky well after it is no longer visible and the argument just falls apart.</p>

<p>Regardless of the shape of the sun being a sphere or a circle, it maintains a consistent size, with some variation for atmospheric effects, and being perceived as larger when near the horizon due to there being something to compare it to.</p>

<p>Frankly no self respecting flat earther would accept the results of any cartography expedition, as it is too easily manipulated by whatever sinister forces are responsible for the deception. This is a very simple argument that anyone with two eyes and the ability to apply basic reasoning can understand.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do you really think flat earth can only mean the one thing you are thinking of and are seeing images of? All evidence has pointed me towards that the earth indeed is flat but everyone imagines it being a circled pancake in free space. PSY-OP worked for those people. </p>

<p>Yes earth is indeed flat, boats for example (which is one of the biggest globe proofs) is that they DO NOT go behind a curvature when you see them &quot;disappear&quot;, they gets hidden behind mirage and get very small because of the distance. This is the truth. If you observe this with instruments as P900 or look at footage of sun where you can see a clear line where the mirage is on top of the water and sun is disappearing behind the sun, and being honest, you can see that this is the case. </p>

<p>Now- there is many FE&#39;s pushing azimuthal projection with ice walls on the sides, that is the wrong model, it doesn&#39;t work because sun&amp;moon isn&#39;t doing circles like that, this is where the PSY-OP is, this is the falseness to FE, which will just confuse people and make them just leave this. And also, celestial south pole is completely ignored and/or very bad explanations, because it doesn&#39;t work. </p>

<p>All this is probably a simulation, where the sun and moon enters into the visual field of everyone. And the celestial &quot;roof&quot; is indeed rotating by its own. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m schizo and I&#39;m not this dumb, why do you make sweeping generalizations?</p>

<p>The study of mental illnesses is flawed because we never research how to live happy and enlightened but instead test different methods of treating &quot;problems&quot;. This may also provide incentives to promoting labels of mental illness because it means money. </p>

<p>Everything in psychology seems to be studied at the angle of &quot;this is a problem we need to fund research into and fix, we can&#39;t afford studying fascinating things&quot;. So this incentivizes scientists who are fascinated by something to frame it as a problem that needs a solution. </p>

<p>This can mean that symptoms of having something like schizophrenia will be diagnosed even if their life is going somewhat well. The person is conditioned to fear these symptoms for their own &quot;sanity&quot;. Social factors lead to stigma and loads of other issues like mass hysteria (witch hunt mentality). </p>

<p>Nothing is a mental illness. I&#39;m depressed daily on a chemical and external level. I actually associate my depression with society. That life is too empty, boring, meaningless, unstimulating. Like I&#39;m forced to work such a terrible job just because society can&#39;t reach utopia already. </p>

<p>I think depression regardless of chemical causes, always has a realistic basis. The chemicals just make it harder for you to find a happiness bias. Honestly it doesn&#39;t make any sense how someone could be happy in this world unless they have adapted to the corruption or learned to ignore all of the very real problems with humanity and life. </p>

<p>Psychiatry is broken because capitalism doesn&#39;t work. It&#39;s fake. Competition is a joke. </p>

<p>Are you working at a desk job and browsing Reddit all day? Is it because you enjoy this aspect of capitalism? Your a slave and it&#39;s not different than communism. The same corrupt people take power and find ways to keep the working class in agreement with their plans. </p>

<p>Your not competing. No one likes capitalism except the really high up people. Your all in denial and your just supporting these high up people because they tricked you into being delusional that you have some shot at getting rich and famous. This is the same mentality as compulsive gambling. It also relates to religious mentality. Both of these associate with novelty and the D2 dopamine receptor. This receptor is implicated in schizophrenic symptoms, addiction, religious mentality, risk taking, novelty seeking. Not all of these are in the same direction, some having negative correlation. </p>

<p>People need to stop judging mental illness. The fear and propaganda of having something like schizo pretty much worsens the condition. I&#39;m pretty sure language can be used to help most people out of their issues but we need to stop victimizing these people. </p>

<p>Schizo traits have tons of benefits. This comment shows my level of thinking for example. It&#39;s highly associative and perceptive in my opinion compared to what most others are like. Maybe it&#39;s arrogant to say that. But I also can&#39;t function with most of normal society things. But I&#39;ve learned to take my gifts and push them to their limits. </p>

<p>I&#39;m more Schizotypal so it isn&#39;t as bad. But I&#39;ve had psychosis plenty times. I know when I&#39;m in it too. I just start reducing myself. Preventing myself from concluding too many assumptions. I still feel my conclusions unfortunately. Usually paranoid. </p>

<p>After thinking so deeply constantly, I&#39;ve actually forgotten what it&#39;s like to be &quot;normal&quot;. I find it really hard to empathize now sometimes. I feel caring, but usually people&#39;s behavior does not make sense. Too much ego for example. Letting go of ego lets you come closer to an objective perspective. </p>

<p>To realize ones own potential means to stop constantly assuming a humble position for example. How come this isn&#39;t taught in therapy? Therapy just belittles people and helps them become &quot;normal&quot; and reject their gifts usually. </p>

<p>Acting humble is a barrier to true rationality. Stop caring who&#39;s better or worse and just think about how things are. Take intellectual risks. Allow yourself to look stupid or be wrong. It doesn&#39;t matter unless you harm someone. </p>

<p>Ok I&#39;m done now wow. Too much. </p>

<p>It is quite suspicious that the Earth has never had a full photo taken of it, that is not a lame CGI/composite. </p>

<p>How can you take a single picture of both sides of a sphere? Think about it...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Edgy? I just wanted to see if you had any good photographs to prove any photography knowledge. Then I checked to see if you cared about anonymity. Neither of which seem to be remotely true. </p>

<p>a la oblate spheroid</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&quot;the Earth deviates from a perfect sphere by only a third of a percent&quot; you&#39;re not going to see that with the naked eye, no way.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>they ought to be able to try a few different techniques and camera settings, no?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No because they&#39;re trying to take pics of the Earth, the stars don&#39;t matter. I grant you that dodging would be good, and it would be a beautiful picture with the stars too.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Photography and video seem so unimportant on these missions, when in actuality they would have been the MOST important things to bring back, along with rocks and dirt.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why? As far as NASA is concerned any reasonable person knows the earth is spherical (why do boats disappear bottom up? I&#39;ve had people say perspective, fog, waves combining... all extremely flawed explanations) with their very limited money, there&#39;s no point in doing that.</p>

<p>So I propose we settle this. We build a vaccum tube from America to Europe and put a telescope on one end. If I see Europe I&#39;ll concede. Case closed once and for all. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not outright saying the Earth is flat, flat as a pancake, but it&#39;s not a sphere either. Probably some other shape, bubble? Maybe there is a dome, maybe the solar system is smaller than we&#39;ve been led to believe. Maybe we have a much more advanced space program and some of it involves trans-dimensional travel. Who knows, it&#39;s not as if we can easily verify it.</p>

<p>Or maybe this is just a lonely insignificant rock spinning through space and time, and we&#39;re one in a quadrillion worlds that has life with the potential for metaphysical intellect.</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t see any curvature in that camera, at all. And why do they insist on using fish eye lens? Let the round earth speak for itself without special effects.</p>
