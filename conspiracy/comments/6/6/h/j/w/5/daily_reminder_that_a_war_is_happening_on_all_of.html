    <div class="md"><p>And soo...? You post lengthy posts to act as if you have reason within conversations and stalk people on reddit to negatively influence a political movement. You perform by posting what you want to be perceived as logical conclusions that have been well laid out and presented.. With sources, backlinks and &quot;more information.&quot; Information that typically leads to more links to more information. To more links, again.</p>

<p>Your combative efforts suggest a negative intent quite clearly. You try to associate me with the actions of the user of <a href="/u/stopgangstalking">/u/stopgangstalking</a> when flairing posts is the appropriate action to take instead of removing posts. (Even tho posts removed was agreeably disinformation and the posts of trolls and paid protesters.)</p>

<p>Gangstalking is serious business and involves a number of different efforts to ensure victims are powerless and resourceless. Paid protesting and astroturfing is a serious effort within gangstalking communities due to this fact right here. It&#39;s not that hard to find astroturf and disinformation once you recognize the signs, behaviors and trends that come up as a result of this &quot;paid protesting&quot; effort. Also with the fact that it nearly overwhelms and practically extinguishes grassroots information within the gangstalking movement it&#39;s no surprise that my efforts are belittled and sabotaged.</p>

<p><a href="/u/microwavedindividual">/u/microwavedindividual</a> is apart of that effort. Study every action this account takes to understand just that. Study the actions of many who post concerning information and rants to further understand how a movement has been ripped from the inside out from the very beginning. </p>

<p>Also <a href="/u/microwavedindividual">/u/microwavedindividual</a>... Get the fuck off my nuts. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You didn&#39;t identify any disinformation in my comments. Instead you bullied me.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t cyberstalk people. Since 2014, I have subscribed, posted and commented in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>. I certainly didn&#39;t cyberstalk you to <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>. I had commented in this post a day earlier. </p>

<p>I work hard at researching and giving information.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You try to associate me with the actions of the user of <a href="/u/stopgangstalking">/u/stopgangstalking</a></p>

<p>Are you denying you are an alt account of <a href="/u/stopgangstalking">/u/stopgangstalking</a>?</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Flairing posts as disinformation is only appropriate if you debate the disinformation and allow others to debate. Otherwise, best to remove disinformation.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>ensure victims are powerless and resourceless.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You as <a href="/u/stopgangstalking">/u/stopgangstalking</a> did that by:</p>

<p>(1) Instigating the removal of the referral to <a href="/r/targetedindividuals">/r/targetedindividuals</a> in the sidebar of <a href="/r/gangstalking">/r/gangstalking</a> with your own website stopgangstalking; and</p>

<p>(2) Instigating the removal of my post on what <a href="/r/electromagnetics">/r/electromagnetics</a> covers.</p>

<p>Both subs cover taking meter measurements and shielding. You rendered subscribers of <a href="/r/gangstalking">/r/gangstalking</a> helpless to substantiate their electronic torture and helpless to shield. <a href="/r/electromagnetics">/r/electromagnetics</a> has information on diagnosis and treatment of radio wave sickness. Your website has no information on meters, shielding and radio wave sickness.</p>

<p>I do not astroturf.  You did. You flaired <a href="/u/daryatash">/u/daryatash</a>&#39;s crosspost of this post as disinformation. If you continue to censor to self promote your website, I will debate you.</p>

Just make sure it becomes something serious that doesn&#39;t fade away after a few days/weeks. (Long-term) Consistency is key. Maybe you can work something out with the mods? Like a schedule where a few people(mods+you?) each have a day for the their daily reminder. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s a few reasons for the V2k all of which I&#39;m probably not aware of. They repeat negative phrases about the victim to affect their psyche over time, they comment on things the target is doing to keep them in a state of paranoia that they&#39;re being watched, they annoy the hell out of some victims to drive them mad or get them wrongfully committed to a crazy hospital to slander the target&#39;s reputation and/or commit more atrocities while they have them under their control there, and lastly it&#39;s so others dismiss these claims as schizophrenia so they don&#39;t look any further.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Right, so acctual people are harrassing them(which can be recorded and confirmed or something)? Because if it&#39;s in their head i&#39;m confused as to how you would determine if it isn&#39;t just a mental illness instead of being targeted by this. Assuming you acknowledge that mental illness is a thing, which happens to people. I&#39;m not saying this isn&#39;t happening, just that it is very similar to some very specific symptoms. Some of which im currently experiencing and im in the process of being diagnosed, kinda why this peaked my interest.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><a href="/u/daryatash">/u/daryatash</a> should have referred articles on microwave auditory effect and submit a written meter report. Microwave auditory effect can be measured with a meter.</p>

<p>[WIKI] DEW: Microwave Auditory Effect also known as voice to skull (V2K) </p>

<p><a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/TargetedEnergyWeapons/comments/59q3qi/wiki_dew_microwave_auditory_effect_also_known_as/">https://np.reddit.com/r/TargetedEnergyWeapons/comments/59q3qi/wiki_dew_microwave_auditory_effect_also_known_as/</a></p>

<p>Since you are in the process of being diagnosed, I recommend asking an orthomolecular psychiatrist, holistic physician or a naturopath to order neurotransmitter tests, amino acid tests and vitamin and mineral tests. This will determine whether you have the biochemistry for paranoia, schizophrenia or obsessive compulsive disorder.</p>

<p>[WIKI] Mental Health: TIs attacked by DEWs do not have the biochemistry of mental illness</p>

<p>I encourage TIs to submit written meter reports. NonTIs do not have to blindly believe microwave auditory effect exists. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Attention <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>! OP posted what the gangstalking movement considers to be &quot;paid protesting&quot; or a &quot;disinformation&quot; website as the first link. While targeted individuals and gangstalking is a serious problem, this may not be the best start.</p>

<p><strong>Check out <a href="http://stopgangstalking.org">stopgangstalking.org</a> instead</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>This month, <a href="/u/DaMagiciansBack">/u/DaMagiciansBack</a> became a mod of <a href="/r/gangstalking">/r/gangstalking</a>. His alt account, <a href="/u/stopgangstalking">/u/stopgangstalking</a>, was a mod of <a href="/r/gangstalking">/r/gangstalking</a> in 2015. <a href="/u/pogomaster12">/u/pogomaster12</a> demodded him and banned him. </p>

<p>I am glad <a href="/u/daryatash">/u/daryatash</a> acted on my recommendation to crosspost in TI subs so other TIs can comment in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>.
<a href="/u/DaMagiciansBack">/u/DaMagiciansBack</a> considers biggerthansnowden.com a disinformation site. <a href="/u/daryatash">/u/daryatash</a> failed to ask why and refused to remove the reference.<a href="/u/DaMagiciansBack">/u/DaMagiciansBack</a> tagged the crosspost in <a href="/r/gangstalking">/r/gangstalking</a> as disinformation based on the references list in the post. I PM <a href="/u/DaMagiciansBack">/u/DaMagiciansBack</a> recommending that he explain why in <a href="/r/gangstalking">/r/gangstalking</a>. He has tagged several posts as disinformation in <a href="/r/gangstalking">/r/gangstalking</a> without explaining why. The disinformation tag discourages subscribers from reading the posts. It makes nonTIs  wonder why disinformation has not been removed but not debated.</p>

<p>Because head mod <a href="/u/Tok-A-Mak">/u/Tok-A-Mak</a> is not a TI, after I was demoded, <a href="/r/gangstalking">/r/gangstalking</a> has had a lot of disinformation. I have debated much of the disinformation in <a href="/r/gangstalking">/r/gangstalking</a> in my subs. I always research, explain and cite sources why a post, blogsite, website or youtube video is disinformation.  For example, I had submitted a post several months ago on the lack of accuracy by biggerthansnowden. I emailed biggerthansnowen requesting correcitons. Biggerhtansnowden responded but refused to correct their website.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TargetedEnergyWeapons/comments/5jlsod/surveys_ffchs_rebuttals_biggerthansnowdencom/">https://www.reddit.com/r/TargetedEnergyWeapons/comments/5jlsod/surveys_ffchs_rebuttals_biggerthansnowdencom/</a></p>

<p><a href="/u/DaMagiciansBack">/u/DaMagiciansBack</a>, like his alt account <a href="/u/stopgangstalking">/u/stopgangstalking</a>, has a history of censorship. He instigated <a href="/u/Tok-A-Mak">/u/Tok-A-Mak</a> breach of agreement to refer my new sub <a href="/r/targetedenergyweapons">/r/targetedenergyweapons</a> in the sidebar of <a href="/r/gangstalking">/r/gangstalking</a>. <a href="/u/Tok-A-Mak">/u/Tok-A-Mak</a> recommended I create a new sub on the topics he decided to censor: directed energy weapons, ultrasound weapons, stasi, implants and surveys.</p>

<p><a href="/u/stopgangstalking">/u/stopgangstalking</a> also instigated removing the post I submitted announcing the creation of <a href="/r/targetedenergyweapons">/r/targetedenergyweapons</a> and a post on what topics <a href="/r/electromagnetics">/r/electromagnetics</a> covers. </p>
