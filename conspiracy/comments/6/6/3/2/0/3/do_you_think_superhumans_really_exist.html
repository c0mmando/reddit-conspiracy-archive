    <div class="md"><p>I believe there&#39;s some scientific validity to mind over matter in the limited sense. <em>which is what alot of popular &quot;superpowers&quot; are about, telekinesis etc.</em> (Think Wim Hoff as an off the cuff example)</p>

<p>I&#39;dd also argue due to the possible corruption in our sciences (which is conspiracy heavy, obviously), things percieved as magic or &quot;super powers&quot; <em>could</em> be possible.</p>

<p>Scenes from Marvel movies seem pretty far out there, yet if you add up the limited &quot;super powers&quot; we DO have (again Wim Hoff as an example) with the theories of our pineal gland, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_esotericism">illuminati esotericism</a> and alot of other conspiracy stuff, I&#39;dd argue anything is possible.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That would be Wim Hoff indeed. For me personally, the man represents emperical proof mind of matter does exist. He proves that by using his mind, he can, physically, control the state of his body. (Immune system and the likes)</p>

<p>From the recent CIA releases regarding remote viewing (like 2 months ago-ish?), I assume that there&#39;s some credibility to the matter. </p>

<p>Litteraly travelling through the the physical universe (and time) as a non-local entity (Read: not physical) seems to be more science than fiction.</p>

<p>Altough I admit the latter is perhaps taking a premature step, the precedent is there.</p>

Here&#39;s the study they did on a group of 20 people. 10 people were taught his techniques and meditated after they were injected and the other 10 did nothing. Can you guess which 10 got sick? :p </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s a fair viewpoint, I was just curious since you stated your view so matter-of-factly, I wanted to know your perspective on this. I find the CIA releases regarding remote viewing fascinating, but I&#39;m always open to the idea of such releases to be fabrications meant to call our reality into question, whereby seeding confusion and uncertainty. Still, I don&#39;t know either way, but they&#39;re intriguing.</p>

<p>James Randi is of course a legend, and I&#39;m well aware of his challenges. I have no doubt that most of those who claim to be psychic or energetic healers or clairvoyant are either delusional or deliberate con-artists, but I&#39;ve also experienced things in my own life that in turn lend credibility to such abilities existing in some form or another. None of it conclusive in terms of evidence, but rather convincing in terms of personal experience. An old lady I know who seems to be able to kickstart and guide the body&#39;s own self-healing abilities via placing her hands over affected areas in the body, as just one example, has produced remarkable results, not only in myself but in countless other patients. She usually doesn&#39;t even take any money for what she does, making her case especially intriguing. My most reasonable explanation, of course, revolves around the Placebo effect, but if that&#39;s all that there is to it, it would be remarkable in and of itself.</p>

Most humans born are only capable of using some 25% of their brain capacity on average (please correct me if I&#39;m wrong). But that is an average. Out of 7 billion people there has to be at least 1 who is born with a mutation that allows say 30% of the brain to be used for cognitive function, or maybe even more. Even a 5% bump in brain activity will definitely give someone a huge advantage over others. Imo these people SHOULD reproduce, but I can guarantee there exist people who would say otherwise just out of greed.</p>

<p>I would like to correct you, then. The whole &quot;humans only use X% of their brain&quot; thing is a myth. It&#39;s simply not true, never has been. The myth has been around for a long time, we&#39;re not quite sure where it got started, but we <em>are</em> sure that <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/do-people-only-use-10-percent-of-their-brains/">it&#39;s complete and utter bunk</a>. </p>

<p>A quote:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;It turns out though, that we use virtually every part of the brain, and that [most of] the brain is active almost all the time,&quot; Gordon adds. &quot;Let&#39;s put it this way: the brain represents three percent of the body&#39;s weight and uses 20 percent of the body&#39;s energy.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think some of this has to do with the consciousness and the suppresion of research of it. I try to look at it this way:</p>

<ul>
<li>Atoms are energy</li>
<li>Atoms  form extremely conplex cellular systems, to create organs, tissue, fluids, etc that ultimately comprise the human</li>
<li>Therefore humans are energy</li>
</ul>

<p>It seems to me that no Government Organization wants to investigate the cultivation of this energy, and we have been lead to believe that something that can&#39;t be reproduced in a lab using the scientific method just doesn&#39;t exist. So there is some form of suppression in regard to investigating the human energy and it&#39;s applications. Some of which could be levitation, telekinesis, mind reading, etc. Sounds something out of a comic book, but what if comic books took this knowledge from reality, out of luck...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>None of those channels provide compelling evidence of telekinesis. Anyone could produce those effects from home. Knocking over a flimsy piece of foil or a playing card? Uri Geller was doing those tricks decades ago, and he was busted for simply using his breath to knock over / spin small objects. </p>

<p>Opening a door with your mind? How about a camera on the other side of the door to demonstrate there isn&#39;t a 3rd party doing the hard work...? Isn&#39;t it curious that in each of the videos, there is a way to replicate their footage by using trickery? You&#39;d think they&#39;d just go to a field nearby and toss a chair around the field using just their mind. They would get so many views and get to go on every talk show!</p>

<p>Sure those videos won&#39;t provide scientific evidence of the reality of the phenomenon, but that DOES NOT mean the phenomenon isn&#39;t real.  When you examine the totality of evidence, you will come to a surprising conclusion.</p>

<p>Uri gellar was legit... sure he was kinda scummy and made money from it, but it doesn&#39;t take away the reality of the phenomenon.... Netanyahu,Meir, Carter and the CIA know he&#39;s legit.</p>

<p>There is proof and certain people know for a fact.... wikileaks will give a hint which publicly traded companies know...</p>

<p>The simple fact of the matter is that consciousness generates matter, matter doesn&#39;t generate consciousness.</p>

<p>It all makes sense as Eben Alexander of Harvard says.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Tangentially related, Thought experiment.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve played with the idea, with some anecdotal positive  results, that if I can have a thought quickly enough without putting it  into actual thought/words that I get both input and output from things that are soon to happen and can prevent things that threaten.  </p>

<p>Just as a random  example, one case was that I &#39;inexplicably&#39;  slowed down to about 20 MPH going into a curve and would have otherwise met a  dump truck  that was coming around  towards me on the wrong side of the road. </p>

<p>There are a stack of such things but you wouldn&#39;t believe me anyway. Just try quickly and lightly without stressing, thinking  what you&#39;d like to happen and resist  mentally putting the thought into words. Then dismiss the thought and wait to see if you get a result. Such wordless images seem to have power that dissipates once the thought is expressed,  even silently as words.</p>

<p>Ooh voodoo, hocus pokus, I know.</p>
