       Isn't there also the often (re)posted pdf-documents from CIA/US governments own websites detailing their studies on telepathic people and the thing that's always highlighted is how they (CIA) just seem to accept it as "real". As if it's an open secret.

       The CIA would use psychics to focus on and describe a time and location inside a sealed envelope. They tried to trick a psychic by making the location Mars and the time a Million years ago. This is the result.

       The Mars coordinates the CIA psychic was asked to focus on (in the newly declassified reports) are less than 10km away from "The Face on Mars", and Google Mars has a strange chatbot there.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Mars coordinates the psychic is first asked to focus on are 40.89 degrees north, 9.55 degrees west.

       I believe there's some scientific validity to mind over matter in the limited sense.
       <em>
        which is what alot of popular "superpowers" are about, telekinesis etc.
       </em>
       (Think Wim Hoff as an off the cuff example)
      </p>
      <p>
       I'dd also argue due to the possible corruption in our sciences (which is conspiracy heavy, obviously), things percieved as magic or "super powers"
       <em>
        could
       </em>
       be possible.
      </p>
      <p>
       Scenes from Marvel movies seem pretty far out there, yet if you add up the limited "super powers" we DO have (again Wim Hoff as an example) with the theories of our pineal gland,
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_esotericism">
        illuminati esotericism
       </a>
       and alot of other conspiracy stuff, I'dd argue anything is possible.

       That would be Wim Hoff indeed. For me personally, the man represents emperical proof mind of matter does exist. He proves that by using his mind, he can, physically, control the state of his body. (Immune system and the likes)
      </p>
      <p>
       From the recent CIA releases regarding remote viewing (like 2 months ago-ish?), I assume that there's some credibility to the matter.
      </p>
      <p>
       Litteraly travelling through the the physical universe (and time) as a non-local entity (Read: not physical) seems to be more science than fiction.
      </p>
      <p>
       Altough I admit the latter is perhaps taking a premature step, the precedent is there.

       I sometimes do the breathing exercise (30 breaths in and out, then hold your breath as long as you controllably can), and I've gone over 2 minutes in holding my breath at times. Would love to get to 3 minutes to see what potential really unlocks for me.

       I've recently been watching videos of wim hof and came across one where doctors in Europe (can't remember which country or hospital) injected him with a bacteria that usually makes people sick for 3 hours or so and he was able to fight it off by meditating.   Here's the study they did on a group of 20 people. 10 people were taught his techniques and meditated after they were injected and the other 10 did nothing. Can you guess which 10 got sick? :p

       That's incredible..we probably have so much untapped potential that we activate through mental techniques.

       Lol if Doctor's never heard of Wim hof and you told them that you can go into freezing temperatures indefinitely and keep your body temperature the EXACT same simply from using your mind...they would call you crazy.

       The CIA would use psychics to focus on and describe a time and location inside a sealed envelope. They tried to trick a psychic by making the location Mars and the time a Million years ago. This is the result.

       The Mars coordinates the CIA psychic was asked to focus on (in the newly declassified reports) are less than 10km away from "The Face on Mars", and Google Mars has a strange chatbot there.

       That's a fair viewpoint, I was just curious since you stated your view so matter-of-factly, I wanted to know your perspective on this. I find the CIA releases regarding remote viewing fascinating, but I'm always open to the idea of such releases to be fabrications meant to call our reality into question, whereby seeding confusion and uncertainty. Still, I don't know either way, but they're intriguing.

       James Randi is of course a legend, and I'm well aware of his challenges. I have no doubt that most of those who claim to be psychic or energetic healers or clairvoyant are either delusional or deliberate con-artists, but I've also experienced things in my own life that in turn lend credibility to such abilities existing in some form or another. None of it conclusive in terms of evidence, but rather convincing in terms of personal experience. An old lady I know who seems to be able to kickstart and guide the body's own self-healing abilities via placing her hands over affected areas in the body, as just one example, has produced remarkable results, not only in myself but in countless other patients. She usually doesn't even take any money for what she does, making her case especially intriguing. My most reasonable explanation, of course, revolves around the Placebo effect, but if that's all that there is to it, it would be remarkable in and of itself.

       The CIA would use psychics to focus on and describe a time and location inside a sealed envelope. They tried to trick a psychic by making the location Mars and the time a Million years ago. This is the result.

       I think extraordinary people definitely do exist, but likely not to the extent of X-Men or other superheroes. Most humans born are only capable of using some 25% of their brain capacity on average (please correct me if I'm wrong). But that is an average. Out of 7 billion people there has to be at least 1 who is born with a mutation that allows say 30% of the brain to be used for cognitive function, or maybe even more. Even a 5% bump in brain activity will definitely give someone a huge advantage over others. Imo these people SHOULD reproduce, but I can guarantee there exist people who would say otherwise just out of greed.

       I would like to correct you, then. The whole "humans only use X% of their brain" thing is a myth. It's simply not true, never has been. The myth has been around for a long time, we're not quite sure where it got started, but we
       <em>
        are
       </em>
       sure that
       <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/do-people-only-use-10-percent-of-their-brains/">
        it's complete and utter bunk

        "It turns out though, that we use virtually every part of the brain, and that [most of] the brain is active almost all the time," Gordon adds. "Let's put it this way: the brain represents three percent of the body's weight and uses 20 percent of the body's energy."

       I think some of this has to do with the consciousness and the suppresion of research of it. I try to look at it this way:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Atoms are energy
       </li>
       <li>
        Atoms  form extremely conplex cellular systems, to create organs, tissue, fluids, etc that ultimately comprise the human
       </li>
       <li>
        Therefore humans are energy
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       It seems to me that no Government Organization wants to investigate the cultivation of this energy, and we have been lead to believe that something that can't be reproduced in a lab using the scientific method just doesn't exist. So there is some form of suppression in regard to investigating the human energy and it's applications. Some of which could be levitation, telekinesis, mind reading, etc. Sounds something out of a comic book, but what if comic books took this knowledge from reality, out of luck...

       Don't you think if levitation and telekinesis were real, somebody would upload and spread video demonstrations of them. People are very curious about supernatural abilities and the news would spread quick. No amount of government censorship could successfully "erase" all instances of said videos.

       I am not saying the government is deleting video proof that humans can levitate or use telekinesis, i am saying throughout history governments have suppressed information, they have suppressed knowledge, that in this case could allow us to reach our maximum potential, could let us do stuff with the power of our minds.

       Treborseven, Sean McNamara, and reality files are 3 youtube channels of guys using their telekinetic abilities.
      </p>
      <p>
       See the problem with so much of the naysayers is they simply haven't done the research, oftentimes they call out "why hasn't this been done and video proof??" But in reality it has and people just ignore the evidence
      </p>
      <p>
       People find it much easier to dismiss evidence that challenges their worldview than accept it and redefine their ontological perspective.

       None of those channels provide compelling evidence of telekinesis. Anyone could produce those effects from home. Knocking over a flimsy piece of foil or a playing card? Uri Geller was doing those tricks decades ago, and he was busted for simply using his breath to knock over / spin small objects.
      </p>
      <p>
       Opening a door with your mind? How about a camera on the other side of the door to demonstrate there isn't a 3rd party doing the hard work...? Isn't it curious that in each of the videos, there is a way to replicate their footage by using trickery? You'd think they'd just go to a field nearby and toss a chair around the field using just their mind. They would get so many views and get to go on every talk show!

       You asked "but if it's real, wouldn't people upload videos?" Yes people upload videos, and people like you immediately dismiss themwithout looking at the larger picture.  See, you already have your believe system set without looking at the evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sure those videos won't provide scientific evidence of the reality of the phenomenon, but that DOES NOT mean the phenomenon isn't real.  When you examine the totality of evidence, you will come to a surprising conclusion.

       Uri gellar was legit... sure he was kinda scummy and made money from it, but it doesn't take away the reality of the phenomenon.... Netanyahu,Meir, Carter and the CIA know he's legit.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is proof and certain people know for a fact.... wikileaks will give a hint which publicly traded companies know...
      </p>
      <p>
       The simple fact of the matter is that consciousness generates matter, matter doesn't generate consciousness.
      </p>
      <p>
       It all makes sense as Eben Alexander of Harvard says.
      </p>
      <p>
       You have a lot to learn buddy, maybe you should start with Annie Jacobsens phenomena, then read the books of the operators who were stationed at ft. Meade.

       The CIA would use psychics to focus on and describe a time and location inside a sealed envelope. They tried to trick a psychic by making the location Mars and the time a Million years ago. This is the result.

       The Mars coordinates the CIA psychic was asked to focus on (in the newly declassified reports) are less than 10km away from "The Face on Mars", and Google Mars has a strange chatbot there.

       The Mars coordinates the psychic is first asked to focus on are 40.89 degrees north, 9.55 degrees west.

       Tangentially related, Thought experiment.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've played with the idea, with some anecdotal positive  results, that if I can have a thought quickly enough without putting it  into actual thought/words that I get both input and output from things that are soon to happen and can prevent things that threaten.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just as a random  example, one case was that I 'inexplicably'  slowed down to about 20 MPH going into a curve and would have otherwise met a  dump truck  that was coming around  towards me on the wrong side of the road.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are a stack of such things but you wouldn't believe me anyway. Just try quickly and lightly without stressing, thinking  what you'd like to happen and resist  mentally putting the thought into words. Then dismiss the thought and wait to see if you get a result. Such wordless images seem to have power that dissipates once the thought is expressed,  even silently as words.

       The Mars coordinates the psychic is first asked to focus on are 40.89 degrees north, 9.55 degrees west.
