       I'll admit that I'm not an expert on a lot of these conspiracies. That being said, I do agree there is compelling evidence that the elite wants to depopulate the planet. Or at the very least their actions are very reckless. Either by starting a world war, estrogen-laced processed foods, increasing abortions, or lowering birthrates (China's one child policy). Gun control is an obvious ploy to leave us all defenseless and easier to kill off. Autonomous killer robots are very worrying and could be part of this scheme. I've also heard theories that there has been a cure for cancer for years but "they" are hiding it from us.
      </p>
      <p>
       But if depopulation is indeed the goal, then why have the Powers That Be tried so hard to stop everybody from doing the one thing that is the leading cause of preventable death? That is, smoking? If the lower classes are the Elite's opponents, then why do they care if we smoke or not? "Never interrupt your opponent when he's doing himself in" as the old saying goes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Shouldn't they be encouraging people to smoke and slowly kill themselves? We should see cigarette ads in every commercial break, tobacco sponsorship of the Superbowl, and smoking should still be allowed everywhere from restaurants and bars to daycares and hospitals. They should be handing out cigarettes in school, because we already know that the elite have no problem with dead children (just look at drone strikes).
      </p>
      <p>
       Yet the noose is tightening so hard on smoking that you're hard pressed to find cigarettes for less than $5 a pack, you can hardly smoke anywhere anymore, and some countries like Australia don't even allow tobacco companies to put their own logos on their own products anymore (plain packaging). But I thought that Australia/New Zealand was where all the elites plan to flee to once the SHTF.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't get it. Are the elites stupid? Why are they deliberately sabotaging their own goal of killing everyone off? Maybe you could argue that smoking isn't part of their master plan. Or maybe the elite groups pushing for tobacco control are different from the elite groups pushing depopulation. But then why haven't we seen the Tobacco Control group and the Depopulation group in open political conflict with each other?

       Are you kidding?  Smoking is projected to kill 200 million people over the next century in China alone.  The fact that it is still legal anywhere in the world is completely mindblowing, not to mention it spawned the PR industry playbook that is now used to defend fracking, questions on vaccine safety, genetically modified food, and more.

       But if the elites want depopulation, why wouldn't they want us all to smoke and kill ourselves? The elites make the laws, look at the corporatism in this country.
      </p>

       Either the elites don't want depopulation, or they don't actually make the laws.

       It's still legal worldwide and tobacco companies are among the more powerful multinationals in the world.  The facts do not agree with your hypothesis.

       Okay, the fact that it's still legal doesn't answer my question of why there is increasing regulation on it. Particularly in the West which is the main target of depopulation. If they truly want to kill us all off, then regulations on cigarettes should either remain static or they should be repealed. The fact that the noose is
       <em>
        tightening
       </em>
       on one of the biggest causes of death worldwide, doesn't agree with the argument that the elites want to kill off a huge portion of the population.

       I don't think you're following, despite the regulation smoking is projected to
       <em>
        kill more people annually going forward

       .  The regulation is a red herring probably designed to placate the public.

       That's the best theory that I've heard so far in these comments, but it still leaves a lot of questions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most state smoking bans have only passed by razor thin margins (55%-45% or so, and there are examples of local ones being voted down). In the 2016 elections, tobacco tax increases were actually voted down in both California and Colorado. This is in spite of only 17% or so of Americans smoking. A much bigger percentage of Americans are in favor of people being able to make their own choices, even if those choices are stupid and potentially deadly to the one making them.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think that you can say that a majority of the population wants the sort of tobacco control outlined in the UN Framework for Tobacco Control, which calls for huge taxes, smoking bans almost everywhere except for private homes, and plain packaging or packaging with disgusting warning labels on them. Most people dont' smoke and already know it's bad for you, so why would they want to look at grotesque imagery in anti-smoking commercials on TV, or on cigarette packs themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       So I don't know how an issue which is far from a majority opinion, that of tobacco control, is being pushed by the elites to "placate" people. If anything maybe it's a wedge issue they're using to further divide us, and turn neighbor against neighbor? The same way they've tried to divide the races and genders on political lines, are they doing the same thing with smokers vs. nonsmokers?

       I think some of the bans are to avoid state liability, nothing more, and to give the appearance that 'regulators are making progress' when in reality smoking is still legal and vaping has taken off in popularity despite evidence that the liquids used can be just as carcinogenic.  The reality is that nothing has really changed, if anything they've made public 'smoking' and nicotine dependence even more accessible with the vaping phenomenon, under the guise that it's somehow healthier.

       Chemical analysis of most of the e-liquid reveal very low or nonexistent traces of carcinogens. Most of the bad stuff that does exist, comes from China and it's because vaping is still a new and unregulated industry. A lot of doctors have recommended that people switch from smoking to vaping. I have yet to see a single study that vaping is just as bad as smoking, or even unhealthy.
      </p>
      <p>
       But even if none of the scientific evidence is to be trusted, people who have switched from smoking to vaping have reported that they no longer get winded walking up stairs, they no longer cough up phlegm, etc. I think that anecdotal evidence is powerful that even if vaping is unhealthy, it's certainly not as unhealthy as smoking.
      </p>
      <p>
       I vape myself. I vape in my car all the time. There isn't any discolored residue on the windows. I used to smoke, and I smoked in my car, and there was all sorts of yellow crap on the windows and dashboard that I'd have to clean off. Which would you rather inhale? The stuff that leaves no residue on walls, or the stuff that leaves gross yellow tar everywhere? Which is probably more healthy?

       Maybe slowly over decades, people have begun to realize the dangers of smoking cigarettes and have worked against TPTB to put forth legislation to limit the power of the tobacco industry for the benefit of the population.

       So does that mean that there's hope for us to fight them in other ways? I.E. the ones that I mentioned? Perhaps TPTB are not as powerful as some in this sub are led to believe?

       The people can and do make change. Look at how far we've come with labor laws, work safety regulations, food safety regulations, medications (relatively speaking of course, though they largely treat symptoms, not underlying conditions). So much of what we encounter daily has a warning label of some kind, and most of the time you can thank the public for those regulations.
      </p>
      <p>
       It takes so long to accomplish, and organization is difficult when more than one issue comes into play, but change can most definitely be made.

       Do you believe that the Elite have the ability to release phony scientific studies? If that is the case, why haven't we seen more studies sponsored by the elite that conclude that smoking isn't actually harmful, or that it's less harmful than most people think, etc. They don't seem to be fighting tobacco control at all, even though they really should be if they indeed want to depopulate the planet.

       They want to depopulate, but they only want to kill off the people who can't serve as a cog in the system. (i.e. - homeless, starving africans, illnesses etc.

       Then why has New York raised cigarette taxes to be so high that middle class people can't even afford them, let alone homeless people. $10 a pack isn't going to kill many homeless people. If the elite really wanted to kill off the homeless, we should see cigarette vending machines on every streetcorner with $0.50 a pack smokes.

       Money dude. It's about money. You have to think about alot of other things like healthcare or taxes or other things. 
They don't give a fuck if you kill yourself. They do care about the taxes that could be raised up because its so bad. They do care about all the money going to healthcare because of smokers. That money could go into their pockets instead. 
You need to look at the big picture.

       The VA costs a lot of money, too. So does obesity. Yet we see endless wars leading to disabled vets, and we see and commercials for every fatty, unhelthy garbage that you can think of. In fact, it's cheaper to eat like a pig than it is to eat organic. I think that if lowering healthcare costs were the elites' concern, they should be going after a lot more than just cigarettes.

       I don't think you're following, despite the regulation smoking is projected to
       <em>
        kill more people annually going forward
       </em>
       .  The regulation is a red herring probably designed to placate the public.
