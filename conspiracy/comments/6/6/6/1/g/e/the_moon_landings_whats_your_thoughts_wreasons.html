       We've landed on the moon, but the footage is fake. The Secret Space Program has a fleet of space ships that can easily cross the solar system. We already have bases on Mars. And aliens exist.

       What I think is that the size of the conspiracy required for the space program to be a fake is absurd. Tens of thousands of scientists, engineers, pilots and regular old technicians would have to be in on it. Not only that, but they would have to have
       <em>
        been
       </em>
       in on it often since college.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only way they wouldn't have to be in this is if the tools they use to do their jobs were not only faked, but faked with technology far beyond anything we think we possess even today.
      </p>
      <p>
       So the real question you are asking is not "Are the moon landings real", but "Do we live in a world that is secretly controlled by very advanced technology that can make people think they see things they don't see?"
      </p>
      <p>
       My answer to that question is ... I don't think so, but I guess I wouldn't be able to tell anyway.

       NASA is notorious for compartmentalizing, so only a few people would have access to the big picture --

       You should watch the 1977 film
       <em>
        Capricorn One.
       </em>
       Gives a good outline for how the missions were compartmentalized so that the left hand knew not what the right hand was doing. People in the Houston control room were running yet another simulation they had run a thousand times but thinking they were doing it for real this time.  I'm sure some of them caught on, but you'll find that numerous mysterious deaths surround the Apollo program most notably the obviously murdered crew of Apollo 1.

       Good point. If we went once we would have gone back many times and it would have been insanely profitable, it's so beyond laughably stupid when people try to say there's no reason to go back to the moon, let alone the fact that NASA disagrees with this.

       But you don't have to take my word for it, many times NASA and other space agencies have expressed a desire to "return" to the moon and outlined why it is important. Russia even plans to go by 2030.

       Okay, so we like going places and exploring new things. That's fine. It still requires a point.  Exploring of the sake of it is fine, but if that exploration is difficult and expensive with no real goal in mind beyond saying "okay we did it" I'm not really sure you have much of an argument.

       And so space agencies have
       <em>

       said they want to go back. Right, so now that they might have new goals in mind they've rekindled their desire.

       The point is if anyone could go back, they would. Any country would love to be the second nation on the moon for many reasons that should be obvious. The idea that the Apollo missions prepared from scratch in the course of about 7-8 years to fly 6 successful moon missions and no one can go after the ensuing 47 years is flat out unbelievable.

       I'm not sure what's prestigious about being "second on the moon". The whole point of the moon is to show off, you did it first. Their goal was to "go to the moon". They achieved their goal. They managed to flex their science and military might at a time in international politics where that was very important.

       We've already talked about how Alan Bean proved with his egregious faux pas that they didn't go. Now you're just speculating and making ludicrous assertions that contradict what spokespeople of nations and space agencies including NASA say about wanting to go to the moon. In other words, grasping at straws. Your statement about "their goal" is also fallacious since the NASA astronauts allegedly made five return trips after the first one when they had already achieved that goal, allegedly performing various experiments during that time.

       You're saying there's no reason to go back to the moon when precisely the opposite was asserted by NASA and plenty of other "science authorities." This is speculation on your part since you're not citing anyone who you are speaking for.
      </p>
      <p>
       His slip-up proves Apollo 12 was a fraud, as I've already explained and as the video itself clearly explains, because there is no possible way that anyone who traveled to the moon would not be able to cogently answer that question about the Van Allen radiation belts, which are a whole different subject that can be brought up to debunk the moon hoaxes.

       When did I say there isn't interest in going back to the moon? I'm not sure why you're so upset.
      </p>
      <p>
       Something can happen at one point in time, and then again at another. Just because it doesn't happen at points in between those times doesn't make it a hoax.
      </p>
      <p>
       Moon missions stopped being priority, and then stopped altogether.  Just so happens they've started to generate some interest again.
      </p>
      <p>
       How does his slip up prove Apollo 12 was a fraud? You haven't gone in to depth on that. Was Alan Bean a mission planner? No. Is he even a scientist? No.

       Not upset at all. Even if you maintain that moon missions weren't a priority for the United States, it doesn't explain why no other industrialized nation has been since then, especially considering the Soviet Union was clearly beating us in the space race at the time, yet we are to believe they just gave up after we made it there in 1969. As if they just said "oh well screw it, scrap the whole program."  It's just a silly concept but one that is required if you want to continue believing in the Apollo missions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Alan Bean was in fact competent in science enough to get an aeronautical science degree as well as two honorary doctorates of science, one in engineering. Any man on a moon mission would be well aware of the locations and dangers of the Van Allen belts since they would represent about 25,000 miles worth of the journey and be fraught with peril. The fact that his answer turns into a sputtering mess proves he is lying, which proves Apollo 12 was illegitimate, which proves the entire Apollo program to be a hoax. You cannot seriously think that any astronaut going to the moon, especially in a crew of only three people, would be blissfully unaware of the Van Allen belts, which have been known of since 1958 and which to this day NASA hilariously  still regards as a principle obstacle to manned space missions.

       What needs to be explained?
      </p>
      <p>
       There was no reason, no need and no ability to go. Why would Canada or Englan ever want to go to the moon?
      </p>
      <p>
       The USSR was not beating the US in the space race. That's why the US got to the moon first to wave their dick around on it. The USSR started pretty strong but really didn't have the gains that the final push of the US space program did.
      </p>
      <p>
       And yes. That's how it happened. In the late 1960s, the USSR started to decrease funding for its space program.  They were more interested in ICBM production and internal strife from a really poorly run program meant really putting in the dedication was difficult. Their program ended largely in failure. They then looked to retooling for orbital space station research and planning.
      </p>
      <p>
       They didn't say "scrap the whole thing" a series of operational, logistical and political failures meant it wasn't really something that could be easily pursued and their resources better spent elsewhere- the aforementioned ICBM and space station programs.
      </p>
      <p>
       America beat the USSR to the moon. There wasn't much worth in saying "hey we got there too....eventually"
      </p>
      <p>
       Okay, so Alan Bean got a bachelor in aeronautics engineering. Okay? What does that have to do with his mission planning? He was a pilot which is why he was hired.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why would any man be aware of these dangers if these "dangers" are irrelevant and most of the planning is done by NASA? At that point he wouldn't be zooming around dodging asteroids but following a specifically designed path using very precise mathematics.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Van Allen belts are not a single continuous region. The area they went through was not very dangerous. It wasn't a 25,000 mile quagmire.
      </p>
      <p>
       How  does his answer, where he indicates this isn't really a big deal, indicate he is lying or the trip was illegitimate? That's a pretty massive leap in logic and speaks to your paranoia more than anything. I'd suggest a better look at what the term "proves" means.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Apollo mission was crewed by three people. That's correct. However, they were backed up by a team of dozens. How many 747s are flown by 30 people?
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes, the Van Allen Belts have been known about since the 1950s. It's also known that the area they sailed through wasn't of much danger.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes, NASA regards it as an obstacle for future missions. That's correct. Just like gravity is an obstacle (and a very dangerous one) for any plane to overcome.

       Don't know what to tell you other than it's sad that you're spending this much time writing all these words with no substance. The above is just a bunch of assertions that are easily demonstrably wrong. The USSR in fact was "beating" us in the space race, accomplishing every other landmark before we did.... except making it to the moon, which still hasn't been replicated.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Why would Canada or Englan [sic] ever want to go to the moon" is such a terrible and obvious rhetorical question, it's comical how many answers there are.  Any nation would want to go to the moon for reasons we already discussed, reasons that are readily available that many nations have already outlined, and most importantly $$$.
      </p>
      <p>
       Saying the Van Allen belts are "not very dangerous" is basically the last thing Apollo believers have to cling to, the absurdity being that if they're not dangerous than why has no one else in human history ever been near them, other than the Apollo astronuts who went through them and then ten times farther.  James Van Allen, who discovered the belts, would entirely disagree and actually laugh at this statement, since it says right in his first paper than 10-100 Roentgen per hour in the belts meant that a technique for shielding must be found before humans went through this area of space. And as I already said but will now link to so you can see for yourself, many "authorities" including NASA have on multiple occasions admitted that this is an obstacle we still are trying to figure out:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oKWZGY3I-C0">
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oKWZGY3I-C0
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Alan Bean's blunder is absolutely damning; there's no possible way in hell that he would not know whether the astronauts went through the belts or not.... just stop with saying he's not a "planner." The belts were a huge obstacle and would have been (since they still are) a primary focus of the mission, one that each astronut would be
       <em>
        acutely
       </em>
       aware of. There are even more interviews with these astronuts where they say "we're not just pilots or passengers" and talk about how much they had to know about the missions, so again you make assertions out of seemingly thin air that are directly contradicted by real life evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       You are free to persist believing in the Apollo missions. If you don't want to even begin to think critically about them then the fairy tale is all yours to savor and enjoy until it finally expires. It's probably not worth responding to me again, since I've already said I'm not less than 100% sure we never went, unless you either have actual evidence you want to offer that we did go (rather than hilariously trying to contort out of the points I'm bringing up that shoot the hoax out of the saddle, in the predictable fashion that I've seen hundreds of times) or if you actually do want to exercise any critical thinking.

       No substance? All I've seen is you connecting these glaring leaps in logic and demonstrating that you've never actually bothered to investigate your claims (like that of the Van Allen belts or the history of the space race)
      </p>
      <p>
       No, the USSR was not beating the USA at the time of the moon landings, and hadn't been for a while- at least from the development of the Gemini program. The USSR's moon program was largely a failure and they were unable to keep pace with the USA in that regard.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think you understand what a
       <em>
        rhetorical
       </em>
       question is. Maybe a quick check and get back to me.
      </p>
      <p>
       Those countries both had no reason to and no ability to.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes. Very nice link saying why NASA is interested in
       <em>
        future
       </em>
       missions.  Of course that link has nothing to do with why no one has been back since 1972.  The two are entirely unrelated. Missions change, technology changes, goals change, public interest changes, design specifications change- and they change a lot over the course of 50 years.
      </p>
      <p>
       You still have yet to describe why NASA "need to" go back after 1972. I feel this is just you building a strawman.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Van Allen belts are a very large area, some of which is dangerous, some of it not so much. It's not a huge, continuous dome of uniform, extremely high-danger space. That's another failing of your assumption.
      </p>
      <p>
       No other humans "in history have been near them" because there's no need to be. What would be the reason?
      </p>
      <p>
       James Van Allen's first research on the
       <strong>
        Belts
       </strong>
       was in the late 1950s. Shortly thereafter research had already been produced discussing ways to deal with those belts.  Into the first half of the 1960s, they'd already found out that they could simply skirt the worst parts, and that by going fast enough and limited exposure, they'd run a relatively low risk.  Of course, no one claimed the moon landings weren't risky. Of course, Van Allen himself has gone on to say that such claims about transit through the area being impossible are themselves ludicrous.
      </p>
      <p>
       So yes, can you provide evidence than Alan Bean planned every aspect of the mission? (Van Allen actually assisted in planning part of the trajectory).
      </p>
      <p>
       Know why you can't?
      </p>
      <p>
       Because he didn't. His ignorance of one
       <em>
        tiny
       </em>
       aspect of the mission doesn't mean much.  They were never a "primary focus" of the mission, as they'd be hurtling through them at high speed and spending very little time near them. A literal wave on the ocean.

       Yeah I was right when I said it would be worth it not to respond. You're wrong about everything from the USSR beating the USA in the space race (yes, they were) to the Van Allen belts being a "*tiny aspect" of the missions to the meaning of the phrase strawman argument. I already demonstrated incontrovertibly, using the word of NASA themselves as evidence, how the Van Allen belts are still a major obstacle for human space travel.
      </p>
      <p>
       This shrugging off of the belts, dismissal of them as "not that dangerous" is the dumbest thing that Apollo deniers do. All of your assertions and yet no space program has been near them other than the Apollo missions. It's ludicrous on its face.
      </p>
      <p>
       All the rest of your points are insipid to the point of not being worth responding to (again). I already told you you are free to believe the fairy tale for as long as you like. You're not convincing me of anything or even presenting any real arguments other than baseless assertions.

       Actually, no. You just keep spouting this lie. With the development of the Gemini program, the USA had pulled in front, and then took off considerably while Russia suffered a number of setbacks.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's see a list of NASA firsts, other than "first man on the moon"
      </p>
      <p>
       First transmitted message from space.
First orbital rendezvous
      </p>
      <p>
       First orbital docking

      <p>
       First weather/communcations/geosynchronous/spy/imaging/ sattelite.
      </p>
      <p>
       First controlled spaceflight.
      </p>
      <p>
       first human to orbit the moon
      </p>
      <p>
       Etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       And yes, the Van Allen Belts were not really a big deal- you can look to the statements made by Van Allen himself after they'd researched them a bit. That's a weird lynchpin on your argument that you've
       <em>
        clearly
       </em>
       never actually read about. I suspect you just saw some edgy copypasta somewhere. You're free to read any of nasa's statements, those of the scientists involve, or those of the person they're named after- who was involved in some planning stages in navigating them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Them being an "obstacle" doesn't mean they are an impassable obstacle.
      </p>
      <p>
       Every day thousands of airplanes overcome the obstacle known as gravity, something that is as dangerous, if not more dangerous than the Van Allen Belts, for failure to navigate the obstacle known as "gravity" will result in complete and utter destruction.
      </p>
      <p>
       You'll need to also post a better explanation of why Alan Bean's "slip up" (which you haven't shown that's what it is) is proof that he's lying.
      </p>
      <p>
       What "hundreds of aspects"? Post three.
      </p>
      <p>
       Body language? So now you're not only an expert on space engineering (which it's clear you're not as you don't understand what the Van Allen belts are) but now you're also an expert on body language?
      </p>
      <p>
       That's quite the resume you claim to have.
      </p>
      <p>
       Are you aware many of these people were test pilots? They didn't wake up aboard a massive rocket full of fuel aimed at space, with no idea what they were getting into. Everything about space travel- let alone early experimental travel is risky. One relatively minor facet of the inherently dangerous journey doesn't mean it wasn't possible.
      </p>
      <p>
       Otherwise you'd start to tell me the hundreds of thousands people working dangerous jobs the world over are liars. Wouldn't doubt you making that claim at this point.
      </p>
      <p>
       You keep saying things like "other people haven't done it" with no reasoning as to
       <em>
        why
       </em>
       . Just because isn't good enough.
      </p>
      <p>
       No other agency has yet gone near the outer reaches of the Van Allen Belts.  Why would they? What would be the purpose?
      </p>
      <p>
       There isn't one. Not currently anyway, and there hasn't been one since the 1970s.
      </p>
      <p>
       Study radiation? Like you mean how Nasa and Van Allen themselves did when they further investigated the belts in the 1960s and found a rapid transit of the thinnest areas the best plan? Sort of like that? Like precisely what was done?

       So how does a Pilot's specific statement on one event mean it didn't happen? You're making the assumption he was in charge of every facet of mission planning, and not you know, a huge team of people.

       To not know that the missions went through the Van Allen radiation belts would be like Christopher Columbus not knowing if he encountered the Atlantic Ocean.  It's simply damning for the hoax.

       Trying to destroy the accomplishment of going to the moon is the same as trying to  destroy American pride.  There are plenty who want to do that and the moon landing is a good place to try. JFK wanted us to go to the moon in less than 10 years.  A budget was made and the people were hired to do the job. The job got done in less than 10 years.  Common core engineers won't be doing the same any time soon.

       I believe the Apollo missions were faked. I do, however, believe it is in the realm of possibility that people have been to the moon.

       I think the conspiracy that we didn't go is a psyop. I think on the one of the Apollo missions they ran into something that told them don't come back. Sometime after that they hired Kubrick to assist them, and kinda started pushing out the idea they were faked to the conspiracy communities. They infomed the Russians, who put an end to their own efforts.
      </p>
      <p>
       Somewhere along the way they started the secret space program, I think in the 80s with Reagan. Then, the conspiracy that had neen positioned but not really pushed that hard, was doubled down on. They really tried to cement the idea we never went to obfuscate their actual activities.
      </p>
      <p>
       What better way to cover a space program than to make everyone wonder if it happened at all?

“NASA’s focus now is on sending humans beyond low-Earth orbit to Mars… We are trying to develop the technologies to get there, it is actually a huge technological challenge. There are a couple of really big issues. For one thing – Radiation. Once you get outside the Earth’s magnetic field we are going to be exposing the astronauts to not just radiation coming from the Sun, but also to cosmic radiation. That's a higher dose than we think humans right now should really get.”
