       But... your ideals are already public, they're on reddit. I absolutely don't care if you defend your ideals in person or only under "anonymous status", the question is, do you think the powerful forces you guys are denouncing would let it happen if you were onto anything serious?

       The key thing is to not give a fuck. The only thing to fear is fear itself.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the "evil forces" interferring. Why would they? It's far easier to point at people with alternate views and say look at those weirdos than it would be to censor everything. If they started censoring it'd be the biggest tip off that conspiracy minded people are onto something.

       Typically the kind of answer I expected! But if the evil forces are powerful enough to involve thousands of journalists, civilians, politicians, without any speaking up, why are they not powerful enough to shutdown any potential breakthrough?
      </p>
      <p>
       Or worse, infiltrate you and spread false conspiracies. Crazy right? The most upvoted posts here could be made by a government shill in order to blurr the questions, you wouldn't know anything about it!

       You can't spread a false conspiracy. You are confusing people who believe what they are told with people who research and come to their own conclusions. Blindly following a conspiracy without researching it yourself is just as bad as reading a newspaper and thinking you are an expert on a subject.
      </p>
      <p>
       If some shill comes along and says Tupac is alive and is about to negotiate peace with North Korea and it got 1000 upvotes I'd call bullshit the same way I call bullshit on the media narrative on the Syrian gas incident.
      </p>
      <p>
       Secondly you are niave about how many people it takes to cover things up. Just because someone does something doesn't mean they fully know why they did it. Do you think the hidden hand just walk up to a newspaper and say "Hi we're the evil forces. Please print this story in the paper". They use compartmentalisation and it is very effective at getting large amounts of people to do things without knowing the true purpose of their actions or how said actions fit in to the bigger picture.
      </p>
      <p>
       Finally the "breakthrough" won't come on here. The breakthrough will be when the people who know about the banking scam and how our entire system is designed to benefit the few reach critical mass if/once that happens and the existing power system is removed the truth will come out about everything.
      </p>
      <p>
       We might be right or wrong in here but the part we play is just to make people think for themselves and not to believe everything they are told.

       Being onto something serious means it is being discussed thoroughly by at least a handful of people. The info would spread too fast.
      </p>
      <p>
       They can't try to go kill every single person who now knows the information.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe if it was one due who was keeping the info all to himself but they suspected he knew some shit. Then yeah they'd probably off him.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't possess anything unique that shows I'm onto anything. But if I ever did I would handle it in the safest way possible.

       So they are capable of creating conspiracies that involve several thousands (millions?) of civilians, journalists, foreign sovereign governments without anyone publicly speaking up or providing evidence, but they can't go after a few folks on reddit?

       I for one do not believe they are capable of creating massive conspiracies (measured in numbers). All they need are a few powerful conspirators and thousands, or millions, of fools who are easily manipulated and ask few questions.

       Of course they can. I gave you 2 different scenarios though.
      </p>
      <p>
       One is a redditor who they can kill and shut up for good. The other example would be them killing all 1000 redditors from across the world who recently discovered some insane shit.

      <p>
       They are capable of trying to kill all those people but once it spread in the internet it is already out in the open.

       No one is under the radar anyway. All of our comms devices collect data. That data is stored forever. As computers get faster people will be able to extract more and more information from this ever increasing store of data.
      </p>
      <p>
       Eventually it will a matter of someone pressing f5 on a keyboard and seeing probabilities of everything about you.
      </p>
      <p>
       Think about your deepest secrets. It is a matter of time before a computer can say things like "88% chance that u/MonsieurCoty is a closet [homo/racist/murderer/republican/jewelthief/etc/etc/etc].
      </p>
      <p>
       So basically its not that I don't worry that 'they' will find out about me. It's more that I figure 'they' will find out about me anyway, and if I'm eventually going to be punished as a political dissident then I want to at least make it true first.

       But they don't even have to collect the dangerous data that you guys are digging into, it's right here on reddit! You're not hiding anything! So the question is, if anyone big was trying to hide things, why would they let r/conspiracy do it's thing without taking actions?
I do agree on the issue of personnal data collecting, it's basically the business that keeps internet running tho but hopefully I don't have anything to hide, I'm into regular porn and the most illegal thing i've ever done is smoking the ganj!

       Oh, I think I understand. You are saying "IF this stuff is so secret, then why would they let you post it here?"
      </p>
      <p>
       Nothing we post is really secret, and the establishment doesn't need to punish people for 'exposing' them. The public is blind. It doesn't matter what anyone posts.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here is an example. Before the US invaded Iraq, the international organization who's job it was to confirm the destruction of WMDs said "There are no WMDs in Iraq." Dozens of experts, many of them sent there by the US government reached the same conclusions.
      </p>
      <p>
       And yet we invaded anyway. After the fact, when the charade had to end and we admitted the WMDs weren't there the story changed to "We
       <em>
        all
       </em>
       thought they were there, we were just wrong." It's a pretty simple matter to go look at newspapers from 2001 to 2003 and see that we DID NOT all think the WMDs were there.
      </p>
      <p>
       But no one is going to do that. Because, for the average citizen, accepting the fact that we knew - really beyond a doubt - that there were no WMDs means accepting that the government is a scam. Almost the entire senate agreed to attacking Iraq - both parties. They can read. They knew there were no WMDs. But they did it anyway.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, I know this is long winded, but my point is that there is no proof that will convince people of something they truly don't want to believe. Adults don't want to believe they live in a fully controlled Orwellian nightmare because if they do then they won't be able to look their kids in the eye.
      </p>
      <p>
       So we pose no danger. They can point at us and say, "Look how crazy THEY ARE." and everything will continue until we are all dead.

       Right, but Americans -- both liberal and conservative -- don't seem to remember that we knew the info was fake when they said it. Because if they did then how could they now vote for Hillary Clinton? She knew it was fake. She voted for the invasion. Same with all the rest except Sanders.

       So what does this lead us to? Voters aren't rationnal? Woopdeedoo big discovery! Sociologists have been saying this for half a century. Voters mostly don't care of political issues, they just vote along with their peers/families/socio-economic classes. Pretty sure no one was thinking about Iraq when they went to vote in 2016!

       Sure, it's not news. But the point is that exposing conspiracies - like to the one to invade Iraq - has no real effect because when you ask someone to believe in a conspiracy you are also asking them to recognize that they have been duped.

       Dude, it's very commonly known that bush faked the proofs he needed to invade Irak, just ask someone outside of america. I was just saying voters are either non-rationnal, either base their vote on a bunch of fiscal, social and societal issues, not on whether or not their candidate voted a war 13 years prior. I'm not the one saying this, "voting sociologists"(the wording is probably wrong no ida how to translate this) are.

       We aren't disagreeing. We are misunderstanding each other. Perhaps I can give a better example.
      </p>
      <p>
       It seems impossible that the WTC was destroyed by two airplanes. Certainly people have laid out an amazing case to show this. Certainly the official investigation has been publicly debunked. Certainly everyone has heard someone say this to them, as well as giving them links to articles showing the details.
      </p>
      <p>
       And yet, most people think it is impossible that 9/11 could have been an inside job. It is considered a fringe theory.
      </p>
      <p>
       So why would anyone in power need to worry about being exposed on an internet forum? They are protected by the human defense mechanism that makes people choose to disbelieve facts that are right in front of them if believing those facts makes them recognize they are in peril.
      </p>
      <p>
       If this doesn't get my point across then perhaps I am misunderstanding your original post. You are asking us, "If this is true then why are you allowed to post it?" right?
      </p>
      <p>
       I guess the short answer is "because no one believes us."

       But they could PM others, create new accounts, go on different websites, spam posts until one makes it through, post from PC bangs and the list goes on. So many options to go through, why are the meaningful contents still censored if some free thinkers are eager to make everything known! And why even hang on reddit if anything meaningful is censored?

       Anyway, you seem to think that"anything meaningful" = "everything meaningful" and that's not true. There's degrees to which things matter. There's plenty of meaningful stuff here, just don't expect you'll reach the "highest plateau" the "final boss," however you want to describe it.

       Fellow lurker here
I appreciate your premise and have thought the same thing myself.
I'd like to present an alternative narrative from what's being presented here
It's frankly my belief that if we are talking and/or discussing information regarding the "evil forces" it is information to trivial to threaten those same forces. I personally take it further in the belief that the information we do know or are able to find out is kept that way deliberately to provide a complete narrative for the populace to sink their teeth into and thereby keep them invested in the progression of that narrative.
As an example I'll bring up MK Ultra where most of the files were destroyed and 6 percent of the program was so sensitive it was never documented at all. The accepted narrative is that those files that were preserved we're due to "clerical errors" which is certainly possible. I think it's equally possible they gave us just enough information to see the boogey man but not nearly enough to see is face.
      </p>
      <p>
       In short nothing we expose has the ability to threaten their narrative and our intellectual dissidence is actually an integral part in it

       What i mean't by lurker is that I don't endorse most of what i read here, i'm just in for the entertainment. At this point it's just whatever, just sprinkle some layers of conspiracies on top of your conspiracy to make it more believable, not really my problem! To give you some matter to think about, try to identify the "they" you're talking about! And what interest do"they" hold in "creating a narrative" :)

       "PR doesn't deal in opinions, PR deals in realities" -Edward Bernays
It's within the scope of practice for any civilization to build a common narrative to galvanize and direct the populace, from Egypt to the Vatican
      </p>
      <p>
       As to the "they", atomically within the case of MK Ultra we would be talking about the darker sides of the CIA particularly those individuals and ideologies who were brought into the fold through operation paperclip from the SS and Ahnenerbe, which were conducting similar experiments during WW2

       You have forgotten that for several years including 2008, no official Republican was allowed to question the official 9/11 narrative and that Obama was forced to abandon Van Jones because he had signed a petition asking for a new review of that event.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was very political, and that after the Bush and MSM, severely attacked any dissenters to the official story that included labeling them insane crackpots.

       That kind of stuff happens all the time.  I am now using my 4th computer of this year. Attacks are common if you don't jump on the bandwagon and if the majority of your comments aren't removed you aren't working hard enough for your ideas.

       uh, there's been a misunderstanding. I'm not advocating for the trade of consumers information, in fact i'm considering switching to a new search motor. What I meant is, I don't have anything meaningful to hide, doesn't mean I endorse data collecting. Was just trying to be humorous :)
