    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve kinda been wondering lately about if its possible this was supposed to be 9/11. If you remember there was early reports that middle eastern people was seen there or running away, something to that effect. Especially considering 2 years earlier the first WTC attack happened. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This was supposed to be the Militant White Tribe uprising. After Ruby Ridge and Waco this was a <em>wake up call</em> to many good citizens that were Constitutionally barking back against the Government. </p>

<p>Lived down in Utah when the first two happened and had transferred to Oak Ridge when OKC happened. Holy shit it was something! </p>

<p>We had to have a visit from the MIB because someone claimed some yokel from INEL had shit in his car trunk and blah blah blah. Somehow connected to OKC?! BS! </p>

<p>When OKC hit I was sitting in Pocatello about a mile from the FBI with my dying MIL and they goddamned well knew it because of our Credit Cards. Bizarre shit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I remember right afterwards they were going after the militias. At the time I was like what?  What does that have to do with the bombing?   Now I know exactly why they was doing it. And its why you said here. There was opposition to what the &quot;powers that be&quot; was trying to do, so there had to be new laws implemented to weaken the strength of the militias. Sad. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Tension is required. Makes me sick!</p>

<p>James Corbett does a great <em>theory</em> on little Timmy. The OKC bombing took so many other lives in that Scripted Shit Show the Government orchestrated. </p>

<p>And Retired Gen. Stubblebine (?) gives a good BS analysis to the bomb crater.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s always two ways of doing it, that&#39;s the point of the other person that disappeared.</p>

<p>Plan #1: Timothy McVeigh discredits militia movement.</p>

<p>Plan #2: Muslims did it.</p>

<p>You don&#39;t do a plan this big without an audible should things go wrong in operations, media, or public opinion.</p>

<p>Also, it&#39;s beautiful as it fucks up Occam&#39;s Razor. By adding these weird details that could have pointed to another conspiracy, but didn&#39;t, you violate Occam&#39;s Razor. People just dismiss things out of hand as being &quot;crazy&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...<em>Other Web sites carry photos of a Ryder truck parked at a military installation in Oklahoma, where conspiracy-minded investigators contend the fertilizer bomb was assembled.</em></p>

<p><em>The Oklahoma National Guard confirmed Friday that the aerial photos were indeed taken above Camp Gruber in the fall of 1994 and said the classified project involved weapons sensors and was overseen by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency. The National Guard&#39;s statement said the truck &quot;had no association whatsoever with the tragedy at the Alfred P. Murrah Building.</em>&quot; </p>
