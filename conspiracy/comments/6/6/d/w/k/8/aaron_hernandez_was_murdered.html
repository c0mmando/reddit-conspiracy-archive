       With the shocking news that Aaron Hernandez had committed suicide this morning in his cell, I instantly thought something was fishy. Take a look at this screenshot from a CNN article months before his "suicide".

       After looking at this, ask yourself, is it really probable that the one of the MOST high-tech prisons out of the 1,821 prisons in the US that has 365 cameras didn't see anything? This is highly doubtful and definitely needs to be looked into further.

       he only beat a double murder case because he killed the person who's suppose to be the witness for that case, and that's what he's in jail for.

       I see the point , but the only reason he beat the double murder is because he committed another one and got convicted for it, it doesn't really count.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know which murder he had potential of beating, I lost count at the amount of murder he committed.
      </p>
      <p>
       but he's a big guy, you know how many people you would need to keep him down? it would have make a scene and a bunch of noise..
      </p>
      <p>
       you would need the entire guards to be in on it, that's just too much.

       You think that isn't possible? Guards? With weapons? Blood found on the wall? John 3:16 written on his OWN FOREHEAD? Still, can't take murder off the table.

       He wasn't murdered. He killed himself because of abatement. In MA when someone dies in custody their charges are basically wiped clean.
      </p>
      <p>
       Meaning; Odin Lloyd's family can't seek a civil suit against Hernandez's estate because technically his conviction will be overturned.
      </p>
      <p>
       That means that his wife and, more so his daughter will now be set up well for life because his estate will go to them.

       This is correct. There will still be a civil suit. His family now has a chance for some of his NFL money though the Patriots will most likely fight it unless Kraft feels bad for his family and offers them a number to make it all go away.

       This is correct. The civil suits will likely go forward, BUT they cannot use his criminal conviction against him in the civil trial because of abatement. (I am a lawyer in MA.)

       I immediately thought he was murdered.  I was watching ESPN earlier.  The anchor was talking to some lady about the situation.  She was saying that his agent, who was very close to him, said there was no chance he committed suicide.  At the end of the segment, ESPN pulled a very CNN move by cutting this lady's mic on air.  Thought that was fishy as fuck.

       Careful. I was downvoted to hell for suggesting this earlier. Being downvoted is fine, but it shows how lacking people are in critical thought on maters like this. That prison isn't a run down shit hole with outdated technology and inept staff. It's a place where he couldn't have suicided himself unless the opportunity, tools and time necessary was explicitly given to him.

       I got ultra-downvoted earlier too lol; but very, VERY well said. Even if we wasn't murdered, like you said, he was explicitly given everything to do so while the guards turned a blind eye.

       in my state rounds are tracked and required every 30 minutes and they DO get done on all shifts.  the problem is if a guy wants to kill himself, he only needs to wait until about 820 right after an 815 round while all the guards are playing cards in between rounds. gives dude 25 minutes to hang and trust me round times at 30 minutes is hard to keep up with in an RHU as it is.  He couldve killed himself, but if he were on any type of suicide watch it wouldnt make sense. Ive known inmates that seemed happy then offed themselves the next day though.

       Like you said, he was on suicide watch, yet was also in a good mood. The only thing that makes complete sense would be murder. Plus, do you have any proof you worked in prisons?

       You aren't thinking critically, you're thinking cinematically. Do you really think that it is "highly doubtful" that one of 365 cameras captured the suicide of one of 1400 prisoners? Especially when those cameras are likely trained on common areas?

       I don't know what I think about his death. But, I do know a little about life in prison. I'm throwing this out there, in case it can help picture his situation a little better.
      </p>
      <p>
       One of the articles state that he was in max security, which isn't gen pop. Most max security situations keep you locked in your cell alone almost constantly. Its pretty much solitary.
      </p>
      <p>
       The article also stated that he was close to a review to be transferred to medium security, which would be your average general population situation. He would have been able to move around, potentially have a job, have better visitations, etc... The move would have made a significant difference in his quality of life.
      </p>
      <p>
       The timing just doesn't seem right. There were still too many balls in the air that could have worked out in his favor.

       Do you know how easy it is to suffocate yourself with a sheet? It takes only 6 minutes before you're completely brain dead. AT MOST - a guard saw him in the act on camera and said "oh well" ... either way that's not murder. Move along

       I was hoping I would see a post for this here.    I immediately thought murder as well.  Number of things were fishy, including how much it was emphasized that his cell door was 'jammed shut from the inside'.     Who do you guys think did it?   Inmates, guards or both?

       I'm really pointing at guards because inmates wouldn't make it look pretty at all or try to hang him. Definitely guards.

       Is it really that silly, though? You could still obviously see what's on the screen in person, and the guards are trained to look for such behavior, so how is that not plausible?

       Honestly though, I think he got what he deserved in the end.  He murdered someone, it just came back on him in the end.  But it wasn't suicide.  That's bullshit.

       I got ultra-downvoted earlier too lol; but very, VERY well said. Even if we wasn't murdered, like you said, he was explicitly given everything to do so while the guards turned a blind eye.

       This is correct. There will still be a civil suit. His family now has a chance for some of his NFL money though the Patriots will most likely fight it unless Kraft feels bad for his family and offers them a number to make it all go away.
