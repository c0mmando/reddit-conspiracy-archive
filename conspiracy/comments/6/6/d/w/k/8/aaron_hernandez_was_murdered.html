Take a look at this screenshot from a CNN article months before his &quot;suicide&quot;. <a href="http://imgur.com/a/WlLWe">http://imgur.com/a/WlLWe</a> After looking at this, ask yourself, is it really probable that the one of the MOST high-tech prisons out of the 1,821 prisons in the US that has 365 cameras didn&#39;t see anything? This is highly doubtful and definitely needs to be looked into further.</p>

<p>Meaning; Odin Lloyd&#39;s family can&#39;t seek a civil suit against Hernandez&#39;s estate because technically his conviction will be overturned. </p>

<p>That means that his wife and, more so his daughter will now be set up well for life because his estate will go to them. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>in my state rounds are tracked and required every 30 minutes and they DO get done on all shifts.  the problem is if a guy wants to kill himself, he only needs to wait until about 820 right after an 815 round while all the guards are playing cards in between rounds. gives dude 25 minutes to hang and trust me round times at 30 minutes is hard to keep up with in an RHU as it is.  He couldve killed himself, but if he were on any type of suicide watch it wouldnt make sense. Ive known inmates that seemed happy then offed themselves the next day though.</p>

<p>One of the articles state that he was in max security, which isn&#39;t gen pop. Most max security situations keep you locked in your cell alone almost constantly. Its pretty much solitary. </p>

<p>The article also stated that he was close to a review to be transferred to medium security, which would be your average general population situation. He would have been able to move around, potentially have a job, have better visitations, etc... The move would have made a significant difference in his quality of life. </p>
