    <div class="md"><p>Probably not, it&#39;s based off a book, if anything this show prevents suicide. The message at the end I thought was fairly strong. We ignore people in our lives but we don&#39;t know the damage it causes, and the guy went out of his way to be nice to that other girl who cuts her self.</p>

<p>But the end was also kind of stupid, I mean they drove off into the sunset like they survived an intense thriller or war. Like No you people just didn&#39;t commit suicide lol it&#39;s not A huge feat.</p>

<p>Something like pirates of the Caribbean or lord of the rings when their in the sunset enjoying a pint that is well deserved.. This wasn&#39;t deserved imo that drive off in the sunset</p>

    <div class="md"><p>TL:DR </p>

<p>Short answer: Trump is very good at invoking powerful spirits. </p>

<p>So we have the &quot;siren&quot; on the front of the cup.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.starbucks.com/blog/so-who-is-the-siren">https://www.starbucks.com/blog/so-who-is-the-siren</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/the-siren-on-your-starbucks-cup-was-born-in-7thcentury-italy">http://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/the-siren-on-your-starbucks-cup-was-born-in-7thcentury-italy</a></p>

<p>So, sirens would use &quot;fake love&quot; to lure men in to their deaths (the gist of it). </p>

<p>This particular &quot;siren&quot; originally had two tails in a spread eagle position (fertility goddess would partly be my guess). Who else are some fertility goddesses? Isis, Diana... Everything is pretty black and white no? Especially the lines on the &quot;sirens&quot; tails on the cup.</p>

<p>Also we have the concept of Simbi: Simbi is the collective name for a very diverse group of ancient  ancestral spirits, who come from the Kikongo area of West Central  Africa. Kongo spirituality is particularly sophisticated and creative.  The Kongo world view divides into two pieces - heaven being the place of the gods and the earth the domain of the mortals. Between these two  worlds lies a vast sea, an ocean of fluid that spirits traverse in their move between the two domains. Here is where the Simbis live. In Kongo  spirituality there is recognized a spiritual hierarchy. Immediately  above living humans are the ancestors, or Nkuyu. These are the ancestors who are named. Above them, and more removed from humans, are the Simbi. In the Kongo belief system, all Simbi (also called Basimbi for plural  and Kisimbi) are associated with water. They are the source of special  blessings but are known to be somewhat unpredictable. They are also said to be &quot;twice born&quot; which means that they have not lived recently on  earth.(<a href="http://www.inquincesweb.com">www.inquincesweb.com</a>, accessed 4/5/04) Hence, they are a higher  class of ancestors, having been elevated by death to a higher status  than humans, yet still available to us for consultation and service.&quot; <a href="http://www.sosyetedumarche.com/html/simbi.html">http://www.sosyetedumarche.com/html/simbi.html</a></p>

<p>Next we have the coffee cup. Usually is says merry christmas but Starbucks decided to use a red cover to cover up (the merry christmas part). Now, I don&#39;t think I need to put up links here. People getting angry because they believe it to be Christ birthday...</p>

<p>Now Paris, the city of Love, in Graham Hancocks book the Master Game (GO READ IT) it shows how Paris is designed much like Ancient Egypt (Washington DC as well).  These are hubs are where the spirit world comes together with this plane of existence. Egyptians believed they could charge up entire structures with their gods so the gods lived throughout the city.</p>

<p>Look up the order of baphomets logo compared to starbucks</p>

<p>Essentially what I am trying to get at (not saying in any way is it true. Just noticing the syncs) is that Starbucks, who invokes a pagan (forgive me for the term, it&#39;s the easiest one) fertility goddess (who may or may not lure men and drown them) on their logo, covered up the Merry Christmas around the holiday season with a red (color of extremes) cup. 
Then the master of turning everything on its head (look up Crowley, law of reversals etc... Trump is good) comes out and states that Starbucks is attacking love and christ and christmas by doing this. Soon after in the City of Love at a Eagles of Death Metal (Flying metal death machines, hows that for an image, also anyone know Trumps family crest?), while the band was playing &quot;kiss the devil&quot;, gunmen opened fire which lead to the death of 130 people. </p>

<p>That looks like a real life manifestation of fear. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I did notice I was watching marathons, instead of regular sleeping hours, but it&#39;s just a better coping option than cable tv w ads, booze, drugs or sex. I&#39;m only harming myself by watching all fucking 8 seasons of <em>Gilmore Girls</em>. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hooked up with cabled screens again after years not relying on television both for entertainment and knowledge. </p>

<p>I observed that cable shows mostly induces fear, terror and impractical knowledge. No need to discuss the gun-slinging and explosive films. And the doubt hyped inducing crimes committed by people shown on the news, while not balancing it with enough solutions and the good things happening in this world.</p>

<p>For example, why hype the fear factor of the most dangerous the nature&#39;s got if they could instead show solutions for us to ride and survive along the dangers of nature?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Worse than tv, I&#39;m noticing corporate radio ads, through local DJs. Not the ads themselves, but the scripted little sound bites between songs. If some Americans are not even watching TV anymore, because of streaming services, and only get thier news through radio and facebook filters, that&#39;s even scarier than the people who religiously watch the 24 hour news channels! </p>

<p>I overheard 2 community college 18 year olds today, being instructed by a librarian, on how to use a website for research and they couldn&#39;t even follow a fuckin powerpoint of the webpage that was also on the school provided netbook in front of them. They were clueless about basic functions of a library, print media and the internet as anything but entertainment. It&#39;s terrifying. </p>

<p>And I&#39;m going to disagree that there&#39;s no evidence at hand. It&#39;s absolutely everywhere, but the culture is so deeply entrenched in that fear propaganda, ingrained denial and herd/authoritarian mentality that even if a &quot;concrete&quot; evidentiary event happened, most would defend the status quo. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is probably because there is already a rise in suicide and the media is just cashing in on a terrible trend.  They certainly perpetuate the trend by making it &quot;fashionable&quot;, and &quot;cool&quot; I&#39;m not sure what the word I&#39;m looking for is, but I&#39;m sure you get my point.  </p>

I did and was bored as fuck, too many sjw messages, irrelevant dialogues. In short it&#39;s about a girl blaming herself and others for why she commited suicide and I didn&#39;t feel like watching that piece of shit. Directing and editing didn&#39;t fit my taste at all. So I told to my friend that I wasn&#39;t in a super happy mode myself so I simply didn&#39;t want to feel extra shitty.
