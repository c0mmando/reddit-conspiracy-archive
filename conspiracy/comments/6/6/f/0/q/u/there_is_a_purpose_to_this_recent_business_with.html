       There were several mainstream sources that have recently covered Alex Jones divorce court revelations, being described as an "actor" by his lawyer.
      </p>
      <p>
       He was mentioned on a hit piece by Stephen Colbert, The Daily Show, and even CNN the other day, all these MSM outlets covering him in unison.
      </p>

      </p>
      <p>
       I've been seeing TONS of comments on his YouTube videos calling him out, which I initially thought was good.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then I began to think, and notice the wording of some of these comments.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        "Turns out jones is just all an act...he has been making up all this new world order stuff for years"
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       And
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        "Ha! Told you conspiracy theorists were all wrong. Can't believe you thought 9/11 was actually fake! And bilderberg was real...Idiots...AJ is all an act!"
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       This is problematic for us guys, do you see the effect at play?^
      </p>
      <p>
       The MSM coverage, coupled with these recent responses from the masses, and AJ's likely deep state/CIA gatekeeper credentials, tells me there is a purpose to this....
      </p>
      <p>
       They are using him, once again, as bait, to try and discredit the INFORMATION surrounding conspiracy theories. If they tarnish Jones (the alleged "alternative media leader"), they could potentially tarnish our entire collective of information and beliefs. Our culture could take a serious hit with this.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now I think jones is a fucking puppet personally, however he has talked about true things. That's the art of a gatekeeper, mixing in 90% truths, with some lies, and "guarding the gate" of the really important stuff (Israelis involvement in 9/11, Pizzagate, ect).
      </p>
      <p>
       Some of his supporters see this as an attack to "discredit him by the MSM", however I know what they are trying to do here...
      </p>
      <p>
       We need to make two things known here:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         We have to distance ourselves from jones
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         We have to defend against the inevitable attacks from people saying that the things we believe (even confirmed conspiracies) are not "fake", and just because Alex jones is an actor, and he may have woken some people up to them, doesn't mean they are fake too.
        </p>

       Good point, this is why I've always disliked his methods and vitrol. I agree with some things he's said though. I don't think I'd give him the benefit of ninety percent truth, but the accompanying insanity and hatred just bring it all down to a scuzzy level.

       Yes, I agree. It's the

       he presents these truths. Remember his interview about gun rights on piers  Morgan?

       He looked like a total loony tune to anybody who is "on the fence" on the issue. That's the genius of AJ. He is being advised/guided by his CIA/MOSSAD counsellors i assume. He is a useful tool to them, an "insider". Like an undercover cop.

       This seems like a desperate attempt to justify a dude who makes millions of dollars spinning yarn. He must be in on the conspiracy! So TPTB chose this guy to tell everyone the truth about a bunch of conspiracies and then made his lawyer tell the world it was all in act so people wouldn't believe Alex anymore? Why have him say all the shit in the first place? It makes no sense dude. He's just a loony asshole spreading bullshit and making millions of dollars selling purified water to people who think the world is about to end.

       Lol your "take" on it is such a generalization. What do you
       <em>
        really
       </em>
       think is happening? Think hard...

       There is always something going on behind the scenes...if the MSM didn't pick this up, It wouldn't be
       <em>

       weird...but they did, like they always do, and thats usually a blatant red herring. Especially since they all
Came out in unison together, coordinated, premeditated.

       Lol your take is pathetic. Clearly it doesn't feel very good to find out this guy is a phony after following everything he's said for years I'm guessing. Alex Jones is buddy buddy with Trump. The media have covered him plenty of times. Alex Jones thinks the government is making the frogs gay. He's wither mentally insane or clearly a performance artist making millions of dollars selling bullshit to idiots.

       Yeah I just don't think Sandy hook was a hoax and I don't think the government cares if the frogs are gay. I also think Alex Jones is an idiot and you guys should have probably seen through his act a long time ago. He's not a pon for TPTB. He's just a con man taking money from scared people.

       Yes, finally someone who outlines jones' BIGGER purpose...

       If you were creating a new world order, and you anticipated an inevitable "resistance" or "revolution" from the masses, you would plant
       <strong>
        your own guy
       </strong>
       as the head of that resistance, pretending to be the leader, who will expose the truth. That's How a "gatekeeper" or a "shill" is born essentially...

       Even AJ's followers don't follow him religiously. He makes the same appeals to authority MSM does, which weakens his credibility. His apology for pgate was blatant damage control for a lawsuit. AJ is not very good controlled opposition

       Wouldn't make much sense if he was.

       Why make your own conspiracy theorist? Or even make a big deal about him? All they're doing is getting people to believe in conspiracy theories with that planning.

       It doesn't make a bit of difference if he doesn't attack this or that. He is a platform that could potentially inspire people to go after corruption in various areas of the world.
