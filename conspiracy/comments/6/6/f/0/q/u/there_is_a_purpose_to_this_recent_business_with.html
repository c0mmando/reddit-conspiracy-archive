        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">22</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2017-04-20 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/forefather6667.html">forefather6667</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>There were several mainstream sources that have recently covered Alex Jones divorce court revelations, being described as an &quot;actor&quot; by his lawyer. </p>

<p>He was mentioned on a hit piece by Stephen Colbert, The Daily Show, and even CNN the other day, all these MSM outlets covering him in unison. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qBNml_sSVo&amp;t=145s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qBNml_sSVo&amp;t=145s</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIUaRgwJshE">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIUaRgwJshE</a></p>

<p>I&#39;ve been seeing TONS of comments on his YouTube videos calling him out, which I initially thought was good.</p>

<p>Then I began to think, and notice the wording of some of these comments.</p>

<p><strong>&quot;Turns out jones is just all an act...he has been making up all this new world order stuff for years&quot;</strong></p>

<p>And </p>

<p><strong>&quot;Ha! Told you conspiracy theorists were all wrong. Can&#39;t believe you thought 9/11 was actually fake! And bilderberg was real...Idiots...AJ is all an act!&quot;</strong></p>

<p>This is problematic for us guys, do you see the effect at play?^</p>

<p>The MSM coverage, coupled with these recent responses from the masses, and AJ&#39;s likely deep state/CIA gatekeeper credentials, tells me there is a purpose to this....</p>

<p>They are using him, once again, as bait, to try and discredit the INFORMATION surrounding conspiracy theories. If they tarnish Jones (the alleged &quot;alternative media leader&quot;), they could potentially tarnish our entire collective of information and beliefs. Our culture could take a serious hit with this.</p>

<p>Now I think jones is a fucking puppet personally, however he has talked about true things. That&#39;s the art of a gatekeeper, mixing in 90% truths, with some lies, and &quot;guarding the gate&quot; of the really important stuff (Israelis involvement in 9/11, Pizzagate, ect).</p>

<p>Some of his supporters see this as an attack to &quot;discredit him by the MSM&quot;, however I know what they are trying to do here...</p>

<p>We need to make two things known here:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>We have to distance ourselves from jones </p></li>
<li><p>We have to defend against the inevitable attacks from people saying that the things we believe (even confirmed conspiracies) are not &quot;fake&quot;, and just because Alex jones is an actor, and he may have woken some people up to them, doesn&#39;t mean they are fake too.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>^ this guy sees it.</p>

<p>Yes, I agree. It&#39;s the <em>way</em> he presents these truths. Remember his interview about gun rights on piers  Morgan? </p>

<p>&quot;1776 WILL COMMENCE AGAIN, if you try to take our firearms away!!!&quot;</p>

<p>He looked like a total loony tune to anybody who is &quot;on the fence&quot; on the issue. That&#39;s the genius of AJ. He is being advised/guided by his CIA/MOSSAD counsellors i assume. He is a useful tool to them, an &quot;insider&quot;. Like an undercover cop. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This seems like a desperate attempt to justify a dude who makes millions of dollars spinning yarn. He must be in on the conspiracy! So TPTB chose this guy to tell everyone the truth about a bunch of conspiracies and then made his lawyer tell the world it was all in act so people wouldn&#39;t believe Alex anymore? Why have him say all the shit in the first place? It makes no sense dude.
