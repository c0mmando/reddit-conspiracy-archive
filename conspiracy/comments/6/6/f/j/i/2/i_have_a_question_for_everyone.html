       I don't know if I'm breaking any sub rules or asking the right question to the wrong place, but I have to ask. I don't really know anywhere else to turn; every other sub seems biased or compromised. Here's my question: Why, when there is an obvious abuse of power by the government, most Europeans seem to flood the streets and get together, protest. I see pictures on reddit of massive crowds basically putting major cities on lock down or a total hult. Meanwhile, the American government has been breaking UN laws and also screwing over the American people. Yet Americans do nothing about it. Protests here and there, but nothing worth posting on r/pics. Is it because we are a "young" country? Is our media too corrupt? Are Americans too spread out and diverse to really come together and fight a common cause?
      </p>
      <p>
       I ask this as someone who knows I'm being fucked, and has been fucked my entire life. Paying taxes to supply wars to wars don't want and, I feel, most Americans don't want. Propaganda is strong in the world today; I just want to know how bad off America is.... I really would like to discuss this. With my country's  (I'm American) government trying to strong arm the world, I genuinely am scared. I don't want to lose the chance to travel the world and meet amazing people just because appointed government officials or deep state bombed them.
      </p>
      <p>
       (Rambling aside, I'm slightly drunk, why are Europeans and/or South Koreans able to feel the need(and actually do it) to come together and protest, unlike Americans?) Where is the outrage?
      </p>
      <p>
       I love everyone on this sub. And I want to say thank you for being, at least to me, a last becon of hope for open mindedness and scepticism of those in power.

       I think the reason why Americans don't get out and protest the government is because we have it pretty good compared to the rest of the world. Sure there's a big divide between the elites and the rest of the country, but to many other people in the world, even poor Americans are living in luxury. For most, there is no immediate danger and in many ways we are benefiting from the American abuse of power throughout the world. That doesn't make it right, but I think that's why people here don't give a damn.

       Dam. That definitely hit home towards the end there.

       I'm actually not too sure how to answer your question. I too, have been asking myself this for a very long time...I think it could be an irrational fear of our government. In fact...its probably more rational (now that I think about it) with all the propaganda and what not that we have here. We seem to have this mentality of "Well, if it ain't hurtin' me...then...ya know. Fuck it rignt."

       We're effectively pacified and confused- the confusion being more powerful than anything else. No one in America knows what is true anymore because we're overloaded with constant information and purposefully lead down the wrong paths at every turn. You start looking into one fucky thing and you end up on a wasted trip that leads you to satanism. Go down another path and find out you wasted a trip that lead you to Goldman Sachs.
      </p>
      <p>
       The well is so poisoned and the information so diluted that it's easier to just go back to being pacified than it is to try and find out what the hell is really going on- and all of this is by design.

       I can confirm.  I consider myself pretty a pretty well read, open-minded critical thinker.  And I can't figure out what the fuck is going on these days.  Conspiracies and dissonance at every turn, you think you have a handle on a simple piece of information and then some blowhard comes along and says you're a mindless shill and, because you are a critical thinker, you stop and second guess yourself and go back to research again and have the same findings.  And this happens

       There's some truth to Goldman Sachs stuff but as for Satanism, anytime you're lead to believe that Satanism is behind something- you've been duped. The satanism links are always bullshit and it's usually military intelligence. Satanism is the best artificial gatekeeper in the history of mankind. The links never go anywhere and always explain everything away as being weird shit satanists do- which is just never the case.

        But back to the claims of Satanic activity. This is a common ploy used by the CIA and FBI, to lead investigators into dark alleys. Long ago I learned that anytime I am being led into Satanism, Crowley, LaVey, and similar channels, I should know that the CIA is trying to divert me. It isn't Satanists that are running these events, it is most often military intelligence. But the black agencies use Satanism to cover their tracks. For most researchers, Satanism is a sexier road than the road to G-men, and they willingly take it. Rule number one in researching false flag events: ignore all links that lead to Satanism. Those are sucker links, put there on purpose by the CIA writers.

       I laughed at this, but I think it hits on something.  For some reason Americans seem to love hero worshiping authority.  Government, cops, military.  I respect all three, but I also think all three are fallible.  And when that happens it is our job as citizens to rise up, speak out and push back when necessary.  But Americans don't like that idea much.  Which is odd, as our history began with defiance.

       Yep, this too.  As a woman who march in the Women's March, I was completely disowned by 98% of my family for that reason alone.  They were aghast and furious.  The same family who was a bunch of anti-authority, hellraising bikers and hippies in their youth.  It was confusing to say the very least.

       The leaders advocated violence in blowing up the white house. Why anyone would allow Sarsour a platform with her unsavory past is beyond me.

       The womens march was a fucking joke. My rights as a woman have never been infringed upon. It was the biggest bunch of shit I ever saw. Really what rights of your have been infringed upon ? What rights has he taken away? All that was about was killing babies through late term abortions. How is naming a hat after a derogatory term for a womans vagina helping your cause? It just makes feminists look ridiculous and takes away from your cause. Why follow a woman who kidnapped and tortured a man (hylton)? Why follow a woman who threatens to blow up the whitehouse (madonna)? Why follow a woman who is a known terrorist  (sarsour)? Maybe that is why your family is against it.

       I agree that the woman's march was a joke and I am a woman. We are the 99%. If we keep allowing ourselves to be devided by gender, race, sexual orientation etc...the 1% will continue to screw all of us. Identity politics is exactly where TPTB want us focused while we all slave away.

       That's really great for you.  I've never been profiled because of the way I look, but it doesn't mean it isn't happening to thousands of other people.  My rights as a woman
       <em>
        have
       </em>
       been infringed upon - literally. I won't argue the pay gap or gender stereotypes, so I'll keep it personal by saying I've been assaulted a number of times - by family, friends and strangers.  I was told every time that it's part of being a woman and to just let it go.  Our president normalized that behavior and many defended it.  So if nothing else, women marched in solidarity against the idea that we are here for men's pleasure.

       You are incredibly misinformed.  3-4 million people didn't march
       <em>

       because of late term abortions (which for the record is only 1.3% of abortions).  Many marched to support Planned Parenthood, the nation's number one provider of women's healthcare.  But I knew at least a dozen Pro-Life people who participated and dozens and
       <em>
        dozens
       </em>
       of people participating who are against late term abortions altogether.

       I followed none of those people.  In fact, I don't know who 2 out of the 3 are.  The other (Madonna) is a provocateur, so whatever. 
 Technically, I followed an Episcopalian priest and a Girl Scout Troop.  Metaphorically I follow no one.  Again, 3-4 million people were involved in that march.  It's safe to say I would easily disagree with 80% of them on one thing or another.  Do you "follow" Ann Coulter?  Do you "follow" the guy who shot up a pizzaria because Alex Jones told him there were children being held hostage in a basement?  We can be alike AND different - it's called nuance.

       My family was against it because they feel I should be in the kitchen making sandwiches for my husband.  They believe I didn't need a college education, they believe I shouldn't work, they believe my place is in the home taking orders from my husband and caring full-time for my children.  My family is also poor and very uneducated and resent me trying to be anything different than them.  Which is sad.

       Maybe you should do some research on those people and  stop being uninformed. And to be honest were you even there? I wasn't but i know who the people were speaking Donna Hylton and Linda Sarsour. 
Trumps grab by the pussy: I have heard women say worse than  that. 
And if you have been assaulted why the hell did you not learn self defense.Do you like being a victim? I know self defense for my personal protection. But okay keep wearing that victim label with pride. 
If you family is that bad why not cut them out of your life and move on? I cut my paranoid schizphrenic sister out of my life because she refuses help.  Do i feel bad about it? No I did what needed to be done to make my life better. 
And where is your actual proof other than the grab them by the pussy comment that he assaulted women? Show me. I bet you can't though because there is none.

       If only I had a dollar for every time I've now been called a "shill" in this sub for expressing my critical thought...  Let's define that word so everyone can be clear:

       noun
1.
an accomplice of a hawker, gambler, or swindler who acts as an enthusiastic customer to entice or encourage others.

       Expressing my perspective or opinion does not make me a shill.  I have no agenda.  I really don't care what you believe.  I appreciate others' perspective, so I offer my own when the opportunity comes up.  So quit with the shill labeling, it's boring and lazy.

       I was a child during most of the assaults.  Did I purport myself to be a victim?  No I did not.  Stating what happened to me and reporting on a systemic issue doesn't mean I'm wearing a victim label.  However, your response
       <strong>
        is

       I never cut my family out because it's family.  I spent many (many) years respecting our differences and thought they would do the same.  They did not.  So it goes.  I never once said Trump was the reason they are the way they are because, yes, they've always been that way.
       <em>
        Which is part of the problem.

       And you got me, I don't have proof Trump normalized assault.  But the fact that so many defended his comment is definitely a problem.

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       What proof are you asking for again?  That he's a misogynist?  If you can't already see the evidence there (and there's more than enough), there's nothing I can supply that will change your mind.  As he, himself, said... He can shoot a man in Times Square and his supporters will continue to support him.  Guess you are one of those people.

       A shill, also called a plant or a stooge, is a person who publicly helps or gives credibility to a person or organization without disclosing that they have a close relationship with the person or organization. Shills can carry out their operations in the areas of media, journalism, marketing, confidence games, or other business areas. A shill may also act to discredit opponents or critics of the person or organization in which they have a vested interest through character assassination or other means. proof:
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shill">
        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shill
       </a>
       Looks like you are uninformed then on what a shill really is. 
I knew you had no proof on him assaulting women. And the rape of a child that case never went to court. 
As to the victim blaming I was not. But I think everyone should learn self defense. I  just don't understand why if you had been assaulted you would not learn basic self defense to protect your self. It is as simple as that. 
And as for cutting out people in your life who are toxic like your family is only going to help you get out of negative situations and bring  positive influences in your life not negative ones. That is not victim blaming . Nice try. I think you really need to think about what you wrote and think rationally.
      </p>
      <p>
       So go ahead and keep spouting stuff with no real proof.

       Fair enough, I used the Dictionary instead of Wikipedia.  I wouldn't consider that uninformed, but okay whatever.  For the record, I am not a shill as I have no close relationship or vested interest with any organizers of the women's march.  Hell, I didn't even know who they were until you mentioned them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, I don't care to discuss Trump, that's a nowhere issue when it comes to his supporters.  I responded only because it related to the pussy hats.  For me, the march wasn't about him.  It was about systemic issues I'd love to see addressed.  It was about solidarity and support.
      </p>
      <p>
       You are assuming I don't know self-defense, which is a bad assumption to make as I'm a green belt in karate (not that it's at all relevant).  But I wasn't as a kid.  Even if I were, it would not have made a bit of difference when it's considered acceptable for men to assault children.  I think all the time on my stances on issues.  I adjust my perspective repeatedly.  Rationality is not a problem on my end.

       Yeah it is uninformed no matter how you look at it. And you did bring up Trump first. Not me. So yeah you trying to rationalize being uniformed with the women's march on dc is just not rational. Have a great day. 
Why did i make assumptions? You made assumptions about me first not me. All I did was ask simple questions. Sucks when people assume things about you huh?

       That's like asking how a public rally helps change an opinion on
       <em>
        anything
       </em>
       .  I wasn't around, but I imagine many said the same about civil rights demonstrations.  I
       <strong>
        know
       </strong>
       people said the same about gay rights rallies.  Tea partiers did it, as well as Occupy Wall Street.  The answer is always the same in my mind:  it brings awareness.
      </p>
      <p>
       For the Women's March, it invalidated the normalization of sexual assault or harassment of women.  It empowered women around the world and let them know they weren't alone.  In fact 3-4 million people across the globe marched together in solidarity in support of women's issues.  Assault, harassment, domestic violence, birth control, healthcare, equal pay, equal opportunities and, for some places, freedom at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       OP asked the question: "Why, when there is an obvious abuse of power by the government, most Europeans seem to flood the streets and get together, protest."  Yes Americans don't - why?
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd say the answer lies right here in the comments.

       Part of the reason we all accept getting our asses plowed is because we have a two party system here. The Trump supporters are too caught up on drinking librul tears and the Democrats are too caught up on laughing at every stupid thing he says. This country is cowboys vs redskins and we rarely stop to think about the big picture. Our education is awful too. A lot of people are more concerned with rooting for a rooting for a team than actual policies. Tons of people wanted the ACA but they also wanted to repeal Obamacare. Americans are stupid. And finding our team corner and staying there is how we stay stupid.

       I have a friend who recently told me the very same thing.  It actually helped me understand, and relax, about the current state of politics.  You can't convince a Bears fan to regard the Patriots any more than you can convince a devout Republican to understand where the Democrats are coming from (and vice versa).

       Solid post OP.
I could not agree with you more. My experience with friends, family members and co-workers seems to be pretty consistent. They seem to take information at face value. Our society seems to be rooted in quick consumption, disposability, and impulse.
      </p>
      <p>
       We read the headlines that we are fed, nothing more and then form an opinion based on said headline or the interpretation of the headline from guy in the next cubicle. So many people that I know, never ask questions or ask why. They don't seem to have the time or interest to look into events and form their own opinions.
      </p>
      <p>
       What percentage of opinion are based on what people read on someones FB post, snap-story or 140 character opinion. Quick, disposable consumption and then we seem to be onto the next thing, never asking why.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also think we are selfish and lack passion. We are all out for ourselves and are afraid to stick our neck out for what we believe in. Not necessary because we are going to be thrown in the clink, but because we care too much about what our neighbor thinks and we don't want to come off as some kook, put our job at risk or invest any of our precious time in a "revolution".
      </p>
      <p>
       Groups decide to march...they march for an evening, maybe even a day. In other countries they dig in, they commit. Is it because they do not have a warm home to go back to or a job to be at the next day or is it because they value their future that much?
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't have any answers, but I certainly don't like whats going on. This young county is a mess and we as citizens don't seem to have the balls to stand up and take an honest, resilient and long-term stand.

       Because Europeans and South Koreans are not pacified enough to go along everything that the government throws on them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes, Europe is infested with Muslim Armymen Age "Immigrants" that will purge the population when the time strikes -- But most of them are opposed to it, the government is just too persistent, stubborn and controlled for them to resist completely.
      </p>
      <p>
       Americans in the other hand believe that they are living in some sort of stable superpower and has lost complete grip on reality. They think that everything will be over and it's the end of all wars, without any knowledge that the powers that be's minions like Obama, Trump, Hillary and Soros are slowly destroying it from the inside. Many of them also lack a fundamental knowledge and some can't even point where the USA is in a map. They are so pacified and sterilized that they are unlikely to protest whatsoever. The same applies to Japan and Australia.

       Everyone is afraid to say how they feel, for fear of retribution. But I think for most whom the light is on, they are waiting for the spark to hit the tinder. And TPTB know this, and that's why we have identity politics, and PC culture in general.

       America has very few organic protests. And those don't get any media coverage. (Like when 100s of thousands converged to protest abortion, it was like it never happened, so far as the press was concerned. Even when the Vice-President went down to give a speech and support the protestors.)
      </p>
      <p>
       The only "protests" that get wall-to-wall coverage are the synthetic ones, paid for by George Soros. Where all the "protestors" are actually paid agitators shipped in on air-conditioned buses by Soros front groups.
      </p>
      <p>
       In essence, they're actors.
      </p>
      <p>
       (Hint: Real protestors don't get paid.)
      </p>
      <p>
       So what we have are all these synthetic race riots and gender rebellion charades . . . all of which serve the globalist divide-and-conquer methodology.
      </p>
      <p>
       Grassroots events that originate with the actual people (but that don't serve these globalist interests) are utterly shut out of the media, and a conspiracy of silence smothers them out of existence.

       Excellent response. I think you hit the nail on the head.
      </p>
      <p>
       Has America definitely passed the point where the citizenry is better armed than the government? I mean, the government has all the heavy weaponry, but doesn't the citizenry have numbers on their side? Plus, can you count on the armed forces acting as an arm of the government when it comes to putting down a revolution? I think the local militarized urban police forces, just due to sheer lack of brainpower, would likely take the side of the government at first should the SHTF, but I don't anticipate small town local cops firing on their friends and neighbors, nor do I predict wide compliance should the armed forces be instructed to do so.

       I was listening to a General talk about how the military STILL feels outnumbered (and somewhat intimidated) by the armed US Republic. Americans buy more guns in 3 months than the entire Chinese military does in a year.
      </p>
      <p>
       The General talked about their wargaming for possible social collapses, and he made an enlightening admission of vulnerability. He said, "If you collect together all law enforcement in America . . . and that means every police officer, every member of the military, the intelligence community, the naval reserve, etc. . . . we have about 3 million people, total. The US population is 340 million. In the event of a nation emergency, we'd have the manpower to lock down 6 major US cities. That's it. No more."
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically, what he was expressing was a consciousness on the part of the government of how vulnerable they were. Which is why there are elements in the government [typically of a globalist, authoritarian stripe] who want to ban all guns.
      </p>
      <p>
       They're terrified of an armed populace--as only a corrupt regime is.
      </p>
      <p>
       A legitimate government never fears its own people.
      </p>
      <p>
       Only illegitimate regimes are terrified of the populace.
      </p>
      <p>
       Which is why globalists want to disarm everyone. The open desire to disarm the public is an open admission that they're illegitimate.
      </p>
      <p>
       (But history is very clear: The moment the government DOESN'T feel that vulnerability, mass-murders and gulags happen.)
      </p>
      <p>
       So, on the one hand, Americans are safe from their own (righteously nervous) government. But, on the other hand, the new "guns" are not firearms, but technology.
      </p>
      <p>
       The new disparity is a disparity in computing power.
      </p>
      <p>
       And in that sense, the technocrats enjoy an advantage over the populace that, say, Russia enjoyed with weapons in the 19th Century over its citizens.
      </p>
      <p>
       And that's where technology becomes dangerous. In the hands of the wrong people, you lose your republic and end up in a security state.
      </p>
      <p>
       Luckily, you see a grassroots pushback from hackers evening the playing field.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or places like 4Chan or Reddit where a million posters [engaging in "weaponized autism"] will be able to data mine and plow through documents in a way that the Feds can't. (They don't have the manpower.)
      </p>
      <p>
       That's our one advantage: We do.
      </p>
      <p>
       And that's why they're trying to shut down the internet and free media now: Because we now turned the tables and can "out"
       <em>
        them
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       The technocrats created this security grid to spy on us, collect our data and use it to blackmail us (if we ever reach a high enough position of influence). But we used their own technology against them. And now they're crying foul.
      </p>
      <p>
       "No fair! We were just supposed to use it on you sheep! You weren't supposed to leak my embarrassing emails all over the internet!"
      </p>

       I really like this comment. As someone that gets very anxious around someone having an open carry (or knowing people are walking around with a concealed carry,) I just worry about the idiots. I don't mind someone having an AR-15 in their home locked away, but people walking around with guns doesn't sit well with me. I worked in retail for two years a long time ago and I know how stupid people really can be. If America didn't have a mental health crisis (people not having the money for healthcare or treatment for mental disorders) I wouldn't be so weary. It's a very weird time to live in... I don't mind people having guns, but I
       <em>
        do
       </em>
       mind a guy down the street, so brainwashed and crazy, that once he got his carry permit he acted like a cowboy he saw in a movie.

       Really good points, particularly
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The open desire to disarm the public is a backhanded admission that they're illegitimate.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       What you're saying supports my hunch that the citizenry has numbers on their side. I wonder to what extent the situation has shifted from guns to info as the more important factor though. When you get right down to it, mechanical means to tear flesh probably still has the potential to cause more damage than electrical means to distribute information if and when people leave their couches with intent. I don't know, maybe the pacification is effective enough to keep that from happening.
      </p>
      <p>
       The impulse to physically disarm the citizenry still exists, so I judge the firearms to be the more pertinent threat. Yes, they're trying to control the flow of information, but they're still trying to get a hold of the guns too. I suppose it has evolved into a two-headed beast at this point. They need to decapitate both to stay in control. And they can't take out the comm lines first because it would rouse people more than letting them in place and commandeering the message.
      </p>
      <p>
       Interesting times for sure.

       This is the number 1 reason, OP.

       <p>
        Are Americans too spread out and diverse to really come together and fight a common cause?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       To an extent, yes. Europeans also have stronger national identity than Americans do. They're more homogeneous in thought.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another thing to consider along with this is that DC seems so far away. That might sound like a copout. But considering that each state roughly is equivalent of a EU nation in terms of size, GDP- in some cases population. And because the US is so massive, any given citizen is far more likely to be "removed" from the national/federal government- moreso than in a European country. It's harder to act when you feel so far away from the source of a problem. When you ARE so far away. It's like asking why we don't step in and prevent an American soldier from killing an Iraqi baby. Well, because we're not there. Why don't we protest DC? Because the vast majority of us aren't anywhere close to it. Complaining online is about as effective as publicly protesting an entity that is nowhere close to you, when you think about it. In fact, if anything it's
       <em>
        more effective
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Along with the size issue- if enough people in a EU state go on strike, it's enough to bring the country to it's knees quickly. Which means that the government is
       <em>
        forced
       </em>
       to respond in kind. In the case of America, there are 300 million of us propping up the rest of us. You need a much bigger number of people to make even a dent in the integrity of the system than in a given EU country.
      </p>
      <p>
       Finally, we can't agree what to protest on. There are too many people with too many dissenting opinions. We
       <em>
        police
       </em>
       each other to an extent. One man's grievance with Washington is another man's jingoism.

       I saw footage of the South Korean protests to out their leader and it was just sad to know that the US can't seem to organize anything like that to protest the corruption in their own country. Millions out in the streets and they got it done.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is an unspeakable evil driving the shadow government of this nation..no less evil than what that Korean leader was involved in. The outrage should overcome political divisions, apathy and distraction. It should...but..

       Do you not remember the Women's March after Trump got elected?  All those woman on the streets wearing their "pussy hats?"

       So there is outrage, but it also seems oddly fractured to me.  Why a "women's march?"  What does this specifically have to do with world politics.

       So, there is outrage, but it is fractured, and often times about identity politics bullshit.

       My war is a violent one. Maybe at one time it was and maybe violence someday will befall me. That might be my fate. But until then I can only be honest with each person I meet and help them the best I can. Sometimes I am met with situations and I fail at them (how many of you feel like shit when you see someone who could use the help but you're just too busy?) and sometimes I don't. I can't control anyone outside of myself. If people want to get together and scream and make changes then by all means do it. I'm just not that worldly. Things come and go. Kindest, kindest always stays. Always has the same effect.

       to me it is more because even though we continually get fucked over by our government, on the whole we still maintain a better quality of life and freedom than many other countries do. You arent seeing these mass protests in England, France, Germany, etc. They are in communist controlled countries. Dictator controller. Places where the average person doesnt have a $600 cell phone and a warm bed to go home to every night. With food to eat and shit to consume. They may be fucking us behind our backs, but on the surface, there are many things to be happy about living in America.

       The left never criticize or "check" their own people. They never hold their own accountable. They will make excuses and let anything slide as long as they feel like it is benefiting the message of their side.

       So, under Obama, as he is part of the left, everything he does must be OK. Many Americans truly believe Obama was a great president and didn't have any scandals.

       Our government was turned into a private wealth protection and enhancement operation soon after the end of WWII.
      </p>
      <p>
       It has taken the wealthy all of the 40 years since the assassination decade of the 60s to bring the U.S. citizen down to the level of those citizens in what was  third world emerging economies.   But they have succeeded.
      </p>
      <p>
       And during all this time, they kept you supporting the big lie, you are paying for "spreading democracy and wealth," when what really happened is you were reduced to the level of the citizens of the now   returned banana republics.
      </p>
      <p>
       No individual rights, dramatically reduced individual wealth, universal wage suppression and denial of knowledge (the anti-education operation)
      </p>
      <p>
       We are not on the streets together because they are very successful at keeping us hating each other.

       Some countries have long traditions of protest, some going back hundreds of years. One factor that contributes is that our rights come from different sources.
      </p>
      <p>
       Think about both the US and UK. Broadly speaking, Americans and Brits have the same rights. We all get to vote, we both get to speak, we have freedom of movement, etc. In a broad sense, they're the same.
      </p>
      <p>
       But it's a mistake to think we're the same "under the hood," because we walked very differing paths to get here. The sources of our rights could not be more dissimilar.
      </p>
      <p>
       Americans have rights because our system of government holds that all human beings are born with certain inalienable rights. "We hold these truths to be self-evident..."
      </p>
      <p>
       The Brits, on the other hand, are not born with many inalienable rights. They have rights only because the Queen said they could have rights.
      </p>
      <p>
       In much of the world, if you're protesting something, you're asking, "Will you give us these rights?"  Protests in the United States, on the other hand, are saying, "These rights are ours and we're not letting you take them away."

       I really like this comment. As someone that gets very anxious around someone having an open carry (or knowing people are walking around with a concealed carry,) I just worry about the idiots. I don't mind someone having an AR-15 in their home locked away, but people walking around with guns doesn't sit well with me. I worked in retail for two years a long time ago and I know how stupid people really can be. If America didn't have a mental health crisis (people not having the money for healthcare or treatment for mental disorders) I wouldn't be so weary. It's a very weird time to live in... I don't mind people having guns, but I

       mind a guy down the street, so brainwashed and crazy, that once he got his carry permit he acted like a cowboy he saw in a movie.

       What you're saying supports my hunch that the citizenry has numbers on their side. I wonder to what extent the situation has shifted from guns to info as the more important factor though. When you get right down to it, mechanical means to tear flesh probably still has the potential to cause more damage than electrical means to distribute information if and when people leave their couches with intent. I don't know, maybe the pacification is effective enough to keep that from happening.

       The impulse to physically disarm the citizenry still exists, so I judge the firearms to be the more pertinent threat. Yes, they're trying to control the flow of information, but they're still trying to get a hold of the guns too. I suppose it has evolved into a two-headed beast at this point. They need to decapitate both to stay in control. And they can't take out the comm lines first because it would rouse people more than letting them in place and commandeering the message.

       Interesting times for sure.
