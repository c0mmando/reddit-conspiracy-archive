       I just read on sputniknews (sorry, the source is not in English, that's why I don't share the link) that
       <em>
        American soldiers based in and around Seoul have started evacuating their families as well as civilian staff. Family members of diplomats and of the US embassy staff are also leaving. Reports of evacuation appeared on social media and on public servers of the 2nd infantry division and of the 8th US army based in Seoul.
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        According to Konstantin Asmolov, a Russian expert on Korea, this shows the threat of an upcoming conflict.
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        Tokyo is considering emergency measure to evacuate their 60 000 Japanese citizens living in South Korea.
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        Local media ask not to panic, and reminds that South Korea is opposed to any military conflict with North Korea.
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       This is not good.

      <p>
       I couldn't find any other sources that would confirm this.

       Well, the article is over a day old. I don't see any mentions of US evacuations on Twitter. You'd think someone would have tweeted something, even if based just on this article. So the fact that there are no mentions is a little suspicious, but maybe no one reads French Sputnik.
      </p>
      <p>
       Twitter does mention talk of a Japanese evacuation. I see a tweet from April 13 that says the US military was practicing evacuation drills in South Korea, though it's not clear if that was a general population evacuation or a US evacuation.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's possible someone confused mentions of the mock-evac drills with a real evacuation. It's also possible they really are evacuating. I. Have. No. Idea.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think the US might evacuate even if they had no intentions of attacking, to help the DPRK to take the threat of attack seriously. But that escalates this and could spurn DPRK to take the first blow. And I don't see Trump backing down, tbh. For as much as he's mocked Obama for letting Assad cross a line without consequences, I think he believes it's essential to back up threats otherwise no future threat will be successful at avoiding war. But, there's been no threat here--it'd also be normal to evacuate only because tensions are rising.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know what to make of this. Something to keep an eye on, that's for sure. Definitely interesting.

       It's an evacuation of the families of those with high positions. When the captain leaves the boat, what does that tell you about the boat's fate ? It's certainly not an evacuation of the whole population. A global panic is the last thing local authorities want. That's why they ask in the local media not to panic, and reiterate that SK is opposed to any military conflict with NK.

       Adherence to strict op-sec would be paramount in something like this though. Taking about any kind of movement is a no-no. I've seen a guy get njp'd for posting "helsinki is the tits, next stop estonia!" on his facebook page.

       Oh, sure, I agree. That's what I was getting at with the "little suspicious" part. We know from this article that word leaked out via the family members' facebook or whatever. That's the reporter's stated source. This article was published. Nearly 2 full days have passed, and
       <em>
        no one
       </em>
       has mentioned the article on Twitter?
       <a href="/u/calliflower">
        /u/calliflower
       </a>
       says the article has 35,000 views, so it can't be that no one saw the article. I don't want to hop on the path to crazy town &amp; allege that the government is censoring Twitter or anything, but I'd think that if 35k people saw this at least one would have tweeted about it, ya know?

       Oh sorry, im not implying that the government is actively suppressing twitter feeds when i say op-sec. "Practicing good op-sec" is its own thing really stressed to soldiers/sailors and their families. Like saying "hey dont actively discuss any type of movement on social media." Its a "self-disciplined" thing, so the only way you would hear about it on twitter, is if someone willingly broke op-sec

       US military personnel began evacuating their families and civilian base personnel near Seoul. In addition, family members of diplomats and staff of the US embassy also leave the South Korean capital. Russian experts see this as a clear sign of a threat of conflict.
      </p>
      <p>
       Members of US military families began to leave the capital of South Korea hurriedly. Although the Pentagon did not formally confirm this information, evacuation reports appeared on the social networks and public servers of the 2nd Infantry Division and the 8th US Army stationed in South Korea. Moreover, according to unconfirmed information, families of American diplomats would leave Seoul.
      </p>
      <p>
       According to Konstantin Asmolov, a Russian expert from Korea, this evacuation testifies to the threat of conflict.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "The behavior of the Americans means that they do not hope to destroy North Korea's nuclear installations with impunity. They understand that North Korea will respond to these attacks. In addition, in the center of Seoul there is a crowded area of ​​American troops, "Konstantin Asmolov said in an interview with Izvestia.
       </p>

       While local media exhorts not to panic, adding that South Korea is firmly opposed to any military action against Pyongyang, Tokyo is considering emergency measures to evacuate the 60,000 Japanese citizens residing in Korea from South.
      </p>
      <p>
       Formally, the United States and North Korea are in a state of war. Indeed, the conflict of 1950-1953 in Korea had ended only with the signing of an armistice. The United States refused to discuss Pyongyang's multiple proposals to sign a peace deal, keeping more than 28,000 US troops in South Korea on the pretext of defending the country against the "threat of the North".
      </p>
      <p>
       To increase their deterrence against North Korea, the United States is considering deploying three aircraft carriers off the Korean peninsula: USS Carl Vinson, USS Ronald Reagan and USS Nimitz.
      </p>
      <p>
       North Korea, for its part, invokes the American threat and develops a nuclear and ballistic program, despite the ban of the Security Council of the UN.

       I need to ask my friend about this. He's been there for a year and he only had less than a month left. I don't want him to be in a war right when he's about to come home.

       Well, the article is over a day old. I don't see any mentions of US evacuations on Twitter. You'd think someone would have tweeted something, even if based just on this article. Twitter does mention talk of a Japanese evacuation. I do see a tweet from April 13 that says the US military was practicing evacuation drills in South Korea, though it's not clear if that was a general population evacuation or a US evacuation.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's possible someone confused mentions of the mock-evac drills with a real evacuation. It's also possible they really are evacuating.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think the US might evacuate even if they had no intentions of attacking, to help the DPRK to take the threat of attack seriously. But even that move would raise tensions and could spurn DPRK to take the first blow. And I don't see Trump backing down, tbh. For as much as he's mocked Obama for letting Assad cross a line without consequences, I think he believes it's essential to back up threats otherwise no future threat will be successful at avoiding war.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know what to make of this. Something to keep an eye on, that's for sure. Definitely interesting.

       Americans leaving the area was the sign I read to look for, for actual combat threats. I hope this is nothing but this is a bit worrying.

       Oh sorry, im not implying that the government is actively suppressing twitter feeds when i say op-sec. "Practicing good op-sec" is its own thing really stressed to soldiers/sailors and their families. Like saying "hey dont actively discuss any type of movement on social media." Its a "self-disciplined" thing, so the only way you would hear about it on twitter, is if someone willingly broke op-sec
