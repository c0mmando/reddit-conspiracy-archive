        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">73</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2017-04-22 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/RebelliousSkoundrel.html">RebelliousSkoundrel</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>What became the United States defense contractor DynCorp International began in 1946 as California Eastern Airways (CEA), an air freight business, and Land-Air Inc., in aircraft maintenance company founded by veterans of World War II. In 1962 CEA became “Dynalectron Corporation”. By 1986, Dynaelectron was one of the largest defense contractors in North America. In 1987, Dynalectron changed its name to DynCorp and subsequently became a privately traded corporation in 1988. In 2003 DynCorp officially became “DynCorp International”.</p>

<p>At about the same time DynCorp began involving itself in criminal activities perpetrated by the United States government and its rising military-industrial complex. This book’s content begins in the 1980s when DynCorp began its work trafficking drugs and weapons during the Iran-Contra Scandal. It takes the reader through the 1990s human trafficking scandals in the Balkans, through the 2000s human and organ trafficking scandals, and additional major criminal activities leading up to 2017.</p>

<p>Originally I wrote this as a 10-part blog series also titled The Case Against DynCorp, followed by a podcast, all of which can be found on my Steemit blog. This book, however, contains further refinements, edits, elaborations and formatting intended to make it better suited for print and mass publication as a book.</p>

<p>The information contained in these pages is of the <strong>utmost importance</strong>. It outlines a criminal enterprise conducted by one of the <strong>most prolific</strong> and <strong>well-resourced military corporations</strong> in the entire <strong>world</strong>. DynCorp International represents a threat to <strong>everyone</strong>, whether they are from the United States or not. Worst of all, DynCorp represents a particularly dangerous threat to <strong>children</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>No DynCorp employee has ever been criminally prosecuted for any of these crimes.</strong> While most recently in April of 2017 the Vice President of Business Development for DynCorp, James Grazioplene, was arrested for molesting children in the 1980s, this was during his term as an officer in the United States Army. </p>

<p>With that said, <strong>do not take this as a personal attack</strong> on all employees of DynCorp International and persons in the public or private armed protection services. I do, however, stand by my general theory that <strong>privatizing military and intelligence agencies leads to disastrous results</strong>. On a personal level <strong>I would prefer to live in a world where</strong> military corporations such as <strong>DynCorp didn’t have to exist</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>The purpose of this book is to inform</strong> and properly <strong>equip the reader with facts</strong>, sources, perspectives and materials for <strong>founding their own argument</strong>. In addition, it is to <strong>memorialize the victims</strong> who have gone without a voice or justice for so long.</p>

<p>Lol. It&#39;s a book about a 4chan trolling campaign that got turned into the new birther movement. It&#39;s no where near important</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do you think the woman who is presented to be his mother, is not actually his mother? I have generally ignored the whole birther thing, from the perspective that I don&#39;t care if he was born on Mars, or any place on earth, he came out of an American vagina. That makes him an American. It does not make him a good president, but I&#39;ve always seen the birther movement as a distraction, a fight that couldn&#39;t be won. Obama was a bad president because of the corporate interests he immediately sold out too,  filled his cabinet with, and took money from. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, that&#39;s not what I think. But do you understand the difference between &quot;natural born citizen&quot; and &quot;citizen&quot;? The issue is interpretation of the constitution.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Both are important IMO. Truth is always important. In this case, non-natural born presidential candidates are becoming a more common occurrence (Marco Rubio, Ted Cruz specifically, both naturalized via 14th amendment, NOT natural by birth). They will likely use Obama&#39;s presidency as precedent for &quot;internationalizing&quot; the executive branch. But Trump will not investigate this issue, I think that&#39;s fairly clear. Nobody with any legal clout will. They won&#39;t even go after Hillary. Or can&#39;t. The legal system engages in castigation and character assassination of anyone who questions the &quot;taboo.&quot; It will always be the case.</p>
