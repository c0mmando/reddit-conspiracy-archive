       It's also been said that he's going to run for governor, perhaps as a prelude to running for President further on down the road.

       Definitely a better job and all in his home state than contending with being a congressman in DC and that his work as a congressman up to now certainly wouldn't hurt his chances of winning.
      </p>

       It may very well be no more than that and the kind of time and timing it would take to prepare for and seize that opportunity.

       Well, he said it's to spend more time with his family, so we know that's not not it.

       While I'm pretty suspicious of the Russia hysteria being whipped up by establishment Dems to distract from their own electoral failures, one thing is pretty clear: Donald Trump is owned. Be it by Russian oligarchs, the mob or Deutsche Bank it doesn't really matter.  Someone bailed his ass out after his (numerous) business failures.  Sooner or later that shit (or worse) is getting out.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whatever it is that comes out, you don't want to be the Republican in charge of government oversight.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you fuck your party now by investigating and releasing info? Good luck with that Republican Governor's​ primary in UTAH.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or do you cover it up and go down with the ship? Again, good luck in that Governor's race.

       There are rumors that he's being blackmailed with an affair, which makes sense of the weird tweets he posted about how much he loves his wife right as he was announcing it.  Like she might leave him and he was doing damage control.  It also makes sense why Pedosta was taunting him.  Blackmail
