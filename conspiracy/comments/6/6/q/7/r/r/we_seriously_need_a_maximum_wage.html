       Honestly, as horrific as this may sound to you future billionaires (dreamers), we need a maximum wage of 25 million NET per year. We also need a simplified tax system so people can't cheat but pay a fair wage all around.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mentioned this months back and one person was complaining because they made a lot of money with a gigantic overhead but they were missing the point. Net income is what's left at the end of the year after all the overhead expenses so if someone makes 1 billion and has 1 billion worth of expenses, then they made $0 net this year and should not pay any taxes. I'm just using this as a simple example.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is absolutely no reason or any good that can come out of people making over 25 million a year. That's over 2 million dollars a month and plenty for anyone.
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem is that these money worshippers are pulling in billions (sometimes trillions in gross revenue) and fucking up the whole economy. There is absolutely no good that comes from making over 25 million a year. Some might say that these people are opening up new locations (ie a new walmart) and that is true but they are also monopolizing the industry they are in instead of letting an up and coming businessman to invest into the market and create his own company that competes with the billionaires somehow (ie a new social network to compete with facebook).
      </p>
      <p>
       Without an income cap, the thilthy rich who are also in bed with the cabal just keep extracting and extracting from the world economies without end and that is why we keep running into problems that lead to a worst quality of life for all.
      </p>
      <p>
       Before walmart took over every hot spot across the country, there were many, many ma and pa stores that were doing fairly well but they are mostly shut down now leading to a middle class fallout.
      </p>
      <p>
       But, the problem is these rich companies have become so powerful that they are controlling the economic rules to benefit themselves. Still, its a good thing to keep in mind so that we can one day make some adjustments to crush this unfair system and stimulate the economy.
      </p>
      <p>
       (Also, any excess money past 25 million should be utilized into something important like infrastructure or education to further build the country instead of wrecking it now).
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT:
      </p>
      <p>
       In all seriousness, MONEY is the problem. It was a good system to help evolve us back in the day, but it has lost its functionality due to nonstop looting. Any system (capitalism, socialism, communism) that uses money is going to end up failing as they always have.
      </p>
      <p>
       The ONLY solution I know of is to get off our dependency of money. We don't need it and there is a system that was created called SACRED ECONOMICS that will automatically take us all out of debt and level the playing field so that humanity moves up and down together (and we can move way, way up!).
      </p>
      <p>
       See 12 minute video explaining Sacred Economics here:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEZkQv25uEs">
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEZkQv25uEs
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit 2: Communism and socialism are gimmicks to enrich the top 1% just like capatalism is but in a unique way. Whenever money is involved, the 1% of those who hold power win. The 1% can move the market at will but they keep it at a barely functioning level for power and control reasons. If we get off the usage of money, we drain them of power. That is why I was recommending sacred economics. It doesn't use money and seems like the most lucrative option.

       Regarding your point at large, I think you are better off fixing 'maximum ownership', and then perhaps democracy in general. But to your point, I fully agree with setting a maximum wage, though I feel it's ultimately patch fixing.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the end, governments support and serve the financial, or currency system. Regardless of 'feelings', those with more currency will ALWAYS have more say in government. Regarding a 'grown persons abilities', it is debatable whether or not their amount of growth should be limited, or though it is widely agreed that the base level humans should not fall below X on a standardized basis.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example, it is speculated that when humans fall below the amount of money necessary to sustain life, that they will become violent and break the governmental contracts, rather than passively die.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now here's the Rub, the same Rub Thomas Paine fought for back in 1776, with the Rights of Man. Should any child be BORN with an extreme ownership of society or currency units? In 1776, this was clearly referring to the King, but literally applies to all children.
      </p>
      <p>
       Today you have situations where some children are BORN into a situation where they possess extreme societal ownership ON BIRTH. Some are born owning more than 10% of future societal output. Is that fair? What would be your rule and regulation for that?
      </p>
      <p>
       So what I think is a better system is to set a 'maximum societal ownership percentage', and to make the information publicly available. After all, everyone paying taxes and voting within America is ultimately contributing to the American distribution of funds and ownership. Don't you think it would be good to know for whom you serve?
      </p>
      <p>
       I loosely suggest that no single individual in America should possess more than 1 of 1,000% of societal ownership. This could be interpreted as $16 Billion. In terms of redistribution, I would be even initially content if Bill Gates and Buffet were able to redistribute the money as they please, just so long as, at the end of the year, every year, no individual was allowed to possess greater than 1 of 1,000% of societal ownership.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example, $100,000 in savings represents about 1 in 160,000% of ownership, and I think the average American has about $25,000 in savings.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fixing the bottom has more to do with education, motivation, and discipline, but fixing those at the top will always require the application of law and morality.

       My father hit the 25mil mark you seem to have put a lot if thought into. My father donates money to charity and has his hobby of breeding thoroughbred race horses. This sounds so much like that secret cabal we all fear huh? Literally what your plan is is hindering someones financial freedom because they may have more drive than the average joe shmoe and if you are the average joe, get better, quit complaining because it looks like someone complaining because they lack what other have worked hard to gain for themselves.

       You don't understand what's happening here. I'm glad your dad is doing great but 25 million a year is fanatastic. Who needs more money than that? The problem is that the more they absorb cash from the economy, the worst the economy gets. Cash is supposed to change hands non-stop. It needs to always be spent while some is saved but when people like Facebook are saving tens of billions in a bank that doesn't benefit anyone except for the billionaire banks, we have a problem.

       Oh wow and look at those numbers... Facebook tens of billions is totally comparable to 25 mil accumulated over a career. Thanks for reminding me of the scope of people I'm arguing with. No wonder 9/11 still isnt taken seriously with logic like this "large corporations with billions are fucking us so that means every wealthy person is fucking us raaaawwwrrr"

       While i was no math wizard... 10billion &gt; 25mil.... Like 400 times over no?

       If corporations take advantage of people's drive, I see nothing wrong with the people as a democracy taking advantage of the drive of multimillionaires and billionaires.  They will still have more than everyone else, they can still feed their pathetic egos.

       I'm sure there are negatives but Bill Gates seems to be doing good with his money.
      </p>
      <p>
       I get what you're saying and yes, unused to be one of those embarrassed millionaires who was just working my way up. As I've aged I don't care to sacrifice my time with family and friends to run in the wheel. I make good money but I'm content where I'm at.

      <p>
       If we limit income where does the excess go?
      </p>
      <p>
       Most income earned by top .1% is not W2 income, it's investment income. Which is taxed 15% flat rate currently (I think)

       I've come around to the idea of UBI, population is growing and efficiency is increasing. That is not sustainable.  I'd say rather than cap income,  retard wealth growth and hoarding. If a billionaire spent  most of their money every year it's not a problem. The money is going back into the economy, the problem is it is being pooled and never gets back out.
      </p>
      <p>
       Other thing we need to be aware of is the very rich are not loyal to the country as much. They can leave if the environment becomes too hostile to them. It's a delicate balance.

       Limiting the amount you can earn won't increase the distribution of wealth. Instead of earning, say 100million a year, now that CEO and his 3 brothers earn 25 million a year. That's an oversimplification of the many ways in which this won't change anything.

       That's ok. Let him get 4 of his siblings to make 25 million a year in various companies. That would still help. The family can make 125 million a year through 5 companies.

       The idea is to create a system that even when abused, will still perform pretty well. 125 million a year is way better than 25 billion a year like many companies are doing right now. Hell, BofA is a 3 TRILLION dollar company right now.

       Well, you might think Google has "earned" making million of dollars per minute, but to me, that is unfair. Great. Google is great but that doesn't give them the right to harvest all the money out of our economy because it left the rest of us in shambles.
      </p>
      <p>
       Simply put, we need a limit because without limits we will all suffer in the end. There's no stopping monster companies without an income cap. They will just keep sucking money out like a vacuum.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm glad you are trying to protect the rights of the 1% but you can't ignore the other 99% because the way the system is setup, it fucks the 99% over. Its broken. We need income caps. Fuck greed. We need functionality.

       First of all, a company is not an individual. First you want to cap the personal worth of individuals, and now you are claiming you want to cap how much businesses can take in. I think we should have anti-monopoly and collusions laws on the books, but that isn't what you're arguing for, you're arguing for wealth limits.

       I really can't express how stupid I think you are without getting banned. Do you want to see all the businesses that made this country into the most economically prosperous nation in the history of humanity disappear? Do you want to become a large scale version of Cuba or Venezuela? What you're advocating for is exactly how you do it which is why the philosophy used to found this nation is the exact opposite of what you're espousing in these comments.

       Positive sum games can still have both winners and losers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Looking at the ultra wealth it is pretty clear to me that they frequently acquire wealth at the expense of others. Just look at the '08 crash. They knew they were selling bogus CDOs but did anyway, thereby accumulating wealth that represented no real value. Then when the crash happened they secured taxpayer bailout money so that they retained their jobs/companies/wealth while old Joe down the street lost his house to a bank.
      </p>
      <p>
       Underneath all of this there is a healthy economy where people are producing value, so as you say it isn't a zero sum game. We have a lot of people producing new wealth all around the world. But when the ultra wealthy play games by selling bogus CDOs, manipulating stock prices, etc, they are generally taking wealth from someone else. That is why wealth inequality continues to grow at astounding rates.

       I definitely agree that a maximum wage isn't a great idea. Create a maximum wage and the wealthy will just create companies for themselves instead so that their income is not a wage (they already do this for taxes). And in the meantime you've given the government even more power by giving them greater control of wealth. I don't see how anything good could come out of that.

       It's a method of preventing insurrection. People won't revolt if they

       they're already free. 
People won't question the economic system if they think it offers them the same opportunities as everyone else (it doesn't).

       Because I'm sure everyone on here complaining is good with money and has an understanding of how the wealthy handles their finances. 😒 you can donate money to causes and still net a profit with other ventures. Go and continue on with your robin hood pipe dream. Its a shitty idea and plenty more will agree.

        this has been shown not to work (see Ben and Jerry's example). I sympathize with the sentiment, but the only way to eliminate the monopolistic and cartelistic aberrations of today's system is to abolish any government-corporate collaboration. the best way to start this is to abolish the federal reserve, believe it or not.

       my interpretation is different. they simply could not attract competent CEOs who would maximize the companies profits. hence, they kept increasing the ratio, until they scrapped it completely. if it was made into law, B&amp;J would simply have gone out of business, or decline as a company.

       I really think this sub (and people in general) could use some reading in basic economics. the false song of globalism is paved with socialism (which benefits the rich and powerful) but people don't seem to get this unfortunately.

       any normal person goes for the highest reward. and sure, there are other factors at play, but obviously ceteris paribus everyone prefers to earn more than to earn less.

       first of all, CEOs aren't some super capable smart people, they are flexible, adaptable and can exploit the environment to their needs. this doesn't make them super smart.
      </p>

       what i mean was scientists, pepole who create and invent stuff and drive the progress forward. CEOs don't do that, they're just a leach in a system designed for a few %.

       I never said they were. CEOs' job is to make decisions. those decisions will either increase or decrease a company's value. if their decisions decrease the value, then they will be sacked (unless they are in companies protected by government, as happens rampantly today). but making decisions is necessary in any situation, be it a family or a company. they are not leeching if the shareholders decide they are doing a good job and want to pay them to make those decisions.

       yes ok i see your point, but if we assume communism in this scenario, the statement, capable people will not work because wages too low is false, because as i said, capable people work and invent because they can.
      </p>
      <p>
       it's like a, even in capitalism, saying, i have an idea, very good idea for a product that will make me rich, but the taxes are too high, so I won't do it. because, you know, 20% is too much or whatever ... but if it was 10% i would make this and be rich.
      </p>
      <p>
       nobody ever said that, and taxes do not influence the smart, capable people. they do stuff becaue they can and no amount of wages will change that.

       actually, funny that you mention it, I started a company and closed it after a year and half because the reward was just not worth it (too much hassle, not enough payoff). went back to work for a multinational.
      </p>
      <p>
       there are studies about this as well. high taxes and regulations benefit big companies because they have enough money to pay people to go through the hassle, comply with all the regulations and still make profits. small entrepreneurs have a much harder time and some of them (like me) quit after a while cause it's just not worth it. of course, some people will have a sense of duty to do whatever it is they want to do, but some will simply fall back to a safer and more rewarding 9-6 job, which I did cause I would rather not have the hassle and get more money.
      </p>
      <p>
       high taxes and regs also promote the black market.

       This is similar to what Mélenchon (French president candidate is proposing), but much more severe: 100% tax on all personal earnings over €400k.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I think it has a major flaw: the €400-€1mil/year is for very specialized employees, rare scientists or doctors, extreme high risk oil/fire workers, etc. Second, it cuts into the value of stock options, which start-ups need to convince smart people to not work for big rich tech companies. If you cap those income ranges, you might reduce the number of people who do those jobs.
      </p>
      <p>
       Above €1mil/year, people can easily redirect income overseas and avoid incurring the tax. You may be able to limit it if you can closely track money made and distributed within the country, but that would be the extent. Not to mention, it encourages companies to move their headquarters out of the country, so they can pay their execs what the execs demand.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ultimately, it is all a market force. Taxation can work when the market is inelastic, people have to do the business no matter how high the tax is. But if it's easy to leave, an elastic market, then they will leave.

       The tax system is bunk. Basically once you hit like $115K or $125 K (forget which) you no longer gettaxed on some things above that point.
      </p>
      <p>
       So if you make $200k a year, you only pay all the taxes on like 115k of it.. that's wack. Poorer people get taxed on all their earnings. Richer folks don't. And then the whole more you have you can do trading etc to avoid can near all taxation. It is a jacked up system catered to the extremely wealthy.

       I actually only found out about this, this year because I actually went in to talk to my tax person on account of some income changes, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       "For 2017, the maximum amount of taxable earnings for Social Security and Medicare is $127,500. In other words, an employee must pay 6.2% of any income up to $127,500 for 2017 = $7,905. But any dollar you make above $127,500 is free of the Social Security tax" - See more at:
       <a href="http://www.financialsamurai.com/maximum-taxable-income-amount-for-social-security-fica/">
        http://www.financialsamurai.com/maximum-taxable-income-amount-for-social-security-fica/
       </a>
       "
      </p>
      <p>
       It changes each year and there are other technical things to look at, but yeah after a certain amount that you make, you no longer pay social security or medicare on the rest of your earnings.

       How would this help anything? Anyone who would get taxed unreasonably would have the means to disguise their income through various methods.
      </p>
      <p>
       No, the free market is the best method. And the free market works best when people are informed and consumers are conscious and have principles (i.e. not paying $850 for a new iPhone... or any money at all).

       Second that. As a progressive, I don't want to fight another straw man that makes it easier to paint us as if we hate success.
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem is that the tax system we have now, with all its loopholes is likely not even progressive as a whole, except for the middle class.
      </p>
      <p>
       Simply eliminating loopholes, and taxing all income as regular income, so that everyone pays taxes on the same progressive scale
       <em>
        we already have
       </em>
       , and middle class is subject to, would be a huge change.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can even frame it as lowering the taxes for the middle and lower classes. If you increase tax revenue from taxes collected due to closing of the loopholes, you can lower the taxes for those who did not get the chance to use those loopholes by the equal amount.

       Our current (American) system is actually based on the amalgamation of ideas created by western philosophers over thousands of years which were selectively included by the founding fathers in the structure of our government. In those thousands of years the western world, not just the U.S., has flourished and has created the highest levels of quality of life compared to any other region of the world, in the entire history of the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       Have some gratitude for the profoundness and success of these ideas instead of wanting to rip out the philosophical foundation of the western world because you have a personal problem with the skin color and biological sex of the creators of this foundation.

Obviously it's more complex than just that, but the fact remains that the vast majority of the wealth created is being hoarded by a handful of people.

       I also already stated that it's not the entire problem. Do you have poor reading comprehension? You're right though; those with money and power practice aspects of socialism for themselves. Socialism for the rich, capitalism for the poor. This is why we have a crony capitalistic system.

       $100 billion annually is given to the non-working poor through entitlement programs. $900 billion annually is given to working poor through entitlement programs. That doesn't even include medicare or social security. That's not capitalism.

       The rich act very different from the vast masses living in the U.S. I mentioned those with money and power practicing aspects of socialism, but the government isn't "giving" it to them. They hoard the wealth all for themselves with the help of our corrupt politicians, which is a significant factor in our crony capitalistic system.

       Which is it dude? You can't have both. It's corruption, we both agree. The two parties benefitting from this corruption are politicians and corporations. A mutually beneficial relationship, one giving favors to the other.

       The 3/5ths rule was also introduced early on. It gave slave owners an extra 3/5ths of a vote. So if a property owner also owned slaves, they got more than one vote.

       There's probably a reason for that too.  Plantations that produce crops  or food are more important and more valuable.  How do you represent that?  Probably the 3/5ths vote per slave would make more important properties have better representation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Under that system, you wouldn't want someone that lives in the city with a small dwelling and producing nothing to be equal to a plantation that provides food for the city.

       IIRC, that was the justification for it. Southerners wanted the numbers of representatives, etc. to reflect the actual population of the South, but people weren't willing to let a slave count as an entire person. The South had to concede that, because they weren't actually letting the slaves vote or anything. It basically just gave Southern states more representatives.

       There is this thing called human nature (actually it's just economics of the resources needed to live driving the primal animal urges of our brains) that basically prevents the idealized version of communism from ever existing.  Just like how an idealized version of capitalism can't exist.

       All states control the distribution of wealth when it sets up rules. Capitalist states simply prioritize increasing the wealth of those with capital.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is no such thing as a "free market" where wealth is magically distributed to people based on market forces that sound a lot like the concept of God. All systems involve setting up rules and therefore distributing wealth to winners and losers.

       Marx said numerous times there has to be a world-wide communist revolution implemented relatively simultaneously.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        "Empirically communism is only possible as the act of dominant peoples 'all at once' and simultaneously, which presupposes the universal development of productive forces and the world intercourse bound up with communism."
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       "In all revolutions up until now the mod off activity always remained unscathed and it was only a question of a different distribution of this activity, a new distribution of labor to other persons,
       <strong>
        while the communist revolution is directed against the preceding mode of activity, does away with labour, and abolishes the rule of all classes with the classes themselves
       </strong>
       , because it is carried through by the class which no longer counts as a class in society, is not recognized as a class, and is in itself the expression of the dissolution of all classes, nationalities, etc within present society."

      <p>
       Both quotes are from
       <em>

       Yeah, your quotes aren't doing you any favors.  Where does it say something is to be implemented?  Communism is a revolutionary movement, see here:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Communism is for us not a state of affairs which is to be established, an ideal to which reality [will] have to adjust itself. We call communism the real movement which abolishes the present state of things. The conditions of this movement result from the premises now in existence.

       Marx, literally saying that the movement must abolish the status quo. So if you were to ask again how is this an implementation, it says right here you have to implement it by destroying the current society.

       I think there is a breakdown of language here.  When I say not something to be implemented, I mean there is no one platform of communism to be implemented.  We dont know the exact form post capitalist society will take, because we don't know the material conditions.

       The communist movement will come just like all of the other movements before it, changes in material conditions which lead to changes in the relationship to production.  You don't just say, hey all means of production are socially controlled, just like the capitalism didn't emerge from feudal society by simple declarations.  The movement is a bottom up movement, not something implemented from the top down(here we are again).

      <p>
       Yes, our relations with men, production, and society will be much different than it is now.  Our material conditions determine man's thought, just as the tendencies we all have today, differ from the tendencies of men before us.  This is basic historical materialism, for a better understanding I would recommend chapter 1 of The German Ideology.   The citation needed was the eternal human nature you speak of that cannot exist with communism.

       So you're fine with all the Hillary Clinton (has been gone for 6 months) "lock her up" posts and the John Podesta pizzagate emails, but talking about a global conspiracy by the wealthy to horde wealth and possible solutions to it is a bridge too far?

       Sorry but that's a strawman. If the elite are doing things that are illegal I have no problem with them facing consequences. I want them too. However, if you want to take wealth away from someone strictly because they have more wealth than the arbitrary limit you've set for them, that's what I have a problem with.

       So why don't you argue your points instead of trying to shut the post down?  Sidebar- Conspiracy: a secret plan by a group to do something unlawful or harmful.  I'd say there is LITTLE doubt that wealth inequality fits the description of harmful.  I don't know that this solution works at all and I'm more of the mind of helping others than I am hindering people.  It's a twisted cycle, though and I should know because I've been a part of it:  "Go do market research surveys against competitors and don't come back to me until you come back with something that justifies a raise for the CEO to the board." (and hopefully when my review comes around I'll get a nice perk for inflating their wealth further)

       Fair enough.  I felt the conspiracy of bankers and businesspeople is implied here, but I don't think it's a straw man to say that there are countless other topics on this sub that are nothing but a political circle jerk.  At least this one is somewhat productive/interesting.

       Wikileaks never said anything about Pizzagate.  They distributed the emails and that was it (which is what they do though the timing was very suspect).  I highly recommend reading the emails directly and without another person interpreting them for you.
       <br/>
       Of course this was about the double standard that is being applied in r/conspiracy on the whole and really not so much to do with WL.

       I love it when people point out that the far left is authoritarian, as if it wasn't inherently obvious to anyone with an ounce of common sense that going too far in either direction leads to despotism.
      </p>
      <p>
       But no, I'm sure that the far right have no hands at all in politicizing institutions or being full of shit and hypocrisy.

       Why is it that when someone claims something is inherently socialist/Marxist/communist that they have no idea what any of those ideas are?

       How is a maximum wage marxist exactly?

      <p>
       People don't get equal portions in capitalist society, neither would people under a maximum wage society...

      <p>
       But the numbers would actually make sense for once, and not trillions made regularly in funny money simply because there isn't enough to pay bonuses to bankers and wallstreet cocksuckers.

       Not sure this would attain what you hope, all that would happen is the  maximum wage/income would become the new badge of elitism. The majority would still get to wear a badge of shit.

       Oh ya, anything over 25 million could go to the universal basic income pool which is later distributed but I don't trust the government. They will probably steal a lot of that money and give it back to the rich. We also need open source government.

       There are a lot of things that could destroy the elites power overnight. It's mostly just too much change. I think it's because we are at a slightly, but significantly higher frequency of consciousness. A lot of things have contributed to it, the main one being the Internet imo. We're seeing a level of potential democracy never seen before and there are many factions fighting for what's left of the power.

       Ya but you can keep reinvesting into your own business but eventually that investment would have to stop. Once your company is maxed out, then all that extra money goes to something like feeding the homeless or whatever. In reality, money itself is the problem. It overcomplicates things.

       Basically, a company can expand all they want but anything made over 25 million has to be donated or whatever. They can expand all the time but eventually that company will make a fortune (ie 250 billion) and that extra income has to go to whatever we deem. What is the point of continuous expansion when the money won't be seen outside of 25 million a year?

       This is actually very generous, that leftist in France wants to tax income over 430k 100%. What it comes down to is an ethical battle; is it ethical to "punish" the very successful/"limit" personal liberty vs. Is it ethical to let the very successful dominate the economy and the political scene to their exclusive benefit, socialism for the rich, rugged individualism for the 99%. Then you get into private property, assets, stocks, upper distribution of wealth, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Acknowledging reality and the current, pressing needs of the masses to not only survive but have a chance to be self-sufficient in this world should wipe out the "liberty" based concerns (but of course I would say this, I'm a leftist myself. Just as someone on the right would say "this isn't about ideology it's about what's good and real and truly free.") The back and forth lasts forever-- but clearly, here in America, the system maintains and is only getting worse for the vast majority of workers and citizens. Trump is a mascot for this decline.

       this has been shown not to work (see Ben and Jerry's example). I sympathize with the sentiment, but the only way to eliminate the monopolistic and cartelistic aberrations of today's system is to abolish any government-corporate collaboration. the best way to start this is to abolish the federal reserve, believe it or not.

       And you don't think his money is going back into the economy throw him purchasing stables feed or anything else for the horse hobby, what about paying the jockeys and trainers? Clear cut case of people who underachieved complaining about those who achieved more. You also fail to look at other things that fuck our economy like government assistance the drug war and the black budget. But nope its definitely those business owners who worked their asses off. Its their fault others are poor 😑

       Go take a reading comprehension class. Over the course of his career accumulated over 25 mil. Average of 5 mil a year yes but all while living on the budget of a 100k household. No lambos. All leases and basic models. Like I said before and say again. Keep on building up and fighting this strawman. Maybe go try and make money instead of worrying about who has more than you and how you can take what they earned?

       Why should we punish the successful by implementing a cap on income or net revenue?

       Taxation is Theft anyway. Imagine for a second if you will... If you make $11/hr and work 160hrs/month, you will make $1,760/month. Of that $1,760/month you will pay almost $400 in taxes. Imagine how much better off we'd all be if we weren't paying taxes. I'd be able to afford a BRAND NEW car with that extra $400/month.

       I could almost agree with you, except for one thing: human nature.
      </p>
      <p>
       First it starts off at a high arbitrary level.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then the government decides to lower that level just a bit, but it's ok.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then they keep lowering it, and lowering it until instead of 25 million, you have 25,000.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just like the income tax was only supposed to be for high earners then everyone ended up with it, what would stop the same thing from happening here?
      </p>
      <p>
       Further, if I am acting in accordance to the law and have made my money legally, who are you to decide to put a cap on it?
      </p>
      <p>
       Finally, what is to stop a multi-national company from moving their headquarters to country that does not have an income cap? Now you have fucked over the businesses in your own country, and have given incentive for other companies looking to attract CEO/Board talent to take them to the next level to do the same.

       Max wage cap will not do anyting *( except make the rich richer )
       <br/>
       Most rich poeple do not work.
       <br/>
       This cap would just reduce the amount of money a worker can make.
       <br/>
       And make the rich yet richer.
       <br/>
       An income cap could be posible ( can not have more as x income a year )
       <br/>
       But then who would Start projects like Space x  ?
       <br/>
       We all croud fund it ?
       <br/>
       Or will we be dependent on the government to start expansive projects ?

       FairTax solves all tax issues.
      </p>
      <p>
       Flat consumption tax of 20%, and everyone, Bill Gates to the homeless, gets a rebate up to the poverty line.  So if the poverty line is $35k, you get a yearly check from the government for $7k(35k*.2).
      </p>
      <p>
       It's fair to all, provides a form of universal basic income, promotes savings and investment, and you can't skirt it.

       Maximum wage is extremely dumb, just make sure great wealth only comes from providing great value.

       The rich would still be able to dodge this tax because they don't make their wealth from "wages." The mega rich accrue their fortunes through "Asset Appreciation."
      </p>
      <p>
       For example look at Bill Gates. He never was paid billions of dollars in wages. He simply owned a large portion of Microsoft which in the beginning was hardly worth anything. Then as Microsoft grew into a multi-billion dollar corporation Bill Gates suddenly found himself a billionaire. It is virtually impossible to prevent this kind of thing from happening without having government take control of corporations.

       Taxes and regulations are the problem my dude. Remove those and small business can thrive again. Government has no place in the private sector (or anywhere else IMO). Historically speaking government intervention in the private sector has failed over and over again. Just take a look at what's happening in Venezuela right now and you can see for yourself.

       Start by dismantling the regulations in place which achieve the same effect of protecting the larger players at the expense of newcomers.

       You may not appreciate that this is very much how the government operates, but from their perspective, the established outfit (ie the billionaire) is a major employer.

       Consider how many hundreds of thousands of people (if not millions) are currently involved in the taxation racket. The government is terrified of simplifying to a flat tax, because it would render almost all of those people unemployed.

       A maximum wage INSTEAD OF HIGHER TAXES on the rich is also important, because higher taxes only ever give the illusion of being for the benefit of the people. Too much is going to the federal government and not enough to the states. The feds shortstop the funds and blow it all on defense contracts, subsidies, pork barrel, etc, not to mention
       <em>
        massive
       </em>
       inefficiency and lack of accountability.

       It's always statist authoritarians with no ability or desire to create anything that claim money is evil. Demanding that everyone sacrifice themselves to compensate for your inadequacies and having the government enforce your will is the real evil. Not to mention the new culture of exploitation that would be created in your gift economy.

       So why don't you argue your points instead of trying to shut the post down?  Sidebar- Conspiracy: a secret plan by a group to do something unlawful or harmful.  I'd say there is LITTLE doubt that wealth inequality fits the description of harmful.  I don't know that this solution works at all and I'm more of the mind of helping others than I am hindering people.  It's a twisted cycle, though and I should know because I've been a part of it:  "Go do market research surveys against competitors and don't come back to me until you come back with something that justifies a raise for the CEO to the board." (and hopefully when my review comes around I'll get a nice perk for inflating their wealth further)

       "In all revolutions up until now the mod off activity always remained unscathed and it was only a question of a different distribution of this activity, a new distribution of labor to other persons,
       <strong>
        while the communist revolution is directed against the preceding mode of activity, does away with labour, and abolishes the rule of all classes with the classes themselves
       </strong>
       , because it is carried through by the class which no longer counts as a class in society, is not recognized as a class, and is in itself the expression of the dissolution of all classes, nationalities, etc within present society."

       The rich act very different from the vast masses living in the U.S. I mentioned those with money and power practicing aspects of socialism, but the government isn't "giving" it to them. They hoard the wealth all for themselves with the help of our corrupt politicians, which is a significant factor in our crony capitalistic system.
