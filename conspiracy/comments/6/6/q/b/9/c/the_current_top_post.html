       It wasn't an attempt to divide the sub...and this sub is not very united behind one cause anyway, there are people from both sides of the political spectrum and also people who don't care for partisan politics or the establishment.

       The defensive, emotional fervor involved in anti-flat earth comments always surprises me. Why do people care so damn much if someone else is entertaining the notion that the conventional concept of earth might be wrong? It is similar to the reaction you get when you tell a bible thumper that God doesn't exist. It fascinates me.

       It has nothing to do with them entertaining the concept. It's about refusal to acknowledge evidence that counters it. Have you ever got in an argument with a child or someone else over something you considered to be so obvious that arguing about it was practically pointless but they still insisted you were wrong and ignored all proof you had? It should be no surprise at all why people get so upset that Flat Earthers taint the waters around here

       And a lot of those people have taken the "scientific proof is psyop bunk" pill and think you've been brainwashed. I personally couldn't care less what shape the earth actually is, but I question folks that are so invested in science being the absolute truth that they get so emotional and vitriolic over it. Why do you care so much?

       I'm not even using scientific proof at this point because I realize that they feel this way. I'm using general observations that anyone can make, and yet, I get "The southern celestial pole doesn't exist" and "Sigma Octantis is fake" and "The stars don't rotate around a pole star in the southern hemisphere", all things which are not scientifically reliant, but things you can see yourself.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not invested in science being the truth at all, I actually believe in Antarctic Nazi bases as well as a form of Hollow Earth Theory. Shit, I've posted spirit science videos here as well as lectures by Manly P. Hall. I get emotionally involved because I see these people as intellectually lost. People willing to question what they've been told that for some reason have latched on to this theory for reasons that many of them can't even explain past "the government has been lying to us, wake up"

       If you seriously believe there is no proof of a round Earth other than science, then you're no better
      </p>
      <p>
       If a Flat Earthers argument to "why do the stars appear to rotate counterclockwise around the northern Celestial pole and clockwise around the southern celestial pole" is "Sigma Octantis doesn't exist and neither does the southern celestial pole" please forgive me for assuming they've done absolutely no research and are unwilling to look into anything that doesn't fit their flat worldview.
      </p>
      <p>
       Every single person with working eyes in Australia can see Sigma Octantis and the Southern Celestial Pole. To deny it is idiotic. To claim that they somehow
       <em>
        dont
       </em>
       behave that way is also idiotic, as it's based on observation, just as all Flat Earthers try to get us to do.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe the Earth is round because I have
       <em>
        absolutely no reason
       </em>
       to believe it's flat. Polaris, solar flares, star trails, the tides, eclipses, shadow lengths, there is absolutely
       <em>
        tons
       </em>
       of evidence to support a round Earth.
      </p>
      <p>
       Flat Earthers have "well the government usually lies" and "well the Book of Enoch says x" and drawings from ancient religions.

       How do you feel about people that don't question the MSM and follow what they're fed blindly? It frustrates me to see people do this even though they are presented evidence that the MSM don't have their best interests in mind, or have been lying to them, just like it frustrates me to see Flat Earthers deny it completely ignore evidence that contradicts flat Earth. It's like they all woke up one day and said "yup looks flat, everything else that says otherwise is fake or explainable by it being flat"
      </p>
      <p>
       It's pretty ridiculous that this entire sub and the entire conspiracy community outside of reddit is considered a joke because of something as easily disproven as flat Earth theory.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for why I'm so adamant about it, it's because it's willful ignorance. People choosing to be idiots when they could use this dedication or passion elsewhere is a frustrating waste of life in my eyes.

       Well, sure, but you can witness the MSM lies, spin and propaganda right in front of your face. And the MSM has a strong influence in shaping our perception, which is dangerous.

       The earth being round is after all, a theory. Theories should be constantly challenged. That's how science progresses. So maybe (extremely likely) the flat earth people are wrong, but if it leads others to be interested in researching scientific theories for themselves, or prompts science to do new experiments or research to further prove them wrong, how is that a bad thing? How are someone's beliefs about the shape of the earthy harmful to society as a whole?

       I can always tell when the shills brigade. Nothing but rude comments and personal attacks, with assumptions that anyone who disagrees with them supports "Donnie." They have a script they obviously adhere to. Not hard to notice at all if you're not on either side.

       A really good (liberal) friend of mine actually turned me on to Pizzagate, had done weeks of research and then instantly abandoned the concept when someone called her a Trump supporter on her Facebook. If you asked her now, she'd deny that global child trafficking is a myth that only the alt-right believes. It's crazy how effective the tactic is.

       That's what's been so insane to me. Pedophilic child abuse has now somehow become a partisan issue. It is effective. Nothing will ever be done about it when you get so many people to believe it's some right wing political conspiracy theory.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's another misunderstanding too. It started as "pizzagate" which led a lot of people down the rabbit hole to documentaries like "conspiracy of silence" and actual documentable, proven facts about high profile child trafficking rings all over the world. And all those facts can now be discredited by anyone who brings them up by simply calling them a "Trump supporter." I'm afraid this world is truly doomed. The brainwashing is far too easy to accomplish now.

       I know that. however, I've been here for longer than most of the mods. The moderation is a bit heavy these days. I still like some of the content but just find myself veering towards different areas now.  Thats a shame. I should be pushed away from a sub I love because the editorial team decide the rules change.

       I really don't think the moderation is as heavy-handed as you're implying.  If you actually check the public mod logs, I think you'd find that most of what we remove are either trolling, low effort, attacks against the sub and it's users, etc.  If there's "more" moderation these days, consider that there's also more garbage being posted these days.
