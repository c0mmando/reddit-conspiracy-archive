<p>How many folks believe the official story that the princess of Wales was allowed, by her bodyguards, to get into a car whose driver was apparently intoxicated. That the cameras in the tunnel malfunctioned, the flashes of light being &quot;camera flashes by the paparazzi&quot; </p>

<p>David Shayler, former MI-6 agent said he witnessed plans to assassinate Slobodan Milosevic using the same tactics: a chase car, the target car, and a lead car with a strobe light being shined into the driver of the target cars eyes while the chase car makes the accelerate to unsafe speeds...in a tunnel. </p>

<p>It&#39;s clean, neat, and most importantly it has absolutely plausible denial.</p>

<p>Edit: a word and punctuation </p>

<p>Oh, and she wasn&#39;t wearing a seatbelt....</p>

I do vividly remember my mom running over yelling that she had died though.

<p>Everyone seemed to love her because of her humanitarian aid. Held the hands of children with HIV when it was all new taboo n whatnot.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve read the even deeper conspiracy stuff that she was mortified to find out what the royal family really was (alledgedly reptile aliens) and the elitist world wasn&#39;t so squeaky clean.</p>

<p>All I know is that I don&#39;t have to be convinced that the establishment will kill high profile individuals, I have to be convineed on why.</p>

<p>It&#39;s like the JFK assassination.  There are so many different theories as to who and why he was killed.</p>

<p>But this <a href="https://chrisukorg.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/henri.jpg?w=215&amp;amp;h=300">pic</a> of Henri Paul sure looks like he&#39;s been MKUltra&#39;d where he was programmed to smash that Mercedes into that pillar.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve always thought they probably remotely swerved the car slightly into the pillars.  I would bet they had the technology back then.  Make sure the driver has a drink or two, and voila, plausible deniability.  The giveaway was why it took so long to get her to the hospital.  I&#39;m not buying the purported need to drive slowly or treat on site.  It was something like an hour or two, iirc.</p>

They needed a brood mare, and Diana did serve that purpose well.</p>

<p><strong>Frederic Bartholdi, the designer of the Statue of Liberty, was, of course, a Freemason, and very familiar with occult and Illuminati symbolism and philosophies.  The three major figures involved with the Statue, Frederic Bartholdi who designed the statue itself, Gustave Eiffel who designed the inner support structure, and Richard Hunt who designed the pedestal, were all Freemasons.</strong></p>
