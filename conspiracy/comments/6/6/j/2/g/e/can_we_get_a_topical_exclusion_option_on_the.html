Cui bono? That&#39;s the crux of CTs, and if all they&#39;ve got is non-standard narrative without even a hint of an agenda it probably belongs in a different sub. Some Flat Earthers have brought a theory along with them, and that&#39;s great. Most of it is just weird screeching about NASA, though. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>yes!!! this exactly. no theories, no attempts to go towards logical conclusions. cui bono, indeed! why would this lie exist? it appears that most FE folks believe that globe earth is an anti-christian fib made to denigrate the omni-whateverdom of GOD. they just don&#39;t have the balls to come out and say they think the world is 6000 years old and fossils were put there by the devil. </p>

<p>if something more than blind refusal of logic and scientific method (not scientific research, but methodical <em>inquiry</em>) were employed then perhaps the topic would not be so irksome. but it&#39;s not and irksome the topic remains. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry.. a few days late, but I was going back through reading responses. I&#39;ve taken quite a few geology classes (started college as a petroleum engineering major) and the reality is that we have no idea what&#39;s <em>actually</em> going on in the core or inner mantle.  </p>

<p>We have some really good guesses, but we&#39;ve never penetrated the crust, which is <em>extremely</em> thin by comparison, so it&#39;s not like there is a wealth of data that can only be interpreted one way.  I&#39;m not saying I believe in hollow earth, but it&#39;s just not completely incompatible with what we actually <em>know</em>, or plate tectonics, or the other commonly held geologic theories. The ones about the core and mantle have more to do with explaining the mechanics of our magnetic field than anything anyway.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I only entertain the idea that it could be hollow based on the holes at the North/South Pole pictured from space, the accounts (as you rightly say) of the Nazis etc which floats well on this subreddit and an almost indescribable gut feeling that the world is not as we know it.</p>

<p>If you listen to Admiral Byrd in one of his only televised interviews he states there is a land &quot;beyond the pole,&quot; that is larger than North America and has never been seen by man. </p>

<p>We are also all of a sudden finding &quot;molten carbon,&quot; sitting under/near the crust.  You as a petroleum engineer can highlight a bit more info on what this could mean on our understanding of &quot;fossil fuels.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>i am not asking to censor anything. i have seen ample evidence of different types that i myself could verify if i wanted to support spheroid earth spinning in space. watching other planets spin in real time through a telescope, using foucalt&#39;s pendulum to observe the spin of the earth, <a href="http://www.windows2universe.org/citizen_science/myw/w2u_eratosthenes_calc_earth_size.html">Eratosthenes&#39; Calculation of Earth&#39;s Circumference</a>, investigations into optical properties of light and curvature. </p>

<p>there are so many important and fundamental questions asked of these FE posters that go ignored, unaddressed, denounced of validity. RES was just what i needed. if you want to look at the same BS videos from flat earthers who refuse to answer to the material&#39;s content, go ahead. i just am tired of it clogging up real stuff. own up or shut up and these folks refuse to account for the fundamentals of their arguments. no thank you.</p>

<p>When you consider banning or censoring one aspect of a conspiracy, it&#39;s a slippery slope to others.</p>

<p>and i don&#39;t have a problem with flat earth itself. the methods of discourse are not productive and i keep seeing the same names post the same things without addressing other users&#39; questions towards their ideas. &quot;i choose not to recognize those questions as legitimate&quot; is not a rebuttal. maybe there is a sub r/beatingadeadhorse and Flat Earthers can all just head on over yonder</p>

    <div class="md"><p>At some point, most theories get to the level of govenmental structures, politics, and power-brokers of other sorts. The problem with pizzgate (and many other theories), is that people are presenting &quot;what ifs&quot; as truth, then shifting the burden to others to disprove that which has no substance to begin with. I&#39;ve been shredding people that do this since it began.</p>

<p>The problem I have with general politics is that people are coming here to exploit the users and the open nature of this sub. To discuss politics at the lowest possible levels because their nonsense would get destroyed out among more politically astute people. New accounts that do nothing but spam 2-3 other hardcore political subs...then here. Nothing further with them. It&#39;s all politics, all the time. They adjust titles and context to slip by the lax rules here and most people do not notice. As you can view in my history, I call these people out each and every day.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>sure, like how can argentina exist, it&#39;s not on the UN logo? the thing is a convenient representation of the UN organization--not some literal map that is rubbing the grandest lie in our faces. </p>

<p>The blue that appears in the background of the insignia was chosen to be &quot;the opposite of red, the war colour&quot;,[5] although the exact shade has never been officially specified by the United Nations.[6] The original colour the group chose in 1945 was a gray blue that differs from the current United Nations flag. The globe used in the original design was an azimuthal projection focused on the North Pole with the United States, the host nation of the conference, at the centre. The projection that was used cut off portions of the Southern Hemisphere at the latitude of Argentina, which was acceptable at the time, as Argentina was not planned to be an original member of the United Nations.[7] The projection was later altered so that no country will be at prominence within the flag. The new logo was now designed so that the globe is bisected in the centre by the Prime Meridian and the International Date Line.</p>

<p>In 1946, a UNO committee got the task of making a definite design, which was presented December 2, 1946, and adopted by the plenary session of the UNO on December 7, 1946. The earlier version had the globe 90 degrees turned eastward compared with the present flag, which has the Prime Meridian and the International Date Line forming the vertical diameter.

    <div class="md"><p>Sounds like someone is getting afraid. Going to copy paste my previous post:</p>

<p>dizzib.github.io/earth/curve-calc/ Buy a telescope or camera and find a suitable spot and see for your self. Don&#39;t be surprised when objects that should be hidden by earths curvature is completely visible, any day and weather. Either earth is flat or it is much bigger than what NASA claims. NASA says earths radius is 6371 km.</p>

<p>Your links are all ridiculous, the &quot;harness&quot; links use jump cuts and weird editing along with drawn lines to try to make it look like there is a harness when really therea nothing but lumpy clothes that fold strangely because of a lack of gravity.</p>

<p>Your video of &quot;bubbles&quot; has two indistinct white spots moving <em>in straight lines</em> unlike bubbles which have some random motion and generally travel in short trains, but quite like a small piece of dander travelling in vacuum without gravity.</p>
