       I lurk in this sub pretty regularly, &amp; I love that the things people post about make me think critically. However, I find that a lot of conspiracy theories posted here boil down to devil worship, &amp; I'm wondering why that is?
      </p>
      <p>
       Personally, I feel attributing an individual or group's motives to worshipping the devil seems .... religiously biased. People have historically committed atrocious acts in the name of many religions - ones that worship "God" &amp; ones that worship the "Satan." What's the point of mentioning a religious affiliation?
      </p>
      <p>
       When someone posts a wall of texts showing tons of evidence that supports a conspiracy, then closes it with "See?? Tons of occult, satanic references!! Blood sacrifice!! Rituals!!" it makes me question if there is some type of Christian agenda behind the post.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is there some conspiracy theory handbook I missed highlighting the importance of religious affiliation?

       Just because one might not buy into their mythologies it doesn't mean that they're not still sucking the blood off of baby dicks, sacrificing chickens and smearing menses on their walls.

       I definitely agree religion can be dangerous. It can drive people to do messed up stuff.
      </p>
      <p>
       I guess I just wonder if this fascination with naming devil worshippers is like McCarthyism? What proof do we have that this religion is truly the motive for what the rich &amp; powerful do?

       Some of them admit it. Some could be leading us astray. It does function as a catch-all term, sometimes incorrectly, but the historical constant seems to be the effort to divorce man from God (and make him his own god) as being "the devil's work". Devil being that which is "evil", God being that which is "good".

       I can see that. I think there are some people who are devil worshippers, but I really find it odd that not many people know about this "religion" that's been around longer than Christianity except for chickens getting sacrificed &amp; blood rituals.

       I don't think it's "devil worship" per se.  What I think going on is this:  the old forms of pagan worship as practiced by Greek and Roman aristocracy were extremely brutal, nothing like the neo-pagan alt-spiritualities today (naked hippies larping in the forest).  Aristocrats did brutal things because they worked (or seemed to).  These traditions got handed down throughout the centuries, and are still in practice today.  Christianity was just a religion imposed upon the masses to neuter them.  Aristocratic pretended to be Christians, while continuing the old pagan rites in secrecy.

       See, that at least makes sense &amp; has historical precedence. I'm just tired of people chalking everything up to good ole satanism to support their conspiracy theories.

       I suggest you watch William Cooper's Mystery Babylon to gain an understanding behind the 'devil worship' horseshit - what it really boils down to (or seems to boil down to) is that they worship 'intellect' - there are many symbols for intellect, ie Satan, exclaiming to be the 'morning star' - morning star -&gt; the sun -&gt; light -&gt; illumination -&gt; knowledge/intellect
      </p>
      <p>
       The symbols and crazed worship keep the masses confused and misled who try to figure out the elite - the elite believe it is their duty to protect their intellectual advances over the masses by any means necessary, as eventually they will be able to become 'gods' through the use of science, and create a utopia - science and intellect are the means to get there, and people who do not possess the same intellect are essentially just animals and may be slaughtered as the ends justify the means

       Wow. I really will look into that. I do see the attack on intellect every day. Our media is like a drug, sedating people's minds &amp; deflecting them from the truth. &amp; It's the elite who control that drug. This was a very good response. Thank you!

       Your welcome - i hope you find some truth.  The answer to challenging the system is fairly simple and pragmatic: apply yourself so you become intellectually competent, particularly in math and science so you can spur game-changing innovation that will benefit humankind; and learn to protect yourself - make it so you are worth more alive than dead, because by intellectually challenging the zero-growth model, you become an adversary.

       Yo, this is the most sound advice I've gotten on here. My thoughts have been trending that way for a while now. Ultimately, I'm just someone looking for the truth &amp; for a while I thought this sub could help in uncovering some. However, I see that its also influenced by those who seek to distort the truth as well.

       There are only two options. Selfish or not selfish.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you are a selfish person and everything that comes with it (greed, gluttony, etc.) then you are going to be viewed as Satanic or the devil.

       I agree that's how people view those who are selfish &amp; self serving in our society. However, is there any proof that there is a religious connection there? Or is that just attribution theory?

       I think it extends beyond religion.
      </p>
      <p>
       Religion is just a tool that tries to explain the reasons why something is right or wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       But, I believe we have an instinctual feeling in what we deem right or wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anything we deem "wrong" or "evil" is going to be lumped into Satanic territory.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, I also believe that the elite bloodlines have a knowledge of spiritual knowledge and have faith (just like anyone else) that "wrong" or "evil" is "right".
      </p>
      <p>
       And their belief is centered around the fact that evil (thus far) has triumphed good on Earth.

       It's funny you should say that. I met a fellow critical thinker, a guy I would not have much in common with, former military, very right wing, and he said to me, "I used to dig deeper into conspiracies but what creeped me out is that every time I got past a certain level, it always came back to satanic shit."
      </p>
      <p>
       That's what I've found, too. The devil is real, he's running the evil conspiracy.

       I've found that too, but I'm not sure I believe in the god/satan dichotomy. Especially because historically religion has been used to brainwash folks into being tools of religious leadership. So I guess the real conspiracy to me, is who is orchestrating these religious zealots?

       I think it is the devil. You may be correct and it is a human force, but there seems to be too much in the way of supernatural forces involved to make this strictly a material world matter.
      </p>
      <p>
       Someone wrote, on this subreddit I think, that the "conspiracy" is not linear....I will never forget that because I think there's a very good chance it's true.  If that's the case, we are talking supernatural indeed.

       I definitely agree - I was telling my close friend recently that I feel there's a spiritual war going on around us. I think we are coming close to finding "truth" &amp; those who have been working to hide it are fighting with all their power to stop us. I guess I figure the religious aspect of it is just the tip of the iceberg

       Alot of the things they call satanic have been around since before Christianity  (sometimes even judaism)  its just set in their belief that pagan rituals are devil worship. I mean i get that some of the stuff is bad but when you get down to it alot of it came before 'satan' was a thing. Like you see people saying ancient civilizations that are satanic (like egypt and the mayans) but really its just how christianity moved away from pagans and devil-fied it

       I totally agree with this. I am sometimes so disappointed that my fellow critical thinkers will do all this awesome thinking &amp; synthesizing of data to stop short at "devil worship" when it's been proven that the Church has conspired against the general public before as well :(

       Totally agree. The church doesn't even attempt to be humble abouy the influence it exerts over its followers. It's still mind blowing how the church can convince a poor congregation that giving money they don't have to the church will get them to heaven.

       Is it satanic if they arent worshipping satan? If they are worshipping the things that help them like the sun and the earth because they are grateful for their uses? Seems like a label more than anything. Even science has been ruled satanic (such as evolution, the theory that the earth is not the center of the universe, and a global earth which you see flat earthers saying is anti god) but it seems like that word just rallies christains against whatever is being called that

        But back to the claims of Satanic activity. This is a common ploy used by the CIA and FBI, to lead investigators into dark alleys. Long ago I learned that anytime I am being led into Satanism, Crowley, LaVey, and similar channels, I should know that the CIA is trying to divert me. It isn't Satanists that are running these events, it is most often military intelligence. But the black agencies use Satanism to cover their tracks. For most researchers, Satanism is a sexier road than the road to G-men, and they willingly take it. Rule number one in researching false flag events: ignore all links that lead to Satanism. Those are sucker links, put there on purpose by the CIA writers.

       Miles Mathis is disinfo supreme. He's hit the bullseye a few times but he's also often wide of the mark--see his recent piece on Trump's stolen election, where according to MM he only got 10-15% of the actual vote. Or the faked JFK assassination.

       His Stephen Hawking piece is for the ages, though.

       I tend to believe him but I haven't read even a quarter of his papers, as there are way too many. I don't particularly care what he thinks about American politics but what he said about satanism I believe hits the nail on the head. Satanism is the greatest artificial gatekeeper of all time. When most people run into satanism, that's where they stop and give up.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also can't fault him for believing
       <em>
        anything
       </em>
       about the voting in our elections because truly- none of us know a fucking thing. He may as well be right about Trump only getting 10-15% of the vote because we don't know whether he did or not and polls can't be trusted. His JFK theory was fascinating.

       I disagree on the satanism front. I think realms beyond our material world exist and the devil is some kind of malevolent force, even if not the pitchforked nasty of pop culture.

       There is no way Trump got 10-15% of the vote. It may have been stolen, but he certainly got at least 40%. The JFK theory is as nuts as it is fascinating.

       This totally corroborates what I've been thinking. It's always weird to me when smart people who have been able to research their way through a conspiracy, cite satanic worship as the motive because it's been seen that religion can be a conspiracy in &amp; of itself?

       Yeah. There's just too many things that come to a dead end at satanism. Like, that's it? All this was about weird shit satanists do? I don't think so. Satanism is simply an enormous invisible wall and there's crowds of people running into it head-first without realizing they can step around it.

       Go down the rabbit hole a little bit and you'll notice how much the elite are involved in the occult: black cubes and Saturn symbolism showing up in all sorts of corporate logos and headquarters, occult murals in Bank of America headquarters, Illuminati symbolism all over the media, references to Moloch and spirit cooking in the Podesta emails, terrorist attacks happening on dates with significant occult numbers, etc. Even Ronald Reagan consulted with a personal astrologer before making major Presidential decisions.

       I understand that religion impacts choices of individuals. I guess I just wonder why that isn't questioned? Religion has historically been used to brainwash. It seems a little lazy to just assume that devil worship is legit without any research into who is pushing the occultist agenda? I guess I need more info about that.

       I am not a religious person, but to understand the reality we live in, you have to go into more esoteric, or spiritual terms. This is ancient knowledge, far older than any modern religion.
      </p>
      <p>
       We're talking about our place in the universe and coming to terms with beings we don't yet fully comprehend, and a realty of many dimensions that interrelate.
      </p>
      <p>
       The basis of all the major conspiracies, and the truth that has been hidden is that these things are real. Most people have problems with terminology because of learned belief systems.
      </p>
      <p>
       The root of the 'hidden hand', the Cabal, the Illuminati, and all other names for it are groups that oppose the advancement of mankind to further their own purposes. They do not worship a 'devil' named Satan. Satan is only a word meaning adversary... In the Abrahamic religions the hidden controllers have played both parts, light and dark. The Jesuits, Zionists, Islamists are playing the same game from different sides.
      </p>
      <p>
       The true Divine nature of God is within ourselves. We are all creator-beings who are actually a part of God... Not an ET God, but the Source of ALL... The ones at the top know that all of the religions have been co-opted for their purposes long ago.
      </p>
      <p>
       Satanic ritual abuse is servitude to beings which would be called Archons, demons or djinn, depending on the culture. They could also be called ET, but are not the same as more physical ETs like Draco Reptilians... Lucifer is real too, but is more like a plasma-based AI than a walking-talking being.
      </p>
      <p>
       These are the things that should be talked about in this sub all the time because the story of humanity is more epic than anyone could imagine.
      </p>
      <p>
       We have lost our memory, and great civilizations have risen and fallen many times. Both positive and negative ETs have been a part of Earths history since the beginning. The last few thousand years have been rough, and we are just now seeing the light on the other side. The global awakening is real.

       I totally agree this should be talked about more on this sub. Using "they're a devil worshippers!!" as a motive for the actions of some wealthy/powerful people seems like it's too shallow. Especially if you don't look into what these "devil worshippers" believe. I am very interested in what you posted &amp; will definitely be doing some more research in that regard.

       Would you mind expanding on what you mean by Satan being more like "a plasma based AI?" It's a very fascinating concept.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also I'd always thought of the Reptilain and Archon stories as the being about the same creatures (I admittedly don't know much about either) interesting to see you have them as separate.

       Because the whole point is there is much more to reality than we realize or are told about. And that Satanic shit is ridicule compared to what the end of the rabbit hole is -which isn't really an end, per say-. It pushes you to see the world from a very, very negative point of view and that is something many people here fall into. Although that can be the catalyst to ones progress towards finding the truth if you may call it like that. In the end all is appropriate and honorable, All.

       Definitely. I think it's really the beginning of a bigger conspiracy to withhold "the truth" from the masses in an order to control them. I definitely think that's evil, but that doesn't necessarily mean people worship the devil.

       Omg!! This totally corroborates what I've been thinking. It's always weird to me when smart people who have been able to research their way through a conspiracy, cite satanic worship as the motive because it's been seen that religion can be a conspiracy in &amp; of itself?

       You'll probably learn how many

        don't

       like to have their subjective ideas of the devil challenged here too.

       Personally, I don't believe in the Devil.  There does need to be an anti-god who is responsible for the evils of the World. 
Who needs a devil when evil humans exist.

       There was an AMA with one of the Ancient Aliens guy and he said something similar- that after all his research he actually didn't believe in aliens, that he felt like there was an older force that had always been here and was responsible for fairy, elves, demon, etc stories - and how they correlated with alien stories - and after all his digging it got too weird and spooky so he was pretty much done. Also mentioned there were a large amount of strange unexplained deaths with UFO investigators

       Because they have no clue who's actually running the show so they default to what the elite want them to think. The "illuminati" and such. But the elite to actually practice satanism, that is true. We know who (((they))) are.

       People practice sick sects of each religion. How come occultists are the only folks who get any shine on this sub? Every single conspiracy on here boils down to the occult. You don't think that's weird as fuck? That every conspiracy on this subreddit boils down to the same damn thing? If you don't see it, you don't see it, I guess.

       Just seems to happen as you get closer to the "truth". I think it's just that there's this sect of Judaism that hold sacred the things that we call evil, and that they happen to run the world by getting people to fuck/kill kids, for blackmail.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some people take it to the extreme because it feels good to be on the side of good, and also makes it possible to fight them without having to imagine them as people (and therefore have to try to understand, which takes empathy, which causes pain); easier to just dehumanize them as "demons" or whatever than it is to go "what would happen in a person if they did what these people are purported to do?"

       I agree in that naming occultists seems to make the people in this sub happy. I guess I just feel like it is really naïve to think that "devil worshippers" are behind every single theory on here. What's the point of doing all that research to make a claim that, in my opinion, is very hard to prove. Unless someone is filmed performing certain religious acts, how can someone just assume that's what they believe?

       I find its easier to understand as 'positive and negative' forces as opposed to 'God and satan' but you're right, and actually I was pretty atheist until I started digging, but now I see how much evil or 'negativity' there truly is, which can only mean there's an opposite positive force, which I believe is by design, for without the choice between the negative and positive, we would have no true free will, and neither would exist. But I actually feel that everything does go back to some luciferian shit that only the elite and their movers are privy to, and you literally have to 'sell your soul' to them by doing some horrific shit you can never come back from ie child rape/sacrifice to ever get even close to their level. They are anti-creation, the hate us...for our freedoms ha...Idk just my take, hope I added something to the discourse

       I believe that there are some people who are involved in satanic rituals, but I just find it hard to believe that it is the source for everything. I think the elite have spiritual knowledge that they're withholding, but I just don't think it's only relegated to Satan. I guess I just wonder why people don't trust "other" religions on this sub, but when someone says that a prominent politician or celeb is a devil worshipper, the folks in this sub are like, "WELP! Mystery solved!!" instead of digging deeper?

       Yo, this is the most sound advice I've gotten on here. My thoughts have been trending that way for a while now. Ultimately, I'm just someone looking for the truth &amp; for a while I thought this sub could help in uncovering some. However, I see that its also influenced by those who seek to distort the truth as well.

       There was an AMA with one of the Ancient Aliens guy and he said something similar- that after all his research he actually didn't believe in aliens, that he felt like there was an older force that had always been here and was responsible for fairy, elves, demon, etc stories - and how they correlated with alien stories - and after all his digging it got too weird and spooky so he was pretty much done. Also mentioned there were a large amount of strange unexplained deaths with UFO investigators
