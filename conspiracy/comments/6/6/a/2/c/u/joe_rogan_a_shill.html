<p>discounting the value of public education</p>

<p>Of course I am.   Are you going to defend public education now?    Its pretty obvious that public education in the US as it now stands is a disappointment,  compared to some other countries.   The objective was to make it so bad that people would not object to privatizing it like prisons,  for corporate control and profit.    What they don&#39;t teach tells you more than what they do.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He does a good job of keeping the conversation going and making almost any topic interesting, but his own thoughts on most things are childish at best.  On politics he&#39;s especially cringeworthy and uninformed probably because he just doesn&#39;t understand how much the MSM is lying to him.</p>

<p>He&#39;s a &quot;Dude weed&quot; and &quot;Why can&#39;t we just all get along?&quot; tier normie.</p>

<p>He&#39;s pretty good at having a somewhat open mind and listening to the other person&#39;s argument so long as they don&#39;t go after his weed.   That said he rarely has truly controversial guests, so this is a lost opportunity.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Always found it hilarious the people who hate rogan. Usually seems to be the type to label masculinity  &quot;toxic&quot; and need a safe space. Everyone has bias towards opinions go being no different. I also believe TPTB told him to stfu about 9/11 and all that around the same time he had the &quot;ex&quot; cia operative who now owns his own intelligence firm... Im suuuure he retired ;) episode 541 i think it was </p>
