       C'mon, it was funny
       <strong>
        because
       </strong>
       of the circle jerk.  Tacomano123 pitched me a softball asking the question that way.  Personally, I don't mind Joe owning some of O.N.N.I and promoting them.  I have even purchased their "New Mood" product a few times.

       No.  I tried samples, but ultimately settled on Alpha GPC bulk powder (from PowderCity).  That + Phenylpiracetam = killer endurance/anti-fatigue and focus, ime.

       Too many shill accusations flying around.... people are waking up at different rates, and have different information sometimes. Everyone has a personal bias, ego mind obstacles. Does not mean they are all shills.

       Of course I am.   Are you going to defend public education now?    Its pretty obvious that public education in the US as it now stands is a disappointment,  compared to some other countries.   The objective was to make it so bad that people would not object to privatizing it like prisons,  for corporate control and profit.    What they don't teach tells you more than what they do.

       This whole "he doesn't say what I want to hear, so he might be a shill" thing is absolutely ridculous. The show is great, it's been great for seven years, and Joe often talks about his changing views.

       That's called healthy, when you adapt to change, and can grow as a person. People could use a healthy dose of it.

       Let me say I'm an enormous Joe Rogan fan and watch every episode. That being said for the past 3 years or so he has been steadily and actively moving away from conspiracies. Everything from believing in them to simply talking about them, he ALWAYS will resort to mocking it now.
      </p>
      <p>
       Notice how much he goes out of his way to mock FEers and fake space. He gives a lot of energy to make fun of the kind of people he enjoyed talking with and associating with just a few years ago.
      </p>
      <p>
       His show has been compromised. You won't see any ground breaking conspiracies come from JRE just government sanctioned facts.

       If that was true he wouldn't have done the episode with Alex Jones at all. It would be naive for us to assume Rogan isn't after the biggest possible audience.

       I view him more as a useful idiot than outright shill - he may have started out on the right food, but once the show got so incredibly popular it was co-opted.  A boatload of money has a way of doing that.

       He does a good job of keeping the conversation going and making almost any topic interesting, but his own thoughts on most things are childish at best.  On politics he's especially cringeworthy and uninformed probably because he just doesn't understand how much the MSM is lying to him.

      <p>
       He's a "Dude weed" and "Why can't we just all get along?" tier normie.

       He's pretty good at having a somewhat open mind and listening to the other person's argument so long as they don't go after his weed.   That said he rarely has truly controversial guests, so this is a lost opportunity.

       Always found it hilarious the people who hate rogan. Usually seems to be the type to label masculinity  "toxic" and need a safe space. Everyone has bias towards opinions go being no different. I also believe TPTB told him to stfu about 9/11 and all that around the same time he had the "ex" cia operative who now owns his own intelligence firm... Im suuuure he retired ;) episode 541 i think it was
