<p><a href="http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/entertainment-july-dec06-hollywood_10-06/">U.S. Military Helps Create Hollywood Films on War and Warriors</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Pentagon’s partnership with Hollywood starts at this West Los Angeles office tower, where every branch of the military keeps a liaison office to the entertainment industry.</p>

<p>&quot;Our mission here is to get the Navy onto the big screen and the little screen every chance we get, with every production that wants to use us. I’ll be blatant about it: We’re trying to get the Navy out there.&quot;</p>

<p>And what do Hollywood studios want in return for giving the military screen time? &quot;Usually, it’s equipment. Usually, they’re looking for toys. For them, we’re a provider. We’re a supplier, like everybody else. And Hollywood, they want the real thing. If they can get the real thing, they want the real thing.</p>

<p>If you want the military&#39;s assistance, you have to give them five copies of your script. They review the script. They make changes to the script to make it conform to the kind of film that they want to see. Most Americans have no idea that the content of the films and TV shows that they&#39;re watching are being influenced by military censors, that the military or the government is telling filmmakers what to say and what not to say.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Another link: <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/nov/14/thriller-ridley-scott">&quot;All these people that run studios - they go to Washington, they hang around with senators, they hang around with CIA directors, and everybody&#39;s on board.&quot;</a></p>

<p>What does football have to do with patriotism? Is it just a game, or is it North Korea-style propaganda? When the National Anthem is playing during a football game, on that last note when you start to get goosebumps, they light off fireworks and military aircraft fly over the stadium. This entrenches a deep love for the military industrial complex and boosts recruitment.</p>

It goes into detail on how the military/CIA staged the murders to effectively end the hippie movement and the role  Tates father played, he was a Lt Colonel in military intelligence at the time. The whole thing was basically a movie played out in real life. Here&#39;s a link. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This was a really good read! I recommend this to those who remember what this sub was like before the election. I have some questions about some of it but overall it&#39;s relatable to almost all conspiracies here. For example this struck me when the whole &quot;satanic PG shillary&quot; stuff started flooding this sub - </p>

<p>&quot;
But back to the claims of Satanic activity. This is a common ploy used by the CIA and FBI, to lead investigators into dark alleys. Long ago I learned that anytime I am being led into Satanism, Crowley, LaVey, and similar channels, I should know that the CIA is trying to divert me. It isn&#39;t Satanists that are running these events, it is most often military intelligence.&quot;</p>

<p>People were so distracted they neglected the true villians - the intel agencies.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No shill - that makes sense though, the CIA are terrorists who have been undermining the US as well as other countries worldwide for decades.</p>

<p>Of course local police would be trying to help... Unlike cops in the US, most other countries&#39; police forces aren&#39;t brainwashed thugs that treat the populace as if they are all dangerous criminals. </p>

<p>Not that China is any bastion of free speech or tolerism or anything, but that situation is actually plausible, because of reality: CIA <em>are absolutely evil scum</em>. </p>

<p>Local police in countries not cucked by globalists actually help their citizens, imagine that. The fact that people in the US find it bizarre for cops to lend a hand in crisis, but find the child-raping, genocidal CIA just fine is the problem.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I fucking love posts like this. Why?</p>

<ul>
<li><p>A highly reputable &quot;mainstream&quot; news outlet.</p></li>
<li><p>A seemingly innocuous subject that (to most untrained eyes) doesn&#39;t present anything unseemly or conspiratorial. </p></li>
<li><p>Quotes and information from official sources.</p></li>
<li><p>All the well-sourced information is then presented through a questioning, critical lens (that of <a href="/u/A_Reddit_Conspiracy">/u/A_Reddit_Conspiracy</a>), and we see evidence of an actual, confirmable conspiracy. Furthermore, it&#39;s a conspiracy that the conspirators <em>don&#39;t realize is a conspiracy</em>; literally, 98% of the people in the arrangement described above (outside of high military brass) probably have the best of intentions.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I honestly believe that <em>most</em> (though certainly not all) of the biggest conspiracies are plain as daylight, presented in major media outlets for us to see. The American public is just not questioning or critical enough to see where the problems lie.</p>

<p>I also believe that quite often, most of the &quot;conspirators&quot; have good intentions, or aren&#39;t aware that they&#39;re being used to disseminate propaganda; they&#39;re simply indoctrinated to the point where they think the arrangement is above-board and innocent.</p>
