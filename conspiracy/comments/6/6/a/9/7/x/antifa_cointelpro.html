<p>After that we&#39;ve seen numerous reports of peace activist groups (not antifa, grannies against nuclear power and such) being infiltrated one way or another. The same for the right. But these are different reports, I&#39;m looking for specific programs they&#39;ve implemented. </p>

<p>No it didn&#39;t. You need to read a bit more.</p>

<p>Antifa is a peace movement, depending on how you look at it. Peace is more than just the absence of conflict, it&#39;s the presence of justice. Fighting injustice <em>is</em> working for peace. Don&#39;t confuse peace with simple nonviolence.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re looking for pride, there are parades for Italian pride, Irish pride, Scottish pride, Polish pride, et al.

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly my point. I agree with the basis of what some of Spencer has to say, but the whole <em>ride the wave</em> aspect he&#39;s taken has made me suspicious because of the circumstances of its rise to popularity.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t agree with a lot of the identitarian stuff and it sounds more like the race baiting, social justice warrior, feelings based argument. While being <em>captivating</em> to his audience, he still just repeats talking points and rides the responses from agitators. A lot of his public persona is strikingly similar to the crap they spew at <em>BLM</em> events.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That money is going to SOME of the organizers who are drumming up support doing &quot;grassroots organizing&quot; - most of the rallys and marches and signs and stage rental and stuff is going to be paid for by all the volunteers and participants themselves, but within a lot of these movements will most certainly be some very highly skilled and charismatic nucleation points that are going to be on the payrolls of parent organizations the smaller activist groups they are getting up and running won&#39;t ever know about.</p>

<p>I personally witnessed an undercover cop or who knows what who tried to weasel her way in to our group and immediately take things up a couple notches after approaching a group of friends who had gone to see Ralph Nader speak last year just completely fall off the face of the Earth after being gently questioned. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve also watched organizers materialize, take control over organically formed coalitions by running incredibly underhanded slander campaigns against the original founders, put in less competent and sincere leadership and then &quot;move out of the area&quot; and cut off all contact with the friends they made while here. It sounds crazy, but it&#39;s true.</p>

<p>That was the link I saved but they killed that blog. As far as I remember it had a scan of an official payment to Antifa people for services(demos and probably the usual performances at &quot;undesirable&quot; party meetings).</p>

<p>Antifa e.V operates/ed? on Facebook and had official society entries in Bonn, Osnabrück and Lübeck.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.taz.de/!5020381/">http://www.taz.de/!5020381/</a> writes a fake satire article to ridicule it without directly claiming it to be falsified.</p>

<p>TAZ are pretty much the channel for the current green/left &quot;intelligencia&quot;. Some forum posts are interesting, the others are in line with the ridiculing. But forums are strongly &quot;managed&quot; these days so it&#39;s up to you how you take the credibility there.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A scan of a official payment doesn&#39;t mean much in times where Photoshop exists. If you want I can show you your payments you got from soros.</p>

<p>The TAZ Article is based on <a href="https://twitter.com/AKderVorsitzend/status/564012595183898624">this twitter post</a>, which is a know satire account. I don&#39;t see what the forum should prove, obviously some people are aware of the joke and while others aren&#39;t. </p>

<p>Antifa e.V. doesn&#39;t &quot;exist&quot; as a e.V., it&#39;s pretty much a social media thing with their &quot;membership cards&quot; and stuff. The Antifa isn&#39;t very well organized, there are many different groups with different ideologies, sometimes even accusing each other of anti-Semitism and other stuff. </p>

<p>The &quot;official society entries&quot; you mention are local groups who consider themself to be a part of the Antifa. It&#39;s probably quite useful for organizing events, like protests.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You should read more about Cointelpro and other methods to disrupt &quot;threats&quot;. These methods are being actively used against activist, or real/fake terrorism threats (example <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/4cpb19/its_official_john_langs_death_has_been_ruled_a/">John Langs case</a>). However this isn&#39;t all, as now law enforcers count on directed energy weapons for <a href="http://spectrum.ieee.org/tech-talk/semiconductors/optoelectronics/mits-3d-microwave-camera-can-see-through-walls">surveillance</a> and <a href="http://biggerthansnowden.com/">harassment/torture/discrediting</a> purposes. This is what we fight.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Infiltration: Agents and informers did not merely spy on political activists. Their main purpose was to discredit and disrupt. Their very presence served to undermine trust and scare off potential supporters. &gt;The FBI and police exploited this fear to smear genuine activists as agents.
Psychological warfare: The FBI and police used myriad &quot;dirty tricks&quot; to undermine progressive movements. They planted false media stories and published bogus leaflets and other publications in the name of targeted groups. They forged correspondence, sent anonymous letters, and made anonymous telephone calls. They spread misinformation about meetings and events, set up pseudo movement groups run by government agents, and manipulated or strong-armed parents, employers, landlords, school officials and others to cause trouble for activists. They used bad-jacketing to create suspicion about targeted activists, sometimes with lethal consequences.[43]
Harassment via the legal system: The FBI and police abused the legal system to harass dissidents and make them appear to be criminals. Officers of the law gave perjured testimony and presented fabricated evidence as a pretext for false arrests and wrongful imprisonment. They discriminatorily enforced tax laws and other government regulations and used conspicuous surveillance, &quot;investigative&quot; interviews, and grand jury subpoenas in an effort to intimidate activists and silence their supporters.[41][44]
Illegal force: The FBI conspired with local police departments to threaten dissidents; to conduct illegal break-ins in order to search dissident homes; and to commit vandalism, assaults, beatings and assassinations.[41] The object was to frighten or eliminate dissidents and disrupt their movements.</p>

You can also dig up stories on the Sovereign Citizen groups but they&#39;re few and far between. I have no doubts they have plants in antifa groups and they usually set up something big. Not just credit card size knives, but amfo bombs where there&#39;s serious collateral damage.

    <div class="md"><p>There are a lot more players out there than just the FBI - or anyone related to any government - so it&#39;s hard to say. I don&#39;t really see the motive for the FBI on this one, though, it&#39;s too purely partisan politics. Maybe a right-wing group or person, maybe it&#39;s a genuine, uh, not movement but perhaps conglomeration of anarchists. Maybe a foreign actor attempting to spread instability - that isn&#39;t an unusual game. There is a reason people like Project Veritas have tried to incite left-wing groups to violence before and it&#39;s because violence attributed to the left does not serve the interests of the left, the same being true in reverse. That doesn&#39;t mean it can&#39;t be actual nutters who think they&#39;re doing good, though. Never doubt that the world is full of genuinely crazy people, to one degree or another. Most things aren&#39;t false flags or setups - stupid people do stupid things and crazy people do inexplicable things.</p>

<p>If these Antifa people were being steered by the FBI I would expect more than clashing with Trump protesters, though, there would be encouragement to escalate - protesters clashing is nothing new and neither are anarchists. I got my first taste of tear gas during the Battle in Seattle, when I was trying to catch a train to Portland and ended up caught up in some protests.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just don&#39;t think it&#39;s enough to indicate outside actors; these clashes are common and pretty juvenile. There are even Trump supporters who seek them out, too. If it is an outside actor I&#39;d suspect a foreign actor over a COINTELPRO operation - these Antifa people haven&#39;t any real goal, they&#39;re not effective, not going anywhere. If anything they simply distract from the actual anti-Trump protests and I don&#39;t think the FBI has any interest in that, though some right-wing groups might - Project Veritas has attempted similar things in the past, though not very well - or foreign agitators. Anyone from Russia to North Korea to basically anyone not relying on US stability.</p>

<p>I think, though, this is more of the typical stuff that always arises during contentious political times - and Berkeley sure is the place for it. There is a reason they keep picking Berkeley for Trump events or Milo events, etc.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, it could be; mostly it just comes down to it being either idiots doing idiotic things or idiots being egged on by some group and while either is entirely possible, one is especially common. Plus, the solution is the same either way, when things are only at this level and there is no evidence of a COINTELPRO-style operation; convince them they&#39;re being idiots and a great many will knock it off and, often enough, reveal who was encouraging them behind the scenes. That or escalate things so far the whole thing bursts open and gets investigated top to bottom - not my ideal solution.</p>

<p>Anymore, though, you don&#39;t even really need to infiltrate groups to steer them. You can use fake social media groups, shills, and positive reinforcement from fake news sites tailor-made to appeal to whatever crowd you&#39;re trying to influence. Especially groups that lack a cohesive structure and an acknowledged, visible leadership element. You can hijack control of an entire movement if it lacks any centralization to resist you, through the clever use of online propaganda - and you can do it on the cheap, too. Things are a lot different than they were even 20 years ago. The saying &quot;there&#39;s a sucker born every minute&quot; needs to be amended to &quot;there&#39;s a sucker born every millisecond&quot;.</p>

<p>That being said, <strong>do not fallaciously assume this means Russian isn&#39;t</strong> using disinformation and propaganda.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I also would like to know how you know that the tactics/reasons for FBI infiltration fifty years ago is still relevant today?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because you mentioned COINTELPRO. That involved the FBI infiltrating Leftist organizations <strong>to monitor them</strong> for Commie sympathies and violence.  You yourself wrote &quot;Antifa = conintelpro&quot; in the title. The FBI infiltrates organizations to spy on them. It&#39;s the same with ISIS. Remember the news a few months ago about ISIS executing a Russian spy? Many countries have spies  in there. Violent, political organizations are no different. The FBI is a law enforcement agency, so it is obliged to monitor extremist groups operating on American soil.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Couldn&#39;t the FBI be cultivating these groups to further justify their budget, crack down on freedoms etc?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But they never cultivated these groups. Even in COINTELPRO, they infiltrated them and even used unethical methods to stop them from increasing in size. The FBI does not have budget problems. To my knowledge, only the DoD and CIA beg for more budget money.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>This is common knowledge. They spied on MLK. That was a part of COINTELPRO. Does that mean they controlled him too? Of course not! Likewise, with the Soviet-infiltrated American Communist Party, the FBI infiltrated it. Same with anti-war organizations against the Vietnam War (interestingly, the FBI may have right. It&#39;s estimated the USSR spent <em>billions</em> funding anti-Vietnam war groups in the U.S.).</p>

<p>Because there&#39;s no evidence of the FBI ever having cultivated them. I get what you&#39;re saying. The FBI is notorious for entrapping potential Jihadists and then catching them right before the act, just so that they can show they&#39;re doing a good job. But that&#39;s not the same thing as cultivating them and using them against someone, as you claim.</p>

<p>In the scheme of it all, antifa isn&#39;t a threat whatsoever to the establishment. They are actually useful to the establishment. I just don&#39;t see how the deep state would not want to grow them to serve their agenda.</p>

<p>It has violence in its ranks. Not only Antifa, but BLM&#39;s upper echelon&#39;s too most likely contain FBI informants. </p>

<p>And Antifa is not useful to the establishment. Respectfully, Trump and the Republican entourage are all part of the so-caled &quot;establishment&quot; and anyone who thinks otherwise is simply deluding themselves. Antifa is basically an offshoot of Europe&#39;s anti-fascist groups from the 20th century. It&#39;s not being &quot;controlled&quot; by the deep state. That&#39;s just a partisan smear.</p>

<p>Got that backwards, neoliberals like Soros are funding leftist groups like AntiFa and BLM, in the hopes of starting racial/civil unrest.</p>
