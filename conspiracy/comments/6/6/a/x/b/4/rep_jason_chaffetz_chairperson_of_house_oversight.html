He usually runs unopposed, and there is big money being put forward in an actual opponent. Plus, he has made a couple huge mistakes which would haunt him come election time. Also, this is the first time where non Mormons make up the Salt Lake City area, although his gerrymandered section would probably overwhelming vote for him again. </p>

<p>He will be offered some 7 figure position in a GOP think tank and not have to worry about anything.</p>
