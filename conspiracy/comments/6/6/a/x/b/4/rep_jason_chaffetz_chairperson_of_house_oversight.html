       CIA Brownstone operations. Get a party house. Get underaged girls who look over 18 to have sex with politician. Videotape it. Now you own this politician. I feel sorry for this guy.

       More like his constituents are fed up with his whiney ass, all talk, no bark. It wouldn't be much of consipanracy if he accepted a 7 figure salary in the private sector like many GOP predecessors have done when they have completed exposure in high profile seats.

       I don't know why you are being down voted, but this is probably the correct answer. He usually runs unopposed, and there is big money being put forward in an actual opponent. Plus, he has made a couple huge mistakes which would haunt him come election time. Also, this is the first time where non Mormons make up the Salt Lake City area, although his gerrymandered section would probably overwhelming vote for him again.

       He will be offered some 7 figure position in a GOP think tank and not have to worry about anything.
