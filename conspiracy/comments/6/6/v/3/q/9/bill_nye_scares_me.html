<p>His show is called &#39;saves the world&#39;</p>

<p>This guy uses religious language everywhere he goes, as a skeptic.</p>

<p>He advocates force, CONSTANTLY, and has authoritarian tendencies when debating and explaining his beliefs.</p>

<p>This is a good display.
<a href="https://youtu.be/2dcYJIRnUC8?t=1m43s">https://youtu.be/2dcYJIRnUC8?t=1m43s</a></p>

<p>It just really pisses me off to see Bernie Sanders talking with him about their intellectual ideas on how to control and order society into a better place.</p>

<p>And it really pisses me off to see a bunch of grown adults kept in a perpetual adolescence, an arrested development, by giving this children&#39;s entertainer their full allegiance and faith.</p>

<p>Also he&#39;s always telling us the benefits of modified crops and injecting stuff into babies. It&#39;s just weird.</p>

<p>He does it with such authority, and calls anyone who objects a denier.</p>

<p>He&#39;s playing a large part in dismantling religion especially Christianity which will ultimately lead to the compromising of society. (I&#39;m not religious btw, and may be totally off, but this seems to be the agenda.)</p>

<p>Sorry, I&#39;m kinda rambling, some thoughts.</p>

<p>&quot;Science is true&quot;

    <div class="md"><p>Another good term for him is junk science. And Ask who gives this guy a platform? </p>

<p>The reason he is still around is because he relates to the generation that were kids when his show was popular.. actually I think his segment aired around precisely this present moment, 9am on a saturday. But he was ingrained in our minds as an acceptable scientific man with childlike energy. Of course you don&#39;t really question the science when you are 7, and some still don&#39;t question it 30 years later. </p>

<p>He seems to be struggling to keep his thoughts straight after a few minutes. I do love how Tucker treats him. Nye &quot;That was your word, you guys... That... That&#39;s not my claim.&quot; ... &quot;I&#39;m not sure that&#39;s exactly what I said Mr. Carlson.&quot;</p>

<p>Now, a few colleges have given him &quot;honorary&quot; degrees. Those degrees are not from taking classes but because he is a media personality. Dude is not comparable to real scientists.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t listen to him, michio kaku spends more time  actually doing physics research than on his public persona. He is one of the main inventors of string theory and is one of the main guys trying to figure out an 11 dimensional model of the Universe.(that is, he is solving incredibly complex equations)
In the beginning of his career everyone thought string theory was a waste of time but now his work is the most favored explanation for everything(but it&#39;s not complete yet, gravity is hard to figure out)
He&#39;s really dumbed down in interviews and such, but he is the real deal when it comes to mathematics and probably the smartest mentioned in this thread.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Have climate change deniers tried making an argument that is consistent with evidence from more than one source? Are these claims repeatable and demonstrable? If your claims are refused by the scientific community, go back to the drawing board find more evidence, because if it is indeed true you will find more evidence that back up your claims. No one is saying not to prove the most popular and credible scientific ideas as wrong ( not that it being popular actually proves anything), but make sure your own bias isn&#39;t projecting onto your experiments. Which most scientist try there best to do and why multiple experiments amongst different impartial groups of people is a good idea. Do that and your claims will surely gain traction because of the evidence.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So, some money that someone was happy to pay got wasted?  Science is a private and public industry.  Sometimes money is wasted discovering that something wasn&#39;t true.  It&#39;s better to know the science on &quot;gravitational waves&quot; is shaky at best than to go on thinking it&#39;s something viable to develop technologies out of.  I get what you&#39;re worried about from big companies that are meddling in your life with freaky science stuff because big daddy warbucks told them it&#39;s what they want.  What I don&#39;t understand is the pushback from educators like BNSG and NDT and Carl Sagan when they suggest that you, the learner, can verify for yourself what is the truth using these methods.  That you should <em>think for yourself</em> and <em>question authority.</em>  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9A-F8JEFyY">Watch this video</a> of Bill Nye at Ken Ham&#39;s museum when it opened, and in it there is a little girl that Ken encourages to ask Bill about his understanding of the world.  This was most likely to goad him, and make him challenge a young girl on her beliefs.  Bill told her that one day, by reading all kinds of books, he hopes she&#39;ll ask herself the same questions.  Bill <em>likes</em> being questioned.  Most of us science types do.  Evidence is verifiable via experimentation.  That&#39;s what we have proof of, that&#39;s what we talk about as being <em>absolutely</em> true.  But all of the people I mentioned in this comment (save for Mr. Ham) would be pleased as could be to find out that what they had believed their entire lives was wrong.  It would excite me, I know for sure, because I would have a whole new set of data to learn and integrate into my understanding of the world.  Being skeptical empowers you to make decisions for yourself, not to follow some hive minded group think.</p>

<p>The video you show preaents a fairly calm Nye confronted by an aggressive presenter. Most of the things hes saying make absolutely zero sense as the products of conspiracy. Global warming is widely studied and verified. And generally goes against the interests of the groups supposedly incolved in conspiracy.</p>

<p>And your comment about rwligion makes no sense. Religion has historically acted as the greatest forces of control and manipulation over the population.

    <div class="md"><p>And yet the mainstream media and corporate line is usually that of denial. And governments, which are preumably filled with puppets and shills, have been unable to meet even their own goals for green energy, while continuing to support and dole out subsidies for dirty energy.</p>

<p>And im not really sure why theyd need a conspiracy to achieve renewable proliferation. It would have to happen at some point, since non renewables necessarily will run out. </p>

<p>I can only assume youre trolling with the science thing.

    <div class="md"><p>Why? Why would my demand change anything.</p>

<p>Why not just use their puppet politicians to enact laws promoting green energy and dicensentivising dirty energy.</p>

<p>And again, why would they want green enerfy so badly. It is a necessary part if our future whether they conspire to make it so or not. Regardless of any cobspiracy, wed all need to adopt renewables anyway, so why go to all the bother </p>

<p>I personally have no crusade. The world can burn for all I care. But, as far as I can see, a conspiracy to replace polluting and non renewable sources of energy with green renewables is not something that is achieving any success, since non renewables are increasing every year, givernments are failing to meet their own energy targets, and coal seems to be making a ressurgance.</p>

<p>Maybe there is a conspiracy of green energy promoters. I dont understand what they have to gain. But if there is, theyre spectacularly failing to achirve anything, since their global warming and environmental catastrophe propaganda has been going for 40 years, with no one taking it seriously until very recently, and oil and coal use increasing every year.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Im fairly surw youre trolling, at this stage. Im not sure why youd qualify who you talk to based on their ideological leaning, unless you simply wanted an echo chamber. Address the content, not the curator.</p>

<p>Okay, maybe there is a conspiracy. Maybe that is their goal, whoever they are... to make any energy which produces c02 as byproduct illegal. What do they gain? You say a monopoly, so i assume they are people who own large chunks of renewable energy companies. </p>

<p>Renewable energy, and energy production in general is very low margin. Even if you could achieve a monopoly, the gains would not justify a vast conspiracy.</p>

<p>And, if they did, renewables have to happen anyway. Non renewables will usefully run out in the next 30 years. And, even if we got 100% support for renewables right now, it would take 10-30 years to fully rwplace our non renewable supply. </p>

<p>So, the renewable energy industry has been conducting a vast and extremely costly conspiracy involving hundreds of thousanfs of scientists, and the forgery of vast amounts of data and theory so they can gain ground at an apparently marginally faster rate in a low margin industry that they would 100% dominate due to the depletion of non renewables, anyway, at absolutely no cost or risk to themselves. </p>

<p>Maybe this is true. But theyre obviously mad. They should funnel all their cobspiratorial resources into promoting tobacco ad a health pannacea right after they buy shares in big tobacco. Theyd make far more money, and it would actually be something to worry about. A monopoly on windmills replacing the current monpolies on oil is not something that especially worries me.and i dont see why it would worry you or anyone else.</p>

<p>Science is a method of learning not a belief you moron. Science tells us not to accept anything until we test it for ourselves and can replicate the experiment repeatedly. Religions are an opiate of the masses. If you want to hold onto your beliefs feel free but know you&#39;re an idiot for saying that science works one way.</p>

<p>As for Bill Nye&#39;s comment about jailing deniers, he&#39;s not referring to the common man such as yourself for spouting idiocy. He&#39;s referring to company executives who fudge studies by hiring their own &quot;scientists&quot; to state that man-made climate change is a hoax.
<strong>Science</strong> allows debate and discussion. Hence why they have peer review where fellow scientists can rip into each other&#39;s studies.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><a href="/u/MKWalt">/u/MKWalt</a> I get what OP is saying and I largely agree with him.  OP is in support of the scientific method, he&#39;s just saying it seems Bill Nye and others are abandoning the part of the scientific method wherein contradictory findings are considered in earnest and not merely swept under the rug because &quot;the facts are in and it&#39;s final&quot;.</p>

<p>If we&#39;re all about science let&#39;s not shy away from debate.  Consent in the scientific community does not automatically confer truth to the majority.  There is nothing scientific in using rhetoric that essentially amounts to &quot;shun the non-believer!&quot;</p>

<p>It&#39;s disappointing to see that people fail to grasp such a straightforward critique.  I think we&#39;d all be better off if more people were willing to admit, &quot;I haven&#39;t actually read a significant amount (or any) of the scientific literature on climate change.  I&#39;ve basically been adhering to an ideological belief system where I trust that I&#39;m not being deceived.&quot;</p>

<p>As for my personal outlook on the whole issue, it strikes me as very likely that humans have played a role in global warming.  But I&#39;m not about to pretend that I have any authority over people who oppose the official narrative.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If that were the case, we&#39;d be able to find a natural cause, but that&#39;s not the case. </p>

<p>And then you&#39;re also ignoring that we know greenhouse gases such as CO2 cause more heat to be trapped. It&#39;s basic logic.</p>

<p>Without some major event, the rate of change for the Climate is pretty damn slow, for example, coming out of a previous ice age, it took the Earth 10,000 years to warm just 4°C, it&#39;s taken 150 years to rise 1°C because of us. Projections showing that in the the next 85 years, that could be up to 4°C. </p>

<p>4°C in 225 years, compared to 10,000 years. That&#39;s a hell of a difference.</p>

<p>as for your ideas on religion, i think you should take another look, for it is SCIENCE that doesn&#39;t allow disbelievers. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Science encourages you to form alternate hypothesizes. Almost all advances in science over the centurys have resulted from disbelievers. The foundation of science is asking questions, taking educated guesses, then proving those guesses with <em>verifiable tests and evidence</em>. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Well science works in ONE way and if you don&#39;t believe you&#39;re a DENIER and should be jailed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is suuuuuuch bullshit. How many people have actually been jailed for denying science? Where the fuck is this actually happening. On the other hand endless wars have been fought and millions have been killed due to differences in religious beliefs. IDK what alternate universe you are living in where religion is suddenly tolerant of non believers.</p>

<p>Just look at this thread. Every top comment is mocking Republicans while the common sense comments are downvoted to the bottom.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Those scientists used to be able to get quite a bit of funding from the fossil fuel lobby, but now even the oil giants acknowledge climate change and are simply lobbying for their own bottom line. At what point would you recognize it as a branch of science worth study and not some conspiracy theory to...achieve what, again? Are we all being subjugated for a carbon tax? </p>

<p>I still haven&#39;t seen a &#39;natural cycles&#39; argument that accounts for how <em>quickly</em> things are moving now. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because cyclical changes in the climate throughout history are not something any climate scientist denies.</p>

<p>It is the rate of modern climate change, and the cause.</p>

<p>Every previous climate change had a reason for it happening, it didn&#39;t happen out of thin air, and they also happened gradually over thousands of years unless something disastrous happened like a meteor hitting the earth and causing mass extinction.</p>

<p>Modern climate change is on a much smaller scale, and also we under the scientific processes causing it.</p>

<p>Remember the hole in the Ozone layer? Scientists told the world it was being caused by Ozone depleting chemicals, and thanks to a global effort to reduce its use, the Ozone layer is now slowly recovering.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Eh, I&#39;m not saying I enjoy the many grown-up children around me, but I also think about how truly unhappy so many of the generations before us were. Divorce, abuse, heavy drinking, all rampant but hidden under a genteel polish. Lots of these millennials are choosing better partners and living more fulfilled lives doing whatever weird and stupid thing makes them happy. Stuff that used to be an embarrassing secret for that guy who&#39;d been an accountant for three decades can be done in the open now. </p>

<p>At some point you stop caring how other people get by in this very difficult world. Or I guess you can spend your own valuable time worrying about it? </p>

<p>To me, it&#39;s a sign that modern life is becoming too complex and frightening for the average person to handle. Couple that with no immediate physical threats (no WWII or Cold War) and you have a generation that never needed to get more serious. I wouldn&#39;t want to draw any broader conclusions than that without a study, but honestly it seems like the least of our problems. At least those types are fluent enough to find information when they want it. There&#39;s a whole other chunk of society too stupid to even see the cracks in any given narrative. </p>

<p>That&#39;s not data in the scientific sense. You are simply scientifically illiterate and don&#39;t really understand the concept of science.</p>

<p>Yeah. And that is a real example of circular reasoning. Unlike the statement &quot;science questions science&quot;. </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Well, yes. And they are correct in doing so.</p>

<p>They don&#39;t &quot;trust&quot; those people because of a book they have written. They trust the facts written in science books because they can be tested and verified.</p>

<p>The problem in this conversation is that you simply don&#39;t know what science is. You are scientifically illiterate.</p>

<p>Science can be fully understood. From the ground level up. Any scientist starts on a basis of mathematics and logic. </p>

<hr/>

<p>I will try and give you an insight into what science is and why it&#39;s fundamentally different from any religious beliefs:   </p>

<p>University education in <em>any</em> scientific major usually starts with some kind of Mathematics 101 class. And regardless where you are in the world the world almost always quite literally starts with your professor teaching you <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peano_axioms">WHY</a> 1+1=2. Not <em>that</em> 1+1=2 but <em>why</em>. </p>

<p>Any scientist is literally taught how to establish axioms (i.e. assumptions about the world that he/she deems to be inherently true, the very definition of faith). Every single scientist is taught how to create his/her own frame of interpretation of reality. There is no universal truth in science. You can say 1+1=42 and your mathematics will turn out to be just as valid as normal mathematics.</p>

<p>I know this is difficult to grasp as a non-scientist, but regardless how you define your premises about reality, regardless on what basis you start, you will always see the same results in science.</p>

<p>That is why, even if you kill every single human on the planet and destroy all of human knowledge, if you then create new humans and put them on earth, they would create the same science books again. That is why even though throughout all of human history all of our religions were different, our science was always the same. People in Japan had different religious beliefs than people in China or Russia or Europe or America or Africa... but they all had the same scientific insights and were able to communicate based on them.</p>

<p>That is why, if we ever meet aliens, we will always be able to communicate based on science.</p>

<p>This is completely different from religion. If you killed every Christian and destroyed all Christian scripture and all Christian ideas and buildings worldwide... Christianity would never come back. Nobody would ever make up the same exact thing again. </p>

<p>Science is a real world process relying on a multitude of humans from all backgrounds worldwide engaging in researching a thing and making conclusions based on testable evidence.</p>

<p>The entire point of science is to ensure that the things that are claimed to be true can be directly examined, tested, repeated by everyone else and always making sure that you state the limits of your research and having all of it confirmed by others.</p>

<p>The real fundamental difference here is that 500 years ago &quot;knowledge&quot; of religion was hoarded so strongly that they protected even the knowledge of reading and writing to a certain extent, lest it spread to the masses. Consider that versus the stance of Bill Nye who advocates for increasing science education across the board.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First of all, Bill Nye looks like a creep.</p>

<p>With that out of the way...</p>

<p>We all need to keep in mind that his ONLY formal training in science is a BS in mechanical engineering. This isn&#39;t a PhD. This isn&#39;t a medical degree. This isn&#39;t even a field that deals with larger environmental, medical, education, or even general science issues. He has a <strong>BS</strong>. Your college professors are more qualified to speak about science and educations issues than he is. Hell, high school teachers are better qualified. And this guy is setting the tone for national policy???</p>

<p>Bill Nye started out as an engineer but left it for acting and has been an actor ever since. The science was his &quot;hook&quot; that made him stand out. [This is him in his first TV acting gig].(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6-SJLlneLc">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6-SJLlneLc</a>)</p>

Yes, my chemistry and biology professors may be more qualified in their education but they would not be able to captivate an audience like Bill Nye has.

That&#39;s cute that you think he looks like a creep let&#39;s see a picture of you who is clearly not a creep.</p>

<p>I love how you people downplay the man&#39;s education but haven&#39;t come up with anything to contradict his statements.</p>

<p>When I don&#39;t feel well I call my friend who isn&#39;t a doctor but she is a nurse. And when I build birdhouses I don&#39;t call for an architect but my buddy whose hobby is woodworking. Neither of them would be qualified in your description.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>&quot;Bringing attention&quot; to science is great. Never had a problem with that. BUT now he&#39;s been stepping into the political arena...arguing and promoting very particular viewpoints that affect national policy. Quote from Nye: &quot;We want to remind our lawmakers that science is part of politics,&quot; Nye told Live Science. &quot;Science has historically [been part of politics] and should inform policy.&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>downplay the man&#39;s education but haven&#39;t come up with anything to contradict his statements.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, the topic of my comment was just referring to his background. But if you want to talk about it, which Bill Nye statements in particular are you referring to?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>When I don&#39;t feel well I call my friend who isn&#39;t a doctor but she is a nurse. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nurses are quite qualified to offer medical advice. They spend several years learning a very specific medical trade with hands on training. They also practice medical care daily in their profession.</p>

<p>Building a birdhouse is not architectural design. It is a part of hobby woodworking. A hobby woodworker is the perfect person to call.</p>

<p>Bill Nye had four years of mechanical engineering (along with core courses) in college. Practiced engineering for a few years after that and he&#39;s been an actor ever since. The only things he&#39;s really qualified for are calculating the stresses on a truss bridge and giving suggestions for a good headshot photographer.</p>

Not long ago, doctors shilled for Big Tobacco. You should always be skeptical of science like any authority. Science is a useful tool but it is subservient to money and corporate interests.</p>

<p>There is a lot of money in climate change, which is a rebranding of AGW, Global Cooling, the Ozone, etc. It&#39;s a billion dollar industry serving Agenda 21. Do we ever talk of pollution anymore? The environmental conversation has shifted entirely towards this one subject.</p>

You said at the beginning that none of these plebs are in on the joke but followed it with &quot;they&#39;re all just useful idiots&quot;.

    <div class="md"><p>You are absolutely right to be scared. &quot;Scientism&quot; is a more accurate word to describe his beliefs. Scientism is defined as an &quot;excessive belief in the power of scientific knowledge and techniques.&quot; And the world follows because science is &quot;right&quot; and the science &quot;has been settled&quot; and religion is a fairytale created by the elite to control us. Bullshit!</p>

<p>My skepticism over science has always been because of this...scientists are trying to be the only source of information on the planet and are devoutly dedicated to their &quot;peer reviewed results&quot;. Look at the top post on the front page of reddit right now (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/66wxrs/seen_at_the_march_for_science/">https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/66wxrs/seen_at_the_march_for_science/</a>). This is absolutely untrue yet because it is said in the name of science it must be true. It has tens of thousands of upvotes and those upvotes represent how many morons out there religiously and extremistly believe in science. One of the top comments is about how, if they could travel back in time (good science there right!), they wouldn&#39;t just kill Hitler, they would kill Andrew Wakefield...another &quot;scientist&quot; whose suggestions of looking into the potential side effect of the MMR vaccine brought him his downfall. They claim his paper was debunked but it was not debunked it was smeared.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s the proof on how untrue the polio vaccine claim is is...<a href="https://youtu.be/Twch-T-n8Ns">https://youtu.be/Twch-T-n8Ns</a></p>

<p>Suzanne Humphries is also a &quot;scientist&quot; and she absolutely contradicts the nonsense notion that the polio vaccine was responsible for the end of the polio epidemic. Absolutely untrue. Watch the video to learn more. </p>

<p>But yeah, this &quot;march for science&quot; bullshit is very fucking scary. Eugenics was accepted science back in the day and if we followed that to its logical conclusion every person with a minor dirth defect would be sterilized. Every deaf and mute person would be sterilized. And again, we are beinf presented a binary solution to a very very non-binary area. Yes science is god and gospel of reality or no I am a retard that denies all science as heretical to the made up fairy tale that I believe in.</p>

If they wanted us to learn science in college, the first class any of us took in a STEM program would be titled, &quot;SCI 101: intro to scientific theory and thinking.&quot; Not the case.

<p>Science isn&#39;t about 100% proving something as &quot;objective reality&quot; it&#39;s about find what is most true. And there is plenty of research about GMOs and vaccines showing that they&#39;re fine. There really is. Just because some nutjob rants that vaccines make kids autistic, that doesn&#39;t mean their point of view is as valid as research and it doesn&#39;t call into question &quot;objective reality.&quot; If you&#39;re actually interested in what research has been done I encourage you to seek that out. It&#39;s very easy to say &quot;there are only hypotheses and theories&quot; when you haven&#39;t actually looked deeply into it. There is very little debate over these issues by people who are actually experts. The people that introduce doubt are generally ones that don&#39;t know what they&#39;re talking about. And by the way &quot;theories&quot; are the closest to truth we have in ANY field. A &quot;Theory&quot; doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s on shaky ground. That&#39;s the colloquial use of the word. A theory is a set of facts and assertions that continue to pass the experiments we throw at it, so we continue to consider it &quot;true.&quot; Yes sometimes they&#39;re disproven, but that&#39;s because the process of science is working, not because some art major who is really against GMOs doubts it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You misinterpret what a theory can be at its worst. I hear this a lot by people that don&#39;t seem to really give any value to all the failing theories or parts of theories that get edited throughout the years. Of course a theory is on shaky ground if you consider that many theories are not secure. The closest to truth can still be FAR FAR away. I know the definition of scientific theory thanks. It means very little when you are talking about subjects that are not studied thoroughly. </p>

<p>And you have to be kidding on GMOs lol if you think that an industry which mostly funds its own studies, meaning very little independent study for long term effects, is not on shaky ground when it comes to things like Glyphosate. Look at where the industry is going. Even the frickin&#39; WHO labeled it a probable carcinogen. And the only reason they don&#39;t go full tilt on it is because of intense lobbying and millions of dollars being thrown around.</p>

<p>You can yell to the skies but everything new that comes out with GMOs needs verifiable independent testing for anyone to consider it safe long term. Until that is done you will just have to suffer with people not giving a shit what industry shills want to sell them.</p>

<p>You act like science is 100% bulletproof and doesn&#39;t get paid off ever. Bullshit. And complete lies.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The process of science is revision and correction. Changing a theory is a good thing because it moves us closer to the truth. No other process that we have does it better. Theories changing is not a reason doubt science. Sure you can doubt science put out by Monsanto because they obviously have a dog in the race, but that doesn&#39;t mean you doubt Science with a capital S. If you do, what are you turning toward? What method do you have to figure out better whether GMOs or vaccines are bad for you? You realize that almost every soybean in the world is a GMO at the is point? If you have had any soybeans in your life they were probably GMO. Most of the corn is gmo, and the wheat too, and a million other things even to the point that they&#39;ve said they don&#39;t know what % of the food is anymore. And yes of course we want to study them and make sure they&#39;re okay, but it&#39;s silly to say that because there&#39;s some dissent or some bad studies out there, there is &quot;no objective truth.&quot; Of course we can never know anything for SURE, but you have to throw out literally everything if you take that approach. You have to not be able to get out of bed cause you don&#39;t know if you&#39;ll fall through the floor. You have to forget the word for juice. The point is to figure out how to get closer and closer to the truth, and the best way we&#39;ve figured out how to do that is science. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s a ton of science that comes out of universities and independent groups and government groups. But even if there isn&#39;t, the great thing about science is that everyone is trying to prove everyone else wrong. So if someone puts out bad science, everyone else has a vested interest in overturning it. You can win the nobel prize by proving yourself wrong. Pointing only to corrupt studies from corporate sponsors and saying you can&#39;t trust science because of them is throwing out all the good with the obvious bad. The solution to bad science is good science. Good science is where you&#39;re getting data for glyphosphates. How do you know THAT isn&#39;t corrupted by corporations? There is good science out there, and the solution to bad science on GMOs and vaccines is to follow that, not just to start believe some other belief system that has even less support.</p>

<p>To say all science on these subjects is bad therefore there&#39;s no objective truth is quite a leap. Bill Nye is talking about all the good science that IS done on these subjects. He&#39;s not simply a corporate shill repeating science he could obviously discern is false.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You can&#39;t do those things. Because studies cost millions of dollars. I hear this illogical stuff all the time lol. You, you there son, go out and fund your 5 year GMO and Glyphosate studies! You can do it!</p>

<p>This is such bullshit lol. Those studies cost millions of dollars, and the only people doing the the large ones on GMOs are currently in Russia. Well over 50% of GMO studies are purely paid for by corporate interests.</p>

<p>Bill Nye is a corporate shill. Nothing you will say will ever convince me otherwise. He has ZERO fucking qualifications to be speaking on GMOs. In fact, very few people have the qualifications necessary to speak on them in part because there are literally ZERO 5 year studies done by independent scientists on the majority of all GMOs.</p>

<p>You don&#39;t label something safe when you don&#39;t even have a 5 year study to back something up. But corporate science labels things safe with 90 day studies lol. And this is why you see lawsuits everywhere you go with pharmaceuticals. This is why you see mistrust from the public.</p>

<p>People trust good science. But there is hardly any good science when it comes to these large corporations trying to shill their products. GMOs are unproven. And currently the WHO lists Glyphosate as a very probably carcinogen. Now that is bullshit, because ten years ago they were telling me that Glyphosate was completely safe.</p>

<p>It is not. Period. And you can&#39;t deny that shit anymore.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Simply saying independent studies exist on these issues proves absolutely nothing. I don&#39;t even know what you want to convince anyone of with such a short and useless statement. The majority of scientific evidence said Glyphosate was totally safe ten years ago. Now it is labeled a carcinogen by the WHO. In ten more years it will probably be banned.</p>

<p>But you are telling me that science is always good and always right, except you know when the corporate sponsors of science pay for shill studies to prevent the truth. </p>

<p>Yeah, but that hardly ever happens! RIGHT.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><a href="/u/MKWalt">/u/MKWalt</a> I get what OP is saying and I largely agree with him.  OP is in support of the scientific method, he&#39;s just saying it seems Bill Nye and others are abandoning the part of the scientific method wherein contradictory findings are considered in earnest and not merely swept under the rug because &quot;the facts are in and it&#39;s final&quot;.</p>

<p>If we&#39;re all about science let&#39;s not shy away from debate.  Consent in the scientific community does not automatically confer truth to the majority.  There is nothing scientific in using rhetoric that essentially amounts to &quot;shun the non-believer!&quot;</p>

<p>It&#39;s disappointing to see that people fail to grasp such a straightforward critique.  I think we&#39;d all be better off if more people were willing to admit, &quot;I haven&#39;t actually read a significant amount (or any) of the scientific literature on climate change.  I&#39;ve basically been adhering to an ideological belief system where I trust that I&#39;m not being deceived.&quot;</p>

<p>As for my personal outlook on the whole issue, it strikes me as very likely that humans have played a role in global warming.  But I&#39;m not about to pretend that I have any authority over people who oppose the official narrative.  </p>
