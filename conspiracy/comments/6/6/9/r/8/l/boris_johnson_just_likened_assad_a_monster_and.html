        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Here is exactly how the the skynews article begins:</p>

<p>Headline: Boris Johnson calls Assad a &#39;monster&#39; who needs &#39;decapitating&#39;</p>

<p>Sub-head:The Foreign Secretary urged Russia to end their support of Assad and said Britain could support further US airstrikes in Syria. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Boris Johnson has likened Syrian president Bashar Assad to a &quot;monster&quot; who needs &quot;decapitating&quot;.</p>

<p>The Foreign Secretary was asked in the Commons how Mr Assad could be punished for using chemical weapons without allowing a &quot;virulent Islamist regime&quot; to replace him.</p>

<p>Mr Johnson said he agreed with the wisdom of the remark from Julian Lewis, the Conservative chairman of the defence select committee.</p>

<p><strong>&quot;The essential thing will be to have a political process that preserves the institutions of the Syrian state while decapitating the monster</strong>&quot;, he said.</p>

<p>The Foreign Secretary has previously said there will be &quot;no impunity&quot; for the people responsible for the chemical weapons attack.</p>

<p>Mr Johnson also suggested that Britain could support the United States in the event of further missile strikes on Syria.</p>

<p>He said it would be &quot;very difficult&quot; for the UK to say no to a request for support from the US to a future strike if it was in pursuit of similar objectives.</p>

<p>Earlier this month the US fired 59 Tomahawk missiles at a Syrian airbase which was suspected of launching a chemical attack and they have threatened further action.</p>

<p>Mr Johnson said the US did not ask the UK for specific support ahead of that strike.</p>

<p>The US airstrike this month was the first direct military action taken against President Assad by the US.</p>

<p>In 2013, the House of Commons voted against airstrikes in Syria and the US, under President Barack Obama, also decided against direct military action against Mr Assad.</p>

<p>Whilst speaking to the Commons, Mr Johnson encouraged Russia to end its &quot;blind support&quot; for Mr Assad following growing tensions between the west and Russia over the right course of action to take in Syria.</p>

<hr/>

<p>NOTE: I took down the original post because the title was misleading--it read:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Boris Johnson just called for &quot;decapitation&quot; of Assad...When did it become acceptable for US/UK politicians to openly call for the assassination of other countries leaders (or for the overthrow of their government)?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I thought it was important to clarify that Boris Johnson did not <em>openly</em> call for the decapitation of Assad--he merely said &quot;The essential thing will be to have a political process that preserves the institutions of the Syrian state while decapitating the monster&quot; (which is not an outright call for assassination--but extremely forboding language nonetheless.</p>

<p>Very sorry for the error--but I didn&#39;t want a factually incorrect title to mislead users as to what type of threat was actually made by Boris Johnson.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Overthrowing the governments of Afghanistan, Iraq and Libya led to chaos which those countries have yet to recover from. After the illegal US-led invasion of Iraq, Interim Governor Paul Bremer  disbanded the Ba&#39;ath Party (Iraq&#39;s Army) leaving 300K men unemployed.  US forces, under <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ca1HsC6MH0"><strong>Col. James Steele</strong></a>, then trained/funded Iraqi torture/death squads which were patterned after the CIA&#39;s Phoenix Program from Vietnam and fed the sectarian violence.  The US military then flew <a href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2011/06/federal-reserve-shipped-billions-to-iraq-which-were-then-stolen-involved-in-other-unsavory-activities.html"><strong>cargo planes filled with bales of cash</strong></a> over to Iraq--no one knows how much but it may have been over <a href="http://www.cnbc.com/id/45031100"><strong>$40 billion dollars</strong></a>.  No receipts given.</p>

<p>US officials also indicated the cost of the Iraq invasion would be $60 to $100 billion before the invasion began (I think it was Dick Cheney on NBC&#39;s <em>Meet the Press</em>).  Harvard has estimated the cost of Iraq and Afghanistan Wars to be $4 Trillion+ including long-term costs for US soldiers.  </p>

<p>There&#39;s only a tiny of sliver of plausible deniability in there. Language is important, and this &quot;ambiguous&quot; pronouncement (from a former literary editor and Oxford scholar) was clearly was no accident. </p>

<p>Do you think a British Foreign Secretary has ever publicly stated that a foreign head of state was a &quot;monster&quot; who &quot;needed decapitating&quot; before? It&#39;s wildly inappropriate.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Assad is one of the few remaining leaders in the Middle East who still actually wears suit-and-tie (western secular clothes). So of course he has to be removed. Because, according to NWO planners, all these countries need to be pushed back to the Middle Ages – all controlled by religion and tribalism! So that they can be paraded as ‘the other’, and bombed with a good righteous feeling!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The USA has never been on Assad&#39;s side. The fact that there was such an outrage and then absolute silence after ISIS used chemical weapons on civilians as well is very telling. I don&#39;t think we are trying to destroy ISIS one fucking bit. It seems pretty obvious they are trying to hide any news that shows we really don&#39;t give two fucks about chemical weapons. It is all about toppling his regime and controlling the country.</p>

<p>Whether he bombed his civilians with chemical weapons is up for debate since an official investigation has not been done. But these other attacks by ISIS are clearly done by them, with them taking credit. And we could care less. Now we have moved to starting war with North Korea. Looks like the world war 3 plans are going smooth without any resistance.</p>
