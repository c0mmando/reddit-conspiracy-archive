       Before the election, this sub had some interesting conspiracy theories. Now, it seems like it has become an extension of Breitbart to push conspiracy theories pretty much against the left.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean, I get that conspiracy theories about the left could exist, but why do we never see any about conservatives on here? Lord knows there are enough conspiracy theories about Trump and his dealings with Russia.

       Trump is the president so of course there will be conspiracies surround him. I don't feel like the average number of Trump-related posts is much different than the volume of Obama-related posts when he was president.

       I think we have had a few crossings in discussions on this sub. I kind of feel like this sub has moved from a
       <strong>
        discussion
       </strong>
       sub to an
       <strong>
        accusation
       </strong>
       sub. Basically who can scream the loudest to get their point across instead of discussing different/alternate theorys. I don't know if a remedy is required. But it's how this sub's direction is heading. Which for people (like me) who have been here a long time, it's frustrating to watch. Do you feel the same? or am I talking crazy?

       What I see here is a bit of a microcosm of things on the site as a whole. Various easily identifiable (and defeatable) talking points from separate camps/tribes of users who vary in degree of professionally for their ability to slide a forum.

       I have had faith in the mods here for a long time, even after giving up all faith in the "top sub" reddit mods a year ago. But I honestly don't know how this can slide back to how it was. I don't think this sub needs to update harsher rules around discussion. The sidebar states"

       I highlighted the most important part which I feel is the last thing happening on this thread currently. I don't know if it can be fixed but it's fucking sad to see it disappear, since it has been the biggest thing going for this sub for so long.

       Apologies I didn't mean you were doing anything wrong or that you could correct what "I personally" see as going wrong! I honestly don't think there is anything you can do. I think we are all in this together and hope we can wade out the worst of it! The only thing I could possibly see helping, is encouraging discussion vs shut down. But I don't think that is something the mods should own. That should be the core subscribers as a whole. Sorry I to come off as placing blame on the Mods or insinuating the mods didn't do their job. I don't believe that to be the case.

        Not saying it's you, or the mods, but it's pretty clear there are people here defending the gov and trying to crush anything negative about Trump.

      <p>
       And there's people here doing just the opposite. Such is the balance here on the board. People are free to any political opinion they fancy here. Unlike other subs.

       Nope, not what they are saying. Do you deliberately twist things to fit your interpretation of your reality?

        I remember when this sub promoted the MSM stories that backed up their theories. Sad.

       Do you 'member? Because I don't  'member MSM theories promoted here almost ever.

       Well something's happening that's obvious enough for the keen conspiracist's eye to note. It would be churlish to discard such suspicions with sarcasm. Thank God/Zeus/Science/Whatever that there really are bright enough people here to notice the changes. We are being actively discredited by stupid, bigoted "news".

       There are plenty of conspiracies on the right. How about Reagan getting shot by the neocons? Reagan was a Goldwater Republican (similar to Ron Paul's ideas), and to get elected, Reagan sold out to the neocons. Once elected, he told them to go to Hell, so they had him shot. He survived, and became a different man!!

       Uh ok Joe Coors discovered and groomed Ronald Reagan, Joe Coors was a Bircher and funded the start up Heritage Foundation which became the defacto Republican Party until the Kochs found them to be losers and took over the party completely after the 2012 election.

       Before the election there were daily Podesta threads here. You and your HRC supporting friends left us in droves to stay in the echo chamber that is r/politics. You couldn't dare hear anything negative about madam prez. Now a few months have past and you guys on a daily basis poke your nose back in here and ask what happened? You left, that's what happened.

       You answered your question -- because the mainstream media already pushes conservative conspiracy theories about Trump urophilia and Soviet spies.
      </p>

       It's like asking "why don't we ever hear about the conspiracy of Islamic hijackers to attack the World Trade Center?" It's already covered in every major outlet.

       Here's my question: Do people not consider Foxnews to be part of the mainstream media? Seeing as to how they have more viewers than all the other cable networks, wouldn't that make them the "mainest" of mainstream?

       I don't know about other people, but I would consider Foxnews to be about the same quality as other network news except with an obvious conservative bias. They all play cheerleader for America/Israel wars.

       Because so much of MSM is liberal, you might encounter a lot of conservative push-back in the alternative media.

       its an influx of Trump supporters because a lot of us here were redpilling over there prior to the election. I welcome it because this their opportunity to wake up just like we originally did, to see beyond Trump and realize the whole playing field is a massive scam.

       This is just a natural evolution of this sub and its okay. Same deal when the Boston bombing happened, there was a massive influx that came and went.

       Something happened this election season that shook someone up and helped become the catalyst for massive propaganda.

       We had true-blue globalists in power and so the discussion was focused more on them, for the most part.  You had your alien theories, prison camp threads, but most of it was financial info related to 9/11 and past events, Agenda 21/2030, blah blah blah.
