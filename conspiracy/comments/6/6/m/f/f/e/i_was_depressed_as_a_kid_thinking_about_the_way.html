        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I think it hit me my first day of &quot;day care&quot; when I was 3...I remember my mom taking me to &quot;some place&quot; at 5:00am. It was still dark, I was confused and scared. It just didn&#39;t make sense...&quot;I have to go to work sweetheart&quot;. What is &quot;work&quot;? Why do you &quot;have&quot; to go there? Why am I being shipped off here every morning with people I don&#39;t trust, and kids I don&#39;t like, for what? At age 3 I knew something just wasn&#39;t right with the way the world was to me. Then came school, dealing with bullies, stupid classes and dumb assignments. &quot;Why is this important and why is this my only option?&quot;...</p>

<p>Everywhere I looked I was being offered some kind of &quot;order and form&quot;...church, schools, sports, camp, day care. Forced into these institutions without my own decision. No regard for my creativity or talkativeness and energy as a kid, or my love for drawing and music. </p>

<p>&quot;Your son is different, he has problems following directions and sitting still, perhaps medication?&quot;</p>

<p>My mom was smart thankfully and said no to meds.</p>

<p>I guess I just sort of figured &quot;well, everyone else is doing it so it must be normal&quot;.</p>

<p>Then were taught that we are &quot;free&quot;, and we should be thankful for this life of limited freedoms.</p>

<p>I always hated authority figures telling me what do to. Teachers, day care assistants, rude adults, and especially police. My disdain and distrust for the police remains to this day.  <strong>I want to see all the &quot;Order&quot; and &quot;form&quot; being forced upon us be destroyed forever. I wanna see the whole thing come tumbling down to the fucking ground FOREVER. And WE THE PEOPLE can make a NEW world that benefits all of us equally.</strong></p>

<p>Now I realize These people have robbed us of our destiny, trained us into thinking were &quot;lucky&quot; to be able to work 40 hours a week, 1/3 of our precious lives away, and it&#39;s time to take it back. I love being a part of this community, and I love all of you my blood brothers and sisters. </p>

<p>Love and Peace are coming to us all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A great friend of mine recently said:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There is a reason based in science and logic that human beings are good things.  They are members of our species.  Therefore they are worth more than members of any other species.  Our species is a cooperative species.  Our design whether by God or evolution or, as I believe, both has been that of cooperation.  Not only is cooperation good for us, but we are designed to do it.  We need to do it.  We can&#39;t not do it.  And the less we do it, the more it makes us feel bad and makes things go wrong.</p>

<p>We are so designed to cooperate that for the most part we have to classify people as non human to hurt or kill them.</p>

<p>By cooperating we and our ancestors have survived, we have reproduced, have cast our offspring into the future and they have repeated this process.  We have out competed every other life form on this planet.  We have risen to the top of the food chain, developed self awareness and intelligence, and tool use.  We have built civilizations which have proved time and time again that when we cooperate the most astounding and amazing things happen.</p>

<p>The entire purpose of life is to achieve the immortality that no individual life-form can have by surviving long enough to send copies of itself into the future, and for it&#39;s offspring to repeat this process.  Currently we are winning at this.  By cooperating.</p>

<p>Think of how much better we could do if we expanded cooperation and eliminated the impediments and restrictions to cooperation.</p>

<p>Unfortunately you&#39;d be in such a minority that you&#39;d be the butt of endless dirty tricks until you were made ineffective. That&#39;s what has happened to all such good people. The only thing that can be done is the total rejection of psychopathic leaders from the local police to the top central bankers. I don&#39;t see it happening though.  I can&#39;t even get support for that idea here.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are entitled to your feelings, but objectively you&#39;re incorrect. You obviously live in the West, where our decadence and high standard of living allows us to escape reality to some degree. Most people in the world aren&#39;t so lucky. Physics and nature are emotionless - that&#39;s not to say that you need to be too, but forgetting/ignoring this reality can create a lot of problems. This is most prominent in what has been termed the &quot;progressive revolution&quot; in the West. This movement is neither progressive, nor revolutionary. It has been played out countless times throughout history with great humanitarian atrocity in it&#39;s wake. The idea that society should be split into cultural groups where the haves give to the have-nots by force, and all social injustice is be equaled by benevolent authorities, gives rise to authoritarian governments that end up accomplishing anything but equality, charity or benevolence. </p>

<p>TLDR: be a good person, but never lose perspective. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re correct. People who don&#39;t have a capacity for conscience or remorse  do seek positions to control others who they fear. They believe that we are all secretly just like them. They will do absolutely anything to gain power over others  and they will do it without conscience or the ability to feel remorse for the damage the \y do. They have no personally felt reason to lead those they have power over away from harm and will actually create harm they can profit from.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s both nature and nurture.</p>

<p>I told an investment banker relative 5 years ago I was going to label the leaders  as psychopaths and the term would stick because it&#39;s clinically correct
 to do so. I&#39;ve come a long way but it&#39;s only a small percentage of the way that it must end up going. I like to put it this way but it hasn&#39;t exactly caught fire, I can&#39;t imagine why not though.</p>

<p>Here.</p>

<p>&#39;If someone has  the power of life or death over you, wouldn&#39;t you prefer for that person to at least have some sort of conscience?&#39;</p>

<p>As of now our leaders have not been required to show any evidence of ever having any. They might fake it but those of us who don&#39;t have to fake it would recognize that immediately.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I need to try meditation. I have heard over time, it can make you more patient, more relaxed, you won&#39;t feel like the world is crushing down on you, you take your time more. Almost like it slows your brain down a bit to normal functioning level. After 20 mins, it DOES have this effect for me.</p>

<p>My neck and back muscles relax and crack, and I feel centered. It&#39;s easier for me to meditate and focus on my breathing when I&#39;m high on marijuana. It&#39;s hard though and takes dedication. But I KNOW it has health benefits. Meditation is actually like a legit thing these days, mainstream and even accepted among the &quot;medical community&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lol you described it perfectly there and what its done for me. Its funny because I once thought it was a pointless activity, but I turned to it because I was going through some stuff. For me, it taught me to be even more patient then I already am, and made me.much more content with everything in life. My dumbass stopped doing it a whole ago and I realized I get more angry at stuff now. Gotta hop back on them daily morning meditations, this time I&#39;m gonna try 30-40 minutes instead of 12-20. See what difference it makes. Good luck to you!</p>

<p>Also, you want to dissolve government and authority. How exactly would that work in a society as complex and advanced as ours? Has anarchist ideologies ever proven to have worked in modern society? </p>

<p>You say &quot;we the people&quot; need to rise up and take what&#39;s ours, then agree below with someone who says that most people in power are sociopaths or psychopaths (they also seem to be confusing the two). So once we dissolve the power structure, what goes in its place? How do we maintain an infrastructure that can feed and protect people without installing some sort of oversight? And if you dissolve said oversight and install a new one, why wouldn&#39;t it be filled with the same type of people that previously filled it? </p>

<p>Also, where is your evidence that these leaders always have sexual fantasies about children beside the circumstantial pizza gate conspiracy? Is there any psychological studies or evidence pointing to people in power being interested in children sexually or &quot;sexual sadists&quot;? </p>

That is just the normal part of growing up. The only cure is to become internally emotionally self sufficient. Create an island of serenity around yourself in the chaotic sea of the larger world. You can&#39;t change the world but you can change yourself.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re freedom is in proportion to how you prioritize money.  You need enough to live but if you make it a sole pursuit, you&#39;ll have less freedom.  If you take on debt then you&#39;ll need more money.  If you want a house and a family then you&#39;ll need even more money.  The same goes with court and law issues and medical care  They control us through money and it&#39;s hard to get around that.  The entire process is to condition you to generate revenue for them and they decide when, how and how much.  If you learn to live with less money, then you&#39;ll have more free time but less that you can participate in and take advantage of.  As soon as, soon as you become an adult, they want to lend you money but it&#39;s on their terms.  They&#39;ll lend you just enough to control you.  If you become successful then you&#39;ll be compelled to join their ranks and do things their way under fear of having your money taken away.  It&#39;s a strange life.  Most of know instinctively how we should be living but actually living that way is mostly impossible unless you are very strong, clever and willing to enjoy the most basic of things.  The simple truth is that even though we are born here we must pay to live here.  That&#39;s why your mother had to drop you off at daycare before the sunrise when it goes against every instinct that you both have.</p>

<p>You are not alone. Clearly we can see that by the responses in this thread. Since I was 8 years old in 2nd grade, I felt EXACTLY the way you do. In a way, it&#39;s like we are stuck in a sci-fi movie/horror film that just continues on repeat. It&#39;s like we know something is off but could never pin point it or fix it. I too have always had an uneasy feeling and never truly felt &quot;free&quot;. Until we all start thinking like this in HUGE numbers, nothing will change. But I do see more &amp; more people waking up and realizing this stuff. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I live in the Midwest. A man in New York gave a man here some numbers, and that man gave those numbers to some of my neighbors who then built me a house. In exchange for living in this house I give some numbers to yet another man, who in turn gives numbers back to a man in New York. All for a house that my neighbors built for me using materials found around here. The man in New York will never know any of us here in the Midwest, yet we choose to serve each other by serving him.</p>

<p>The desperate need to accumulate these numbers to get a house just to have shelter from the winter drives people to send their children away during the day to be raised by others, taught by others, and indoctrinated into this system by others. All to make numbers to send to men in New York.</p>

<p>This is the expected state of existence. We all live inside of an artificial system built to serve a very few number of people. We have the illusion of choice, but nobody ever truly escapes the system. The system needs millions of complacent workers afraid for their shelter and food because otherwise the men in New York wouldn&#39;t live with obscene wealth, and it will drive the workers to work using whatever method works at the time. The method has been many unethical things over the course of history, whether threat of violence or threat of starvation.</p>

<p>You are not crazy my friend. The people who never look at this and see it for what it is are the crazy ones.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We all know that feel man. Always remember though, just like the yin and yang; for all the evil that goes on in the world there&#39;s an equal and opposite positive side that goes largely unnoticed. The positive is in people who understand things like compassion and empathy and try to lift others up instead of bringing them down. The tyrants make it seem as though they have us under their thumb, but the good will always shine through no matter what they do to us. Just like plants growing up from underneath a sidewalk, the beauty of life will always exist somehow. One way to fight them is to just not listen to their bs and do whatever it is that makes you feel alive.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I love the OP and the comments/replies to it. I have to ask this because it is relevant and necessary to further the vision. What sort of system can be put in place for people to really begin to join together? Also, what sorts of systems are already in place to frustrate efforts to join together to become an alternative to the present system? We know that there are shills to try to intimidate but what about segmentation? Are there algorithms in place to limit or throttle communication to limit growth and momentum?  I ask these things because I am older and simply do not have the knowledge to poke around the cyber world and understand it&#39;s scaling and it&#39;s vulnerabilities. </p>

<p>Imagine that you all are in a vast ocean. You are spread apart long distances, treading water. Now imagine that there is a large, infinitely long floating rope that can support you and can also allow you to communicate with each other. In reality, there are those of you that can join together to design that virtual rope for the rest to join. It is there that you can all decide to put yourselves on the same side of the rope and begin paddling together toward the vision that you seek. This will afford opportunity for chance for everyone who seeks it.  <em>But remember</em>, this &quot;rope&#39;s&quot; design must have, at its very core, the ability to thwart any efforts to segment it in any way. This segmenting threat could be digital or it could be by planting divisive seeds to create infighting. </p>

This isnt the type of world we need. We dont need everybody to learn the same things at the similar pace as everyone else. Not everyone needs to learn chemistry or calculus. Our history classes have been corrupted, teaching us what they want us to memorize. Work like zombies for dozens of hours a week making someone else richer.

People&#39;s views and motivations are sometimes completely contrary to our own. My own thought is that sociopaths have an easy time rising to positions of power because they are completely disingenuous and self-centered. Also &quot;we the people&quot;  are often people who are easily duped and frankly, share the selfish ideas of their rulers. As much as we would like it to be otherwise, emotional potent over-simplifications are the effective means of swaying opinion and policy.  </p>
