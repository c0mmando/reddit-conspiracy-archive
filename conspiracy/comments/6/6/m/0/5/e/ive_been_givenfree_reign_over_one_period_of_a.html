       Basically, as resident conspiracy theorist in a my Government class, my teacher has gotten irritated with the tangents I take the class on and has offered me the opportunity to have one 42 minute class period to do whatever I would like with. I think my main topics are going to be the banking cabal (Rothschild's etc.) nd Zionism. If anyone has any ideas for other topics of conversation, access to resources, out tips for engaging a high school class on this topic I would very much appreciate it. Let's open some eyes!
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: I'm looking for things that show, in a simple manner, how their government (as that is the class) shows the illusion of choice and who truely drives policy

       If not that, then I would choose to get into as much detail about the federal reserve act of 1913 as time permits. The who, what, when, where, how and why of it and its short and long term effects to the United States and the world as a whole.

       You might lose some people with Zionism and get labeled a racist or something stupid. I'd go with getting people to think about why the pope and the Vatican have such strong influences over American politics, and slowly reveal the fact that the Vatican is the Holy Roman Empire and show people how we're still ruled by Rome.

       I live in a relatively...close minded... Area, so I'm not too worried about about the racism thing (not that I'd care anyways, I'll never see these people again after two months from now)... The area is pretty roman catholic so I'd actually be more worried about the Vatican than Zionism

       ^ I second this. Make sure you mention why does DC look like Rome, and why are so much Roman symbols inside the buildings. Then, you can bring up why are there

       I wish the Tri-Sovereign States was more common knowledge. To me that's one thing that if people knew about it- it'd finally make everyone question

       Yup! That was the rabbit hole for me. All down hill (in a good way) from there. Just imagine that? Imagine if it's actually true, and they've kept this all a secret for all this time. How the fuck would the rest of the US take that? It certainly has completely changed my view of the Us. Almost to the point of ex-patting.

       So far I haven't seen any reason to believe that it isn't all true. It's all laid bare in front of us, hiding in plain sight. The whole world thinks the pope is just some sweet old man and have no idea he's the first Jesuit pope.. it's fucking crazy. All the pedo stuff recently lead back to Rome, Trump leads back to Rome, every damn thing we talk about here leads back to Rome on a long enough timeline. I hope I live to see the day that someone more public than we are comes out with the info and asks what the fuck is going on.

       Nice, I was unaware of that. Hate to go off topic, but I know you been looking into more Eastern European things, on which topics have you been going down? I've been look more into coats of arms, and think I may have come across something very interesting. I'm coining the Eastern cabal like the Black nobility has been coined. Not ready to give out too much, but was just curious...

       If you want to go with the Rothschilds, the older info has quite strong sourcing. One topic to consider is how academia in the US was influenced by Opium money.
      </p>
      <p>
       On the one hand, you have David Sassoon who was given a monopoly for opium sales to China. The Rothschilds helped to arrange the monopoly for him as financiers to the East, shareholders to the East India Company, and close associates of the Royal Family.
      </p>
      <p>
       David Sassoon's heir then married into the Rothschilds family uniting their fortunes. He was said to be the world's richest man, thanks to the monopoly created by the Rothschilds for him. He took only Jewish lieutenants and they became very wealthy and powerful.
      </p>
      <p>
       An idea of how powerful can be seen in the set up. The Rothschild's are at the apex, and below, David Sassoon carrying out the trade, using people like Russell and Co to run the opium.
      </p>
      <p>
       The CEO of Russell and Co was the grandfather of Theodore Roosevelt. The main guys at Russell and Co helped fund ivy league schools.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Also, it wasn’t just England involved; many Americans in New England also made their fortunes in the opium trade after the slave trade was outlawed. For example, Franklin Roosevelt’s grandfather, Delano, made most of the family fortune in the Chinese opium trade.
       </p>
       <p>
        He was not alone. Many of the wealthy New England families built their fortunes on slave and opium trading. In fact, most of the American Ivy League universities were funded to a great degree when dirty money from the slave and opium trade was washed and then use to build new reputations for these families.
       </p>
       <p>
        For example, John Cleve Green donated much of his opium profits to Princeton University, Abiel Abbott Low used his opium fortune to finance the construction of Colombia University, John Murray Forbes financed the Bell Telephone Company, Joseph Coolidge’s son organized the United Fruit Company and his grandson was the founding executive officer of the Anglo-American Council on Foreign Relations. This is just the tip of the iceberg in showing how many among the power elite made their fortunes with the China opium trade.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       If you think of it from the perspective of the Triads, who were the local Chinese agents for the Western opium traders, the head of the triad would be the Rothschilds, David Sassoon would be the public faces, and Russel and Co the capos, and the Chinese Triads the underlings.
      </p>
      <p>
       From this, we have things like the Skull &amp; Bones, founded by the cousin of the CEO of Russell and Co., which of course spawned many leading members of the media, intelligence agencies (Angleton) and government (Bush and Kerry).
      </p>
      <p>
       From the opium war group, you can find research quite deeply.

       I think it's important to stress the mass mind control and propaganda laws that were passed after ww2, but repealed by Obama.  History is written to reflect the narrative and there's no law to stop them, which means they can lie about GMOs, vaccines, and anything else they want.

       Dr. Marcia Angell, a physician and longtime Editor in Chief of the New England Medical Journal (NEMJ), which is considered to another one of the most prestigious peer-reviewed medical journals in the world, makes her view of the subject quite plain:
      </p>
      <p>
       “It is simply no longer possible to believe much of the clinical research that is published, or to rely on the judgment of trusted physicians or authoritative medical guidelines. I take no pleasure in this conclusion, which I reached slowly and reluctantly over my two decades as an editor of the New England Journal of Medicine”

       It's an often overlooked topic but I've got a really great idea. The government has so successfully covered this up in the media that nobody talks about it anymore. You ask kids or even adults today about this and they have no idea what you're talking about. You need to get the word out son, you need to get the word out about Roswell.

       9/11.  It's about the most blatant, obvious provable lie ever.  You can calculate the minimum time for a buidling that height with uniform weight distribution to fall, assuming no air resistance and that the building was made like a house of cards and the lower floors provided no resistance at all to the upper floors falling on them, etc, and you get around 40s, vs the 9s for one and 11s for the other as seen on TV.  Be careful to take into account conservation of momentum.  When the upper 10 floors pick up an 11th, that 11th is not moving yet, and the total momentum of all 11 needs to stay constant, which means that 9-10% of the speed the upper 10 floors were falling is lost at the instant an 11th floor was picked up. (for the instant of collision, there is a steady rate of increase from gravity).  This of course applies to every floor.
      </p>
      <p>
       Pure freefall from the top floor with no air resistance would be closer to what was seen, because it
       <strong>
        is
       </strong>
       what was seen.  The interior and the lower floors were actually started on their way down first as part of a controlled demolition.

       In reality, the mass of the building was not uniformly distributed - there were 3 vertical sections with the strongest and heaviest section on the bottom made to support more weight and the lightest section on top, so really the collapse should have taken several minutes as a minimum.  And of course there was more structural integrity than a soap bubble, making the idea that it wasn't a controlled demolition even more ridiculous.

       Another great thing to cover, which people seem to be more open to, is JFK.  It's not just the CIA involved, there was a meeting of 20 people who met for coordinating this at a hotel the night before, including the heads of several mafias, some major corporations including Ford, and Lyndon Johnson, Richard Nixon, and George H. W. Bush who went on to become president after him.   Must see documentary on this:

       Hah please don't use any of your ideas. You'll come off sounding like Alex Jones and people will dismiss you.

       You could easily spend 40 minutes about 9-11. Which has legit facts.
