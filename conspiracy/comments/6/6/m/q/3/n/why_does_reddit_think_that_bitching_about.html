That&#39;s not to say they don&#39;t have skin in the game, they do, no doubt many of our real identities are stored in databases like the alleged (I doubt the name aspect, not the database concept itself) &#39;Main Core&#39; for online civil disobedience/viewing classified information/disseminating classified information/a whole other litany of misdemeanors &amp; felonies most people are unaware of before it is too late.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can think of a few reasons this is anything but futile:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>arguing with others is the best way to challenge your own views and see if they hold up</p></li>
<li><p>arguing is a great way to learn new things</p></li>
<li><p>arguing is a great way to learn humility and control</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I could go on, but I&#39;ll just sum up with this. I&#39;ve been arguing politics online since my early 20s when I was pretty left leaning - perhaps even a socialist. Now, in my 30s, I&#39;d say I most closely identify as a consequentialist libertarian - quite the shift. I could not have accomplished this without challenging my views against others and reflecting on the results. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Seriously? I literally told you what I&#39;ve accomplished: a complete change in my political ideals, a wealth of new knowledge, and encounters with humility. I don&#39;t necessarily mean arguing like a violent domestic dispute.

    <div class="md"><p>Another important lesson is to learn to discover when someone&#39;s simply ignoring your argument and restating theirs, or is more interested in the act of arguing than actually being correct.

    <div class="md"><p>Bitching, AKA rants, are one thing. WHat I don&#39;t get is getting into a discussion with someone in order to sway their position. Spending 30 minutes- and hour writing one response o many responses, citing/linking sources, formatting and proof reading to get a well presented easily confirmed argument. </p>

<p>99.999999% of the time that effort, time, energy is wasted. The person is not going to change their opinion/position. And many times it just ends up with them calling you an idiot and no responding any further.  </p>

<p>Spending time to convince nameless, faceless, words on the screen, I have learned, is a total waste of time. It pays nothing. The only benefit is if someone says you changed thier position, you might get a warm fuzzy feeling.  </p>
