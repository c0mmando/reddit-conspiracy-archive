       I get the feeling that a lot of people on here are 'winning' or 'doing something about our current situation' because they create posts or comments against politics.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's just like. . . . .  Politicians still do whatever they want. Nobody gives a flying fuck about your opinion and it's not changing anything.  But people think they're winning?

       I'm seeing it mentioned more. Like right now. The one good thing about such a blatantly corrupted system. It brings people to this point. We start to see past the divisions and realize we're all in the same cage.

       While there is certainly the avenue of spreading information and networking, IMO, it is fearful hope, as in hopefully by speaking out online they won't have to be out in the weather protesting/rioting while being pummeled by the police or other
       <em>
        authorized personnel
       </em>
       .  That's not to say they don't have skin in the game, they do, no doubt many of our real identities are stored in databases like the alleged (I doubt the name aspect, not the database concept itself) 'Main Core' for online civil disobedience/viewing classified information/disseminating classified information/a whole other litany of misdemeanors &amp; felonies most people are unaware of before it is too late.

       I can think of a few reasons this is anything but futile:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         arguing with others is the best way to challenge your own views and see if they hold up
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         arguing is a great way to learn new things
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         arguing is a great way to learn humility and control
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       I could go on, but I'll just sum up with this. I've been arguing politics online since my early 20s when I was pretty left leaning - perhaps even a socialist. Now, in my 30s, I'd say I most closely identify as a consequentialist libertarian - quite the shift. I could not have accomplished this without challenging my views against others and reflecting on the results.

       Seriously? I literally told you what I've accomplished: a complete change in my political ideals, a wealth of new knowledge, and encounters with humility. I don't necessarily mean arguing like a violent domestic dispute. The most constructive arguments
       <em>
        are
       </em>
       civil discussions, which is something else you'll learn after you the argue the wrong way enough.

       You're assuming you're correct. Argue the wrong way? That speaks of arrogance more than wisdom.

       Another important lesson is to learn to discover when someone's simply ignoring your argument and restating theirs, or is more interested in the act of arguing than actually being correct. For example, this conversation. The best thing you can do is ignore that person, which I'll be doing now.

       I think we need framework of a better running system before we overthrow one that is just competing with another. Universally speaking we could take down this government, or that government, or those pesky powers that be, but the reality is we can't agree on shit because we argue about how things should be ran.

       This is the source of the issue in American democracy today. Until everyone in the world agrees war is some primitive animal resolution method we can't get anywhere without destroying one another for resources. And that's just the start.

       Bitching, AKA rants, are one thing. WHat I don't get is getting into a discussion with someone in order to sway their position. Spending 30 minutes- and hour writing one response o many responses, citing/linking sources, formatting and proof reading to get a well presented easily confirmed argument.
      </p>
      <p>
       99.999999% of the time that effort, time, energy is wasted. The person is not going to change their opinion/position. And many times it just ends up with them calling you an idiot and no responding any further.
      </p>
      <p>
       Spending time to convince nameless, faceless, words on the screen, I have learned, is a total waste of time. It pays nothing. The only benefit is if someone says you changed thier position, you might get a warm fuzzy feeling.
