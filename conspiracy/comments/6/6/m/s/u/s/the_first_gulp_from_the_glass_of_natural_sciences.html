    <div class="md"><p>Science is a way for people to explain something they don&#39;t understand.</p>

<p>We have two theories of gravity, because neither works and we have to switch them depending on circumstances. Based on our theories of gravity, 95% of our universe is dark matter.</p>

<p>So either science is 95% wrong, or knows virtually nothing about 95% of our universe. And this is just about gravity, something as simply as what goes up must come down.</p>

<p>The scientific method is great, but the religion of science sucks. Other religions have many more answers, when you actually look and experiment for yourself.</p>

<p>But absence is the evidence of absence.</p>

<p>Where is your god? What has it done? If your god does not demonstrate its presence, then whether it exists or not is immaterial - it has no affect on me, you or anything else in the universe (hence the absence of evidence) and thus is non-existent in practical terms.</p>

<p>The easier question is where is the devil, and what has it done?</p>

<p>Turn on the news and look at the Syrian kid covered in rubble and blood, so that some banking royalty in Europe could buy energy from Qatar a few cents cheaper than buying it from Russia. Just greed?</p>

<p>Then look at all the robed kid fuckers at Bohemian Grove dancing around a giant owl. That&#39;s not just for fun.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>God&#39;s not a man in the clouds, God generally leaves the world to free will. The devil(s) are more hands on, hence why the world sucks.</p>

<p>But putting that aside, if people believe there is an afterlife, their behavior in this world will be different. So just believing there&#39;s a judge sitting over you, doing nothing for now, but doing something later, can have material effects on this world.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Science has a model for gravity. Well, actually two models, because they don&#39;t work correctly, so we sometimes switch them around. And then when we test them, we find they are way, way off. How far off? Well, currently scientists think 5% of the universe is baryonic matter (stuff we can see and touch) and 95% is dark matter/energy.</p>

<p>So, either science is 95% off in terms of understanding something as basic as why something that goes up must come down, or science knows virtually nothing about 95% of the stuff around us.</p>

<p>You know how 98% of scientists agree with climate change? The part they don&#39;t tell you is none of them have a consensus as to how much of the change is natural vs man made, in fact they can&#39;t even agree whether the earth is naturally cooling or warming.</p>

<p>Speaking of 98%, remember all the statisticians telling us Clinton was going to win?</p>

<p>The scientific method is solid, but science has been pushed as a religion and scientists (or the politicians, corporations, and media who pay their salary and report their results) are the new priests.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First of all, just to be clear, I have no trouble with the definition of the word &#39;evidence,&#39; so help yourself to tone down the condescension.  What you and so many others who make claim that there is &quot;no&quot; evidence fail to understand is that your rejection of the evidence, on whatever grounds, does not mean the evidence is not evidence.  As far as evidence goes, there is no shortage of arguments for the existence of God.  Some of the classics are Anselm&#39;s Ontological Argument and the Kalam Cosmological Argument.  More recently there&#39;s the argument from Fine Tuning and Alvin Plantinga&#39;s modern take on the Ontological Argument.  Feel free to explore these arguments as you like.  Regardless of your verdict you&#39;ll do well to note that the arguments themselves couldn&#39;t be arguments at all if they didn&#39;t start by first presenting <em>evidence</em>.  Furthermore, the entirety of both the Old Testament and the New Testament is evidence supporting the existence of God; evidence you and so many others reject.  But my point in all of this is, again, that your rejection of the evidence doesn&#39;t mean it isn&#39;t evidence.  If you&#39;re really as interested in reading over evidence as you say (I have my doubts as to your sincerity) then here are a couple <a href="http://www.reasonablefaith.org/popular-articles-does-god-exist">in depth</a> <a href="https://beliefmap.org/god-exists/#first-cause">starting points</a>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was not being condescending, but rather you were accusing me of rejecting non existing evidence and I was in turn defending myself.</p>

<p>I did look into Kalam Cosmological Argument and the Anselm&#39;s Ontological Argument. But ultimately they are both arguments because they cannot be proven, otherwise they would be known as &#39;facts&#39; instead of arguments. I can &#39;argue&#39; that dragons still exist basing my evidence on dinosaur print fossils alas that does not make it a fact.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Furthermore, the entirety of both the Old Testament and the New Testament is evidence supporting the existence of God</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That book of &quot;evidence&quot; also says that an assortment of creatures such as Leviathan, The Dragon, The Behemoth, and (Job 39:9–12) Unicorns. So the evidence you provide is tainted and not admissible.</p>

<p>Furthermore the bible is no more evidence that god exists any more than the Egyptian &#39;Book of the Dead&#39; is proof of Ra, or the Harry Potter series proof of magic exists.</p>

<p>So apart from the book itself being &#39;evidence&#39;, what else you got? I am honestly interested in reviewing it! I am always open to new perspectives and views so long as they are backed up by solid evidence and proofs.</p>

<p>&quot;So the evidence you provide is tainted and not admissible.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;So the evidence you provide.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;evidence&quot;</p>

<p>So have I provided evidence or is there no evidence?  Which is it?</p>

<p>Again, since you&#39;re still not getting it, your rejection of the evidence doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s not evidence.  Say there&#39;s no satisfactory evidence.  Say there&#39;s no evidence that you personally find convincing.  But you can&#39;t say there&#39;s no evidence.</p>

<p>&quot;The claim that there is no supporting evidence for the existence of God is obviously false.&quot; - me, first post in this thread, yesterday</p>

<p>All of the definitions of god that I gave are what I would call sub-gods, some of them are evil and may be seen as devils or demons. The super-god is the connection of all matter, energy, and thought. It is everything. Christians call it the Holy Spirit/Host/Ghost in the holy trinity. Sikhs consider it the real god. Others call it Indra&#39;s Net. Science calls it the hologram/simulation universe and quantum entanglement.</p>

<p>We are here to sort out or balance this cosmic schizophrenia into something that makes sense. We are here to create meaning, because meaning cannot exist eithout time.</p>

<p>Where God is from, time is irrelevant. </p>

<p>In other words, we are God&#39;s avatars in a holographic universe that is his mind. Our actions are his thoights as he sorrs out the meaning behind his own existence.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You nailed it. God is infinite, that means not just infinitely good but also infinitely evil. God created sub-gods to manage this little experiment we call the physical universe. Like people, some of those sub-gods are good, some are bad (Satan), and some are both.</p>

<p>I believe the point is to solve this problem: how does an infinite god stop being evil. So you setup an experiment (our multiverse) to find the solution, and then you iterate through a process to reach that solution. The solution is likely that god can&#39;t stop being evil, but it can quarantine that evil to have a good and bad side. You can call these heaven and hell. Our little experiment called life is a sorting algorithm to identify and separate evil into what we call hell.</p>

<p>From your research do you believe god (and Satan) to be real? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t know how people can ask this question, because it&#39;s meaningless.</p>

<p>First of all, everyone has a different concept of what the word &quot;God&quot; means. For some, it&#39;s a universal intelligence. For others, it&#39;s Jesus. For others, it&#39;s an old man with a white beard. For others, it&#39;s the Yahweh of the Old Testiment. And so on, and so on. That&#39;s the first point.</p>

<p>Secondly, all of our concepts of God are only limited models that attempt to describe something that is far beyond human comprehension. My understanding of God is wrong, your understanding of God is wrong, everyone&#39;s understanding of God is wrong, because <em>we cannot understand God</em>.</p>

<p>Now if you asked if I believe there is some intelligent purpose behind the existence and design of life in the universe, I would answer &quot;yes&quot;. It seems absurdly simplistic to believe that life simply started to spontaneously organize itself from inanimate matter. Call this organizing principle &quot;God&quot; if you like, but I am not so  arrogant or foolish as to believe that I understand what God is or what God&#39;s purpose is.</p>

<p>I&#39;m open to there being some kind of creator, but the Christian bible is a silly story that isn&#39;t even internally cohesive. Basically everything in it was just taken from previous religions. </p>

<p>I would be just as likely to believe in the Pantheon of ancient Greece, or the Roman gods, or any other superstition from thousands of years ago. </p>

<p>There are multiple gods (or entities or whatever). The bible even says this, and old religions like Egypt/Greece/Rome said it.</p>

<p>Some of the internal inconsistency is because when you say &quot;god&quot; you could be talking about opposing forces, Baal, Moloch, Yahweh, whatever. So &quot;god&quot; could tell Abraham to kill his son and then &quot;god&quot; could tell him to stop, because the first god could be Moloch and the second god Yahweh.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nah it&#39;s not, you don&#39;t have to fully understand the science behind it, just kinda get little pieces of everything and over time you&#39;ll fill in the blanks </p>

<p>just start small, figure out what that flower circle shit looking thing is</p>

<p>Look into quantum physics and see what particle duality is and try to wrap your head around it and see it =/= common sense , you have to open your mind, be open to all information, don&#39;t be in a rush to make a decision, the more information you have, the more your mind can crossreference, the better. </p>

<p>Like I posted that post on holofractal, yte I don&#39;t know shit about any of that stuff. But little by little I pick up, read a little about kaballah one day here, a little about this one day there, etc </p>

<p>Same with cryptocurrency , started off 1 month ago knowing nothing bought some eth, now I am diversified into 40+ coins (small amount of money but still) , learned / performed 100+ trades back and forth, learning day trading + analysis, participated in ICO&#39;s , etc . pretty cool </p>

<p>First they got us to worship their gods. Then they obfuscated their gods by corrupting religion into a control mechanism. When that started failing, they pushed the religion of science and atheism.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I had a thought earlier that religion in general has been warped into a tool used to stop people from investigating phenomena and instead attribute it to &quot;god&quot; or &quot;angels&quot;.</p>

<p>In other words it&#39;s a way to snub critical thinking.</p>

<p>I was on imgur earlier, and there was an image dump of &quot;things I used to believe as a kid&quot;. One of them went along the lines of &quot;when I was a kid, when I flew in a plane I would hear the baggage bumping around, but I thought it was angels bumping into the plane&quot;.</p>

<p>I was raised in a christian family, and I noticed my mind would always jump to attribute things to supernatural phenomena before even attempting to explain it using natural phenomena. It always made me feel dumb when I looked further and found the true cause.</p>

<p>I think that all religions are mostly wrong and only have a few fragments of truth in them. I&#39;m open to the idea of an afterlife or reincarnation, especially after reading <a href="http://www.galactanet.com/oneoff/theegg_mod.html">this</a>, however there&#39;s so much corruption in any religion that I would never think one is more correct than any other.</p>

<p>The first time I questioned it was when I read in the bible that the jews are god&#39;s &quot;chosen people&quot;. I then had the thought that maybe the bible is a kind of guide for a certain Zionist group to gain power, specifically the book of revelations. Things that led me to this conclusion would include reading that &quot;half of all people born will be autistic by 2025&quot; and linking that to how people say slave workers would be used in a depopulation scenario. Autistic individuals are supposed to be poor at communication and good at repetitive tasks. It&#39;s a great way to stop any sort of uprising from their slaves.</p>

<p>Depopulation of most of the earth&#39;s individuals is a relatively popular theory, which just so happens to be a major part of how the world is supposed to end. You know, the 4 horseman? Plagues, Famine, War and Conquest. </p>

<p>Gosh there&#39;s alot of stuff to write, I need to make a post about this.</p>

<p>Anyway, sorry for the tangent. To sum it up, I think any religion or spirituality that may have been mostly correct at one point has been warped as a tool to control any individual&#39;s basic thought process.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Most Jews are actually Jewish, they worship Yahweh. Now maybe Yahweh is actually Baal or the demiurge and they&#39;re accidentally worshiping something evil, but then you could say the same about Christians worshiping &quot;God the father&quot; as part of the holy trinity.</p>

<p>It&#39;s the Luciferians and Satanists who are deliberately worshiping evil and pretending to be Jews (and Catholics, and...), they&#39;re the problem. The guy running the local Jewish deli is unlikely to be a Satanist. I think this is what you&#39;re saying, not that all Jews are Satanists.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was a lifelong atheist who fell into this rabbit hole and finally had to ask myself a question:</p>

<p>Why is there overwhelming evidence that the elite are worshiping something meta-physical and apparently evil? Bohemian Grove, Epstein&#39;s pagan temple, pedo rape, false flags and the following wars.</p>

<p>And then I went looking for the answer. I went looking for evil. And I found it. I met the devil that these people worship (actually two of them). These people, and the things they worship, are pure fucking evil. One of the devils showed me the hell that awaits for them.</p>

<p>But in the process, I found god, heaven, and the meaning of life. It&#39;s not a guy in the clouds, god is the interconnection of everything, all matter, energy, people, and thought. You&#39;ll see a lot of people on this thread have come to the same conclusion. I&#39;ll make another post about the meaning of life.</p>

<p>Speaking of people coming to the same conclusion, when I hear David Icke talk about reptilians, or Alex Jones talk about psychic vampires and interdimensional aliens, or a priest talk about angels and demons, or Archons, I get it. These are all imperfect ways of describing the same meta-physical/interdimensional entities.</p>

<p>I wish this post was stickied, permanently, or at least upvoted to the front. This is the biggest and most important red pill on our journey down the rabbit hole. It tells us why everything is happening and gives an idea what comes next. It requires you to accept the limitations of your mind and to kill your ego, to admit you are likely wrong about everything you know, and to go looking for the truth, with no preconceived notions or restraints. When you do this, you discover everything. Oh, and then remember to ground yourself, you still need to eat and breathe and stuff, as mundane as it seems.</p>

<p>TLDR God and the devil are real, go find them yourself to find the truth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not here to abuse atheists. (although it can be fun). More just to see if anyone has turned more religious after conspiracy type research. I wa personally more agnostic yet my reading has led me to think god and Satan are real, and TPTB may want u to think otherwise   </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Where is your god? What has it done?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The easier question is where is the devil, and what has it done?</p>

<p>Turn on the news and look at the Syrian kid covered in rubble and blood, so that some banking royalty in Europe could buy energy from Qatar a few cents cheaper than buying it from Russia. Just greed?</p>

<p>Then look at all the robed kid fuckers at Bohemian Grove dancing around a giant owl. That&#39;s not just for fun.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If your god does not demonstrate its presence, then whether it exists or not is immaterial - it has no affect on me, you or anything else in the universe</p>
</blockquote>

<p>God&#39;s not a man in the clouds, God generally leaves the world to free will. The devil(s) are more hands on, hence why the world sucks.</p>

<p>But putting that aside, if people believe there is an afterlife, their behavior in this world will be different. So just believing there&#39;s a judge sitting over you, doing nothing for now, but doing something later, can have material effects on this world.</p>
