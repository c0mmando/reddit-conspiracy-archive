       It sounds like you don't understand the complicated problems with Venezuela economy.  You act like US will turn into Venezuela overnight just because people want socialized healthcare meanwhile you ignore all the other first world countries where it is successfully implemented.

       Alright, listen up. First of all, Socialism is not sustainable (ie. PIGS nations) in the long run. 2nd of all, the combined population of Norway, Finland, and Sweden = 20 million people. There are ~5 million (homogeneous) people in Norway.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, lets look at the population of the US (
       <strong>
        318 million
       </strong>
       - non-homogeneous) people. Put beside the fact that Socialism always fails over time, how in the ever fuck would think that could remotely be possible in a nation as large as the US with a such diverse population?
      </p>
      <p>
       When people are homogeneous, they have a sense of culture and a tribal mentality. They are more likely to help one another. We, in the US don't. I don't want to pay for the libtards shit, nor do I want the government getting more money, bigger, and having more power.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look at what the ass-hats in DC are doing now... You want more of that? Because that's exactly how you get more of it. We do not have a Republic no longer and we sure as shit do not have Free Market Capitalism, we have crony Capitalism (damn near Fascism).

       What is even funnier is that the leftists want to lower the wages of the working class not only in America, but also in Scandanavian countries via mass immigration.
      </p>

       If you want a first world paradise like Sweden or Norway - you have to have a first world population.

       I am, since the position you chose to argue against and mock is not a real position held by any majority of "leftists," and is thus a straw man argument because it is representative of the real positions of those you are arguing against.

       The US
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       engaged in an economic war against Venezuela, Russia, and Iran. These are large oil and natural gas producers, so the US has made efforts to lower oil prices to hurt these economies.
      </p>
      <p>
       The US also supports the Venezuelan opposition, even attempting coups at various points. They are using economic weapons to prevent a large union of leftist countries (Venezuela, Bolivia, Brazil, Argentina, Ecuador, Paraguay, others) from dominating South America and pushing the US out.
      </p>
      <p>
       Stop believing capitalist propaganda. Big rich countries like Venezuela don't "run out" of food. The US does everything possible to tighten the economic screws on leftist countries, then blames the resulting famine on socialism, rather than their sabotage attempts.

       Right, capitalists. They want to plunder the planet of every last resource. Anti-capitalists try to prevent that, and get slaughtered. The US has supported death squads in Latin America for decades.

       Think about how scummy you sound, mocking people for being victims of the death squads you sent to disappear their union organizers. The US has shattered so many lives.

       You're missing the point, and it's quite funny if it wasn't so sad. What you think is Capitalism, is not Capitalism. What you think you know and your ideology, is not, and one in the same. It's authoritarianism. You cannot have Socialism without Authoritarians who rule over you. We do not, nor have we really every had Capitalism in the US. So yes, both have had death squads. You're just defending one death squad over the other....

       Northern Europe has the happiest citizens anywhere, and their suicide rates are lower than in capitalist Alaska which is at the same latitude. If you want happy citizens, you want socialism. Not capitalist death squads or Stalinist death squads. You want Danish socialist schools and hospitals.
