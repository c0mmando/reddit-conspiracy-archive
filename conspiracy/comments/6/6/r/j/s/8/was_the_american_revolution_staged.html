<p>But what if, in order to prevent further revolt, the crown staged a &quot;successful&quot; revolt? 
People will stop fighting for something if they think they&#39;ve obtained it. Aren&#39;t almost all of the US Presidents related? Descendants of King John of England?</p>

<p>What if the fake liberation doesn&#39;t just stop there? What if every country ever &quot;owned&quot; by the Roman Empire is still part of the same Empire, connected through their banking system? (Even the Vatican has it&#39;s own bank...)</p>

<p>People tend not to suspect a dead man of wrong doing. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the whole story of the Founding Fathers, British Tyranny, and the Revolutionary War is filled with a lot of mythology.</p>

<p>Libertarians are critical of U.S. politicians all throughout America&#39;s history, but show reverence for the Founding Fathers, as if these guys were &quot;saints&quot;. They weren&#39;t. They were self-serving; just like politicians are today.</p>

<p>Rothschild&#39;s Blueprint was put into action in 1773, and the Revolutionary War began 1775. King George owned the American Colonies, and with the defeat of the British, he lost America and all of its natural resources and the newly formed United States ended up in the hands of the financiers and bankers of Europe. </p>

<p>The clue is in their name: Founding Fathers. They are primary characters in the Foundation Myth of America. There&#39;s little difference between Washington and, for example, Horus, who led his people to freedom from Set&#39;s tyranny, except that Washington hasn&#39;t been officially deified yet.</p>

<p>Take what you know about American history, and how you learned it, and go and read the Bible. Notice any similarities? Moses and Aaron freed the Israelites from bondage and Joshua led them to conquest, just as the Founding Fathers freed America from British oppression, gave Americans their law-code and set out West. Did you happen to notice that while they differ in detail the US Constitution and the Book of Leviticus are functionally the same thing, documents setting out the nation&#39;s code of laws? The Bible is a lot like a high school essay on American history written from memory. By the time you have to compose that essay, you&#39;ve already had all of those stories drummed into you since before you could write.</p>

<p>I maintain that ever major war is a false-flag, by which the hidden hand/Cabal, in it&#39;s manifestations over the centuries, continually provokes war between two sides so they may reap the rewards (and reduce the population).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, the people and circumstances of the time were very unique. Something we&#39;re unlikely to ever see again. It would be unproductive to suggest it were fake, or otherwise discredit something that has so much written text regarding it taking place.</p>

<p>We&#39;re taught shitty history in school, some historians have biases or collective dogma, but The American Revolution has ample reading material aside from that--once you dismiss the idea of hero worship.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As Putin said, Tri-Sovereign States. And you&#39;re closer to the truth than you may think- talking about the Vatican and its bank. The thing that is often left out is that this world bank we&#39;re all aware of in r/conspiracy.. <em>it&#39;s The Vatican</em>. Nearly everything the US and its allies do is in the name of The Vatican and installing world banks in countries that don&#39;t have them.</p>

<p>The Vatican, I believe, was heavily funding both sides of the &quot;American revolution&quot;- if we&#39;re to assume there was one, and our country&#39;s capital is literally Vatican property. It&#39;s not even part of our country. Vatican has been playing 4D chess on the world stage for a <em>very</em> long time.</p>
