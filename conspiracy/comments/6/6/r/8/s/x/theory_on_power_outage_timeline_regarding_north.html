        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>April 14, 2017 - North Korea broadcasts encrypted radio message.</p>

<p>April 19, 2017 - Operation &quot;Gotham Shield&quot; announced for April 25.</p>

<p>April 20/21, 2017 - Multiple power outages in major cities. LA/20th, SF &amp; NYC/21st</p>

<p>Theory: North Korean broadcast was instructing agents to implement plan to strike power grid.</p>

<p>NSA had already run decryption and knew what was planned, or CIA had already &quot;turned&quot; NK agent and were informed.</p>

<p>To avoid panicking the public, government announces &quot;Gotham Shield&quot; for April 25th, the day they expect attack.</p>

<p>North Korean agents then move their timeline up, which would be a standard protocol if operation was compromised. Edit: It could also affect the synchronization of the attack, causing it to become sporadic.</p>

<p>If the media treats this like an internal infrastructure issue, that should raise an eyebrow or two. Edit: It&#39;s been brought to my attention by u/ansultares that as we all know, our infrastructure is in need of upgrade and this very well could explain it. But also - Three cities...same day? LA happened yesterday..here is best source I could find:</p>

<p>Thursday, April 20, 2017 11:23PM</p>

<p>Power was knocked out at part of the Port of Long Beach Thursday evening, stranding hundreds of trucks for hours.</p>

<p>Southern California Edison initially reported it was caused by metallic balloons coming in contact with wires. The utility later corrected that statement, saying there was a different outage in Long Beach that was caused by balloons. The agency is still investigating the cause of the outage at the port.</p>

<p>The Port of Long Beach is the nation&#39;s second-busiest container port, right behind the Port of Los Angeles. It handles some 82 million metric tons of cargo every year.</p>

<p>(u/Glitchypink made comment regarding what could be accomplished &quot;during&quot; power outage, like the power outage that happened weekend prior to 9/11. This port outage is perfect example of possibilities imo.)</p>

<p>My golden rule: Always look for what&#39;s &quot;not&quot; being reported.</p>

<p>Update: At approx. 2:00pm MST  I was given warning by PM to delete this post unless I wanted my username to become a reality. It was from u/01261947 who deleted acct. minutes after message.</p>

<p>Final edit: Solar flare event was downgraded to G1 today by NOAA.</p>

<p>I removed some parts of post because it was becoming TLDR.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>More than likely they&#39;ve been doing that to important military infrastructure since the cold war. EMP&#39;s aren&#39;t a new threat and they would&#39;ve wanted to harden places like air bases, aircraft, missile silos and power generation facilities critical systems in case of nuclear war.</p>

<p>They&#39;re sadistic assholes, but they love to be prepared. Any country that can recover(even partially) in the event of all out nuclear warfare would stand to conquer whats left of the world.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They dont necessarily have to use a emp. And I would have think a emp would have friend alot of civilian things.</p>

<p>Most likely just backdoored some local power plants and turned some computers off, is my guess. But it really could be anything, the biggest threat to power substations/grids is not hackers, but animal life, more squirrels have caused a power outage than anything else.</p>

<p>But 3 different places around the same time, sounds suspicious and less likely to just be coincidence...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I read up on the prince and it looks as if he may have been a Nazi Sympathizer. I wonder if his plane crash was an accident or &quot;accident.&quot;</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know anything about Sweden so I have no idea if his death was considered suspicious at the time. I&#39;ll have to do some more digging. Here&#39;s a wiki excerpt below.</p>

<p>Some recent journalists and historians portray Gustaf Adolf as sympathetic towards the Nazi movement in Germany in the 1930s, a highly debated and criticised opinion.[citation needed] As an official representative of Sweden, Gustaf Adolf met with many Nazi leaders, including Adolf Hitler and Hermann Göring (the latter had lived in Sweden and had many friends among the Swedish upper class). As the prince very rarely spoke of political matters and left no written evidence of any political sympathies of any kind, the subject remains very much a matter of speculation.</p>

<p>These rumours however made him unpopular among many Swedes during his lifetime. The public called him tyskprinsen (&quot;the German prince&quot;).[citation needed] However, according to journalist and author Staffan Skott in his book Alla dessa Bernadottar (All these Bernadottes), letters and diary entries by influential Swedes of decidedly anti-Nazi persuasion disprove the rumors. Such documents include those of the diplomat Sven Grafström and of the wife of the cabinet minister Gustav Möller, as well as of the stepson of Hermann Göring, who said that a visit by the prince to Göring&#39;s home was a complete failure and that Göring and Gustaf Adolf did not get along well. The newspaper Expressen said that &quot;plausible witnesses who were also strongly pro-democracy&quot; had denied the rumors.[citation needed] The Swedish Royal Court made a statement denying any knowledge of Nazi sympathies.[citation needed]</p>

<p>Gustaf Adolf expressed his support for Finland during the Continuation War of 1941–1944, and would even have liked to participate as a voluntary soldier in the Winter War of 1939–1940, but the King&#39;s disapproval prevented this from happening.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The entire downtown area loses power (much of downtown is still without power as of writing this) and they only flew a single news helicopter over the city. Meanwhile, they limited air traffic across the entire Bay Area for several hours all morning. According to one person I heard from they hadn&#39;t seen air traffic like this since 9/11.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, just yesterday was 4/20 in Golden Gate park in SF, and there was 3-4 news helicopters covering the event.</p>

<p>An entire section of the city in most prominent business area including the finical district loses power for 6+ hours and there&#39;s almost no news coverage. A few thousand people smoking pot and the entire media was in full force acting like the apocalypse was happening. </p>

<p>Factor in the limited air traffic and this whole situation is just bizarre. The sky has been mostly empty all day. It&#39;s very unusual for a Friday for there to be such little air traffic like this.</p>

<p>They&#39;re of course blaming everything on aging infrastructure, and a single power breaker going down.</p>

<p>On N Korea the 25, 26 and 27 are in mind the dates for action if military action is to occur. I have had these dates since early April for several reasons: Ocean currents, temperatures and conditions, moon phase and required timing logistical requirements from insertion in country of HUINT, Sp Ops, Naval and Air Forces. </p>

<p>Still a hot war in that region - even in the best scenarios- will be a loss of life - maybe a lot. So I am hedging my bets on an internal N Korean assassination of FatBoy by and through Chinese operatives. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>For what it&#39;s worth, I live very close to a major military installation and drive right past big parts of it on a daily basis. It&#39;s been very quiet for the last couple of weeks, but in the last two days we&#39;ve noticed more air and ground activity. A large number of vehicles loaded on rail cars, more equipment out, an increased number of temporary shelters and buildings, etc. Of course it could just be training or inventory, but I figured I&#39;d throw it out there. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Very plausible theory. Everyone knows the US grid is totally vulnerable to anyone with even a moderate ability to project force to the US:</p>

<p>A small group could easily take down the grid, which takes down the whole US. And the North Koreans were probably sending a message that they know this, and have enough agents capable of pulling it off.</p>

<p>Probably someone in the know in the US government. Probably a bad guy trying to cover up how easy it is the take down the regime and maintain the illusion of invulnerability. But possibly a good guy genuinely worried that someone will do it.</p>
