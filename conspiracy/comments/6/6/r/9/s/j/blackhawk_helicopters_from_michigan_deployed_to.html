        <h3 class="title">Blackhawk helicopters from Michigan deployed to Fort Hood today.</h3>
        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">67</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2017-04-21 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/ivybelle.html">ivybelle</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Cousin called me to let me know she watched 10 blackhawks flying low over her house today. She lives in a very populated area so this was kind of surprising. We do live near an air national guard base, but that base is almost entirely devoted to drone piloting now so not a lot of piloted aircraft comes from there. </p>

<p>Apparently other people were alarmed by the helicopters because the local news was forced to put out a story. Here is an excerpt:</p>

<p>&quot;After reaching out to staff with the Michigan Army National Guard, through Fort Custer, Newschannel 3 learned that 10 Blackhawk helicopters from the 1st Battalion 147th Assault Helicopter Battalion were traveling from the Army Aviation Support Facility in Grand Ledge, on their way to Fort Hood for deployment.</p>

<p>According to a release from the Michigan Army National Guard, &quot;the unit will perform a variety of missions to include, medical evacuations, air movements, supply movements, aircraft maintenance and battlefield tracking.&quot;</p>

<p>The thing is, I checked fb. Other people in town (I live in SW Michigan), noticed this activity as well and commented on it. One person had a friend mention the same thing. Then she clarified later that she saw the same thing around the same time but that she lives in Toledo. </p>

<p>This makes me think that we are mobilizing troops and assets for a reason. </p>

<p>I suspect something will be in the news in the next 12-48 hours. </p>

<p>Just a heads up. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I should add, I have an acquaintance level friend in the guard who flies blackhawks out of Grand Ledge. He was not scheduled to be deployed. I don&#39;t know if he was part of this or not, and it won&#39;t be hard to tell if he doesn&#39;t show up to work because he is also a member of the state House of Representatives. I don&#39;t know if he would be deployed due to that or not. He is a multiple tour Iraq veteran though so I don&#39;t know. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah. This is part of a deployment though. Not only did the news article state that (someone linked to it here), but a friend who is a member of the national guard and also a member of the state legislature who flies helicopters out of that base posted today about the deployment and vaguely referenced that those deployed were going in service to &quot;the war on terror.&quot; Apparently the governor was there to see them off.

    <div class="md"><p>I just wanted to comment that the person that I know that is in the guard that flies out of this base posted later today and noted that there had been a deployment to &quot;continue the war on terror.&quot; He also made an observation about how many of the people deploying aren&#39;t old enough to remember 9/11 but that was all of the information he provided. I don&#39;t think he is in the position to have operational knowledge of any real mission details however, so it&#39;s still very up in the air as to what was actually going on. </p>

<p>On the fb news article locally here, there are some people that report seeing/hearing helicopters moving over Lake Michigan in formation Thursday night around 9pm as well near South Haven. When you combine that with the comment about someone else seeing formations in Toledo, it&#39;s hard to imagine that a Blackhawk convention is just taking place at Fort Hood. Clearly some kind of preparation or actual deployment is taking place. </p>
