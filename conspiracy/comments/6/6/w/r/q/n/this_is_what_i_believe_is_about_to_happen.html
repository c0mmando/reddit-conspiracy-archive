       FBI ANON: If leaking data en mass destroys my country, we betray the country. If we do nothing, we betray the country. I am not disagreeing with you. I am saying the situation is more complicated when you are on the inside, and you do not have the breadth of info that I have that would make your eyes fall out of your skull if you knew what all was going on.

       I don't think Trump thought of the plan in entirety but, I definitely think he's smart enough to do the right thing when presented the options.

       Whats wrong with a free market and gold money?  Too many people conflate capitalism with our current cronyism.  Gold is chains for a printer-loving politician.  Middle-class can't exist in a debt-based system.  Free markets and gold money IS freedom.  Greenspan had it right when he wrote Gold and Economic Freedom back in the 60s

       Personally I think w need to go to gold back currency and anyone who makes over X amount of money should be paying back into helping others, along with a maximum wage.
      </p>

       Also limit the amount of kids people can have. The debt slave system is built on more and more people having kids so they become cogs in a debt slavery system

       Open your mind instead. What you see is not always what's truth. We will possibly never know the truth. We are merely observers and come to our own conclusions. But rest assured they're not facts. Anything is possible and we need to be open to anything and expect the unexpected.

       I respect your skepticism's, as I too am not happy with some of the choices been done so fa by him, but at the same time, are we so sure he's 100% in charge? It's his cabinet right? Maybe its not... Maybe there's alot of tension on the inside and there's a battle raging. Its possible Trump is on the evil side of things, its possible Trump is playing an act or 5D chess as some would call it. Its possible he's on another level we don't understand, and we just see him as some fat egotistical moron. But nothing is probable, and only time will tell and determine what's the more likely scenario.

       Totally! Why couldn't he put regular people into his cabinet? It's full of successful CEO's and shit. No normal people like baristas, BLM organizers, Wombyn's Equality protesters, Open border globalist's, fluid-gender study professors and the such. It's almost like he's filling those positions with people with experience and not to meet equal opportunity quota's that make people feel good.

       Fair enough. Thanks for your honest reply. I've identified as Libertarian/Democrat for most of my life. Hillary and the DNC ruined that for me forever. While I am not overjoyed with President Trump's full cabinet I'm still of the mindset that he is honestly looking out for the future of America. He's still got my support. If he does Assange wrong I'm jumping off the "Trump Train".

       Where are you getting this 'of course' from? 99.99% of classified material is not cyber weapons. Are you talking speculatively, as in, what if? Or are you trying to assert this as fact?

       Thanks for the write up and analysis. Could very well be what's going on. I'd love to see it all play out, but I've become a bit of a cynic these days. Many people don't understand that the world that hear power moguls operate in is completely different than the reality they manufacture for is. Too many people believe too much of what they see. More folks need to start thinking critically and reading between the lines.

       Trump HAS to give Assange a reason/excuse to use the dead man switch in a legitimate way, therefore revealing the previously sent out insurance files with all the unreacted names and targets. Otherwise Assange looks like the bad guy that cause the mess it will cause when this all happens.

       Any narrative with clear-cut good guys and bad guys needs to get tossed into the bin of old Disney knock-offs at the nearest Walmart. That's about all the value it'll add to society.

       I've heard a fair bit about Obama from a guy who knew Michelle (he isn't a fan of Barack, lol), and the difference between his descriptions and the cartoon villain floating around this place is pretty funny to observe.

       I think there's a lot of young folks here. When you're young, everybody seems so big and important. Then you age a bit and realize how fucking clueless everyone you meet really is. I have a hard time believing enough truly competent people exist to pull off the kinds of machinations some people describe here.

       No, you misunderstand. Rubio was focused on children of illegals (and thus illegal themselves) staying in the country because they had no choice in the matter. Rubio wasn't calling the children (or any of them) criminals.

       This is going in circles. They are all criminals. Rule of law will not be restored until they are gone. It's sad that youth got caught up in this mess, but it's not our fault and they are not our problem. What next, their parents can stay?

       This also means that Assange will become like William Colby - he'll give up the one thing keeping him alive.
      </p>
      <p>
       For those unaware, Colby was a previous CIA director who was too candid in his replies to congress. He was later (allegedly) murdered long after he'd retired.

       maybe, maybe not! Assange is working in a differrent 'world' and has the instantnet to spread the news, unlike Colby, who was one of the very first very high level spooks to speak of the things the CIA had done
at the behest of their masters ..
      </p>
      <p>
       But with this event, things could happen so quickly that the info Assange releases 'takes out' all the people who would want to kill him in the first place!

       y'know, this just could work and it's a crazy idea!

       Keep in mind also that 6 weeks ago on March 9th 2017, "Julian Assange of Wikileaks and Nigel Farage, the champion of Brexit and a well-known emissary of President Trump."
      </p>
      <p>
       This meeting took place just days after the Vault 7 leaks started

        arrival

       the author says "Leaks like this will give the President increasing authority to reign in the rogue elements of the Deep State and subject it to the will of the American People. "
      </p>
      <p>
       But this shadow war will have many twists and turns and the outcome is far from certain. In this endeavour Assange is a vital ally. It is therefore good to see that efforts between Trump and the Australian super hacker are being wisely coordinated. "

       I heard crooked Hillary is right now on a plane headed to Bahrain, trying to escape from Jeff Sessions. But Trump is going after her in his private jet, and he intends to personanally lock her up. When he's done with her, he'll proceed to rid the world of all Evil, and we can all enjoy unicorns and rainbows while we shout MAGA and praise the God Emperor and his Goldman Sachs "anti establishment" deep state cabinet.

       You forgot the part where he nukes Israel and Saudi Arabia after shooting down Hillary and then resurrects Hitler's hidden corpse and ushers in the 4th Reich. We're all given a billion dollars of the new non federal reserve Trump notes and our proud Aryan children all weep with joy at the mere thought of papa Trump. Then after Trump's personal fighter jet touches back down on American soil every single natural born citizen in the country stands and applauds our God Emperor. The world has never seen a more just and perfect leader. Bald eagles swoop down from the sky and lay a wreath upon Trump's head and alas, we are all finally so tired of winning we die while clutching a framed portrait of the greatest man who ever lived Donald Trump, the guy from that reality show who also had a cameo in Home Alone 2.

       My point is that it usually takes some skill and knowledge to use software exploits. A person with very little computer skill such as Hillary wouldn't be able to use a CIA level piece of software. Such software is designed for experienced users.

       Again, any proof of that beyond wild speculation?

       I know this sounds crazy but any good theory has to have at least one actual fact somewhere in there that makes it plausible.

       As an example,
       <strong>
        specific CIA malware revealed in "Year Zero" is able to penetrate, infest and control both the Android phone and iPhone software that runs or has run presidential Twitter accounts.
       </strong>
       The CIA attacks this software by using undisclosed security vulnerabilities ("zero days") possessed by the CIA but if the CIA can hack these phones then so can everyone else who has obtained or discovered the vulnerability.
       <strong>
        As long as the CIA keeps these vulnerabilities concealed from Apple and Google (who make the phones) they will not be fixed, and the phones will remain hackable.
       </strong>

       "The same vulnerabilities exist for the population at large, including the U.S. Cabinet, Congress, top CEOs, system administrators, security officers and engineers. "

       Having these tools would give the Clinton mafia power and that's exactly why I believe they stole them.

       Isn't most malware kinda tiny? You don't need a whole server to store such a thing. A common USB flash drive would be a better choice. That way you can place it in a secure location and keep it away from the Internet and potentially having it stolen by a hacker.

       Umm have you not heard of the CIA using mind control drugs on Trump? They're going to weaponize mosquitos with a HIV and Zika virus blend and then release it on Christians in North America and Europe. Once they've infected a substantial percentage of the population, they're going to use the same mind control drugs they used on Trump on the CDC. The CDC will convince the government that Christians are a threat to humanity, and the government will grant them a second tier citizenship that forces them to use separate facilities. Once the Christians become a minority, America can be taken over by the deep state created by Obama and Soros. This has already started and the is currently in phase 2 based on some leaks I've read online. Bernie is also going to insert microchips in Ivanka and Jared so that he can force them to support abortion and climate change. Luckily for us, Putin has hired a team of secret bodyguards to protect his assets.

       Good post. Interesting to see other theories on this. This is definitely possible and I hope its the case. I've been questioning Trumps 180 turns on positions lately and I'm ignoring that there is still a silent war going on behind the scenes and its highly possible Trump is on the good side of things and playing everything really carefully. Here on this sub we just view and come to.our own conclusions. Like what we see is what we get, but are not being open minded enough to what's possibly going on behind the curtain. Who knows, but good post.

       This makes a lot of sense. Everything that's happened since the Syria (false-flag) retaliation gives a surface indication he's playing the Cabal's game, but he's only changed strategies. It's trickery. Most people assume that Trump has no idea what he's doing, but you don't become one of the top businessmen in history by being an idiot.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think N Korea is mostly theater, as they are one of many Cabal proxy states against the ropes lately. We do need to be allied with China and Russia to clean up the mess once and for all.

       This theory is ridiculous based on the first two words.  Hillary Clinton does not hold any elected government position.  She has no power.  She is an irrelevant loser.  How much longer will the Trump cultists on this sub continue to frame her as the ominous Boogeyman behind the scenes when she is a complete non-factor?  Why is it so difficult to accept that the President is not the faultless savior that you expected him to be?

       Fuck, I voted for Trump, and I flipped on him as soon as he sent 1,000 troops to Syria, way before the air base attack, when everyone was calling me a faggot and a shill for it

       It's not that hard to admit you were wrong about something.  I got caught up in the narrative and the theatre of it all - lost my way, voted for him.  Doesn't mean I have to support the fucker for the rest of my life

       bunch of nonsense. Trump is a shill in a long line of shills. You think they would just roll over and give up POTUS to an outsider? regardless of which suit is in the white house the agenda doesn't change.

       Probably safe to ignore OP. Yesterday he posted something about how President Obama was not the same person who was the son of Stanley Ann Dunham.

      <p>
       That's a crackpot theory, as the personal resemblance between Barack Obama (the President) and Stanley Ann Dunham is very strong. He is obviously her child.

       My good friend,  wikileaks is rothschild funded.  Clinton as well.  Trump also thru kushner.  All sides are one at the top level of financial elite plotting ww3, dont fucking kid yourself.  Breitbart was conceived of in israel and thus allowed to flourish.  Alt right, Soros left.  It's a rich man's club and you ain't in it.  They sacrifice people like you.

       That's most likely referring to the parent/child hierarchical schema of the database, not children in the typical sense. Other pages have it:

       Fun read. And while I love that Assange gets his pardon in your fantasy, unless it's done under the premise that he's dead and lives out his life in total exile, neither side is going to allow it.

       This is almost exactly what I was thinking would go on, except in my version the DMS doesn't get triggered, but rather they get assange, he turns state's witness and they go about these actions from within the DOJ... but now that you mention it a general DMS trigger would work, and the compromised deepstaters could be taken out extrajudicially by other actors (or patriots posing as other actors) that have a beef. nice post.

       I'm so not that, though. There's never been a time before 2016 that i would have had any expectation of a president doing anything different than their predecessors. I couldn't even have anticipated doing so. I've only been persuaded to be open minded this time because i've seen a number of things happen in the last 6 months i would have said "never ever" about a year ago.

       Weiner laptop is part of this as well? What if Weinertop has RUS connections as well or is part of the investigation?

       It's always significant to remember that the Clinton Foundation was originally NOT the Clintons' idea. It was a concept developed by their friend (convicted pedophile) Jeffrey Epstein. See here:
       <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/us/2016/07/06/billionaire-sex-offender-epstein-once-claimed-co-founded-clinton-foundation.html">
        http://www.foxnews.com/us/2016/07/06/billionaire-sex-offender-epstein-once-claimed-co-founded-clinton-foundation.html
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       It was Epstein who had the idea, and Epstein who used his own lawyers to draw up the papers.
      </p>
      <p>
       So this gets to a point the Original Poster made: How the Clintons managed to acquire so much leverage over world leaders.
      </p>
      <p>
       The reality is: Most of them were invited to Epstein's Pedophile Island and filmed having sex with underaged girls and boys.
      </p>
      <p>
       THAT'S how they acquired control over them.
      </p>
      <p>
       When you peel back the layers of the onion, the Clintons don't even appear to have been running the Clinton Foundation. They were frontmen for Epstein. Epstein used the Clintons for their name and their rolodex.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Clintons gave him (and his shadowy associates) entré to all the major parliaments and palaces of the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       To believe persistent rumors that are coming out from law enforcement people, the Clintons themselves are blackmailed by the very organization that Epstein founded.

       A large number of these tools are available on the dark web and have been for a long time. A while back someone on Reddit tried to bait me into providing a link to them so watch your ass. I may be mistaken but I'm pretty sure an "anonymous" type hacker group released a zip file with most of the tools a few weeks ago. I was on vacation at the time so didn't download it. I'm not sure what all it contained.
