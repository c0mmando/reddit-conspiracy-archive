       If you do realize that she might undergo a serious depression. Once the enormity of the lies hits home, and the full realization of how blind most american are, you lose faith in everything. What press? What courageous senator (except for Paul Wellstone)? What court system? It is a horrible state of mind as everything becomes suspect and senseless.

       it's a bad idea to try and force the red pill on someone, especially a loved one. We've all been conditioned to fight against it, even if a loved one, the people you love the most, once they start talking 9/11 and all that shit, their programming kicks in and they have no choice but to try and protect the 'reality' they've got built up in their mind's eye.

       I wouldn't say force. More like show them the truth about our government. Yes, it can be scary to know that your government will kill its own civilians to push an agenda, but we must seek the truth. If we continue to have this apathetic attitude with our government then it will be our doom.

       It's not about blindly walking towards doom. Let's say you are redpilled, she is not. The only benefit is the fear which will erase naivete about the world in general. That's a double edge sword, the fear is what keeps us in line.

       Lol you are making assumptions. I personally would not want to be with someone who wasn't already redpilled. But I also know you can't force someone to swallow the truth. The truth is a conclusion based on available evidence, not everyone will come to the same conclusion.

       Sure, keeping women in the dark about the truth will do us wonders.
      </p>
      <p>
       It seems like you're saying a woman's part of our progression is to be quiet and only talk about the pretty things. Both men and women can see the darkness and the light, it doesn't need to be separated by sex and it shouldn't be. We are meant to be strong together.
      </p>
      <p>
       Giving the advice of not telling your wife/girlfriend how you view the world because you think she's too fragile due to her being a woman is absurd. You're also putting all of this burden and pressure on the man, when it doesn't need to be. Share the pressure and the pain, and more critical thinking and planning will come to light. Stop being silent.

       i said no such thing.
my current partner is very aware of certain aspects of what is occuring. for the past few days they were very distant and full of concern. when asked what was going on with them, was confronted with serious emotional concern about the direction of the topic on DPRK and the potentials for a serious and even nuclear war.
i reiterated that we can likely do nothing to change this situation beyond loving our friends, family and spreading wellbeing with whoever we share time with. this helps them to relax and focus on the things we can do to change this direction. telling our partners they should be freaking out about the direction of the world serves no purpose but spreading fear.

       Why are people saying no to red-pulling someone? We need to wake up as many people as possible!
      </p>
      <p>
       It's going to crush their worldview but they will no longer be blind. We need people to see the corruption in our government.
      </p>
      <p>
       I say yes, do it. If we don't collectively wake up as a nation, there will be nothing we can do.

       You can offer the blue or red pill to anyone. Only under their own consent may they partake.
      </p>
      <p>
       Be careful though, casting pearls before swine simply results in a shitty undigested pearl and a pig that is still very hungry.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not calling your wife swine but I think the bible was onto something with the previous metaphor in regards to sharing something extremely valuable with someone who is so hungry and fixated on other things, they cannot ever appreciate the pearl you wish to share.

       I find it kind of funny that the subject would not have come up before, at least in come context, if you were yourself red-pilled before your relationship. My assumption is that you either have only recently been 'red-pilled' yourself. Is that the case?
