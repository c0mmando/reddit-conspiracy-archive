       The vertical datums we use to model an equipotential surface for leveling are directly built off of gravity measurements. If it is hollow then there is a super dense layer between the center and the crust.

       This is interesting to me, not because of flat earth, but because I thought that the real gravity changed depending on where you are on the planet.  I thought it was weaker towards the poles? Could be wrong.  I think there are areas of the earth with slightly lower / higher values even away from the poles.
      </p>
      <p>
       I just wonder if it were true, would it affect your measurements?

       There are slight variations dependent on distance from the center mass (I'm sure of that one) as well as pockets of stronger or weaker gravity dependent on the density of material below you. (not certain that that is true) All of theses variations are extremely slight.

       Yes. Gravity varries around the earth. It mostly has to do with the composition of the crust at these points. Dense materials in this area? More gravity. And yes they affect our measurements.

       Because we live in a society where we are being lied to CONSTANTLY, day in and day out,, with the obvious intention to limit the competency of the general public - so naturally, people are trying to question everything, and only believe things with verifiable proof - the problem with flat earth theorists is that there is tons of verifiable proof but people are ignoring it or not taking the time to scientifically prove it for themselves

       Thats why competency and a desire to learn/question are both very important - if you are only going to ask questions and not do any scientific problem solving, then you will find yourself more confused than how you started

       Exactly, my Mother doesn't do her research, so she believes that the Earth is truly flat, which I argue with her about on a weekly basis. I think these people believe they are red pilled, but in actuality they are pawns of some CIA ( or whatever ) operation to spread false information, to make people think they are red pilled when they actually aren't.

       I understand their perspective, and i sympathize - but at some point, you have to realize that you are King among Kings - you have the mentality capacity to go out and prove or disprove aspects of the physical world to yourself if you wish to disbelieve your education - the worst thing you can do is try to indoctrinate other people into believe your false theory that you havent even taken the time to whole-fully verify

       I'd say that her belief in the conspiracy that surrounds what you happen to believe is just as genuine and rests on a better foundation and observable evidence in more ways than one than the one you suspect about what she happens to believe about that.
      </p>
      <p>
       She obviously mistrusts and is suspicions about the motives of all the so called "authorities" that you don't ever dare to question because you've been thoroughly educated not to, nor do you want to face the possibility that what they taught you and what you've subsequently come to believe as a result of it, is precisely why the world is in the present state and predicament that's it's in.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nothing has played as big a role in the making of wars, the spreading of violence, and the ruthless exploitation of other human beings and the environment itself in the past century as science itself has with the pre-eminent status and general authority it has been given over very nearly every aspect human life.
      </p>
      <p>
       It clearly isn't a discipline that has managed control what information it seeks out and applies strictly for any greater good, nor was it ever.
      </p>
      <p>
       It began and still is a tool of the rich and wealthy who have always funded and directed it towards improving the advantages they enjoy over the masses and supressing and repressing the discovery of any information that might ever upset that balance.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is a science in the pursuit of private monetary profits and material wealth strictly for a few and there are no benefits that it has ever brought or bestowed on mankind that didn't always have that motive behind them.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is also more than ample evidence that any who pursue science out of any purely altruistic motives will either have their minds very quickly changed about that or else be forced out of the field altogether and prevented in whatever ways are necessary from pursuing that goal depending on what kind of threat it represents to the existing order.

       It's not a problem of them questioning too much, it's a problem of their competency. I think many may of the 'flat-earth' types actually be mentally ill, which obviously hinders their ability to be a reasonable skeptic.

       Not all conspiracies are created equal, and while I do think it's certainly interesting how 'mass-surveilance' was treated for years as a conspiracy theory on the same level as chem-trails and lizard people. Don't think that insane chemtrail and flat-earth people don't exist though, they're certainly out there. They might be used as bludgeons to attack &amp; cast aspersions on actual conspiracies, but they do exist.

       I don't think the problem is questioning too much (pondering even the obvious can give deeper insight, and pausing to think about someone's motivations even when they are speaking the truth can be helpful). It's that questioning can become synonymous with only believing answers that contradict mainstream opinions (I've seen some theories that assert that the way to find the truth of some event is to take the literal opposite of even throwaway details in the official narrative). That's not how you get to the truth; it just makes you a different brand of wrong.

       I think you hit the nail on the head with this one, but you didn't mention that this is also the land of alternative facts, and biased study.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are plenty of "legitimate" and "scientific" organizations who are not obeying the scientific model for corporate reasons. Regardless of their motivation this definitely biases the peasant who does her/his own research.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example, if the peasant with google wanted to know "can mercury in vaccines pass the blood-brain barrier" she/he would come up with plenty of well documented "evidence" to prove both that mercury in vaccines is harmless or harmful depending on which source is referenced.

       This is the real failing of most claims about the government trying to "suppress the truth" about this or that, why bother when so many people are screaming so many things at the tops of their voices. It'll just get lost in the roar, anyway. Hell, that is a big part of Russia's domestic propaganda strategy. Generate so much chatter that no one really knows what is going on, so that anything might seem believable or might be fiction. Dismiss scandals or create them on a whim. It's pretty interesting.

       That's a problem with conspiracy theorists in general. When we discover something that we think was hidden from us it confirms our beliefs and we fight "tooth and nail" to "get the truth out".
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem is once we latch onto something it takes a hell of a lot more evidence to change our minds than it did to convince us in the first place.
      </p>
      <p>
       All humans suffer from this problem. It's called "confirmation bias".
      </p>
      <p>
       It can be much worse when it happens to a conspiracy theorist because when other people show contrary evidence, the conspiracy theorist has a preconceived idea that other people are trying to "suppress the truth" and the contrary evidence becomes more evidence of this suppression. This has the unintended consequence of reinforcing the false belief.
      </p>
      <p>
       The more you try to prove to a flat earther that the earth is spherical, the more you confirm their belief that there is a conspiracy to "hide the reality" of a flat earth.
      </p>
      <p>
       The best you can do is provide the evidence that contradicts their belief so that if they do start to question it, they have an alternative to consider. It also helps to prevent the false belief from spreading to others.

       It's used as an insult whenever you cross a boundary here in our limited hangout. Pizzagate and questioning Assange's whereabouts are very touchy subjects. I was called a flat earther yesterday for simply bringing up some facts about what happened to wikileaks back in October.

       I believe that person was trying to cast doubt in your mind. IMO PG and FE are distractions. PG has some substance, but is a dead end without any solid evidence. FE is bogus but hard to disprove because you can't just blast all the Flat Earthers into space so you have to use logic to show them first gravity exists and show them the effect it has on things like bubbles.

       It was a reasonable question when his internet was cut but peoples PoL demands got ridiculous and it quickly grew into a concern trolling disinfo effort to distract from the leaks. At this point I'd believe he was a Russian spy before I believed he was abducted from the embassy and killed.

       The only time I've seen it mentioned is a post or two on threads where he's brought up, and the same PGL key he'd been using for the longest time isn't a rediculous request, it's just asking him to continue what he always did if he's capable.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thus far no one has proven he's incapable, or given a reason why he's not able to supply it, to my knowledge. So the question still remains perfectly valid. What happened while his Internet was cut?

       They created a WhereIsAssange sub and were trying to push the narrative that, without satisfying their PoL demands, nothing WL said or leaked could be trusted because they were 100% compromised. The whole sub eventually did a 180 and died.

       The timeline is admittedly weird but the theory is full of holes. For one, that embassy is right next to Harrods, one of if not the biggest toy store in the world, in a very busy district of London. Everyone would see shit going down. For two, it makes zero sense to lock down one of the worlds busiest airports to fly the guy out of when they could easily go to a private airstrip and never be seen by anyone.

       It's the middle Knightsbridge so there's not too many airstrips nearby other than the actual airports.  I used to live in London and we walk past all manner of kerfuffles every day.  You don't even look round at an emergency vehicle most of the time as it just doesn't concern you and it's one of a good few you'll probably see that day.  There wouldn't be any shit going down anyway.  In fact, had he had his lunch spiked for example, he may have just been a lump of meat to be moved.

       Me either.  The whole thing stinks.  We knew there were more leaks coming and there were rumours that they concerned something treasonous concerning Obama and Clinton.*  What we'd seen already was bad enough (although you might not think so from the medias coverage).  Assange plays the Bond Villain and with the drip feeding in order to maximise damage to the Dems chances, gives them all enough time to move before it's out.  Pamela Anderson suddenly appears at the embassy with some food (I swear when I read this in the paper at work I looked up and said 'something is not right here.') then London City airport is evacuated for a very short period of time, RT is threatened with having it's UK bank accounts frozen (thus placing Russia as something negative or naughty in the publics eye but also no doubt giving them someting to do for the day) and wikileaks starts to 'change' a little, throwing us useless scraps of old news and being evasive about the simple question of Assanges safety for days and days on end.  Oh and the internet went down as well at the same time.  Due to the face2face software, unless you see him in person or really trust somebody else that has then it's perfectly rational to wonder whether they've used this in any vids you see.  The intelligence agencies obviously have this stuff and this is the kind of shit it's for.  Unless the CIA/NSA would use it for entertainment purposes.

       It's a psyop. The ideas were planted on the internet and a few random, low-level celebrities were sacrificed to push the idea and fool as many idiots as they can and it somehow worked. I think they were doing their yearly intelligence test.

       Truth is not based on majority rule, and mobs of people can certainly be wrong. If anything, truth is popularly ridiculed and then attacked by the masses before it is accepted. No doubt if mainstream science changes its tune and accepts flat earth, and if Popular Science says the earth is flat, you'd agree instantly and without question. Give it time.

       Yes, since if mainstream science accepts flat earth, it would be because of major breakthroughs bringing to light how human perception was so wrong about so many things. Not because some cabal decided that the world should think that the world is flat.

       Questions should always remain open ended for a conspiracy theorist. IMO flat earth hasn't been concretely disproven, and the more you look into history of science, nasa,  the Cia, etc the more you'll see has been hidden from us. At the end of the day, I can go out on the beach, see another beach 15- 20 miles away(defies the formula for curvature, it should be well below the horizon). That's my personal proof. I can see how there is stretchs of land that defy the curvature and let you see further then you should be able to, but oceans should follow the curvature and they don't from my person observations. You can find many youtube videos of people zooming in on distant coasts which should be even further below the horizon.

       Are you serious right now? You really think because you can see things far away, that the earth must be flat? You realize all you have to do is look into a telescope to see the planets around us are spheres right? So you think there are several spherical planets orbiting the sun but somewhere in the middle there is a flat chunk of rock?

       No, I'm saying that seeing a coast over a body of water which should be well below the horizon according to the formula for the curvature of earth raises more questions.

       First off, what proves that pictures of the earth are doctored? What this thread has taught me already is that both sides, the flat earth people and the round earth people, both don't have any hard proof. There's too many questions on both sides and I know what side I'm on.
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         I believe the earth is round because I believe that pictures of the earth are real and not Doctored. I can't prove that the earth is round because I've never been to space, I can't prove the earth is round because I didn't take or make the photos. Asking someone if pictures of the earth are fake is a incredibly dumb question, because no one could prove such a thing.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         That same goes for the flat earth people. No one can prove the earth is flat. You can't say "I can't see the curvature" is like saying "I can't see God", you can't see either. Anyone claiming to have proof the earth is flat couldn't possibly without leaving the earth to take pictures.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         So some people question the validity of pictures of the Earth, which makes it seem like any proof of the Earth being round is a lie. But no one has real proof of the Earth being flat. So you've basically asked a question no one can answer. Neither side has clear proof since you asked your question.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       If you are going to ask for proof of the earth being round from me you aren't going to get it. I don't understand how the science of a flat earth would work and I'm not going to wrap my head around it. I have no proof, I already said you guys won because I can't answer I question without a answer.

       i agree with you, no one can answer it.  the problem is you calling it "outlandish" when no one can answer it..

       as for the doctored, thats just what ive read.. but good talk. i hope we can both keep an open mind on subjects like this that are theories and not 100% facts

       I'll keep a open mind, because I really don't have the answers. I think it's outlandish because that's how I was raised, and I had no reason to question if the pictures were fake, good talk.

       But what about pilots that have flown over 10,000 meters up and say the earth is round?
      </p>
      <p>
       If expert testimony and video/picture evidence isn't enough then what is?
      </p>
      <p>
       All experts are bought off. All photographic evidence is altered. What other evidence is there?
      </p>
      <p>
       And then where's the proof of a massive conspiracy? People have been travelling the world since we knew there was something more than our local tribe, so why is it that there aren't consistent reports and evidence about the truth?
      </p>
      <p>
       There's more credence to just about any other major conspiracy and it's why this thread even exists.

       first off i dont think the earth is flat, i dont think anything because they are all THEORIES
      </p>
      <p>
       second, thats why i said open sourced and video feed as well.. basically as much proof as we can that the flight is real. whats the problem with that?

       these theories are just that: theories. They stick around after being disproved, and they work extremely poorly at explaining material phenomena we see in the natural world. We already have proofs of the Earth's shape going all the way back to Eratosthenes.

       They don't.   It's not really an organic 'conspiracy theory' but rather something that certain folks specifically picked to start spamming CT type forums/subs with because it's a very well known 'stupid' idea from hundreds of years ago.  The idea will be to dillute all the good useful information here with shit in order to maybe put people off fom hanging around and learning something but also to create the impression that the users of the sub are people who believe any old shit.   It's scientifically provable that the Earth is round  (you can do this yourself) and on that basis alone posts claiming that the World is flat should be removed by the mods immediately in my opinion due to the ratio of benefit and damage of having them here.

       My whole problem with the flat earth theory is 
1. You can walk around the world, there is no drop off point, there is no limit or cut off. If you can walk around the world that implies that it is round, because you can go around it forever. 
2. Others tried to tell me that pictures of the earth are CGI or falsely made, which isn't conspiracy it's stupidity. Yeah, the CIA has done some fucked up shit, but people have known the earth is round since before the CIA
3. The whole "I can't see the curves" thing is stupid,  you can't see the curves and shape of the earth in till you leave it, which would require going to space.

       They use benchmarks - you have a known point on the ground (x/y/z) - you set up your total station and that point is your reference.  Your surveying crew lays out the site based on that point and then the contractor comes and builds it.  As you get further from that point, your elevations get more and more inaccurate (because of the curvature of the earth) - so when you are laying out a road / railroad, you have to keep moving your survey along and update your reference point.
      </p>
      <p>
       In theory, If it wasn't for the curvature of the earth (or sight obstructions), you could probably just use one benchmark and survey based totally off of that.

       Its not so much that my job depends on me to 'agree' the earth is round - the shape of the earth is an obstacle in my line of work that I have to work against - engineers and surveyors basically prove on a daily basis that it is round, simply through the rigors of our work.
      </p>

       Nobody made us sign a contract stating "by signing this, you agree that the world is round".

       Download an autocad map trial  or arcgis - there is a whole ribbon devoted to coordinate systems and transforming coordinate systems, all of which is due to the shape of the earth.
      </p>
      <p>
       Go on your state or local city website - download GIS data.  Go to neighboring states websites, download their data.  Load this data into autocad/arcmap, mainting the correct coordinate systems.  Pick specific coordinates, download them onto a gps unit, and go locate them in real life with this gis unit and you will see that it takes you to the right place in different states.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, repeat the process, but use incorrect coordinate systems per state - you will bot be taken to the right place anymore.  If the world was flat, this wouldn't be a problem

       im pretty sure the whole flat earth thing is used as a means to discredit the conspiracy community and make us look like loonies so when we Do uncover something big nobody believes us.   im sorry if you have been swept up in the flat earf bullshit.
      </p>
      <p>
       FLAT EARTHERS:  fi you truly believe the earth is flat, take a step back.  consider the sources.  i know its easy to believe because we have been lied to about everything else in this world.  think critically.  train yourself.  and dont  be so easily led.  'da earf is not flat.

       its really not about proving thats it not real to them.   none of them will accept your proof.  see, they will either think youre a disinfo agent or youre just using science that you were taught and that we are taught a flawed version of science or you just dont understand (regardless of the fact that measuring the earth is how you make your living) etc etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       we have been lied to so much that we question everything.  we question everyone.  flat earthers are people that went down the rabbit hole and never came out the other side.  no amount of proof with deter them.  what they need is to be shown how to think like  a true conspiracy theorist.  how to think critically.  how to find reputable sources.  how to discern what is a good source and what is not.  what is junk science and what is not.
      </p>
      <p>
       the problem really isnt that they think the earth is flat.  the problem is the way they think is flawed.  deeply, deeply flawed.  somewhere along the way they lost themselves and we need to get them back on track because the more of us actual true conspiracy theorists there are, the strong we become and the more credibility we have.
      </p>
      <p>
       the conspiracy community is having its credibility ruined by people gravitating to these outlandish theories like pizzagate, flat earth, no planes on 9/11, illuminati bullshit etc.  i mean, bigfoot is more believable that these theories.

       Questions should always remain open ended for a conspiracy theorist. IMO flat earth hasn't been concretely disproven, and the more you look into history of science, nasa,  the Cia, etc the more you'll see has been hidden from us. At the end of the day, I can go out on the beach, see another beach 15- 20 miles away(defies the formula for curvature, it should be well below the horizon). That's my personal proof. I can see how there is stretchs of land that defy the curvature and let you see further then you should be able to, but oceans should follow the curvature and they don't from my person observations. You can find many youtube videos of people zooming in on distant coasts which should be even further below the horizon.

       Why does anyone hide anything? Many times its for power, other times to hide crime, hide techniques from rival countries , etc...They may have nothing to gain from hiding the data. Who knows? I know i dont , because their hiding it. Have you looked through any of the 12 million docs the CIA released? Many of them are mundane day to day things, but there's absolute bombshells in there too. That data was held back for 30 -40- 50 years. ... I guess my question back to you is why couldn't you come to this conclusion on your own? You really couldn't logic out a reason for people to hide stuff?

       The burden isn't on me to know why the US government would spend vast amounts of money simply to keep the public thinking the earth is a different shape by hiding all this information, it's on you. You made that claim. If the reasoning behind the claim is "who knows why? Could be anything", then that claim doesn't hold much weight.

       All one can do is speculate on where the trillions of dollars the us defense sector vaporizes because a  shrug and a "who the fuck knows why they do what they do" is the best that can be come up with even by the individual departments themselves. Obviously your ok with that and don't want to question anything.  Fact is the gov has been systemically hiding information from us for years. That's an established fact in this community. If you 100% trust the government then perhaps your in the right place to start tearing a few of those percentage points off.

       Almost his whole argument is based on GPS, a government created and controlled system. Does he expect we'd trust the government on a conspiracy theory sub? The government says it's a globe, so therefore it's a globe? His answers are no better than Bill Nye pointing to the fact that schools have globes in every classroom as "proof" of a spherical earth.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have questions for both theories, and don't mind debating, but it would be nice if someone who claimed to be able to "prove" the earth wasn't flat to at least be able to begin to understand the basics of the flat earth theory. People merely claiming that the earth is a globe because they were taught that in school, their job depends on them thinking that, or that the government claims it to be true, are not proving anything.

       Nobody has the desire to understand an idea that's contrary to reality itself. Show me a credible literature that refers to "ellipsoidal earth theory". You won't find one because it's not a theory, it's reality. I'm also a land surveyor and you're going to tell me I've spent 4 years doing calculations on the earth that not only check out mathematically every time, but can be ground truthed? There's no debate to be had here. If someone took you into orbit around the earth, what would be your reasoning for a flat earth then?

       I'd ask you the same for reasoning against it if you saw that it appeared flat from a high altititude flight or balloon. The first person to go to the stratosphere (misnomer?) Auguste Piccard, described earth as a flat disk, with the horizon always rising to sight. Not long after, the "credible" literature (dogma) published new theories to explain ball earth/heliocentrism in complex, confusing ways. Like today, people accept those dogmatic theories as facts, end of story. They remain theories.

       How the hell can we? Flat Earther's have about 98 different theories for every fact that blows holes in the flat Earth model. I've yet to hear what moves the sun in the FE model or why you can't see Miami from Bimini at night when it's only 40 miles away and Miami is bright as all fuck at night. Don't blame us just because you guys have a cluster fuck potpourri of pseudo science bullshit.

       I'm not a flat earther just yet, but I'm asking questions which so far have not been answered satisfactorily. There are problems with flat earth, but there are more problems with ball earth. As far as I'm concerned much of modern science
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       a cluster fuck potpourri of pseudo science bullshit. Some of you people don't realize modern science is followed like a religion but you are just so blinded by your religiosity to know it.
      </p>
      <p>
       What moves the sun if it's moving closeby? I'm not sure. There are things in both theories that are unknown. Coastlines across water from over 100 miles away are visible, not the tips of mountains but the beach, which should not be possible on a ball earth. Ships that "disappeared" over the horizon can be brought back by telexcope. Lighthouses are "bright as all fuck at night" but can be seen by ships hundreds of miles out. How much of the cluster fuck science has been invented out of thin air to try to explain the problems of heliocentrism? 98 theories? Or just 2 so complex 98% of the populace won't understand it?

       Have you ever sailed? I'm guessing you heard the bullshit about ships being seen with a telescope once they go over the horizon on YouTube. I've never met a single competent navigator who believes that shit. I cut my teeth on the North Atlantic in multi hills and a few monos. I spent twelve years sailing the gulf of Mexico and the waters between the Bahamas and Florida. You can't see Miami from Bimini and it's only 40 miles. Tonight, call somebody in Bimini and ask them to look west. Have you seen Miami? At night it's bright as fuck. I'll tell you what, the British Navy has a dock patrol launch right on the Western edge of Bimini. Give them a ring tonight. They are good guys, they'll talk to you. I usually bullshit with them for a half hour about the states when I enter Bahamian waters. Tell them you're unsure about the shape of the Earth and you need them to look for Miami for you. Oh god please record that conversation.....

       Why is it that questioning the shape of the earth means never having never sailed or flown before? People ask that as if I would know for sure the earth is rounded if they only did. Yes, I've flown over oceans, I've sailed in the Caribbean and they even let you fly co-pilot seat in the little island-hopping Cessna planes when you fly in. So I've sailed and flown (at the controls!). I've flown in helicopters, been in aircraft carriers at sea, too. I'm not sure your point.

       Tell your competent navigators to watch as a ship disappears, and then tell them to zoom in. Scientists will tell you it's a mirage or light magically bending, when common sense and simplicity tells you that it is a flat or only slightly rounded surface and perspective has made the distant object vanish from sight. As for whatever locale you're in, I can't tell you what you see. If you have a good zoom, then zoom in, I'm sure you'd see the distant lights come into view, unless the atmosphere is too thick, or the dirty Miami air blocks the view. Elsewhere, on clear days much further distances have been seen. The earth may not be flat, but at the least, the 8 inches squared per mile of curvature is verifiably not correct.

       You're right. Whether or not you've ever personally observed any of the phenomena is irrelevant. That's why you have YouTube. So, you gonna call Bimini tonight? That should settle this beyond a doubt.

       I've personally observed the horizon to be flat and I've seen pictures and video. I have never had any logical reason to believe I'm on a spinning ball speeding 600 million miles per hour through vacuum created with a bang from nothing, and neither do you.

       There's no shame in being afraid.....Since I have no doubt the world is round and therefore don't suffer the same phobia that my world view will be shattered, I went ahead and called the RBDF (the number is 1-242-362-1818 if you'd like to check for yourself) and spoke with Midshipman Clark. After explaining the purpose of my call and him having a bit of a chuckle at my expense, he gladly took a moment from his otherwise tedious duties to throw a quick line, look outside and confirm that he could absolutely NOT see Miami.
So, just for shits and giggles, do you believe the entire Bahamian Naval Force is in on your tinfoil hatness? If, as you claim, you can see beaches from hundreds of miles away, why can't he see Miami which is a bare 40 miles? He also made another excellent point that the world has been navigating by the stars for time immemorial which would be impossible on flat plane. I asked him if he ever saw a boat come back into view once it went over the horizon through the use of optics and he laughed and said no, that in fact, when actually chasing drug smugglers (their main duty apparently) they use binoculars all the time, but once the boat goes over the horizon, it's simply gone. I can understand why you'd not want to call. He was barely suppressing his laughter the entire time. I'm dying to hear your explanation....

       If the administrator of NASA told me the earth was a sphere, do you think I would believe him? Do you think I consider a midshipman (a rank below Ensign Wesley Crusher!) any more trustworthy?

      <p>
       I will not call Mr Clark, because I have better things to do with my Sunday night. But you can show him this video or countless videos, or wipe off his high power telescope, not some deck binoculars, to see ships come back in view which had disappeared from the naked eye. He will see the earth is
       <em>
        either
       </em>
       flat or a much different curvature than science says. At the least he will know ships do not go over a curve when they disappear. But tell him if he learns the truth, he had better keep it to himself if he ever wants to rise in the ranks.

       And THIS is what causes ignorance; refusing to examine any information that confronts your beliefs. I have no beliefs. I have observations. We'll observe together. Let's start with something simple. You can see the moon, right? I can see the moon. The moon is a sphere, right? You can see this with your own eyes. Now, please tell me YOUR theory of how the perfect circle shadow is cast on the moon by a flat earth. This requires NO outside informations. This is simply two guys looking at the moon.

       I'm not sure which of those three things you are, but I could take my pick and be certain you couldn't explain where gravity comes from, or relativity, two things necessary in a ball earth model. When you realize that gravity may be an invented theory made solely to explain balls whizzing in space and people not flying off of earth, then you can move forward in your education. Only you can take your red pills.

       Hey... if I buy a tape measure from Canada and take it to South Australia, does it grow longer during the flight, or does it just suddenly expand once I get to Australia?
      </p>
      <p>
       Have a look at the lines of longitude on your map. They are obviously further apart in Australia than Canada, so the physical distance between them must grow the further away you get from the north pole.
      </p>
      <p>
       But when we measure those distances they haven't grown. The only way this could be possible is if our tape measures are growing too.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or maybe this map is complete bullshit and doesn't accurately reflect physical reality.

       I mean, given all the experiemental data that proves general relativity to be true, I'll certainly go with Tesla's comment.  I mean, everyone knows he knew literally everything about gravitation and particle physics, and the electromagnetic spectrum.  Naturally, he had his own theory, but shucky darns, never wrote it down, because why would you want to write something down?  That's crazy talk!

       Have you watched that video?

       How does water not fall off the earth? 
Same way nothing falls off the earth... Their is a force that pulls us towards the centre, any object you drop will accelerate at 9.81 m s2 towards the earth. The mass of water on earth accounts for just 0.02% of earth's mass. Imagine how little a cargo ship weighs compared to all the water... And look to the left of that ship tipping over, it's run aground. This guy has no idea how large the earth is...
      </p>
      <p>
       Gravity is just a theory? 
This shows a huge lack of understanding. Our theories of gravity, the equations we have constructed to describe the phenomenon of every object being attracted to the earth, are theories yes, but, that doesn't make the phenomena fake.... Everything on earth is attracted to the surface and accelerates at the same rate. Go look at the sky with a telescope, you see everything large is round?
      </p>
      <p>
       Those zoom out clips are so dumb - the objects just get smaller than the size of the cameras pixels. Aka they are below the resolution of the camera. This doesn't happen with your eye. Go look for yourself. You've been lied to.

       Take the longest ruler that you can find. Use that ruler to draw a straight line. Now spin the ruler through 180 degrees and check the line you've just drawn with the same edge that you used to draw it. This is a standard comparison technique for adjusting out errors in survey equipment. If the line is still matching the ruler, the ruler is straight.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now take that straight ruler to the beach and hold it up to the horizon. The horizon will noticeably fall away at either end of the ruler.

       But if everything was on a single plane, that wouldn't matter. The line passing through your eye and the edge of the ruler would meet the horizon no matter what point on the ruler you were looking through.
      </p>
      <p>
       The test at the start proves the ruler is straight. Your eye is a fixed point. The only thing that can be different is the horizon.

       I disagree. There are levels to all things.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do I believe there are lots of shady things that our governments and media do? Yes. I believe.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do I believe 9/11 was done by Bush? No.

       Do I believe we know everything about 9/11? No.

       My point is that because you beleive in some moderate theories doesn't mean you're mentally ill or by believing that 9/11 was done by Bush means that you also think the Queen is a lizard.

       You completely misconstrued my point. My point was about how conspiracy users completely dismiss Flat Earth (as they should) but because its "totes government agents trying to discredit us" instead of acknowledging that they attract fucking weirdo's that may or may not have some form of mental illness.

       I'm not the person you replied to, but I personally think it's a little bit from column A, a little from column B. Given shady stuff government agencies have done in the past with regards to mass disinformation campaigns I wouldn't put it past them to manufacture outlandish false conspiracies. On the other hand, I think that ignorant or mentally ill people then take those conspiracies and run with it.

       absolutely it does attract the mentally ill.  its up to those of us who are not mentally unstable to help those who are.  and to do that we need to know how to separate fiction from truth.  and to learn not to advocate for something just because it conforms to our worldview.

       If you go with subjective things like "why would they do lie?" He says the gov lie. When there are facts, they are from "scientists that have been paid off by the government."

       Hey, if you truly believe the earth is real, take a step back. Consider the sources. I know it's easy to believe because we have been lied to about everything else in this world. think critically. train yourself. and don't be so easily led. 'da earf is not fake'.

       I mean NASA could just just a picture of the earth and settle it once and for all, but nah, we keep getting CGI photos that were created by 'artists'. but sure, it's all really real.

       But I could make up any crazy theory, right this second, and say the rebuttals of any dissenters are the "same bullshit people said when". That doesn't make it true, y'know? That's just not a logical conclusion to me.

       Could you provide proof that NASA has created CGI photos?

       I'm not trying to be an asshole, I'm trying to think critically here and encourage you to do the same. We must learn to recognize our unconscious biases or we will never uncover any truth. I recognize that to some degree, I want the globe model to stay true, but that doesn't confirm that it's flat by any means.

       I could provide proof, but it's readily available and easily so, I am not gonna spend my saturday researching for you.

      <p>
       Also, you can make up any theory you want, that's how theories are started in fact, sure some are based on indicators based on perhaps experiments or observations, but at the end of the day, theories are really just made up in the mind of the person who created it based solely on the VERY limited information they have.

       I don't believe the earth is flat, I don't believe it's round either, I think whatever is going on here, is nothing at all of what anyone of us can imagine in our wildest dreams. This could all be a simulation, which would mean we are not on a flat or ball earth, but pixels being generated by the 'system'.

       Looks like we're on the same page. My only gripe with that is that anyone can look out with a telescope and see other planets. Round planets. Am I wrong?
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't trust anything I've been told at the end of the day. But I refuse to cling to the Flat-Earth theory because if this is some artificially constructed reality, I highly doubt it's a convenient flat disc just chillin' out in space. I'd be much more inclined to believe it's a hologram being projected than that.

       This right here.  This is what flat earfers do when given hard proof to the contrary.  This dismissing of evidence hurts us as researchers  we need to learn how to cope with verifiable evidence that contradicts our worldview.

       Because the pictures are largely photoshopped so you can actually see the fucking earth. Believe it or not there are a lot of clouds which tend to block out the ground (When viewing from space) so NASA will take a bunch of photos and stitch them together to give a clear photo of what the earth looks like from space

       "Those are all CGI composited together by an 'Artist'."

       This is exactly what I mean.  You say "Release some photos, and clear it up, NASA"  I post photos, you go "Eh, not good enough, here's video that's not taken at any angle, with a small field of view that "proves" the earth is flat.  One video, versus almost every photo of the earth taken from space."  It's like, you didn't even bother to discuss any of the links I posted.  This is why arguing with people on reddit is pointless.  No one wants a valid arguement, they just want to shit post.  I'm done with you.

       There's a vast difference in several photos and live video and a single video.  He also made a point about the physics involved in your model that were left unanswered.  I believe this to be ridiculous discussion in the first place, but if you intend to convince anyone;  You're going to need explanations about physics.
      </p>
      <p>
       We can use mathematics and science to explain our planet.  It's easy to understand and can be observed.  If this were truly something important to you, then I'm sure you've taken the time to set up an experiment that can prove or disprove the curvature of the earth, right?  Simply hand waving science in favor of believing... whatever this model is.  In short, can you prove it?  With your model, can you provide explanations to the functions of gravity or lack thereof?

       My point is, I could have provided 100 different pictures, videos, 'math' whatever, the chances it changes anyones opinions on the matter? very little. And that is the exact same problem people are missing when it comes to people who believe in flat earth, you may provide ten different links all 'proof' but from the FE's perspective, you're just pushing the narrative with the very pieces of propaganda that FE's don't believe in.
      </p>

       Likewise the video I link, person I was responding to probably didn't even watch it for more than a minute, but they're convinced without a doubt it shows a ball earth, doesn't matter all those who have seen it and see a flat earth, their perspective is just fucked, right?

       The "blue marble" collection of earth photo's are all fake. Most images by NASA are made in the same way this guy describes. Sattelites orbiting the earth collect data. And it's not some kind of analog image. If you listen to the interview of his floating around somewhere he describes how they measure the water to color its depth. They measure it by analyzing the levels of photoplankton in the ocean.
      </p>
      <p>
       People ask themselves why do they go all through that when they send so much shit into space and why they just cannot attach a small camera of some sort to take a full sized picture every once in awhile. Wouldn't it be useful to have a whole shot for data analysis? They even say themselves using the sattelites isn't ideal because there are gaps between orbits and they have to guess and blend in the blanks.

       That's why I said some pictures are CGI. I wasn't saying they all were but that method is a common way they make the photo's and providing an artist that admits it like you were asking for. Beside's those earlier photo's non of their released photo's are claimed to be a full picture of the earth. And even that chinese picture is just a large scan of the earth in the same satellite method of gathering data.
      </p>
      <p>
       To the best of my knowledge most photo's of the earth are taken in the pan-chromatic form. Where it measures 15 wavelengths compiles that data and then they build a photo of earth from that. That is how they can say it is a "picture" of the earth because it is made in that way. I can't find out what kind of camera is attached to Chang'e 5 T1 that took that picture so unfortunately we can't discuss the matter any futher towards credibility.
      </p>
      <p>
       All the pictures from the hubble space telescope are made in the same way. They take all the data from analyzing the light spectrum and the "color" is added according to the data. It's not providing some kind of analog image.
      </p>
      <p>
       However I am not a true believer 100% on either side of the argument but I don't think the earth is flat. But I believe the question of them lying is interesting and leads to something. I don't think we are getting the whole picture and I don't believe they would tell us even if they found something extraordinary up there. But you know there is video of them faking the earth photo's from the apollo capsule. It shows them putting a curved piece of material in the window and taking a shot of the earth. It gives it the shape of a globe. I believe personally it was taken in low orbit and they never made it to the moon. Whether you believe it or not is up to you.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not saying we can't take photo's of the earth. But I believe no one has devoloped technology to get past the radiation belt. So they take satellite data and make composite photo's. And these photos they claim are full sized earth shots. They obviously are not analog. There are not even stars in the background. It has to be taken on a pan-chromatic camera so they can claim it is a "full shot" of the Earth. But there shouldn't be a need to hide the stars from the picture at all. You can't tell me we can see stars from Earth but they are somehow invisible in a picture from space.

       Actually, none of the pictures are CGI.  CGI means that they're entirely created in a computer.  You seem to be suggesting that the images are composites of many different images.  They obviously are, which is why I showed a bunch of photos showing a small part of the earth, but still showing the globe, and jesus fuck, you're actually trying to claim that they used a fucking fish eye lens for a goddamn window so they could show the earth as  a globe?  What's the proof?  the "The earth is flat, so that's the only possible explanation!"  "What about the earth is actually a globe?"  "That doesn't make any goddamn sense.  now, the sun being 32 miles in diameter, 2000 miles away, light not being able to make it across the plane of the earth, the earth being flat, and moving up at a speed of 9 m/s to simulate gravity, that makes sense!"

       There's the lunar lander from apollo 11, there's the goddamn moon, there's the earth.  Lemme guess, special fish eye lens that only works on earth and the moon, but not the lunar lander.  I mean, what does it take to prove to you that you can take a picture of the earth with a normal camera, it's just that at most distances we travel to these days, it's till just too goddamn big to take a picture of with  just one camera?
      </p>
      <p>
       And jesus fucking christ, you have to know what camera it is before you can talk about whether the photo is authentic?  Your entire argument is based on "they're all faked by NASA" then when asked why the Chinese would use an image faked by NASA you say "you don't know what camera it is.  Sorry, I need to know that before I can completely disregard it."
      </p>
      <p>
       You COMPLETELY disregard the video of the earth from the ISS, despite the fact that it CLEARLY shows a globular earth, without fish eyeing objects in the foreground.
      </p>
      <p>
       You claim that chinese picture is a scan of the earth from sattelite data, but then claim you need to know the exact model of camera they used, because reasons.
      </p>
      <p>
       I show you pictures, you claim they don't count because they're from NASA.  I show you a picture from China, you claim you need to know what camera took the picture of the large scan of sattelite data, so why the fuck do you need a camera to take a picture of that anyways.  I show you a video, and you completely ignore it.  I'm kidn of getting the idea that you don't want to argue in good faith, just say "No" and expect me to keep tryin.

       You seem to think I am arguing the earth is flat but I'm not. I am only commenting and saying I believe NASA is lying. Please reread my comments. Especially the part about the photo's being taken from pan-chromatic camera's and how that isn't an actual analog photo of the earth. Then read again how pan-chromatic camera images are made. It is exactly 100% CGI. I already said I cannot comment on the authenticity of the old apollo 11 photo's and I only stated my personal belief. Again I believe the earth is circular but in my opinion we haven't been able to get past the van allen radiation belt.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where did I say anything about fish eye lens or any shit like that. I am not saying those are NOT pictures of the earth. But that the full color versions are stitched together CGI. Which is 100% true in relation to the photo's in the blue marble collection and any photo made from satellite data gathered from the pan-chromatic camera's they use. It's not that difficult to comprehend. I personally believe the whole moon landing was faked so I believe those photo's were taken from low orbit and a trick using a crescent cut-out in the lunar window. But still with all that I do not believe the earth is flat. Just that NASA isn't able to get past the van allen radiation belt and that is why they are lying. I mean, come on, how do the lunar rovers on mars "magically" clean themselves.
      </p>

       I believe all that stuff is staged but no amount of showing me pictures and saying "see this was taken from space." When it is clearly a photo that is not far enough away to get a full shot. I do not think they are able to get far enough into space to take a full shot.

       They wouldn't need to be in on anything, especially considering they either fly based on a compass or in most cases, rely on GPS. Actual flight paths make more sense on a flat earth.

       First, compass data cannot be faked. A compass is just a magnetized needle on a low friction bearing. The needles south pole points to earths magnetic north, and the north pole to earth magnetic south. You can build one yourself. And indeed, ships, planes and other vehicles which can circumnavigate the globe had relied on these instruments for many hundreds of years. If these readings were "fake" every single navigator would need to be in on it.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for actual flight paths making "more sense" on a flat earth: no they dont. Actual flight paths follow "great circles" around the sphere. A flat earth would have to be laid out in such a way so as to preserve great circles along which planes travel. Such a flat earth would necessarily have distortions in its surface that differ from what is actually observed, as an undistorted projection of a sphere onto a plain isnt possible.

       Yes they do, look at a flat earth flight maps. 2 stop flights which shoot wildly off course north to make absurd connections actually make sense on a flat earth map, where the top of the triangle shape on a globe is actually the middle point of a straight line between the origin and the destination on a flat map. The emergency landing in Alaska from Bali to LA makes sense only if Alaska is on the way to LA from Bali, which it is, on the flat earth map, but not the globe. There are no real flights that you'd be able to take over Antarctica.

       I have no idea what obscure reference you are making. Likely there was a connection in Japan or Hong Kong, in which case you do indeed go close to Alaska. Go look at a flight path, then get a piece of string and a globe and confirm that indeed they are the shortest paths available.

       They had stopped in Taiwan from Bali to LAX, and it still would make more sense if Alaska was along the way, as it is on a flat earth map. Take that string and put it on a flat earth map from Taiwan to LA, and you'll find the string goes over Alaska.

       I know which map you are talking of, look at it, the latitude and longitude lines on it are completely distorted. Hundreds of thousands of square miles of extra land is added to make it project correctly. the map ads problems without explaining anything better than a globe.

       it could be because it just seems ridiculous to do this to disprove something like flat earth.  and even if you did, they would find SOMETHING that, in their eyes, would disprove the whole thing.  even if it was just something small and insignificant like the planes altitude not quite matching what they think the ground would look like at that height.  form there it would go into "look at that hill.  its an obvious poor photoshop" or "that cloud is the worst CGI ive ever seen!"

       Its not a "lame excuse". Flatearthers routinely dismiss gps itself, video feed from the orbiting ISS, all scientific theory pertaining to magnetism, gravity, conservation of momentum, etc, every account of travel to the south pole, every measurement of longitude and latitude ever made, etc etc. They will just say the video feed of the plane is faked or "doesnt prove anything" because it "traveled in a flat circle".

       Why would you believe this if you don't already believe air craft, satellites, space craft, and ships are circling the globe every day?

       I mean, you're going to believe GPS, which is an array of satellites orbiting the Earth, put there by the government?
      </p>
      <p>
       And to do the "experiment" you ask for would take the governments help, since no air craft has the range to do that in one go and you'd have to get permission from multiple governments to do East to West.
      </p>
      <p>
       And then, who's going to pay for it? No one cares about the flat earth conspiracy because it's long been so completely obvious it isn't, so unless flat earthers are going to pony up the money, you'll just have to be content with all the fucking evidence that exists to show the Earth is round.

       what do you mean long been so completely obvious?  im pretty sure people have had theories of the earth shape for thousands of years...

       you make a good point with the GPS, but i was trying to counteract that with open sourced and video feed.. but i see your point.

       The Earth as a round was obvious as soon as the people were traveling distances fairly routinely, especially once they were sailing open water. Astronomy is as old as dirt and once they were comparing notes, they could see that stars were at different points from the horizon depending on the distance north and south. It also explained to seafarers why ships and shores "sunk" as the distance grew.

       , says the Greeks were convinced of a round Earth by the 5th century BC, and they thought it was known for several centuries before that.
      </p>
      <p>
       The thing is with theories like flat Earth and Creationism is that their hypotheses are are not coherent. That is to say, they do not consider their explanations for one observation will impact other observations. They're always one off what ifs.
      </p>
      <p>
       And they believe no one has ever taken their theory seriously. That no one has actually and honestly considered the theories and concluded that they are wrong. And not just a person, but a history or people actually studying and arguing the two sides until until their theories were completely dismissed as false.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's where the conspiracy has to be introduced. That so many people have spend so much money to keep the lid on a fact that was deduced two thousand years ago or more, and to what purpose? Moreover, consider the CIA leaks. The CIA, an actual government entity whose job it is is conspiracy and that's known to everyone, couldn't keep their secrets. How the hell would global scientists everywhere all fail or be part of the round earth conspiracy?
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course all the pictures are CGI, if they weren't then there would be no conspiracy and no one could believe a flat Earth.

       Are the space agencies of the Soviet Union, Europe, Japan, etc all arms of NASA? Red Bull too? Go watch Felix Baumgartner's jump from a balloon from the edge of space. You can see the curvature of the Earth from a balloon. Amateurs can do this (the camera on the balloon part, not the jump.)
      </p>
      <p>
       And why would the Earth behave differently in shape than other celestial bodies, or is that all illusions and conspiracy too?

       Not a single flat earther has a reasonable explanation of why a boat would disappear bottom first when going over the horizon. That, along with observing the stars, is ample evidence proving the Earth is round.

       The boat question has been answered numerous rime. Plenty of youtube videos where they zoom in on the "disappearing" boat and the entire boat comes back into view. Nothing is behind the curvature.

      <p>
       It is due to the nature of perspective that the bottoms of faraway objects seem to disappear first. This is what the flat earthers say, at any rate.

       No, that is not true. You anywhere near the coast? Go check it out for yourself. In those videos, it's just the camera doesn't have adequate resolution to see the boat when it's zoomed out.

       Gravity is pretty elegant, but it has its problems, most notably that we struggle to integrate it with Quantum Theory. Additional problems arise when predicting the behavior of galaxies based on gravity alone, leading scientists to hypothesize the existence of Dark Energy, as well as Dark Matter.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not unthinkable that another paradigm, such as the Electric Universe Theory could manage to explain and unify these discrepancies between scales and theories. The Holo-Fractal paradigm is another interesting candidate for a theory that may bridge that gap.
      </p>
      <p>
       Point is, gravity may not be the best explanation for why things attract.

       We have yet to observe the graviton, but that doesn't mean a whole lot. All the magnetic-gravy and electric-gravity theories are considered pseudoscience for some pretty good reasons. Consider, we have a pretty potent ability to manipulate electromagnetic fields. We can build large zero gauss chambers and the like - which make faraday cages look like nothing - to cut out the electric and magnetic field interference of the Earth. If an object or persons weight were dependent on the interaction of that objects charge with the Earth's field, in some way, what do you suppose the result of reducing that to near zero would be? Venus doesn't even have a magnetic field, yet it certainly has gravity, etc. There is too much observable evidence that flies in the face of these various theories and no experiments supporting them. Too many simple experiments which can be perform to debunk them, given that not all matter is magnetic and not everything has an electric charge, that sort of thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Dealing with theoretical physics results in a lot more questions than answers until we figure out how to observe whatever we're after, but general relativity definitely stands up to the test whereas electric gravity and magnetic gravity just fall apart.

       The horizon rising to eye level is a claim that I commonly see, yet don't see any actual measurable proof of it.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can actually measure the drop of the horizon using a theodolite. An example being
       <a href="http://m.imgur.com/iB89TnJ">
        here.
       </a>
       Another one being from a plane like
       <a href="http://m.imgur.com/cBrTtzR">
        here.
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       If you, for some reason, don't trust theodolites then there are other proofs. Such as both the Moon and the horizon
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ha6PeAVLpNo">
        being below the eye level of an obersver in a plane.
       </a>
       Here's
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFj7gNh3yOM">

       You literally cannot physically feel constant velocity. One reason is because velocity is relative, so there's a reference point in which you are stationary. That's basic logic, not even (((science))).
      </p>
      <p>
       Secondly, the way your body senses motion is the fluid in your ears applying a force against your inner ear. When you are vertical, it's pulling downwards because of gravity and the brain sets that force as 0 force for benchmarking. When you move at a constant velocity, the fluid does not move and your body only feels acceleration downwards due to gravity.
      </p>
      <p>
       But when you accelerate forwards, the fluid flows backwards due to psuedoforce and the brain feels a difference in pressure, resulting in a feeling of motion. That's why going on a loop in a roller coaster doesn't have the same feeling of flying forwards since your acceleration is all downwards.

       You only feel the effects when taking off, accelerating, and the descent/braking/landing. You do not feel the motion at cruising speed. Same for a car, you do not feel yourself going 50mph, you feel acceleration and braking. A hard brake, and you'll definitely feel the laws of inertia.

       Density and buoyancy are properties of objects that only make sense in reference to some force that acts like gravity. What is the force that causes denser and less buoyant things to move towards the earth?

       I just want to reiterate this.
      </p>
      <p>
       Buoyancy refers to the way things of different density behave in the presence of gravity. Without gravity there is no 'down' to sink to or 'up' to float to.
      </p>
      <p>
       Imagine a sphere of water. Now put something buoyant in the exact center of that sphere. Which direction does it travel without gravity?

       That would actually be pretty interesting.
      </p>
      <p>
       Remember, if we're scaling down the earth to the size of a ball, then the thickness of water on the ball would also have to be scaled down.
      </p>
      <p>
       The diameter of earth is 12,742 km. The deepest part of the ocean is 10.994 km.
      </p>
      <p>
       If we divide 12,742 km by 12,742,000 we get 0.001 km or 1 metre.
      </p>
      <p>
       If we divide 10.994 km by 12,742,000 we get 0.00000086 km or 0.86 mm.
      </p>
      <p>
       So on our 1 metre diameter model of the earth, the water in the deepest part of the ocean would only be 0.86mm deep.
      </p>
      <p>
       The
       <em>
        average
       </em>
       depth of the ocean is 3.69 km.
      </p>
      <p>
       If we divide 3.69 km by 12,742,000 we get 0.00000031 km or 0.31mm.
      </p>
      <p>
       So for our experiment, we could use a 1 metre diameter ball with a layer of water on it that is 0.31mm deep.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then we spin that ball at 1 revolution per day (0.00069 revolutions per minute or 0.2484 degrees per minute.)
      </p>
      <p>
       Even without taking account of gravity, it seems to me that the water will not be flung off the surface at such a slow rotational speed. The surface tension alone will probably be enough to hold it in place.
      </p>
      <p>
       For the experiment to be more realistic, it would have to be carried out in a lab that is not feeling the effect of earth's gravity. So it could be done in a lab in orbit.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not going to be cheap, but it could be done.

       regular, but I may be able to help you out.
      </p>
      <p>
       Are you trying to say that we (assuming we live on a giant spinning rock) should be able to feel the force or angular momentum due to the earth's rotation? Well good news is we do.
      </p>
      <p>
       The formula from angular acceleration is ac =  v
       <sup>
        2
       </sup>
       / r, v = 2πr*ω, so ac = 4π
       <sup>
        2
       </sup>
       * r * ω
       <sup>
        2
       </sup>
       , where ω = 1/(one day).
      </p>
      <p>
       So ac = (4π
       <sup>
        2
       </sup>
       * 6,371,000)/(24 * 60 * 60)
       <sup>
        2
       </sup>
       = 0.03 ms
       <sup>
        2
       </sup>
       <br/>
       Gravity = 9.81 ms
       <sup>
        2
       </sup>
      </p>
      <p>
       So it's not really worth factoring in the difference considering variation in the earth's density and the fact that it's not perfectly spherical anyway.

       The satellite signal only tells us how far away the satellite is from our receiver. You need at least 4 satellites to determine a precise position. We also use satellites from countries such as Russia. Do you really think Russia is cooperating with the US to deceive the world about flat earth?

       So, just to clarify (since this is kind of an imprecise answer), you mean that when you take a straight-line measurement (using a laser?) you have to correct that measurement for the curve of the Earth in order to get it to match up with what the GPS satellites tell you?
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean, obviously you're not saying that the 'GPS coordinates' are wrong.

       Yes. One single measurement is negligible but when you add those measurements in a line over a long distance it becomes more important. (Highways)

       So, you basically came here to tell us that the Earth is round, because the GPS satellites tell you so, and you believe them.

       If you're near the coast, it's pretty simple. I can walk them through the test process for a long straight edge (ruler) and then get them to hold the straight edge up to the horizon. The horizon will noticeably curve down at the edges.

       A surveyor and engineer of thirty years published in the Birmingham Weekly Mercury stated, “I am thoroughly acquainted with the theory and practice of civil engineering. However bigoted some of our professors may be in the theory of surveying according to the prescribed rules, yet it is well known amongst us that such theoretical measurements are INCAPABLE OF ANY PRACTICAL ILLUSTRATION. All our locomotives are designed to run on what may be regarded as TRUE LEVELS or FLATS. There are, of course, partial inclines or gradients here and there, but they are always accurately defined and must be carefully traversed. But anything approaching to eight inches in the mile, increasing as the square of the distance, COULD NOT BE WORKED BY ANY ENGINE THAT WAS EVER YET CONSTRUCTED. Taking one station with another all over England and Scotland, it may be stated that all the platforms are ON THE SAME RELATIVE LEVEL. The distance between Eastern and Western coasts of England may be set down as 300 miles. If the prescribed curvature was indeed as represented, the central stations at Rugby or Warwick ought to be close upon three miles higher than a chord drawn from the two extremities. If such was the case there is not a driver or stoker within the Kingdom that would be found to take charge of the train. We can only laugh at those of your readers who seriously give us credit for such venturesome exploits, as running trains round spherical curves. Horizontal curves on levels are dangerous enough, vertical curves would be a thousand times worse, and with our rolling stock constructed as at present physically impossible.”
      </p>

       Explain that.

       It doesn't really make sense. Surveying actually does assume the world is flat for small projects and it works perfectly fine because the curvature is not drastic locally. Once you get into big projects you have to factor the curvature of the earth in otherwise you will not be able to make the measurements close on themselves.

       300 miles is a large project. That would take account of earths curvature by using procedures that cancel out that error. You can't see 300 miles away directly. You have to set the level up many times in between. Each time you set up, you create a new level line that is perpendicular to gravity. You must keep the distance between these setups small. So if you map out all these level lines, it follows the curvature of the earth.

       While I admire what you're doing, it seems to be in vain. These people don't want to be disproved, and that mindset is the true problem here. If you unconsciously cling to an idea like this, you start feeling like you've been enlightened with "The Truth™". And if you can't learn to recognize these tendencies of our human nature before it's too late, you will fall down the rabbit-hole of quackery. THAT is what's discrediting conspiracy theorists, that is the psychological complex that is hurting us.

       This. A quick cursory search into the curvature of the earth combine with a basic knowledge of working on a construction site, one can safely assume you wouldn't just level with a laser one time in 300 miles. Literally every time a new section was installed you would check it for being level and move it if needed, this will cancel out the gradual curve of the earth, making it a non factor.

       I've no idea what the elevations are as this track goes from point 'A' to point 'B' or the elevation markers in between but according to your remark above how much curvature is at play here?

       The curvature is only important for determining distance. It does not affect straightness. Here's a video explaining the

       Gravity. As the earth moves, you aren't going over a hill per-say, as the gravity is always pulling toward the center of the earth.
      </p>
      <p>
       But honestly, if you are going to believe the earth is flat, there's not much a rational person can tell you to change your mind. I hope you find the help you need one day.

       Actually, you may try explaining that. What you've done is copy and paste something another person has wrote, but I have significant doubts that you are able to comprehend any of this. You could've just stated it in your own words and cite the sources accordingly, but in this, you have demonstrated the true heart of the Flat-Earth Conspiracy: "We don't know what any of the data means, but ______ does! Here's one of his videos/quotes."

       Yes, they do. They account for the curved earth by being level. If they did not account for the curved earth, they would not be level and one end would eventually be out in space.
      </p>
      <p>
       The word "level" means "perpendicular to the force of gravity". On a spherical planet, a "level" line that is long enough will not be a "straight" line as it would follow the curving surface while staying perpendicular to the force of gravity.
      </p>
      <blockquote>

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Yes, they would. The direction of gravity points at the center of mass. On a spherical planet that center is at the center of the sphere. On opposite sides of the sphere, gravity is pointing in opposite directions.
      </p>
      <p>
       The affect of this is that if you move further away from the center, you are climbing, and if you move closer to the center you are falling.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you pick a point in space and call it the center, then try to draw a surface around that center that is always the same distance away from it, the surface you draw will be a sphere.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you move around on that surface you will neither be getting further away nor closer to the center. That is, you will not be climbing or descending.
      </p>
      <p>
       This "engineer" you place so much faith in seems to have no understanding of how gravity works, or even basic geometry.

       Nope.

       This person is actually rather ignorant of some basic physical realities. His claim is that the first half of the journey would be ascending against gravity, while the second half of the journey would be descending, as if the train were climbing over an enormous hill.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://i.imgur.com/1P7I8EQ.png">
        Here is a diagram of what this "engineer" is talking about
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       At the top we see the curved earth. The red line is the path of a train travelling from one side to the other.  The yellow lines indicate the direction of gravity on such a world. These lines run parallel to each other with only the center line passing through the center of the earth, while the lines to either side miss the center. On this world, travelling across the world involves climbing up against gravity on one side then descending down on the other.
      </p>
      <p>
       But what happens if we take that curved surface and flatten it out? The bottom diagram shows what happens. We now see the gravity is not pointing straight down everywhere, but is angling out from the center, becoming less perpendicular to the surface the further from the center you go. At the beginning of the journey, gravity is pushing back against the train, while at the end of the journey it is pushing the train forward.
      </p>
      <p>
       We all know that's not how gravity works... right? It's always pointing straight down... right?
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://i.imgur.com/SgOmUFN.png">
        Here is the same image with the lines of gravity corrected so that they always point to the center of earth
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Now we can see at the top that the lines of gravity are not parallel, but instead radiate out from the center of the earth so that they are always perpendicular to the surface. As the train travels along the red line, the gravity lines behind it are "pushing" it forwards as much as the gravity lines in front of it are "pushing" it backwards. This effect cancels out so that the train is neither climbing nor descending at any point of its journey.
      </p>
      <p>
       When we flatten out that world, we see the lines of gravity converge, becoming more parallel the flatter the surface gets. This shows that the gravity is pulling the train down on to the surface but not horizontally as in the first image.
      </p>
      <p>
       That is how the real world works. Travelling from one side of the curved surface to another does not involve climbing or descending as long as that surface is always the same distance from the center of the earth. Even though the train is actually travelling in a shallow arc, because the gravity is always perpendicular to the surface wherever it is, the train will not be climbing or descending and is able to move exactly the same as if it was on a flat surface with gravity pointing straight down perpendicular to the surface.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why is this so? It is because gravity is not a force traveling in one direction. It is a force that pulls towards the center of mass. On opposite sides of the world, gravity is pulling in opposite directions.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact this "engineer" does not understand such basic principles calls into question whether he is an engineer at all.

       Okay. so If the curvature of the earth is supposedly detectable at 8+ miles.. how can you say that you can prove flat earth is fake? I mean, can you even survey lets say 10 miles. point a to b and see if there is a detectable curve?
      </p>
      <p>
       My point is, there can and probably are deviations in a 3 mile wide area, ups, downs, hills, all that, but even if you did detect or have to correct for 'curvature', which also again doesn't make sense if you're not doing anything past 8 miles you shouldn't even have to worry about it right? so.. I don't get it.

       well, can you 'detect' the curve of the earth in a half a mile? because ball earth theory says it's only 'observable' at 8+ miles..

       Here you say this : " When I measure GPS coordinates, they are wrong. The further away they are, the larger the error. This is because the measurement passes through the curve of the earth. I have to correct these measurements using the the radius of the earth to reflect a surface measurement"
      </p>
      <p>
       But you also just admitted that the largest area you've ever worked on was maybe 3 miles. How, in your mind, that the GPS system is not being accurate, translate in an absolute that there is not a flat earth. Keeping in mind that the GPS is suspect as well in the flat earth theory.
      </p>
      <p>
       How does that work? Again, the curvature supposedly only matters at a distance beyond 8 miles, so even if the GPS was off, why would you have to use the supposed radius of the earth?

       For surveying imperial is actually way better.

       The only unit we use is decimal feet so there is never any unit conversion, the main disadvantage of imperial.

       Jesus fuck, the curvature is 'observable' at 8 miles, ie, to the eye.

       Obviously that doesnt mean its flat for 7.9 miles and then suddenly a curve. When you're surveying, millimeters matter.

       The Manchester Ship Canal Company published in the Earth Review stated, “It is customary in Railway and Canal constructions for all levels to be referred to a datum which is nominally horizontal and is so shown on all sections. It is not the practice in laying out Public Works to make allowances for the curvature of the earth.

       Misleading The datum is nominally horizontal in your local area. Modern vertical datums are based on what is called the geoid which is a roughly earth shaped surface modeled on earths gravity. These datums were created to allow GPS technology to be incorporated more fluently into the profession. As you level across the surface the level line is always perpendicular to gravity. To avoid error, you have to keep your back measurements and forward measurements the same. This cancels out the effect of the curved earth. If we didn't do this then error would occur. So yes for simplicity of math we level as though the world was flat, but we have to measure in a certain WAY to still produce the correct result. GPS has totally changed the game though and is wholly dependent on a curved model called the geoid to produce correct results.

       It would be stronger because it chips away one piece of evidence but still wrong. If a traverse a large distance and return to my starting point, I will have new coordinates at my starting point due to the earths curvature. Same can be said if I run a large level loop and return to my starting point if I intentionally made my back and forward measurements different lengths.

       By definition if you return to your starting point you would have the same coordinates in either scenario, and intentionally making your back and forward measures different and ending up in a different location seems like a no brainer.

       You will have different coordinates if you do not account for spherical trigonometry over long distances. The angles measured on a flat earth would not have that problem.

       has just provided very solid evidence against the Flat Earth Theory. Why not do your own research to find a rebuttal rather than, "Government owns GPS!" That is the conspiracy cop-out right there.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you really cared about uncovering an objective truth, you would do your own homework and look at the data for yourself.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not even arguing against a Flat Earth, I'm simply encouraging you to recognize your own biases. Conspiracy Theorists should hold an attitude of the utmost skepticism, but what you've demonstrated is anything but that; it's an almost fervent hope that the world actually is flat.

       It's not a cop-out. If anything it's more evidence that the Earth is flat and the government(s) is covering it up.

       You've completely dodged the point because it's something you don't want to hear. It may be evidence for something, but you drawing correlations between the two further prove that you're operating on confirmation bias.

       The government isn't some singular entity. It is made up of disparate elements who work most independently of each other. If you ever worked in government you would know how disorganized most things are.

      <p>
       Yes, there are and have been proven high-level conspiracies within government. There is not, however, a need for the earth to be round for the elite to control the populace. Stop being silly!

       I can't speak for high levels of regular government, but the IC is plenty disorganized. Even SAPs are only available to relatively small groups of people and most of the conspiracies you hear about are rogue elements because there are oversight policies in place all the way to the top which prevent misuse of power.

       It's a simple way to check if you are full of shit, and you are. Don't try to misrepresent yourself. Even someone at the lowest levels knows their caveats. I had (not working and out of scope now) the basic set SI, TK, H, GCS plus one SAP.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's fine to believe conspiracies, but stop trying to misrepresent yourself as a secret squirrel as some kind of subtle appeal to authority.

       Second-guessing the establishment is healthy, but you need to learn to second-guess yourself and your beliefs as well.

       extremely expensive how?  a plane ride from cali to NY is like 500... cant be more than 50k to do this lol. .... and yea satisfy a THEORY to the shape of the earth thats been argued for millenia is not important?  yea ok bro

       Are you telling me you think the price you pay for a ticket from NY to Cali is what it costs the airline to do the flight? You people are dumber than I thought.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's only argued by a few fringe weirdos. Everybody else is satisfied. If you think it's going to be so cheap and easy to do this flight that you seem to think is going to staisfy flat earthers, why don't you and your buddies get together and crowd fund it? Why do you expect sane people who already know the earth is round to do it for you?

       It's like if I said I believed there's a teapot orbiting the sun and the proof that it's real is that the government refuses to fund a mission to prove otherwise.

       Modern practices is a misleading distraction piece. We have statements from a century ago (i.e. before the advent of GPS or anyone technological crutch you'd like to invoke) stating that railway stretching from Manchester to London assumes a flat surface. Datum lines prior to your GPS voodoo could not magically assume a curve. A datum line is a fixed horizontal line, not a
       <em>
        relatively

       horizontal line. GPS is fucking great but I doubt it has the power bend facts.

       OP will answer this better than I, but i think it has to do with using benchmarks when you survey - they are basically just points of reference when you start taking spot shots across a project site.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you are working on a vertical construction project, like a building, the extents of your site footprint are fairly small horizontally - you can use one benchmark and the curvature of earth will have a very minor effect over such a small area - but horizontal construction, something like a railroad that extends distant lengths, the curvature really begins to play a role in the topography, and it becomes a little complicated to weigh rolling topography and the drop off due to curvature.

       Most project site coordinates are on a State Plane coordinate system. They are usually converted from grid to a ground datum via a couple established gps points. The Grid to Ground conversion is done with an Adjustment factor.
      </p>
      <p>
       On small sites you generally just take 2 established GPS points and use the mid point as the base point of adjustment.
      </p>
      <p>
       With it converted to ground coordinates you might as well consider it as an assumed coordinate relating only to that localized site. If you want to relate it with other projects you need to apply the adjustment factor and use the Base point of adjustment to convert your coordinates back to grid. The elevation does not change in the conversion, only Horizontally.

       Go rent a Trimble handheld gps unit and start walking along train tracks and taking elevation shots as you walk.  Learn about how the satellite post-corrections work.  Then compare this with just taking some survey shots around your property.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do a little survey work yourself - if you aren't going to believe other people explaining the process to you, then the best thing you can do is just try it yourself - its easy and fun.  And its available for you to solve.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or pay a surveyor a days work to walk around with you and show you how it works - theres a million ways you can solve this problem on your own

       Ok, here's a good one. I'll go get the maths if you're still not satisfied.
      </p>
      <p>
       I work in mining, and we sink vertical shafts. The place I used to work at has a bit over 2km between two of these vertical shafts and they both drop to about 1200m deep. At the bottom they both branch off into the mining levels which have been connected. We surveyed between the two shafts to confirm we'd done our job properly.
      </p>
      <p>
       The distance between the two shafts at 1200m deep is less then the distance between them on the surface.

      <p>
       Put simply, saying a datum is "nominally horizontal" is another way of saying "the difference between the datum and a true horizontal line is small enough to be ignored for our purposes".
      </p>
      <p>
       The curvature of the earth is relatively small and because of how gravity works, a railway line that follows the curvature will be "level" at each part of the track, even though it is not truly horizontal.
      </p>
      <p>
       In this case, a long "level" track can be called "nominally horizontal" for the purposes of designing the track.

       Definition:
A datum is theoretical exact plane, axis or point location that GD&amp;T or dimensional tolerances are referenced to. You can think of them as an anchor for the entire part; where the other features are referenced from. A datum feature is usually an important functional feature that needs to be controlled during measurement as well.

       All GD&amp;T symbols except for the form tolerances (straightness, flatness, circularity and cylindricity) can use datums to help specify what geometrical control is needed on the part. When it comes to GD&amp;T, datum symbols are your starting points where all other features are referenced from.

       Go to the north pole. Look at Sirius how bright it looks. Then go south to the equator. You can see Sirius. It is as bright as before. The go south. At some point Sirius will vanish. Go back a few miles then observe Sirius again. Keep staring until you're eaten by a large cat.

       Who knows, start trying to do some cosmology research and see how many goddamn roadblocks you run into, how many censored docs you have to go through.. you have to question everything. Nasa has thousands of satelites up there, very few of them provide publicly accessible data...but why is it so hard to find detailed images of Antarctica? North pole? It goes on and on man. nasa = Never A Straight Answer

       Yeah but even actors can come equipped with facts and a degree from a university. Maybe they are a bit skewed but their biggest fight right now is climate change. It's not just the polar icecaps melting, it's the effects of large amounts of carbon and methane and their effect on agricultural production. Imagine if randomly the rural farm states became a desert.

      <p>
       Hey, it's possible it could happen naturally but there is usually a cause.

       Btw they are basically interviewed by actors.

       Dude, look up Euler's theorema egregium. It's a mathematical proof that the curvature of a sphere cannot be projected onto a flat surface without sacrificing one or more of the geometric properties: accurate angles, lengths, areas, etc...
      </p>
      <p>
       Take it up with Zermelo and Fraenkel (or maybe shoot an email to Jacob Laurie to see if higher topos theory is more to your liking) if you don't like the laws of mathematics but that is the only reason an "ideal" map doesn't exist.

       Globes do accurately represent the round earth, I don't know what you mean by that. Read
       <a href="https://qz.com/458826/behold-nasas-first-image-in-decades-of-the-whole-earth/">
        this article
       </a>
       to see why most of the modern photos of the earth were panormas stiched together. As to why the UN uses the flat earth map? The flat earth map is one of dozens of projections of the earth onto a flat surface so maybe they picked it in an effort to an choose a map that may minimize favoring certain regions over another (I.e. a pictorial representation of the globalist agenda). Think about it that map is unique in that it depicts Antartica (and really only Antarctica) as unnaturally distorted which is a non issue since Antarctica has no cultural relevance.

       I'll agree to disagree, because this is just one of thousands of models of earth's shape. I suggest reading up on the grace /goce satelites a bit more though because that was not my interpretation of the data these satelites produce. I've read the article you provided and it doesn't really back up your claim.

       It's not a model of it's shape! Good Lord it's a fancy diagram. Reading up on the sattelites in the article isn't going to help if you couldn't gather from the article that the image isn't the shape of the earth.

       I agree, if I hadn't already seen it in the correct context I could see coming away with that impression. The problem to me as that any massive 1000 miles bubble rising out of the earth would have been a feature discovered by the people who live around it hundreds if not thousands of years ago. Any Journalist is gonna want to spice up their work with all sorts of wacky incorrect claims. All in all though I agree with you, journalism shouldn't be setting out to confuse the shit out of people but that seems to be their Modus Operandi these days.

       It's flat man, one time a guy said that there are special devices on boats that are tuned to the curvature of the earth. He said that as they got farther away they'd pick up on higher areas of the boat, meaning that the earth is curved.

       Polaris, as in the north star?  How do you explain the precession of the Earth's rotational axis?  Polaris won't always be the "north star" due to this precession.  Does this not occur in your model?
      </p>
      <p>
       Sorry to butt in, but I'm curious how the FE model accounts these things.

       It will. People just assume since they notice stuff moving that it will always be/always has. As it's moving closer to the center point of our "rotation" it's effectively charging the sun causing "global warming".

       It doesn't account for those things. Flat earthers just ignore, deny, and misinterpret all legitimate evidence. They rely on people on the internet who have layman's understandings of physics and astronomy to fuel their beliefs.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like the position of Polaris, as you said, and long-exposure photographs of stars. Compare images from the northern hemisphere, southern hemisphere, and equator. At the equator, long exposure images will show the stars taking a straight path across the sky.  Further north/south, the stars appear to take a curved path.
      </p>
      <p>
       That apparent movement makes perfect sense in a round earth model. There's 0 explanation for those on a flat Earth model. That's one of the easiest proofs against a flat Earth. Others include Earth's shadow on the moon, measurements of gravity, a Foucalt pendulum... I could go on. I just think flat earthers fall into a a category of people who are just dangerously stupid, because they are able to believe nonsense in the face of all contradicting evidence. It shows they are unwilling to accept facts once they find an opinion that they like best. There's a reason most flat earthers believe the exact same set of conspiracies.

       Sorry but this is totally wrong. Magnetism is a problem that is being misrepresented in academia so you wouldn't know. Frankly whatever science you think you understand should be triple checked and somehow I don't think that is happening. Stating creditials upfront makes you sound pretentious. If you think scatter gun labelling people crazy is going convince anyone with a brain, you're fucking nuts. Don't overestimate yourself lest you come across as a zealot protecting a dying religion.

       I will answer this the best I can. To address his answer simply a flat disk shaped magnet will have one point for north and the ring around the edge will display south.

       Flat Earthers claim that surveyors, engineers and architects are never required to factor the supposed curvature of the Earth into their projects, providing proof that the world is a plane, not a planet.  Canals and railways, for example, are always cut and laid horizontally, often over hundreds of miles, without any allowance for curvature.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you factor in the Earth's curvature?

       Did you notice the use of the word "level" in that statement? Do you know that "level" and "flat" do not mean the same thing?
      </p>
      <p>
       A line can be totally level, and yet form a complete circle.
      </p>
      <p>
       How? Because level is defined as a line that is perpendicular to the force of gravity, and gravity is a force that points towards the center of mass.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://i.imgur.com/524qR71.png">
        Here is a simplified diagram of earth and its gravity
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       The green circle is earth, the black lines are gravitational directions of force. As you can see both black lines meet at the center of the green circle but are perpendicular to the circle where they cross it. That's how gravity works on a sphere.
      </p>
      <p>
       The red lines are drawn perpendicular to the lines of gravity. They are "level", but they are not flat. In fact they form a 90
       <sup>
        o
       </sup>
       angle to each other.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you continue drawing black lines between these two, meeting at the center of the circle but remaining perpendicular to the surface you will start building a curve. With enough black lines, the red lines would form a perfect circle, but they'd still be level.

       If the Earth is not flat, then prove to me why air lines fly slower going east to west, and faster west to east? It is to simulate the rotation they try and tell us is real.

       The reason planes go slower heading west is because they are flying into head winds. Head winds caused by coreollis effect from the rotation of the earth.

       A Surveyor and Engineer of thirty years wrote to the Birmingham Weekly Mercury, Feb. 15th, 1890 stating, “I am thoroughly acquainted with the theory and practice of civil engineering.  However bigoted some of our professors may be in the theory of surveying according to the prescribed rules, yet it is well known amongst us that such theoretical measurements are INCAPABLE OF ANY PRACTICAL ILLUSTRATION.  All our locomotives are designed to run on what may be regarded as TRUE LEVELS or FLATS.  There are, of course, partial inclines or gradients here and there, but they are always accurately defined and must be carefully traversed.  But anything approaching to eight inches in the mile, increasing as the square of the distance, COULD NOT BE WORKED BY ANY ENGINE THAT WAS EVER YET CONSTRUCTED.  Taking one station with another all over England and Scotland, it may be stated that all the platforms are ON THE SAME RELATIVE LEVEL.  The distance between Eastern and Western coasts of England may be set down as 300 miles.  If the prescribed curvature was indeed as represented, the central stations at Rugby or Warwick ought to be close upon three miles higher than a chord drawn from the two extremities.  If such was the case there is not a driver or stoker within the Kingdom that would be found to take charge of the train.  We can only laugh at those of your readers who seriously give us credit for such venturesome exploits, as running trains round spherical curves.  Horizontal curves on levels are dangerous enough, vertical curves would be a thousand times worse, and with our rolling stock constructed as at present physically impossible.”

       300 miles is a large project. That would take account of earths curvature by using procedures that cancel out that error. You can't see 300 miles away directly. You have to set the level up many times in between. Each time you set up, you create a new level line that is perpendicular to gravity. You must keep the distance between these setups small. So if you map out all these level lines, it follows the curvature of the earth.

       Flat earth is the most fun conspiracy I follow.. I believe he earth is a globe, don't think I've really ever questioned it, but there's something about watching flat earth videos or reading papers that interests the shit out of me haha. I'd say the truest part of that conspiracy is the fact that NASA does get into some shady things and are controlled by the government.. beyond that I don't think they're trying, or even can, hide the fact that the Earth is flat. People use the excuse that you can't keep a secret that big for 9/11 defenses, but I'd argue this is a secret WAY to be big to keep hidden for all these years... it'd be funny as fuck if it turned out to be true lol

       I'm a former civil engineer.  You don't need complex explanations about gravity and curvature to know the flat earth models are wrong... you can't have the sun rise due east everywhere on a flat earth twice per year.

       They have been answered only to fall on deaf ears. I'm sure you're aware a large portion of your growing body of "believers" are most likely trolls trying to see how fucking stupid they can make the "theory" get. If you would like I'll link you to an accurate mathematical model of an observer on the surface of the earth so you'll see that the lynch pin of round earth (you know the tangent line on the circle can only see so far) is just bunk, it's assuming our eyes are somehow fixed to the surface of the earth and that we are always at elevation 0.00000...

       It's largely the same claim over and over again with minor changes. Best example to disprove would be the Statue of Liberty one because there are like four dozen of that claim over and over again.
      </p>
      <p>
       First problem: there's no proofs given, it's just empty claims. All he's doing is claiming that you can see the Statue of Liberty, he doesn't give you a reason to believe him at all. Not even a measly picture.
      </p>
      <p>
       Second problem: he doesn't give you any information to recreate his "experiment" (not to imply that I think he's ever done this experiment). Where was he when he supposedly saw the Statue? "60 miles away" is a circle with a circumference of nearly 400 miles in three states - no one could follow up if they wanted to because of this.
      </p>
      <p>
       Third problem: this claim isn't true. I'm about 60 miles away from the Statue of Liberty and I can't see it right now. Of course, flat earthers will claim that my vision is being blocked by trees and hills and buildings - and I would agree! Therefore, the location the author must have been in to truthfully make this claim has to be somewhere on
       <a href="http://i.imgur.com/Tf1qlyD.png">
        this circle
       </a>
       that is not being blocked by hills, trees, buildings, etc. It should be really obvious that this isn't possible because New York Harbor is surrounded by buildings, trees, and hills.

       I actually just made
       <a href="https://ggbm.at/GggKT2CG">
        this
       </a>
       to demonstrate what I was trying to say. The scale is really fucked (x:y is 2000:1) so this great circle of the earth looks more like a parabola but it's the only way to get all the points in one view (the units are in feet so we're looking at a 21 million foot radius circle here so hopefully that's not too upsetting). The flat red line is the standard flat earther perspective whereas the point G and the intersecting horizon line represents someone only one foot above sea level and the value is the distance in feet from the observer (So a little over a mile is now the horizon line only one foot off the ground which means you can see things that are over a foot tall from this perspective from 2 miles away). The lowest point J is the point of horizon for someone 15 feet above sea level and is about 5 miles away (15 feet above sea level gives you a 10 mile line of sight for things just over 15 feet tall). Now hopefully you see in any other demo like this they forget your line of sight can drop below a perfect horizontal gaze at 0 feet above sea level (probably because they believe in the fictitious "law of perspective"). Hopefully that satisfies your debunking need because I ain't makin' no YouTube video.

       Everest is 5.5 miles above sea level, the earth's diameter is 8,000 miles. If you were Atlas holding up the earth the himalayas would feel slightly courser than sandpaper, and the oceans' floor would feel like a wet rag.

       So some random internet user says he is a land surveyor and tells everyone the earth is not flat... And that is the end of the debate eh?
      </p>
      <p>
       There is evidence that the earth is not a globe and that TPTB have been pushing a false narrative about the nature of earth for generations.
      </p>
      <p>
       I get that its hard for people to see, cuz it was hard for me at first. But when you get past the brainwashing and overbearing shilling dealing with this particular conspiracy, it really is as clear as day.

       <a href="https://youtu.be/h5i_iDyUTCg">
        This
       </a>
       video is the fairest, most level headed summary of the "Flat" earth conspiracy I have seen yet. Watch it at least twice with an open mind before you give into the blatantly desperate peer pressure to laugh at the idea that the earth is not a globe.
      </p>
      <p>
       And remember some key points....
      </p>
      <p>
       TPTB have the motive, means and opportunity to lie about the nature of the earth.
       <br/>
       "Gravity" can not be proven or reproduced with the scientific method.
       <br/>
       "Gravitational" effects can be explained by the laws of density, motion and there being a natural up and down.
       <br/>
       The "setting" and "rising" sun can be explained by the laws of perspective.
       <br/>
       The deepest dig on record is ~8 miles.
       <br/>
       Multiple advanced civilizations of the past recorded that the earth was "flat" and the idea of a globe earth has continuously been contested since its inception.
       <br/>
       There is a LOT of mis/disinfo about the "flat" earth. A lot...
       <br/>
       MOST of the "science" that "proves" the globe earth is theoretical conjecture.

         Not true. I've been in an aircraft before and have observed slight  curvature, though it's only really noticable at high altitudes such as concord flights. It's also possible to take a picture at sea level, with a normal rectilinear lens (no fisheye) if you line the camera up perfectly with the horizon. You can also use a mountain as a visual reference, you will notice it will shrink faster than perspective. Here's an iphone getting up high. No fisheye on an iphone mate, made by some total randomers, you could even do this yourself without too much hassle:

         Makes almost no sense. There's no maths here, so I can't really deduce wtf he's on about. Again, if I'm in an aircraft, I DO have to look down slightly to see the horizon.

         For the same reason we can't perceive the spin ourselves - we are all spinning with it. Relative to us, the spinning is zero. Like when you're driving at 70mph on the highway, the car ahead of you appears to be still, because you're both going the same speed.

         Ok that's just retarded. Firstly, elevation can trump curvature. More importantly, it's incorrect to say that if you move between two points on a sphere you go uphill then downhill. Get a football (soccer ball). Hold it in one hand. Put your finger on it. Don't move your finger, spin (but don't move) the ball with your other hand 45 degrees or any amount. Did your finger move up and down to get there? Nope.

         Last one, really can't be fucked anymore. LMAO this is literally the same "proof" as #4, holy shit, even the title of the video is a lie, 200 proofs my arse. Even if he doesn't repeat any others it's still 199.

       You can see how there is little curvature at ground level and then it gets more curved over time. Must be THE CGI DAEMONS or a lizard camera that gets more fisheye over time or something.

       after looking at it again...you can see some minor curve at certain points while camera is moving...and apparently he used a 4.35mm lens, which has less of the "fish eye" effect. So it makes sense that there is much less distortion. Using a better lens should remove the effect completely.

       So you're a flat earther because you think that thousands of years of science is wrong, but a few youtube videos on the internet and you're fucking sold. Nothing shady about those youtube videos of random dudes on the internet.
      </p>
      <p>
       Much less shady than the fact that we have fucking GPS, satellite phones and TV, equinoxes, different stars on each hemisphere, the ability to travel east from Europe to Asia, east from Asia to America, and east again back to Europe. For sure there is no ISS that you can see for yourself with a telescope, that, with a radio you can even use the ham frequencies to talk to the astronauts on that station as they pass overhead (
       <a href="https://amsat-uk.org/beginners/how-to-hear-the-iss/">
        https://amsat-uk.org/beginners/how-to-hear-the-iss/
       </a>
       ) , and use radio direction finding to ascertain that they are indeed coming from above you -
 and presumably at the correct altitude if you can measure the round trip time accurately enough.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's a whole fucking body of credible evidence out there but do you choose to believe that? Nah, some faceless dude on youtube will do just fine for me!

       I'm not parroting the video, I'm recommending it because it does a good job of summing it up. What is said in the video makes perfect sense to me...maybe because I had been questioning the official narrative for years before i first saw it and already had a healthy distrust of the education and scientific establishment for years for a number of reasons. I was really into spending a lot of time explaining everything point by point to try and help people understand, but it got to the point were peoples willful ignorance got overbearing and took up too much of my time and energy. Now i throw that video up and say "HERE...watch this, cuz I cant explain it much simpler." I want people to understand and see, but in the end, they got to make the choice to do so. And to do that, they have to let go. And to quote the

       ...and I'm tired man....I simply had more energy to join the conversation today.

       The nitty gritty of it imo is that TPTB want us to turn away from the truth. That we are created beings with purpose, living on a created habitat, in a created reality. TPTB want to be God...but they cant be God...the only thing they can create is a lie...

       I was hoping for more than that. As far as NASA tax dollars, that only accounts for 7 decades. The lie would to have been going on for centuries. How would the elites of the past even know whether the earth was round or flat with no technology?

       So are all the scientists either viewing, probing or postulating about the cosmos in the last 400 years really just superfans of the billion year movie God is projecting over our head?
      </p>
      <p>
       Number 1 on that video is already hideously incorect (you would have to look down no matter how large the ball is
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        what he forgot to say was that the angle you have to look down is proportional to the observer's height and the radius of the sphere: hence hundredths of an arcsecond for a height to radius ratio of something like 6 parts in 21 million feet...
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       and on a side note, those "proofs" where they draw tangent lines on a circle like our eyes exist glued flat to the local curvature of the earth is bullshit too, try making a model where the observer is not on the circle but maybe 5 or 10 feet above, and allow their perspective to drop to the horizon and just like that round earth makes sense again, it wasn't the roundness that was the problem it was the impact of a stupid person making a stupid "proof" for gullible non-mathematically minded people.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just because you don't understand the Levi Civita connection and local intrinsic curvature on a riemannian manifold doesn't mean the universe doesn't conform highly to a model that crucially relies on these concepts. Don't get me wrong, modern physics is absolutely not the final answer, only the newest version of a mathematical toy that happens to behave to a spooky degree like the universe, that's it. The circle and tangent line thing is just like the pre-babylonian alpha version of that machine.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even Eratosthenes had figured the earth had curvature more than 2000 years ago which leads me to believe this flat earth thing is a culturally hip phenomenon, it's been out of style for so long that people naturally want to cling to it.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I'll keep watching, I imagine by the second time I'll have lost so many neurons I'll stop being able to do my job so I can ride the flat earth bandwagon straight to the Nazi guarded icewall and become a true truth warrior!

       Im familiar with it. The Cavendish Experiment is one of the very best examples of pseudo science. It basically explains gravity as "mass attracting mass" which is beyond ridiculous. His experiment is impossible to do in a controlled environment because mass is nearly EVERYWHERE. He did it in a barn...on the earth....smh. It was a piece of tripe that TPTB gobbled up and has been regurgitating to naive "students" for years. Gravity has not been proven or reproduced. Because it doesn't exist.

       The Cavendish Experiment doesn't work...period. And you are aware that there is this thing called density, and that there are basic rules/definitions that determines how dense something is correct? I know the "laws of density" isn't as common of a term as the "Laws of motion" but there are is in fact variables that determine if one thing is more dense or less dense than another thing...

       Obviously you're not. The Cavendish Experiment measures a gravitational force orthogonal to the Earth's gravity, therefore the Earth doesn't affect it. There's not much mass on that plane except the lead balls used in the experiment.

       No, you're so obviously not familiar with it. Cavendish went to extreme lengths to limit sources of error in his experiment - the fact that you think he didn't think of temperature betrays just how ignorant you are.

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The mass of the Earth does not affect the experiment because the experiment is not sensitive to vertical gravitational forces. The experiment is essentially measuring the twisting of a hanging wire - the twist comes from horizontal forces, not vertical forces. Therefore, the mass of the Earth doesn't affect the experiment. The only mass that affects the experiment is mass that is on the horizontal plane.
      </p>
      <p>
       Other mass on that plane will technically have an effect, but since the masses are so small and so far away the uncertainty is really small. This is a dumb argument for you to make, because you're not disputing the strength of gravity, you're disputing the existence. Whether or not it is a fraction of a percent stronger or weaker is not helping your denial.

       I live about 60 miles from New York City, so I was hoping I could do this experiment myself. It's always seemed odd to me that you guys constantly claim that this is possible, but no one has ever posted a picture of the Statue of Liberty from 60 miles away or a location so that I can do the experiment myself. Is proof really too much to ask of a "proof"?

        The mass of the Earth does not affect the experiment because the experiment is not sensitive to vertical gravitational forces. The experiment is essentially measuring the twisting of a hanging wire - the twist comes from horizontal forces, not vertical forces. Therefore, the mass of the Earth doesn't affect the experiment. The only mass that affects the experiment is mass that is on the horizontal plane.
Other mass on that plane will technically have an effect, but since the masses are so small and so far away the uncertainty is really small. This is a dumb argument for you to make, because you're not disputing the strength of gravity, you're disputing the existence. Whether or not it is a fraction of a percent stronger or weaker is not helping your denial.

       If gravity is real, why on earth do you believe that any experiment would not be sensitive to "vertical gravitational forces"?

      <p>
       If earths gravity supposedly pulls everything on earths surface, in its atmosphere, and even in the surrounding outer space, to the center of the earth, how can you say with a straight face that an experiment conducted on the surface of the earth is not effected by that gravity? I mean, that really makes no sense to me at all...

        I live about 60 miles from New York City, so I was hoping I could do this experiment myself. It's always seemed odd to me that you guys constantly claim that this is possible, but no one has ever posted a picture of the Statue of Liberty from 60 miles away or a location so that I can do the experiment myself.

       You're trying to compare fundamentally incomparable things. A door falls to the ground due to gravity, and water falls to the ground gravity. The door is held off the ground by a hinge, but the water is not held off the ground by anything. The question you're asking has very little to do with the strength of gravity because it's the same for both oceans and doors - the difference is in the hinge's electromagnetic forces.

       This kind of statement doesn't make sense.

      <p>
       It's trivially true that the gravitational force on a door is weaker than the gravitational force on an ocean because the force of gravity is a product of mass - oceans have larger masses than doors, and therefore oceans experience larger gravitational forces than doors.
      </p>

       I suppose what you're actually asking is why is the electromagnetic force of the hinge stronger than the gravitational force of the Earth?

       What do people have to gain by proving earth is flat.

       The major flaw in their theory is that if the earth is flat, it would have edges or drop offs into space.  Where are these edges?

       They most common theory I have seen is that there is no edge, but rather antartica is a giant "ice wall" that no one has ever actually crossed. There are about a million other arguments against a flat earth, but theyll always just say actual evidence for a globe is elaborately manufactured.

       You'd think that one of them would gather up enough wealth, and just sail to the South Pole and prove themselves right. Or get a pilot's license/charter a jet and prove themselves right. Or get some equipment and prove themselves right. Or get a degree in physics or astronomy or aerospace engineering, get a job at a government aerospace department and prove themselves right.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's pretty funny. Any method they could use to prove their conspiracy that involves anything other than sitting at their computers all day never happens. You'd think a pilot, or aerospace engineer, or a worker from NASA, or a worker from SpaceX, or a worker from [insert 1 of the 1000+ aerospace firms that helps put shit into space here] would come forward and explain specifically how people are faking a round earth. Oh well. I'm sure they'll have arguments that don't involve misunderstanding science one day...

       This means if your feet ever leave the ground on a flying airplane you would suddenly find yourself flying 600mph into the back... Are you ok with that or are airplanes just reality simulation devices?

       You absolutely will end up farther in the rear of the cabin if you jump straight up in a moving plane.
      </p>
      <p>
       While you are in contact with the plane...sitting in a seat, or even standing still in the isle, you are moving at the speed the plane is moving. As soon as you jump up and stop making contact with the plane, momentum will still be moving you forward but at a decreasing rate (slower and slower than the plane is moving forward until you stop or until another force continues your movement), and you will land further back in the planes cabin. If you were able to discontinue contact with the plane long enough, the rear of the plane, which is moving forward faster than your forward motion, will catch up to your position in space.
      </p>
      <p>
       A very easy way to test this (and its movement/momentum that you are testing) is to go into an elevator, the faster and taller the better, and jump while its in full motion. If the elevator is going up, your jump will be shortened because the elevator will catch up to your feet. If the elevator is going down your jump will be extended, giving you more of the falling feeling, because it will take longer for you to catch up to the floor( unless the elevator is moving at free fall speed...but i wouldn't want to be in an elevator going down that fast).
      </p>
      <p>
       And another great way to test it is if you can get onto one of those moving floor type things they have at some airports. Get on one and mark your position on the moving floor (which can represent the supposed moving earth beneath us) jump straight up....you will land behind the mark, and the faster the floor is moving, the farther behind the mark you made you will end up.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the earth beneath our feet, and this point is made very clear in the video i linked earlier, was really moving as fast as "science" claims or at all for that matter, that motion would be detectable by our senses and observations....but it is not detectable...cuz its not moving. They claim the visual movement of the heavens is proof that the earth is in motion, but for that to be true, you have to ignore the laws of motion and your physical senses. The heavens appear to be moving above us because they are in fact moving above us....not because we are moving below....and if we were moving we would be able to verify that motion by observing things other than the heavens above us, and we would be able to physically feel that motion, just as we see and feel our motion when we move, fall etc etc...

       I respectfully disagree, but if you have been indoctrinated as most people have, i can see why you think it is. As i said, everything I described can be easily tested yourself...so feel free to do so. If you do the experiments honestly, you will come to the same results.

       Aristotle's ideas of motion have been discredited for centuries, and they pre-date the concept of momentum. You can't claim that something that is not momentum is momentum. You have a severe misunderstanding of how motion and momentum works. Momentum is never destroyed like you claim. Your claims are nonsensical.

       You would not be able to feel it.  If you are driving and accelerate up to 60mph you can feel the acceleration, but once you are at speed, theres is no sense of movement that you would have besides the visual aspect, which is like what? Oh the heavens moving in the sky.

       Are you honestly telling me the only way you can tell you are moving in a car traveling 60mph is by looking out a window? I mean i know some people are more sensitive to movement than others, but come man....feel the force....
      </p>
      <p>
       One can feel their skin move through the atmosphere (roll down a window and put your arm out) hear the tires move along the road...and some people are so sensitive to movement that they can physically sick...even when they shut their eyes.
      </p>
      <p>
       You don't feel, hear, smell, or taste the supposed movement of the earth because its not moving....they tell you you can see it, but if the earth was really moving, you would be able to sense it with more than your eyes.

       You can feel the wind with the windows down because youre moving at a different speed than everything else, if everything else were also moving that 60 mph as well it would feel like you were standing still.  Motion sickness is caused by rocking motions not the actual act of moving forward.

       I'm very suspicious of most events, but I too am starting to believe that it's just misinformation. I am a follower of space weather and it's effects on our planet. This is one area where I believe the flat earth model doesn't fit. I will still look into it more and entertain ideas, but I'm leaning towards it being a globe.

       you are right it's not "flat" flat is a misnomer. A term used to simplify a complex topic. Obviously we have mountains and canyons not many areas are truly flat. However, we do not live on a globe, a sphere, a oblate spheroid, etc. It's not spinning either, or moving in anyway. We are stationary. not a ball.

         Weather balloons are cheap to make (around 150$). Have you thought about putting a camera with no lens on one to prove the earth is round?

       Flat earthers will never change their minds. No level of proof is good enough for them. Anything disproving flat earth is dismissed as fake news to them.
      </p>
      <p>
       If I really was lied to about the shape of the Earth, then I'd absolutely accept flat Earth as real Earth, but flat Earth has no evidence in its favour.
      </p>
      <p>
       Flat Earthers, by 'evidence' I mean actual irrefutable proof. All the supposed evidence for the flat earth is a theory based on ignorance of how the round-Earth model really works.

       Gravity acts from every object. Put a ball on a string near a brick wall and the ball will be attracted to the wall.
      </p>
      <p>
       In this experiment, were the earth flat, then the canal would be flat, and could be measured as such, by putting a laser on a boat and measuring its height on a wall on the other end, then moving the boat closer to the wall, and looking for any height change.

       If the earth is really a globe after all, this whole push for a flat earth conspiracy could just be an agenda for the TPTB to discredit conspiracy theorists. They're getting exposed on just about every false flag out there. This to me is a realistic motive on their part to take the steam out of the truth movement.

       it's gotta be the live feed from the ISS right?  Or the fact that stars are different in Australia.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or just ask who benefits From a flat earth?  In most legitimate conspiracies it's because somebody in a position of power benefits from the disguised actions.  A conspiracy that big has to have some serious benefits for somebody.  If you ask who benefits, you'll probably at least get to the heart of their belief.
      </p>
      <p>
       Usually it comes down to a belief that science itself is a conspiracy.  If they think that, then there wouldn't be an easy and irrefutable proof.

ISS feed is faked. "They" just don't know much about stars yet. No answer on who benefits. Yep, seeming like a lost cause for me to convince my friend that the FE theory is a distraction/disinformation, which is what I believe. Thanks for your reply, tho

       What are your thoughts about Surveyors who refuse to learn the office side of things. I have met many Surveyors who want nothing to do with the office, but for me I love Field to Finish.

       There is nothing more satisfying than performing a complete topo and bring it into auto cad and mapping it up. I even create legals and Right of Way plans now.

       I spent years self teaching myself Land desktop and Civil3d, but I never desired to go get my PS. Do you have a PS or desire to get one if do not have one already?

       I love the soup to nuts process but prefer office over field if I had to pick one due to winter. I passed parts 1&amp;2 and just finished part 3 on Friday. They said it will take 3 months to send my results to me but I'm pretty confident I passed. It's well worth obtaining because the supply of surveyors is so much lower than demand (At least in my area) Definitely a tight community especially considering how many father son businesses there are. My dad is a PLS and I always hit it off well with other surveyors' sons.

       I'm in New York. They still let you take the test with experience but they're a lot stricter with those applicants. I got the degree though because my dad was a surveyor and I knew I wanted to do that.

       does your company insist on taking adavantage of the one call system and call in free locates simply to turn around and resell the information gained from the locates whilst knowing the usual size of the locate you call in takes several hours for the locators to mark out with no profit for the companies who are responsible for preforming the locates when you could easily get the information you need from submitting a boundary survey and requesting prints... and do you ever wonder why those locates are shitty when your average utility locator does over 50+ locates a day.

       that sucks,  in MN we can give you prints the important stuff  like phone lines to banks and police stations arent on them to begin with. Surveryors should be able to have access to basic prints otherwise the locating companies lose hundreds of dollars an hour painting out large surveys, every locate is paid out by utility per locate not per time. So if I spend 5 hours marking 4 utilities my company gets paid the same as if I spend 5 minutes at your house marking your electric phone water sewer and gas line.

       My god this thread. Thanks for making this OP it's really opened my eyes that no matter how stupid you think people are there are always people way, way more stupid than that. The scientific literacy by the flat earthers is astonishingly low and I really didn't think there were that many ardent believers.

       When dealing with an idea this weird you gotta think outside the box.  I've talked with flat earthers who would show you some pretty remarkable systems that could produce much of what we observe in the night sky.

       Obviously in the end, flat earth is fully ridiculous, but whenever I stumble on a new conspiracy theory, I don't just take an easy answer and call it a day.

       I have a good reason for most people to look into why the earth is round. It has to do with wave propagation. So if we lived on a flat earth there wound be seemingly no horizon to interfere with radio signals and long distance communication would be very easy to transmit even with low frequency signals. Now with communication, there are ground waves or sky waves. Ground waves use line of sight to transfer information, sky waves use the ionosphere to bounce off of to avoid obstacles in the way, the issue with a flat earth means there would never truly be a reason to bounce off of the sky, and if you did the angle of incidence would be too great losing the data. Now with sky waves if you want to communicate with radio waves over the horizon you use a high frequency signal bounced off of the sky to reach where you are trying to communicate with, high frequency is better as there is more information that can be encoded in the wave as well as it isn't as disturbed by atmospheric conditions, it has the right velocity to actually utilize the curvature of the earth to its benefit and it's packet loss and clarity is much higher.

       Let's say I'm on the shore of an imaginary perfectly calm Pacific in California and I had a billion pieces of perfectly level railroad track, and kept adding a section of track, always maintaining perfect level for the ever-lengthening creation---totally stiff--the leading end moving out across the calm ocean. Let's say starting out at 5 feet above the water. Would the leading end of track eventually start moving away from the earth and into space? Or, since level is always being maintained, would the track remain at 5 feet above the water and curve with the earth?

       You would have to run this with multiple setups of the level. Each setup would be perpendicular to gravity. So each level setup would have an ever so slightly different plane than the preceding setup. The succession of these setups follows the shape of the earth. So it would maintain 5 feet above the water. If it was possible to lay the whole thing out from a single level setup, then it would move off the water.

       In this meager thought experiment, when the steel is connected, each section fits in place with no bend in the connection. It essentially makes the rail one flush continued line.
      </p>
      <p>
       So the extended rail would curve? It wouldn't be a straight line into space? How would the stiff steel curve?
      </p>
      <p>
       I hope you understand what I'm getting at. Imagine a ball with a straight line on top of it. The line would be the steel rail, and the ball the earth. The line moves into space on either end. If someone created a line and it was perfectly level between two points on that "micro" shore, would the line of steel go into space, or would it somehow bend around the earth (gravity, warping of space-time), in essence creating a circle as it comes back to meet itself?

       It bends the whole way. Each section of track is laid at an imperceptibly small angle to the previous track.

       But when the piece is connected it locks in perfectly and not at an angle. Let's say there aren't many pieces, but one long 24,901 mile piece of straight track that comes out of theoretical "track-maker" that is perfectly level at the source (like a laser beam coming out that is perfectly level--I'm using steel instead of a laser, because I imagine the atmosphere can affect a laser beam). Would the seemingly inflexible steel rail end up in space, or bend around the earth making a complete circle?

       Because we live in a society where we are being lied to CONSTANTLY, day in and day out,, with the obvious intention to limit the competency of the general public - so naturally, people are trying to question everything, and only believe things with verifiable proof - the problem with flat earth theorists is that there is tons of verifiable proof but people are ignoring it or not taking the time to scientifically prove it for themselves

       Yeah but even actors can come equipped with facts and a degree from a university. Maybe they are a bit skewed but their biggest fight right now is climate change. It's not just the polar icecaps melting, it's the effects of large amounts of carbon and methane and their effect on agricultural production. Imagine if randomly the rural farm states became a desert.

       Hey, it's possible it could happen naturally but there is usually a cause.

       has just provided very solid evidence against the Flat Earth Theory. Why not do your own research to find a rebuttal rather than, "Government owns GPS!" That is the conspiracy cop-out right there.

       If you really cared about uncovering an objective truth, you would do your own homework and look at the data for yourself.

       I'm not even arguing against a Flat Earth, I'm simply encouraging you to recognize your own biases. Conspiracy Theorists should hold an attitude of the utmost skepticism, but what you've demonstrated is anything but that; it's an almost fervent hope that the world actually is flat.

       Questions should always remain open ended for a conspiracy theorist. IMO flat earth hasn't been concretely disproven, and the more you look into history of science, nasa,  the Cia, etc the more you'll see has been hidden from us. At the end of the day, I can go out on the beach, see another beach 15- 20 miles away(defies the formula for curvature, it should be well below the horizon). That's my personal proof. I can see how there is stretchs of land that defy the curvature and let you see further then you should be able to, but oceans should follow the curvature and they don't from my person observations. You can find many youtube videos of people zooming in on distant coasts which should be even further below the horizon.

       They don't.   It's not really an organic 'conspiracy theory' but rather something that certain folks specifically picked to start spamming CT type forums/subs with because it's a very well known 'stupid' idea from hundreds of years ago.  The idea will be to dillute all the good useful information here with shit in order to maybe put people off fom hanging around and learning something but also to create the impression that the users of the sub are people who believe any old shit.   It's scientifically provable that the Earth is round  (you can do this yourself) and on that basis alone posts claiming that the World is flat should be removed by the mods immediately in my opinion due to the ratio of benefit and damage of having them here.

       Yes they do, look at a flat earth flight maps. 2 stop flights which shoot wildly off course north to make absurd connections actually make sense on a flat earth map, where the top of the triangle shape on a globe is actually the middle point of a straight line between the origin and the destination on a flat map. The emergency landing in Alaska from Bali to LA makes sense only if Alaska is on the way to LA from Bali, which it is, on the flat earth map, but not the globe. There are no real flights that you'd be able to take over Antarctica.

       It's the middle Knightsbridge so there's not too many airstrips nearby other than the actual airports.  I used to live in London and we walk past all manner of kerfuffles every day.  You don't even look round at an emergency vehicle most of the time as it just doesn't concern you and it's one of a good few you'll probably see that day.  There wouldn't be any shit going down anyway.  In fact, had he had his lunch spiked for example, he may have just been a lump of meat to be moved.

       So, just to clarify (since this is kind of an imprecise answer), you mean that when you take a straight-line measurement (using a laser?) you have to correct that measurement for the curve of the Earth in order to get it to match up with what the GPS satellites tell you?
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean, obviously you're not saying that the 'GPS coordinates' are wrong.

       It's largely the same claim over and over again with minor changes. Best example to disprove would be the Statue of Liberty one because there are like four dozen of that claim over and over again.
      </p>
      <p>
       First problem: there's no proofs given, it's just empty claims. All he's doing is claiming that you can see the Statue of Liberty, he doesn't give you a reason to believe him at all. Not even a measly picture.
      </p>
      <p>
       Second problem: he doesn't give you any information to recreate his "experiment" (not to imply that I think he's ever done this experiment). Where was he when he supposedly saw the Statue? "60 miles away" is a circle with a circumference of nearly 400 miles in three states - no one could follow up if they wanted to because of this.
      </p>
      <p>
       Third problem: this claim isn't true. I'm about 60 miles away from the Statue of Liberty and I can't see it right now. Of course, flat earthers will claim that my vision is being blocked by trees and hills and buildings - and I would agree! Therefore, the location the author must have been in to truthfully make this claim has to be somewhere on
       <a href="http://i.imgur.com/Tf1qlyD.png">
        this circle
       </a>
       that is not being blocked by hills, trees, buildings, etc. It should be really obvious that this isn't possible because New York Harbor is surrounded by buildings, trees, and hills.

       But if everything was on a single plane, that wouldn't matter. The line passing through your eye and the edge of the ruler would meet the horizon no matter what point on the ruler you were looking through.
      </p>
      <p>
       The test at the start proves the ruler is straight. Your eye is a fixed point. The only thing that can be different is the horizon.

       I actually just made
       <a href="https://ggbm.at/GggKT2CG">
        this
       </a>
       to demonstrate what I was trying to say. The scale is really fucked (x:y is 2000:1) so this great circle of the earth looks more like a parabola but it's the only way to get all the points in one view (the units are in feet so we're looking at a 21 million foot radius circle here so hopefully that's not too upsetting). The flat red line is the standard flat earther perspective whereas the point G and the intersecting horizon line represents someone only one foot above sea level and the value is the distance in feet from the observer (So a little over a mile is now the horizon line only one foot off the ground which means you can see things that are over a foot tall from this perspective from 2 miles away). The lowest point J is the point of horizon for someone 15 feet above sea level and is about 5 miles away (15 feet above sea level gives you a 10 mile line of sight for things just over 15 feet tall). Now hopefully you see in any other demo like this they forget your line of sight can drop below a perfect horizontal gaze at 0 feet above sea level (probably because they believe in the fictitious "law of perspective"). Hopefully that satisfies your debunking need because I ain't makin' no YouTube video.

       But when the piece is connected it locks in perfectly and not at an angle. Let's say there aren't many pieces, but one long 24,901 mile piece of straight track that comes out of theoretical "track-maker" that is perfectly level at the source (like a laser beam coming out that is perfectly level--I'm using steel instead of a laser, because I imagine the atmosphere can affect a laser beam). Would the seemingly inflexible steel rail end up in space, or bend around the earth making a complete circle?

       That's unfair....you forget about raw distance( there is a big difference from 60 miles and 1000 miles, let alone 10,000 + miles)...atmospheric conditions...relative angles....elevation....and again, the earth is not perfectly "flat"... Mountains and valleys etc etc.

       In this experiment, were the earth flat, then the canal would be flat, and could be measured as such, by putting a laser on a boat and measuring its height on a wall on the other end, then moving the boat closer to the wall, and looking for any height change.

       It doesn't account for those things. Flat earthers just ignore, deny, and misinterpret all legitimate evidence. They rely on people on the internet who have layman's understandings of physics and astronomy to fuel their beliefs.

       Like the position of Polaris, as you said, and long-exposure photographs of stars. Compare images from the northern hemisphere, southern hemisphere, and equator. At the equator, long exposure images will show the stars taking a straight path across the sky.  Further north/south, the stars appear to take a curved path.

       That apparent movement makes perfect sense in a round earth model. There's 0 explanation for those on a flat Earth model. That's one of the easiest proofs against a flat Earth. Others include Earth's shadow on the moon, measurements of gravity, a Foucalt pendulum... I could go on. I just think flat earthers fall into a a category of people who are just dangerously stupid, because they are able to believe nonsense in the face of all contradicting evidence. It shows they are unwilling to accept facts once they find an opinion that they like best. There's a reason most flat earthers believe the exact same set of conspiracies.
