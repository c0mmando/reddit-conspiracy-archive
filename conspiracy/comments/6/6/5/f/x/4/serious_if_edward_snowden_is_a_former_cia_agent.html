    <div class="md"><p>Add to that, The Intercept (which technically &#39;owns&#39; the cache of information Snowden gave to Glenn Greenwald) has only released 5-10% of that cache and seems to have no plans to release any more of it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Intercept, while having absolutely fantastic reporting, is fairly fishy. First, it&#39;s basically a billionaire&#39;s personal magazine. Secondly, an awful lot of their intelligence stories sound more like PR for said programs than anything critical. The recent ones on Palantir come to mind as very technical marketing. Which makes sense since I think a TON of people in tech read the site, and it&#39;s probably mandatory reading for anyone in corporate security. So you get this odd situation where, on the one hand they&#39;re exposing these technical programs (or selected &quot;leaked&quot; parts of them), while on the other hand it&#39;s likely benefiting the private capital behind said programs. We get informed, sort of, and a service is provided.</p>

<p>Also Scahill, on his podcast (also worth listening to despite these issues) sounds more like he forgot the &quot;ca&quot; in his name and comes off sometimes as pro-CIA, which makes no sense given his past reporting, but there it is.</p>

I don&#39;t know why I should even have to say it, but just because he works for the CIA doesn&#39;t mean he is a baby killing Satanist that plots the death of America.  Most of these people are upstanding, honest citizens trying to do their job.  The fact that he redpilled so many people that normally would never have believed any of it before is certainly not in the interests of the power that be, even if you take it as a cruel trick to remind everybody that they&#39;re being watched.  TPTB are all about subtlety and misdirection and indirect truth, and Snowden was anything but.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wouldn&#39;t call &quot;most&quot; CIA agents &quot;upstanding, honest citizens.&quot; They work for an organization that at the heart, is engaged in espionage and carrying out geopolitical destabilization.

<p>If he redpilled so many people, why has government intrusion only gotten worse? Nothing good has come out of it. I think you&#39;re right when you say it could be a cruel trick to remind people they&#39;re being watched. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Technically it&#39;s been going on since at least the 80s with REX84, but few people had direct evidence or it was summarily buried/tinfoiled.  Alex Jones talked about it quite a bit before Snowden, as did others, but Snowden revealed the scope and specifics of how they do it and who does it.  We really have nothing on his motivations and goals other than his word and our own speculation, but I like to think he&#39;s a LH for the &#39;white hats&#39; in government who leaked the info to expose the Deep State and create public awareness.

    <div class="md"><p>Didn&#39;t realize how anti-Snowden this sub was, until your post. I think he did a great service, mainly by releasing and giving names to what most of us suspected. Many in this sub will never trust any popular figure as they believe they have all been compromised in some way. Weather it&#39;s Assuage, Snowed or anyone else. When it comes to Alex Jones, I definitely question his background and consider him an intro to the conspiracy world. Though I do think his lawyer calling him a performance artist, is a lawyer thing to do. Same as his apology to the pizza guy, nobody wants to get sued, especially since the Government is not investigating pizzagate, but the sleuths here or reddit and voat have definitely found probable cause. Most conspiracies can&#39;t be proven without the help of Government releases, and all our 3-letter agencies are propaganda machines to protect their own interests. I think Snowden is a really intelligent whistleblower and planned for his releases and for his safety better then other whistleblowers. He successfully made it out of this Country alive and has the freedom and name recognition to be interviewed. Considering that most people would end up suicided, people questions his legitimacy. I believe he&#39;s a hero, but I&#39;m always open to hearing a different take with some decent evidence.         </p>
