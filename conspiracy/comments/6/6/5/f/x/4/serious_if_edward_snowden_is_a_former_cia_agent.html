       -Where are all the Booz docs? 
-How many government officials have been forced to resign? 
-Why wouldn't the government want his narrative of 'be careful, you're being watched' out for the public to consume?
-Why does Greenwald go to the Academy Awards, while hardly anybody even knows who Duncan Campbell is?

       He absolutely could have released gigs of data on Booz. There are a lot of private/secret docs that could bring down a lot of people that surely he had access to. The other two are just part of the government narrative he plays a role in.

       I don't buy it. They should have published all the docs. It's too shady when a former CIA agent and his Hollywood media pals pick a few things to release that we basically already knew.

       Add to that, The Intercept (which technically 'owns' the cache of information Snowden gave to Glenn Greenwald) has only released 5-10% of that cache and seems to have no plans to release any more of it.

       The Intercept, while having absolutely fantastic reporting, is fairly fishy. First, it's basically a billionaire's personal magazine. Secondly, an awful lot of their intelligence stories sound more like PR for said programs than anything critical. The recent ones on Palantir come to mind as very technical marketing. Which makes sense since I think a TON of people in tech read the site, and it's probably mandatory reading for anyone in corporate security. So you get this odd situation where, on the one hand they're exposing these technical programs (or selected "leaked" parts of them), while on the other hand it's likely benefiting the private capital behind said programs. We get informed, sort of, and a service is provided.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also Scahill, on his podcast (also worth listening to despite these issues) sounds more like he forgot the "ca" in his name and comes off sometimes as pro-CIA, which makes no sense given his past reporting, but there it is.

       We respond strongly to verifiable information relevant to our interests. We're very interested in the topics that WikiLeaks has raised but there's not much of that coming from anyone but WikiLeaks. The way to beat WikiLeaks is to supply more verifiable information relevant to our interests than they do. That's how the news business is supposed to work.

       A good post will have a short narrative or synopsis of what it's saying, why you think that, and the evidence that backs it up. There's more than a few good posts up now that follow this format.
      </p>
      <p>
       In this case it would be: Perhaps we shouldn't trust Snowden because, x (source), y (source), z(source). That would make this post more informative and foster a more intelligent debate about Snowden and how the conspiracy community should view him.

       He strikes me as being fairly legit, or at least working for the good guys / white hats to expose government corruption.  I don't know why I should even have to say it, but just because he works for the CIA doesn't mean he is a baby killing Satanist that plots the death of America.  Most of these people are upstanding, honest citizens trying to do their job.  The fact that he redpilled so many people that normally would never have believed any of it before is certainly not in the interests of the power that be, even if you take it as a cruel trick to remind everybody that they're being watched.  TPTB are all about subtlety and misdirection and indirect truth, and Snowden was anything but.

       I wouldn't call "most" CIA agents "upstanding, honest citizens." They work for an organization that at the heart, is engaged in espionage and carrying out geopolitical destabilization. EVERY person going in knows this. They're certainly not stupid.
      </p>
      <p>
       If he redpilled so many people, why has government intrusion only gotten worse? Nothing good has come out of it. I think you're right when you say it could be a cruel trick to remind people they're being watched.

       That is a hell of an assumption to make.  EVERY person knows
       <em>
        that
       </em>
       about the CIA?  I'm pretty sure that's completely false.  I'm pretty sure the only people that know and believe that stuff are mostly people like me and you who are into conspiracy, and the majority of typical Americans probably think they are out fighting terrorists and making the world safe for Uncle Sam.  Government agencies also frequently attract patriotic do-gooders who like to think they're going to make a difference "working from the inside" too, and many of those people became whistleblowers.

       You didn't know the government was spying on us? I mean, ECHELON was known publicly for years. I'm pretty sure everyone (esp on this thread) already knew everything because it was covered fairly extensively going back to the 1980s.

       I didn't have absolute proof of it that I could link to. It also sets the latest date at which we had a semblance of a free press. Contrast the wall to wall coverage the Free Press gave Snowden to the Establishment Propaganda Organ's desperate attempt to stifle the WikiLeaks. In any case, the reason we trust Snowden, Assange and Manning is that they all told us truths we needed to hear. We don't trust WaPo, BBC and NPR and the rest of the EPO is that we can see the truth and hear their lies at the same time.

       Reddit is a hivemind. We value accurate information and honest voices. We despise bad information and astroturf. The leakers are heroes to the hivemind because they have made deep personal sacrifices to bring us accurate information. The establishment propaganda organism is a hostile force because it is trying to hide things from us and distract us. It really is that simple.

       I'm surprised this thread is so negative on Snowden.   I  think it is health to be suspicious then verify any one from the inside.
      </p>
      <p>
       Before Snowden, sure we suspected the government was monitoring of communications but until his disclosure, we had no clue how invasive they were.  Snowden's disclosure provided no benefit to intelligence community at all.

       We knew in the 1980s the government was listening to billions of calls. We proceeded to find out much more over the following decades. This blows my mind how old it is:

       You mean when people could have actually stopped it before the wheels were really in motion and out of control?

       You're exactly right. Now that there is no turning back, the government wants people to know they're watching us, but it's obviously too Orwellian to just come out and say it. Enter: Ed Snowden

       There is some logic in that approach, my only point is I think Snowden exposed them before they were ready for disclosure.  In the end it didn't matter because Americans are going to either ignore or not comprehend how their country has been taken from them.

       Technically it's been going on since at least the 80s with REX84, but few people had direct evidence or it was summarily buried/tinfoiled.  Alex Jones talked about it quite a bit before Snowden, as did others, but Snowden revealed the scope and specifics of how they do it and who does it.  We really have nothing on his motivations and goals other than his word and our own speculation, but I like to think he's a LH for the 'white hats' in government who leaked the info to expose the Deep State and create public awareness.  Like you said, there was no benefit to the IC or the Deep State to have this go public.

       Because he's the

       There may absolutely be something to this. I believe he himself has said, during interviews, things like the NSA is very "millennial" or in some ways "cool tech nerds". He certainly still defends the rank and file NSA employees and just blames certain excesses on "leadership", as though everything would be fine if we could get the right people in charge....
      </p>

       If that isn't both incredibly good agency PR and recruitment for the "nerdy cool kids" who pay attention to this stuff, I don't know what is.

       Many of you prefer complication in the form of argument and debate. It makes you feel like you've participated in a way that earns you a trophy for thinking.

       Didn't realize how anti-Snowden this sub was, until your post. I think he did a great service, mainly by releasing and giving names to what most of us suspected. Many in this sub will never trust any popular figure as they believe they have all been compromised in some way. Weather it's Assuage, Snowed or anyone else. When it comes to Alex Jones, I definitely question his background and consider him an intro to the conspiracy world. Though I do think his lawyer calling him a performance artist, is a lawyer thing to do. Same as his apology to the pizza guy, nobody wants to get sued, especially since the Government is not investigating pizzagate, but the sleuths here or reddit and voat have definitely found probable cause. Most conspiracies can't be proven without the help of Government releases, and all our 3-letter agencies are propaganda machines to protect their own interests. I think Snowden is a really intelligent whistleblower and planned for his releases and for his safety better then other whistleblowers. He successfully made it out of this Country alive and has the freedom and name recognition to be interviewed. Considering that most people would end up suicided, people questions his legitimacy. I believe he's a hero, but I'm always open to hearing a different take with some decent evidence.

       Add to that, The Intercept (which technically 'owns' the cache of information Snowden gave to Glenn Greenwald) has only released 5-10% of that cache and seems to have no plans to release any more of it.
