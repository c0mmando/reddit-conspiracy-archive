       I work for God.  My chain of command is God - Me. I have been teaching people, mostly online, about God Almighty, how to see him, how to see The Spiritual, Faith, and how to grow in Faith.  In working for God, I discovered what I term Evil Farmers.  (Luke 20:9-19) Christian subs seem to have issues dealing with the reality of it.  I would like to share what I have been shown and deal with here to some degree.

       It is actually a lot to take in all at once.  The Truth hurts. Knowledge Brings Sorrow.  Ignorance is bliss.  I suppose I am testing the waters to see how hard I may go.

       Luke 20:9-19New International Version (NIV)
      </p>
      <p>
       The Parable of the Tenants
9 He went on to tell the people this parable: “A man planted a vineyard, rented it to some farmers and went away for a long time. 10 At harvest time he sent a servant to the tenants so they would give him some of the fruit of the vineyard. But the tenants beat him and sent him away empty-handed. 11 He sent another servant, but that one also they beat and treated shamefully and sent away empty-handed. 12 He sent still a third, and they wounded him and threw him out.
      </p>
      <p>
       13 “Then the owner of the vineyard said, ‘What shall I do? I will send my son, whom I love; perhaps they will respect him.’
      </p>
      <p>
       14 “But when the tenants saw him, they talked the matter over. ‘This is the heir,’ they said. ‘Let’s kill him, and the inheritance will be ours.’ 15 So they threw him out of the vineyard and killed him.
      </p>
      <p>
       “What then will the owner of the vineyard do to them? 16 He will come and kill those tenants and give the vineyard to others.”
      </p>
      <p>
       When the people heard this, they said, “God forbid!”
      </p>
      <p>
       17 Jesus looked directly at them and asked, “Then what is the meaning of that which is written:
      </p>
      <p>
       “‘The stone the builders rejected
    has become the cornerstone’[a]?
18 Everyone who falls on that stone will be broken to pieces; anyone on whom it falls will be crushed.”
      </p>
      <p>
       19 The teachers of the law and the chief priests looked for a way to arrest him immediately, because they knew he had spoken this parable against them. But they were afraid of the people.

       John Stewart was a Secular Jew.  He may not have even believed in God.  He would like to define Christianity and God for people.  God Almighty in The Bible is God you cannot control.  Pagans made false gods to control something.  There is cause and effect to the spiritual.  God does not change.  (Malachi 3:6,7)  Are the times a changing like the famous Bob Dylan song?  People would like to control God and change him with the times?  No.  God does not change.  God makes promises, and he keeps his promises.

       Recently another secular Jew started a Temple of Satan in Salem, MA.  His words: "For the 49-year-old Jarry, there is not much conflict between being Jewish and a Satanist. As a matter of fact, the two identities have come to inform each other, he said."

        When a Jew has a Gentile in his clutches, another Jew may go to the same Gentile, lend him money and in turn deceive him, so that the Gentile shall be ruined. For the property of a Gentile, according to our law, belongs to no one, and the first Jew that passes has full right to seize it.

       In Islam it is ok to lie to a Kafir or non-believer or non Muslim.

       God Almighty, God of the Bible does not lie.  There is power in words.  God spoke and something was created.  Some people have a lying tongue.  Christians do not need to lie to you.  They have The Truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        For you were once darkness, but now you are light in the Lord. Live as children of light
       </em>
       (Ephesians 5:8)
      </p>
      <p>
       Have you ever accepted a lie as truth?  You were in the dark.  It is like the Allegory of The Cave.  Man is lied to and accepts a lie.  He ends up in darkness like he is in a cave.  Man may grow complacent and comfortable down there, unaware of the danger.  Jesus Christ is the shining light leading people out of the cave into God's Kingdom.
      </p>
      <p>
       God does not lie.  Someone speaking for God could not lie.  It has to do with the character of a prophet and the character of God in the Bible.

       Satan is a liar and deceiver. Faith is evidence of things unseen.  There is cause and effect.  What do people attribute their cause and effect to?  Satan lies.  Given you accepted a lie, you may be a blind man.  Do you have ears to hear and eyes to see?

        Mysteries of The Bible  - The Maccabees: Revolution and Redemption
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       I grew up Non-Denominational.  I never learned about The Maccabees really till I watched the above video.  The Sadducees in the Bible were the wealthy or Jewish upper-classes mostly.  In the video, the wealthy Jews or Sadducees, were tended towards Hellenization.  They appeared to be interested with being accepted by the Greek Elite, Power, and Money rather than God.  Did they sell out their countrymen?

       It is an important concept for understanding God, history, and The Bible.

       Isn't the Trinity rooted in pagan religions? Did Emperor Constantine make Christians worship a Trinity? Another question I have, does a Christian's salvation require him (or her) to believe in the Trinity? What if an individual believes Jesus is the Son, and that faith in Jesus brings salvation, but does not believe that Jesus is "God Almighty". Is that person still "saved"?

I am not from a Native American tribe, nor do I know any of my ancestors were, but I was born in the US.  My dad was born in the US.  His dad was born in the US and so on.  I can rightfully say I am a Native American.  I am native to the land.  There was also a political party in the 1950's known as "The Native Americans" or "Know Nothings."  They were against immigration.  What happened?  Jesse Jackson changed the meaning of the term, and academia accepted it in the 1980s.  It became politically correct.

       Someone venturing into the Spiritual may start to see that certain words and symbols have meanings associated to them, and God may have some Spiritual Law or defintion for them.  They may also see people like Jesse Jackson "Wordsmithing," and changing people's perceptions towards some purpose not of The Kingdom of God.  Should people listen to Jesse Jackson who promoted Hyphenated Americanism or Teddy Roosevelt who spoke against it?

       Why do you quote the Hebrew Bible when it was written by Jews, for Jews?
      </p>

       That would be like non-Muslims starting some non-Muslim religion, and yet worship Allah and continually quote the Koran.

       Are you jealous?  That seems to be a major theme in the Talmud?

       Does someone have 7 Spirits of God or 7 Jewish Souls?  There is a big difference.

       Prophet Isaiah says it is 7 Spirits of God.  In Revelations 1:4 we have 7 Spirits.  That is consistent.  In the Talmud it changes.

       A Soul is intrinsic to someone.  A Spirit comes from God.  The Talmud would seem to be "Racist" and Jews jealous? Jews have reason to lie to the gentile?
      </p>
      <p>
       What exactly constitutes being a Jew in 2017?  I grew up in a Non-Denominational Church  Protestant Church sing "Father Abraham had many sons, I am one of them."  Am I not a Jew through The Spirit of God with a circumcision of The Heart?

       Jesus, our Messiah, was Jewish, they were His scriptures as He walked the earth, and His life fulfilled many prophecies in the Hebrew Bible. The New Testament is a continuation of the Hebrew scriptures following Christ's life and contains prophecies yet to be fulfilled, some of which were first mentioned in the Hebrew books of Ezekiel and Daniel. It is one work by One Author. The Hebrew Scriptures are inherently Christian.

       I mentioned "Worldsmithing."  For more evidence on that, I would point you to this interview with a Former Satanic Priest.

      <p>
       I would also point out, that Kabbalah is used used by many Occult Groups.  The Golden Dawn and Aleister Crowley come to mind.    Madonna is into Kabbalah.  We end up with songs like "Like a Prayer" which is sexualization of something of God in a wicked way.
      </p>
      <p>
       When you learn to know what to look for it is not hard to see Lucifer and how he works.  I would highly recommend being right with God and having a relationship with him before digging too deep into it.

       Someone could give you theological answer to that.  I am about cause and effect.  You find cause and effect with the Spiritual you may have a Fear of God.  Fear of God is a Good thing.  It takes away your Fear of Man.  God's Love is Fatherly.  Perfect love knows no Fear.  You are doing the right things?  What is there to Fear?

       The Trinity is a complex subject.  One way that I have been describing it is that The Father is everything.  He rules kind of like Pharaoh, and Jesus Christ is "Hand of The King" like in Game of Thrones.  He rules or wields power and authority like Joseph with Pharaoh.

Jesus Reveals the Father
7 If you know Me, you will also know My Father. From now on you do know Him and have seen Him.

       8 Lord, said Philip, show us the Father, and thats enough for us.

       9 Jesus said to him, Have I been among you all this time without your knowing Me, Philip? 
The one who has seen Me has seen the Father. 
How can you say, Show us the Father? 
10 Dont you believe that I am in the Father and the Father is in Me? 
The words I speak to you I do not speak on My own. The Father who lives in Me does His works. 
11 Believe Me that I am in the Father 
and the Father is in Me. 
Otherwise, believe because of the works themselves.

       Hebrews 4:12-13
For the word of God is living and effective and sharper than any double- edged sword, penetrating as far as the separation of soul and spirit, joints and marrow. It is able to judge the ideas and thoughts of the heart. 
13 No creature is hidden from Him, but all things are naked and exposed to the eyes of Him to whom we must give an account.
      </p>
      <p>
       2 Timothy 3:15-17
and you know that from childhood you have known the sacred Scriptures, which are able to give you wisdom for salvation through faith in Christ Jesus. 
16 All Scripture is inspired by God and is profitable for teaching, for rebuking, for correcting, for training in righteousness, 
17 so that the man of God may be complete, equipped for every good work.

       It is easy to attribute bad things to The Devil.  In James it tells us to lean to joyfully endure our trials. (James 1:2-4)  Trials help a man develop character.  It tests his measure and helps him grow in Faith in the right context.  Lucifer was known as an Angel of Light and some people worship him.  It isn't too hard to find them over the internet or Facebook.  A man who learns to see Spiritual and has cause and effect with it, like a Prophet, may be able to see exactly what they are doing.

       Lucifer is a creation of fiction. End of story.  You wouldn't have even heard of 'him' or even been aware of the concept if other people had not passed it onto you like the meme that it is.  A cultural artifact. Like a poem or a mythical hero. Sounds from the hole in our head with some associate semantic data. Not a real thing.

       Jesus Christ is The Man.  (1 Timothy 2:5)  The Man like "The Man" Aloe Blacc which is a story about The Kingdom of God?  The Man like "When The Man Comes Around" Johnny Cash.   The Man like Hulk Hogan who went NWO and would like to say
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_itzww0XTo">
        "I'm The Man Brother!!!?"
       </a>
       Hulk Hogan says he has Eyes to See and Ears to Hear which is a major theme in the Bible among Prophets.  Do you have eyes to see and ears to hear?

       When I first heard the song "No Good" by Kaleo, I soon posted it on my Facebook as something for God.  I was going for more of a "When The Man Comes Around."  I later discovered an HBO series called "Lucifer" and that was the theme song.

       Satan's Kingdom was like an Unholy Roman Empire.  It was a variety of interests that may not like each other and fight, but they are unified with a "Do as Thou Wilt."  Do as Thou Wilt coming from Crowley.

       At your local University, you may find a Humanist Action league Club.   Secular Humanism is Luciferian.  They believe that they are enlightened and have a better way than God.  They created their own righteousness.  When I went to college, The Humanist Action League or HAL, was very active.  They had debates, and went to lots of events.  The Young Democrats were basically a No Show, and the Humanist Action League was pulling their weight or doing was the Young Democrats should have been doing.  This particular group, in 2006, was a group of Atheists, Agnostics, and Wiccans lead by an Episcopalian Pastor.  Their primary goal was the promotion of Non-Traditional Religion which breaks down to mean "Anything but Traditional Christianity."  Sharia Islam?  As long as it is not Traditional Christianity.  Why are there migration problems in The West?  It has something to do with Luciferian Secular Humanism.

       God is a square.  It is like the song

        "Hip to be Square"

       from Huey Lewis and the News.  God works in particular ways.  You read your Bible, you may learn to see God's Character, and how he works in the world growing in Faith.
      </p>

       God is a Judge.  A Judge is Your Honor or The Honorable.  Is a Secular Judge really honorable or is it just a title?

       In the Army, the saying is "Square yourself away" as in fix yourself and follow the standards or "You are out of line."   A military man may be a square.  God is a square.  Cleanliness is next to Godliness.

      <p>
       There is cause and effect to the Spiritual.  Serving God, someone may find and experience cause and effect growing in Faith.
      </p>
      <p>
       Satanists may have cause and effect.  They also work in particular ways.  God was made at specific things in regards to Israel and Judah, like some Temple Prostitution (Eyes Wide Shut or Killing Kittens, and Moloch worship (Human Sacrifice.)  Aleister Crowley, given you care to read about him, was a Satanist and really motivated to mock God and Christianity.  How far do you think he would be willing to go?
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't really like writing about "Eyes Wide Shut."  It is a rough subject, and leaves me in a bad place.  I can show you how to see it and clues, and explain to you what they do on a spiritual level.  Removing it may take an "Act of God."
