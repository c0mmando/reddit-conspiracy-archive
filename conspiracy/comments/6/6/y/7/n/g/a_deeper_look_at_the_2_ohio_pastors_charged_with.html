       I first started digging through this after someone here posted about the suspicious connections with the Cleveland Killer. In his post, he presented a link between this incident and the Ohio Pastors that were charged with child trafficking and abuse. This prompted me to start doing my own digging and I found some EXTREMELY suspicious links.
      </p>
      <p>
       First off, I'll be focusing on Pastor Cordell Jenkins.
       <a href="http://www.13abc.com/content/news/Pastor-Cordell-Jenkins-appears-in-federal-court--419431564.html">
        Here is a brief overview of the incident for those that don't know.
       </a>
       His wife is Laura Lloyd Jenkins, an administrator of Lucas County who was considered for Lucas County Commissioner in 2012. Here's some info on the
       <a href="http://lchtc.org/">
        Human Trafficking Coalition.
       </a>
       Laura-Lloyd Jenkins
       <a href="http://www.vibe.com/2017/04/fbi-arrests-ohio-pastor-sex-trafficking/">
        is a secretary on the board of trustees for Lucas County Children Services.
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       So just to be clear:
       <strong>
        The husband of the Administrator of Lucas County, the secretary of the board for Children Services, is on trial for child trafficking.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       "Community Commissioner President Pete Gerken released a statement, confirming she isn’t connected to the case. “If this is true it is indefensible for Pastor Jenkins,” he said. “Our county employee remains a county employee… [She], to our knowledge, is not charged and complicit.” Whew! Glad that's all cleared up, thanks Pete! /s
      </p>
      <p>
       Might be relevant, but Jenkins was the founder of Abundant Life Ministries in Toledo, OH. I cannot find much information about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       But it goes even deeper than this. Cordell Jenkins hired an attorney named
       <a href="https://www.avvo.com/attorneys/48076-mi-allison-folmar-739483.html#resume">
        Allison Folmar,
       </a>
       who has been
       <a href="http://www.noethics.net/News/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=8516:-attorney-allison-folmar-of-southfield-mi-ethical-dwarf-&amp;catid=154:michigan-attorney-misfits&amp;Itemid=100">
        disciplined and reprimanded 2 separate times.
       </a>
       Her practice area? 100% centered around child custody.
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cz7CJ1bYioM">
        Here's a video showing what she's accomplished, chock full of emotional appeal.
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       This begs to question:
       <strong>
        Why is an attorney, so avidly against child kidnapping, defending Cordell Jenkins, who has been charged with child trafficking?
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       The founder of Standing Together Against Real Slavery (STARS) is named EloSondra DeRomano and has been speaking out against this. She is a supposed victim of child prostitution. I find it very suspicious given this quote:
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        "Their investigation lead to an operation that allegedly involved Haynes and another woman recruiting, enticing and harboring those under 18 in sex acts. The acts go back three years, with Haynes, along with a woman introducing the teen to other adults to pay for sex—one of them including Jenkins."
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       Who is this other woman and why is her name omitted from any of these stories? Why is there no investigation into her? I'm not saying DeRomano or Lloyd-Jenkins is this unknown woman, I'm merely suggesting leads for others to go off of.
      </p>
      <p>
       There have been 2 domains under the name of this organization (STARS) and both of them aren't up anymore. One of them is
       <a href="http://www.starss.us/">
        http://www.starss.us/
       </a>
       and another is
       <a href="http://www.starstoledo.com/">
        http://www.starstoledo.com/
       </a>
       I have no idea how to find out when a site was taken down, maybe that would be another lead?
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm posting this not as proof, but to get the gears turning. We as a community have extreme potential to uncover a deeper truth going on here. I may just be deep in the rabbit-hole here, but my intuition is telling me that there is something much more sinister going on. I could really use a hand in continuing to investigate these and connect more dots. There's also another site called
       <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=2&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjt79Pp9LjTAhVX12MKHV9-DogQFggoMAE&amp;url=%2Finterstitial%3Furl%3Dhttp%3A%2F%2Fthegreenlightproject.net%2Ftoledo%2F&amp;usg=AFQjCNFVjGN--hLBR1f1fS665FVUa9-wjw&amp;sig2=Sg2sRapHnHBwGj7kEk5DpQ">
        The Greenlight Project
       </a>
       , which my computer says is very dangerous to visit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Toledo, OH is notorious for being a hub for human trafficking ever since a sting in Pennsylvania around 10 years ago. This goes deeper than it appears on the surface, I can feel it.
