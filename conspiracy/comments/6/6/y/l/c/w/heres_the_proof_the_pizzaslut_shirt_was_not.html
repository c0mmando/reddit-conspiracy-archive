<p>so, that discussion had the mods crying foul because the image was supposedly photoshopped.... except there was no need to photoshop something that has been a thing for a while now.. <a href="http://archive.is/p6iKm">http://archive.is/p6iKm</a></p>

<p>we should be asking ourselves why the original post was shot down so hard and fast... because it couldn&#39;t be that the mods have an agenda to steer us away from decent information.............. could it?</p>

<p>I will try to find it. It sometimes get linked in AskReddit when somebody asks about the worst sub you&#39;ve ever seen, which happens every 2 months or so. I think Incels has a bit if this stuff, too.</p>

I understand the need for awareness of the rampant sexual abuse that pervades our society, but not at the expense of a child&#39;s privacy. Remember the same photos you share to spread awareness can also be material for people who don&#39;t have such good intentions. This isn&#39;t appropriate.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s funny, (and I&#39;m not trying to take away from or slander anyone) but flat earth theories, hollow earth theories, aliens, and soul market theories rarely get taken down, despite half of these theories having little to no proof. But a picture related to a investigation into a pedo ring is taken down. The more I think about, the more it starts to sound fishy and odd that a mod would even take it down. Pedogate is a conspiracy and the pizzaslut picture was just another piece of the puzzle. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wonder about this, as well. We have people posting about flat-earth and anti-vaxx theories, and there are very few posts disagreeing with them.</p>

<p>But when people post about Pedogate, they get hundreds of responses saying that people are delusional for believing it, the picture was photoshopped, it&#39;s all just a coincidence, etc. All of these posts with a lot of upvotes, too. It&#39;s not uncommon for Pedogate posts to be deleted completely. I&#39;m not big on conspiracy theories, I literally only follow this sub for Pedogate news. But I am really starting to think paid shills are a thing and this sub is full of them.</p>

<p>It&#39;s too bad that this is not taken seriously at all. I think calling it Pizzagate is hurting us. It makes people think of tinfoil hats and 4chan. What we should be emphasizing is powerful people trafficking children, something which a lot of people are more likely to be receptive to.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>pizza is ok isn&#39;t it... i mean.. pizza is the code word.. mobsters and their pizzarias.. just sayin&#39;... pizzagate, in the end, is what will need to be vindicated as Real News... no one is calling Pedogate &quot;fake news&quot; because it&#39;s such a broad spread net.. </p>

<p>i&#39;m not against the term pedogate at all.. but i never use it without also including pizzagate, because pizzagate is what the giants of this evil child-sex abuse trafficking ring are associated with.. hills, jimmy, &#39;desta..    so when this is broken open those three aren&#39;t overlooked..</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been searching this for a while. It&#39;s pretty obvious but bc of deregulation, nothing can be done. If they go to court, they only pay a fraction, if the state takes away these properties, the new crowd that replaces them will do the same. </p>

<p>It&#39;s a multinational conspiracy. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve also dug up applied sciences, imi Rafael and Israelis military industry hand how they launder money to keep Hamas in power thus keeping the far right regime in Israel in power. America does the same thing with ISIS and others. They rotate as head of the military then the industry then the country and back around again. If you find a smoking gun, you&#39;ll die before anything is done. </p>

<p>The only escape is to get land in an out of the way place like South America or Africa and live in a small community with other intelligent people with a mix of doctors engineers artist and natural science minds. Then you ignore it and save up and get ready for the state to attack you.</p>

<p>I&#39;m fairly certain &quot;Caris James&quot; was born ~2013. The girl in the t-shirt couldn&#39;t have been her. It took me like 5 minutes of research to learn this. You don&#39;t think it&#39;s a good idea to verify your facts before posting this shit?</p>

<p>The girl who uploaded the picture could have just been the kid&#39;s older sister making a fucking stupid joke. It could be anything. It&#39;s certainly not evidence of a crime, that&#39;s for sure. I&#39;m beginning to think you people are <em>trying</em> to get this sub banned. You have another post linking to the girl&#39;s personal facebook account. Why do you have to constantly test the limits of reddit&#39;s <a href="https://reddit.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/205183175-Is-posting-someone-s-private-or-personal-information-okay-">no doxing rule?</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>yes, she does look like she&#39;s exhibiting physical symptoms of stress... a user on voat mentioned a disorder which causes that, tho it is most commonly caused by cortisol being released... which we know is what happens as a reaction to physical and/ or psychological stress (cortisol may cause the disorder also, i&#39;m not sure).. her entire face looks a bit swollen to me, which would also enhance the look of swelling under her eyes..  i hope she has that disorder, if anything, but all things considered, i&#39;d be less surprised to learn she&#39;s showing classic physical symptoms of ongoing stress.  the most striking thing about the pics is how similar the facial proportion is from one to the other; it&#39;s uncanny.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because people are trying real hard to pin those people, but come up short each and every time. My problem lies more in how this &quot;investigation&quot; is handled, and the lack of standards throughout. It&#39;s especially problematic due to the subject itself.

<p>As I see it, if you can convince this sub, you may stand a chance to convince people elsewhere. If anything, constructive skepticism should be welcomed, as it either strengthens your case, or saves you time by disregarding things of non-value.</p>

<p>Above all, the burden is upon the proponents to prove this stuff--not the other way around.</p>

I also believe a great number of people are latching onto it here because of the empathy/kid factor as a means to bring someone of power down.

<p>Certainly, and you should actually receive more of it. The charges laid are damn serious. Call someone a pedo.rapist, that has staying power. No washing that off. So, in that regard, you folks better have something--hence what you would call &quot;attacks&quot;. In reality, these are just people who find all of your evidence flimsy, without substance, and question the intentions of it generally.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>That is problematic due to the above. You don&#39;t have much of anything, yet people are blidly following along to tickle their sense of bucking authority and catching an elite in some &quot;gotcha&quot; moment. That&#39;s dangerous, and you should deploy a higher sense of standards.</p>

<p>Conveniently, you misunderstand. I challenge the integrity of all of it, remaining healthily skeptical--because that is sensible given the subject at hand. Otherwise, your use of &quot;shills&quot; tells me that you have not yet progressed into complete sensibility, because if you have..then those sorts of buzzwords wouldn&#39;t have employ in your vocabulary.</p>

<p>false jews ran the shadow government in rome, just like they do here, now.</p>

<p>a &quot;real&quot; jew is considered the descendant of Shem.. one of noah&#39;s 3 sons... and technically, &quot;jew&quot; is really only appropriately used to denote someone genetically descended from the tribe of Judah... &quot;false&quot; jews, on the other hand, are primarily the descendants of specifically, the tribe of Dan (which was cut off from the rest of Israel, for being evil)... Jesus himself addresses these false evil jews in John ch. 8 esp. vs. 44, and indeed, these false jews are the ones who demanded our Lord and saviour be unjustly crucified.. they&#39;re mentioned again in Revelation, twice.. 2:9 and 3:9</p>

<p>Behold, I will make them of the synagogue of Satan, which say they are Jews, and are not, but do lie; behold, I will make them to come and worship before thy feet, and to know that I have loved thee.</p>

<p>Microsoft&#39;s TwinsOrNot.net gives them a 100% match, but honestly I don&#39;t know what their ROCs look like (a general measure of true positive to false positives), and this is more a for fun tool than a serious biometric recognition software. I actually worked with facial recognition in my undergrad, but most of the classifiers I wrote or used were trained on mostly adult faces, and I think they&#39;d be biased towards false positives when comparing children&#39;s faces.</p>

<p>To me, the faces look similar enough that it should not be discounted that they&#39;re the same child. The difference in time (the tshirt one is from at least 2012, while the tape one is only attributed to 2016) does throw a bit of a wrinkle in that attribution. </p>

<p>Betaface.com gives them a 52% match, which seems low to me, but I think the best we can say at this point is inconclusive. The point matching on the tape image by betaface looks pretty crude to me. I think they got it pretty wrong compared to if I was hand-matching points. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree for the most part. If you saw my other comment to IDA which I meant to reply to you, TwinsOrNot gave it a 100% match, which to me sounds a bit high, honestly.  </p>

<p>Without getting into too much of the math, most academic and commercial facial recognition software works by training a classifier on a set of training data, using a feature set that&#39;s either chosen manually or by some genetic algorithm or machine learning. Any given classifier has an ROC associated with it that which essentially plots the tradeoff between false positives and false negatives. </p>

<p>No facial recognition software has a 0% false positive and 100% true positive rate across the full problem space. Where you set the cutoff generally depends on your purposes. For example, if you&#39;re using facial recognition for access control to a secure facility, you&#39;ll generally set the false positive threshold very low: you want to be sure the person trying to gain access is the person who has credentials. If it doesn&#39;t match, you give extra scrutiny. If you&#39;re scanning an airport for known bad actors, you&#39;ll set the false positive threshold a bit higher; it&#39;s more important that you catch the persons you&#39;re looking for, even if this means giving extra scrutiny to some people who are completely innocent. </p>

<p>So when you say you want something more forensic, I&#39;d agree with you, but it&#39;s not so cut and dry. If this were an actual court case where a positive identification was of significant importance, you&#39;d most likely have expert witnesses from both sides present their evidence on why they think it is or is not the same person. Each side would likely use one or more software classifiers to support their conclusion, and each would likely make compelling arguments (especially if taken alone, that is without the opposing argument). </p>

<p>As a rule though, if someone gives you a single number answer (like the two I gave you, 100% and 52%), you should probably discount it. What you really need to know is the false positive rate associated with that number, and even then you&#39;re to some degree trusting that their classified was implemented, trained, and tested in a rigorous manner. </p>

<p>If I was being called as an expert witness (which I&#39;m absolutely not qualified for, though I am more familiar with this subject than most), I could provide you with decently compelling evidence for both sides. </p>

<p>Betaface is pretty well accepted as a leader in the field, providing services to many large corporations, but again, it depends on what the classifier is being used for. Like I said, it matched the points to faces pretty badly on one of the images, so the 52% match (again, a useless number on its own) is way too low. </p>

<p>If you&#39;re looking for something more conclusive, you&#39;re going to have to pay for it. It&#39;s pretty much that simple. You could try asking around some of the biometrics labs at universities to see if a research professor or grad student would help you pro bono, but having worked with them I can pretty much guarantee none of them are going to want their name and reputation anywhere near this. The other option is to find someone who provides expert testimony in court cases, but they&#39;re going to charge likely in the thousands of dollars, that is if they&#39;d even want to touch this. </p>

<p>Sorry I can&#39;t be more helpful than that. </p>

<p>it&#39;s funny, because &#39;see, dates are different&#39; is the same angle of pushback the skippy vids are getting.</p>

What is so controversial about that? 
Some people have horrible taste and make terrible decisions (like allowing a child to wear a shirt like that) but honestly, it&#39;s really no worse than parents allowing little girls to wear lipstick, false eye lashed and bikinis when entering beauty pageants.

Caris looks a LOT like Alefantis so....</p>

<p>There&#39;s a lot more going on than Caris wearing a Pizza Slut shirt. There are parents who dress their kids in &quot;Master&quot; and &quot;Slave&quot; shirts too. Who cares??? Get to the meat of the problem but the crumbs.</p>
