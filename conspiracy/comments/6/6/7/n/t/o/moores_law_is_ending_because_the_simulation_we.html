    <div class="md"><blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>No. GPUs are highly parallel. They were originally created for graphics applications, but there are plenty of other computations that can take advantage of that parallelism and run on GPUs (look up GPGPU). GPUs are <em>not</em> specialized in a meaningful sense.</p>

<p>Compare that with SIMD instructions on the CPU -- these are specialized and allow for parallel (but not concurrent) processing of vectors (e.g., an RGB triplet), where each element is processed at the same time. They only do this -- hence specialized.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The big data centers were mostly CPUs until recently, then they have all been switching to GPUs. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>No. GPGPU is becoming more widely used. They are not replacing CPUs.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The idea is they don&#39;t have the CPU power to continue the progress of Moore&#39;s law, but nearly infinite capability to emulate GPUs.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s nonsensical to assume that &quot;our simulators&quot; would be using something that resembles our CPUs or GPUs. Having said that, the same computer could be used to emulate (simulate) either a CPU or GPU, i.e., CPUs and GPUs are Turing equivalent.</p>

<p>But just for the sake of the argument:</p>

<p>The &quot;stuff&quot; happening inside a CPU or GPU is trivial compared to the complexity of the underlying physics. The idea that these beings could simulate a whole planet (solar system, universe) but could not simulate an x86 processor in any quantity is absurd.</p>

<p>Not trying to be rude but I don&#39;t think I can say the same. </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>There&#39;s nothing very clever about it. It&#39;s just a matter of parallelizing parts of a computation.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Turing equivalence means little, it is more about code complexity.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think you mean computational complexity, which is not the same as code complexity. (See below.)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The massive simulation of arbitrary things usually comes down to choices of genetic algorithms.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No it doesn&#39;t. &quot;Genetic algorithms&quot; has the word &quot;genetic&quot; in it but is not related to the simulation of natural systems. Genetic algorithms are a type of &quot;trial and error&quot; that are meant to allow an algorithm to adapt to a specific problem, much like evolution.</p>

<p>They sound cool but don&#39;t see widespread use as they&#39;re not that useful.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Your average greedy algorithm or simulated annealing will scale with CPU but not GPU (or GPGPU).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m not sure you know what either of those mean. You&#39;re talking about optimization problems which don&#39;t have a lot to do with simulations. Again, a CPU and GPU are Turing equivalent, so either could (theoretically, if not practically) run any algorithm. Any algorithm can benefit from the parallelization of a GPU if, well, it can be parallelized. You should look up &quot;optimization problems on GPUs&quot;.</p>

<p>Note that optimization here doesn&#39;t mean making a computer program run faster, that&#39;s a different kind of optimization.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Any insights on the nature of the simulators HW are much appreciated.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You want me to comment on a hypothetical super-race&#39;s computer hardware? Sure, they use XYLON architecture and run at 1 TWANTON ZARTS per QUADPOOP. Happy?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>it is more about code complexity.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There&#39;s sort of a point here, which I&#39;ll address:</p>

<p>It&#39;s true that any Turing equivalent machine can simulate/emulate any other, but with varying degrees of performance penalty. Sometimes that matters (emulating a quantum computer) and sometimes that doesn&#39;t (emulating a NES on a modern x86). A CPU could emulate a GPU but more slowly for a highly parallel problem. A classical computer can emulate a quantum computer, but again more slowly.</p>

<p>Still the idea that a super-race&#39;s computer could simulate a human body (from the subatomic scale up) <em>and</em> a silicon GPU but would somehow struggle with a CPU is firmly in the realm of nonsense, even for a purely hypothetical argument.</p>

<p>Again, not trying to be rude. You seem interested in computers and I encourage you to learn about them in earnest. It&#39;s a very rewarding area.</p>
