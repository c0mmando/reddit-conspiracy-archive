<p>Go look at all the other countries that replaced the democratically elected leader and see where they are now, overtaken by Isis, growing Opium for the Alphabets/Big Pharma, or selling slaves in Libya:</p>

<p>&quot;WMD&#39;s&quot; was a lie for M.I.C. just like chemical attacks in Syria are a false flag as well. Attacking Syria is a Globalist/Zionist Bankster hostile takeover because they are not debt slaves to the IMF/Central Banks.</p>

<p>Countries with Islam as their predominant culture require a hard lined leader to keep them all in check. You should do some research on how Gaddafi provided education, universal basic income, and various programs to his people, that place was for the most part doing really good under him, until he started talking about an African Union with its own Gold backed currency, then shit went down hill and deepstate killed him off</p>

Will Turkey be better off as a dictatorship?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Cuba a socialist paradise? lol ...you should hear some of the horror stories. I actually almost married a cuban girl a dated for a few years and her Dad used to talk about the &#39;camps&#39; and how gays would get beat in the streets, food rationing, limited resources, bribes, bureaucracy, empty grocery store shelves and many other details.....enough to have people risk shark invested waters to come to Florida  </p>

<blockquote>

<p>Temporarily, sure. It allowed them to be secularized, get Nukes, and get taken seriously on the world stage...unfortunately all it takes is one psycho like Erdogan to start reversing all of that and entering into some fascist radicalized makeshift pseudo tyranny.</p>

<p>Makes sense though If history repeats itself then it means that the Turks will rise again as Ottoman Empire 2.0 lead by radical Jihadists who try to invade Europe again, just like Syrian Muslims and a ton of middle East and African Muslims are doing under the guise of refugees</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just don&#39;t know what to think sometimes about Assad.</p>

<p>On one hand I know the propaganda</p>

<p>On the other I&#39;ve seen comments from Syrian people claiming Assad is their only hope for a secular life. </p>

<p>Truth is Obama wasn&#39;t allowed to intervene in Syria. Evidenced by the current president raging at him on twitter in 2013. To defeat ISIS we need to intervene, now I&#39;m liberal but I would be absolutely brutal after I launched a massive propaganda campaign against ISIS followers.</p>

<p>I remember Obama&#39;s red line. I even learned about it from Fox news because I only follow right wing news nowadays. I remember the comments from people bitching about how weak he was. He was never even allowed to go in and defeat ISIS. </p>

<p>As for this particular politician I don&#39;t know anything about him but the praised heaped on him for being right wing. But it seems like it&#39;s his opinion and he should be allowed to have it.</p>

<p>We had a senator in the U.S who said, &quot;We can&#39;t restore our civilization with someone else&#39;s babies.&quot; Effectively turning me away from the right wing forever because he was talking about half white breeds like me. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Is there any question of who the actual terrorists of this world are? These past few years have been very revealing on what is actually going on in the Middle East.</p>

<p>ISIS is a fake enemy that is doing the dirty work for Israel, Saudi Arabia and the US gov&#39;t. The MSM narrative plays out that ISIS is bad, but not reported that they are good for the Zionist agenda in the Middle East. The MSM narrative plays out that the US is fighting against ISIS...which is fake news because the US IS NOT fighting ISIS at all. In fact, Israel, the Saudis and  the US are all supporting, funding and logistically commanding ISIS all the while the MSM tells us that we are there fighting them. We couldn&#39;t have the world thinking it was really the western powers that are the actual terrorists now could we??</p>

<p>But, that fake story all went to hell when the Russians went over there and actually bombed the shit out of ISIS...and the US gov&#39;t got really, really mad. Why? Well, AIPAC for one. The Truth that ISIS is really a proxy for the western terrorists the zionist for another. Russia has been getting demonized within the MSM narrative ever since.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Cuba a socialist paradise? lol ...you should hear some of the horror stories. I actually almost married a cuban girl a dated for a few years and her Dad used to talk about the &#39;camps&#39; and how gays would get beat in the streets, food rationing, limited resources, bribes, bureaucracy, empty grocery store shelves and many other details.....enough to have people risk shark invested waters to come to Florida  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>So you agree Turkey is better off as a democracy?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Temporarily, sure. It allowed them to be secularized, get Nukes, and get taken seriously on the world stage...unfortunately all it takes is one psycho like Erdogan to start reversing all of that and entering into some fascist radicalized makeshift pseudo tyranny.</p>

<p>Makes sense though If history repeats itself then it means that the Turks will rise again as Ottoman Empire 2.0 lead by radical Jihadists who try to invade Europe again, just like Syrian Muslims and a ton of middle East and African Muslims are doing under the guise of refugees</p>
