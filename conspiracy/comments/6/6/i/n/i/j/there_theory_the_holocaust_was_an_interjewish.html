       More or less.  The holocaust was carried out by people who identify as Leviites today (including a lot of Ashkenazis but not exclusive by any means).  Mary (mother of Jesus) was from the priestly tribe of Aaron, whereas Joseph was from Judah.  These basically mean priest class (hidden knowledge) and worldly power (kings of nations).
      </p>
      <p>
       One part of the philosophy of Christianity is that the hidden should be revealed, i.e., the knowledge of the priest class transferred to the people (government, Judah).  Obviously the priests don't want that and you can more or less summarize the last 2,000 years of conflict as an attempt to put the truth back in the bottle by people who prefer to eat of the tree of knowledge of good and evil - manipulate the ignorant / profane.

       It isn't quite that simple.  We have a modern notion of the "Tribe of Levi" but it isn't a real tribe.  Levi was an adjective indicating a choice to join with the serpent originally.  The way to describe them in words people are familiar with today is the synagogue of satan, jews who say they are jews but are not, mystery babylon, masonry.  In other words, being a Leviite is a choice you make like becoming a freemason or a jesuit or something along those lines.  You might call these people "fallen" or no longer with God, therefore not "jews" (God's people).
      </p>
      <p>
       So we might say that the holocaust was carried out by non-jews against jews, but that means something entirely different than blonde haired blue eyed people determined to exterminate folks originating from the middle east.

       Interesting - so, generally speaking, being 'Satanic' (or a mason / Scientologist (of any notable rank, that is)) simply means you chose to join this club of people that actively work to conceal knowledge (generally, just ideas that lead to global human growth &amp; progress (and ironically, the fact that they are being concealed at all)) from the masses, as this is your "best"
       <em>
        idea
       </em>
       to maintain order that you could come up with.
      </p>
      <p>
       Everything else relating to satanism / boogeyman worship is total garbage.
      </p>
      <p>
       My question - we see a lot of artists / performers donning 'Satanist' regalia (think Madonna, lady gaga, cringe-y main stream performers/artists ect.) - I don't believe they worship Moloch or a horned, pitch fork wielding devil; but ARE they actually "in-the-know", so to speak?  Are they actively/intentionally part of the 'priest' or 'king' class (or at least subservient to it) in trying to subdue the masses?
      </p>
      <p>
       Or are they equally clueless, and were just given a cringe-y costume by somebody who knew it would mislead the teenage idol-worshipers and conspiracy theorists a-like into thinking that there might
       <em>
        actually
       </em>
       be something to worshiping our friendly scaly red neighbor from down south?

       At the very top of the occult pyramid, yes.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, many people who are involved legitimately do think they are worshipping some entity.  For example, there are a lot of myths about aliens creating human life.  Often these involve tales that these people came from the Sirius star system or some such.  Scientologists have similar stories like planet Xenu.  Mormons too.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where did this stuff come from?  Well, suppose you know how to navigate by the stars.  If you are devoting mental energy to this, other people will pick up on it.  How to conceal your true mental intentions then?  Wrap it in very emotionally riveting tales.  You look up to Sirius to navigate but you conceal what you are thinking / doing with some fantastical tale about this is where your creator originated or whatever.
      </p>
      <p>
       Enough of this and in some sense it becomes "real."  People who are exposed to the linguistic keys that lead them to the emotions tied up with Sirius can be overcome with the emotions that swirled around it in the past.  It can feel like some other worldly entity moving through you and some people get wrapped up in this with legitimate belief.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sirius rises in July in Egypt / Israel / Iraq and overlaps with the sun.  So the heat of the summer seems to be associated with Sirius - there is less light and heat when Sirius is away from the sun.  Can naively seem like a life giver (growing the crops) literally and figuratively (origination myths).
      </p>
      <p>
       But then you find out that there were active trade routes from America to the Middle East thousands of years ago, that the stars were important for navigation.  So you know why the true purpose of Sirius needed to be guarded.  And you know better than to think Sirius has anything to do with it getting warm during the summer now - just a cosmic coincidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       As far as people being in the know, all of that varies tremendously.  You can get a small sense of that just from this point.  The more you know, the fewer of their myths you can believe.  But, if you are fed a lot of semi-truths it is very easy to feel enlightened yet be more lost than when you started.  Many artists are told what to do.  Some of their instructions come from true believers.  The proportion of true believers even varies greatly over time.  They've had sustained periods of widespread psychosis like mass infection by syphilis, so even describing the proportion of true believers depends on when you are talking about.  More in 1900 than in 2000 for example.

       So if I am understanding you correctly, this could very well describe Greek / Roman mythology - a group of people watched the stars and planets and gained an understanding of astrology and benefited from it in ways - they watched planets' moons &amp; stars colliding/exploding and twisted it into epic stories, like tales about Saturn cannibalizing his children, in order to intellectually enslave people who didn't understand what they were looking at.
      </p>
      <p>
       Modern day education sucks because it still teaches students about mythology, but they totally miss the point - students walk away thinking "our ancestors were all stupid", when they should be walking away thinking "our ancestors were all subdued by the same people subduing us today through shoddy thinking".

       I might add that in reading CS404's explanation there may be a temptation to feel underwhelmed by the secrets these "magicians" were/are hiding. Where's the real power? How could this all be about money?
      </p>
      <p>
       Such a reaction misses the point that these elites were not merely exercising social control, but psychic control. In fact they were leveraging psychic control via mete-narratives to maintain the master/slave divide. A more benevolent decision might have been to construct a meta-narrative that elevated the masses (what Christ's ministry was about) but hey, they ain't called The Synagogue of Satan for nothing, amirite?
      </p>
      <p>
       It is therefore evident that mankind is connected via coherence of consciousness, and TPTB want to keep that cosmic fact shackled by a toxic application of governing mythologies. And if you're a God-fearing Christian like me this only makes Christ's work more glorious.

       In my opinion, its not so much that they are hiding a secret power that is the end-all be-all ; thats what they want you to think.  The reality is that the concealing of knowledge of their control is just THEIR means to achieve order -
      </p>
      <p>
       its like, how can you support the foundation of a building?  You could use spread footings, or piles, or ground improvement, ect.
      </p>
      <p>
       In this analogy, the building is 'society' / order / industry.  If you remove their method of control, or their foundation, the building will collapse (societal collapse) - their methods are crude (like a shitty masonry foundation that leaks and was built on a marsh), but still holds the structure up but you could never add a nice addition like a bigger porch or an indoor pool.
      </p>
      <p>
       Three's method is like a nice water sealed, crack free, steel reinforced concrete foundation that is built on good, free draining and well-compacted structural fill, made to last and be expanded upon.

       I think its merely an obsession with survival - i dont think they have a method of telepathic powers that they are using.  In my opinion, 'telepathy' is really just humans all being on the same page, being all equally informed - but no; we have some people believeing in a God in the skies, some believing in islam, some believing in ghosts, some believe in aliens, all different languages, all different math and science knowledge levels - even just the news on a daily basis is (purposefully) inconsistent and everybody believes something different - we are completely out of sync with each other.  'Telepathy' is all of us really just agreeing with one another on "okay, this IS what we know- nothing more, nothing less; now we can progress together".  And thats the 'one-ness' that they are depriving us of.

        There is astrology in the Bible? Readers who know anything about Christianity may be quite conﬁdent that the Bible contains no information or veneration of ‘heretical’ beliefs like astrology whatsoever. In fact, surely astrology is Pagan and idolatrous and the complete antithesis of Judaism and Christianity. Is that not so?
       </p>
       <p>
        Actually, this is not so at all. Yet so deep-rooted is this common view of Judaeo-Christianity that it may come as a bit of a shock to some readers to learn that astrology was originally a central component of this belief system. But this as not necessarily the kind of daily astrology we ﬁnd in magazines of the modern era, but rather a study and veneration of millennial astrology. This long-term study of the heavens is known as precessional astrology, and it is more akin to what we would now call astronomy, as it is based upon a real astronomical event known as the precession of the equinox.

       Dig deeper, my friend. The article I linked says:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        As readers can perhaps now see, early Judaeo-Christianity was originally a Nazarene-Sabaean stellar cult that looked to the stars and the planets; and the motions of these stellar bodies not only determined future events, they also tracked and documented the lives and reigns of the various monarchs and monarchies. If a monarch is known to have been the third king of the Age of Aries, the date of his reign can be established with some precision and conﬁdence, because his reign is marked and delineated in the movements of the heavens above. In fact, we use the very same chronological system to this day, for the year zero in our current calendar was not set to mark the  birth of Jesus, rather it was set to honour the start of the Age of Pisces.

       More to the story.  Entertainers or movie makers have excellent cover for traveling around the world.  They can put fairly arbitrary destinations on their calendar without being overtly suspicious.  Great way to launder money too - you can buy tens of thousands of albums with cocaine or heroin cash.  Easy way to pay assassins or other covert activities.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The Sothic cycle or Canicular period is a period of 1,461 Egyptian civil years of 365 days each or 1,460 Julian years averaging 365¼ days each. During a Sothic cycle, the 365-day year loses enough time that the start of its year once again coincides with the heliacal rising of the star Sirius (Egyptian: Spdt or Sopdet, "Triangle"; Greek: Σῶθις, Sō̂this) on 19 July in the Julian calendar.
       </p>
       <p>
        It has been noticed, and the Sothic cycle confirms, that
        <strong>
         Sirius does not move retrograde across the sky like other stars
        </strong>
        , a phenomenon widely known as the precession of the equinox. Professor Jed Buchwald wrote "Sirius remains about the same distance from the equinoxes—and so from the solstices—throughout these many centuries,
        <em>
         despite precession

        <p>
         In my book The Giza Template: Temple Graal, Earth Measure, I lay out a defined blueprint for the Giza Plateau based on the idea that Giza was created as a repository for advanced scientific knowledge.

       </blockquote>
       <p>
        <strong>
         The movements of the star Sirius and the Pleiades star cluster are at odds with the current theory of precession in that they do not demonstrate the so-called wobble motion of the Earth’s axis.
        </strong>
        This implies that Sirius and the Pleiades are on a similar trajectory as our solar system. In fact, that is exactly what I have discovered encoded in The Giza Template. I propose that our solar system, the star Sirius and the Pleiades star cluster system were birthed from the same stellar nebula, that being the Great Orion Nebula, M42. These three systems are each on their own spiral trajectory or path, each being separated by time and distance directly related to the Great Year Cycle of 25,920 years. These star systems are moving away from the M42 Nebula in a spiral motion with our ecliptic rolling along like a wheel on a spiral path. This movement defines and explains what we view as precession eliminating the outdated wobbling earth theory. Spiral motion and growth are seen throughout the natural world and should not be dismissed when considering an explanation for precession.
