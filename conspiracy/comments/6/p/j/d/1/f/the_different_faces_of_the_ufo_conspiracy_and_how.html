        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>With all the recent shit about VTL and Revelations being fulfilled, just wanted to clarify how we will be able to know if what we are seeing is government coordinated &quot;soft disclosure&quot;.</p>

<p>The technology. Since the mid 20th century, <em>the powers that be</em> have had the technology to produce cheap to make and wirelessly distribute, free, nonpolluting, power to every corner of the world. They have been using this technology for their own purposes in secret for over 60 years. <a href="http://siriusdisclosure.com/evidence/">http://siriusdisclosure.com/evidence/</a> Steven Greer has been producing hundreds of official documents of black budget secret space programs for public view for decades. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yytSNQ2ogD4&amp;list=PLZpT2CX97ZILq9L3qsyP0hdG4EOt9ltGo">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yytSNQ2ogD4&amp;list=PLZpT2CX97ZILq9L3qsyP0hdG4EOt9ltGo</a> This is all of the Disclosure Project witness testamonies of secret government UFO activity.</p>

<p><a href="https://vimeo.com/133170463">https://vimeo.com/133170463</a> Mark McCandlish, a part of the Disclosure Project, was a conceptual artist for government military contractors and had a look at the black budget programs. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xedmfAgx8eg">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xedmfAgx8eg</a> Here is Phil Schneider talking about the underground network of secret tunnels.</p>

<p>For more information on the technology, research Nikola Tesla, Max Planck, Dan Winter, and others.</p>

<p>So, with all of this, we know that our government has likely been in contact with ETs for at least 50 years during the time that they have had access to faster than speed of light technology.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZnxA8aRLIs">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZnxA8aRLIs</a> The Stan Romanek Story. With what we now know about the CIA&#39;s silencing techniques, I think that it is a good possibility that he was framed for pedophilia.</p>

<p>There is a lot to the UFO conspiracy, but I believe that it is the key to the bigger picture. The facts show that there is a whole other reality that the top elite operate in. We are pathetic to them. Bitching and whining about nonissues. Our small, uneducated minds cannot comprehend the immense interconnectedness of our universe. We would rather sink back into our little worlds.</p>

<p>But here&#39;s the point I was going to make this post for. We will know that we are experiencing REAL DISCLOSURE if our false scarcity based economy is exposed and rid of. We live in a world of abundance, and <em>proper education</em> can effectively solve all of the future&#39;s problems. With real disclosure, every human being on this planet will be able to chase their dreams with unhindered bliss. Every human being will be gifted with the truth of our universe, there will be no fear, no conflict, no misunderstanding.</p>

<p>On the other hand, we will know it&#39;s soft disclosure or bluebeam if a &quot;war&quot; is somehow started. If there is conflict. If people are still unhappy. If money continues to dominate the lives of the masses. If we continue to pollute the planet and waste food, energy and resources.</p>

<p>We live in an upside down world. For a reason. It&#39;s to keep us all down and distracted. Keep us in the dark, out of the light. But we have free will. We have the freedom to educate ourselves. They cannot control that.</p>

<p>I hope some people got something new out of this, feel free to contribute any evidence related to this subject in the comments.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dr. Greer seems the most credible, which makes me want to believe him more than the others talking about UFOs today.  Seems to me like the question isn&#39;t whether or not aliens exist but rather whether or not aliens are friend or foe.

    <div class="md"><p>I really doubt it. Greer is the most adamant about the fact that there are no evil ETs. There is only government corrupted technology. </p>

<p>Trust the facts. Trust the technology. It&#39;s all real. If we get the technology, the powers that be are done forever. That&#39;s it. That&#39;s all that&#39;s standing in our way. Money is the center of the grand conspiracy. And oil=money. With this technology, oil is a thing of the past. Money is a thing of the past. Scarcity is a thing of the past. Learning, abundance, <em>culture</em> will be allowed to develop and flourish. </p>

<p>The government already has us. Personally, I think their plan was to use Islam and terror to subdue the population into giving up their freedoms, and eventually completely sever all of our connections to each other, putting us into a dystopian future. And I think that Hillary was going to start wwiii to finish Russia off and kill half the population at the same time. </p>

<p>But now, hopefully, there are nice ETs taking charge and have connections throughout humanity and have a plan for disclosure that they are getting ready to execute. And after it&#39;s over, the world will be much more light and love filled than before.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>While I can&#39;t say Alex Collier is legitimate, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQZgAEA95s8">in this 1994 interview he claims to have been in contact with Andromedans</a> who have give him the run down of the problems on Earth - TPTB given as a group of humans selling off their race to placate the pressures of a military consortium from Orion, class as a means of conditioning favor to a hierarchical system for eventual disclosure of evil ETs so we join them without fuss, etc. His message overall is useful in my mind - our duty as something like taking the responsibility of the human race to help itself seriously and fight these influences.

    <div class="md"><p>excellent post mate. I have mixed feelings about Greer and his &quot;only good ET&#39;s&quot; theory, I also think that the amount of money he&#39;s charging people to go to that CSETI  ranch or whatever it is, is super shady. but hey the guy is getting shit done so...</p>

<p>I also think that his idea of only good ETs is a bit naive, but I just think that there&#39;s so much that it&#39;s impossible for any of us to know if that&#39;s true or not. But it has to start somewhere. And I think the disclosure project is a great start. </p>

<p>you&#39;re right ....that is exactly what it is, naive.</p>

<p>although I also think there is much more going on here and the whole phenomenon is far far stranger to be explained as just &quot;extraterrestrials with high technology&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah dude, there&#39;s also 60+ years of secret government use of high technology. Plus ET use. And the high technology is far stranger than most people can believe. It eventually gets to old myths about &quot;magic&quot; and well guess what? Magic is real, teleportation is real, telekinesis is real, antigravity is real, age reversal technology is real, there is so much more to our DNA than anyone realizes. </p>

<p>Our entire reality is completely false. And it&#39;s gonna take awhile I think for people to get that, but I think they will eventually if we get a chance to begin pushing for more and more disclosure after we get a taste. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you guys want mind numbing revelation I would highly suggest reading The Urantia Papers. It talks about the origin and history of the universe, the earth, the first humans, Lucifer, Adam and Eve, religion, and Jesus all in one book. Truth resonates through your thoughts to your emotions until it manifest goose bumps and that buzzing feeling above your head. </p>

<p>Here is one snippet.</p>

<p>1) ADAM AND EVE arrived on Urantia, from the year A.D. 1934, 37,848 years ago. It was in midseason when the Garden was in the height of bloom that they arrived. At high noon and unannounced, the two seraphic transports, accompanied by the Jerusem personnel intrusted with the transportation of the biologic uplifters to Urantia, settled slowly to the surface of the revolving planet in the vicinity of the temple of the Universal Father. All the work of rematerializing the bodies of Adam and Eve was carried on within the precincts of this newly created shrine. And from the time of their arrival ten days passed before they were re-created in dual human form for presentation as the world’s new rulers. They regained consciousness simultaneously. The Material Sons and Daughters always serve together. It is the essence of their service at all times and in all places never to be separated. They are designed to work in pairs; seldom do they function alone.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is an unavoidable spiritual conflict going on in space. It is between those who belive others should be free and those who believe others should be enslaved to serve themselves. The freedom seekers believe in the golden rule. The slave seekers believe that might makes right. Thus, they conflict over the freedom of souls, which are multi-lifetime containers of thought, belief, experience and personality.</p>

<p>The dark secret of the dark is that they are spiritual parasites. They have lived on the backs of others for a long time. Even inside their own cultures, they step all over the young and the weak to gratify themselves and condition each other into their parasitic way of life. They repeat abuse patterns on each other for gratification, circling the drain of spiritual energy. Alone, they suffer spiritual entropy. </p>

<p>Over time these slave seekers discover a resource that life makes that cannot be mined or replicated by technology. That is emotional/spiritual energy. It has the potential to give intense pleasure, vitality and mind over matter abilities. So, being the unscrupulous, self-serving beings they are, they choose not to restrain themselves from harvesting it. They&#39;ve probably already been harvesting it without realizing the mechanics of it. </p>

<p>In order to harvest this energy, the dark coerces people physically and mentally with slavery and deception. They have to override informed free will consent, because nobody wants to give up this resource willingly. In order to extract this energy, beings must experience negative emotional states. Those states make them feel drained, depressed, miserable. Then these dark beings who live in those negative emotional states can absorb the energy through emotional resonance. This is also why misery loves company, why sadists torture and bullies torment. They get high off of it, like a drug user.</p>

<p>The dark uses our elites to create fear and suffering on our world, so we release this energy and they can consume it. We make the energy when we are in positive emotional states. We feel more joyful, envigorated, fulfilled, our spirits energized to move our bodies. We are farm animals to these useless eaters. They think that because they are better at competition, they deserve it. They even enslave themselves with their choice. They are just carriers of a spiritual disease, a virus. Our Cosmic immune system has AIDS, that is the false light.</p>

<p>The false light&#39;s purpose is to appropriate the appealing aspects of the light while destroying any immune response to this disease. So they tell us universal, unconditional forgiveness and love are absolutely necessary. They tell us killing the dark will not solve the problem. They insist we ignore how the dark affects us and focus only on our own selves. They help us make more emotional energy without ridding ourselves of the parasites sucking it away. </p>

<p>The false light will refuse to acknowledge that trauma is the means of transmission of this disease. They pretend it has a negligible effect on behavior compared to free will choice. Well, trauma creates expectations of more trauma, which creates fear, which puts us into negative emotional states, which blocks out positive emotional states, which makes us hungry for joy, which makes us susceptible to enjoying company in misery, schadenfreude. When we get addicted to that second hand emotional energy we become just like them. Then they can easily control us with rewards and punishments, as we don&#39;t care about anyone but ourselves. We become self-serving machines. The false light will have you believe that this is all choice. Yet, choices are made by drawing on past experiences and resultant expectations. </p>

<p>In short, the false light allows the dark to condition us to their way of life. The false light would have us believe the only other option is to effectively submit to the dark by letting them thieve emotional energy with virtual impunity. They are a good cop bad cop tag team. If you don&#39;t submit to the dark as false light, you are considered dark, for not forgiving and loving, of course. Then they&#39;ll just let the dark give you even lore trauma, because you&#39;ve &quot;made your choice&quot;. Then choosing the dark is virtually inevitable, like eating odd, unhealthy things in extreme hunger. </p>

<p>The real light recognizes that beings have free will and don&#39;t deserve to be food for other beings like this. Don&#39;t let titles or labels fool you. Much of the real light won&#39;t even call itself that. Look at the fruit of the proposals, the behaviors that are proscribed and also the behaviors the proscibers exhibit. </p>

<p>What will come of their proposals? Freedom or slavery? Ongoing parasitism or the health of the whole? Who do they serve in their actions, freedom seekers or slave seekers? </p>

<p>Do they inspire independent thought? Do they inspire fear or love with their behavior, beliefs and proposals? </p>

<p>Keep in mind that fear is not evil, but an easily hackable self defense system, an easy environment for deceivers to operate and also a means of these parasites feeding on others. Good beings will tell you about bad things that make you feel fear, so that you can understand and overcome them. The intent of freedom is the key thing to look for. Submit to unseen identities or unaccountable organizations or demand to have evidence and understanding before belief? </p>

<p>THIS is how you know them by their fruit. The dark already comes as the light to many freedom seeking individuals as channeled beings. Not all channeled beings are slave seekers, but there are plenty of them and you can&#39;t verify their identities. The utility of impersonating the light cannot be ignored by these self-serving beings. The light is easily trusted, which is utility for deception. Also, by making the light look bad, you can subtly persuade beings to choose the dark side. The dark impersonates anyone it finds utility in impersonating, including God and Lucifer.</p>

<p>The reason why your emotional energy can bend reality is that God is consciousness. All consciousness is God. You and I and all other life is God. It doesn&#39;t mean we own each other. Or does it dark one? The dark hides this knowledge from us. We get to explore apparently being separate from the creator, sampling religion, atheism, mysticism, and wonder. They get high off our energy. It&#39;s a system we supposedly set up.</p>

<p>I find it interesting that this situation could be solved in an beautiful way, or an infinite variety of ways based on the concept outline here. The administrator personality of this container of existence could simply do some Ju Jitsu. I&#39;ll explain.</p>

<p>The two major camps are working to pull us all in opposite directions, freedom or slavery, creation or entropy, life or death. The administrator, the local God if you will, doesn&#39;t have to convince anyone that life, creation and freedom are best. No, he could simply agree with everyone. As if they are in a tug of war, he could cut the rope and announce that everybody wins.</p>

<p>Those who seek freedom shall live with those that agree with them. Those who seek slavery shall live with those that agree with them. The benefits and burdens of each choice will be isolated to their respective containers.</p>

<p>Freedom seekers would love this. They just wanted to enjoy their own existence unmolested. Slave seekers would be pissed, but they&#39;d have no valid rhetorical argument that wouldn&#39;t make them look like the parasites they are. They also couldn&#39;t wiggle their way out of this apparent judgement, which it isn&#39;t. God let them judge themselves. They decided slavery for others, and so in their isolation based on agreement, they received what they choose to give. In theory, they could change their minds and not suffer their own selves, but by this time the choices are pretty solid on both sides.</p>

<p>They might complain that they don&#39;t have spiritual food in their new reality. Why not make it yourself like your opponents did? You don&#39;t want to work. If they insist on getting free energy from others, he could say that those others chose freedom. Take it from those who chose to take it from others. They might say, screw their free will choice. Then God could say, well then screw yours. Off you go.</p>

<p>In essence, separation of these two types of spiritual seekers, of freedom or slavery for consciousness, ends the slave seekers by their own hands and frees the freedom seekers to give themselves great gifts of peace, harmony, freedom and joy. Parasites require hosts, but hosts do not require parasites. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What an amazing post. Thank you for taking the time to write all that.</p>

<p>The last sentence particularly is what defeats duality. One of the greatest lies of the dark forces is their insistence that in order for good to exist an opposite evil must also exist. The statement is only deceptive because it only works in one direction.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Parasites require hosts, but hosts do not require parasites. </p></li>
<li><p>In the end of the day. They need us but we don&#39;t need them.</p></li>
<li><p>It is impossible to kill someone who was never born.</p></li>
<li><p>It is impossible for a thief to steal an object that does not exist. Someone must create the object first and only then it can be stolen. </p></li>
</ul>

<p>In is said in some of the Sumerian texts that gods came to Earth because their workers (or slaves) went on strike and refused to work anymore and they needed new slaves. Thus enters the purpose of man to be slaves for the gods. The previous slaves of these parasites figured out the riddle. Parasites require hosts, but hosts do not require parasites. When enough humans crack the riddle and go on strike the story will have come full circle and the parasites will move on in search of new hosts.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What inspires me to type it out repeatedly is reading about the dark shenanigans, knowing their basic agendas and behaviors, and then boiling with the emotional energy of correction.</p>

<p>This energy of correction is the other side of the coin of forgiveness. When correction occurs, the emotional energy of correction diminishes and forgiveness is much easier. As the unjust situation continues, so does this emotional energy. It is to compel us to be a macroscopic immune system for our existence.</p>

<p>I regularly spend time contemplating how and why I think and feel the ways that I do. This is introspection, knowing yourself. It teaches a lot that others won&#39;t or can&#39;t teach you. The knowledge easily carries over into understanding other people, who are much like ourselves. I contemplated the request of the supposed light to forgive the dark and I discovered why I can&#39;t.</p>

<p>They still intend harm and they are unrestrained by external forces. The unjust situation is not corrected. I can&#39;t <del>forgive them</del> release the energy of correction until they change, die, or live in a secure prison container. The emotions shift as I expect them to, now. My logic and emotion are aligned perfectly and I feel very good about that. Before I understood, I was torn, trying to be a what appeared to be good person as I was asked. I am not alone in how I feel. I see other people behave the same way without realizing what is going on or why. </p>

<p>We have to realize, define and understand what is occurring to come to terms with it. When the supposed light asks me to betray my logic <em>and</em> emotions, preserving access to hosts for parasites, I know they are corrupted. Trust yourself, not titles, organizations or images. If you know something is wrong, explore it. Don&#39;t buy dogma, ever. It&#39;s a tool of evil, of mind control. Never trust without a solid, verifiable identity and a track record of behavior either. This false light comes in unaccountable ways, so it can deceive over and over again, pretending to be independent from the last false light deceivers. </p>

<p>In my attempt to accommodate the request of the supposed light I discovered that I felt an emotion that resembles Stockholm syndrome. It made me feel like a slave, broken, submitting to abusers that intend to repeat abuse. I just couldn&#39;t do it. It really feels to me like I am breaking my free spirit and submitting my will to spiritual slavery. I am now convinced this is a corrupt act, even if those who ask for it are not evil beings. The act serves evil beings. I cannot submit. I&#39;d rather die in a painful, impotent, pathetic bloodbath of resistance than willingly submit and endure these spiritual parasites.</p>
