       DISCLAIMER: I make NO conclusions about VoTL or Tom Delonge in this post. I simply intend to look at the facts and give my opinion as to whats going on.
      </h1>
      <h2>
       Introduction
      </h2>
      <p>
       Today,
       <a href="https://twitter.com/KibBitzLaw/">
        Victory of the Light
       </a>
       teased that the disclosure process is beginning and even cryptically tweeted at
       <a href="https://twitter.com/KibBitzLaw/status/889537473340198912">
        Tom Delonge
       </a>
       that we are not far off. I want to dig into what VoTL and Tom Delonge are claiming, and whether or not we should be wary/skeptical of this imminent disclosure event.
      </p>
      <h2>
       Managing Magic
      </h2>
      <p>
       I recently read a book called Managing Magic: The governments UFO disclosure plan by Grant Cameron. In this book Cameron makes a compelling case for the "Magicians" and the "Messiahs" in relation to the UFO phenomena. The "Magicians" are people like
       <a href="https://tothestars.media/blogs/news/read-jim-semivans-foreword-for-sekret-machines-chasing-shadows-paperback-edition">
        Jim Semivan
       </a>
       who are responsible for feeding the information to a given "Messiah" who in this instance is
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_DeLonge">
        Tom Delonge
       </a>
       . What happens is that essentially the govt chooses someone with a large following and spoonfeeds their ego such that they feel they are the only capable person of bringing this sensitive information to the public. Grant Cameron talks extensively about this in
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9686CJRpUIM">
        this video
       </a>
       . He also talks about how Military think tanks have planned a disclosure process for over 30 years now with the intention of priming humanity's subconscious for disclosure by embedding the ideas in fiction and pop culture. As I'm sure most are aware, Tom Delonge's project Sekret Machines is meant to put the ideas of the UFo phenomena into fiction first revealing the reality of Remote Viewing projects and metaphysical realities.
      </p>
      <h2>
       Tom Delonge
      </h2>
      <p>
       If Tom Delonge is the govt's chosen "Messiah", then can we really trust him? A few days ago Tom posted
       <a href="http://imgur.com/a/A2r2r">
        this
       </a>
       heavily implying that some type of disclosure event will be occurring very soon and VoTL's tweet to him seems to imply that VoTL believes we are in the beginning stages as well. Tom Delonge was in contact with John Podesta as we found out during wikileaks and it seems that he was the chosen Messiah for this message dating back a few years. This led me to conclude that Delonge's handlers (Magicians) had intended for HRC to win and had an entire roadmap laid out for that timeline. When Trump won, Delonge posted a lot to social media that there was a wrench in the plans but that something would materialize shortly. All of that hype and we are at this point, which the most hyped up post Tom has ever made being 3 days ago. The question to ask yourself is: What were Delonge's Magicians planning to disclose if HRC won vs a Trump victory? Is this some type of newer Project Blue Beam agenda?
      </p>
      <h2>
       Victory of the Light
      </h2>
      <p>
       I have followed VoTL since the beginning and they have sparked my curiosity far more than I ever anticipated. For those unaware VoTL claims to be in contact with Pleaidan guides and they are apart of the COBRA resistance group which has some loose ties to Corey Goode/David Wilcock. Without taking a stance on whether or not they are in contact with actual ETI, their sources appear to be legitimate and their insider information is what is most valuable part about the twitter account. If they can be believed (and they seem to have insider info on the #swordfish leaks) then this disclosure event is imminent and will be very public. They have hyped up the Sept 23 date and the impending July 27 date that WH anon just confirmed.
      </p>
      <h2>
       Disclosure?
      </h2>
      <p>
       I believe that there appears to be an imminent disclosure type event that has been in the works for a long time within resistant intelligence groups across the United States Government. This disclosure event seems to have multiple factions yet they all seem to be receiving similar insider information. I only bring this information forward to discuss whether or not this will be soft or full disclosure and whether or not you guys believe these contacts to be legitimate.
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT: What are your guys' thoughts on Delonge and VoTL?

       The term Messiah is used by Cameron because he points out that the military targets people with big egos who believe themselves to be Messiahs. So in this scenario Delonge only BELIEVES he's a Messiah. He thinks he's the one with the most information on the UFO phenomena and he's the only one who can bring the truth to the public which we all know is false.

       In all actuality it's really not that crazy.  Delonge has been obsessed with UFOs for literally forever, has done legitimate work with the disclosure movement and he has a very sizeable following from blink-182 and AVA.  He would be the perfect pop culture figure to help roll this out.

       99.9% this is real. The way you can identify BS is by checking the symmetry of the information. Truth is symmetrical and nothing is out of place with VOTL. He has dropped 7000 tweets and I haven't see a single red flag yet.

       My only concern at this point is to know when this party is going to start. If we are lucky, it might start in hours..

       Okay?
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't recall calling him a shill, larper or crazy liar. In fact, I'm usually one of the people on here who's always posting in VOTL threads. I follow his Twitter pretty closely, but I don't have anyone to talk to about it in my real life. So I like to talk about the various things I notice about it on here.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know why you're being so defensive. I never said he had to be perfect, I was merely replying to "I haven't seen a single red flag yet".
      </p>
      <p>
       I have seen what I would consider red flags. Does it mean he's a larper? No. Does it mean he's a shill? No. Does it mean he's a crazy liar? No.

       Does it mean I don't unconditionally believe it all with 100% of my being? Yes. Hence why I said it's a "red flag"

       Every time they do, they shoot themselves in the foot. There is no way to be evil without having all these problems that come with it. If VOTL is a high level white hat powerful enough to have access to CIA files and protection against black hat Illuminati, then shutting down twitter would not only be difficult but there would be serious blowback if anyone was to shut it down.

       Too much of a threat. But, I know they can't wipe us out this time. I mean, last time they failed miserably. But this time is very different, we are on a different trajectory.

       Disclosure will happen but VOTL got on my shitlist when he said Defango shouldn't be trusted for no reason.
      </p>
      <p>
       Looks like a really neatly crafted LARP providing actual good info.
      </p>
      <p>
       In short: Yeah we heading there regardless of VOTL

       LARP has been a word for a while, I've been seeing it applied to disclosure/"event" type people/4chan posts for a good while now though.
      </p>
      <p>
       I feel like they say it mostly because of genuine disbelief, the info they put out is too good to be true, and there's usually not much to back it up.
      </p>
      <p>
       If they were throwing the word around to disinfo and muddy the waters, that would imply those using the word against those people have some information that we don't.

       LARP= Live Action Role Playing. It started out as an activity where people would dress up as knights and wizards and "fight" in parks and stuff. Like a Role Playing game, but Live Action.
      </p>
      <p>
       So now they use the term for people they believe to be larping (pretending) to be FBI, White House staff, etc.

       I saw this comment on one of his videos the other day:
"We have to give a little bit of a benefit of a doubt. Maybe Defango doesn't even know he's fucking with Satanists. You guys know some people get sucked in and don't even know it until it's too late. People are told they are doing good works. An eastern star lady told me all they do is service work. For 97% of these organizations it's true. The people at the lowest levels are not usually the ones in the know. All these younger ops are just being brought in. D, my love, if all the agents in this room raised their hands you'd shit your computer chair. ﻿"

       I very much agree with what you are saying here. I'm wary of Tom being just another disinformation agent, even without hearing what you posted. A sense? My gut.  on the other hand votl is talking my language. Talking to the inner conspiracy theorist in me who understands what's going on.

       Yeah... that's the biggest hesitation for me about VoTL. Everything they say has lined up or matched with my own research it almost seems too good to be true. At least we'll find out soon enough I suppose.

       Rings true. Definitely. Especially if you know about cobra and the resistance movement.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm always careful if that's a well laid trap. But generally it makes some sense. I'm patient though. I would definitely like to part of what helps bring this system down so we can change a lot of things very soon. Industry and capitalism are becoming our own demise. And the pedophilia in hollywood thing is beyond disturbing. Lots of work to do.

       Surely it does. At least our reality seen through the lens of media, entertainment, and politics. A house of tarot cards built on deception.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most the truth is hidden within media. Or it's mentioned. Part of the delusion is not even seeing what is before our eyes. Accepting it as normal. That's when we get lazy and the creeps lurking around every corner to correct you appear.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm less fearful of an alien invasion than I am the government who hides that 'their heeeere' in my movies growing up ,while never officially acknowledging they were here , themselves. And you don't know when you are 6 years old the cia is working with Hollywood to cast spells over the nation. You don't find that out till all the narratives have already been programmed by the media into our minds. If you start to scratch the surface.

       I wouldn't trust any group called cobra. Forget about GI Joe even. The snake has ties to Lucifer and the dark side. Knowledge so common you have to know it when you name your group Cobra. I don't trust VOTL. Disclosure is coming I believe that. His stuff rings true but I have slightly different theories on this stuff. I believe they will come out with the "malevolent" ones first and then in comes the "benevolent" ones to save humanity. I believe they are two sides of the same coin just like politics, magic, "aliens" are the same. I won't trust any of them. The great deception is coming. They all work for the dark one.

       very good point. people seem to hear what "their research" has led them to and are just too eager to get any disclosure. this could easily be  the single biggest event most of us live through and it's imperative we continue to ask as many questions and questions narratives as much as possible.

       One of the reasons I have suspected a trap. That fucking name has bothered me since day one. I don't care what it's an amalgam for. Compression resistance breakthrough...something
      </p>
      <p>
       Only thing symbolically relevant is that the resistance movement is underground. But the snake affiliation is not cool.
      </p>
      <p>
       Allthe alien talk on the cobra site I can't disprove. Can't prove it though either. Some times I suspect a larp to sell rocks. Of all things. As he will go months without saying anything important, then all of a sudden everyone needs a fifty dollar rock to help ground the planet in a special way. Those are classic gimics used in religion. It's very unnerving. All and all he posts maybe one piece of pertinent info a month. People hang on those words but it's more the people doing any progress than him or some group saving us that we never met.
      </p>
      <p>
       We have to get very expensive tachyon chambers. Etc. These are props that aren't efficiently proven to do anything. For all I know the stones are nothing. But apparently we are Waiting on people to buy them to ground the light energies. What's with the economical approach to liberation from an economical approach?
      </p>
      <p>
       This whole thing is fishy as hell. The man says he has been to other planets. Withholds everything. Supposedly he has all this Intel. Just withholds it and releases very minor snippets about tptb that users of this sub already post. And all proof of aliens is obscured , convoluted, conjectured. Not a single tangible physical piece of evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       He posts pictures of places in China. Not one explanation. Talks about portals opening. Where? To an underground world that hates us?? Again, no evidence just a carrot of a potential event supplanted with a unproven contact with e.t.
      </p>
      <p>
       So what is one supposed to believe in all of that?

       I find it amazing how easily non religious people accept the existence of aliens because EVOLUTION baby! But they refuse to even entertain the possibility that aliens are the fallen angels and demons of the bible because if demons are real...so is God. They believe some benevolent aliens are going to come here and save us all from ourselves but the idea of Christ the Redeemer coming here to save those who believe is LUDICROUS!
      </p>
      <p>
       The more time goes on the more true the bible and its warnings become to me. Sure you can argue that TPTB wrote the bible and therefore are just bringing about their plan as they wrote it. Ok...why the agenda to attack Christianity, remove it from school, turn believers into atheist evolutionists, murdering of Christians all over the world, destruction of secular governments who protected Christians, promotion of luciferian religions in all its many forms? If it is but a fable written up by TPTB to enslave mankind what made them stop promoting it and instead attacking it?
      </p>
      <p>
       I am not some uneducated bible thumper. I am a truth seeker. I don't care what the Truth turns out to be I just want it. I was brought up Christian. When I was a teenager I quit going to o church and decides God wasn't real. I had way too many questions that nobody wanted or could answer. So I began my solo journey. I studied everything. Psychology, Ethics, Evolution, Buddhism, Jainism, Hinduism, Shintoism, Gnosticism, Judaism, Kabbalah, Catholicism, Islam, etc etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have called myself Buddhist, Hindu, Gnostic (still makes the most sense to me). I found truth in all these things as well as many problems. I have had personal experiences where I was saved by God and specifically Jesus when I shouted out for him seconds away from certain death. I feel the Lord I feel Jesus. I came full circle back to Christianity with Gnostic applications feeling the most true to me.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just walk around talking about Jesus(Yahushua) sometime. People hate it. They can't stand the word.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe a great deception as prophesied in the bible is coming. I believe that great deception will be the alien lie and the proliferation of the one world religion(new age). I am not here to convert anyone I am just here to offer my take on the way I see things progressing around me.

       Indeed. My name has multiple meanings behind it and I chose it for numerous reasons. One of those is that I hope one day people will look back to it or browse their my comment history after the time of Jacob's Trouble has begun and eventually they will one day go "huh, maybe those Christians weren't so Crazy afterall..." Mind you I fully intend to NOT be here when that day comes. It's a parting gift of truth of sorts.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your comment mentioned a critical point that I loved, it's not about being a Bible "thumper," it's about genuinely seeking the
       <strong>
        TRUTH
       </strong>
       . And like it or not people, the Truth is contained in the Word of God. Jesus is the Truth, the Way, and the Life afterall. None shall come to the Father except through Him.
      </p>
      <p>
       Truth is quite uncomfortable at times. It's hard to admit that we are all imperfect sinners, that most of our deeds are evil, that we were born into a fallen world under a sentence of death. But it is Truth nonetheless. When I started my spiritual journey not too long ago that was one of my goals: 1) Learn the truth 2) Speak the truth. Unashamed, unabridged, uncensored, NOT the politically correct watered/dumbed down version that we see spread around today.
      </p>
      <p>
       You nailed another point in that if TPTB were responsible for authoring the Bible and using it to fulfill 'their' wishes (as so many on this sub are under the delusion of), then why in the hell would they fight against it so hard? It makes no logical sense. If they were responsible for it, then they would be pushing FOR it, not so vehemently AGAINST it like they do.
      </p>
      <p>
       I like to slighly modify a quote from the X-Files to come up with this: "
       <strong>
        They
       </strong>
       want
       <strong>
        You
       </strong>
       to
       <em>
        believe
       </em>
       ..."
      </p>
      <p>
       Believe in lies such as aliens, pleidians, reptilians, and on and on that is. Just as long as you don't come to believe in the
       <strong>
        TRUTH
       </strong>
       .

       Beautiful points.
      </p>
      <p>
       Go looking for the Truth and you are bound to find Jesus. You are also bound to find the devil. Then you have to choose a side. Everything falls into place.
      </p>
      <p>
       All the self proclaimed redpilled people out there. The alien deception is what I call the blackpill. If you do not have Jesus and you accept these alien who show up, and I do believe they will in my lifetime and very soon it seems, you will have your redpills negated. This blackpill is their ultimate secret weapon. Basically a vaccine against the redpills.  You will be bluepilled at that point. Then you accept their chips, their tech, their augmentation, transhumanist garbage and you are all but lost at that point. Accept Jesus. Embrace the Holy Spirit. Receive the discernment.

       I agree with this persons interpretation that revelation12 is about Mary giving birth to Jesus. So I wm not sure what the signification of this astrological alignment is. Still much to read.

       Ughh, it's so easy for me to take for granted that there is a ton of mis-information out there regarding what this sign actually represents. That site you listed is definetly one of them. I won't spend too much time bashing it, but I should point out several things they get wrong:
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Ignoring The Very Next Verse
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       It's ironic that what they use to disprove the meaning of this Great Sign, is the VERY thing that seperates this sign from ALL the others that have come before it that were "close but no cigar". An 80% fulfillment of prophecy is not 100% like this is. Even below they attempt to show this sign was at Jesus' supposed birth in 9/11/3bc, but when you look that date up in astronomy software you will find that there is no symbolic pregnancy with a retro-grade orbit in the 'womb' of the gestation period like you find in this years fulfillment, only that Jupiter passes 'through,' therefore is NO symbolic pregnancy. The pregnancy is the key portion of this sign that seperates it from all others that were "close". Details matter people...
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        "Caught Up" vs "Ascended?"
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Ironically, despite this author having another article that downplays the rapture, they failed to use the actual greek words in this context to attempt to prove their point. None of the verses listed in Luke, Mark or Acts use the word 'harpazo'. You can't use english texts to argue the meaning of Biblical words, you MUST go back to the source language!! The words used to describe Jesus ascension are completely different than the meaning behind 'harpazo'.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm already tired of reading this article (i've seen it before btw). They don't even mention the second valid interpretation of the 'woman' which represents Israel, let alone the 3rd. They bash Scottie Clarke alot, I suggest you go actually watch his videos and see what you think rather than reading their jaded opinion of him, particular the Part One &amp; Two videos :
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/eternalrhythmflow/videos">
        Scottie Clarke YouTube
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       They also miss about a dozen other symbolic and numerical patters that all point to 2017 being a year of prophetic continuation... Articles like this (and others like it, such as the false Jesuit Catholic Astronomer organization that poorly attempts to debunk it and flat out lies in their 'facts') which by no coincidence appears as the top Google search results unfortunately.
      </p>
      <p>
       To me it's almost as if people don't WANT it to be true. I rarely see people that humble themselves before God, and pray for discernment, truth &amp; wisdom (I did, still do). It's like they think there is NOTHING more contained within the Living Word of God, and that all the scholars over the last 2k years figured it all out and there's nothing left to discover. It's almost as if they purposely are ignoring the prophecies in Daniel that talk about information being locked up until the "last days", just as it is now. Sorry, it really gets to me and i'm pretty tired of it by now ...
      </p>

      <p>
       Please see a previous comment I made that compiles some of the info (there's so much it's ridiculous). There are several links contained within there as well. I'll list a few below too.
      </p>

      <p>
       (Seriously, please read comment. Its long, but has a ton of info in bullet-list form.)
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       I refer a lot of people to Unsealed.org because I feel it has the largest compilation of info online to date about this subject, and they have done a good job defending the validity of this sign against  the blind nay-sayer's that don't have (nor asked) for the wisdom to discern what it truly means. I have no affiliation with them whatsoever, and it's by no means the only source I use. I read many things from many places, and this is the best source of truth I have yet found that compiles a ton of information on this subject.

       I have not made up my mind nor did I mean to frustrate you. I appreciate your words and your links. I have read the first link so far and am working my way down.
      </p>
      <p>
       So far I have a couple thoughts.
      </p>
      <p>
       Firstly "However, a woman in labor is not standing when she gives birth, she's lying prone, and that's exactly how the alignment is arranged in the sky - the woman is lying prone with her feet up and the moon is directly below her feet, almost as a pillow of sorts. "
      </p>
      <p>
       I disagree with this as many women give birth standing, my wife for example, though I will concede this is not the norm.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have studied pretrib rapture at length and have been convinced that it is not accurate. If you can prove otherwise I am open to it but as my beliefs stand now I do not agree with the proposal that rapture could occur on sept 23.
      </p>
      <p>
       Back to the links. Thank you.

       Please know that my frustration has nothing to do with you and entirely on what I have read over and over again online from others that genuinely seem like they don't "want" this sign to be true, and not genuinely analyzing it with Biblical eyes of discernment. The fact that you are even researching into it is fantastic, many people won't even bother to give it any time of day and seem to be under the delusion that the state of the world we live in can just go on indefinetly without divine intervention, which completely baffles me. I've been doing this for awhile now, and i've seen just about every argument
       <em>
        against
       </em>
       it under the sun, and they all have fallen short. Part of the frustration undoubtedly comes from this attitude I see around that people seem to think that they have unlocked all the secrets &amp; mysteries in the Bible. It's like they're saying God isn't infinite or all-knowing enough to keep certains truths hidden until the last days (for a very good reason), just as He said He would. I applaude anyone that goes searching for Truth with an open mind. You may not come to the same conclusion as I have, but at least you were willing to give it a go.
      </p>
      <p>
       I should probably add a disclaimer that the sites I link to I don't necessarily agree with 100% of everything they have to say, but I agree with a lot more more than I do not, and they are the best sources of compilations of info I have found to date. (I was making my own site, but it quickly became such a massive undertaking and I don't feel that I have the time to complete it anymore. Additionally I found that others had already done similar sites, so I might as well piggyback on their work rather than re-invent the wheel on my own).
      </p>
      <p>
       I agree with you that the woman standing up doesn't discount her giving labor by any means. In fact, I would venture to guess that a standing or squating birth was far more common in the old days than we think.
      </p>
      <p>
       The pre-trib rapture is a very difficult study. When I started down the prophecy rabbit-hole I also did not think it added up. I didn't think there was enough support in the Bible for it, nor did I think we were "worthy" of escaping what is coming during the 7-year tribulation period, aka - Jacob's Trouble or Daniel's 70th week. I prayed about it, asked to be given wisdom &amp; knowledge regarding this subject, and after some time had gone by and I had looked at all different points of view on the subject I eventually gathered enough material from the Bible that I am now fully convinced that the pre-trib rapture is not only true, but it is actually the
       <strong>
        only
       </strong>
       one that fits the Word perfectly, and leaves no loose ends hanging.
      </p>
      <p>
       That topic is far beyond the scope of this reply, but I would like to point out some ideas regarding it that most people do not take into consideration that you may find interesting and wish to do a deeper study on. I believe this is one of the 'mysteries' revealed in the NT, and like most prophetic things are fore-shadowed and have direct analogies to it in the OT.
      </p>
      <p>
       One of the core things to study is the 7 holy festivals from
       <strong>
        Leviticus 23
       </strong>
       and expand upon those. These provide a "divine outline" that is already partially fulfilled by Jesus and the conception of the Church as revealed in  the book of Acts.
      </p>
      <p>
       Note that the first 4 have been fulfilled to the literal day by Jesus, and were given to the Israelites in the OT which directly fore-shadowed Jesus and what He did, in addition to the future events that are still left to fulfill. You can look this up in the Gospels and Acts and it confirms the fulfillment
       <strong>
        down to the literal day
       </strong>
       (Hebrew's/God's calendar is a roaming lunar one, NOT the roman calendar we use today)

      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Unleavened Bread
       </strong>
       - The 2nd day of the festival. Leaven = Sin. Bread = Body. Unleavened Bread = Sinless Body. This is the day Jesus was buried.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>

      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Feast of Trumpets
       </strong>
       - This one is critical and the next in-line to be fulfilled. It involved watchmen standing atop the Temple, waiting for the first sliver of the crescent moon to show indicating the beginning of this 2-day festival where the temple was opened and there was a SEVEN day celebration. The shofars (trumpets) were blown, and if you didn't get into the temple in time, the doors were shut and you were shut outside. They could know 'around' the time this festival was, but not the exact day or hour since it is based off the visibility of the sliver of the crescent moon, not just the new moon as most of the other festivals were based off of.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Day of Atonement
       </strong>
       - This is the only festival that was NOT a celebration. It was a very somber day, where the sins of the people would be placed symbolically on the goat from the high priest (Aaron back then). This represents the 7 year tribulation period that begins soon.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Festival of Booths/Tabernacles
       </strong>
       - Represents the Millennium kingdom period after the tribulation. It is also recorded in Zechariah that during the millennium this specific festival will still be continued to be celebrated.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       There are also other names these go by, such as the Feast of Trumpets is more commonly known today as
       <strong>
        Rosh Hashanah
       </strong>
       . This is the 7th month on the Hebrew calendar which begins their New Year (5778). Hebrew days also begin at SUNSET the previous day (begin in darkness, end in light. Even this is symbolic of the Day of the Lord and this pattern has been established since the creation of the world in Genesis)
      </p>
      <p>
       This year it begins on Wed, September 20th at sunset and ends on sunset on Fri, September 22nd. The very next day, on the Sabbath, is the REV12 on September 23. Since every festival has been fulfilled to the literal day by Jesus, and the patterns he establishes do not change, I expect that the remaining 3 festivals will fulfill them exactly as well.

       Study this greek word, understand the meaning and use behind it. It is an action verb, sudden, snatching away, catching away, caught up, etc. It is NOT the word used to describe Jesus ascension after His resurrection, this word is much more sudden and FORCEFUL. In short, it is teleportation done through the power of the Spirit. It happened to both Peter and Paul.
       <a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/search/search.cfm?Criteria=%22caught+up%22+G726&amp;amp;t=KJV#s=s_primary_0_1">
        Here are some of the primary uses of it
       </a>
       (there's one missing from this list FYI).
      </p>
      <p>
       Two things to note, the primary rapture verse (
       <strong>
        1 Thes 4:17
       </strong>
       ) is one of the occurences, in addition to
       <strong>
        Revelation 12:5
       </strong>
       . This is a forceful snatching away to protect from the "red dragon" (
       <em>
        which is another topic unto itself...
       </em>
       ) It's the second sign from Revelation 12. We know the first 'great sign' occurs Sept. 23, 2017.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       We are to have hope that we will be sparred from the wrath that is coming upon this world. This is fore-shadowed by events such as:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Just as Lot was in Sodom.
       </li>
       <li>
        Just like Noah and his family was in the Flood.
       </li>
       <li>
        Just like Daniel's three friends in the furnace.
       </li>
       <li>
        Just like the Hebrews were when they were lead out of Egypt on the
        <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation+12:14&amp;amp;version=NASB">
         Wings of an Eagle
        </a>
       </li>
       <li>
        Enoch, the 7th from Adam was raptured to heaven without dying
       </li>
       <li>
        Elijah was raptured to heaven without dying
       </li>
      </ul>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       There are many more obscure passages that at first don't seem to directly relate to it, but as you study them you will begin to see the connections between them. Of the top of my head I can think of these:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Leviticus 12 - the 7 days after giving birth to a male
       </li>
       <li>
        Hebrew wedding traditional customs - the bridegroom would go get the bride and return to his Father's house. There would be a celebration for 7 days
       </li>
       <li>
        Prophetically speaking the 7 days (as confirmed in Daniel by the Angel that gives him the seperation of the 70 weeks) is actually 7 years.
       </li>
       <li>
        The second coming of Christ is not a mystery, we know it occurs at the end of the Tribulation when Jesus comes down onto the Mt. of Olives, splits it in two, and does battle at Armageddon (Mt. Megiddo). Note the rapture ref. in 1 Thes. specifcally points out that Jesus does NOT come back at that event, but rather He meets everyone for the first bodily resurrection IN THE AIR
       </li>
       <li>
        Compare
        <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=isa+26%3A16-21&amp;amp;version=ESV">
         Isaiah 26:16-21
        </a>
        VS
        <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+14%3A1-3&amp;amp;version=ESV">
         John 14:1-3
        </a>
        , note the rooms/mansions we go into until the
        <strong>
         wrath passes
        </strong>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Uggh, there's several more, including the "cannot know the day or hour" explanation (I believe it is a direct nod
       <strong>
        TO
       </strong>
       the Feast of Trumpets) &amp; context that it is said in, but i'm reaching the character limit for this post...

       Pretty much this.

       Some people make a real effort to avoid getting to this conclusion.

      <p>
       For example:
      </p>
      <p>
       Usually a theist argument goes something like this "the probabilities of life as we know to exist and develop in a random events universe is so dim that is virtually impossible, there may be a cause to it"
      </p>
      <p>
       A multiverse counter-argument says "There's an infinite number of universes, so this one happens to be one with the conditions needed to develop life as we know it"
      </p>
      <p>
       So they multiply the problem by an infinite number just to avoid the undesirable conclusion..

       Looks like it too. I don mean this the wrong way, it's his choices, but he is doing things a 14 year old does while trying to be an adult.

       I am pretty sure he is stuck in the world and mentality of a teenager because that's how he has been successful. He could even be a part of the satanic abuse in Hollywood for all I know. Starting to discover a lot of the boy bands and girl solo artists are in some potentially abusive environments. Or just have deep emotional issues stemming from their experiences.  Maybe fame is a drug, he needs a fix, so he is keeping himself important somehow. Until he says something ,I can speculate all day why he isn't.

       My buddy and I have been taking a hard look at bands lately. Lyrics, imagery/videos, what we know of their development. And it is just making me super suspicious that some of the worst rumors about the music industry aren't even close. Something along the lines of MKUltra, we see this weird symbolism everywhere, and the lyrics are screaming abuse. Each bit by itself doesn't look like much, but altogether? I dunno, some weird shit is going on.

       I would follow that hunch. It's a dark path because you know where it leads. You and your friend are brave, bring a light. Heh I went down it a few years ago. Didn't take long to see what I needed.

       It was actually Michael Jackson I looked into briefly. He is a lifetime study, but a few vids and you get the gyst. Mostly Goes back to the Beatles. After ww2 and all the things learned from human study began project monarch to transform culture. Music of course became the number one most influential form of hypnotic programming and indoctrinating youth. They become adults, have kids, indoctrinate them and after a few generations the world forgets who they are. What they know is from music and t..v. It is the black box of mk ultra.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ill stop there and let you discover how record labels became sources to recruit talented musicians to sell their soul. And have the producers music performed by the musicians. And how the producers are luciferian masons. And how doctors are used to keep the artists persona intact. Not all musicians are m.k., though  famous ones all sold their talent to producers for a hit, and the producers are the ones connected to the industry telling them what to create. And the industry is the devil.
      </p>
      <p>
       The symbolism itself is in everything now. You would be hard pressed to find a pop music cover  without eye symbolism. Or without some type of satanic encoding.

       Pretty much. All the biggest sell outs you can fit in one video. They all seem ridiculous. That was so saturated with eye symbolism it's disturbing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Didn't notice too many more encodings except when they show that one guy from maroon 5 in his living room, they showed a glimpse of his couch and a blanket was placed and it had H H. Which is another way they encode Eyes. I I . and if you look they flash a Christ looking guy in the background for a second. Whole thing is creepy as fuck.

       Speedometer on timberlakes car was at thirty mph. I've seen them use speedmeters before in commercials and they are at 33 mph. Posted a few of them to r/subliminal.

       But this is everything we see in entertainment. Masonic symbolism planted. I'm sure I'm missing some other references I don't know even know they are making.

       You are correct on all points. My buddy and I kinda think this was a desecration of Cash's memory. That Cash was against or uncooperative with these people, and this was their little grt back. Wild speculation, but we both got the same impression independently. It's funny I am really a science and logic guy. I was a chemist for 20, and now I do database stuff. But the deeper I go into this stuff, the more I feel like my intuition is the better tool. I'm probably just losing my mind haha!

       I feel the same. Even though cash did play their games and had his own personal demons. The vid definitely doesn't do justice to his memory, the vid itself is more about the anti Christ. It just hit me in that scene of the maroon five guy. When they flashed the eyes or HH's, then the Christ, and he is then shown ignoring the Christ in favor of his altar which was a stereo. Highly symbolic shit when you watch what they are doing. Like you said a desecration. that are all mocking Christ. A desecration of Christ and Cash. Each one of them does some form of Christ pose. Like they are false idols.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bono using the dollar sign in "$inners are Saints" is a direct jab at Cash. The Bono scene is full of capitalist symbolism, but the $ is Cash. Saints is spelled with a snake as the S. I think this scene was meant to Cast Cash in that light as false idol. Or prophet of the industry.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I think cash wrote this song as a warning to Satanists originally, and instead they chose to use it against him when he died. Agree with your guys findings.

       Oh, and hell yea your intuition is better. But you need a balance of logic and intuition to keep from going too far in the hole either way. Don't want to end up a pure numerology and numbers type and all logic and just seeing numbers all day. And you don't want too go too far into symbolism.
      </p>
      <p>
       Good that you notice this though. More than half our country doesn't. Right now people are watching t.v. and being pumped full of this shit and don't notice any of it.  I think we are quite amazing to be this perceptive to see through the programming.

       And There are traps laid all around these guys. That's how I look at it. The more I uncover the more I seem to find. But it's also a trail that leads to them. So I can't help but follow it . Have a good night.

       Very well put. It was literally the connection to the classic blues inspired rock way back in the 60's, to the artistic glam rock of the 70's , to the rebellious punk rock and new wave of the 80's. I grab records from my older relatives and  dive into every aspect of it. People today can only grasp what is right in front of them and currently "popular". It is pathetic. On that note lets enjoy some "system" for those who actually think "outside the box" because as Serg says "Free Thinkers Are Dangerous":

       Fuck yeah dude.  Bands like Soundgarden, Pearl Jam, Nirvana, AIC, etc. really encapsulated everything that was amazing about the eras before them and did it their own way without dumbing down their content for sales.  Nirvana would never have gotten away with a subversive anti-pop album like
       <em>
        In Utero
       </em>
       these days after the popular and cultural shift that
       <em>
        Nevermind
       </em>
       created for the music industry.  People don't realize these days that these bands were literally considered the saviors of music when they came out, just because of how absolutely manufactured and fake the pop drivel and hair metal garbage was before it.  This was authentic, legit music being created by everyday people from garages that somehow made it big, and you're pretty much never going to see anything like it again.  Hard not to agree when people say that the 90s was the last time that rock bands truly mattered on a cultural level.  The early 90s were absolutely incredible when it comes to anti-mainstream music and DIY attitudes becoming widespread.

       DeLonge is an Illuminati front man. He has been chosen and groomed forthis. A hip cool young guy who will be very accepted by the masses. He is a major Freemason and has the freemason symbol on his shoes, clothes and guitars. But no one seems to notice:

       Honestly wouldn't surprise me, but I do recall Tom and Mark being outspoken and vehemently against the younger girls taking their tops off at their shows, to the point of calling it out onstage.  Who knows though, that was also 16+ years ago.

       Travis is a known douchebag IRL, and Tom was a pill popper with a God complex before he quit blink-182 the
       <em>
        first

       time lol.  Mark always struck me as a cool guy, but I've even heard stories where he completely snubbed people, even bands opening for them.  Apparently they are one of those bands who have a policy of 'no eye contact from lesser peons' backstage.

       that unplugged performance is art on the level of munch's the scream and the despair of van gogh. layne displays a vulnerable, tortured genius who delivers honesty and emotion rarely seen. we are in a disposable world of images and deception. i recently met a bunch of neo cons at a party who were blowing nuts talking about fake hero chris kyle. they said to me "so who is a hero?".   i said there are two guys i feel are human heroes Pat Tillman and Layne Staley. needless to say they were beyond confused...

       The government has no obligation to you whatsoever - and in fact has incentive to ever disclose anything to the public.

       It's all far more simple than the average student thinks 'it' is or wants it to be.

       'Astral' has form, but 'truth' is beyond form.
      </p>

       Truth is not a narrative, so take caution when someone is trying to sell you a story. . especially if they're literally trying to sell you something.

       That's just it, this kind of thing isn't easily boiled down in a single article, or even all that effective to talk about online.
      </p>
      <p>
       Going 'astral' isn't a challenge anymore, and it's not just what people have been lead to believe from cinematic storytelling like the article in this post.  Most daydreaming is basically activating astral thought patterns, which is extremely subjective compared to objective human thinking.
      </p>
      <p>
       Too many people are unable to distinguish between the two, and it creates a lot of confusion.
      </p>
      <p>
       Worse, a lot of the alien stuff that talks about factions and hidden wars are a poor attempt at giving a human objective translation to subjective astral information.
      </p>
      <p>
       People who believe articles like this post are in for a big shock.

       That's kind of it, it's dicey to talk about without some kind of solid foundation that reduces miscommunications and slows down the fantasies people are so ready to build for themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm going to use 'healing' as an example because it's one of the few perspectives on this topic that attempts to give you at doing something rather than just reading articles. Disclaimer though, not all systems are equal or even honest (knowingly or not) with what they're teaching.
      </p>
      <p>
       Think of it this way, in North America there are usually three levels in any healing system that deal with a progressive building of a specific skillset.  In asia, there are usually nine. This is pretty common for any openly advertised system or modality, the publicly available information in english usually stops at level three. Why? Because that's where it deals with the dream-like or astral quality of the types of visions and experiences that dovetail into the topic being discussed in this post.
      </p>
      <p>
       This information isn't being withheld by any group with sinister purposes. Some systems will touch on the content of the later levels, but that depends largely on who you are learning from in person. Good teachers don't drop stuff on their students that their students aren't ready for.
      </p>
      <p>
       But take this all with a grain of salt, I'm not exactly a teacher myself.

       Something is afoot for sure. Various factions are making moves, and I feel confident that big things are in the pipeline. The question is, which faction will play their hand first, and what is their agenda?
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm skeptical of VoTL, but I'm willing to hear them out. I don't trust Delonge, however. Maybe his intentions are legit, but he appears to be nothing more than a mouthpiece for the deep state.
      </p>

       Discernment will be crucial over the next year, and I'm happy to see important questions being raised in the OP.

       OP Ive been paying attention to both for some time now too and I tend to think along the same lines as you. Although I do think tom is a little more self aware than ppl might think, I'm sure he's read the Cameron books too! The branding part of the whole thing (to the stars, sekret machines) that he talked about on coast to coast earlier this year was interesting.

       Yeah I hear what you're saying. I listened to that entire interview as well and it left me concerned he was only being given one side of the story you know? He pushes the evil grey alien agenda thing a little too much.

       And he pushes the idea that the deep state people are unsung heroes. I'm sure there are some good people amongst their ranks, but their collective actions across the globe prove they are quite different from the reality that Delonge is trying to paint. This is the biggest red flag to me.

       No doubt the info he would be getting would so vetted and manipulated to Make the ppl giving it look good. I guess I'm at the point of even if we get a bit of real info mixed with in with the bullshit that's a step. Also he seemed to come off really pro military and government which I get if you're trying to butter them up! But at the same time that concerns me. Gonna have to reserve judgement until we hear his whole story though maybe there's a good reason who the fuck knows

        A staged alien invasion will be used to bring in the NWO, a unified global government.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       This is a compilation of
       <strong>
        Ronald Reagan
       </strong>
       saying on three different occasions that an outside threat by aliens would unite the world:
       <a href="https://youtu.be/iQxzWpy7PKg">
        https://youtu.be/iQxzWpy7PKg
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       "...we often forget how much unites all the members of humanity. Perhaps we
       <strong>
        need
       </strong>
       some outside universal threat to make us recognize this common bond. I occasionally think how quickly
       <strong>
        our differences worldwide would vanish
       </strong>
       if we were
       <strong>
        facing an alien threat
       </strong>
       from outside this world." Um, wut?
      </p>
      <p>
       This is a clip of
       <strong>
        Bill Clinton
       </strong>
       regurgitating that same narrative:
       <a href="https://youtu.be/QvcDNrKOlOM?t=2m20s">

      </p>
      <p>
       "...if we were visited someday, I wouldn't be surprised. I just hope that, uh, it's not like 'Independence Day', the movie—that it's a, you know, a conflict. It might be
       <strong>
        the only way to unite this increasing divided world of ours
       </strong>
       . They're out there, we've had our—think of how all
       <strong>
        the differences among people on Earth would seem small
       </strong>
       if we felt
       <strong>
        threatened by a space invader
       </strong>
       . That's the whole theory of 'Independence Day'."
      </p>
      <p>
       So...he hopes that if it happens it's not like "Independence Day"...but at the same time, if it was, it would be good because it would unite the world? Interesting...

       Now consider this: on June 30th,
       <strong>
        Donald Trump

       signed an executive order to revive the
       <strong>
        National Space Council
       </strong>
       , which was last active in 1993.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://youtu.be/TAUqcBc0hYI?t=8m5s">
        He said
       </a>
       , "
       <strong>
        Our journey into space

       Nasa has always been a gatekeeper. "Pioneering" in space exploration and space age tech, but really it's just showboating the best of the technology they allow us to see. This acts as a distraction so they can experiment with reverse engineered alien tech and zero point energy on black budget projects behind the scenes.

       It may be true though. There's no law, save for maritime international law in space, if my vague knowledge of space law from watching Matt Damon in The Martian is correct.

       It's basically going to be a mirror of the 1600s and 1700s. Large private corporations and militaries, space pirates, and colonies being settled. But in space.

       Asteroid mining is going to bring unlimited wealth to the economy, and remove any value from any goods on Earth, via mass inflation. Whether it turns into Star Trek, Star Wars, or Halo is based upon how we handle it.

       I agree with the Tom DeLong "Messiah" analogy... he's kind of come out of nowhere in the last few years to become a big mainstream name on the topic.
      </p>
      <p>
       I listen to a lot of podcasts around UFO's and some big names with 20-30 years of tenure in the field are very suspicious and a little hurt by Tom's rapid rise. I think he won the UFO researcher of the year award recently,  apparently its a pretty prestigious award in that circle. It seems like a result in which a lot of people were scratching their heads as to why him.

       He did receive that award. He's well connected and can bank roll his enthusiasm for it where most UFO researchers aren't so lucky. I think he mentioned when he first met Jacques Valle he got a lot of attitude until he really proved himself to him, and he ended up writing the foreword to one of his books.

       Why is there no evidence for any of this? It's alot of talk and alot of extraordinary claims. Alot of "soon" but nothing ever comes from it. Ever. Considering I was very blue eyed in the beginning of this century but nothing ever happened I have since grown very cynical and bitter. I don't want anymore talk I want proof. I want to see the shit with my own eyes. Talk is cheap. I haven't the energy left for hope. Either it's real and you show me proof or it's just talk.

       It's good fiction.  It's meaningless.  Move forward.  Things happen every day, but you wouldn't hear about it.  Why would you?   If you helped the police catch a murderer in your home town, I wouldn't hear about it.  But justice would have been served.  There is too much focus on too few people.  What can you do to make your life and others around you better?  Focus there and things you can see will change around you.  That is a better alternative to sitting and waiting for a bunch of liars to tell you the truth.  They will only tell you more lies until you either die or stop listening.

       Delonge's Podesta ties are very worrying. I don't like him. I think he's a prick, and in my opinion he has done jack shit for the disclosure movement beyond posturing and rambling.
      </p>
      <p>
       VoTL has provided solid information. Some of their series of tweets have been so good I copied them into a document. The way they have tied everything together is pretty compelling and alongside Bill Cooper's work, a fairly concise picture starts to form...
      </p>
      <p>
       But disclosure has already been happening for a while. Have you not been paying attention? There's been dozens of articles in the mainstream media which have acknowledged things that heretofore were thought of us 'theories'. Recently they announced successfully teleporting photons. I mean, do people not fully 'get it' when they see news like that? They've just told us they can teleport shit. And anyone who has done some research knows they've been able to do that for decades.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's been all sorts of new technologies announced, various disclosures about our surrounding planets, etc. The disclosure process begins with seeding things into human consciousness, which they've been doing for a while - just as Corey Goode said they would. Numerous predictions by Goode about how this process would play out seem to be fairly accurate thus far, and comparing his information alongside what VoTL is doing is very interesting.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've followed VoTL from basically the beginning of the series of tweets. I didn't know about it when the account lay mostly  inactive for a couple of years, or however long it was. But once they started, I tuned in. I have the page pretty much permanently open in my browser so I can stay up to date with their posts. I have felt since I first began watching it, that VoTL was definitely hooked up in some way with Corey Goode. It's the Alliance.
      </p>
      <p>
       I definitely think disclosure is coming. But I also worry that it's still going to lead to the enslavement of humanity. They will weaponize it, to be sure. They will only tell us partial truth. But I think it will get to a point where, once a certain amount has been 'officially' disclosed, the ignorant masses will be trying to find their local tin foil hat wearer to hear the rest of the story.
      </p>
      <p>
       Once they put out disclosures of some information, it will be possible I think to extrapolate from there and work out what other 'theories' are also true, that they haven't disclosed. I'm not sure how they think a partial disclosure will ever work. Once people know some of the truth and that they've been lied to for their entire lives, something's gonna give in the public. Finally they will wake up to certain facts and start questioning everything.

       im not sure enslavement is the right concept, it literally might blow peoples minds into the remission of society. You tell people aliens are real before the birth of the internet it doesnt have as big of an effect, but now? with instant access to any information out there, and it somehow slipped past a few billion people? chaos and panic...

       Depends how it happens. Depends what we're talking about. Are we talking about total take down of the Cabal and all of its tentacles ahead of disclosure by the 'good guys'? Or are we talking about a disclosure event in which the Cabal still have control?
      </p>
      <p>
       I keep seeing rumblings that the Cabal is being taken down, but real evidence of that is nowhere to be seen. The fact that the elite pedophiles in DC are still at large ALL this time later blows my mind. The globalist agendas seem to be continuing to play out as normal, even though there's supposed to be a take-down happening... 
I just see no signs to warrant belief that the Cabal are being defeated as yet.
      </p>
      <p>
       So I'm going to assume if disclosure happens it's still somewhat controlled and you can bet your bottom dollar that those people will only provide disclosure for the purposes of mass enslavement. I've seen many theories that disclosure would coincide with the promulgation of a 'new religion', or the rolling out of the new world order under some peaceful, loving guise...

       There's so many ways this could go. Only time will tell.

       There seems to be some validity to the idea that he's coming into the presidency with some knowledge through his uncle about what Tesla was doing and, presumably, what was done with Tesla's ideas after his death. So this in itself should render him somewhat wanting to unlock what might be a family legacy that nobody has known about, which would be pretty special. If he does live up to his potential -which is not something I ever thought I would say about Donald Trump, I will admit that- then it could be a very good outcome. But there also seems to be some validity to the fact that Jared Kushner is a Zionist and possibly real part of the so-called 'Illuminati'. I mean, if some of the rumblings are real...this is touch and go man. We can be sure of nothing but uncertainty. It's war. It's the battle between good and evil. It means that Trump was right when he said 'this is not just another four year election'. He called it a crossroads in our civilization. (I refer of course

I still get chills when I listen to that speech. Very well edited together, by whoever extracted this from the full speech. Their edits were really masterful and this flows nicely. But it's chilling, because he is SUCH a character. His facial expressions, his hand gestures, and even his tonal use - he really leaps out of it, and when you listen to what he's saying, he's basically vindicating the conspiracy theorists. He's admitting the deep state, the darkness of it, and the fact that something needs to be done. He seems to pose one of the biggest threats it has ever had, and he knew this. They knew this. This explains the persecution of Donald Trump the minute he entered the race. They totally muscled out Bernie Sanders (remember when he announced the nomination he had that fresh gash on his cheek, which he hadn't had the day before?). They thought that had it. They probably rigged it in their favor. And still, Donald. When you look back it's amazing that he won on speeches like this. Because actually more people are waking up all the time. There's a lot who are resistant and locked into cognitive dissonance. But a LOT are waking up. Recent developments seem to suggest the shit is about to hit the fan. Elite child and organ trafficking will be dealt with and some of the major players taken down, perhaps? Who knows. But something's gotta give.

       You must be quite the orator. Nice progressive thought there... to add on, I saw him in person the year in before he won (during his pre election campaign) never seen anything like it. So many people were aware and actually rooting for him in the stadium. Gives me just a bit of hope this species can turn it around.

       I think higher ups in the control structure have been trying to plan how this will come to the public consciousness so that they can remain in control to the greatest extent possible as you mentioned. Perhaps Delonge is their guy for the leaks to bring about this "partial disclosure" narrative. Perhaps the bluebeam plans fell through and due to elements within the power structure exercising their free will and moving to the light. So it seems blue beam has evolved. Perhaps Delonge is part of the evolved controlled narrative, but even he acknowledges that he may be only spoon fed select information due to someone's agenda.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact of the matter is people are waking up and the power structure is wholly dependent on people's belief (or general lack of awareness) that what they are doing is the right thing to do, when in fact it is simply what was planned by those in power. So its possible even a carefully crafted disclosure process is not going according to plan as more and more people become aware of the hidden powers (the bloodlines and aristocratic lines) and their methods of control (levers in the banking, entertainment, media, health, religion and science sectors plus control over secret societies, criminal organizations, and intelligence agencies). This awareness is accelerating the dissolution of the control structures which continues to remove control of the official narratives in ways that undermine the entire power structure.
      </p>
      <p>
       Assuming the trend of people realizing these mechanisms continues, their best bet is to take advantage of impending Earth changes and potential natural disasters to bring out bits of technology to use as a helping hand lending trust while uniting the worlds governments in an effort to mitigate effects of the impending global crises. After this is completed, if left unchecked, it might be possible to gain control over the major portion of the populace through such a unified government via financial and technological control.
      </p>
      <p>
       The issue is enough people have woken up to these control methods that there might be no going back to the state of slumber we were in only a few decades ago. We just have to be wary when the major governments come together to save us with new technology or whatever the case may be. Its possible that Goode, Wilcock, COBRA, VOTL, etc are all part of the "long con" blue beam (perhaps unwittingly) and that the release of these hidden technologies ultimately means enslavement of the human race. This is why its critical that we raise our personal awareness through meditation, self reflection, healthy eating, and spiritual practice so that when the critical moment occurs we are able to discern and ally with those that have our best interests at heart and reject the control of the dark influences. I'm not saying these people are definitely compromised, I'm just saying always read and use discernment - and realize that only through your own actions can you ultimately transcend the problems that plague our current condition.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another thing is to stay positive and visualize a more loving world. Every single person has a huge potential influence on how things play out in this critical time. And remember that things are not black and white; just because it may seem that someone is working for the dark, it could be that they have good intentions and are only being deceived and just a few kind words to them or a few well placed conversations could wake them up to the reality of the situation, severely undermining the dark's plans. The reason the dark has been so successful in controlling the Earth is because most people are mostly selfish, with some unselfish parts in them, which allow the truly selfish to manipulate the population more easily. However, as this majority of the population (who ultimately have good intentions and believe in humanity) becomes more aware of the virtue of helping others, the minority of those that are completely turned to evil will find the populace more and more difficult to control. You positive actions have an echo effect and will transmit throughout the population.

       ive noticed a change in people the last few years. so dark, so negative and stress filled. Technology is literally driving people to have anxiety 24/7, sleep anxiety, wake up anxiety, have children anxiety, go to work anxiety, be single anxiety, sexual anxiety...
      </p>

       Everything we do is monitored and has consequences people feel this pressure and the human mind isnt designed to be manipulated by stressors outside of actual "flight or flight" survival moments.

       I think alot of that is due to the increasing toxicity in our environment (food, water, air) and the increasing electromagnetic pollution all around us (wifi, cellular networks, HVAC, "smart meters"). It is possible to protect yourself from these effects by filtering your water, eating organic local produce, turning off devices when they aren't needed, turning off your wifi at night, etc while continuously healing yourself via internal energy techniques. These include meditation, yoga, tai-chi, chi-kung (or qi-gong), and others.
      </p>
      <p>
       Few people do the work to reduce the toxins in their environment because they don't see the causal relationship between their consumption and daily activities and the stressors in their life. Even fewer people realize you can actively maintain health and vitality using internal energy practice because most people don't realize you can consciously manipulate your autonomic nervous system with regular practice - allowing the electromagnetic fields in your body to establish a resonance with the electromagnetic field of the Earth and beyond.

       Well said.  All of it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, this will sound crazy: This is the Great War between God (the creator) and the Devil (the created,) and other fallen angels.  We are all waking up everyday in a war zone.  You just don't know it.  The Devil(s) occupy bodies/minds and play out complex narratives that deceive and intend to drive their targets to insanity.  Men, prayed upon like this, have taken up and joined with them in all different roles of government, the private sector, and underground.  The fallen angels have telepathic abilities, and with so much technology it is easy to hide the ability.  Over the centuries, through extortion, theft, murder, blackmail, war, terrorist attacks, and any other means necessary they have complete control of the monetary system.  The signs and symbolism over the centuries has remained relatively constant because the enemy has been constant.  Their god is money because it allows them to control/trick men.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you believe what I said, you might feel despair.  But don't lose hope! The Devil has already lost and that is why they are so mad.  This is their prison (for now,) and they have gone centuries without a fair fight.  There is balance here now.

       Look at Tom DeLong's square and compass symbol on his guitar. There are pictures of him wearing the masonic apron with fellow masons. He is a stonemason. The guy used to be anti military industrial complex as a young man. Now he is saying the government is the good guy and their nuclear stockpile is to protect us from aliens. Weird... The strange thing is he does have serious connections. But he is also cashing in on all of this with his company. But still others like Cameron have said he has info, though he is being guided. Big names like Smith and Vallee are connected.
      </p>
      <p>
       Weird things are happening. Weird things are happening in the pedogate investigation. This stuff is real. SRA is real. Strange and evil things are afoot. These beings are spiritual. Funny because Vallee discusses how Alien phenomenon is not just "physical", but even more than that. He might say trans-dimensional. You take this with things like bluebeam, and the warnings of scriptures of the great apostasy and signs that could fool even possibly the very elect. We are living in a weird time. Something is happening. I think Jesus is coming soon. Before he comes though, very awful, powerful, and terrifying things are going to occur. Dark things are bubbling up.
      </p>
      <p>
       Really guys, please listen to the words of Jesus. Pray to him. He did die on the cross for the sins of the world, and is our only hope. From everything I have ever learned of the "high strange", I can say that it is leading to a climax. We are fighting against principalities and powers.

       Remember the words of Jesus. He warned us that many would come in his name. When Jesus comes, the faithful will know. I just pray that I receive the grace to see. When he comes all will see, and it will be very clear. I do agree though that there are going to be events so spectacular that even the very elect may be deceived.

       I have wondered about an alien disclosure event for some time now..
      </p>
      <p>
       With the satanic holidays and rituals, with the messy and suspicious suicides of 2 big names in Hollywood and their connections to pedophilia and child sex trafficking... with September 23 being 33 days away from the Bohemian Satanic meeting...
      </p>
      <p>
       I feel like it is coming this year. I've always felt like we were being subconsiously programmed to soften the blow of extra-terrestrial life being introduced to us - just because of all of the media and television and pop culture..
      </p>
      <p>
       What if they are finally ready and they believe that our consciousness has reached the point of being able to process such an event?

        Fine. One more. He's been pardoned because he's elbow deep w/ Clinton's, Obama and both "establishment" parties. He ran a lot of back door channels w/ lots of missing money to account for (personal money too) that he'd never avoid serving time for, if ever investigated. He was trapped a long time ago, many, against his will. His vengeance has been earned and his pardon is retribution to decades of corruption. Trump was VERY CAREFUL who he selected to pull from the Obama trenches.

        Mueller being the one to bring this home is the absolute best retaliatory ass fuck to the establishment. I will also say this, it's intended as a sign and smoke signal for those in the establishment, still unwillingly riding the coat tails of McCain, Pelosi, Graham, Schumer, etc. because they're living in fear. Mueller proves Trump know who the real criminals are. You're going to watch congress unite and really behind Teump with the establishment's collapse because they will see the swamp can't threaten them or blackmail anymore. I really can't say anything else. Just have faith.

       You say you have followed VoTL since the beginning. Have you read all 6,000+ of his tweets? I tried to read some but his tweets are too absurd and sound like the ravings of madman or someone on drugs. I'm open minded but a lot of the things he tweets is too far at the deep end of the pool of believably.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, there are some elements of his tweets that made me think of "Commander Z" (
       <a href="https://twitter.com/timewave666">
        https://twitter.com/timewave666

       ). The problem I have with these people is the really weird claims they're making

      <ul>
       <li>
        evil aliens trying to take over governments/Earth
       </li>
       <li>
        VoTL calls these aliens "Ashkenazi/fake Jews" who did the holocaust, hijacked Judaism and is trying to rule the world
       </li>
       <li>
        lunar moon bases already operational
       </li>
       <li>
        VoTL says one lunar base was destroyed by the Soviets in 1979
       </li>
       <li>
        the aliens are cloning world leaders (takes a few years)
       </li>
       <li>
        aliens possess those cloned bodies
       </li>
       <li>
        blood oath / selling of human souls (something about 3rd and 4th dimensions)
       </li>
      </ul>

       I guess they would argue they throw in some absurdities to throw people off. In that case, what is their true messages weaved within the absurd messages? They keep pushing the idea that August to November 2017 is when there will be a noticeable financial event with the stock market and banks failing, that high government officials will start taking leave by October 2017, I think both had stated their dislike of Trump even calling him a traitor.
      </p>
      <p>
       The message is pretty much fear mongering and LARPing. At this point I pretty much don't believe in the alien story anymore.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look up
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_M._Greer">
        Steven Greer
       </a>
       , the "Disclosure Project" started in 1993. It's been 24 years with nothing to show for it. And now we are to believe aliens are going to reveal themselves again? Their work only further pushes people into disbelieving it.

       Surely it does. At least our reality seen through the lens of media, entertainment, and politics. A house of tarot cards built on deception.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most the truth is hidden within media. Or it's mentioned. Part of the delusion is not even seeing what is before our eyes. Accepting it as normal. That's when we get lazy and the creeps lurking around every corner to correct you appear.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm less fearful of an alien invasion than I am the government who hides that 'their heeeere' in my movies growing up ,while never officially acknowledging they were here , themselves. And you don't know when you are 6 years old the cia is working with Hollywood to cast spells over the nation. You don't find that out till all the narratives have already been programmed by the media into our minds. If you start to scratch the surface.

       Fuck yeah dude.  Bands like Soundgarden, Pearl Jam, Nirvana, AIC, etc. really encapsulated everything that was amazing about the eras before them and did it their own way without dumbing down their content for sales.  Nirvana would never have gotten away with a subversive anti-pop album like
       <em>
        In Utero
       </em>
       these days after the popular and cultural shift that
       <em>
        Nevermind
       </em>
       created for the music industry.  People don't realize these days that these bands were literally considered the saviors of music when they came out, just because of how absolutely manufactured and fake the pop drivel and hair metal garbage was before it.  This was authentic, legit music being created by everyday people from garages that somehow made it big, and you're pretty much never going to see anything like it again.  Hard not to agree when people say that the 90s was the last time that rock bands truly mattered on a cultural level.  The early 90s were absolutely incredible when it comes to anti-mainstream music and DIY attitudes becoming widespread.

       that unplugged performance is art on the level of munch's the scream and the despair of van gogh. layne displays a vulnerable, tortured genius who delivers honesty and emotion rarely seen. we are in a disposable world of images and deception. i recently met a bunch of neo cons at a party who were blowing nuts talking about fake hero chris kyle. they said to me "so who is a hero?".   i said there are two guys i feel are human heroes Pat Tillman and Layne Staley. needless to say they were beyond confused...

       That's kind of it, it's dicey to talk about without some kind of solid foundation that reduces miscommunications and slows down the fantasies people are so ready to build for themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm going to use 'healing' as an example because it's one of the few perspectives on this topic that attempts to give you at doing something rather than just reading articles. Disclaimer though, not all systems are equal or even honest (knowingly or not) with what they're teaching.
      </p>
      <p>
       Think of it this way, in North America there are usually three levels in any healing system that deal with a progressive building of a specific skillset.  In asia, there are usually nine. This is pretty common for any openly advertised system or modality, the publicly available information in english usually stops at level three. Why? Because that's where it deals with the dream-like or astral quality of the types of visions and experiences that dovetail into the topic being discussed in this post.
      </p>
      <p>
       This information isn't being withheld by any group with sinister purposes. Some systems will touch on the content of the later levels, but that depends largely on who you are learning from in person. Good teachers don't drop stuff on their students that their students aren't ready for.
      </p>
      <p>
       But take this all with a grain of salt, I'm not exactly a teacher myself.
