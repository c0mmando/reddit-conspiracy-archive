<p>1,000 paid Russians spread fake news during election</p>

<p>￼</p>

<p>Marcus Gilmer</p>

<p>Mar 31st 2017 10:57AM</p>

<p>￼￼</p>

<p>If it seems like your family members living in key swing states were more swept up in anti-Hillary Clinton fake news than others during the 2016 election, Russian trolls may have been involved.</p>

<p>SEE ALSO: How computer hacking is becoming Russia&#39;s weapon of choice</p>

<p>According to two members of the Senate Intelligence Committee, Sen. Mark Warner (D-VA) and committee chairman Richard Burr (R-NC), hundreds of Russian trolls were paid in 2016 to generate fake news stories about Clinton and target them at voters in key states in an effort to swing the election for Trump.</p>

<p>&quot;There were upwards of a thousand paid internet trolls working out of a facility in Russia, in effect taking over a series of computers which are then called a botnet, that can then generate news down to specific areas,&quot; Warner said.</p>

<p>While he indicated investigators were still trying to figure out exactly what places the trolls were targeting, Warner mentioned they were exploring possible targeting of three states that helped swing the election for Donald Trump: Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin.</p>

<p>Those three states were later the subject of a failed recount attempt by Green Party candidate Jill Stein.</p>

<p>And, the senators warned, the Russians aren&#39;t done. Burr said that it looks like the Russians are being much more overt than they were in 2016 in their attempts to affect the outcome of key elections in Germany and France.</p>

<p>&quot;We feel part of our responsibility,&quot; Burr said, &quot;is to educate the rest of the world.&quot;</p>

<p>Not surprisingly, Germany has signed on for a new Facebook effort to tag fake news on the social media site, a feature that&#39;s recently rolled out in the U.S. after the platform faced heavy criticism for the proliferation of fake news throughout the election.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t take it personally kiddo but President Trump is not the one to blame.  Democrats killed the party themselves.  You pissed off a lot of people when you fucked over Bernie.  Nobody even donates to the Democratic party anymore.  People don&#39;t identify as Democrats anymore.  The writing is on the wall.  All this capitulating and whining is what it looks like when a party is in it&#39;s death throes.  2 SCOOPS!  History will not remember you kindly.</p>

<p>While I was a democrat (before quitting the party), I became dismayed to see the messages coming out of my party, crafted by loathsome David Brock - those were not <em>my messages</em> as a lefty.</p>

<p>If you like David Brock speaking for you, have at it.  As long as he&#39;s the mouthpiece for the party, I&#39;ll find myself a third party.  Thanks.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If I had the choice, we&#39;d have Bernie Sanders running things.</p>

<p>That being said, I do believe that third-party voters and people who didn&#39;t vote are partly at fault for Trump being in power. There are a whole host of factors that lead to this situation, and David Brock and other neo-liberals (is that the word?) are certainly partly to blame. </p>

<p>My objective is that list I provided earlier. We can accomplish most of that with the current dems in power. I&#39;d much rather have that than what I&#39;m watching happen under Trump. Literally everything in that list is at risk right now, and much if it is already under attack.</p>

<p>You can say you&#39;re not at fault all you want, it doesn&#39;t change what&#39;s happening to healthcare, the EPA, net neutrality, LGBT rights, to marijuana legalization, to the private prison industry, and to a host of other things. It feels good to feel like you&#39;re fighting the good fight, but the cost isn&#39;t worth it to me.</p>

<p>That&#39;s the phrase that caught my eye.  I might be a little hair-trigger about this particular charge, because it&#39;s been made against those of us who didn&#39;t vote for HRC over and over again.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No worries. I totally get why people didn&#39;t vote for HRC, especially liberals. Part of voting in protest is that you&#39;re saying you&#39;d rather risk even worse repercussions than vote for someone you see as corrupt. I don&#39;t agree with that, but I understand why people do it. It&#39;s game theory and, to me, the risk is too high right now.

<p>I understand why you wouldn&#39;t agree with that.  I don&#39;t really like the logic myself.  It was a horrible dilemma for many of us, and every time Trump does something awful, it&#39;s particularly painful for me. </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Yes.  But just so you know, many of us used to subscribe to the &quot;lesser&quot; argument for many <em>many</em> elections.  It was my crede in fact, and I chastised friends and family members who voted for Nader back in the day.  So I completely understand your position.</p>

<p>It&#39;s just that there comes a point when the lesser evil, is just too evil.</p>

<p>And that&#39;s the problem with corruption.  It&#39;s a great equalizer.  A corrupt democratic party really isn&#39;t that much better than a corrupt republican party.  </p>

<p>Corruption destroys trust in governance, and when that trust goes, so does our social contract.</p>

<p>Just a quick find. I&#39;d say a million dollars in funding would pay more than two people.</p>

<p>There&#39;s plenty of evidence when you&#39;re done speculating to make yourself feel validated. &quot;They just think people who disagree with them are shills.&quot;</p>

<p>No, there are plenty of sane liberals who hold a reasonable debate.</p>

<p>Then there&#39;s shills.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know how anyone can deny that these days. You have to be blatantly ignorant to the facts or, well...</p>

<p>Don&#39;t worry, I assume you&#39;re just blatantly ignorant to the facts. Happy to help with some enlightenment.</p>

<p>In the face of direct evidence of shills and specifically David Brock&#39;s interest in it, your qualm is that I didn&#39;t find more than a million dollars of funding in one link?</p>

<p>I&#39;d say my one link is quite literally a million dollars worth of proof. You can&#39;t say it&#39;s some small time group with no real influence anymore, so you&#39;ve switched your line of reasoning entirely.</p>

<p>&quot;B-b-but that&#39;s not enough proof for me!&quot; </p>

<p>It&#39;s better than your complete and utter speculation, lol.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll be interested to see your next response. I don&#39;t find it likely that you&#39;ll stay in the same line of reasoning, but I certainly find it likely that you&#39;ll try to discredit me or the source somehow.</p>

<p>If you actually are here for a reasonable debate, what makes you think your two man crew is at all likely after seeing direct evidence of a million dollars being sunk into this project? It&#39;s not like I had to search and search for that link. It came right up. I&#39;m sure I can find plenty more proof of you prove to be worth debating.</p>

<p>Any evidence they only pay $10/hr with no benefits or profit margin or cost of equipment that they woult still pay for even if they had it already? Nope. You’re just making things up from complete and utter speculation. Cool. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, a super PAC worried about a profit margin. Ha! </p>

<p>I actually gave them some wiggle room on pricing. I figure they probably pay minimum wage to people who already support their views. Possibly even people who are already working for their companies, making a real salary, and being paid bonuses to shill.</p>

<p>And yes, I am speculating based on the evidence available. You are speculating based on what you want to be true. &quot;All you have is $1 million dollars from over a year ago.&quot; All you have is a  <em>feeling</em>  that they&#39;re not real. </p>

<p>I&#39;d say I have more evidence than you do.</p>

<p>And no one equated your dissent to shilling. I equated your dissent with you being someone who is so ingrained in their beliefs that they won&#39;t end up having a reasonable debate. </p>

<p>That seems to hold true so far. &quot;Your evidence isn&#39;t evidence enough! Didn&#39;t you see how I supported my claims with no evidence?! Obviously I&#39;m right!!!&quot;</p>

<p>Then you switch to, &quot;well, you&#39;re definitely wrong. You didn&#39;t provide ENOUGH evidence.&quot;</p>

<p>Sounds like projection to me.</p>

<p>I guarantee that we wouldn&#39;t be having this discussion if I provided the vaguest of proof of shills from the other side of the political spectrum.</p>

<p>Or do you think that&#39;s a small time, no influence operation as well? That would be truly surprising.</p>

<p>You&#39;re probably not used to someone pointing out your shit arguments, but they are most certainly shit.</p>

<p>Not to mention predictable as fuck! Lol.</p>

<p>Am I a Nazi yet?</p>

<p>I love the irony of your &quot;content&quot; jab.</p>

<p>How am I supposed to respond to statements that are literally devoid of content?</p>

<p>And which of my arguments are based solely in emotion, again?</p>

<p>You&#39;re standing by something that was invented by your emotions. I&#39;ve used logic and evidence to dispute it.</p>

<p>You cling to your guns, emotionally. With zero content.</p>

<p>Spin it how you&#39;d like, your argument is shit, and you&#39;re predictable as fuck.</p>

<p>Most actual progressives, including Bernie himself, are working to push Democrats in a more progressive direction rather than just completely shitting on the party. There is the Congressional Progressive Caucus, they&#39;re opposed to the Blue Dogs, and they&#39;ve been actively fighting for more control over Democrats and the DNC for more than a decade.</p>

<p>You shouldn&#39;t be.  Most Bernie supporters hate the democrats as much as we hate the republicans.  The reason that we dismiss this Russia nonsense is because it&#39;s obvious that it&#39;s a nothingburger.  When all is said and done, the closest to &quot;collusion&quot; or anything else &quot;wrong&quot; will be Trump&#39;s dumb joke he made at a rally asking the Russians to find Hillary&#39;s missing emails.  We dismiss it because it&#39;s nothing--but even if Trump would get impeached (which he won&#39;t) that would just mean President Pence, which would be much worse.  So unless the democrats drop this Russia crap and start talking about the economy Trump will have no problem with reelection.  </p>

<p>Who gives a shit?  I guarantee that Trump officials met with lobbyists for dozens of foreign governments.  Big deal.  Russia didn&#39;t change any votes and unless someone can prove that, this whole thing is a nothingburger.  Nobody gives a shit about Russia, and unless the democrats can figure that out then 2018 will be a bloodbath and Trump will have no problem with reelection.  The republicans already have fewer seats to defend in 2018 so the dems have an uphill battle no matter what, but if they&#39;re still hysterical about Russia next year at this time then November 2018 will be just as depressing as November 2016 for them.</p>

<p>If you think that Shareblue/CTR are the progressive wing of the party then you and I have VERY different definitions of the word.  They&#39;re nothing but the leftovers of the DLC with a few new faces trying to push the same centrist, neoliberal crap that&#39;s lost the democratic party over a thousand seats nationwide over the past decade.  If they&#39;re not economically progressive then I don&#39;t care how socially progressive they are, they&#39;re even more harmful and damaging than republicans.  At least with the republicans in charge the centrists and Shareblue/CTR types will be fighting along with us, but when Obama was in office they were telling progressives to shut up about our complaints.</p>

<p>And there is no Russian scandal!  Nothing!  People talked to people, shit was said, nothing happened, and Trump won a surprise victory.  Unless hackers from the Russian government hacked voting machines in the Rust Belt to delete Hillary votes or create Trump votes this is a non-story.  That didn&#39;t happen, so this is a non-story.  Nothing but sour grapes from a bunch of poor losers.  This is the democrat&#39;s Benghazi.</p>

<p>Nice straw man. I was very clear about what I consider to be the progressive wing of the party. Moreover, even centrist Democrats propose higher minimum wages, better access to college, improved primary education, consumer protections of the sort offered by the CPFB, improved access to healthcare, and infrastructure investment in green transportation and green energy as a means to produce domestic jobs and help revitalize our economy. Blue dogs tend to be corporate whores in the vein of Leiberman and Dodd, I&#39;ll agree with that, but the idea that we&#39;re better off with Trump than Clinton in terms of achieving progressive goals strikes me as naive, at best. It really just sounds like concern trolling; progressives aren&#39;t like hard-right conservatives, they have policy ideas that resonate with the American people that they can fight for, so they aren&#39;t served by being an opposition party dedicated to destroying the federal government.</p>

<p>As for your shrill insistence that there&#39;s no Russian scandal, even a lot of Republicans disagree with you. You&#39;re not even taking a wait-and-see stance with regards to Mueller&#39;s investigation, you&#39;re actually going farther than most Republicans and aligning yourself firmly with the Trump camp.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not my primary concern, but when over half of the politics sub is Russia-related every single day it gets tiring...especially since there&#39;s absolutely no evidence of anything and &quot;the resistance&quot; doesn&#39;t even know what they want.  Trump&#39;s actions prove that he&#39;s an idiot who talks a lot of shit, but nobody should be surprised by that.  But just because he&#39;s a shit-talking idiot doesn&#39;t mean that I&#39;m going to roll over and accept centrist pieces of shit like Corey Booker or Kamilla Harris in 2020.  If the democratic party doesn&#39;t go to the left on economic policy then they&#39;ll keep on losing.  They think that identity politics and changing U.S. demographics will allow them to be a republican party that&#39;s nice to women, gays, and minorities, but the democrats still need the white working class to win national elections, and since their &quot;we&#39;ll win two republicans in the suburbs for every blue collar democrat we lose&quot; has been proven to be a failure they need to change their economic policies.  Pissing their pants about Russia won&#39;t win them any new voters and will only turn off people who&#39;ve supported them in the past.  It&#39;s like someone once said, &quot;it&#39;s the economy, stupid.&quot;</p>

<p>Because there IS no evidence.  And I&#39;m not using any right-wing talking points, I&#39;m using the truth.  The democrats think that they can be a centrist, republican-lite party that&#39;s nice to women, gays, and minorities and that they&#39;ll somehow keep the entire democratic base as well as pick up centrist republicans, but that&#39;s a losing strategy.

<p>What do you make of Russia&#39;s trolls, and their expansive global misinformation campaign, which would eclipse anything Brock could ever achieve? Or how about Cambridge Analytica, which uses the details of out online persona to target and manipulate us? Or how about the the influence of the CIA and NSA? </p>

<p>I&#39;m all for criticism of the manipulating partisan forces online, but the issue with this CTR shit is that it is almost entirely fuelled by partisanship; not by a shared need for an open and fair internet.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hmmm, fair enough.</p>

<p>But I can&#39;t help but feel his potency as a icon isn&#39;t due to his actual presence online, but is primarily due to partisan hype, emanating primarily from neo-reactionaries.</p>

<p>Surely foreign superpowers/ex-superpowers like Russia using thousands of people to astroturf and suppress discussion every day across our media is significantly more worrying than David Brock and his little team?</p>

<p>As much as he represents something terrible, The Kremlins control over the narrative is undeniably worse&#39; especially when they represent the interests of a dictator. Furthermore, it sets a precedent. Any nation can hire people to sit online all day astro-turfing the shit out of our public spaces. It&#39;s chump change when considering the military budgets of most countries; and is probably the future of social media.</p>

<p>I think we&#39;re focusing on the wrong things here, and for all the wrong reasons.</p>

There are no credible facts to back up any of the claims about Trump having relationships with the Russian boogeyman.

<p>The US military complex deep state want WAR with Russia. That&#39;s what the whole bullshit in Syria is/was for. It&#39;s why Iran continues to be used as a boogeyman too. The powers that be want a massive depopulation and wwiii with Russia would be how they could do that.</p>

<p>Correction: June 29, 2017</p>

<p>A White House Memo article on Monday about President Trump’s deflections and denials about Russia referred incorrectly to the source of an intelligence assessment that said Russia orchestrated hacking attacks during last year’s presidential election. The assessment was made by four intelligence agencies — the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, the Central Intelligence Agency, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the National Security Agency. The assessment was not approved by all 17 organizations in the American intelligence community.</p>

<p>That&#39;s your opinion. I see it as we are discussing the biggest astroturfing company in existence. You choose to see it as we are bashing democrats. (probably because you&#39;re offended, because you&#39;re a democrat)</p>

<p>CTR was a PAC that was shut down in 2016 after the electino was over, although of course the people who formed it are still operating in politics. It&#39;s still a convenient scapegoat for people around here, though.</p>

<p>Facts are inconvenient things.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s actually not a bad idea. I think a bit of motivation would help. </p>

<p>I have to assume almost all shills feel that they aren&#39;t really doing that much damage. We could show them that they are one piece in a gigantic web of disinformation and propaganda <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/shills/comments/4kdq7n/astroturfing_information_megathread_revision_8/?st=j5grtzyb&amp;amp;sh=b3565e5d">(see here for all proven cases of shilling</a>), and that by exposing their operation, it would help to get the word out so that regular people can develop a bit of skepticism for what they read online. As it stands right now, there are still people who will upvote bullshit claims as long as the user seems confident. A shill could just provide a shitty source. If you ask for a good source, they could just say &quot;why are you so lazy? Do you google?&quot; </p>

<p>Most people don&#39;t realize the scale of this. There are so many shilling organizations out there, and you&#39;ll probably have to at least  triple the number of ones we know about to get a close estimate of the actual number. </p>

<p>People generally think of social media as just a place where people can complain or shitpost, but it&#39;s actually just the 21st century version of television with commercials, except we don&#39;t know what the real content is and what&#39;s paid for. </p>

<p>An Oxford research paper on astroturfing:</p>

<p><a href="http://comprop.oii.ox.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/89/2017/07/Troops-Trolls-and-Troublemakers.pdf">Troops, Trolls and Troublemakers: A Global Inventory of Organized Social Media Manipulation</a></p>

<p>From this Oxford research paper on astroturfing:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There is no doubt that individual social media users can spread hate speech, troll other users, or set up automated political communication campaigns. Unfortunately, this is also an organized phenomenon, with major governments and political parties dedicating significant resources towards the use of social media for public opinion manipulation.</p>

<p>... In many countries, political actors have no reported ability to field social media campaigns. In some countries, one or two known political actors occasionally use social media for political messaging, and in a few other countries there are multiple government agencies, political parties, or civil society groups organizing trolling and fake news campaigns.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s crazy. Even during the election, most people on here who supported Clinton knew she was a flawed candidate, but were stuck voting for her because she was the better of two evils. Do these people that call anyone they disagree with blue shills not remember the flood of Sanders posts during the primary? That certainly wasn&#39;t because of Democrat shills. This website leans a lot farther left than the general population. I&#39;m of the belief that they are just trying to gaslight users.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Eh, I&#39;m a Sanders&#39; supporter, and there definitely was a weird switch right before the California primary. Before that Reddit was very pro Sanders, anti Hillary, and anti Trump (with pro Trump pockets, including some on this sub).

    <div class="md"><p>Well the primary was pretty much over by that point. That sounds like people were just jumping on the Hillary train after it was obvious she was going to be the candidate.

    <div class="md"><p>The weird thing is, Reddit used to be representative of the people I know. Like I have a lot of friends who are Bernie fans, a few that like Trump, but barely any that like Hillary. Despite what Redditor&#39;s keep saying, this did not change suddenly. Even people I know who &quot;held their nose&quot; and voted for Hillary do not ardently defend her like you now commonly see on Reddit. (See <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> and even here now, which is really really odd) The site went from a representative of my social circle to something entirely different overnight. I mean, it went from NebraskaGunOwner&#39;s posts being top of politics to getting -5000 downvoted if you even question Hillary.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Honestly I think people just see what a trump administration looks like and are missing the days when they thought Hillary would be the worst thing ever. And while you do see people defending her here, it&#39;s mostly against accusations of murder and treason of the highest degree. I think most people wouldn&#39;t argue she was in businesses pocket, but when you argue she was the literal devil while ignoring anything trump is doing, people are going to get defensive. </p>

<p>Also, it must be the circles you run in. Because while I knew a few Bernie fans in college, my family were mostly Hillary fans, and the few Republicans I knew were mostly tolerating trump.</p>

<p>Now, every once in a while, some post stuff from t_d, or Trump related, that aren&#39;t related to conspiracies and I find them annoying too, but they don&#39;t get much traction, so does propaganda &quot;Muh Russia&quot; articles too posted here regularly.

<p>That&#39;s literally the inverse of what I have say when people accuse me or every other left leaning person under the sun of being a shill. There probably is vote manipulation and bots and maybe even shills, but the vast majority of commentators on this and most other subs are exactly who they seem.

<p>Yes Shareblue and CTR are things. Yes they involve SEO, PR Firms and probably buy upvotes here on reddit.

Yes, maybe part of the PR campaign includes buying up votes but I don&#39;t think it is as common and widespread as some users would like to believe.

<p>Whats more scary to me is in descusions about something that you would think all redditors support like Net Neutrality there is an opposition that seems to have lost all grasp on logic and simply just opposes NN based on blatant disinformation. I think the Trumpet twisting of logic is no where near as &quot;organic&quot; as some people want to think.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Eh, there really isn&#39;t that much work you have to do in order to get hundreds of thousands of eyeballs on a few posts and comments. If they only concentrate on the top 100 posts on <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a>, which is where a huge percentage of Reddit traffic is, there might be 2 or 3 political threads worth posting in, then they can set the &quot;upvoter&quot; and leave. That would take like 1 hour of work for 1 person to write out 3 well-thought out comments. That&#39;s one man hour for propaganda that will be read by millions of people. What about all of the other hours this person is working? What about all of the other people who are hired by the same firm? The thing people don&#39;t realize is the power of paid upvotes. You force your comments or posts to the top. </p>

<p>Remember that a tiny percentage of people upvote or downvote. Links on <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a> routinely get 500,000 to a million views a piece. Reddit is one of the most highly trafficked sites in the US. It&#39;s in the top 10. So if they manipulate <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a> a few times a week for a year, they will get all of the people who brose reddit every day, those who browse a few times a week, and those who browse a few times a month. One website says Reddit has a total of a billion separate users each month, but let&#39;s conservatively say it&#39;s 200 million globally because you have to subtract the bots. It&#39;s also extremely easy to manipulate Reddit, and a pre-aged high-karma account is like 60 bucks. Hopefully you see why various firms target Reddit. </p>

<p>Now, what is this person who spent 1 hour going to do for the rest of the workday? Eventually, they might end up on the top post in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>. If there really aren&#39;t any better threads currently on Reddit, there is nothing stopping them from coming here. Even if 80 percent of the CTR/Shareblue shills are on Facebook, and 10 percent on Twitter, all they need is like 3 people to control the largest political threads that are currently on Reddit. 3 people with the power to manipulate votes can be extremely effective.  </p>

<p>Now think about all of the other shilling organizations out there, on both sides of the political spectrum. <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/shills/comments/4kdq7n/astroturfing_information_megathread_revision_8/?st=j5grtzyb&amp;amp;sh=b3565e5d">There are tons of them</a>. Each of them will have different priorities and different tactics. The more shilling firms that exist, the more likely you will read paid-for comments and posts. It seems like a lot of people believe there are only 1 or 2 shilling firms, which causes them to doubt that they read material posted by them. In reality, anyone who browses <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a> probably sees paid-for content <em>every single day.</em></p>

    <div class="md"><p>But you are ignoring the actual users who post content, comment and vote.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not really a stretch that Trump is blasted all over reddit because, well, he says and does some crazy shit. The POTUS is normally newsworthy but since this POTUS is batshit insane he gets a lot more coverage.</p>

<p>On top of that you have the actual progressive grassroots movements that are trying to make sure people are informed. This is where the real work of CTR and ShareBlue come in by collecting and distributing information across social networks like facebook. CTR doesn&#39;t need &quot;shills&quot; to push this narrative. The people are already doing it on their own.</p>

<p>Meanwhile on the opposite end you have groups like Cambridge Analytica that need to keep the supporters they do have on message. Hence the idiotic anti NN stance that Trumpets have adopted. If SB and CTR were as powerful as some people claim then why is it that the liberal side of Reddit still effectively opposes the views that aren&#39;t held by the establishment left (Like single payer healthcare) ? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I understand that real users post stuff on Reddit. I never claimed there weren&#39;t real users. However, real users only get a single vote.

They also know way more about how Reddit works than the average person, so their comments and posts get more hits. </p>

<p>I also find it funny that you don&#39;t think CTR posts on Reddit, despite them specifically naming Reddit as a target in their press release. Cambridge Analytica does political ads on Facebook, at least as far as we know. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve seen this talking point quite a bit. If it was true, then it also applies to pro-Trump posts on Reddit. Anyone who thinks otherwise doesn&#39;t know how subreddits work. Anything can get upvotes as long as it&#39;s posted to the right community. A pro-Trump shitpost will skyrocket in T_D and sink in <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a>. </p>

<p>If you are claiming that pro-Trump posts shouldn&#39;t be upvoted in this sub, I also disagree with you. The conspiracy community has always backed politicians, particularly ones that they believe are &quot;anti-deep state&quot; or something like that. Ron Paul, Rand Paul, Bernie Sanders, Trey Gowdy, etc etc. Trump has marketed himself as anti-establishment, therefore many conspiracy theorists will believe he is. It doesn&#39;t matter if he is or isn&#39;t, conspiracy theorists will back him because that&#39;s what they believe.</p>

<p>I used to think the same thing, but look what happened to the liberals on the Trans Pacific Partnership. As soon as Trump said he was against it, suddenly scores of liberals all over this site changed their opinion. Before that, being pro-TPP would usually mean you were buried in downvotes. </p>

<p>There is a huge percentage of people out there who are stuck on one side of the political spectrum, and many of them will flip flop for the dumbest reasons. </p>

<p>That&#39;s why my point was that reddit isn&#39;t the biggest target for these operations. Reddit is great for users circlejerking and repeating what they &quot;found out&quot; elsewhere. That&#39;s what has been so interesting about these Trump supporters. They all seem to be so willing to turn and shoot themselves in the foot repeating whatever bullshit they were fed. Look at the way they support someone in the administration and then turn around with their teeth out as soon as that person is out of favor.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sure part of it is this &quot;I win no matter what&quot; sports mentality that these people have adopted but it also seems to be something else. It&#39;s just so plainly clear with the NN debate.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>You mean where people said, &quot;good I don&#39;t like Trump but I&#39;m glad TPP is dead.&quot; Yes there were some anti-trump circle-jerking about it but the mood on Reddit was overwhelmingly congratulatory.</p>

<p>You can&#39;t blame all the negativity against Trump as the result of two small (compared to CA) campaigns. You have to think about your demographic on Reddit. I live in the SF Bay Area but I do know a few Trump supporters (Can&#39;t pick family) and they aren&#39;t the type to be on reddit making post. Meanwhile, the majority of people I know in all age ranges and backgrounds are anti-Trump and all of them are active on Facebook and most of them are active Reddit users.</p>

<p>Hillary mocked these idiots as basement dwelling losers in her emails but they still keep doing it.</p>

<p>Take a look at the people they bus in for protests. They are pure followers who have no idea why they are there. Shills are no different. They are given an office space, computers, base scripts and direction. </p>

<p>At least military/intelligence shills (be they Russian, US, Israeli, etc) have the fucking excuse of national interests and security.</p>

<p>These shills are defending crimes and corruption in order to protect the people committing those crimes because they think those people haven&#39;t committed any crimes. Its pure cognitive dissonance, no different than a religious follower protecting a priest by hiding evidence of their child rape <strong>because</strong> they think they didn&#39;t rape a child.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>total transparency- i&#39;m completely ignorant about shareblue. but are the people in favor of this set to attack the left and bolster the right? if so, that is so incredibly ass backwards. </p>

<p>both sides, republicans and democrats, need to be voted out of all offices as soon as possible. THAT is the answer to this mess we&#39;re in. i hope people aren&#39;t wasting their time building up the right (or left) to attack the other side. that will get us nowhere. </p>

<p>but again, apologies if i&#39;m incorrect as to the intent of this post, and others that seem at first glance to be leaning right, or even hinting that one of the two parties is better than the other. they&#39;re equally corrupt, equally evil and need to be sent packing. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>They are not equally corrupt. Im not going to get into the debate, but that is simply just not true. When is the last time a dem with brain cancer rushed back from the Dr. to vote to take away health care? Come on man. Yes, Dems are greedy and self serving, but lets not pretend they are on the same level. </p>

<p>Secondly, simply getting rid of democrat and republican politicians will not change our situation. The people with the most money will find a way to buy power with whatever groups replace them.  </p>

Once &quot;shill&quot; became a common thing to call someone in the internet, a lot of stupid people got what they thought was a free pass in online arguments/debates. Anyone that disagrees with them is a shill, because they&#39;re obviously right and how dare someone challenge their opinion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My list was generated through first-hand experience here on Reddit over the course of the past election cycle.  All those items on my list, were themes I encountered repeatedly.</p>

<p>All the issues on your list are fine, but they skirt around the elephant in the room, which is the wealth/income inequality and the role of money in government.</p>

<p>Besides that, who does Shareblue represent, and who granted them the authority to speak for democrats?  Was there a process where democrats gave input to these messages?</p>

<p>While I was a democrat (before quitting the party), I became dismayed to see the messages coming out of my party, crafted by loathsome David Brock - those were not <em>my messages</em> as a lefty.</p>

<p>If you like David Brock speaking for you, have at it.  As long as he&#39;s the mouthpiece for the party, I&#39;ll find myself a third party.  Thanks.</p>

<p>This guy is pretty clearly derailing the topic as hard as he can. Ignore him and continue talking to people that have something to add to the topic at hand.</p>

<p>Part of voting in protest is that you&#39;re saying you&#39;d rather risk even worse repercussions than vote for someone you see as corrupt. I don&#39;t agree with that, but I understand why people do it. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I understand why you wouldn&#39;t agree with that.  I don&#39;t really like the logic myself.  It was a horrible dilemma for many of us, and every time Trump does something awful, it&#39;s particularly painful for me. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;d rather settle for the lesser of two evils, which I know is controversial here.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes.  But just so you know, many of us used to subscribe to the &quot;lesser&quot; argument for many <em>many</em> elections.  It was my crede in fact, and I chastised friends and family members who voted for Nader back in the day.  So I completely understand your position.</p>

<p>It&#39;s just that there comes a point when the lesser evil, is just too evil.</p>

<p>And that&#39;s the problem with corruption.  It&#39;s a great equalizer.  A corrupt democratic party really isn&#39;t that much better than a corrupt republican party.  </p>

<p>Corruption destroys trust in governance, and when that trust goes, so does our social contract.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No they didn&#39;t. The 17 intelligence agency bullshit is exactly that, bullshit but you can keep parroting it like MSM told you to.</p>

<p>Correction: June 29, 2017</p>

<p>A White House Memo article on Monday about President Trump’s deflections and denials about Russia referred incorrectly to the source of an intelligence assessment that said Russia orchestrated hacking attacks during last year’s presidential election. The assessment was made by four intelligence agencies — the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, the Central Intelligence Agency, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the National Security Agency. The assessment was not approved by all 17 organizations in the American intelligence community.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>WHO CARES, WHO CARES, WHO CARES, REPEAT IT ONCE AGAIN, SHILL!! may be be bit more technical and less obvious next time? Ask white buffoon Brock for better lessons? because people aren&#39;t that stupid to just look away from dozen bot riddled anti trump subs, just because you delegitimize multiples times... WE CARE, BITCH! YOU CAN&#39;T DICTATE US WHAT WE CARE OR NOT!</p>

<p>Also regarding you questioning and acting surprised as this sub leans towards trump more, compared to what MSM and Deep State pushes daily... I mean, really? Does it really need explanation unless you are mentally handicapped? FFS, man talked against mandatory vaccines and declassifying 9/11 documents during campaign, two of &quot;favorite&quot; subjects of this sub, of course they liked him long before he even was a president... Conspiracy theorists sympathize with men who fights establishment and hidden government, SHOCKER!</p>

<p>Now, every once in a while, some post stuff from t_d, or Trump related, that aren&#39;t related to conspiracies and I find them annoying too, but they don&#39;t get much traction, so does propaganda &quot;Muh Russia&quot; articles too posted here regularly. But there is multiple multi-million subs where those articles get upvoted to the top without a issue (news, worldnews, politics...)</p>

<p>ps: don&#39;t forget to collect your 0.20$ cent paycheck </p>
