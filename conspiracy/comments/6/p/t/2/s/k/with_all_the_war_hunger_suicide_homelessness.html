    <div class="md"><p>I didn&#39;t want to make a thread but I went back to my home town last week and found out friends of my family have a boy who identifies as a girl now. The age? Seven! I was like okay where did this child get this idea? For sure an adult put that in his head because no way a kid that young decided he was a crossdresser. It came out in a discussion with a school guidance counselor. So if you want to know where it&#39;s coming from, I would guess people like that. Would have loved to have recorded this conversation between a child and adult putting that shit in his head. I used to scoff that there was gender bender agenda but the school really is filling their minds with this shit. I knew effeminate kids when I was a kid who grew up to be gay, but the school wasn&#39;t telling their parents to buy them leatherman outfits. Kids should be kids not trannies. This is the line in the sand for me, I&#39;m fine with other lifestyles but at a much later age. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have no issue with people who are transgender undergoing a transition if it makes them happy, and I have met some teenagers who made the decision (with their doctors, parents, and mental health professionals) to transition before college in order to start fresh after high school. I do worry about very young children though. I read a letter from a mom who said that she has had to fight having her tomboy daughter labeled as transgender. Somehow we&#39;ve forgotten that sometimes little boys like to play house or dress-up, and sometimes little girls like to have short hair and play sports. It doesn&#39;t necessarily mean they&#39;re in the wrong body.  Sometimes it does-and that&#39;s something that needs to be handled by a team of doctors and mental health professionals. But if your six year old son wants to play dress-up, for pete&#39;s sake just let him play and don&#39;t start asking him if he feels like he&#39;s a girl. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>We don&#39;t know what the conversation was though. We are making assumptions.</p>

<p>We really should temper our reactions to corruption with compassion and understanding.</p>

<p>Age 7 is too young to <em>know</em> sexual preferences. Guesses can be made, but they are just guesses at this time.</p>

<p>I support people knowing that gay people and other queer hands of cards exist, because people will be dealt these cards and their suffering is no less taxing on their souls than it is on ours. Hatred blinds us to the suffering of others. </p>

<p>Awareness of queer hands of cards should be part of sexual education. Before puberty, people have a hard time understanding sex. They could be confused. I still don&#39;t think that you can alter sexual preferences with that confusion. It&#39;s just not the ideal way to raise people. You put them on tangents of silliness that may harm them socially. </p>

<p>Honestly, the most damage from this (considering the idea that core sexual preferences are not alterable from experience) would seem to come from peers trained by their peers and parents to attack and abuse queer people. It could be avoided. </p>

<p>If we really want to reduce sexual deviancy, we should focus on industrial chemical pollution that we know alters the sexuality of animals. That would show intelligence and compassion, not impotent, frustrating, religious reactionary fear over dogma. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Religions are mind control systems that employ dogma, blind faith in the unproven claims of perceived authority. They teach dogma that anything less than sex in marriage is wrong. This makes people see homosexuality and other sexual oddities as immoral, deserving of punishment in order to deter them. They think they&#39;re moral choices, not a difficult hand of cards people didn&#39;t choose. They do, because they believe God said they&#39;re wrong, because of dogma. If God punishes people for being what they can&#39;t change, he would be evil and people don&#39;t want to follow an evil God. So, they conclude and insist that sexual oddities are choices, not cards people are dealt that they can&#39;t choose.</p>

<p>So, they have an apparently irrational fear of a demonic conspiracy seeking to corrupt sexuality when any sexual oddities are accepted officially. They think it affects people&#39;s choices more than they feel compelled to honor people and the cards they&#39;ve been dealt. This personally offends them, as it should. A demonic conspiracy would affect them. Yet it&#39;s not. It&#39;s just what it appears to be. Their beliefs make this specific kind of crazy that atheists don&#39;t share. It causes LGBT people to live shitty lives.</p>

<p>This is why they fear the gay agenda, the trans agenda, any sexual oddities being accepted and talked about openly. It&#39;s all because they were suckers and believed that it&#39;s OK to blindly have faith in the unproven claims of perceived authority. Dogma is one of evil&#39;s greatest tools, like a trojan virus with open ports to the internet, letting hackers come in and run whatever code they want.</p>

<p>If only the rest of u would just calmly observe their insanity and see it not as actual mental imbalance, but as mental balance executing malevolent code. </p>
