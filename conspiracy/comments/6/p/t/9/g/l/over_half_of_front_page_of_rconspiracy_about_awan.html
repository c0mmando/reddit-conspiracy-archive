       Title says it all, we've all seen it happen with numerous other events throughout the last year. This has all the signs, the typical users, massive downvotes of ANYONE saying anything remotely against the narrative, tons of posts by few users. Thoughts?

       We'll see if this is massively downvoted immediately. I'd assume it will be. Will add links to all the posts on the front page for brevity when I get back to my desktop.

       Pretty sure he was going through my post history or the mod log seeing as his first response was to the stickied comment, your mention came later.

       It's completely off topic for this post, it was the deleted thread that user mentioned you in.
      </p>
      <p>
       The comment was asking for you to show me which of PresidentJamesComey's posts that were deleted were trolling (or deserved a ban). Ill try and save you some time, here is the comment that got him banned:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Hm, why is this man being brought up so often around here now? Now that tweet from that hacker comes to mind. I better read it.
       </p>
       <p>
        Are we officially on operation discredit journalists? Newsweek has been hitting Trump pretty hard.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       And I believe you asked for proof he was banned for shilling, this is the best I can provide it was sent to me after the thread was removed:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://imgur.com/a/eprlT">
        http://imgur.com/a/eprlT
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       I tried asking the mods if it was doctored but I was muted without a yes or no (they think I'm PresidentJamesComey, awaiting admins for the un-mute).

       So being sensitive is an offense warranting a ban eh? Both side of the aisle have people that can only understand the world as sith lords and only deal in absolutes. Either with us or against us.. "I'm being down voted looks like a raid from T_D." I'm being down voted looks like a raid from share blue." Yeah because the only people who disagree with you are shills and your opinion is the only true one out there any opposition to it must be nefarious right?

       The only stories that fill up the entire front page are anti Democrat stories at least since the mass influx of certain users around the beginning of the election cycle. Before this, I never found the front page completely full of a single story. Sure the big ones would make it to the top but this sub has been vote brigaded heavily over the last year.

       How can anyone dispute your argument?
      </p>
      <p>
       One of them were arrested, and this has been building for a while. I remember them talking about the Muslim Brotherhood and the Awans back during Obama, and then the DWS video where she is all over that police chief to get the evidence back. The smashed harddrives. I don't think it is a narrative blitz, it's something.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, it's not a conspiracy if you just look at the posters since some of them spam posts all the god damn time.
      </p>
      <p>
       So with that, I can possibly see how this is something. I can't dispute your claim though because this happens in conspiracy all the damn time now. Everyone is pushing an agenda or narrative and are willing to start ridiculous arguments with other crazies.
      </p>
      <p>
       And you did mention in an earlier comment that you didn't care about the Awan story, which I guess explains this post.
      </p>
      <p>
       It would be worth looking into how often the Awans we're discussed on this sub though, see how far it goes back.

       If its so fucking obvious, then you'll be able to make connections. Draw conclusions about the users who are posting these links. Check out the comments. Do some synthesis. Cause if its actually brigaded, you'd be able to tell, and make a substantive post instead of this whiney drivel. "BOO HOO PEOPLE ON

       so out of the top 13, its 8/13. better than 50% odds that if you click a random post on the front page it will be about the Awan brothers. is that enough of a connection for you?

       Again, major break in what many of us here consider to be the "big" conspiracy in our govt today. George Webb has been talking about the Awans for months. Fuel that with some WHAnon Truth/Larping, and you have plenty of people excited about it. Come here to read an Awan post, see another awan post and upvote it. Its the hot conspiracy at the moment and it looks organic to me. I've been on this sub for a long time... you can certainly see which posts are inorganic around here.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you really think this is a coordinated push. Check user account histories, and links between users pushing the same story. Often inorganic posts get linked by 3 different people within minutes. The users posting them have a one track mind (only posting on certain topics, extremely frequently) and post only within conspiracy. Make some at least
       <em>
        partially
       </em>
       substantiated claims and maybe I'll listen to what you're saying. But to me it sounds like you're trying to discredit Awan news with claims that it is inorganic. Simply saying "THERES LOTS OF AWAN POSTS BROH (11 out of 25 is not that many)" is not going to cut it.

       Is it so strange that this could be organic? George Webb has been talking about the Awan brothers for ages now, saying they're a lynchpin to a buttload of corruption. I, and many other users, have been following this drama. This is a major part playing out. Whenever something "big" happens the front page is flooded with it, because thats what people want to read about.

       It's pretty noticeable. The least nefarious explanation to describe what's happening is that the mods are just lazy about enforcing their own rules (I.e. 6, 11, 12) and cleaning up blatant duplicate threads.

       Eh... it was one of those things that is kinda like we heard about it from a bunch weird news sources and YouTube channels and infographics with no solid evidence aside from maybe that DWS/police chief video that the Awan brothers was really a thing... now it is getting a little bit more "mainstream" coverage... so it is kinda like seeing a previous conspiracy theory starting to maybe come to life right before our eyes. Some people are excited from a conspiracy standpoint... some others are prolly from T_D or partisan in some fashion.

       people being excited. Not everyone gets their news from the same place, and when the story broke everyone posted their go to news source. The reason I think there are multiple is because while every post is about the same thing, they all have some piece of information that wasn't included in another article. My opinion though, I think the next 24 hours will be a better indicator.
