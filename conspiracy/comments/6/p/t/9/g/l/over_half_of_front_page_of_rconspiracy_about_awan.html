    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s completely off topic for this post, it was the deleted thread that user mentioned you in. </p>

<p>The comment was asking for you to show me which of PresidentJamesComey&#39;s posts that were deleted were trolling (or deserved a ban). Ill try and save you some time, here is the comment that got him banned:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hm, why is this man being brought up so often around here now? Now that tweet from that hacker comes to mind. I better read it.</p>

<p>Are we officially on operation discredit journalists? Newsweek has been hitting Trump pretty hard.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And I believe you asked for proof he was banned for shilling, this is the best I can provide it was sent to me after the thread was removed:</p>

<p><a href="http://imgur.com/a/eprlT">http://imgur.com/a/eprlT</a></p>

<p>I tried asking the mods if it was doctored but I was muted without a yes or no (they think I&#39;m PresidentJamesComey, awaiting admins for the un-mute). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>How can anyone dispute your argument?</p>

<p>One of them were arrested, and this has been building for a while. I remember them talking about the Muslim Brotherhood and the Awans back during Obama, and then the DWS video where she is all over that police chief to get the evidence back. The smashed harddrives. I don&#39;t think it is a narrative blitz, it&#39;s something.</p>

<p>Now, it&#39;s not a conspiracy if you just look at the posters since some of them spam posts all the god damn time.</p>

<p>So with that, I can possibly see how this is something. I can&#39;t dispute your claim though because this happens in conspiracy all the damn time now. Everyone is pushing an agenda or narrative and are willing to start ridiculous arguments with other crazies.</p>

<p>And you did mention in an earlier comment that you didn&#39;t care about the Awan story, which I guess explains this post. </p>

<p>It would be worth looking into how often the Awans we&#39;re discussed on this sub though, see how far it goes back.</p>

<p>post 1: pizzagate</p>

<p>2-5: awan</p>

<p>8: 4chan larp</p>

<p>12: assange/trump/trans issues</p>

<p>13: hillary</p>

<p>from there 3 more on the front page.</p>

<p>so out of the top 13, its 8/13. better than 50% odds that if you click a random post on the front page it will be about the Awan brothers. is that enough of a connection for you?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Again, major break in what many of us here consider to be the &quot;big&quot; conspiracy in our govt today. George Webb has been talking about the Awans for months. Fuel that with some WHAnon Truth/Larping, and you have plenty of people excited about it. Come here to read an Awan post, see another awan post and upvote it. Its the hot conspiracy at the moment and it looks organic to me. I&#39;ve been on this sub for a long time... you can certainly see which posts are inorganic around here. </p>

<p>If you really think this is a coordinated push. Check user account histories, and links between users pushing the same story. Often inorganic posts get linked by 3 different people within minutes. The users posting them have a one track mind (only posting on certain topics, extremely frequently) and post only within conspiracy. Make some at least <em>partially</em> substantiated claims and maybe I&#39;ll listen to what you&#39;re saying. But to me it sounds like you&#39;re trying to discredit Awan news with claims that it is inorganic. Simply saying &quot;THERES LOTS OF AWAN POSTS BROH (11 out of 25 is not that many)&quot; is not going to cut it. </p>

Not everyone gets their news from the same place, and when the story broke everyone posted their go to news source. The reason I think there are multiple is because while every post is about the same thing, they all have some piece of information that wasn&#39;t included in another article. My opinion though, I think the next 24 hours will be a better indicator. </p>
