       "The Peak Oil school rests its theory on conventional Western geology textbooks, most by American or British geologists, which claim oil is a ‘fossil fuel,’ a biological residue or detritus of either fossilized dinosaur remains or perhaps algae, hence a product in finite supply. Biological origin is central to Peak Oil theory, used to explain why oil is only found in certain parts of the world where it was geologically trapped millions of years ago. That would mean that, say, dead dinosaur remains became compressed and over tens of millions of years fossilized and trapped in underground reservoirs perhaps 4-6,000 feet below the surface of the earth. In rare cases, so goes the theory, huge amounts of biological matter should have been trapped in rock formations in the shallower ocean offshore as in the Gulf of Mexico or North Sea or Gulf of Guinea."

       Colonel L. Fletcher Prouty spills the beans about how oil was deliberately, incorrectly classified as a fossil fuel, when in fact it is Abiotic.
As such, it is a replenishable, naturally occurring source. Peak oil is a myth, or more accurately, a lie. Just like almost everything else the establishment ever told you.

       regardless of origin, I don't know if we'll ever see "peak oil" due to the increasing efficiency and heightened demand for renewable sources of energy.  By the time the peak oil was predicted (2030s) we may well be largely off of it.

       Nice strawman, nice attempt to diminish the stupidity of your comment suggesting that evidence of something that is physical could be found on your favorite search engine. Nobody here mentioned CNN let alone stated that evidence of anything could be found on CNN.

       Yes, because subjective mystical evidence is good for fact building.
      </p>
      <p>
       The placebo effect mixed with a sense of superiority is a hell of a drug. If there were something to "see" there would be objective evidence. Not some Reddit mystic saying that things are like that because they are.

       I don't mind reading, but I'm not going to accept a claim as bold as every fossil being fabricated without some serious evidence, which you should be able to provide without telling me that I'm just not able to see it. If it were objectively true, there would be objective proof you could show me. Not subjective experiences that prove nothing.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the fabrication is obvious, you should be able to point out the points of fabrication. That's how faked paintings/signatures/pictures etc. are discovered. Those are able to be Objectively proven fake. You have no way to objectively prove your claim. Present that and I will continue this debate.

       i'm pointing you towards a book that is designed to help people draw, but it also helps you to literally see through the lies. once you really start seeing what's in front of you instead of what your brain thinks is in front of you, nobody can fool you. not nasa, not the government, nobody. you wanna look at all the ridiculous, clearly made recently "fossils" and think it's true because somebody told you it's true, go ahead.

       Okay, but all you can offer is subjective experience. If you could point out objective points of fabrication we'd have something to talk about. I don't have an issue with government agencies lying to people. I do have a problem with massive claims with no evidence other than "you can't see it." If it were a fabrication, you would be able to
       <strong>
        objectively
       </strong>
       show the points of fabrication.

       Abiotic Oil - carbon present in the magma beneath the crust reacts with hydrogen to form methane as well as a raft of other mainly alkane hydrocarbons. The reactions are more complicated than this, with several intermediate stages. Particular mineral rocks such as granite and other silicon based rocks act as catalysts, which speed up the reaction without actually becoming involved or consumed in the process. -

       Abiotic Oil - carbon present in the magma beneath the crust reacts with hydrogen to form methane as well as a raft of other mainly alkane hydrocarbons. The reactions are more complicated than this, with several intermediate stages. Particular mineral rocks such as granite and other silicon based rocks act as catalysts, which speed up the reaction without actually becoming involved or consumed in the process. -

       This is one of the craziest movies I've ever seen about Black Gold or early pioneers seeking Oil. It runs 3 hours and I saw it quite awhile back...there's a point in the film where a
       <em>
        productive well went dry and it devastates the man
       </em>
       -
       <strong>
        only later the damned thing starts producing again
       </strong>
       . Crazy movie!

       Not sure this is a HQ vers. (also have no time signature to give to my point of even posting!) it runs like three hours - so you decide:

       There could be something to this, or it could be that they were pumping it too hard, formation pressure went down, and they couldn't produce anymore at the time. Then, once formation pressure went back up, it began producing again. Not trying to start an argument as to oil's origin (I'm not really leaning one way or the other in that regard without more proof), but I do have some experience in the oil business and have definitely seen some idiots pump wells too hard or kill formation pressure through improper injection planning.

       Yeah, I'm sure you're correct about the formation pressure and the extraction technique but it goes with the story line to the conclusion...

       Oh yeah. Regardless of petroleum's origins, we need to get as far away from burning it as we can, as fast as we can. Unfortunately, it's just not going to happen until the market naturally supports a shift (i.e. more affordable alternate energy sources). However, I imagine we'll be using it for plastics for a far longer span, so it's not like the industry will just disappear overnight.

       What Id like to know is, if these animals/plant life got stuck under that many square feet of dirt/rock/clay, what could move that much material? A meteor that could move that much tonnage, wouldve destroyed the planet. How could anything else survive, let alone evolve, under these conditions?

       It has been discussed more on r/conspiracy vs r/science where it is pretty much unheard of. In fact, it has barely been discussed in all of reddit. Your not impressing anyone. Majority of people have never heard of Abiotic Oil, why? because it goes against the "green" agenda scheme which is used to force regulations on people and allows the governments to have power and control over the people. Besides that it has been known for at least 60 years not a decade.

       Oil is a resource we can use. It doesn't keep our bodies alive. That's just using a dramatic spin to prove a point. The earth's oil isn't going to all dry out at the same time, if a well dries out and goes into its replenishment cycle there are millions of other wells still producing.

       LoL dramatic? Like the earthquakes that follow closely behind bleeding out the lubrications between tectonic plates?
      </p>
      <p>
       The water they pump in is less viscous than oil... thats why you don't use water as a lubricant in engines. Friction.

       I've always been skeptical about fossil fuels and peak oil because of our military's dependence upon fossil fuels. We wouldn't be getting so close to running out of oil if running out of oil means running out of war. War is the most important thing in the world to TPTB.

       You could be right. Do we have nuclear drones and fighter jets though? ICBMS? We need fossil fuels for the most important aspects of our military.

       We have the technology... but we don't do it because it's cheaper to rely on fossil fuels, and the military will likely buy their fuel in advance and store it underground.

       my geochemistry book is just itching to write up how off your conclusion is. oil is biotic. here's how it goes: biogenetic methane is produced by the breakdown of buried organics during a thing called diagenesis. next catagenesis converts the biogenetic methane to kerogen which breaks down into bitumen... the simplest of carbon chains found in oil. there are also carbon isotope markers we can use to classify age, and maturity of an oil sample and approximately what it's composed of. you know what octane grade is? that's how well we understand the process. but peak oil is dead.. so we can agree on that

       Like all at once or over a period of time and billions if them? Because if it's the former I don't think the Earth would've survived that impact. Or did it somehow reproduce and multiply here?
      </p>
      <p>
       Also why wasn't any found on the moon? It's relatively close and has had millions of impacts.

       More the material is in the tail of the comet which as it passes close the Earth, causing a whole bunch of catastrophic effects, the tail is what the Earth actually passes through. The materials held in the comets tail enter the atmosphere.
      </p>
      <p>
       Oil wasn't found on the moon because:
- No one has looked for it
- No one has been there ;) 
- It has seeped into the inner part of the moon (the moon is hallow BTW)

       I attended a university class in the heart of Siberia a few years ago, a lecture called "On the economy of oil and gas", dispensed by a professor formerly researcher at Gazprom and formerly geologist for the Soviet State.
      </p>
      <p>
       I asked her: where does oil come from, is it really of biological origin?
      </p>
      <p>
       In a very nonchalant (but kind) way she answered there are two theories, the fossil and abiotic theories, none of the 2 is either proven or dominant, that her colleagues are split half/half, and that she herself leans towards the abiotic hypothesis.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was amazed at such a balanced, open-minded response. I thought to myself this would be unlikely in the West where fossil fuel theory is like a religion.

       From the latest that I've read on the subject. Oil was created from the period before we had fungus that could digest wood. Which meant that forest were not "bio degradable" for a couple of multiple millions of years trunk of fallen tree would just sit there until buried by other bio mass.
