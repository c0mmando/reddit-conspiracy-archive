       Is Trump ban of Transgendered people in the military the distraction WhAnon was talking about? They said it will start on Trumps twitter feed and snowball from there. Or is this all just stupid LARP and Trump just managed to piss off even more people?

       Idk. But, I have zero fucks to give about transgendered people being banned from the military. They're mentally ill. Would you have a paranoid schizophrenic in the military? Or a person with alzheimer's? It's only a distraction for the SJWs.

       Easy there. Calling transgender people mentally ill is pointless and bigoted. I'm not someone who necessarily agrees with the SJW culture, but saying they are mentally ill is far worse than what SJWs are doing. Do I think there's something fishy about the agenda behind this rise of Transgenderism? Sure. Do I think all transgender people are mentally ill? Hell no.

       I've have many discussions with a lot of transgender people and I can tell you they haven't shown ANY signs of being mentally ill. It's a choice. Just like pedophilia. It's not a mental illness, it's a CHOICE. Why spread hatred towards someone who is a woman and wants to live their lives as a man(and vice-versa)? Why claim they are mentally ill? From what I understand, transgenderism is more of a phase or due to the current state of society being confusing af. Society pressures people into stereotypes, and when someone doesn't fill those stereotypes, they get confused about their own identity and seek groups of people who are similar to them. I suggest you look more into this instead of throwing hatred and calling them mentally ill.

       Nooooo, I'm just saying a lot of people are trying to argue that pedophilia is also a mental illness. It's not. Are those people sick in their minds? Definitely. Just like a shitload of people out there. But it's a choice. It's not some condition that's treatable and those who ARE exposed as pedophiles shouldn't be treated as mentally ill people.

       Just because I think they are mentally ill, does not mean I hate them. I don't believe it is a choice. In fact, many of them have stated they have felt that way since they were born. It is a mental defect.

       That is psychosis.  Transgendered people are mentally ill.  That said, it seems to me a fairly harmless form of mental illness in most cases.  Certainly it's less harmful than the mental illness known as 'religious belief'.

       There you go, you were able to give a direct negative impact that thinking oneself was a dog would have on being a soldier. Constant barking would be bad.

       Now that we know you are capable of grasping the concept, I'll ask again. How would being transgender actually affect a soldiers ability to perform their duties?

       Forget the military for a minute. Let's just discuss becoming a police officer.

       Before you can become a cop, you have to take a written exam, a physical fitness test and a polygraph.

       Let's say you pass the written exam, you pass the physical fitness test, but you failed the polygraph.

      <p>
       Let's say you failed the polygraph because you weren't honest about drug use...fuck it...lets say you were honest and admitted to having a crack cocaine addiction 5 years ago.
      </p>
      <p>
       You would not be eligible to be a cop.
      </p>
      <p>
       You maybe in recovery, you may even do a decent job if all the stars aligned. But, they are not gonna take their chances on hiring a cop who used to have drug issues.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lets say you have a history of domestic violence. Your ex was a psycho and she slashed your tires, pulled your hair, clawed and scratchdd you, so you back handed her across the face and left a mark. Sorry, not eligible. You have shown that you are not 100% of sound mind.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, you may argue that a lot of psychopaths get into law enforcement. But, the difference is...they had no prior mental illness issues recorded and were able to function without showing any signs of mental illness upon recruitment.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now someone who is transgendered will have a track record of mental illness.
      </p>
      <p>
       For one, they were confused on what they were since birth. A lot of them are suicidal, depressed, hung up on how society views their peculiar personality.
      </p>
      <p>
       Their identity becomes the focal point of their existence. Things that troubled you as an insecure, self-doubting puberty approaching teenager is something these people still deal with as an adult.
      </p>
      <p>
       Those who make the full transition then live in a delusional narcissistic perception of themself that is not accurate.
      </p>
      <p>
       Cutting off your dick does not make you female. Just like cutting off your legs doesn't make you a midget.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is a mental illness.

       I'm not even arguing if it is a "mental illness" or not. I don't really care, and it isn't relevant.
      </p>
      <p>
       See how you pointed out the obvious flaw in hiring a crack addict as a cop? They might abuse the drugs they are meant to confiscate, etc. See how you were able to point out the obvious flaw in hiring a domestic abuser? They have no respect for the law to begin with and they abuse people.

       Now, see how you
       <em>

       come up with any similar flaw that a trans person would clearly have that would interfere with their duties? Exactly. Your argument is feels &gt; reals. You have no practical reason that trans people can't serve in the military, and instead just throw around the term "mental illness" as a buzzword and think it makes a point. It doesn't

       I agree that depressed and suicidal people should not be in the military. That is separate from being trans. Native Americans also have a high suicide rate, should they not be able to serve? Or should they just be evaluated on an individual basis rather than some horseshit profiling because you don't like a group of people

       You left out the most important one of them all..."delusions of grandeur". Anyone who believes they are a different gender than what they are is delusional. Delusions are part of mental illness. This has nothing to do with choice or free will. This has to do with a person being so mentally screwed up in the head that they have to pretend to be someone else to feel "normal". It's no different than a narcissist going through life assuming he is the 2nd coming of Christ. It is a delusion of grandeur to think you're a hot chick named Tiffany, when you're really a hairy male named Tom.

       I have repeated myself a bunch of times so there isn't really any point, but I will try one last time. PTSD has obvious direct effects on ones capability to serve; PTSD can cause a person to freeze up during a flashback or incite a violent episode. What direct effects on a persons ability to serve does transgenderism have?

       Once again I am forced to repeat myself, but I already was very clear that I don't think depressed or suicidal people should be able to serve. That goes for straight people, gay people, trans people, I don't care. That doesn't make a blanket ban for trans people in the military any less stupid. It would be the same as banning native americans from serving because their suicide rate is high or mexican-americans because their diabetes rate is high. People need to be evaluated case by case, otherwise it is just idiotic racist/sexist profiling

       There isn't really anything left to say here. You are just using the term "mental illness" as a meaningless buzzword and not making any attempt to apply it to the real world. My comparison to minorities is valid; you said trans people shouldn't serve because of a high rate of suicide, that is exactly the same thing as saying native americans shouldn't serve for the exact same reason.

       As far as pedophiles go, there is a community of then who claim to be attracted children, but have never harmed any. They are looking for equal rights similar to LGBTQ. In fact, they have shown up to some of their rallies, but the gay community has yet to accept them.
      </p>
      <p>
       So given that, should they be allowed to teach children?

       You can't compare native americans to transgenders because being native american is not a mental disorder. If they have alcohol problems or whatever, then sure. But, just being native american does not mean anything. The same cannot be said for transgenders. They all have mental disorders by definition. It's called Gender Association Disorder or Gender Dysphoria. There is nothing idiotic about scientific fact. Sorry it doesn't match with your feels.

       Your cousin lied on a polygraph? Police departments all set their own criteria. It's up to them if they accept people with drug history. every case I know of they do accept them but won't if that history is recent.

       Maybe, I haven't thought about it. Any practical reasons why they shouldn't (he asked knowing full well that the commenter does not grasp this concept)? However, it's inappropriate for any teacher to express attraction to their students regardless of whether they are under 18 or not

       I can, and am, comparing suicide rates between them and other people. Your argument against this comparison is essentially saying "nuhuh". You are saying that high suicide rates are a reason trans people should be banned from serving. In case you haven't figured it out yourself yet, the mental issue that is dangerous there is depression, not transgenderism.

       Right, I don't disagree with you.
      </p>
      <p>
       People who are transitioning do require hormones and medical treatment, but then there are the people who aren't seeking medical reassignment and just want to live as a different sex.
      </p>
      <p>
       All I can think is there must be safety or infrastructure concerns/expenses for trans military? Or maybe there's been an influx of people joining the military to capitalize on the free gender reassignment? Otherwise, can't really see the point.

       It's a gov for the people by the people.  To discriminate along lines of "people who manifest their gender however they choose" is still discrimination.  It's an arbitrary distinction used by those who claim gatekeeper authority over those that don't conform to the gatekeeper's standards.  That's bigotry.  That's against the design of a gov premised "on all people being considered equal".
      </p>
      <p>
       If the argument is that changing the existing military to accommodate "people who manifest their gender however they' choose" is not currently feasible that begs a bunch of other questions.   How is that the most well funded branch of gov can't change its ways to conform to the standards of its constitution?  If they can't do it then who can?  No other branch has the chain of command structure to implement broad cross-cutting change like this, nor the funding to pull it off.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can see a move like this in a time of hostilities, under the umbrella that it's an unnecessary distraction to the conflict at hand.  But there's no current broad scale conflict.  Perhaps Trump feels that this could quickly change.  Is that the hidden message here?
      </p>
      <p>
       As to the mental illness label.  That's also an arbitrary line that is historically easily abused.  There are many people who have beliefs that differ.  Are those mental illnesses too?  Isn't the measure of ability to serve the only razor that makes sense?  If that's not the line being drawn, then banning transgender people because they're transgender, perpetuates the same slippery slope that gays in the military issue used to be.  That used to be considered a mental illness too, eh.

       I think most people believe they are something they are not. I'm a fan of Freud, and that's kind of a cornerpiece of his work. The subconscious mind has fears and insecurities. Since it is hard to actually face these fears the conscious mind develops lies we tell ourselves - and truly believe - that quiet down the madness coming from our subconscious.
      </p>
      <p>
       I guess I kind of agree with your definition, but I also think everyone has some degree of mental illness, just like everyone has some degree of physical illness.
      </p>
      <p>
       I suspect transgendered people have a wide array of mental states. Certainly many of them are absolutely nuts, and their transgenderness is an expression of that. But some of them are simply happier being another gender. I don't see anything wrong with that. I like my penis, but if someone wants to have theirs turned into a vagina why should I care?
      </p>
      <p>
       I was never in the military, but I did so a couple of years of ROTC. A lot -- a HUGE lot -- of people in the military are mentally ill. It's actually a pretty good refuge for crazy dudes.

       Then who is? Have you spent much time around the military? They specialize in crazy people who can't hack normal life. Now personally I think it is healthy to not fit in to our society because our society is fucked. But still, the military and crazy go hand in hand.

       Transgendered fit the bill as mentally ill. It's just PC, SJW bullshit to call it anything else. "Bigotry" is just a bullshit word used to sugarcoat when something has a fault. It's right along the lines of calling someone "a hater".

       I totally agree with this, but arbitrarily singling a group out a saying they can't join the army makes no sense. If they are incapable of doing the job they will fail out. There are surely some TG people who would do fine in the military, while most would fail.

       It takes two to tango, and this decision plays right into the hands of the people who
       <em>
        want
       </em>
       us to focus on BS identity politics.
      </p>
      <p>
       Personally I don't believe Trump could become president without being part of the game. He's not on our side any more than Clinton is. This whole thing is part of the distraction.

       i absolutely believe it's a distraction. no one was discussing this issue before he brought this up. this issue is also one of the craziest things he could propose at this point to get everyone discussing how crazy and ridiculous he is. it is literally the most believable yet outlandish thing he could propose. i wasn't even totally into the idea that trump is involved somehow but after today I'm thinking differently

       I've have many discussions with a lot of transgender people and I can tell you they haven't shown ANY signs of being mentally ill. It's a choice. Just like pedophilia. It's not a mental illness, it's a CHOICE. Why spread hatred towards someone who is a woman and wants to live their lives as a man(and vice-versa)? Why claim they are mentally ill? From what I understand, transgenderism is more of a phase or due to the current state of society being confusing af. Society pressures people into stereotypes, and when someone doesn't fill those stereotypes, they get confused about their own identity and seek groups of people who are similar to them. I suggest you look more into this instead of throwing hatred and calling them mentally ill.
