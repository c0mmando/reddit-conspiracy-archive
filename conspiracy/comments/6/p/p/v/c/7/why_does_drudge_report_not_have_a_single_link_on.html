Just about every country does that has an invested interest in USA policy (quite a few of them).

The real question is whether Trump campaign was explicitly involved with the Russian in the meddling of our election. And that remains to be seen/proven with solid evidence...sorry but Trump JR meeting with some sketchy Russian attorney claiming to have dirt is not collusion.

</blockquote>

<p>You certainly have to admit, though, Junior&#39;s email didn&#39;t make explicit collusion <em>less</em> likely, now did it?</p>

<p>Be realistic: If I&#39;d told you last December that there was an email in which an attorney connected to Russian intelligence services promised to give damaging information on Hillary Clinton to the campaign, with it being <em>explicitly</em> stated that handing over this info was &quot;part of Russia and its government&#39;s support for Mr. Trump,‚Äù and that the campaign&#39;s response was &quot;I love it especially later in the summer&quot; -- you wouldn&#39;t have believed me.  It would&#39;ve seemed too on the nose to be believable.</p>

<p>Now, you say, &quot;That&#39;s not going to do it alone,&quot; but of course this data is not &quot;alone.&quot;  Literally the <em>day</em> this meeting happened, Trump started promising that he&#39;d soon be holding a press conference with explosive information about Clinton, and also began calling repeatedly for Russia hack and release Clinton&#39;s &quot;33,000 emails.&quot;  And lo and behold, <em>later in the summer</em>, Russia releases information hacked from the accounts of the DNC and John Podesta.  And of course, when this leak happened, nobody at the Trump Campaign thought, &quot;Hey, I bet the FBI would want to know that a representative of the Russian government said they supported our campaign and offered to work with us to release dirt on Hillary a couple months ago.&quot;  Kinda suspicious, no.</p>

<p>And then, of course, as soon as it becomes clear the FBI is investigating his campaign for potential collusion he fires his FBI director, tells Lester Holt it was because of the Russia investigation, and tells the Russian ambassador &quot;‚ÄúI faced great pressure because of Russia. That&#39;s taken off.&quot;  And now Trump is fuming on a daily basis about wanting to fire Sessions until he gets to an AG who will can Mueller. And this is on top of the insane consistency with which Trump has helped promote Russia&#39;s interests and refrain from criticism of Russia or Putin. </p>

<p>I mean, come on.  At this point, it&#39;s harder to justify an explanation of the known facts that <em>doesn&#39;t</em> involve collusion. Given the standard of proof accepted on this subreddit, this might as well be a signed confession.</p>

<p>Seriously, you could&#39;ve told me anything in 2016 (and even 2017) and I&#39;d shrug and say &quot;figures&quot;..bat shit crazy times. KEEP in mind that Trump JR is not a politician...has zero experience in political campaigns (which are a fucking tornado of activity and craziness) and I&#39;d imagine is not steeped in the legality of getting supposed dirt dug up by a foreign power on your opponent. So ya sure it doesn&#39;t really surprise me that he took the offer to hear some dirt. </p>

<p>The crime was the hacking. Did Trump/Trump JR/Campaign order or aid in the hacking? Don&#39;t think so. The hacked email/info was going to be thrown out to the world regardless of what anyone in the Trump campaign did or tweeted..sure timing of Trumps tweet is suspicious..but certainly could&#39;ve been coincidence. So basically Trump JR&#39;s so called &quot;criminal&quot; act was not reporting that their was dirt floating out there on their opponent..? Ok. Pretty weak. Now if you have evidence that there was an actual ongoing conversation between team Trump and Russia to do whatever the fuck you&#39;d do to win the election, then I&#39;ll jump on board with you and say &quot;COLLUSION!&quot;...but a one off meeting with sketchy Russian attorney who supposedly had information that was going to be publicly anyways....give me a break.</p>

<p>Regards to Comey. I don&#39;t blame Trump for firing him. He&#39;d told Trump 3 times privately that he wasn&#39;t under investigation but wasn&#39;t willing to say it publicly...that&#39;s what Trump was pissed about. </p>

<p>A foundational doctrine of western common law is that ignorance of the law is no defence. If someone has the resources to be actively involved in a presidential campaign then they have the resources to seek proper counsel regarding their activities and familiarise themselves with the relevant statutes. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>There are multiple factors here: one is conspiracy (often misleadingly referred to as &quot;collusion&quot; by the press) and the other is the hacking. You shouldn&#39;t conflate the two. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>She&#39;s not just some sketchy Russian lawyer.</p>

<p>She&#39;s the official opposition to the Magnitsky Act in America, and is tied to Russian Mafia and government officials. I&#39;d be more than happy to go over this with you, because her mere presence at that meeting to discuss &quot;adoptions&quot; with the top levels of the Trump campaign is pretty damn close to being the smoking gun.</p>

<p>The Magnitsky Act was the American response to a massive fraud committed against an American businessman named Bill Browder. Russian Law Enforcement stole corporate IDs belonging to Mr Browder, and then somehow those IDs wound up in the hands or Russian organized crime. Russian organized crime then proceeded to perpetrate a massive, incredible fraud using those IDs to obtain a 230 million dollar tax refund from the Russian government...... It&#39;s a really incredible story, and gives a ton of insight into how business and government operates in Russia.</p>

<p>The Magnitsky Act was the American response. Mr Magnitsky was a Russian Lawyer working on behalf of Mr Browders business, that was charged with a crime and basically murdered in a Russian prison before going to trial. There&#39;s a lot to it, but that&#39;s the synopsis.</p>

<p>Now, the &quot;Lawyer&quot; - The Russian response to the Magnitsky Act was to pass a law barring adoptions of Russian children to the United States. This woman is not just a &quot;Lawyer&quot;, she&#39;s basically the Russian representative in charge of trying to undermine and eliminate the Magnitsky Act. So, when you hear Trump junior saying that he discussed &quot;adoptions&quot; with this woman what do you suppose she was really referring to? When Trump had his off the record meeting with Putin at the G20, and it became public what did Trump say they talked about? Adoptions.
Adoptions is just a thinly veiled reference to the Magnitsky Act, which froze the assets of Russians and cost them potentially hundreds of millions of dollars. </p>

<p>And that&#39;s just this &quot;Lawyers&quot; involvement in this........ Believe me, it&#39;s goes a hell of a lot deeper than this. She also represented &quot;Prezvon Holdings&quot; in NY........ And once you start taking a closer look at that, you&#39;ll quickly realize just what it is that you&#39;re looking at.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He also referenced God today, when he said that America worships God not the government.</p>

<p>It&#39;s clearly red meat for the conservative base. I think it&#39;s because he&#39;s getting ready to axe Sessions, and he knows there could be potential backlash from the Republicans ....... So what he&#39;s trying to do is get the base on his side, so any Republican that stands in his way after he fires Sessions will face the wrath of the Trumpkins.</p>

<p>Trump has never hesitated to attack any Republican that stands in his way. He basically high jacked the party. </p>
