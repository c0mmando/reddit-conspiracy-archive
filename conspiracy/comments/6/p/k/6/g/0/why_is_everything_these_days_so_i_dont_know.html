     <div class="card-body md">
      <p>
       A good example of what I mean is the r/politics subreddit's top banner - it's a childlike looking doodle-whatever creature thingy smiling like an infant and carrying a flag
      </p>
      <p>
       This theme is pretty much everywhere in advertising and media and tutorials and these weird explanation videos and everything - it's like it's emotionally stuck at 5 years old where everything is either childlike excitement or total hatred and butthurt
      </p>
      <p>
       Even the supposedly "adult" stuff basically just tries too hard to be cool and obsessed with brand awareness and whatnot or it's some over-the-top 'bad ass ness' and uncontrolled acting out of anger and whatnot - and the few attempts of showing a truly mature character usually seem insincere and like cardboard-cutouts of what a child would imagine some kind of idealized caricatured all-knowing elder person to be
      </p>
      <p>
       Sometimes it's "almost there" but something almost always feels very "off"
      </p>
      <p>
       I would say that it all feels like an act - but then I suppose you could say it actually is an act
      </p>
      <p>
       When is the last time you saw a truly instinctively mature character in Hollywood that wasn't basically just a "wise old man speaking with a charming voice teaching kids a lesson" stereotype or someone with superhuman abilities like omniscient intellect or the ability to run away from bullets? I mean - a character that actually questions stuff and comes to reasonable conclusions and is constrained by realistic limits?
      </p>
      <p>
       It's just so hard to find anything satisfying in public media anymore - something satisfying for a mature person and not just "for the kid inside each of us"
      </p>
      <p>
       If you believe ads then the most satisfying thing that a mature attractive woman can think of doing is to eat Moewenpick ice cream - it's so fucking retarded it's not even funny but actually scary
      </p>
      <p>
       The thing is - I don't think it's an accident - I don't think the people who create this stuff are immature - I think they do this to stop people from development - because children are easier to control
      </p>
      <p>
       It's almost like the media has conspired to eliminate the awareness of the fact that any human archetype beyond the age of 5 years old actually exists and thus we never develop into it and instead maybe start feeling crazy because we have feelings that go beyond jolly-everhappy little smilies and semi-retarded characters
      </p>
      <p>
       Or maybe it's just that they simply only care to speak to those that are most easily molded to generate a lifelong attachment
      </p>

       Yah - well I do use smileys every now and then - what bugs me is not their existence (just like I don't mind the existence of children) but when this "mode" of functioning seems to become the only option of communication and living and working with others

       Well, people are "children" until they are 27 now for insurance purposes, aren't they? There was a great thread here a couple months ago about the phenomenon of actual children being forced to act like adults while simultaneously, are being prevented from actually growing up. It was vaguely pizzagate related, but well researched. I'll try to find it for you.

       Yeah not bad. Interesting point about the whole "children being portrayed as wise" thingy. This is definitely one of the things that irks me these days. A scene that comes to mind is Neo taking lessons from that kid with the spoon. And I was thinking to myself, that kid has no clue what it's talking about and looks more like it has dissociated due to trauma or whatever and now it's trying to impress adults with wise sounding stuff.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would say that this thing also kinda applies to my own life quite a lot, but then, that's anecdotal evidence at best and not indicative of a conspiracy per se. Just one anecdote I remember ... when I was some 15 years old or so I wanted my mother to take me in her arms. Something I am generally very reluctant to do for other reasons. Guess what happened. She somehow moved weirdly and then SHE was in MY arms. It was disgusting.
      </p>
      <p>
       The transgender thing at early ages is extremely disturbing to me too. I don't get how anyone can do this / let them do this to themselves. As are parents managing their kid's social media account. Makes my neck hair stand right up.
      </p>
      <p>
       I wanted to say something more, but I forgot what it was, sorry.

      <p>
       Sons Of Anarchy, Breaking Bad, Twin Peaks (2017 version) has a lot of serious and mature characters.

       I am not sure. All I know is that something feels "off" to me about it. I still like it, a lot. But it doesn't seem, how would you say ... "full". One very obvious example are occasional slapstick scenes that are "comedized". For example that whole bathtub thingy etc., obviously just done for the laugh. I mean, it's a good laugh, but it's also kinda slapsticky.

       have you seen True Detective? or The Killing? Both of those shows are pretty dark and serious. I've only seen the first season of True Detective though, but season 2 is a completely different story with different characters.

       Hm, nope, not seen it. But with serious I don't necessarily mean "dark". There is more than enough "dark and gritty" stuff out there but I also find most of it rather immature.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now before you call me crazy ... there are actually movies that come close to what I would call serious and mature, but they are not from Hollywood. Ever heard of Takeshi Kitano? They don't try too hard to entertain or anything and they seem to be more calmly self-conscious, but they are still very enjoyable, at least to me.

       I hadn't heard of him until now but I recognize some of the movies he's in. I might check out some of those movies cause I'm getting more interested in Japanese and Korean stuff.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would still recommend checking out True Detective. Maybe "heavy" is a better way to describe it? It's not serious because of gore or violence, although that stuff is still there. It's serious because of the tone / themes / dialogue. There's a lot of philosophical talk in it if you're into that.

       It's just consumption. Most entertainment is the intellectual equivalent of a burger-chain sandwich. People are more ready to "consume trash as distraction from life" than to "partake in an experience."

       It's not an incapability to discuss things seriously, it's that this is the internet. Most of my peers will sit around all weekend with friends and have serious discussions over a beer or a joint but when it comes to everyday life it's time to put your head down and make it work, humor and childishness helps dull the ache.

       I'd say it's mostly that (since you work towards what the majority want in order to sell anything), but I think you might be missing the sense of artistry and requirements of production that go into these things. We can't present "reality" with real accuracy - any production is a practice in removing as much as possible so as to keep attention with the momentum of the piece. A lot of "realistic" minded creations aren't entertaining... so people generally don't watch them, and there's less reason to make those productions because of it - plus they're complicated, which makes it harder to engage with the character (because you simply don't know more and what you're given is varied).
      </p>
      <p>
       Archetypical characters have a lot of associations that people still place with them (filling in the rest of the character) - looking at Jung, Campbell and the like, I feel they speak well to the appeal of simplified characters, and there's importance to that representation, I mean, if you feel story telling has any merit whatsoever. But beyond that, it's easy for a writer to write a bad character or dull situation. If anything, maybe you can just call this a perspective on quality - better quality media would hold your attention by not letting you get distracted by boring characters and "childish" situations. I can't say.

       Yeah it's never realistic per se. But still, your authorship of a movie grants you the freedom to design the abstraction that it is in any way the medium allows (for example, you can hardly include actual smell in a Youtube video).
      </p>
      <p>
       And my perception is simply that this freedom is abused, that's all. Yeah, they like to refer to "act structure" and "optimized storytelling" but I think it's just a bullshit excuse.
      </p>
      <p>
       "better quality media would hold your attention by not letting you get distracted by boring characters" ... but at what point are our senses so oversaturated that everything is perceived as boring? At what point is a movie that is aggressively loud and overly "epic" overkill? Holding someone's attention is not necessarily a criterium for great quality. Or at least it's a way too simplistic view of art. Think of food - would you reduce everyone's diet down to gummi bears just because they hold children's attention more than broccoli and other stuff that are also important for a "full" diet? I'm not saying gummi bears are bad, but eating only gummi bears makes your teeth rot and also makes you feel sluggish and in the long run will probably kill ya.

       Sorry for text wall, a mistake when it comes to attention tee-hee...
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe authorship isn't as complicated anymore, sure (as in, we can make something and put it online instead of finding someone to fund it without evoking their own intents). But it's still not an easy task. Authorship still holds the very real problem of moving from concept to reality - there's always that gap. If I want to make a sci-fi epic, I have freedom in concept, but when it comes to making it, I am required to make concessions, if I want to see it made, period.
      </p>
      <p>
       And these calls are made constantly - from getting a specific shot (Oh there goes daylight and we're $10k over budget, so it's not happening) to having specific lines (Actor James doesn't want to say this because his character wouldn't say it) to finding people to see it (the picture on the poster isn't interesting enough to gather any further interest, and I've already spent $8 million on this film without advertising). It's a complex procedure especially when more people are involved, that's why these large media companies have so much power: they have the means to isolate problems and manufacture.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most "act structures" come from perceived frameworks taken from prior creations, academic rundowns, and then applied elsewhere, but something like "three-act" setup is just a traditional method that people found that works (it provides a momentum for attention). Story-telling has been around a long time and people have simply found shortcuts that work to the ends of story-telling and replicate them because they work - just like any creation process. It doesn't mean everything's been covered, though, sure.
      </p>
      <p>
       Which, I don't know - maybe you're right, maybe attention is not so ultimate in this regard. But I don't agree it's a simplistic view of art. Every movement in music, in a story, in a film, in a painting - everything about these types of media is about containing attention; the very act of having a line drawn instills visual attention, the very transition of one note to another provides the illusion of continuation, to capture and hold the attention of an observer.
      </p>
      <p>
       Think of a scene in a comic book. If you put the "viewer" facing a character, just so you can have a character say something in a scene, you've already established
       <em>
        a lot
       </em>
       - depending on the production, just to have a character have a word bubble would likely require specifying a scene for it to take place in, giving context as to the dramatic elements ("the stakes involved"), drawing a face (how complex? Two eyes or not? A piece of hair here? Either way it'll affect how someone relates to it, which is what you're trying to craft. If you put a coffee machine in the background of a scene because you drink coffee in the morning, someone else can think you're intentionally putting coffee in the scene to support coffee as a beverage. Personally I'm amazed anything even gets made half the time - but it does, because (most) creators don't scrutinize this shit. It's a lot of ambiguous overhead that just creates blocks to a real thing being made.
      </p>
      <p>
       But on a larger point - if something isn't attended to, does it even exist to you? If you listen to a piece of music and lose interest, you stop listening. If you look at a painting and it doesn't hold your attention, you don't think about it, you don't consider it, you probably won't remember it. Attention keeps you with the thing itself, without it you're not conscious of it; how much focus you put on the product changes how you relate to it, consider it further, draw associations with it etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course I wouldn't reduce people to gummi bears only, right, but that doesn't mean there isn't reason kids are drawn to gummi bears and would still pick them over broccoli. This is why the cognitive and crowd psychology revolutions are such a big deal - they taught corporations and government how to have people attend subconsciously to wanted messages, even if they are intentionally trying to ignore any of it. Which creates more content like that... easily digestible, easily distracting from every day life... which creates more need for people to create towards those ends because it's what people consume, and so it's normalized and circular. Because it's easy and convenience is premium.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm curious if you can name any movie that fits your standard around this. I used to be more critical of film but I'm unsure now, at this point I get what I want out of a film, or I just don't bother. Some people don't keep a distance to their media, some might over-do it (I say this as someone that used to over-do it). I could name some films you might enjoy, but I don't think I could tell what you'd enjoy.

       Sorry for the late reply. I did read it all! You made a lot of points though, so I'll just pick some.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes, the gap is real. I didn't mention it, but I'm an amateur filmmaker myself. But what I said still applies (I hope I am not confusing you with another commenter): The choice in which parts you abstract and how you tell the story, even if not exactly "realistic", is still yours to make and you can make a choice to dedicate yourself to making something really good by your own standards or you can dedicate yourself to making something that SELLS really good.
      </p>
      <p>
       Which also ties into your other point about attention - I don't think that the fact these things hold attention is necessarily a positive in general, more of a marketing ploy.
      </p>
      <p>
       The more in-depth knowledge about how to emotionally manipulate people is also not a positive - it creates a lot of emotionally manipulative content that promises you something exciting - but never delivers. So basically you sit in there hoping for a resolution to all the problems you have been presented - but it never really comes or comes in a crude way. Think about what is really happening here - you are putting people in an emotional fight-or-flight mode. It's actually painful. That's why it holds the attention - not because it's beautiful, but because it's painful. Just like you would pay a lot of attention to someone who is holding you in a cell and torturing you, looking for clues to end the suffering.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, spontaneously I can think of movies that do come close - the movies of Takeshi Kitano. Not Hollywood, naturally.

       Agreed that you do have a say in the production choices. Maybe I'm just stuck in 20th century models that limited exposure because of content choices and media gate-keeping.
      </p>
      <p>
       Calling it manipulation... I don't know. If I say hello to someone, that can be seen as a form of manipulation. Any communication causes an outcome. I might be convinced at this point that human beings just naturally manipulate each other - as we naturally manipulate ourselves in pretty complex ways. I used to treat the term a lot more negatively, now it's neutral to me, but I only say that because it can be both malicious and disinterested, that is, I don't excuse it.
      </p>
      <p>
       All media is "emotional manipulation," and in different degrees codified and formalized for methods, and I would say it often delivers (just maybe not for you). I'd say a "good piece of drama" will excite and pull attention with that drama and pain, but
       <em>
        resolve it
       </em>
       properly. Resolution in itself is a science. Consider how easy it is to cause pain without noticing (say you're frustrated and make a rude comment to someone you care about), but to resolve it you need to have an understanding of your comment and how it was taken which is pretty variable.
      </p>
      <p>
       At any rate, I can agree that drama is a certain kind of beast, and your points are valid, that it is in a sense a contained pain. I can't say that's "good" or "bad," because the richness of experience in life is theoretically what life is about. Personally I have much experience with "deadening myself" to these things purposefully, but then I found myself with nothing but ennui; it's taken me years to accept that ups and downs are both valid. Intentionally creating this strife through engaging with media though, I don't know.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've never seen Kitano. I'll take a stab though - you might have interest in Federico Fellini (particularly), Jacques Tati, Fritz Lang, David Lynch, Alejandro Jodorowsky, Takashi Miike, Louis Malle, Giuseppe Tornatore. If any of those work out I could recommend some more if you're interested, but generally you might want to look into the French "new wave" movement and films associated with that era.

       This is hardly a new phenomena. Have you ever read Tolkien's work? Actually
       <em>
        read
       </em>
       it, not just watched the movies?
      </p>
      <p>
       While I adore Tolkien's creativity and imagination, it can't be denied that his writing is very... Infantalizing. "Oh how the nasty orcs pinched and teased the poor hobbits!"
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean. It's primarily what Moorcock is moping about in Epic Pooh (Of course, his Elric was
       <em>
        juvenile
       </em>
       if not childish. "Oh my, what an impressive sword. Mayhap I should polish it for you, Lord Elric." Juvenile is what you tend to end up with when you rail against infantile origins. People overcompensate.) that British fantasy is essentially just epic nursery stories.
      </p>
      <p>
       My point is this - This isn't a new phenomena and it's not some elaborate media conspiracy. It's the way media has been for ages.

       It's like we're going back to pictographs and hieroglyphs, ...only  very limited, ultra simplified, and somehow more primitive. It makes me feel put off by anyone who is entertained by it. I wish there was an 'emoticon' for 'hey you mouth breathing fucking moron, learn to type words'.

       You nailed it, the unspoken rule of TV/Hollywood:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         Reasonable, mature, strong, and self-confident men do not exist. Unless they work for the government.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Feminine and confident women do not exist at all; they are either needy and capricious; or behave like men; even when they work for the government.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Husbands are children that couldn't take care of themselves, have stupid ideas and immature cravings; thankfully their wife is there to manage them and supervise the household.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Civilians are panick-prone beasts; they need to be fed, coralled, reassured; utterly incapable of taking care of themselves in a crisis; the benevolent government (cops/soldiers) need to be ever-present to protect them.

        When is the last time you saw a truly instinctively mature character in Hollywood that wasn't basically just a "wise old man speaking with a charming voice teaching kids a lesson" stereotype or someone with superhuman abilities like omniscient intellect or the ability to run away from bullets? I mean - a character that actually questions stuff and comes to reasonable conclusions and is constrained by realistic limits?

       That's the thing ... I can't. It's something that I am missing from my own life too to an extent and it's a kind of "I know it when I see it, but I can't tell you what exactly it is". If that makes sense.

       Well, for example meeting my father at some point in my life hinted this thing (or a part of it) to me.
      </p>
      <p>
       But it's not so much that I have seen it as that I just know it's missing. Imagine you see a half-finished mechanical device, like a motor, and you see that some parts are missing, but you (being technically inept) don't know what they are or where to get them. If that makes sense. You just perceive the absence of something that should be there.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I also wouldn't say that it's a single thing that's missing. More like a whole complex of various things.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyhow, I mentioned the movies of Takeshi Kitano as something closer to what I mean. That is, I find them "fuller". I don't want to say they are a holy grail or anything, they are simply closer.
