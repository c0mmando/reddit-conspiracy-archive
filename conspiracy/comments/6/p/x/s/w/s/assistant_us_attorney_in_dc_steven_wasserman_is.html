        What's the source that he's "overseeing" the Awan investigation? Google doesn't return anything expect a made up story about Seth Rich and a related thread on t_d which has an almost identical image to your op

        As some comments in the_donald thread mention, he's a federal attorney in Washington and wouldn't be involved in a state arrest in Virginia.

       IANAL, but Imran Awan was arrested for bank/home equity loan fraud and I believe that would be handled at a federal level.
      </p>
      <p>
       A quick google search led me to believe the US Attorney's office would handle the case regardless given the nature of the charges, but that they have the option to bring charges in either state or federal court.  So while it is unclear whether DWS's brother has a direct role in this case, it appears the office he works in does.

       Sorry, I'm not sure the Seth Rich case ever warranted an Assistant US Attorney to be placed on the investigation.  At least, I couldn't find any information regarding one.  As far As I can tell, the speculation that Steve Wasserman killed the Seth Rich investigation seems largely based on his close relationship with DWS and that the murder took place in D.C.  But if that's the case, basically any influential, connected individual in Washington could've done the same.
      </p>
      <p>
       One interesting tidbit about Marando is if you google him, you'll quickly find he's married to a woman with the last name Wasserman.  I didn't delve into family trees or anything, but it doesn't look like she is related closely to the Wassermans in question; just a weird coincidence among the approximately 8000 Wassermans in the US, according to census data.  I'd advise not to make a new thread about that Wasserman, because she's a private citizen and almost anything beyond noting their marriage in the context of the public figure of Mr. Marando would likely be considered doxing.

       So after spending the last half hour updating myself on this topic here's my takeaway.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes, DWS's brother works in the office which is in charge of Awan's case.  However, it is a large office and he's probably not directly on the case.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's an interesting detail and if he's put on the case it would become big, but chances are there won't be anything here because of the conflict of interest which makes this so potentially big to begin with.

       This DC court affidavit and the case surrounding it appears to be why Awan was attempting to leave the country and was subsequently arrested at Dulles airport.

       The CIA so they could go get him.

       Sorry, I'm not sure the Seth Rich case ever warranted an Assistant US Attorney to be placed on the investigation.  At least, I couldn't find any information regarding one.  As far As I can tell, the speculation that Steve Wasserman killed the Seth Rich investigation seems largely based on his close relationship with DWS and that the murder took place in D.C.  But if that's the case, basically any influential, connected individual in Washington could've done the same.
      </p>

       One interesting tidbit about Marando is if you google him, you'll quickly find he's married to a woman with the last name Wasserman.  I didn't delve into family trees or anything, but it doesn't look like she is related closely to the Wassermans in question; just a weird coincidence among the approximately 8000 Wassermans in the US, according to census data.  I'd advise not to make a new thread about that Wasserman, because she's a private citizen and almost anything beyond noting their marriage in the context of the public figure of Mr. Marando would likely be considered doxing.
