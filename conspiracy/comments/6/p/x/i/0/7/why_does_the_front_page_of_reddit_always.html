       The site is and has been left leaning. Yet, it has been corrupted by the self-serving interests of outsiders, bots, shills, corrupted admins and overall it has lost features that support integrity in favor of supoosed improvements. For instance, we used to have accurate upvote and downvote totals. That would inform us of controversy. Now you need a friggin' browser plug in to see the fictitious, massaged vote totals. There is no good reason why we lost that information.

       Because all the data about the users that has been collected here reliably shows that it's a generally young, left leaning group?  And then if you add in Europe, even a lot of their more conservative groups would be considered "left" in America.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's just simple demographics of who comes here and what they're going to vote to the front consistently.

       Growing up, I remember they always made the enemy the "conservatives." They said they were anti science and old and stupid and uptight.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now I personally don't label myself, but I now see there is a huge effort to target people with "liberalism" in their youth. By liberalism I mean the SJW mindset. I know that may not be how all liberals identify, but that is what they are pushing. And it's hip and trendy and it makes you feel like you're fighting something. I know it did for me.
      </p>
      <p>
       The current push (and really it has always been this way):
      </p>
      <p>
       *Sex positivity (anything goes)
*"Equality" (They put a lot of topics under the guise of equality)
*Scientism 
*Anti-religion  (accept they love the pope)
*Gender equality (anything goes)
*Race wars (white guilt vs white extremism)
      </p>
      <p>
       And so on. Again I'm not trying to put all liberals into this category but most people are more liberal when they are young. They get you when you're young.
      </p>
      <p>
       The crowd on reddit is relatively young, so it is the perfect place to manipulate the user base.
      </p>
      <p>
       They portray any conservative viewpoints as bigoted and old-fashioned.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example, I may not agree with the current mindset that transgenderism is anything more than dysphoria/mental illness, with research to back this up.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would be labeled a bigot by the "progressive" Reddit crowd.
      </p>
      <p>
       The agenda? Honestly my viewpoint is spiritual so let me know if you're interested. To me it is a really a battle for our souls.

       100% correct. Also, yes Transgenderism is a mental illness . The fact that people are pushing it / allowing / advocating for CHILD sex changed is abhorrent and downright frightening

       How do you know that tolerance of transgender ideas is an attack on us without citing dogma, the unproven claims of perceived authority?
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe I am a spiritual seeker too, and I have considered the idea that the dark is corrupting our sexuality, but without evidence, only dogma, we create unnecessary fear that harms people who have to deal with these life situations. I understand that they can't just change how they are like some of us are lead to believe.
      </p>
      <p>
       Personally, I do think many of them would just get better overall satisfaction in their lives accepting themselves as they are and trying to make the most of it. It seems easy to segway into just being gay. Again, dogma derived fear of what they are greatly inhibits that process. Maybe they think if they can pass as the opposite sex and live as it, they won't get treated like walking garbage by the dogma eaters.

       It is due to the demographics that use Reddit. Idealistic wealthy western kids going to leftist universities and growing some kind of naive social conscience for the first time. 
Then they get busy in their post-grad jobs as bankers, start paying taxes, vote conservative and don't have time or care enough to post on a website.

       You didn't understand my point. I am not saying conservatives do not post on Reddit. The question is why does Reddit lean so hard to the left, and I am suggesting that the majority of people who have vast amounts of time, and vast amounts of energy to dedicate to r/esisting, possibly do not work, or have other time intensive commitments such as a career.

       Because they've never worked hard and earned a good paycheck or seen a pussy up close they really wanted to touch in their entire lives. Well most of us are working they are on Reddit, think about it. I drive by their mid 1990s Toyota Camry and they look at me in a newer, 500 whp STi and assume I'm a trust fund kid. However, I've been working since I was 13, I've been working at this job since I was 18 and I've spend the last 6 years developing my skill to earn 80k and bonuses a year. Worked, 70 hours a week sometimes. People don't understand the value of hard work anymore, the connection between self improvement and reward has broken.

       Both sides like to politicise what are perfectly logical, justifiable, and completely beneficial socio-economic measures like free-education and a guaranteed basic income for all citizens that would more than pay for themselves by what they would contribute and how they would stabilize the economy in general and most economists have long argued in favor of them while admitting that the only real arguments against them are purely political and without any sound economic basis to them.

       Virtually every open forum on the Internet that doesn't blatantly censor dissent tends to lean to the left. You won't like the reason if you lean right.
      </p>
      <p>
       The right is prone to arguments based on fear and that appeal to their identity, party, religion, rural, etc. They are not very good at detecting deception or logical fallacies.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fear is one reason. It is designed to shift our minds and bodies into a state appropriate for fight or flight behavior. So, blood flow is altered from digestion to the muscles and from complex though portions of the brain to the fast judgment and reaction parts of the brain. This is exactly what we need when facing predators in nature, not a long-winded dissections of the situation.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, as the mind accepts a fear based belief, it enters this fear mode that cuts off complex thought. It works on all of us and con artists use it to compel people to act quickly and stupidly.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ok, the reason why every open forum on the Internet that doesn't blatantly censor dissent leans left is the format of the discussion. We have to encode our ideas into words and type them out to argue our points of view. So, the emotional thrust is diminished, including fear, as long as we don't immediately believe what is said.
      </p>
      <p>
       This allows us to apply more complex analysis to what is said, find the flaws in it and retort. Unfortunately, most of what conservatives believe is just fear based memes designed by those who know how to harness fear based thought to exploit others. When those ideas are put into open forums without sufficient censorship of dissent, the truth will be very likely to come up and reveal the ideas to be lacking.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are two or more ways to react to this. One could accept the truth without letting emotions, derived from previously held beliefs, get in the way. That is perhaps the most healthy and the most difficult thing to do. One could also just dismiss the truth as false in order to avoid changing beliefs and feeling the new state of feelings that go with the new beliefs. Changing beliefs can take days on emotional intense thought. That's exactly what many people on the right do.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is why people on the right are more prone to religious dogma. Dogma is belief derived from the unproven claims of perceived authority. It's sold with fear usually. In order to believe dogma in the modern world, you have to actually choose to reject the truth. The arguments against the protocol of believing dogma are so compelling that it does require willful ignorance to be maintained.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you are in the habit of rejecting the truth in order to maintain your beliefs and their resultant emotions, you are more likely to repeat that behavior in other intellectual arenas like politics.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can't argue against someone who won't accept the truth. As long as it's just you and them, you're screwed. However, the presence of honest, open minded third parties fixes that problem. Then they can back you up expressing their observation that your opponents refuse to accept the known truth. Although, they probably still won't admit you're right, as they have a habit of doing so.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        The end result is what we are talking about, a perception from the right that (insert name here) forum is left leaning. They reject the forum itself rather than fighting with ideas anymore. They seek like minded people to back them in their ideas and the judgement of the forum. They form conservative forums that employ censorship to stifle the very dissent that would compel them to alter their beliefs.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Fear, dogma and stubborn, wilful ignorance are to blame. Equivocation is one of the last refuges as this truth is presented. Look for it.

       Virtually every open forum on the Internet that doesn't blatantly censor dissent tends to lean to the left. You won't like the reason if you lean right.
      </p>
      <p>
       The right is prone to arguments based on fear and that appeal to their identity, party, religion, rural, etc. They are not very good at detecting deception or logical fallacies.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fear is one reason. It is designed to shift our minds and bodies into a state appropriate for fight or flight behavior. So, blood flow is altered from digestion to the muscles and from complex thought portions of the brain to the fast judgment and reaction parts of the brain. This is exactly what we need when facing predators in nature, not a long-winded dissections of the situation.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, as the mind accepts a fear based belief, it enters this fear mode that cuts off complex thought. It works on all of us and con artists use it to compel people to act quickly and stupidly.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ok, the reason why virtually every open forum on the Internet that doesn't blatantly censor dissent leans left is the format of the discussion. We have to encode our ideas into words and type them out to argue our points of view. So, the emotional thrust is diminished, including fear, as long as we don't immediately believe what is said.
      </p>
      <p>
       This allows us to apply more complex analysis to what is said, find the flaws in it and retort. Unfortunately, most of what conservatives believe is just fear based memes designed by those who know how to harness fear based thought to exploit others. When those ideas are put into open forums without sufficient censorship of dissent, the truth will be very likely to come up and reveal the ideas to be lacking.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are two or more ways to react to this. One could accept the truth without letting emotions, derived from previously held beliefs, get in the way. That is perhaps the most healthy and the most difficult thing to do. One could also just dismiss the truth as false in order to avoid changing beliefs and feeling the new state of feelings that go with the new beliefs. Changing beliefs can take days of emotionally intense thought. That's exactly what many people on the right do.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is why people on the right are more prone to religious dogma. Dogma is belief derived from the unproven claims of perceived authority. It's sold with fear usually. In order to believe dogma in the modern world, you have to actually choose to reject the truth. The arguments against the protocol of believing dogma are so compelling that it does require willful ignorance to be maintained.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you are in the habit of rejecting the truth in order to maintain your beliefs and their resultant emotions, you are more likely to repeat that behavior in other intellectual arenas like politics.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can't argue against someone who won't accept the truth. As long as it's just you and them, you're screwed. However, the presence of honest, open minded third parties fixes that problem. Then they can back you up expressing their observations that your opponents refuse to accept the known truths. Although, your opponents probably still won't admit you're right, as they have a habit of behaving that way.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        The end result is what we are talking about, a perception from the right that (insert name here) forum is left leaning. They reject the forum itself rather than fighting with ideas anymore. They seek like minded people to back them in their ideas and the judgement of the forum. They form conservative forums that employ censorship to stifle the very dissent that would compel them to alter their beliefs.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Fear, dogma and stubborn, wilful ignorance are to blame. Equivocation is one of the last refuges as this truth is presented. Look for it.

       Fear, dogma and stubborn, wilful ignorance are to blame. Trying to make opponents seem just as guilty of the same behavior is one of the last refuges as the truth is presented. Look for it. Recognize it does not negate the argument. They are trying to deflect it and attack the messenger to avoid changing beliefs.

       How do you know that tolerance of transgender ideas is an attack on us without citing dogma, the unproven claims of perceived authority?
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe I am a spiritual seeker too, and I have considered the idea that the dark is corrupting our sexuality, but without evidence, only dogma, we create unnecessary fear that harms people who have to deal with these life situations. I understand that they can't just change how they are like some of us are lead to believe.
      </p>
      <p>
       Personally, I do think many of them would just get better overall satisfaction in their lives accepting themselves as they are and trying to make the most of it. It seems easy to segway into just being gay. Again, dogma derived fear of what they are greatly inhibits that process. Maybe they think if they can pass as the opposite sex and live as it, they won't get treated like walking garbage by the dogma eaters.
