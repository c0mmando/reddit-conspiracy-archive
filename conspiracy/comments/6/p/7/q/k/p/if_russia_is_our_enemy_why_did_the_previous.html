    <div class="md"><p>Wow , you may want to have another look at some other reports and articles from when you assume Russia did these things . What ever you&#39;ve read or watched are very inaccurate .. Or you&#39;ve bought the US&#39;s and UK&#39;s  ridiculous attempts to frame Russia and wedge it into new conflict both hot and Cold War attempts . 
Probably start with Russia invading Ukraine . You&#39;ll find this just didn&#39;t happen .. and go from there . </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lol , ummm no . It looks like CNN and the like , have done their job well .. another woefully informed person ready to swallow what ever bull shit is fed to them about Russia. Try some independent journalists . I&#39;d recommend Robert Parry from ConsortiumNews.com  Look him up and read his reports and articles on Russia , Ukraine and the massive role the US plays in destabilising Ukraine , his work is  generally well referenced . 
Ukraine has long been a target of NATO / USA .. one of the last nations it now controls to keep Russia completely encircled .. </p>

<p>You can do this for every aspect of so called &quot;fake&quot; stories you care to write about.  You are, sadly, completely in the wrong if you think the predominate narrative of Russian meddling is innaccurate and you have direct access to the data to prove that to yourself.

    <div class="md"><p>In fact the website is a collective of journalists and bloggers from all over the world .. all contributing their pieces and reports on what&#39;s actually happening. 
I read every bit of the corporate media you seem to love . The same media that lies and distorts almost all news to keep those in the US and unfortunately the west as a whole stupefied and unwilling to research things further .. Try reading CounterPunch.com or ConsoriumNews.com , actually try and educate yourself some more .. you certainly won&#39;t , by only watching Fox or CNN which is laughable at best  . 
Read and watch the link I posted , I dare you too .. it&#39;s difficult at first to realise you&#39;ve been deceived by the media you&#39;ve grown fond of and believe to be truth  , but it gets easier when you laugh at the nonsense you used to believe . </p>

    <div class="md"><p>see, this is the sort of rude, presumptuous, self-aggrandizing arrogance so rife amongst the &quot;conspiracists&quot; which have cropped up over onto the Inter-tubes the past decade and a half.</p>

<p>It used to be, there actually <em>was</em> a difference of &quot;knowledge&quot; and &quot;understanding&quot; present in people who only knew what Dan Rather, Walter Cronkite and Tom Brokaw presented to them, reclining in their Barcolounger.  This is probably intimately familiar to you as the household of semi-literate mouth-breathers you grew up in.  And it had merit:  CBS, NBC, ABC are for-profit and want to be watched by everyone.  Their reporting was accurate, as far as it went, but it was not against the Establishment, until it became unavoidable.  For example, Cronkite was pro-Vietnam because that is what the government said.  Eventually though Journalism and Reporting one the day when he went to Vietnam himself and reported first hand about the false claims being made by the DoD.  It was <em>immediately</em> after that the anti-Vietnam war protests began in large scale (aka &quot;mainstream citizens&quot;).</p>

<p>In those pre-Internet days, one could read the NYT, the LATimes, the Chicago Tribute, the Washington Post, or any other cities&#39; large circulation rag and get mostly the same story.  Why?  Because those papers took stories from the AP wire.  Whose reporters are trained journalists, with a code of Ethics about objectivity, truth and facts.  The larger papers, such as the NYT, WSJ, and others had their own reports and so they were able to &quot;break&quot; stories ... but, regardless of which paper published the story first, the next day it was widely available.  And this was a Good Thing.  I agree that the various sources had their various slants and biases:  WSJ wants to cover topics from the &quot;money&quot; perspective and is inherently conservative, NYT from the &quot;societal&quot; and is also inherently conservative for different reasons.</p>

<p>The actual articles are largely the same:  mostly factual, mostly objective formatting coverage of world events.</p>

<p>Let me continue schooling your simplistic, dogmatic understanding of the world - since you started throwing ad homenin attacks, I&#39;ll continue them.</p>

<p>Along into the fray comes CNN.  Basically the same as the various newsprints.  Rapidly they obtained a world wide reporter base which earned them their fame of Gulf War 1.  FoxNews dove into this newly created 24 hour broadcasting, and quickly created a unique twist.  Namely, they discarded the traditional divide between Editorial and News.  FoxNews reporting (the very limited amount of air time it has) is just as reliable as any other source.  The Editorial sections which are the dominant FoxNews shows are ... well, accuracy, fair and truth are left in the waiting room.  CNN has gradually followed along this newstainment formatting, and have more editorial content now  ... I&#39;m not entirely sure as the only time I watch TV is at the airport waiting lounges.  It seems that CNN has slightly more Content than FoxNews ... it&#39;s academic, I don&#39;t really care.  What is highly relevant is the political motivation of the FoxNews founders and backers.  They succeeded in creating the groundwork for the cultural ignorance which the Internet exploded.</p>

<p>The result, twenty some years later, is that the formerly marginal nutter&#39;s who actually believe Black Helicopters from the UN are laser scanning their home&#39;s counting dollar bills has exploded from a few nutters, to ... well ... how many people voted for Trump?</p>

<p>&quot;Fake News&quot; is nothing new:  it used to be that people could distinguish the difference between the Equirer and the NYT.  Today, largely because the majority of Intertube denizens are of that semi-literate group you came from, they haven&#39;t learned how to tell the difference between Brietbart/ZeroHedge/InfoWars bullshit propaganda lies versus factual, objective reporting. </p>

<p>Why is this?  A combination of confirmation bias which people naturally tend to choose that which supports their pre-existing beliefs and a lack of critical thinking.  The result is that the Internet has run wild with crackpots espousing their personal agenda bullshit.  Eventually, people will gradually relearn how to distinguish between the profit-backed, agenda driven &quot;fake news&quot; sites and the Objective, Fact based reporting of what you disparagingly label &quot;mainstream media&quot;. </p>

<p>Is the New York Times mainstream media?  Is the Economist?  What about Mother Jones?  or The Nation?  Perhaps you don&#39;t think Rolling Stone Mag. is objective in it&#39;s writing?  Nutters who want to blame the problem on &quot;control of the mainstream media&quot; also conveniently ignore that the profit flow from the corporations which benefit from the alt-right agenda are the largest funder&#39;s of Fake News sites.</p>

<p>What these cranks have done is convince themselves that sites with decades of historical accuracy are wrong because they are making statements which the cranks disagree with.  Instead they have chosen to believe sources with hidden profit funding, blatantly inaccurate claims, false reporting and a language of division and hate.</p>

<p>If any group were to be labeled &quot;sheeple&quot; and be told to &quot;learn the truth&quot; I can&#39;t think of a better group than the alt-right nutters currently sticking their heads into a sand of deceit and corporate based agendas.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Bravo , a great response .. most of your points I&#39;m in agreement with . 
Mind you it seams misdirected , especially when aiming your labels  at me . I&#39;m far from alt-right ha ha I despise it , nor am I conspiracy theorist .. I am a progressive actually . 
You&#39;ve obviously paid long and close attention to your US media installations , as they slowly degenerate into irrelevance because of their biases and lies and unwillingness to decouple from their corporate masters. Much the same as our Murdoch controlled media here in Australia . Slowly people are waking up and realising there are alternatives .
Anything I say is very unlikely to change your way of thinking and I respect that , I&#39;m certainly not questioning your intelligence , I&#39;m questioning your perspective and your seemingly misguided faith in corrupted institutions .

    <div class="md"><p>I was using you in the general sense ... evidently I wasn&#39;t clear about that -- it was the desire to insult back I suppose.</p>

<p>So, the quaint little bit of social dynamics in the past twenty years of societal change is how those who perceive themselves as &quot;in the know&quot; of contemporary issues are precisely the exact same population which were until very recently self-proclaiming as being &quot;uninterested&quot; in following issues. </p>

<p>Now that the propaganda and dis-information machines of the Right have focused onto those people (specifically in the form of creating &quot;alternate fact&quot; memes) they have suddenly become the &quot;eyes wide open&quot; crowd.</p>

<p>This is the sort of elitist, only-we-can-see-the-truth arrogance which ushers in the fanaticism that ultimately gives rise to ... extreme far right groups.</p>

<p>Example, because Trump claims all criticism is &quot;fake news&quot;, his followers become entrenched and further dis-enfranchised.  This isn&#39;t a US issue -- the very same Nationalism and anti-Globalism has been growing throughout the world.  It has various forms, but is largely a result of the accurate perception that Wealth is flowing from the World into the accounts of a very, very small group of people.  The sad part is that Globalism isn&#39;t the problem -- it&#39;s the solution.  However, the profit based machinations of the 1%&#39;ers and their crony politicians has predictably corrupted the various implementations for their own benefit.  True, there are problems with Globalization, but they are more growing pains rather than systemic.</p>

<p>By allowing profits to be derived from war, the status-quo system of Capital accretion into the top is maintained.  The average person is further trammeled downwards, and they blame their decline on whatever bit of nonsense they read tells them to.  It&#39;s always Immigrants, Jews, Liberals and Minorities.  Never mind that the greed based actions of corporations can directly be attributed to the actual problems  -- clamoring against THAT would be biting the hand which feeds.  These average people don&#39;t notice they&#39;ve been misdirected because that constant war propaganda compels them to seek short term solutions for long term problems.  And, harder still for the sheeple to perceive is that it is <em>precisely</em> their desire to maintain a &quot;rich&quot; persons life style that the &quot;rest of the world&quot; increasingly suffers and perceives the problem to be &quot;Developed Nations&quot; ... and back to the start, as down trodden peoples rebel and attempt to regain national identity/sovereignty the war continues.</p>

<p>The Nation, Mother Jones, others have been writing about this hegemonic system since long before I was reading about it.  I would suggest you might benefit from reading Chomsky, Toffler, Dawkins, others.   You might enjoy it.</p>

Since Reagan and Thatchers neo-liberalism madness was unleashed in the early 80s the wealth and prosperity has slowly been diverted from the many to the few , with debt being socialised and profit privatised in most western nations , the only thing that can change this is an informed public .. and sadly in both of our countries they are in short supply . Due mainly to a complicit and corporate media ..  I&#39;ve followed US politics and history for years now and have always been intrigued .. but now with Trump and this vile GOP in power and every news bulletin Worldwide being about Trump and this bullshit smokescreen Russian collusion nonsense I just can&#39;t tolerate it .

<p>I don&#39;t follow ... you claiming that Trump and his closest campaign aides didn&#39;t get support from Russia via their election hacking/meddling?  Because, if that is your claim, it is not only incredulous a person could believe, it is irrefutably true.</p>

<p>I think that perhaps the scandal does lose something in it&#39;s cross-nation spread ... the crux of the issue is not whether Russia provided support -- that is resoundingly proven as true.  What is contested is whether or not Trump knowingly took their aid and lied about it -- that is the precise reason Nixon got in trouble.</p>

<p>the actual crimes, in both cases, were the least of their problems.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t get me wrong , I despise Trump and the GOP .. looking at Russia as a reason for Trump winning is absolute fantasy . </p>

<p>There hasn&#39;t been one shred of evidence offered up as to what exact impact Russia had .. nothing .. All but 3 of the apparent 17 intelligence agencies retracted their statements (NY times) , and once pressed the 3 remaining agencies offered up little to no evidence of Russia doing anything 
No evidence  of a hack because the DNC refused the FBI to investigate their servers .. some of his campaign people did have Russian connections and meetings as did Hillary and Podesta .  So far , apart from it being discussed a million times in US media from all sides . Not one shred of hard evidence has been offered .. 
Trump jr was just an idiot .. so called Russian lawyer had actually worked previously with Hillary while she was Sec State..   The big diversion is that should be investigated is how Trump actually won ... it&#39;s called Cross-Check and Cambridge Analytics .. The Mercer Family  and evangelical fascist far right are the ones who actually funded Trumps win and installed Steve Bannon , they got him over the line not the Russians . And even if Russia did hack DNC it proved how corrupt they are anyway , by cheating Sanders out of the running .. he would have absolutely romped it home and be on the way to helping the US economy serve the many instead of the few </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s a compelling case.</p>

<p>Knowing whether it is more accurate than the conclusion of the NSA, CIA and FBI is difficult from &quot;our&quot; perspective.</p>

<p>Democracy is profoundly undermined by an institutional reliance on State Secrecy.  This is an example.</p>

<p>So, I know many of those &quot;former intelligence workers&quot; having been one myself.  I trust their analysis, and it&#39;s possible that they are correct.  This is the reason the Congress is conducting their investigation.   The Agency&#39;s have previously stated they have confirming material of the hacking/theft, we&#39;ll have to wait and see which is the case.</p>
