        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Donald Trump is President and the entire establishment is in Panic Mode Deluxe. I really don&#39;t believe this was according to plan. I think they (tptb) went ahead of themselves and took a too Great of a leap. And with high priestess egomaniac physically ill Clinton being promised the post, it backfired completely. Not only did she lose, she lost to a true outsider. Obama/McCain or even Bush/Gore wouldn&#39;t have mattered. But Trump? Panic.</p>

<p>Instead of going on vacation after a devastating and humiliating loss, the lead star of Pizxagate John Podesta takes a job at CIA-funded Washington Post. Panic.</p>

<p>Two rockstars commit identical &quot;suicide&quot;. They also happened to be best friends and worked with helping abused children... One of them is an exact copy of WaPo&#39;s new star write r.  I call... PANIC.</p>

<p>They saved their &quot;big&quot; (desperate) &quot;scoop&quot; about Don Jr to bury the one year anniversary of Seth Rich&#39;s assassination. Panic.</p>

<p>This is honestly starting to look like a chess game, and it is becoming obvious who are losing. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed. It&#39;s hilarious to watch how urgently this thread is being downvoted. Go ahead, ShareBlue, keep on pushing me towards the conclusion that Trump is working to expose and destroy the Deep State. Keep on trying to force the narrative that Trump is a NWO puppet. Keep on trying and watch your strategy backfire. Apparently David Brock didn&#39;t learn any lessons from the failed CTR propaganda strategy for the 2016 election.</p>

<p>At the time, the mafia controlled pretty much everything. They had bought off senators, and they pretty much <em>were</em> the CIA.</p>

<p>Kennedy&#39;s father was in the mafia. They fully expected JFK to be on their side and helped him get into office.</p>

<p>Turns out, Kennedy was rebellious towards his father and the mafia, and refused to be their tool.</p>

<p>Which is why he was killed.</p>

<p>Now, we&#39;ve got a similar situation, just a different mafia.</p>

<p>The mafia now is the global banking elite, fronted in this country currently by the Clinton and Bush families.</p>

<p>Trump, in a similar fashion, had originally appeared to be potentially part of this mafia. So, they let him run, thinking Hillary would win, and they&#39;d just buy Trump out if he won.</p>

<p>However, Trump wasn&#39;t supposed to win. He was only supposed to scare us into voting for Clinton. Normally, I would say that they hedge their bets and would be OK with either duopoly candidate winning, since they could control either. How long was it after Obama won that peace prize that he started killing civilians with drones for the deep state&#39;s war profiteering? Trump has shown that he&#39;s willing to play ball to a degree, yeah, and he&#39;s definitely not for the people, but they had intended on him losing. They thought we&#39;d all be so scared of getting grabbed by the pussy that we&#39;d vote for the other piece of shit that they actually wanted. </p>

<p><strong>Donald Trump</strong> <del>is President and the entire establishment</del> <strong>is in Panic Mode Deluxe.</strong> <del>I really don&#39;t believe this was according to plan. I think they (tptb) went ahead of themselves and took a too Great of a leap. And with high priestess egomaniac physically ill Clinton being promised the post, it backfired completely. Not only did she lose, she lost to a true outsider. Obama/McCain or even Bush/Gore wouldn&#39;t have mattered. But Trump? Panic.
Instead of going on vacation after a devastating and humiliating loss, the lead star of Pizxagate John Podesta takes a job at CIA-funded Washington Post. Panic.
Two rockstars commit identical &quot;suicide&quot;. They also happened to be best friends and worked with helping abused children... One of them is an exact copy of WaPo&#39;s new star write r. I call... PANIC.
They saved their &quot;big&quot; (desperate) &quot;scoop&quot; about Don Jr to bury the one year anniversary of Seth Rich&#39;s assassination. Panic.
This is honestly starting to look like a chess game, and it is becoming obvious who are losing.</del></p>

    <div class="md"><p>They are all the same bloodlines. We as a species are very much interbred with one another. If you trace your family and really look for common ancestors, you can find connections that will startle you. Tens of thousands of us, if not millions, are distantly related to George Washington, just to give one example. </p>

<p>The Bushes, the Roosevelts, and the Adamses are examples of closely related persons in power, no doubt utilizing name recognition and family connections. Trump being Obama&#39;s twenty-sixth cousin four times removed is meaningless, because you and I could be more closely related to either one or both, and wouldn&#39;t ever know it without intensive genealogical research. </p>

<p>Literally anyone who becomes President is going to be found to have connections to people in power, because anybody with any European ancestry does. But if you don&#39;t care enough to map them out, and if you don&#39;t become famous enough for other people to take an interest, nobody will ever know.</p>

Go ahead, ShareBlue, keep on pushing me towards the conclusion that Trump is working to expose and destroy the Deep State. Keep on trying to force the narrative that Trump is a NWO puppet.
