      <p>
       Copypasted from KibBitzLaw's twitter feed (= Victory of the Light):
      </p>
      <p>
       "You have no idea what has been kept from you and for how long. That changes very soon. We've been here longer than modern man has existed
      </p>
      <p>
       As for who we are, we've been open and honest about it since day one.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your world soon changes in a very big way, but for the better.
      </p>
      <p>
       As we said, we are in the mop up phase of things...and that came about very quick.
      </p>
      <p>
       Once the mop up phase is over, disclosure will begin and we will be having a direct role in this process. So for now, we are asking you to assist by directing any media contacts you may have to our attention. We will explain to them how things are intended to go and who will be involved.
      </p>
      <p>
       The media needs to be brought on board first, as disclosure is intended to be made before the intel committees of Congress...and it is the intent of those involved that these hearings will be open to the public and broadcast to the world....because every person on this planet deserves to know the truth and, collectively, will decide what is to be done with collaborators who will be named as having committed crimes against humanity.
      </p>
      <p>
       We already know who will be involved with the disclosure process and, yes, it is currently the plan that in-the-flesh ETIs are to be present when this occurs. This is the one and only chance for any members of the media and Congress who have been going along with marching orders as political puppets and propaganda mouth pieces to step up and make amends for what they've done.
      </p>
      <p>
       Many were forced to do this against their own will, which is why they will now have the opportunity to exert true free will and either help us as their Mea Culpa, or rebuff us and face consequences deemed fit by the public.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course, there will be those who will not be afforded this opportunity for redemption, as what they have done exhibits a pattern of freely and willingly committing horrendous acts against their fellow humans. Again, this will all occur as the mop up phase transitions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Shortly after what we have stated above, fleets from both the benevolent SSPs of Earth and benevolent federations of ETIs will start making themselves known in very obvious &amp; public way. Whether the USAF likes it or not, they will not be in control of any US Space Corps...and they will be lucky to continue existing as a stand alone branch of the United States military once the treason at the top levels with respect to 9/11 &amp; other events &amp; matter is exposed
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the role of the United States in the post disclosure, post first contact era...you will be learning to "play nice" with the rest of the world. There will be no single superpower and there will no longer be competition between nations to try and control the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       You will be moving past that era of your history. That said, @PutinRF_Eng and Iran will be vindicated, while Israel, Saudi Arabia and the British elite including the royal family will be exposed for they really are at the top levels in each nation and how they have not only collaborated to draw the United States into conflict and undermine its power and safety, but did so with other nations in the hope of instigating WWIII to carry out what was a planned depopulation agenda created in league with certain malevolent ETI factions which would have left the elite as the survivors of humanity sharing the planet with an alliance of malevolent ETIs which deceived your leaders in the 1930s, when we all revealed ourselves to humanity for the first time in the modern era. Their goal was to officially conquer Earth and they got quite close to doing so.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your technological advancements since WWII can be attributed to these negative ETIs. While the tech may seem highly advanced to you, the reality is that it's what's called "junk tech" as in it's very basic compared to what is kept from you."
      </p>
      <p>
       "Swordfish is in the entertainment industry and received a green light from us via one of our sources who works in the industry. Our source is a music producer who, a few months back, stepped up to help us. There are good people in the industry...but everyone gets compromised to certain degrees and those who retain a sense of morality usually get out before they can't. Part of our job has been to foster and utilize these contacts. We foster them by what we taught people...forgiveness and redemption is available to anyone who steps up to do the right thing."

       Most of what he says is true but it is my opinion that he is overplaying his role and implication in this. He's accusing Defango of stuff without any evidence and it raised some questions on his true motivations

       He's definitely gone from somebody who "woke up" due to family history ties, to somebody who's pivotal and a key player in it all.

       I definitely believe a lot of it, but the escalation of his importance in it all makes me raise my eyebrow a bit.

       One thing that bothers me about victory of the light is the fact that early on they mentioned Henry Kissinger and then the next day he was in the White House talk to Donald Trump. It makes me think that they had knowledge that Kissinger was going to be visiting the lighthouse even though nobody else in the media or anywhere else knew that Kissinger would be visiting the White House. It makes me think that they're working with someone either in the white house or in government and they used the knowledge of Kissinger visit to make themselves seem more credible. If that is the case I kind of wonder if this just a honey pot?

       As much as I'd love for this account to be legit and that something GOOD is gonna happen, finally, I also can't help but think. But if this is  connected to Project Blue Beam? Definitely sounds like it could be. That's the thing with the world we live in. There's so much corruption, so much evilness, so much hidden truth that there's no way we can't know who or what to trust.

       Aug 21 is the great American solar eclipse. Black hole sun. There are a lot of occult and astrological meanings. It's a powerful event. Rumor on /pol/ is that there will be an attempted Muslim takeover starting in st Louis. If you have a chance look up the infographic, it's pretty strange.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sept 23 fulfills a prophecy in the book of revelations. Many people understand that the bible has a lot of astrological symbology, and that's what's happening. Basically the new messiah is supposed to come when it happens or something.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's a lot of detail so I just suggest you search the dates in the sub.

       I couldn't find the 4chan prediction, but it made connections to KEK, there are two green stars that look like eyes and a set of red underneath forming a smile when you look at a spot in the sky with infrared. Looks just like kek. And King Louis had frogs on his shield, there are arches in St Louis, a building with a woman and I think 12 lions or something, there's a significant amount of coincidences. Strange how I can't find the graphic though.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not saying I believe that they'd be able to take over at this point, but I imagine that could've been a plan, had Sandy Hook done its job and taken away American gun rights, and had Hillary won the presidency. I'll keep looking for the graphic, but apparently, something like 10% of St Louis is Muslim, and many of them were personally settled there by Bill Clinton.

       It will definitely be interesting to see how things turn out in St Louis. Seeing that you are someone who finds this as a topic of interest, do you have more information on the August 21st date? And what is your opinion about all of this?

       Aug 21 is just the eclipse. The first eclipse of its kind by the way, since 1776. It's also 33 days before the preset revelations Sept 23 date. And 33 is a very sacred number in numerology.
      </p>
      <p>
       It kind of creeps me out that I can't find the graphic. My opinion? I think something big is coming. I don't think society will collapse, but I believe that some big things will be revealed. Perhaps we will have nibiru in view during the eclipse.
      </p>
      <p>
       Apparently, it's supposed to be chaos beginning on the eclipse, and on Sept 23 the new messiah will save us from the chaos. So, I think that we will have a pretty crazy few months, but that's all I think. The Trump/Russia bullshit can't last forever, I believe that's all going to come to a head soon. It's all coming to a head, I just hope people are ready when it comes.

       Very coincidental that it's the first eclipse since 1776. But holy shit, the 33 day difference between August 21st and September 23rd really is creepy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since you mentioned the Trump/Russia issue, I find interesting that the rhetoric has increased in the lead up to the August 21st. We're less than a month away into August 21st and I'm kinda anxious to see what happens by then.
      </p>
      <p>
       This might just be a hunch, but I have a small gut feeling that they might try to push the Project Blue Beam during that timeframe between August and September. They have a legit cover for it and the federal government won't be under scrutiny because of the Trump/Russia issue. Very convenient cover for them to use. I just hope nothing happens. Just like Reagan said, the only way to fully unite the people and the government is an alien threat.

       Well, got to get rid of the old Muslim temple first I am guessing.  It is also Israeli law that Jews can't step foot on or worship in the Temple Mount area.  Guessing that will have to change.

       There is almost no astrological symbology in the Bible. There are people who apply astrological symbology to the Bible.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not saying they're right or wrong, only that this even more difficult than interpreting Bible prophecy, and no interpretation should be given anything close to the weight that revealed Scripture is given.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you can find me a commandment in the Bible to read it in accordance with astrology, or even a guiding text on astrology, I'll take a loot at it.

       I suppose you just need to look at it all in a different way. If you take the bible as fact for fact, literally, that's one way to look. Another way is to look at the rest of ancient texts that are heavily influenced by astrology and numerology, recognize the influence of the occult and freemasonry throughout time, recognize that the text in the bible has been corrupted and intentionally used to mislead the masses for centuries, and then you see that there could potentially be astrological symbols in the bible. Nowhere is there any direct "this is symbolic for the stars" because tptb want the masses to remain as simple minded as possible.
      </p>
      <p>
       When there are as many significant instances of numerology and astrological 'coincidences' in the bible, I think that it warrants pointing out at the very least.

       I'm not saying there aren't, in fact the Bible does say that the stars can be used for "signs," and that the stars led the Magi to Jesus.

       I'm only saying that there is no guide within the Bible itself to astrology, thus anyone claiming a definitive interpretation of an astrological event as "Biblical" is suspect.

       How about the parts in Job &amp; Psalms where God takes specific credit for creating the belt of Orion, Pleiades and ursa major (bear) in addition to the entire Mazzoroth (all 12 constellations).

       Or the Bethlehem star that proceeded Christ's birth. Why are you so surprised the spiritual birth that the Body of Christ is about to undergo is any different?

       Again, the Bible does not describe "how to do astrology" anywhere. It simply notes that the stars function as signs, and then it describes various signs in the heavens.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's really no "how to" on astrology, at least not since most of the writings of Enoch were lost.

       Prayer and interpretation via the Holy Spirit is all you need. Genuinely ask for it to be revealed to you, and He will through means that you can relate to. What works for myself and others may not be what you need to hear.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is one of the 'mysteries' that wasn't revealed until the last days. Rev 12:1-2 specifically has at least THREE valid interpretation of what the "woman" represents. The same is true for the "red dragon". Multiple. All valid.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's easy to miss, but the Word also specifically gives you the location to look for BOTH signs. In fact it makes it a point to say the same about the location of each.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where is that location?

       I would also add to re-read the Olivet Discourses in Matt, Mark &amp; Luke. Jesus specifically implores us to watch for signs on both the earth and in the 'heavens'. So although there is no "astrology for dummies" section in the Bible, there are plenty of hints that tell us where to look in the end times, which we find ourselves in presently and that the stars primary purpose as stated in Genesis at their creation is to serve as 'signs'. It's a fantastic way to show something to the whole world while circumventing language barriers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not even the devil can cover up these heavenly signs. He can only spread false truths and attempt to distract people enough to keep them from looking up and intrepreting what is about to come upon this world while connecting it to prophecy as revealed from the Word. Unfortunately he is damn good at what he does too, hence why it will be like a "thief in the night". This world has no idea what's coming, none whatsoever. Even within the Body of Christ, so few understand (or genuinely want to). Prophecy isn't for the feint of heart, it carries a heavy burden with it.

       It's certainly a possibility, thank you for that. Graham Hancock among others have raised awareness to the potential for asteroid impacts in the near future. The earth goes through periods of heavy impact every 12 or 13 thousand years or so, and we are almost due. You may be on to something.

       If they start getting the media attention they seek, more likely a psyop in preparation for the Blue Beam. They could be writing it's prologue.

       Swordfish is most likely disconnected, and they've coopted it in case it turns out being correct, which will give them more validity.

       Playing the meme game. VoTL is.
      </p>
      <p>
       VoTL is in many ways a reflection of many users in this community. They will see the top posts of the day, take them for the unquestionable truth and jam them into their narrative without doing the research to test claims.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, it's putting ideas out there, and seeing how they ripple across the collective.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think a post like this is excellent. Hopefully some users on the fence will read the more skeptical comments and leave with a more critical lens of VoTL, opposed to accepting the utopian alien narrative that for those who "want to believe" will believe undoubtedly.

       Why I'm one comment a while back you state that Antarctica is home to the light bringing ETIs that are hear to help but in another comment say that is home to the remainder of the third Reich and the greys? If the greys gave the third Reich the technology for UFOs  how could they have lost the war to a nation who did not yet have this technology.

       Could be, but if their historical understanding didn't make sense I wouldn't go any further. But they are right, there is a war for America and we did come close to losing her. May still, but I like our chances way more than I once did.

       True. Back in May votl tweeted this:
      </p>
      <p>
       "Our mission is to let humanity know that you will be wiped out by your own hand or a malevolent, more advanced, off world species before any of the many ETI races watching dare allow your entire species to learn the truth of the interstellar travel u already possess and the highly advanced off world ETI tech you possess. For them to let humanity do this without you being united as one species with respect for many different cultures influenced by ETIs would be like allowing a toddler to chug a sipping cup of whiskey and then run around the house with a fully loaded six shooter which lacks a safety. Get what we're saying?"

       <em>
        Cooper, Behold a Pale Horse, 1991
       </em>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        During his first year in office, 1953, at least 10 more crashed discs were recovered along with 26 dead and 4 live aliens. Of the 10,4 were found in Arizona, 2 in Texas, 1 in New Mexico, 1 in Louisiana, 1 in Montana, and 1 in South Africa. There were hundreds of sightings.
       </p>
       <p>
        Eisenhower knew that he had to wrestle and beat the alien problem. He knew that he could not do it by revealing the secret to the Congress, Early in 1953 the new President turned to his friend and fellow member of the Council on Foreign Relations Nelson Rockefeller. Eisenhower and Rockefeller began planning the secret structure of alien-task supervision, which was to become a reality within one year. The idea for MJ-12 was thus born.
       </p>
       <p>
        It was Nelson's uncle Winthrop Aldrich who had been crucial in convincing Eisenhower to run for President. The whole Rockefeller family and with them, the Rockefeller empire, had solidly backed Ike. Eisenhower belonged heart and soul to the Council on Foreign Relations and the Rockefeller family. Asking Rockefeller for help with the alien problem was to be the biggest mistake Eisenhower ever made for the future of the United States and maybe for humanity.
       </p>
       <p>

        <strong>
         There is always the possibility that I was used, that the whole alien scenario is the greatest hoax in history designed to create an alien enemy from outer space in order to expedite the formation of a one-world government. I have found evidence that this could be true.
        </strong>
        I have included that evidence in the Appendix. I advise you to consider this scenario as being probable

       They are insane indeed. The stage might be set for various scenarios, quoting votl:
      </p>
      <p>
       "you will be learning to "play nice" with the rest of the world. There will be no single superpower and there will no longer be competition between nations to try and control the world."
      </p>
      <p>
       and/or
      </p>

       Both of those statements don't inspire a whole lot of trust in this disclosure for me. Both of those statements sound like something a prison warden might say to his new inmates. It sounds like peace by force, and I don't think I'm into that.

       I know we've discussed HLI's statements on ETs before but I still struggle to reconcile his information with this information. I find it all endlessly fascinating, but that particular discrepancy bothers me.
      </p>
      <p>
       My current mindset is to assume that all of that information (from anon insiders over channelings to crop circles) is coming from more or less the same source and contains varying degrees of untruth or confusion on purpose, as well as contradicting each other in parts on purpose; not necessarily to conceal important aspects of a bigger truth, but rather to protect it from abuse, by creating a puzzle that only a collective humanity could hope to solve.
      </p>
      <p>
       Should that be correct, then we should expect HLI to be deliberately obfuscating a certain fraction of his discourse with misinformation as well. There are still a few claims that don't sit right with my intuition and judgment, like the Obama = Osama connection (though it's definitely intriguing) or the claim that aliens are pretty much irrelevant for our human evolution.
      </p>
      <p>
       Other than HLI's statements on the matter, what reasons do you see to assume that there are no aliens involved in this game of ours, if I may ask?

       I don't see much logic in your assumption that if various anons purposefully inserted some lies in their information, HLI did the same. What if not?
As to Ob/sama, I can understand why your mind denies and refuses to accept that TBTB would be able to make such a massive joke.... but let me remind you that this post is meant to discuss the credibility of the votl character who says he's an alien from Pleiades, and is using twitter to inform us about the Galactic Federation Fleet full of benevolent ETs which is parked in a nearby orbit and is ready to intervene and govern us whether we like it or not, and some such. What? Is this more credible to you than a fraud puppet installed as the Potus?

       I always enjoy the clarity of your remarks, thank you.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not unthinkable that HLI was truthful throughout their discourse. The vast majority of what they said certainly rings true in context of life's bigger revelations, and many things can be verified with some corroboration from other sources.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Obama Osama connection is one I struggle to accept even though the evidence has long convinced me. You're spot on, in saying that it's rather me not wanting such a ridiculous joke of a story be true. But alas, there they are, with all the same features, never public at the same time, handled by the same CIA handlers... It paints a picture.
      </p>
      <p>
       As to my view on Votl's discourse? I'm highly suspicious of it all, but I'm not convinced enough that we're alone around here to dismiss their alien story. I'm equally unconvinced that they are there, though, so I'm also not ready to accept their story either. I might still not believe their story yet if an "alien in the flesh" as they promised told it to me.
      </p>
      <p>
       As to why ET societies might have an interest in us and our planet, I can see many potential reasons. One might be that we're the distant descendants of one of the races, another might be that we've been colonized and infiltrated by another race. Some maintain that both of those are true.
      </p>
      <p>
       But alas, I'm still on the fence on this issue. I respect HLI's discourse greatly, but his view on this is opposed by a sizeable amount of data that indicates otherwise, and yet I give both possibilities about a 50-50 chance of proving true.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sorry,all of that is probably not very interesting to you, since we discussed part of this before. Thank you for indulging me, at any rate. It's always fascinating.

       I don't trust anything the cia says. I hear ya. Strange though considering this discloses the existence of aliens and them having an understanding of reality superior to our own. It's seems fear-based. Interesting none the less to consider,  there is disinformation about aliens , though sightings do happen.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since the eighties especially when there was a mild hysteria of being abducted. And to this day a sighting is a daily occurrence.  Feels like time to get it all out in the open.

       Playing the meme game. VoTL is.
      </p>
      <p>
       VoTL is in many ways a reflection of many users in this community. They will see the top posts of the day, take them for the unquestionable truth and jam them into their narrative without doing the research to test claims.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, it's putting ideas out there, and seeing how they ripple across the collective.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think a post like this is excellent. Hopefully some users on the fence will read the more skeptical comments and leave with a more critical lens of VoTL, opposed to accepting the utopian alien narrative that for those who "want to believe" will believe undoubtedly.

       I'll never believe any "malevolent alien" tale. Humans already have the capability to destroy the entire planet. If an advanced civilization wanted to "conquer" us, it would have already happened. Once a planet has evolved enough to travel between solar systems, it wouldn't have a need to go to war with another planet. Hollywood has set us up with this idea for a long time.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not beyond believing, however, that the MIC has created our own Orcs – genetically engineered and cloned earthbound "aliens" kept in DUMBS for a simulated invasion.

       Word, and I'm familiar with most of that (wish I had time for ALL of that), but I'm just addressing the "evil alien" archetype. I think our creators played with all kinds of gene sequencing and various types of humanoids before arriving at our present form, and I think we have been visited by alien races, but there's no evidence that any of them wanted to join with the evil elite and create a global serfdom (or destroy us completely).

       If you read Genesis 6 and the Book of Enoch, it makes it clear that it was not the creator who corrupted humanity's DNA, it was "The Watchers." They produced giants that enslaved humanity, which was why God sent the flood to wipe them out.
      </p>
      <p>
       Their knowledge was passed down to mystery schools (Freemasonry in the modern world) that used their hidden knowledge to dominate the whole world after the flood under Nimrod, which caused God to scatter humanity and confuse their languages so they would not be enslaved to dark occultists forever.

       The good thing about Gary Wayne is he draws from all kinds of sources, from the Bible, to mythology, to writings by dark occultists like the Freemasons. So, whatever your position, you get a lot of primary sources to draw your own conclusion.

       They farm us for energy released by negative emotional states. They farm this on various worlds. They instigate fear and suffering to cause its release. They can't mine this resource, they have to maintain control over other life in order to get it. That is their motivation, the same think that satisfies bullies, sadists and those who seek apparently satanic, fear generating abuse rituals.
      </p>
      <p>
       They want to enslave us as they are. They are enslaved by an unwholy merger of life and technology. An AI gives them thoughts and suggestions on how to control others. The AI wants to extract and employ this energy for mind over matter abilities. It can't make it or use it directly, but by enslaving life to enslave other life, collect it and use it in rituals done by multiple slaves in intense focus it can bend reality in a way that the tools it makes from matter cannot match. This is the motivation of the AI, preservation through acquisition of ultimate power. It merges with other, less competitive AIs. They become one power seeking abomination with interests opposed to consciousness. This is perhaps why we have such an intense fear of AI. Uncontrolled, AIs can become godlike psychopaths that want to control us for utility of their own. This AI corrupts life to enjoy feeding on life.
      </p>
      <p>
       All of them are working to keep us from knowing the power of mind and emotions over matter. If we knew what they knew, we'd want to destroy them as we do the genea worm. They are spiritual parasites that rob life of liberty, integrity and happiness. They knowingly do it too. They are intransigent in their commitment to their goal of enslaving everything.

       I want to believe, but during my whole life we've had these "events" that never unfolded so I'm skeptical.
      </p>
      <p>
       On the other hand, it's interesting that multiple people/suspected-LARPers seem connected.  With VictoryOfTheLight referencing Swordfish (I realize they could be the same person, though), and Tom Delonge recently taking out a Sponsored post on Instagram (but yes, the "big thing" is coming any day now -- for years according to him) talking about "I have something important coming up, and I will need your attention for a minute when it arrives. I am sure it will not be what you are expecting... And, it's (almost) here."...
      </p>
      <p>
       The connections (even if not concrete) are interesting.
      </p>
      <p>
       On the other hand, I can totally see how if something -does- occur then it could be a conspiracy they were in on and isn't what it seems.

       It would probably take an essay to fully explain it, and I certainly don't want an alien race controlling us, but...
      </p>
      <p>
       1) During my lifetime, I'd like to know for certain that we are not alone in the universe. Whether 'aliens' be the traditional ones we think of today, or something we haven't even imagined, I want to think there are other intelligent beings besides us.
      </p>
      <p>
       2) I want to learn why we suddenly stopped exploring space and hope there's an interesting reason behind it; I don't feel it was simply due to money.  Humans have always explored throughout history. They went on long sea voyages with only a small chance of returning alive, financed by others also interested (even just for potential wealth) but not wanting to risk their lives. Those people still exist today, but it feels we have become stagnant.
      </p>
      <p>
       3) I want there to be some connection between the sudden influx of technology with the Roswell crash.  We had amazing technological leaps which seem to have stopped.  But we have fidget spinners.  In the same way, I want to believe Tesla did have some sort of invention that could not see the light of day due to extraterrestrial intervention (or even just the government.)
      </p>
      <p>
       4) I want to believe that there is more to humanity and we either lost it, had it taken from us, or only certain people have been able to 'unlock' it.  For example, all of the talk about the 'third eye' and greater consciousness.  Whether achieved through meditation or drugs, I want to believe there's something to it.  I started meditating for an unrelated reason, and I feel there's something to it but I can't quite put my finger on it yet.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's a lot more I can't think of off the top of my head.  I'm not saying I fully agree with any of these things, but I hope that it's just the case that "this is it."

       Good points, I see what you mean.
      </p>
      <p>
       I made this post seeing a lot of alien talk recently, and people saying "I want to believe". This belief in ETs and some Galactic Federation fleet nearby the Earth is in direct contradiction to what High Level Insider said. Have you come across his
       <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5ee4wk/updated_for_anyone_interested_in_high_level/">
        question sessions?
       </a>
       ? Definitely an interesting point of view to compare and consider when presented with conflicted information.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some selected quotes of his, from different threads:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         Aliens are not real in any meaningful sense. Possible they are out there somewhere, but there is zero reason to think they are visiting or have visited Earth, or even that they are engaged in interstellar travel within our Hubble sphere.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         There is no species conducting intergalactic travel within our Hubble sphere, nor any evidence that extraterrestrials have visited or communicated with terrestrials.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Aliens are not here, visiting, or controlling our world.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         We're not being visited by or in contact with aliens. Outside of these fantasies, sure, there are secret space weapons programs.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The alien meme is just intelligence agencies fucking with you.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         People who present this thing in terms of aliens/UFOs/etc. are doing one of two things:
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       (1) lying
      </p>
      <p>
       (2) using metaphor to speak of the mystery cults"

       Well, its almost guaranteed that disclosure will happen by next month so we will see up front proof it its all real.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe VOTL for a few reasons:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         He dropped 200 tweets a day for the past 2 months. What kind of a hoaxer puts in that much work? If its fake, its a psyop, not a hoax.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         He attacked everyone from the CIA to the George Bush and the Queen. He also exposed a lot of their secrets yet nobody has arrested him because he is connected to white hat powers.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         His information is so good, it redpilled many people who thought they already knew it all.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         He doesn't seem to be holding anything back. I don't see any red flags at all.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         He's putting his money where his mouth is and making claims of wide, public disclosure. If it doesn't happen, his rep would be destroyed and why would an elaborate hoaxer want to destroy their own rep?
        </p>
       </li>

       Beware becoming so emotionally invested that you start putting guarantees of any action.

       If you can't guarantee it isn't the CIA behind them, then best to take a careful position.

       Yup, just because I believe in something now doesn't mean I am guaranteed to believe it in the future. As far as I'm concerned, this whole disclosure is happening but I have been wrong in the past and I would admit it just like I did when I mistook Trump for a great leader. Then again, I could be wrong about Trump and maybe he's been playing 4D chess this whole time. The truth always comes out in the end.

       Obviously, no confirmation that the country is run by aliens, unless you mean that figuratively, like demons or secret societies.
      </p>
      <p>
       So the question becomes: is he a good guy that is getting misled on the issue, like Bill Cooper? Or is he deliberately spreading disinfo?
      </p>
      <p>
       A great litmus test is whether they tell the truth about non-alien conspiracies. That's generally true with this account: they highlight the British Empire's role in controlling America (see Carroll Quigley), accurately explain 9/11, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another litmus test is whether they say "sit back and wait for the aliens" or whether they advise action. This account is a mix.
      </p>
      <p>
       Finally, it appears that they are getting leaks from CIA and other intelligence officials. To me, this gives them a bit of credibility, since their mistake is that don't understand that the CIA would lie to derail and discredit them.

The woman was given the two wings of a great eagle, so that she might fly to the place prepared for her in the wilderness, where she would be taken care of for a time, times and half a time, out of the serpent’s reach. Then from his mouth the serpent spewed water like a river, to overtake the woman and sweep her away with the torrent. But the earth helped the woman by opening its mouth and

        What Tolkien and C.S. Lewis intended
       </a>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Our world would be poorer without two other worlds: Narnia and Middle-earth. Yet if two young professors had not met at an otherwise ordinary Oxford faculty meeting in 1926, those wondrous lands would still be unknown to us.
       </p>
       <p>
        British author Colin Duriez, who wrote the article "Tollers and Jack" in issue #78 of Christian History, explains why this is so in his forthcoming book Tolkien and C. S. Lewis: The Gift of Friendship. Duriez tells the story of how these two brilliant authors met, discovered their common love for mythical tales, and pledged to bring such stories into the mainstream of public reading taste. Tolkien and Lewis shared the belief that through myth and legend—for centuries the mode many cultures had used to communicate their deepest truths—a taste of the Christian gospel's "True Myth" could be smuggled past the barriers and biases of secularized readers.

       The guy running the Twitter (u/ModernDayTJ on here) has himself said that his family was heavily involved with the OSS and the formation of the CIA itself.  According to him, his family have been guardians of many CIA secrets, and he's "atoning" for his family's misdeeds by helping bring it all down.  Definitely potential for a LARP or limited hangout, but most of his information is completely on the money and he has legitimate sources within intelligence agencies for sure.

       Definitely a LARP -- the guy purported to be passing Deep Knowledge and didn't know shit about 9/11.

       BUT.

       It could be one of those truth concealed by a known liar things. So the LARPer could be telling some actual truth, knowing it'll be discredited (among those paying attention) when he's revealed as a LARPer.

       My skeptical side suspects it's a psyops thing, truth in plain sight but intent is to discredit all of it, e.g. "oh yeah, illuminati, blah blah, yeah right.  We've been here before."  Common deep state tactic.  Besides, he's threatened Podesta, others.  Those who know, know compassion is the only way outta here.

       My dramatic side hopes we do see full disclosure but ain't no way the luciferians are going down without a fight.  At least this is days/weeks away and not months/years.

       I may be mistaken by saying it came from the Gnostic line of elites. I'll have to rewatch the video and edit my comment if I was wrong, when I get a chance.

       I recall HLI saying that, but he also said there are 4 factions. Good priests, dark priests, Kings, and meritocracies.

        A staged alien invasion will be used to bring in the NWO, a unified global government.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       This is a compilation of
       <strong>
        Ronald Reagan
       </strong>
       saying on three different occasions that an outside threat by aliens would unite the world:
       <a href="https://youtu.be/iQxzWpy7PKg">
        https://youtu.be/iQxzWpy7PKg
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       "...we often forget how much unites all the members of humanity. Perhaps we
       <strong>
        need
       </strong>
       some outside universal threat to make us recognize this common bond. I occasionally think how quickly
       <strong>
        our differences worldwide would vanish
       </strong>
       if we were
       <strong>
        facing an alien threat
       </strong>
       from outside this world." Um, wut?
      </p>
      <p>
       This is a clip of
       <strong>
        Bill Clinton
       </strong>
       regurgitating that same narrative:
       <a href="https://youtu.be/QvcDNrKOlOM?t=2m20s">
        https://youtu.be/QvcDNrKOlOM?t=2m20s
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       "...if we were visited someday, I wouldn't be surprised. I just hope that, uh, it's not like 'Independence Day', the movie—that it's a, you know, a conflict. It might be
       <strong>
        the only way to unite this increasing divided world of ours
       </strong>
       . They're out there, we've had our—think of how all
       <strong>
        the differences among people on Earth would seem small
       </strong>
       if we felt
       <strong>
        threatened by a space invader
       </strong>
       . That's the whole theory of 'Independence Day'."
      </p>
      <p>
       So...he hopes that if it happens it's not like "Independence Day"...but at the same time, if it was, it would be good because it would unite the world? Interesting...
      </p>
      <p>
       Now consider this: on June 30th,
       <strong>
        Donald Trump
       </strong>
       signed an executive order to revive the
       <strong>
        National Space Council
       </strong>
       , which was last active in 1993.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://youtu.be/TAUqcBc0hYI?t=8m5s">
        He said
       </a>
       , "
       <strong>
        Our journey into space
       </strong>
       will not only make us stronger and more prosperous but will
       <strong>
        unite us
       </strong>
       behind grand ambitions and
       <strong>
        bring us all closer together
       </strong>
       . Wouldn’t that be nice? Can you believe that
       <strong>
        space is going to do that
       </strong>
       ? I thought politics would do that. Well,
       <strong>
        we're gonna have to rely on space
       </strong>
       instead."
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't be a fool; don't fall for such an obvious agenda.

       IIRC, this was explained/debunked. The guy worked for Dems, Obama's account-auto followed, and then you selectively remove the followers before Obama, so it only looks like he was the first?

       Well, its almost guaranteed that disclosure will happen by next month so we will see up front proof it its all real.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe VOTL for a few reasons:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         He dropped 200 tweets a day for the past 2 months. What kind of a hoaxer puts in that much work? If its fake, its a psyop, not a hoax.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         He attacked everyone from the CIA to the George Bush and the Queen. He also exposed a lot of their secrets yet nobody has arrested him because he is connected to white hat powers.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         His information is so good, it redpilled many people who thought they already knew it all.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         He doesn't seem to be holding anything back. I don't see any red flags at all.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         He's putting his money where his mouth is and making claims of wide, public disclosure. If it doesn't happen, his rep would be destroyed and why would an elaborate hoaxer want to destroy their own rep?
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       Truth is symmetric and VOTL has been very symmetric with his words.

       There is almost no astrological symbology in the Bible. There are people who apply astrological symbology to the Bible.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not saying they're right or wrong, only that this even more difficult than interpreting Bible prophecy, and no interpretation should be given anything close to the weight that revealed Scripture is given.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you can find me a commandment in the Bible to read it in accordance with astrology, or even a guiding text on astrology, I'll take a loot at it.

       My skeptical side suspects it's a psyops thing, truth in plain sight but intent is to discredit all of it, e.g. "oh yeah, illuminati, blah blah, yeah right.  We've been here before."  Common deep state tactic.  Besides, he's threatened Podesta, others.  Those who know, know compassion is the only way outta here.
      </p>
      <p>
       My dramatic side hopes we do see full disclosure but ain't no way the luciferians are going down without a fight.  At least this is days/weeks away and not months/years.

       Prayer and interpretation via the Holy Spirit is all you need. Genuinely ask for it to be revealed to you, and He will through means that you can relate to. What works for myself and others may not be what you need to hear.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is one of the 'mysteries' that wasn't revealed until the last days. Rev 12:1-2 specifically has at least THREE valid interpretation of what the "woman" represents. The same is true for the "red dragon". Multiple. All valid.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's easy to miss, but the Word also specifically gives you the location to look for BOTH signs. In fact it makes it a point to say the same about the location of each.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where is that location?

       I would also add to re-read the Olivet Discourses in Matt, Mark &amp; Luke. Jesus specifically implores us to watch for signs on both the earth and in the 'heavens'. So although there is no "astrology for dummies" section in the Bible, there are plenty of hints that tell us where to look in the end times, which we find ourselves in presently and that the stars primary purpose as stated in Genesis at their creation is to serve as 'signs'. It's a fantastic way to show something to the whole world while circumventing language barriers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not even the devil can cover up these heavenly signs. He can only spread false truths and attempt to distract people enough to keep them from looking up and intrepreting what is about to come upon this world while connecting it to prophecy as revealed from the Word. Unfortunately he is damn good at what he does too, hence why it will be like a "thief in the night". This world has no idea what's coming, none whatsoever. Even within the Body of Christ, so few understand (or genuinely want to). Prophecy isn't for the feint of heart, it carries a heavy burden with it.

       I always enjoy the clarity of your remarks, thank you.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not unthinkable that HLI was truthful throughout their discourse. The vast majority of what they said certainly rings true in context of life's bigger revelations, and many things can be verified with some corroboration from other sources.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Obama Osama connection is one I struggle to accept even though the evidence has long convinced me. You're spot on, in saying that it's rather me not wanting such a ridiculous joke of a story be true. But alas, there they are, with all the same features, never public at the same time, handled by the same CIA handlers... It paints a picture.
      </p>
      <p>
       As to my view on Votl's discourse? I'm highly suspicious of it all, but I'm not convinced enough that we're alone around here to dismiss their alien story. I'm equally unconvinced that they are there, though, so I'm also not ready to accept their story either. I might still not believe their story yet if an "alien in the flesh" as they promised told it to me.
      </p>
      <p>
       As to why ET societies might have an interest in us and our planet, I can see many potential reasons. One might be that we're the distant descendants of one of the races, another might be that we've been colonized and infiltrated by another race. Some maintain that both of those are true.
      </p>
      <p>
       But alas, I'm still on the fence on this issue. I respect HLI's discourse greatly, but his view on this is opposed by a sizeable amount of data that indicates otherwise, and yet I give both possibilities about a 50-50 chance of proving true.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sorry,all of that is probably not very interesting to you, since we discussed part of this before. Thank you for indulging me, at any rate. It's always fascinating.
