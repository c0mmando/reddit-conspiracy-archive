       Russian military and political presence in Iraq would bring balance to the whole Middle Eastern and North African region, Nouri al-Maliki, the Iraqi vice-president, said during his visit to Moscow.
      </p>
      <p>
       It’s well known that Russia has historically strong relations with Iraq, therefore we would like Russia to have a substantial presence in our country, both politically and militarily,” al-Maliki said during his meeting with the speaker of Russia’s upper house of parliament, Valentina Matviyenko.

       What are the current relations between Iraq and Iran? I remember reading a while back that Iran was helping them with ISIS. Would be very interesting to see them rebuild relations considering the 1m+ Iranians that died during the war just a few decades ago. I still hate the turks for what happened 100+ years ago

       From what I've been reading about Iraq is that they're tired of the US which is why they want the switch. Especially when Iraq took Mosul but I guess the US tried to take credit for it and tried to say if we're leave this will happen again kind of shit. Plus they hate the "Reconstruction of their country" that we're doing

       Iraq is virtually a protectorate of Iran at this point. The Obama and Bush administration were so woefully incompetent that they allowed Iraq - of all places - to fall within the Shia sphere of influence.
      </p>
      <p>
       The majority of the population is Shia. The militias that run Baghdad and keep the surrounding regions relatively secure are Shia. And the key decision makers in government are Shia.

       iran and russia have mutual aid treaties with each other. they have for years.

       if either is attacked, the other must come to the aid of the other. russia and china also have mutual aid treaties.

       all NATO signatories are bound by the mother of all mutual aidvtreaties, article 5.

       WW1 was a war caused by mutual aid treaties. as one country attacked the other it drew in new countries:

       How do you know it wasn't happening?  Think about it from the Iraqi perspective.  Someone came in to save them and made their life worse.  Now they have an embassy that is really a military base, and just want to look at alternatives.

       I swear, our government is ran by a bunch of satanic 6 year olds. How can we spend hundreds of billions of dollars making a country like Iraq friendly to US interests, only to let Russia come behind us and take it? How does this happen?

       Of course they did. You think we didn't know they were attempting to get cozy with Iraqi leaders? We did, and we should have taken the necessary precautions to avoid such a scenario. The possibilities for souring the Iraqi/Russian relationship are endless for a country like the US. We could probably convince the Iraqis that Russia intends to nationalize their oil reserves if we felt like it. When we lose allies, it's because we let them go.

       U.S. loses because of poor foreign policy. U.S. foreign policy is "you are either an ally that will do what we say, or we will bomb you, your choice". Iraw was invaded by America years ago, and you wonder why they want no business with the U.S. By definition you can't be a sovereign nation if you are an American ally, due to America imposing its will on you., this is why America isn't ally of Russia because Russia won't bow down to America, Russia won't do what they want.

       It doesn't matter if our foreign policy was to give every man, women, and child in the middle east AIDS- we have the resources to not only manage the fallout, but to see it through. You keep saying "they don't like us for obvious reasons", but that's only because our image, and the way in which we conducted our operations, was highly neglected. If we wanted to build an army to destroy Libya and Syrian, and whoever else, we should have done it in a way that didn't risk losing everything we've thus far gained, and we easily could have.

       What? Sounds like you're thinking with your emotions, and not your head. US imperialism has been more successful than any other form of government on this world. The only reason it's failing is because of absolute greed, rather than measured greed. I care for all people of the world, but I care for Americans before everyone else. I happen to believe in Capitalism.

       This is big news, but just part of a bigger picture. The US's schizophrenic behaviour of the last few months has seen Turkey turn their back on their back on the US and link up with Russia - a historic foe for centuries. This shows how bad Washington has played this game in Syria. Turkey, Syria, Iraq and Iran are all pro-Russia.

       What no one understands about Iraq specifically, is that the US has been openly encouraging the local government bodies in southern Iraq to secede from Iraq to be part of the new Kurdistan.
      </p>
      <p>
       Iraqi central government leaders have been warning the US to cease doing this for months now. They have made public statements saying "no part of Iraq will leave Iraq". Our media has given it zero coverage.
