<p>It’s well known that Russia has historically strong relations with Iraq, therefore we would like Russia to have a substantial presence in our country, both politically and militarily,” al-Maliki said during his meeting with the speaker of Russia’s upper house of parliament, Valentina Matviyenko.</p>

We did, and we should have taken the necessary precautions to avoid such a scenario. The possibilities for souring the Iraqi/Russian relationship are endless for a country like the US. We could probably convince the Iraqis that Russia intends to nationalize their oil reserves if we felt like it. When we lose allies, it&#39;s because we let them go.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What? Sounds like you&#39;re thinking with your emotions, and not your head. US imperialism has been more successful than any other form of government on this world. The only reason it&#39;s failing is because of absolute greed, rather than measured greed. I care for all people of the world, but I care for Americans before everyone else. I happen to believe in Capitalism.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is big news, but just part of a bigger picture. The US&#39;s schizophrenic behaviour of the last few months has seen Turkey turn their back on their back on the US and link up with Russia - a historic foe for centuries. This shows how bad Washington has played this game in Syria. Turkey, Syria, Iraq and Iran are all pro-Russia. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What no one understands about Iraq specifically, is that the US has been openly encouraging the local government bodies in southern Iraq to secede from Iraq to be part of the new Kurdistan.</p>

<p>Iraqi central government leaders have been warning the US to cease doing this for months now. They have made public statements saying &quot;no part of Iraq will leave Iraq&quot;. Our media has given it zero coverage.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The US is doing the same with Syrian Kurds, and this is not just pissing off Damascus, but Ankara as well. The US wants to carve off Eastern Syria/Iraq for that stupid natural gas pipeline which they will screw Russia.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah...it&#39;s the Ceyhan pipeline..the Kirkuk-Ceyhan. Starts in Kirkuk, Iraq. </p>

<p>Runs through southern Turkey.</p>

<p>About Turkey...even Putin understands Erdogan can&#39;t be trusted.</p>

<p>Too much of a wild card.</p>

<p>If Russia does go into Iraq it will probably ensure the completion of the &quot;Friendship Pipeline&quot;.</p>
