       From what I've heard the real deal is staring at the sun to get energy straight from it. Supposedly other highly-spiritual people survive just off air. Generally speaking the case seems to be simply not eating certain things (like meat or fluoride). I have no actual answer that I assume you're expecting though.

       Hey I'm no sun-gazer. Supposedly you start by doing it every day for like ten seconds, at dusk and at dawn when it's safe, and you build up a sort of tolerance for it. I don't think they ever actually look directly at the sun (but I could be wrong).

       My perfect diet is eating whatever i want in responsible portions and maintaining an active life style. I love to eat ribs, tri-tip, pizza, and chili cheese fries. That's my perfect diet. I can't forget to mention you taking high quality vitamins if you choose my diet. My vitamin of choice is Orange Triad.

       Sadly this is not the answer. The above poster may still be relatively healthy in terms of their body composition. But the OP asked about the diet that provided the clearest state of mind. So this posters eats ribs, tri-tip, and pizza, which all have sugar in them (BBQ sauce etc.). So it's likely he has never been clean and free from sugar for a 6 month period. He likely thinks he has a clear state of mind because he wakes up everyday and is still able to operate, but the old adage of "you don't know what you don't know applies here." If he has never experienced life without sugar, how could he ever know what your state of mind is like off of it?

       You don't know a clear state of mind until you eat chili cheese fries with sour cream, guac, and hot sauce next to buffalo chicken sandwich with blue cheese crumbles. Eat that combination just once and tell me it doesn't provide you a clear state of mind. BTW I don't sauce my ribs or my tri-tip. Sugar isn't evil when eaten in proportions. Why are you trying to push your indoctrinating diet on people? Your anti sugar diet is the only good one because you believe it to be? Nothing brightens up your day more than a scoop of amazing ice cream, everyone loves ice cream. Why do you push this agenda. I'm not telling people to engorge themselves but instead show a self restraint in terms of how much you eat and make sure to eat plenty of nutrition. I get all my blood work done once every two years and according to my doctor my body is healthy and according to me my mind is in a clear state.
      </p>
      <p>
       tldr; You know whats not a clear state of mind? Thinking that only your diet is the right one and other people cannot have a clear state of mind because they have not tried my method.

       No sorry prolix, sugar is an addictive psychotropic drug and unless you have been clean from it for 6 months the body will not have had enough time to completely process it out of your body. I know that it is probably a favorite food of yours to have in moderation but that doesn't make it any less of a psychotropic drug and it doesn't mean it's any less addicting than any other mind altering substance. It's also likely that you've never known what it is like to not have refined sugar for an entire 6 month period because it is so culturally ubiquitous. So the old adage of "you can't possible know what you don't know applies here." It's not that I think my diet is right or wrong, it's that I'm accepting the fact that sugar is a psychotropic substance and a drug and that any single bit, like a hit of cocaine, or a hit of heroin, has an effect, and that is because you have never not known what it's like to be on sugar that it's not accurate for you to claim that it doesn't have any effects. Once again, the original poster didn't ask about the most nutritious diet, or the most balanced diet, or the one that is not so difficult to follow. It has nothing to do with restraint or moderation. He asked for the diet that gives the "clearest possible mind." That would mean removing all PSYCHOTROPIC DRUGS, of which sugar is one. I know that this is likely a concept you are unfamiliar with considering the culture we were raised in and are intrinsically a part of. But you can not possibly know the effects of not eating a single molecule of sugar unless you try it for the period of at least 6 months, then try having a single bite of sugar and see what it does to your frame of mind. Once again, it hasn't nothing to do with blood work and being healthy, and of course you think that your state of mind is clear because you've never experienced anything different. You've never been off our culture's favorite drug for long enough to experience what it is like to not be on it. If you have looked out a foggy window your whole life, and have never seen through a clear window before, you would not even know what the difference is, foggy would seem "clear" to you. But please, don't take this as an attack on you, eat as much or as little sugar as you want I don't care and you certainly don't have to believe me, but don't push it as "sugar in moderation is perfectly OK for having the clearest possible state of mind that a human can possibly achieve" because it is not true in the slightest and you don't have the necessary experience to claim this because in all likely hood you have never experience what it is like to have not been on the drug known as sugar for 6 months, 1 year, or more. That involves reading every ingredient and being hyper vigilant in what you put in your mouth.

       Lol moderate mounts of sugar are completely fine. Even added sugars. Obviously you dont want 50+ grams of added sugar daily. While yes its not ideal, the sugar scare is also over blown the same way fats were decades ago. The impact moderate amounts of added sugar daily is negligible on your health when you take into consideration of activity level, quality of sleep, stress levels, overall diet. etc. Then genetics come into play and some people have a more adverse reaction with sugars in general.

       Once again, this has nothing to do with health or being healthy or being fit. You can be perfectly fit and have some sugar once again and that's fine whatever it's OK. But don't think for a second that it's not a psychotropic drug that has a very marked effect on consciousness. As much as any other drug, pot, cocaine, opiate, etc. Just because you have lived in a culture saturated by the drug sugar and have never been off it for a period of 6 months, let alone a week probably (considering 80% of the grocery store has it in one form or the other). To claim they are "completely fine" to be included in a diet that creates the "clearest state of mind" to exist is false, and just a justification for using your favorite drug. You can't possibly know what you don't know, so until you are completely refined sugar free for 6months - 1year, you cannot possibly know how clear your state of mind can become, even a single bite can have an effect that lasts for weeks on the mind, with the majority of symptoms lasting roughly 4 hours. If you don't think it's addictive, then try not having a single molecule of sugar for even a week (fruit is OK, as the sugar is bound up in the chemistry of the fruit fibers.) Read every ingredient, nothing ending in -ose is allowed, no syrups, no organic cane sugar, no agave, nothing. Until you have followed a diet like this for roughly 6 months, for all the sugar to clear out of your system, then you can't possibly know what it's like to have a state of mind on a diet like this, because you have never not had sugar for the entirety of your life.

       Seriously some of you love to twist words to create some argument to do what? Spark upvotes? Its pathetic. Quit while your ahead, proper reading comprehension will take you a long way.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ofcourse excessive sugar is bad. Excess of anything could be bad. And I agree super markets are full of shit foods with a bunch of additives, but again, knowing proper nutrition you can avoid this and easily work around it.  Genetics strongly come into play as well with how your mind and body react to foods, and still people prefer to ignore this fact. Its a fact you can be healthy with sugar in your diet if you don't lack other important nutrients like fiber for instance.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also if you're gonna make conspirator claims on sugar and its effects on consciousness, at least post some studies on this. Although I'm sure like anything, it effects the brain, but for weeks? Seriously I love conspiracy theories.
      </p>
      <p>
       "fruit is OK, as the sugar is bound up in the chemistry of the fruit fibers.) "
      </p>
      <p>
       No. Just say fiber. Like I have been clearly saying. Having fiber defeats the problem of insulin issues with sugar. Sugar is sugar, there are different compounds of it yes, the end result is the same when fiber is included.
      </p>
      <p>
       And if you're gonna be egotistical you can just stop there, my state of mind is fine, I can thank mindfulness meditation for that, not me cutting out added sugar for the last two years, besides icecream. For future reference, dont make assumptions about someone, especially on the internet. Defeats any future argument you think you have.

       Avoid pesticides. Even organic foods are only tested once, to get organic certification, and never tested again. Pesticide drift  goes from non-organic fields into the organic fields and gets on supposedly "organic" produce. And water containing pesticides flows downstream from non-organic farms, and that water is used on organic farms.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only solution is to grow all your own food, very carefully.

       Depending on where you live you're bound to get sprayed. Here in rural Arkansas chemical drift is outrageous. Right now everywhere you look there is Dicamba damage. Gardens, yards, non-dicamba soybeans. Plant Board did an emergency ban on it to stop it from completely destroying the soybean crop. However Monsanto is lobbying and trying to get it allowed next year.

       A balanced one. None of this mostly plants BS. Japan has the highest life expectancy and its partly due to their balanced diet. They don't overeat and they don't consume a lot of sugar. Typical Japanese meal is bowl of rice, some protein (beef, chicken, pork, fish) and a side of vegetables.

       There are 2 options for food (excluding water); plants and meat. If not mostly plants, then the only other option is mostly meat.. I don't think that's the right one.

       Perfect diet that allows the clearest state of mind:
      </p>
      <p>
       Well first, you must establish what is a "clear state of mind" and if they advice you are taking from people is coming from someone who actually has a "clear state of mind." How can you tell? Is there such thing that is a diet that is good for your health but still doesn't allow you to have the most optimized state of mind. Does anyone you know have extraordinary mental abilities?
      </p>
      <p>
       How do you test if you have a clear state of mind? Meditate. If you can hold an idea in your head for 10 minutes, 20 minutes, 1 hour. It's probably pretty clear. If you can only last a few seconds before something pops up it's likely your mind it not clear at all. The first thing is to get off all psychotropic substances, no caffeine, no sugar, no marijuana, no alcohol, no preservatives, no medication that actively adjusts the brain's chemistry. You must be clean for roughly 6 months.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then like a scientist you must test each individual food you eat. Get yourself into a meditative state, clear mind, eat a small bite of a food you are testing, and see how it effects the state of your mind, the quality of your consciousness, the focus of your intent. Then, try another food the next day.
      </p>
      <p>
       You must understand the point of "you don't know what you don't know" and how this applies to everyone. Mostly everyone will say "I have a clear state of mind, it's always been like this, I can think and process clearly." The truth is, you have no clue whether or not your mind is actually clear, we have all been addicted to sugar since nearly our birth, getting birthday cakes shoved in our face. It's likely that 99% of the population has never not had sugar for a 3-month period. They can't possibly know what it's like. You don't know what you don't know. You must test vigorously for years. Don't believe anyone, don't disbelieve anyone, stay SKEPTICAL and OPEN MINDED. Test test test. Experiment. Try to kick all the substances I mentioned above, that's a good first start.

        Genesis 1:29-30
       </strong>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Then God said, “Behold! I have given you every seed-bearing plant throughout the earth and all the fruit trees for your food. And I have given every green plant as food for all the wild animals, the birds in the sky, and the small animals that scurry along the ground—everything that has life.”

       <strong>
        Daniel 1:8-16
       </strong>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Daniel was determined not to defile himself by eating the food and wine given to them by the king. He asked the chief of staff for permission not to eat these unacceptable foods. Now God had given the chief of staff both respect and affection for Daniel.
        <br/>
        But he responded, “I am afraid of my lord the king, who has ordered that you eat this food and wine. If you become pale and thin compared to the other youths your age, I am afraid the king will have me beheaded.”
        <br/>
        Daniel spoke with the attendant who had been appointed by the chief of staff to look after Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah.
        <br/>
        “Please test us for ten days on a diet of plants and water,” Daniel said. “At the end of the ten days, see how we look compared to the other young men who are eating the king’s food. Then make your decision in light of what you see.”
        <br/>
        The attendant agreed to Daniel’s suggestion and tested them for ten days. At the end of the ten days, Daniel and his three friends looked healthier and better nourished than the young men who had been eating the food assigned by the king. So after that, the attendant fed them [all] only plants instead of the food and wine provided [by the king].

       Help me out here. How does this work out for folks that live in regions with short summers? Did all of healthy humanity have access to a year round farmers market?

       Seriously some of you love to twist words to create some argument to do what? Spark upvotes? Its pathetic. Quit while your ahead, proper reading comprehension will take you a long way.

       Ofcourse excessive sugar is bad. Excess of anything could be bad. And I agree super markets are full of shit foods with a bunch of additives, but again, knowing proper nutrition you can avoid this and easily work around it.  Genetics strongly come into play as well with how your mind and body react to foods, and still people prefer to ignore this fact. Its a fact you can be healthy with sugar in your diet if you don't lack other important nutrients like fiber for instance.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also if you're gonna make conspirator claims on sugar and its effects on consciousness, at least post some studies on this. Although I'm sure like anything, it effects the brain, but for weeks? Seriously I love conspiracy theories.
      </p>

       "fruit is OK, as the sugar is bound up in the chemistry of the fruit fibers.) "
      </p>
      <p>
       No. Just say fiber. Like I have been clearly saying. Having fiber defeats the problem of insulin issues with sugar. Sugar is sugar, there are different compounds of it yes, the end result is the same when fiber is included.
      </p>
      <p>
       And if you're gonna be egotistical you can just stop there, my state of mind is fine, I can thank mindfulness meditation for that, not me cutting out added sugar for the last two years, besides icecream. For future reference, dont make assumptions about someone, especially on the internet. Defeats any future argument you think you have.
