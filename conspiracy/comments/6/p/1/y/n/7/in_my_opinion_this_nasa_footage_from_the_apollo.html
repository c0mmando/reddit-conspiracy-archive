       The following evidence represents an extremely important moment caught on camera that I believe has never been adequately addressed by NASA or any NASA supporter. In my opinion it is equivalent to what the “WTC7 collapsing” footage is to the 9/11 truth movement.
      </p>
      <p>
       It comes from the documentary “A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Moon” but I am not trying to convince anyone of anything from an obviously biased documentary. Be skeptical of all of it. I encourage that. When this clip plays in the documentary there is a narrator but, again, I am telling you to completely ignore that voiceover if it pleases you.
      </p>
      <p>
       Simply use your eyes and use your brain and look at what I am about to show you. I am purposely separating the most important footage from the documentary and its bias, muting the narrator, and breaking the clip up into very short digestible gifs.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lets start.
      </p>
      <p>
       Does this look like the Earth to you? Would you assume that this is a shot from the far reaches of space, looking back at Earth from a distance?
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://makeagif.com/gif/a-funny-thing-happened-on-the-way-to-the-moon-P6L-Aa">
        http://makeagif.com/gif/a-funny-thing-happened-on-the-way-to-the-moon-P6L-Aa
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Pretty convincing right? Lets look at more footage of “Earth at a distance”:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://makeagif.com/gif/a-funny-thing-happened-on-the-way-to-the-moon-2BRu4x">
        http://makeagif.com/gif/a-funny-thing-happened-on-the-way-to-the-moon-2BRu4x
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Zooming in the camera which we can only assume is pushed up against a shuttle window, pointed out at the Earth in the blackness of space:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://makeagif.com/gif/a-funny-thing-happened-on-the-way-to-the-moon-fnU3Ae">
        http://makeagif.com/gif/a-funny-thing-happened-on-the-way-to-the-moon-fnU3Ae
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Okay, this shot is even better. Notice that you cannot really make out any continents? Notice that you see no stars? But for the sake of argument, lets just completely ignore that for now. Take a look:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://makeagif.com/gif/a-funny-thing-happened-on-the-way-to-the-moon-xaWNX2">
        http://makeagif.com/gif/a-funny-thing-happened-on-the-way-to-the-moon-xaWNX2
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean, thats definitely the Earth right? And you would have to be far beyond Earth (on the way to the moon) to get footage like that, correct? Again, no recognizable continents, No stars. But again, for the sake of argument, lets allow science to explain that.
      </p>
      <p>
       But wait, how exactly does this happen?
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://makeagif.com/gif/a-funny-thing-happened-on-the-way-to-the-moon-TTDLgt">

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Wait, isn’t the camera pressed against the window and zoomed in?
      </p>
      <p>
       Because they are far from Earth right, at least this far, correct? If they zoomed that camera back out.
      </p>

      </p>
      <p>
       Hold on. Wut? Here is a longer gif just to make the strangeness very clear.

      </p>
      <p>
       Is that a… work light? Of enormous size and floating in space?
      </p>
      <p>
       Wait a minute, whats going on?
      </p>

      <p>
       So wait, what? Yeah, that “Earth at a distance” was a clever camera trick. They used the circular shuttle window and the small part of the enormous Earth showing through that small circular window. Camera tricks and the illusion of a little “Earth ball” at a distance.
      </p>
      <p>
       As you can see here, they are very close to Earth. Like “Low Earth Orbit” close. And yes, that was a work light. You can now see it clearly. And that blackness was a darkened shuttle interior. Again:

      </p>
      <p>
       Or… I don’t know. I am willing to entertain any ideas or thoughts on this.
      </p>
      <p>
       And let me set the record straight once and for all:
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you personally subscribe to any “Flat Earth” or “alternate Earth models”?— NO
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you believe in the ISS and Mars rover missions?— YES
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you believe that you can shine a laser at a retroreflector on the moon?— YES, because the unmanned soviet
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunokhod_programme">
        Lunokhod
       </a>
       program left retroreflectors there.
      </p>
      <p>
       What about the other evidence: moon rocks, etc…?— I am not sure honestly, I do not feel like I have studied enough to make a decision.
      </p>
      <p>
       So what are you trying to prove then?— I am simply pointing out that there is unusual footage of what appears to be the astronauts filming a disingenuous “Earth”. I find the footage fascinating and would love to know more about it. I would love to see the unedited footage and I would love to see the extended footage.
      </p>
      <p>
       How do we know this is real NASA footage?— Because NASA included it in their Apollo 11 DVD set. Why, I don’t know. But people definitely thought that pointing that out would somehow make my brain stop comprehending what it saw.
      </p>
      <p>
       As a matter of fact,
       <a href="http://www.clavius.org/bibsibrel.html">
        here is a website that appears to be trying to debunk that footage
       </a>
       , scroll to the bottom.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is their explanation:
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       What Mr. Sibrel supplies is footage of the astronauts practicing for an upcoming telecast.
       <strong>
        Because television was added at the last minute, they hadn't had time to practice much with the equipment. So they were experimenting with different camera positions and exposure settings
       </strong>
       . Someone on the ground recorded it. Mr. Sibrel notes several observations which he can't explain in terms of his expectations, therefore he concludes the astronauts "must" have been faking it. That's it. That's his "smoking gun."
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       And finally, here is
       <a href="https://youtu.be/xciCJfbTvE4?t=32m20s">
        the TIMESTAMPED section of “A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Moon”
       </a>
       if this post piqued your interest. Once again, take everything said by the narrator with a grain of salt. I am not trying to convince anyone of anything other than what their eyes see and the conclusions their brain reach while watching that particular footage that I made gifs from. I personally have a hard time wrapping my brain around what form of “context” could possibly explain it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thank you for reading and thank you to the thousands of people who left me hate mail yesterday and downvoted my comment to -700 when I attempted to point out this funny footage on a r/all front page post. Without you, I never would have spent an hour putting this together after work today.

       Thanks, I got a lot of flack yesterday for simply posting a timestamped link. I wanted to change that today.
      </p>
      <p>
       People were pretending that I was being downvoted to, no joke, -700 because I was just "dropping a link to a fraud's documentary". Even though I timestamped to the exact clip, people seemed to assume I wanted them to watch an hour+ documentary, so they refused to even click it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically everything was criticized except for the actual content of what I posted, nobody had anything to say about it. I assume because the majority didn't even bother to click and instead just continued to dog-pile on top of me as a social signal that they were also "against the crazy wacko".
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean, seriously, all I cared about was sharing something that I found interesting. Something that I felt most people had never seen and should at least be able to entertain watching. I was really, really, wrong. At least when dealing with the hordes of r/all.

       Looking on my phone, to me the first link is different from the other three, taken from further out in space and encompassing the whole planet.  The others are taken much closer and they're all angled to capture the edge of Earth, so you're looking through a longer cross section of the atmosphere so the cloud cover looks way too dense.

       I'm skeptical of the moon landing but I'm not sure what you mean about not ever seeing cloud coverage like that? It doesn't look unusual to me. And in case you're comparing what you see in the pic to your local weather radar, you should know weather radar detects precipitation, not necessarily clouds.

       The problem occurs when there's no basis for whether is a photo is "real" or "fake". But saying, "There is no land in these photos, so obviously they're fake", seems a lot more irrational than, "they wouldn't think to just add land into a photo they're faking, of a planet that literally everyone knows has land." I mean with the precision and detail that would go into making/faking that picture, how do you overlook something so simple as "it's Earth, it has land."

       "Adding land" to the photo would lead to the same effect that "adding stars" would add. It would give people an actual basis for mathematically calculating the accuracy of the photo. And number don't lie.

       The "accuracy" of the photo through math, how, and what for? The only thing I could think of would be that somehow someone would figure out that the size of the landmass isn't accurate compared to the altitude of the camera. But they would already need statistics of the camera's altitude and position, etc. Now, I don't know much about what NASA releases along with the photos (if they give out that sort of information, or not) but it seems to me they would be able to do the math themselves and A) make the landmass in the photo the correct size for the altitude, etc. of the camera, or B) if not, at least lie about the statistics of the camera to match the size of the landmass in your photo.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not strong enough to say they forgot the land, and to say they simply did not include it so people could not calculate the correct landmass size vs. altitude (because I'm not sure what else they could calculate from it that would prove anything) is also not very strong.
      </p>
      <p>
       It goes back to what is a "real" picture of the Earth from space, and how do you spot fakes?

       I got them all from NASA. From the same barrel. I encourage anyone to post an image of NASA. It's already proven they are all cgi. I'm just pointing out how bad some of them are to not even include land or natural weather patterns. And the spacewalks are utterly unscientific and all have some prop that has no function on a spaceship. Bunch of bullshit.  But like I said there is proof from the guy whose company creates the cgi backgrounds. He fucked up and slipped and now we heard it from the horse s mouth.

       Shiningn laser has nothing to do with this. We all agree a moon is in the sky.

       As far as land. In the fake Apollo pic there is more land than water. In the fake ISS backgrounds of earth there is not a hint of land in any of those.

       We never went to the moon in recent history. All fake. Everyone will see that soon enough.

       Though,  In ancient times man was there. There is alot to the moon and sun you don't understand yet. Space is something different than you think, and you won't know by trusting the lies of NASA. Expanding your consciousness will come with obstacles. One is letting go of indoctrination of a false paradigm that government education has programmed into our minds.

       In actuality, the round-trip time of about 2.5 seconds is affected by the location of the Moon in the sky, the relative motion of Earth and the Moon, Earth's rotation, lunar libration, weather, polar motion, propagation delay through Earth's atmosphere, the motion of the observing station due to crustal motion and tides, velocity of light in various parts of air and relativistic effects.[7] Nonetheless, the Earth–Moon distance has been measured with increasing accuracy for more than 35 years. The distance continually changes for a number of reasons, but averages 385,000.6 km (239,228.3 mi).

       The moon has very little gravitational pull and there's little if any 'space dust' that'd make it to the moon.

       Cool, these lunar mirrors imo have a lot of disinformation in the wiki alone.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm hard convinced anyone has been there at all , in the past century. The possibility of any object getting there, to me, is fiction. Impossible currently because we don't view space as it really is. It behaves different than we are taught. It's more connected to our minds , than it is to a rocket.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is a little ahead though, the connection of consciousness and space hasn't been made. Quantum is an attempt. But it's different than that. Our reality is layered as a reflection of our consciousness. Subjective layers would be more in tune with what space is. Dream or astral layers.
      </p>
      <p>
       But then you have to go back to what you are taught about origins. Big bang and evolution, and even genesis. Even those theories cloud our perception about 'the heaven's.
      </p>
      <p>
       So a lot of the reason we make no progress in space and after what..50 years have a mirror on the moon? Maybe?..   those are props. Real achievement is when we shift our understanding of consciousness to allow for the subjective reality to emerge. Then we will travel space easily.

       1) has no Land? Just clouds. And look at the tin foil thing with cones stuck in it. You think that was launched into space? Looks like a piece of junk.
      </p>
      <p>
       2) that's a painting. You can tell by the lines and especially in that black and white dotted area within the coast. That area gives it away. It is nothing but black and white brush strokes.
      </p>
      <p>
       3) what they did there was layer the foreground over a cut out of a globe Earth. What is that whit shell on the right, or east side of the earth? It's like a massive ice sheet or something. Clouds are convincing but really make no sense. All water again on that earth when in some of the other photos there is land across the whole hemisphere. They never can get that right. Inconsistent.
      </p>
      <p>
       4) all fake backgrounds of earth. It's not that hard to do. They have been getting better art cgi. Now that it's this good and we see how they go it , NASA looks like a joke. Their early footage is terribly done. But it convinced the nation blindly in awe of anything space related.

       Study landscape artists. It might help you see. You can zoom in on these also to see the brush strokes. Before computers the backgrounds were obviously paintings. Some of the images, like the op pointed out in a vid, are shots of the sky from low earth orbit, and then framed in a circle. So some are actual pictures of the sky they have just framed. Still fake though. If the fly were actually in space there would be no reason to use a painting of earth to deceive. No reason to frame the sky and call it a spinning earth.
      </p>
      <p>
       No reason to fake a whole ISS . Except to steal your money and keep you ignorant of your own reality so that you keep buying it.

       1) It's the northern hemisphere, so it's summer. The polar regions look covered in clouds. Ah, here is
       <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/alsj/a11/AS11-36-5321.jpg">
        another one
       </a>
       with Greenland visible. 
What do you mean by "disproportionate land"? How should it have looked instead?
      </p>
      <p>
       2) Somehow? Maybe they were in a space ship above the ISS?
       <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/alsj/a11/AS11-36-5293.jpg">
        The first shot outside
       </a>
       from Apollo 11 looks pretty similar. The camera is close to the surface and sees not the whole side of the earth, but only a slice. You've heard this before I'm sure.
      </p>
      <p>
       3) Cloud coverage like you see in countless pictures. We are close to the surface again. Also, the atmosphere appears cloudy, hazy and very blue, making it hard to see if there is land or sea below. Why would whatever the astronaut is doing be purposeless and unnecessarily dangerous? He's building a part of the space station. How else would it get built?
      </p>
      <p>
       4) Okay, you simply can't see half the globe, when you're flying at the height of the ISS. Max is like 140 degrees. And the image you posted only shows a small part of the globe, so you're totally not making any sense here.

       Even if you're not real, it could be instructive for others that have been fooled by cheap youtube parlor tricks.
      </p>
      <p>
       So you are still not convinced that you can't see the whole side of the earth from a height of 400 km, the earth having a radius of over 6000 km?
      </p>
      <p>
       It's pretty simple geometry actually, so just draw a sphere representing the earth, then draw a dot where the space station is, about a fifteenth of the circles radius from the edge of the circle. Should be a good exercise in perspective!

       The second-most interesting thing (in my opinion) from the "A Funny Thing Happened..." documentary, is the segment on how the moon landing was actually broadcast to the public.

       Watching the whole affair at the time was a big disappointment for me. After all I'd already seen Star Trek and 2001 A Space Odyssey and it all seemed so crude and primitive by comparison for what was supposed be such a huge technological advancement and achievement. Didn't occur to me at the time that it could have all been a hoax, but little by little it became obvious that it simply had to be and couldn't really be anything else. Moreover you feel pretty dumb looking back at the small goofy looking lander and suits they were wearing and wondering how you could ever believe that they could possibly sustain two human beings on something as utterly alien and hostile as the surface of the Moon. Dangers galore that were never really mentioned at all with the mission itself being presented with all the confidence and nonchalance of a Sunday picnic.

       This is retarded. Saying that NASA didn't make it to the moon is in parallel with saying the Earth is flat. Come on man, save yourself some time and accept that we went to the moon. I think its sad that people like you try to undermine the THOUSANDS of people who participated in the Apollo missions. Now WTC7 is interesting piece alone, but to make a correlation to the Apollo mission is quite silly.

       This post is just sprinkles on a big pile of evidence that has been coming out since the moon landings occurred. It's all genuinely interesting info. I find it very hard to imagine that you come here often and look into conspiracy and have to come across any of this other info. This conspiracy has countless tv shows. It as well known as the JFK assassination conspiracy theories.

       I think a healthy skeptic would ask "why does this footage look like this?"
      </p>
      <p>
       And then discover that camera footage from the 60s wasn't as good. Lighting in space is weird. Exposure on the film wasn't perfect. etc etc etc
      </p>
      <p>
       And maybe after actually learning about film technology from that era, and space photography, come to the conclusion that there isn't anything odd about that footage.
      </p>
      <p>
       And then maybe also take into context the fact that hundreds of thousands of people worked on the Apollo missions, and there is a literal mountain of evidence indicating that it was real.

       I mean really, what is so wrong with questioning the world around you? It's fun. It helps you either create a more sturdy foundation into what you believe or it might just change your mind. But either way, it is a great way to work out your brain as well as learn new opinions and information.

       Yes, my healthy and functional brain tried to absorb everything you've posted and it seems much less plausible then actually going to the moon. Do you not take into account that these people were using 1960s equipment to film? Film technology was created closer to the moon landing then we are now. It was quite primitive and you expect to see discernible continents and stars in the background? Have you seen the zapruder film? That was the most advanced film of the day and you can barely make out all the details from mere feet away.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm all for healthy skepticism, but this is quackery based, it would seem, on one documentary. I've studied this stuff for years, haven't seen one shred of evidence that makes me question the official story.

       If the moon landings were faked then man has never left LEO.
      </p>
      <p>
       If man has never left LEO then we cannot define the difficulty of "just going to the moon" because it would still be an unknown variable.
      </p>
      <p>
       For two variables to be compared X &gt; Y or X &lt; Y, the variables need to be defined.
      </p>
      <p>
       So it is illogical and meaningless to pose the question of whether it would be easier to go to the moon or easier to fake it.
      </p>
      <p>
       We know how easy it would be to fake it whether we went or not.

       But we obviously don't know how easy it would be to go whether we went or not.

       The fake moon landing theory is neither analogous to nor as outlandish as flat earth in my opinion.  Not only would a successful hoax have given a significant boost to national pride after the USSR beat the US into being first to space, but it would've egged the Soviet Union into dumping more of their budget into their space program, hastening their economic collapse.  Flat earth has no such remotely plausible human motive that I've heard, anyway.

       Yes, each subsequent Apollo mission success would've ratcheted up the pressure on the Russians and spurred them to increase their efforts in the space race.  This was a cold war between the world's two superpowers for what many believed to be future supremacy of the world.  The feasibility of a moon base was being evaluated at the time (google Project Horizon) which had serious military ramifications.  The paranoia surrounding the cold war and the limitless potential through establishing space supremacy created an environment where faking successful moon missions would've been extremely effective misinformation.

       I think the footage is legit shots of the earth from space. However, I think for cinematic effect and dramatic impact certain aspects of it and the moon landing were intentionally staged and some possibly even faked.
      </p>
      <p>
       I still believe the US landed on the moon, I just think everything we were shown was filtered and edited to be emotionally moving and convincing propaganda.

       Its really amazing that for every one person who actually notices what the footage shows, comprehends the obvious illusion, and then finds it interesting and revealing; there are 100 more who don't seem to have a clue what is going on, even though they are watching video evidence.

       Yes! Thats a great way to put it. I have shown this footage to lots of different people online and some really start twisting the mental gymnastics up to Olympic status.

       I find that aspect fascinating actually. The reaction of people to the footage is almost as interesting as the footage itself. A real window into how the human mind copes with new and possibly threatening information.

       OP here, I personally could believe this.
      </p>
      <p>
       At least I think this explanation makes more sense than "everything really happened the way it was shown, but we made some fake footage just in case".
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean, its not like if we passed LEO and found alien space stations that the government would simply say "Hey guys, lets tell the public what we found!".
      </p>
      <p>
       If human beings found out something like that, the world would devolve into complete chaos and anarchy, at least initially.

       That's pretty much my train of thought on it too. If we assume aliens are real, and assume they have some involvement with Earth, then running into them at the moon is plausible.

       The word anarchy is not the dirty word you are using it as. It simply means "no leader" it does not mean no rules or chaos.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just my two cents. People say I am arguing semantics but if our language is not clear how can we communicate properly?  Another fine example is the word theory. In science a theory means a lot more than just a wacky idea.  It is proven and tested and peer reviewed. Scientific theory is as close to fact as we can tell. The word we are supposed to use is hypothesis.

       The realisation that there are aliens on the moon would cause chaos(no rules) and anarchy(no leaders), as the aliens would delegitimise the governments etc. we have now.

       Don't really care why it was faked, not really into aliens or anything like that. I'm not opposed to any of it or that the moon is artificial etc, i just don't think that i'll find out about it in my lifetime, all space travel will be tightly fucking regulated, i reckon. If it's even possible.
      </p>
      <p>
       There must be something fairly important up there/down here if there's this much confusion surrounding it. My gut feeling is, some kind of advanced ancient, probably human, civilisation and the technology they've passed down.

       Yeah man, I could not believe that explanation either. I also cannot believe that anyone with a shred of sense would say "ok, case closed, they were just testing the equipment, so nothing unusual then".

       I am almost tempted to buy that Apollo 11 DVD set just to see if the footage is extended and to listen to NASA's direct explanation.

       I didn't know it was on an offish DVD, that makes it seem like they're doing/saying weird shit to confuse anyone who isn't a true believer.

       It's like at the end of Astronauts Gone Wild where whatsisname says he's gonna get the CIA to kill Sibrel. Hard to take something like that at face value really. Maybe i've just been taught to be tooo cynical.

       Don't know if you quite understood, but this is not space that you see. It is the black interior of a spacecraft. That isn't the Earth at a distance, its the window.

       Thats not a reflection. Its a lighting device on the inside of the darkened shuttle. It was intentionally cropped from the shots.

       Why is the acceleration curve unrealistic? Also the exhaust should be clear shouldn't it be, based on the chemical composition of the fuel they use in that stage, plus the fact the actual base piece that gets left behind is heating up, looks real to me?

       The hypergolic exhaust should be bright red, and is even depicted this way in NASA sketches of the process.

       There is no acceleration curve, that's why it's obviously fake. Low gravity or not, the thing wouldn't just spring up like that as if it's a cork popping out of a champagne bottle.

       There is an acceleration curve. I literally am watching the video slowed down, it does speed up. Initially it's fairly slow, but as it rises, and the camera starts to pan up, you see the gains in velocity.

       That is a real acceleration curve.... You fail to recognize that the pod is getting further away, and that adds a whole new dimension that's hard to recognize because of the lack of landmarks. Counting frames and oixels still shows its going up at an increasing rate. You think these guys are such chumps noone thought to out fake stars and lift it with a curve?

       That is a real acceleration curve.... You fail to recognize that the pod is getting further away, and that adds a whole new dimension that's hard to recognize because of the lack of landmarks. That and lower gravity and no air drag also make the acceleration curve less impact full. Counting frames and pixels still shows its going up at an increasing rate. You think these guys are such chumps noone thought to out fake stars and lift it with an increasing rate?

       The lack of stars is a different story entirely but also one that proves it was fake. Before you start warbling the tired tune about camera exposure settings, just give it a rest. I was talking to you because you made some comment, I thought, about being "open" to the hoax theory, not because I thought you were going to bend over backwards to make any excuse for NASA and their clumsy and pollyannish blunders.
      </p>

       There is no real acceleration curve; to the naked eye it is going no faster after 20 or 30 frames than when it first comically pops off of the descent module like a cap gun. This is of course only one aspect of why this footage is ridiculously fake, absurd, and goofy. But anyway, someone has been kind enough to calculate and illustrate this, proving that it is fake nonsense. Feel free to "debunk" this PhD, I guess.

       So what that tell us is that someone (E. Fendell) at Mission Control was sending predetermined instructions while looking at a stop watch and not at a TV screen. I have no reason to doubt Fendell's credibility, he would not have been party to any fraud nor knew anything about it. He followed his script and then admired the results afterwards. However the fact that he followed a script while looking at a stopwatch doesn't really add anything to the credibility of this hokey looking footage.

       The amount of delay was known. So all they had to do was listen to the countdown and compensate for delay.
      </p>
      <p>
       Once you reach the compensated countdown amount, start moving the camera and hope for the best - Which is why the camera doesn't perfectly track the launch, but it's still pretty good.

       Or that could just pip a radio signal and have the camera follow it. A technology that was nearly 20 years old at that point. Why over complicate things. We weren't in the dark ages in1972.

       That top part of the lunar lander shot up in the air and docked with the other ship that was orbiting the moon? So, when it, (which needed to be shot off with fuel from the surface), got near the ship..it just started hovering around the other orbiting ship until they could easily dock with it? I mean it had to somehow stop next to the other  ship at some point...from the looks of the video it just shot up.
      </p>
      <p>
       And executed by people (or anyone else) who never did that before? They technically would have only one shot at doing it. If the launch from the moon surface didn't go right and/or they can't maneuver the docking process, (again, which they never actually did before), their oxygen supply is now limited. (They sure had plenty of it to hop around all day on the moon.)

       Such a maneuver has never been done but like you said we are supposed to believe that these three nimrods did it on the first try. This is so complex and difficult of a maneuver most people can't even appreciate that. Think about how precise the timing would have to be...... with zero margin of error.
      </p>
      <p>
       The docking mechanism is depicted as sort of a rod that clicks into a slot on the other craft while in orbit, locking them together. You might remember that scene from Apollo 13. It's just another penis joke, probably.

       Exactly, FFS!. Yet people are going to come on here and throw some BS science/physics as the answer.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is all dependent on the fact that the ship that was orbiting around the moon had to be in such a position to be nearby.environment.. did the other ship drift of course, did the lunar lander not behave correctly floating up miles into space?
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not Star Trek, where they can just fly around and find the ship. That's a tiny ship with limited, if any, fuel left.
      </p>
      <p>
       Plus, when they departed down to the moon, they just undocked it and neatly went straight down?

       The difficulty I have with that, besides the cheap look of the footage, is while the two were walking around on the moon the one astronaut is floating at the base ship in the moon atmosphere. Then the lunar module just flies up to him and easily docks with the base ship.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then they "slingshot" into the moon's gravity to propel the ship towards earth at thousands of miles per hour to make their Earth target with accurate navigation, adequate fuel, etc. in only 4 days?
      </p>
      <p>
       I've read the explanation of the process but it just doesn't seem plausible, especially executed by only three people. And, if actually possible, so much could (should) go wrong.

       Exactly. If it was that easy in the 1960s, they would be going to the moon every week now in 2017. The Apollo hoax is self evident. If you think of rocket payloads and propellant ratio required. Houston, we have a problem with the moonlanding fiction!

       It's funny how people just repeatedly pull this out of their ass when it's demonstrably untrue: several countries are in the planning process of moon missions, NASA's own website stresses the importance of a return trip, and a former NASA astronaut has stated that a return trip to the moon would be the

       This "there isn't much to do there, its just rocks" talking point is repeated over and over again.
      </p>
      <p>
       The history of mankind has proven without a doubt that human beings are absolutely addicted to exploring and never stop finding reasons to do it, with amazing results each time.

       People have never stopped exploring and the entire basis of science is built on going further and deeper into every aspect of reality that human beings can find.

      <p>
       Its like, even one simple thing like "gardening" could be explored indefinitely on the moon.
      </p>
      <p>
       What about attempts at exploring the moon's interior. We have found all kinds of precious minerals on Earth by digging and we obviously hadn't the slightest concept that they were there before we started doing it.
      </p>
      <p>
       What about attempts of bringing various insects onto the moon to see what happens to them?
      </p>
      <p>
       I could go on and on and on and I am not even a fucking scientist with the knowledge to know the million other fascinating things we could do up there.

      <p>
       Anyone who spouts off the "there is really no point in going up there" has lost their mind and forgotten the face of human exploration.

       Even if multiple nations, talking heads, and NASA's own website didn't assert why there actually are good reasons to go to the moon again, the average person like you or I can think of plenty of common sense reasons.

       Many Apollo believers also think Stephen Hawking is a legitimate scientist and view him as an authority. Well he's the one who's always talking about colonizing space and how it's our only hope as a species. So what, we're supposed to believe it's totally pointless to go to the moon or anywhere else in space until you're able to literally go 300x farther than the moon to Mars and set up camp there? It's so dumb. If man had

       Oh boy, this is gonna be fun.
      </p>
      <p>
       The issue you're having seems to be based on two parts:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         The "slingshot effect" is implausible; you really mean to tell me that these guys worked some rocketry magic to get back in
         <em>
          4 days?
         </em>
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         How the hell can that ship get back to earth on a tiny amount of fuel? Why did it take so much fuel to get to the moon, but only a tiny amount to get back?
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       I'm going to deal with each of these separately, then. I will caution you,
       <em>
        I am not an expert
       </em>
       . That being said, it gives me the perspective of a layman to literal rocket science, so I might be able to explain it a little bit better, and I'll try to cite sources as applicable.
      </p>

       I know this is a long wall of text, but I cannot more highly recommend reading it or something like it. Best case scenario, you learn something new that changes your views. Worst case scenario, you lost 10 minutes. Give it a shot, see what happens.
      </h2>
      <hr/>
      <h1>
       Getting back to Earth with almost no fuel
      </h1>
      <p>
       Full stop. We need to get something out of the way first, and that's the concept of delta-v (Δv, pronounced
       <em>
        delta vee
       </em>
       ). Delta-v is just change in velocity (delta=change). For instance, if you have enough gas in your car to get it from 0-60 MPH, assuming no pesky friction or air resistance, we'd say that your car has a delta-v of 60 MPH. If you actually execute that maneuver, we'd say that it's a 60 MPH delta-v maneuver.
      </p>
      <p>
       In physics and engineering, we usually use m/s (meters per second), though, as it's much easier to work with numerically. I'm not a fan of switching units around too much though, so if you want to get an idea of how fast something is in m/s, a good rule of thumb is to multiply the speed by 2 and add a little bit on top, and you'll get a speed in MPH. For reference, 100 m/s is about 220 mph. Fair?
      </p>
      <p>
       The second important concept is acceleration and its relationship to thrust. Acceleration is measured in m/s
       <sup>
        2,
       </sup>
       or
       <em>
        meters per second squared
       </em>
       . Basically, it's a measure of how much your speed changes, so if you accelerate at 5 m/s
       <sup>
        2,
       </sup>
       your speed is increasing by 5 m/s every second. Thrust (force), on the other hand, is measured in Newtons (N). The same force won't have the same effect on different masses, though, so if you apply a 100 Newton (about 22 lbs) force on a 100 kg object, it will accelerate much slower than a 10 kg object would. I'm guessing you already knew this part, but it can't hurt to write it all here.
      </p>
      <p>
       So how does this relate to space travel and rockets? Well, as a spacecraft burns through fuel, it gets lighter. That means it accelerates faster under the same amount of thrust, so if it wants to keep acceleration constant, it needs to use less fuel. That sounds pretty sweet! You just need a good enough rocket, some fuel, and you're good to go, right?
      </p>
      <p>
       Not so fast. You're going to run out of fuel for too long, so maybe you should stock up on some more fuel. Unfortunately, that fuel adds mass, so you're going to need to bring some more fuel up with you just to haul all that extra mass around, and maybe a more powerful rocket too. See where this is going? The amount of fuel you need to bring with you get really large, really fast. Specifically,
       <em>
        exponentially fast
       </em>
       . The further you want to go -- that is, the more total delta-v you want your rocket to have -- the more fuel you need to bring.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's a really elegant equation that describes that relationship, called the Tsiolkovsky rocket equation (or just "the rocket equation", because Tsiolkovsky is a terrible name to remember or pronounce):
      </p>
      <pre><code>delta-v = ISP * ln (mass_with_fuel / payload_mass)
</code></pre>
      <p>
       ISP is just a measure of how efficient your rocket is, if you want to think of it that way, so don't worry about it -- it's a constant, just remember that bigger is better. Anyways, this equation shows a logarithmic relationship between the amount of stuff you put in the rocket and the amount of fuel you need to get there. The fuel vs. payload graph looks something like
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsiolkovsky_rocket_equation#/media/File:Tsiolkovsky_rocket_equation.svg">
        this
       </a>
       , when solved and plotted correctly.
      </p>
      <p>
       Does the fuel problem make more sense now? The Saturn V had to be so amazingly enormous and powerful because it did a
       <em>
        fuckton
       </em>
       of heavy lifting. Getting people to the moon takes fuel. Landing them on it takes fuel. Getting them off it and back to earth takes fuel. All that adds up,
       <em>
        exponentially
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       So why can just the craft fly back to earth without some giant rocket behind it? This where three important things come into play:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         The CM ditched a good amount of mass before returning to earth. The Apollo missions called for the LM (lunar module, the actual lander) to be jettisoned in lunar orbit, so they don't have to haul that dead weight around. This results in an exponential decrease in fuel requirements.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Getting from a low lunar orbit to a high lunar orbit is much easier than getting from a low earth orbit to a high earth orbit. This is because the moon is a LOT smaller and less massive than the earth, so it takes less delta-v to perform maneuvers, and thus less fuel.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The Apollo 11 mission used a free-return trajectory ("slingshot", although I'm not sure where you got that one from), that requires very little fuel. Later missions used a different, but still very similar approach that yielded similar results. There's more on that in the next section.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       The jist of it is that the returning spacecraft had a ton of delta-v, enough to easily get it back to Earth. Specifically, the bit with the rockets and fuel stuff had a delta-v of
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_Command/Service_Module#Specifications_2%5D,%20or%20enough%20to%20get%20it%20from%200%20to%20*mach%208.5!*%20(6,200%20mph">
        2,800 m/s
       </a>
       . Sound like enough speed for you? Remember, it doesn't take nearly as much delta-v to leave lunar orbit.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <h1>
       "Slingshot" from the moon with 4 days and 3 guys
      </h1>
      <p>
       Another full stop. You're mistaken on two accounts, although it's not your fault. A slingshot, or gravity assist, was not used to get the Apollo astronauts home, it was a
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_return_trajectory">
        free return trajectory
       </a>
       (and related maneuvers for later missions), gravity assists are typically used to gain velocity or slow down, not to return from orbit of one body to the surface of another. For instance, the
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity_assist#Voyager_1_.E2.80.93_farthest_human-made_object">
        Voyager 1 probe
       </a>
       got gravity assists from Jupiter and Saturn (the two heaviest bodies in the solar system that aren't the Sun) and consequently noped the fuck out of the solar system due to the massive effect the maneuvers had.
      </p>

       The second mistake is that it took 3 guys to do all this. No offense, but that's blatantly wrong -- the physicists and other scientists at NASA were the ones who worked out exactly when to fire the engines and where the ship should be pointed when it did. Dozens of them. For years. So many maneuvers and effects are named (from Kepler's basic laws to the Oberth effect, Hohmann transfer orbits, and so on) after people
       <em>
        because it took some really clever people to come up with these things
       </em>
       . Not only that, but they had some very primitive (and sometimes
       <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2016/12/the-women-computers-who-measured-the-stars/509231/">
        human
       </a>
       computers behind the scenes that helped them out. The Apollo missions had some functional albeit simple computers onboard --
       <a href="https://github.com/chrislgarry/Apollo-11">
        go read their code, if you really want to
       </a>
       -- that helped the astronauts perform some of their corrections and maneuvers. Every time some issue came up that couldn't be resolved by a quick-thinking astronaut, you better believe that mission control was on the line ready to help out.
      </p>

       Anyways,

        <strong>
         free return trajectories
        </strong>
       </a>
       ! These are actually pretty simple, conceptually speaking. The basic idea is that you perform a small burn to escape lunar orbit, and then... fall. That's it. With no more moon to orbit, you let Earth's gravity do the rest. If you time your lunar exit burn just right, and you point your ship in just the right direction, you'll be able to get a pretty good flight back to earth, or at least something that can be worked with. There are usually some trajectory corrections - very small burns - on the way back to correct inaccuracies, or to line up your reentry just right so you don't incinerate, but that's not too big of a deal. Just point your ship and hit the buttons.

       People always say that these kinds of maneuvers are like throwing a baseball in San Francisco and hitting a window in New York, or some shit like that, but really, the orbit thing is probably easier. I bet that with no atmosphere, a rocket-powered baseball, and a team of the smartest people on the Earth, we could pull it off.

       Well since none of us are on the moon, i don't think it would be impossible to hide what went on up there. It seems like they're acting as shifty and confusing as possible, e.g. the film Astronauts Gone Wild, them saying they heard strange sounds on the moon, losing (taping over?) the original tapes.
      </p>
      <p>
       To hide technology from the rest of the world? IDK, it's all just conjecture. I wasn't there on the surface on the moon with a clipboard independently verifying the landing. I don't know what happened.

       I listened to the series titled "Cosmic Disclosure" with Corey Goode and David Wilcock. Corey essentially states that there is extensive compartmentalization in the goverment, with each
       <em>
        person
       </em>
       being fed intricate disinformation that makes them firmly believe they are the top dog with regards to the space program. Anyone trying to tell these people that there might be something more risks being physically assaulted on the spot, as we've seen Buzz Aldrin do. Their ego simply can't handle it.
      </p>
      <p>
       In any case, the idea behind this gradual leak of information is that the NWO section of the government has been given an ultimatum to release all the advanced technology by the aliens who gave it to them and this is how they weasel they way out of it without sharing any of it with us plebs.

       Not really into those two when i'm sober tbh. If you watch them you'll notice the prompts and softball questions David gives to Corey. It's all just too conveniant. Maybe they're been given disinfo but it sounds like they're just covering their arses. Compartmentalisation is a real thing, however.

       Unfortunately this is incorrect. Even the largest telescope on the planet - Even Hubble, cannot magnify that much.

       The only way you can see the landing site is via a flyby - Which has been done.

       Did they ever state that this shot was the entire earth shot from a distance? Or just earth from a distance? Because it is technically earth from a distance viewed through a window with a clear shot that shows it was through a window. NASA didn't remove that short bit of the clip with the cabin lights or the astronaut because there is nothing to hide here. This isn't a shot of the earth from the moon. This isn't a shot from the far reaches of space. This is en route. You've taken footage of a biased doc and removed the audio. There is zero critical thinking in the op in my opinion. I personally believe NASA is mostly fraudulent, but this is exactly why they can get away with lying to the populace. Because people will "disprove" the footage where nothing is hidden. Which pigeonholes our efforts in this community into a group of individuals unwilling to use critical thinking in an attempt to match an idea that some other genuine critical thinker proposed. I appreciate the effort. I guess. But this in relation to 9/11 is no different than Fox footage of the planes hitting the towers. It happened. The rest of the story is where the conspiracy lies. It pains me to see so much poor thought and poor conclusions being drawn and posted here. At least there were no obvious grammatical errors in the OP.

       According the documentary, yes. But again, I cannot personally validate that so I take it with a grain of salt.

       For me, the very act of the astronauts doing these camera tricks is enough to raise my eyebrows. Even if the footage was never used publicly.

       Yeah man, me too. I was always interested in space. For the first 25 years of my life I would have laughed at a person who claimed we never stepped foot on the moon.

       The more I researched though...

       It actually sucked to have to come to terms with the idea that maybe we didn't actually do the things we said we did. I even spent about a decade trying to debunk the debunkers, which was just as eye-opening and only reinforced that NASA is a very, very sketchy organization and most of its supporters are very, very uninformed about most NASA missions.

       For some reason there was an identical thread that got deleted where I left this comment. this seems like a weirdly complicated and ametuerish way to fake this. and if you think about it for a minute, it would not actually work:  Hold up your thumb and finger in a circle to create a fake "moon" from the background like this documentary is trying to say was done here. ... notice the issue yet? If the window is ten feet away, and the earth is 80 miles away in orbit, any tiny movement of the camera would cause the window frame to move in relationship to the earth in the distance and would destroy the illusion. The camera definitely does move when the astronaut's arm goes in front of it, which also raises another issue: if the earth 100 miles away is in focus, wouldn't the edge of the window be blurry like the astronaut's arm?

       The Earth wasn't "away in orbit". You don't seem to understand the simplicity of the illusion.

       Take a beach towel with random patterns on it. Now cut a circular hole the size of a baseball in a piece of black paper.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the blackness of the paper takes up the whole frame and all you see is the hole, then it would look like a floating planet in the patterns of the beach towel.

      <p>
       Your comment mentions "the Earth many miles away" multiple times so I can only ask you to watch again because it may take more than a few viewings to understand the illusion you are seeing.

       I understand it perfectly. I don't think you do. The video claims they are in low earth orbit. The earth isn't pressed against the window. Why don't you take a peice of paper and try the experiment you are suggesting? If you move the camera, the patterns on the beach towel would shift relative to the window, because the beach towel is farther away than the window.

       You seem to be grossly underestimating how big the Earth is compared to the size of the port window. The Earth would be the size of a large family house and the window would be the size of a nickel.
      </p>
      <p>
       If I went far enough from the hole, mounted the camera, and then zoomed in very close, then you absolutely would not be able to see a noticeable shift of the Earth. The Earth is massive behind that little hole. The camera is moving
       <em>
        millimeters
       </em>
       to the side while zoomed in.

       Actually, wait a minute. Let me get this straight.

       The size of the earth doesn't make any difference. the relevant factors are how far away you are from the window and how far the background (earth)is behind it. You see windows every day; on some level you know how they work. it's fascinating to me that you (and a bunch of other people in this thread) can become so invested in this idea that you can ignore the reality of your own experience... because a video told you something different?

       Personally I find myself more convinced that the footage we have was faked in advance because NASA knew (reasonably so) that the van Allen radiation belts would likely distort any photographs or videos and they wanted a backup. Maybe I'm wrong but that seems like the most plausible explanation to me

       Very possible. Its definitely more important to me to have people acknowledge that there
       <em>
        was
       </em>
       fakery going on. Which of course, doesn't necessarily mean that we didn't go. But that maybe there is more to the story then we are being told.

       Maybe you should watch the footage. Then you would realize that there are no stars because they have blackened the interior of the shuttle and are pretending that blackness is space.

       At least try to answer the question at hand. Why are you under the impression that they're trying to pretend that the capsule interior is space? Did it occur to you that maybe they turned off the lights inside so that they could change the exposure value of the camera to get a good image of Earth without being blasted by light?

       There are plenty of people who don't necessarily find this footage damning to the idea of the Apollo missions having actually happened, but even those people accept what the astronauts are doing in the clip. Whether they are doing it for fun, or to get some "Plan B" footage, I don't know.

       They would go as far as they could (Low Earth Orbit) and make footage like this.
      </p>
      <p>
       Had they done it the other way you described, there would be a much higher risk of technology catching up and debunking the footage.

       I have an education in film/media production and I can tell you that any halfway-competent organization in the 1960's/1970's would use miniatures or composite images to do this.  It's
       <em>
        way
       </em>
       cheaper and
       <em>

       more convincing.

       Go watch 2001: A Space Odyssey.  An independent filmmaker filmmaker figured out how to create photorealistic images of planetary bodies a solid year before we landed on the moon.
      </p>
      <p>
       The video you posted lacks all context.  There is no audio or backstory available.  We have no idea why they shot this.  Maybe the astronaut was just playing around with the camera for fun.  They do that all the time.  He even keeps the camera rolling after the window is revealed.  In order for your theory to make any sense at all, we would need to believe that this is leaked top-secret footage that NASA has never attempted to recover or explain.
      </p>
      <p>
       I love moon landing theories, but this is a weak one.  All it does is demonstrate that perspective can be manipulated with camera tricks.  Big deal.  We've known that for over 100 years.

       Great. So at least you admit that you are watching astronauts create a fake composite of Earth "for fun".

       It is not for me to decide why they did it or if anything sinister was behind it. I am simply passing along interesting footage. If you want to believe it was all a goof, thats all good. I cannot present any evidence that you are wrong or right about that.

      <p>
       This sentence is a little confused, but I wanna clarify something: Whether or not the camera is pressed up against the window makes barely any difference to the number of degrees it takes up in your field of vision. And assuming a constant focal length on the camera this is the same for the video.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then you do 3 gifs teasing everyone about the possibility that there's a light visible in the shot, proving it was filmed in an indoor set, only to then "shatter our minds" with the shot where the astronaut moves into the frame.

       <p>
        So wait, what? Yeah, that “Earth at a distance” was a clever camera trick. They used the circular shuttle window and the small part of the enormous Earth showing through that small circular window. Camera tricks and the illusion of a little “Earth ball” at a distance.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       so to make my point regarding this abundantly clear: The space something takes in your field of vision is based solely on the object's size and your distance to it. Unless the window on the capsule is some sort of a lens it makes negligible difference if the camera is up against the window or across the room.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, the batshit insane suggestion that they would actually release this shot where the "trick" is revealed for all to see.

       I really want to take the time to answer everything you wrote but literally everything you wrote proves that you either didn't watch the gifs or you didn't understand them.
      </p>
      <p>
       You are harping on details as if I am inventing them from my mind. You can clearly watch the footage and see that I am describing something that has been filmed.
      </p>
      <p>
       It seems like you don't even understand that you are not looking at the Earth floating in space, you are not looking at a blackness of space absent of stars.
      </p>
      <p>
       You are looking at a darkened module interior that is mimicking space as an intentional optical illusion.
      </p>
      <p>
       You either don't seem to find anything interesting about the astronauts faking a shot of Earth at a distance or you are one of the many people fooled by the illusion and need to watch it a few times until it finally dawns on you what is happening.

       I see. I gotta say, man, that really did not come across at all in your initial post.
      </p>
      <p>
       So the trick is:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        be at low earth orbit,
       </li>
       <li>
        shoot the earth through the small circular window,
       </li>
       <li>
        regulate the exposure so that the inside of the cabin looks dark enough to be confused with the void of space,
       </li>
       <li>
        at the same time creating the illusion of a much smaller earth to give the impression that they are much farther away than they are.
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       this is definitely not the case.
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         This isn't some landmark footage or anything, it's test footage. It might prove something if it were the only footage we had of earth from apollo 11, as it stands you still have to deal with the many other images they've published. [such as]((

         there are two distinct sections in the footage you show, in neither is case the view of earth limited by the edges of the window

       Okay, great. Thanks for watching again. You definitely get the illusion and you wrote it out well.

       For the second part of your comment.
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         I am honestly not sure if that photo was made in the same way by using the window. It seems to me like it could be but I am not saying it was.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Thanks for taking the time to make this. According to the narrator in the original documentary, they were using some kind of homemade divider to give the window that "visible penumbra". In this gif you can "kind of" see what they are talking about. But I am not going to say its true or false one way or the other.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       However, I based on the following gif:

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       I do not see how you could conclude that those "Earth at a distance" shots are real and not a product of the illusion.
      </p>
      <p>
       Because you can clearly see that the "hanging control light" doesn't change location or size when the camera settings are readjusted and the main port window is revealed. Seconds before the reveal you can see that you are still seeing that small "Earth at a distance" illusion.
      </p>
      <p>
       Though I will agree that there seems to be a camera (documentary-wise) cut right before this happens. So the new clip kind of a fades in and you can see the hanging light and kind of make out the window behind, but the astronaut is blocking the full shot of "the illusion" as it transitions into a full lit view of the interior.
      </p>
      <p>
       So that is strange editing to me. It would have been much smarter and convincing to show that entire clip with no cuts or editing and allow the view to watch the entire transition.
      </p>
      <p>
       So while I wonder why the documentary makers didn't show that, I also have to wonder about that hanging light that is still clearly visible into the "blackness to lit interior" transition shot. Because again, it doesn't change size or location.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I just cannot unsee the previous clips where we see what appears to be Earth at a distance, but that hanging light is sitting there apparently floating in space.
      </p>
      <p>
       I cannot wrap my head around that. It doesn't appear to be a reflection. It appears to be a light inside of the interior, which would mean that this illusion of "the blackness of space" is not space at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know, I would really love to get a hold of that Apollo 11 DVD set and see if there is extended footage. If I ever do I will send you a message. Because I definitely do want to know the truth, even if shatters everything I have written in this post.
      </p>
      <p>
       And seriously, thanks for taking the time to keep responding to me and having this conversation.

      <p>
       Right! I think I wasn't completely clear, there is what you might call an 'optical illusion' going on. because the exposure is adjusted for the earth, the interior looks very dark, and without knowing this the viewer assumes they are seeing the earth surrounded by empty space.
      </p>
      <p>
       My point is that this isn't a
       <em>
        deliberate
       </em>
       illusion. It's not an attempt to trick the viewer! And how could it be, given that
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        they gain nothing by producing this imagery in this way because
        <strong>
         if he put the camera right up to the window it would look exactly the same
        </strong>
        without the risk of exposing any "trickery". Remember my point about field of view: being across the capsule or up against the window makes no difference to the apparent size of the earth in the field of view of the camera because the width of the capsule is negligible compared to the distance to the earth.
        <strong>
         They can't make the earth look smaller by shooting from across the capsule
        </strong>
        , that's not how optics works ( that is, if you concede that they are at least in low-earth-orbit, and that the window isn't some kind of lens, like I mentioned ).
       </li>
       <li>
        it shows the fucking room in the publicly available footage. I mean, honestly this is all you need to know. If your source for the evidence of the conspiracy is the conspirators themselves then you probably didn't unveil anything.

       it's not and it was never meant to be! I think the whole confusion here is coming from the fact that you ( or perhaps the documentary you're referencing ) are assuming that NASA was trying to pass this off as "authentic space footage" or whatever, but they aren't! it's just some camera tests, and that's all they claim it to be! The transition shot, as you call it, where the white balance is adjusted for the brightness of the interior should make this perfectly clear!

       One explanation I heard is that the astronauts really did land on the Moon, but the footage couldn't survive the trip back due to radiation so NASA simply concocted a bunch of footage in an Earth studio. Also, I heard that NSA authorizes all materials released for the public, meaning that it's all redacted and/or censored completely.

       Why do people always need to attempt to conflate healthy skepticism of NASA with "believing the Earth is flat"?

       Why are you trying to muddy this thread instead of commenting on the content of the gifs I posted?

       The fake moon landing theory is neither analogous to nor as outlandish as flat earth in my opinion.  Not only would a successful hoax have given a significant boost to national pride after the USSR beat the US into being first to space, but it would've egged the Soviet Union into dumping more of their budget into their space program, hastening their economic collapse.  Flat earth has no such remotely plausible human motive that I've heard, anyway.

       Unfortunately this is incorrect. Even the largest telescope on the planet - Even Hubble, cannot magnify that much.

      <p>
       The only way you can see the landing site is via a flyby - Which has been done.

       No you can't. But people sure do love to parrot this talking point.

       Also, I have a $8000 telescope and you absolutely cannot make out any artifacts on the moon.

       Also, that telescope costs much more when it first came out, I bought it used and it still cost 8 grand.

      <p>
       The "accuracy" of the photo through math, how, and what for? The only thing I could think of would be that somehow someone would figure out that the size of the landmass isn't accurate compared to the altitude of the camera. But they would already need statistics of the camera's altitude and position, etc. Now, I don't know much about what NASA releases along with the photos (if they give out that sort of information, or not) but it seems to me they would be able to do the math themselves and A) make the landmass in the photo the correct size for the altitude, etc. of the camera, or B) if not, at least lie about the statistics of the camera to match the size of the landmass in your photo.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not strong enough to say they forgot the land, and to say they simply did not include it so people could not calculate the correct landmass size vs. altitude (because I'm not sure what else they could calculate from it that would prove anything) is also not very strong.
      </p>
      <p>
       It goes back to what is a "real" picture of the Earth from space, and how do you spot fakes?

       Such a maneuver has never been done but like you said we are supposed to believe that these three nimrods did it on the first try. This is so complex and difficult of a maneuver most people can't even appreciate that. Think about how precise the timing would have to be...... with zero margin of error.
      </p>
      <p>
       The docking mechanism is depicted as sort of a rod that clicks into a slot on the other craft while in orbit, locking them together. You might remember that scene from Apollo 13. It's just another penis joke, probably.

       Exactly, FFS!. Yet people are going to come on here and throw some BS science/physics as the answer.

       This is all dependent on the fact that the ship that was orbiting around the moon had to be in such a position to be nearby.environment.. did the other ship drift of course, did the lunar lander not behave correctly floating up miles into space?
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not Star Trek, where they can just fly around and find the ship. That's a tiny ship with limited, if any, fuel left.
      </p>
      <p>
       Plus, when they departed down to the moon, they just undocked it and neatly went straight down?
