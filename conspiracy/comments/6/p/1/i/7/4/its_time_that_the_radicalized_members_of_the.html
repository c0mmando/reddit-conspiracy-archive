        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The Dems have used fraudulent hearings to convict President Trump, by rumor, innuendo, and media character assassination. This attempted coup is treasonous, and has included intentional obstruction of justice of the Chief Executive of the US in his mandated duty; sedition, and the attempted coup by the Obamas and the Clintons, financed by various globalists. </p>

<p><strong>Take the gloves off and stop being so polite.</strong></p>

<p>We the People want hearings now and throughout the Trump presidency, in order to investigate the Obamas, The Clintons (including Chelsea), Soros (and all Globalists) the radicalized members of the Democratic Party; the radicalized members of every branch of the government (including activist judges); those in the Republican Party who have cooperated with the coup, (sabotaged President Trump&#39;s legitimate leadership, and undermined his ability to carry out the EXPRESS WILL OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, and the mandate given him in the last election); those in the alphabet soup agencies who have been part of orchestrating and implementing these strategies.</p>

<p>We demand to know why BHO has been permitted to wage a cultural war on America. We demand to know if he is a leader in the Muslim Brotherhood. We demand to know how members of this terrorist group are entitled to told office in our government when their express commission is to overthrow our government, replace our Constitution with Sharia, and replace our government with a Caliphate. Why is any member of the Clinton crime family allowed to run for office, or hold any office?</p>

<p>Hold hearings - publicly ( so the American people finally get some answers). Arrest these criminals; demand the release of all Obamas records now stored in his &quot;presidential&quot; library as part of the hearings; investigate and bring colluding members of the media, the Hollywood sellouts and traitors who defamed the character of our good President, (and even threatened his very life.. etc...) to justice.</p>

<p>Its time to being all the Communist Dems, the Trojan Horse Muslims, the radicalized members of every institution in our country, and every frakking b***ard who has been part of trying to destroy Donald Trump, to justice.</p>

<p>Arrest the top players, and let the HEARINGS BEGIN. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>OP you have been blinded and brainwashed by partisan politics.  You seem to think that only or at least mostly only the Democrats are just plain evil.  Let me remind you that the GOP is just as evil and probably more obstructionist.  Look at the healthcare bill they just tried to pass!  It was blocked by other republicans!  Why didn&#39;t you mention them in your treason explaination?  </p>

<p>You also seem to be under the delusion that clinton and the dems are responsible for trumps repeated failures.  They&#39;re not.  Yes they have ben saying mean things about him in the media, but literally every president EVER has gone thru this.   ALL  OF THEM! and these attacks on trump are pat for course, regardless of how bad trump makes it out to be.  And the reason trump makes it seem so bad is because if he didn&#39;t it would require him to take responsibility for his own failures.  And we all know that TRUMP CANNOT AND WILL NOT TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR HIS OWN FAILURES.  He wouldn&#39;t even claim responsibility for a typo he made on twitter  (remember covfefe)!!!!  If he won&#39;t take responsibility for a typo on twitter, do you really think he will take responsibility for for policy failures?! Of course he won&#39;t!!!  He deflects and blames people that aren&#39;t even in politics for his failures as if they had the ability to write legislation!  He blamed the media and hilary for the failure of the Senate to pass a healthcare bill!  Did the media cast the deciding vote?!  NO!!!! they just said mean things about him that hurt trumps delicate snowflake fee fees!  </p>

<p>And as I said, Obama had it just as bad or worse than trump!  Yeah there are claims of collusion and other obvious bullshit, but has any big median outlets claimed trump is LITERALLY THE ANTICHRIST?!?!  even you stated that he was a secret Muslim brotherhood member, which has no basis in reality and is the equivalent of trumps russia allegations!  Both are equally bullshit.also, do people lob racist insults at trump all day everyday?  Do people threaten to rape his kids everyday?  Hell no!  So don&#39;t act like trump has it worst, worse than any other president ever, because this negativity is nothing new.  It&#39;s new to him, bit not new to his office.   </p>

<p>My main point is this, the dems and repubs are both equally evil, and trump is, at best, a pawn.  He is not worth your support.   </p>

<p>Yeah, thats why media and the elite sectors want to throw him out on baseless opinions. Trump is not controllable like Obama, Bush and Clinton would have been. </p>

<p>We are not blinded by your statements. Sorry. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Soros himself stated he could thwart anything Trump wanted to do. So who&#39;s in bed with Soros? That list of senators (both dems and repubs) making BDS illegal paints a good picture. Treasonous is a very fair word to use</p>
