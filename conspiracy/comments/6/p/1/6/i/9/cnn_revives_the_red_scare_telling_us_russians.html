       Yea I still can't get a clear answer from anyone for why present-day Russia is still our greatest enemy. How would improving relations with them and burying the hatchet  (much like what we're currently trying to do with Cuba) be a threat to the security of the US? All of the reasons you get are just fear-mongering and outdated information left over from the Cold War.
      </p>
      <p>
       Im guessing that's because all of the real reasons for why they are our biggest enemies probably wouldn't go over very well with the public. Reasons like:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         They support Iran (an Israeli issue that doesn't affect US security)
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The military-industrial-media-banking complex is too big to stop, and we must keep fighting wars and updating our weapons to stay ahead of our biggest enemies.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Fear helps us control and manage the population better, so it's better to always be relatively on the brink of a nuclear attack.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Putin is super against the IMF and central banks. IMO probably the biggest reason why Putin and Russia are demonized so much by the media.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       And a few others but you get the point.
      </p>
      <p>
       If anyone reading this has not seen The Putin Interviews with Oliver Stone on Showtime yet, I recommended watching all of them ASAP if you're interested in a different perspective of Putin. It's fascinating, really makes you ask a yourself a lot of questions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fair warning though, it's pretty much entirely subtitles. Might need to rewind a few times, but I'd say it's 100% worth it.

       That's not at all what happened and you should feel embarrassed about misrepresenting facts so badly.
      </p>
      <p>
       The people of Ukraine supported an EU-Ukraine trade deal. The government was on track to accept this agreement due to the popular support.
      </p>
      <p>
       Putin decides to bribe the PM of Ukraine into accepting only a Russia-Ukraine trade deal instead. Due to the popular support the EU deal had and the obvious corruption and bribery shown with taking the Russia deal, the people decided to rise up.
      </p>
      <p>
       During the protests and riots that ensued, the government was obviously in disarray and the United States had a leaked phone call with Nuland where Nuland stated that they couldn't wait for the EU to decide on who to support, so the US would throw it's support behind someone.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's the part you're misrepresenting by the way. Diplomatic support for a group of people isn't overthrowing the elected government. The people of Ukraine had done that themselves at that point.
      </p>
      <p>
       After that, Russia decided to annex Crimea, send soldiers and tanks into Ukraine. Igniting a full on civil war where Russian separatists would work the Russian military and receive arms from them, including the anti-air missiles that eventually would shoot down a civilian airliner.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's incredible how you can look at that situation, and say "The United States overthrow the elected government!" Because it's literally in no way at all what happened.
      </p>
      <p>
       Facts are facts, and your statement isn't one.

       You know who portrays the entire breadth of Ukrainian opposition to the actions of Putin and his separatists? Russian state media. Same shit garbage western media has done with "literally hitler" and "all Trump supporters are Nazis." Works every time if you want to demonize your opponent in the worst way. All that said, there is a hypernationalist militia fighting off the separatists up north (hey I thought r/conspiracy loves nationalists? What gives?), Ukrainian government lets them do whatever because they're kinda in a civil war otherwise. I'm sure they're not thrilled that they're fascists, but they're fighting off a much stronger/more clever country.

       I've already answered this question multiple times on this subreddit, so instead of typing up a long answer that I know will be ignored, I'll highlight some key things you're wrong about.
      </p>
      <p>
       You argue Putin is against central banks, yet there is a central bank of Russia. He himself appointed one of his own economic advisers to the central bank of Russia.

       I don't even know where you're getting this from, but I doubt it's anywhere in the United States. Who is talking about the impending nuclear war in the United States? What politician, media, or military official is openly stating these things and getting any traction?

       First, I'm not "Trump people". And second, if you "don't understand it", I recommend you go back to some different history books and learn more about him as a leader. You don't have to agree with all of his policies or methods to respect what he's been able to overcome and achieve. He's also incredibly intelligent and well spoken, as well as a black belt martial artist. And just like there's plenty of US Presidents that may have been responsible for some terrible things, we still give them admiration they deserved.
      </p>
      <p>
       I hate when people try to boil things down to simply Trump or anti-Trump. Doing so just restricts the amount of discussion that can be had on an issue.

       Like I said, I'm not saying I'm a fan of what he does. All I'm asking, is how would our governments getting along be a threat to national security. You just reply with ad-hocs and snark.

       The example you provided said you admired a KGB authoritarian who created a government where he has direct control over the military, intelligence services, media, political and economic system.

       The same person who said the biggest tragedy of the 20th century was the collapse of the Soviet Union?

       At no point in that long tirade did you give me a reason for Putin or Russia being a direct threat to US security. I'll even concede to all your points, as I never tried to argue that Russia wasn't doing many of the same things. What I asked was, how is improving the relationship between our two countries a direct threat to our homeland security?

       Regardless. The structure of the IMF or the central banks of the nations who take part in the IMF is irrelevant to your being wrong that Putin hates central banks. You should have said, "Putin hates the central banks of the west, because it gives them the ability to resist Russian pressure and influence," but you didn't because the only honest way to phrase your statement didn't fit your agenda.

       It's economics and geopolitical power. For example, the US wants to help their "allies" the Saudis get a pipeline constructed in Syria. Russia, meanwhile, wants a different pipeline built in Syria that would allow them to export to Europe more easily. The US wants to help Saudi Arabia maintain power in the region and generate profits, Russia wants to maintain their power in the region and generate more profits for their energy export.

       In all reality, even if your neighbors were spies, they likely would be spies of the sort you need to worry about.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd imagine more than likely there are plenty of industrial spies and industrial espionage going on everywhere in many countries. Probably from both competing companies as well as foreign national groups with specific industrial interests.

       Around 1 million duplicate entries from people of all political walks of life were removed from states they no longer live in. The other 21 million is the number of people who need ID to vote.

       Not a single one of these individuals were ineligible to vote nor was a single vote "eliminated".

        In the name of voter fraud, 1.1 million voters were removed from the registration lists through voter purging in the months before the 2016 election, and 21 million eligible voters were removed from the polls through voter ID restrictions.

       That's from your article. It literally says "Russians hacked the election" then a couple paragraphs down explains why the voters were removed.

       If they leaked the DNC emails, they should get a nobel peace prize for exposing how far our democracy has fallen. Instead of fixing it. The DNC is covering it up and deflecting blame. Not a single patriot in that party. But it doesn't matter anyway. Russia didn't leak it, Seth rich did.

       Trump is president because the "liberal" media propped him up as a "pied piper candidate". This was a deliberate tactic of the Clinton campaign. So not only did the Democrats rig their primary against a popular candidate who is now universally recognized as the most popular politician in the country, but they also helped Trump get the free media coverage he needed to become the Republican candidate.
      </p>
      <p>
       And then because Clinton was so terrible, millions of lefties like me who would have been excited to vote D ended up staying home or voting third party instead.

       Except that's bullshit. The United Soviet Socialist Republic was SOCIALIST and socialism is commonplace in the modern world. Authoritarian regimes calling themselves "socialist" have been failures, but it's not a bad thing for power to be distributed evenly among the working class. Or do you not think the working class deserves to have power? You like it when a class of "elites" rule everything?

       I've already answered this question multiple times on this subreddit, so instead of typing up a long answer that I know will be ignored, I'll highlight some key things you're wrong about.
      </p>
      <p>
       You argue Putin is against central banks, yet there is a central bank of Russia. He himself appointed one of his own economic advisers to the central bank of Russia.

        Fear helps us control and manage the population better, so it's better to always be relatively on the brink of a nuclear attack.

      <p>
       I don't even know where you're getting this from, but I doubt it's anywhere in the United States. Who is talking about the impending nuclear war in the United States? What politician, media, or military official is openly stating these things and getting any traction?

       That's really all you have to say. It's a wonder he has made it as far as he has. The last guy that opposed those things ended got the ol "we came, we saw, he died" treatment.

       If they leaked the DNC emails, they should get a nobel peace prize for exposing how far our democracy has fallen. Instead of fixing it. The DNC is covering it up and deflecting blame. Not a single patriot in that party. But it doesn't matter anyway. Russia didn't leak it, Seth rich did.

       It's economics and geopolitical power. For example, the US wants to help their "allies" the Saudis get a pipeline constructed in Syria. Russia, meanwhile, wants a different pipeline built in Syria that would allow them to export to Europe more easily. The US wants to help Saudi Arabia maintain power in the region and generate profits, Russia wants to maintain their power in the region and generate more profits for their energy export.
