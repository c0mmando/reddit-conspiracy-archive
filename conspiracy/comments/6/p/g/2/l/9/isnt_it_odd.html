        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>That right before, I mean the day before, trump made the remark about sessions being &quot;beleaguered&quot; that suddenly and out of nowhere sessions name was being smeared all over this sub?  Yes we have had several anti sessions posts on here before which is not surprising given his thoughts on stealing Americans property via asset forfeiture and his views on weed.  It was nothing new, but suddenly it was a hot topic the day before the comment trump made along with trump saying he wouldn&#39;t have hired him if he knew he was going to recuse himself.  And now that trump has made another negative comment about sessions, the anti sessions propaganda is still going strong.  </p>

<p>Some of these posts, I believe are organic.  I think some real honest people just parrot whatever the president says because he is their guy and they think he really is out for them, and in my opinion its not unreasonable to dislike an old man that is clearly stuck in a 1950&#39;s mindset.  I also think more than half of the anti sessions posts on here are nothing less than the work of paid government shills.  </p>

<p>We all know that shills exist on this sub.  We also know that there are several, and oftentimes competing groups of shills here. Honestly, I thibk this sub is a slam dunk for the pro trump shills because they know how closely tied this sub is to the_donald.  </p>

<p>My main takeaway from this post is don&#39;t let the shills dictate your point of view even if the appear to be on your side, because shills are NEVER on your side.   They only exist to change your mind and promote division within our ranks.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This sub is <em>not</em> closely tied to the Donald Trump sub. If you believe that is, then you are merely showing us that you haven&#39;t been on r/conspiracy very long. This sub <em>appears</em> to be closely tied to T_D right now <em>because</em> of shills. Before the election they weren&#39;t here in as great of numbers. </p>

<p>After the election there was a huge movement by bots and ShareBlue shills to associate r/conspiracy with pro-Trump ideology in an attempt to discredit the sub and to degrade the quality of debate and conversation occurring. </p>

<p>I have personally witnessed this change and the attack on free thinking. The number of political posts on here skyrocketed after the election. We were also bombarded by users from other subs who do not appreciate critical thinking or distrust of authority. These people come here to make fun of conspiracy theories and to once again, degrade the conversation.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve also notice an increase in comments on posts where users ask for &quot;sources&quot;. It&#39;s like people are so intellectually inept that they can&#39;t even consider the possibility of a conspiracy without some sort of authority confirming it. My argument here is that these organizations that provide &quot;sources&quot; or claim to be an authority on information are a part of the system. The owners of these &quot;sources&quot; have an agenda  and have a stake in controlling what we believe.</p>

<p>This is something that has really began to irritate me. This is a <em>conspiracy</em> sub. We <em>theorize</em> what conspiracies might be occurring. If you can&#39;t entertain a thought without a source behind it don&#39;t annoy us all by commenting asking for one. It&#39;s just obnoxious.</p>

A post like this one <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/C_S_T/comments/6niafw/the_five_levels_of_truth/">Five Levels of Truths</a> would have been welcomed here before the election and would have generated a great debate.

<p>that suddenly and out of nowhere sessions name was being smeared all over this sub?</p>

<p>People hated sessions when it was being nominated</p>

<p>They hated him when he became AG</p>

<p>They hated him before and after  Trump called him &quot;beleaguered&quot;</p>

<p>Shit man, people just don&#39;t like him, nothing suddenly about it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>but suddenly it was a hot topic the day before the comment</p>

<p>Because he was moving towards more asset forfeiture, people people REALLY fucking hate.</p>
