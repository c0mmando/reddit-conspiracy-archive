       Also, for bonus points, that comment is currently the top comment. But there is an extremely good chance that we are about to witness some hardcore forum-sliding.
      </p>
      <p>
       I always find it interesting how random reddit appears to be, in that I could click on this thread in an hour and the "best" comment could be one with far less upvotes. But since we are just supposed to "trust" reddit admins are not manually moving things around, I guess that is where the conversation ends.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also remember that MOST people go into a comment section, see the top couple best comments and then move on. So simply pushing a comment down a couple more slots is literally the difference between a few thousand or a few million seeing it.

       Why? Genuinely curious. I think based on the initial (shorter) comment, it seems like a very genuine criticism of the current state of things. If anything, I am surprised it is allowed to be so visible on this obviously rigged website.

       No, first sign was the typical: "I was going to write a longer comment, but didn't". They did write it (ie. scripted), and then got the community have them write it out in full. Typical scripted comment. Second, the give 50% SJW issues, and throw in NSA spying, etc etc to validate the other side, making it appear more "legit". This is a scripted comment, hook, line, and sinker.

       Looking at that user's submission history says otherwise. Unless it was created years ago as some kind of psyop.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also don't understand why a "shill" or "agent" would make a comment that is openly criticizing the current surveillance state.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whats the end game there? Also, paid agents and shills with agendas know how reddit works. They would know that many more people would read the first comment and a smaller percentage would read the next one.
      </p>
      <p>
       A shill or agent would have simply written "edit" and then added the longer response. Because I do agree with you that the longer response isn't the same as the shorter one and goes into some things that I do not necessarily completely support.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I think that can be answered by people having different opinions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Believe me, I went into that thread very skeptical and with the assumption that most of the "I am very old, here are my opinions" comments would actually be written by young, paid, agents.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I do not personally think this user is one of them. Which was surprising to me. Thats why I linked it here.

       For all I know, his/her grandson could've sold the account out to the many buyers on the internet. I've been on reddit for a very long time, and I know people, and tactics various groups use. That comment is 95% scripted, imo.

       Again, why would a "shill" account be putting government surveillance on blast?
      </p>
      <p>
       Its seems like basic logic is being abandoned by calling this person fake.
      </p>
      <p>
       If someone was praising the government and talking about "if you have nothing to hide, then don't worry", that would be a sign of a fake shill account.

       This is the exact opposite of that. I really don't understand why you guys don't see that.

       You do realize a shill account simply exists to push forward a narrative right?

       In this case, it could be a shill created to push the anti-gov or sjw narrative.

       I'm 67 agreed with all the things the old guy said, especially the idea that our water and air is a LOT cleaner.  I remember "smog" alerts when the air was so thick with smog you couldn't see the skyscrapers driving into town.   I remember not being able to eat the fish we caught in a local river.   That's all changed now.  I also remember when the police didn't think everyone was a criminal

       I see your point. But also understand my reasoning. That post appears to have been written 2 years ago. And as far as I know, you cannot edit submission headlines to appear different than the way you originally wrote them.

        Better today – I was in high school and college when the Civil Rights movement was happening. It was incredible to me that minorities were treated as somehow less human. I watched on TV as police brutalized black people. We also had Black Panthers in our city and they were frightening as well. It seems better now in that the blatant racism is not as prevalent as before, yet in other ways it seems like minorities should have progressed more by now.

       Only some very young or very immature would say this, maybe both. I'm only eighteen years old, but sometimes it makes me cry when I think about how old and how very
       <em>
        knowledgeable
       </em>
       and aware my parents are of how the world works. They'll whisper something here, and say another thing vague there, and in an instant the conversation will be gone. We moved from Jamaica, and the culture there- the society there- is very different from North American (Canada/USA) society.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, they seem to be getting along with their 9-5 jobs, coming home, cooking dinner and watching family feud, but I know it took a really hard toll on my dad and he became very, very angry. In Jamaica their lives were so much more different and more successful and exciting, they had so much more to do. But unfortunately, violence pushed our family out of the country, and to this day Jamaica decays.
      </p>
      <p>
       I still remember living there, but I moved to Canada when I was young (about 6 years old) so I adjusted very quickly, I didn't know any better. But every time I think back to life before coming to North America... if you ask me how living in Jamaica feels...
      </p>
      <p>
       Justice, truth be ours for-everrrr Jamaaica land we loooove.
      </p>
      <p>
       It feels like... freedom.

       It's not special in that the 68 year old is relatively young.  Not like we're taking about a centenary giving his account of the great war.  Many people where I work at 68.

       I'm 68 and grew up within walking distance of all my grandparents and two of my great-grandparents, all of whom were born in the late 1800's.  I was a good listener and they were good talkers.  I also spent many hours in homes for the aged talking to their contemporaries.  I lived across the street from a woman whose father was born in 1824.  My grandmother and her mother had a very good friend who was born in 1836.  My great grandfather and uncle patented the first coffee grinding machine and help design the first air-cooled automobile (The Franklin).  I have a very good sense of what the world was like and the people who lived in it in the 1800's.  My next door neighbor and his wife were married in 1904.  My neighbor on the other side was a physician in the military and published a book (which I have) on military surgery in 1916.  His father helped establish the science of Paleo Botany.  My uncle flew over 'The Hump' during WW2 and had to bail out with his crew.  His story was told in The Saturday Evening Post in March of 1945.  I'm very big on genealogy and history, too.  I can talk to you about life in those days in a way that few others can because I grew up in a small town and knew everybody on my street.  The older people freely talked with me all the time and even gave me many mementos of their lives.  I have a darned good memory of these conversations and the people who shared them with me.  I'm not just someone who is 68.  I'm a living connection to the world of 120-140 years ago.
