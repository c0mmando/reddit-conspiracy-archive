    <div class="md"><p>Regarding this post, subsidizing corporations is not socialism. If government payments were &quot;socialist,&quot; then any and all governance would be &quot;socialism.&quot; That obvious can&#39;t work.</p>

<p>Socialism is when the government controls the means of production and distribution -- total control, not regulations. The critical flaw in socialism is the risk of corruption -- a flaw that may exist in any system.</p>

<p>In addition to the risk of corruption, capitalism has a unique and fundamental critical flaw. In capitalism, the accumulation of profits eventually robs the masses of the fruits of their labors. To prevent of delay this from occurring, governments need to regulate the economy, tax the wealthy, and prevent excessive consolidation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here in Canada you get $1,600/month in child support if you have 4 children. You get an additional $800/month for housing, $470 extra for basic needs. This definitely isn&#39;t all of the benefits and assistance you get, just some of the bigger ones.</p>

<p>So overall you&#39;d have $34,000 a year.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think you understand how expensive it is to have a child, much less 4 children.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Based on the most recent data from the Consumer Expenditures Survey, in 2015, a family will spend approximately $12,980 annually per child in a middle-income ($59,200-$107,400), two-child, married-couple family. [<a href="https://www.usda.gov/media/blog/2017/01/13/cost-raising-child">source</a>]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Obviously this is for the US and not Canada, but it&#39;s pretty easy to see that $34,000 isn&#39;t enough for a parent of 4 to &quot;coast&quot; off of their government benefit alone, especially when you consider the fact that your numbers are likely higher than the assistance provided in the US.</p>

<p>Edit: I did some math.</p>

<p>$800*12 = $9600 | $470*12 = $5640 | $34000+$15240 = $49240 &lt;-- <strong>total government benefit</strong></p>

<p>12980*4 = $51920 &lt;-- <strong>total cost of children</strong></p>

<p>Assuming everything was exactly the same, still doesn&#39;t account for utilities or rent higher than $800/mo, any sort of vehicle/transportation costs. Also, in Canada you don&#39;t have to worry about health care costs, so there&#39;s that. You&#39;re crazy if you think someone can actually live off of that alone without any additional work/help.</p>

<p>while the welfare class is free from financial constraints and gets <strong>rewarded with a higher standard of living</strong> for having more children</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You claimed this, but I don&#39;t think you understand what it means. People might be <em>surviving</em> on welfare because it&#39;s all they can do to get by, but that definitely doesn&#39;t equate to a higher standard of living. And often those on welfare are in a catch-22 where <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2015/08/why-single-moms-struggle-with-college/401582/">they can&#39;t afford to be off of welfare, but they also can&#39;t better their situation because they will then lose the welfare they need to make the transition</a>. In case you weren&#39;t aware, most welfare programs require the recipient to have work or be looking (and prove it).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>For single parents who rely on public assistance, college classes do not count as “work” in most states, so many of those who return to school lose access to benefits like childcare vouchers and cash assistance. The Welfare Reform Act of 1996, which limited recipients’ access to cash assistance, also restricted the definition of “work” to nine core categories. Work credit is largely limited to vocation-focused educational training, and only for a maximum of one year. Each state has its own specific regulations.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>lol, see, you buy into it too.</p>

<p>My background is in infant cognitive development. People really have no idea how many factors go into effecting early brain growth that are directly linked to socioeconomic factors. I was taught in college that the &#39;nature-nurture&#39; ratio was about 50-50, and even that was considered a liberal splice at the time. After years of more research, I think it&#39;s more like 70% environment, 30% &#39;nature&#39;. Genes need a certain environment to be expressed. If you handicap children from the second they&#39;re conceived (bad diet, stress on the mother, no father, no social safety nets), you&#39;re almost setting up kids to fail before they&#39;re even born. The importance of having two emotionally mature parents that love each other in determining the success-factor of a child is completely unmitigable....society doesn&#39;t give the vast majority of the populace the tools it needs to create that. So then, the eugenicists would completely ignore those factors (because most people don&#39;t even understand them to begin with) and say there&#39;s just something about the GENES that make them that way.</p>

<p>&#39;Pull yourself up by the bootstraps&#39; is a eugenicist talking point....as if that&#39;s all there was to it. </p>

<p>EDIT: Also, I&#39;d argue 34k a year is fucking nothing to a regular human being, much less one trying to raise kids. Granted, I live in a big city where that&#39;ll barely cover rent alone in some places....</p>

<p>socialist and communist used to be geographical synonyms. socialist was used in enland and US. communist in germany and eastern europe. </p>

<p>here, national socialists, would be just nationalists (national people&#39;s party). this is why hitler went after the communists first. had he been here, he would have gone after the socialists first. same difference.</p>

<p>fwiw, the split btwn communism and socialism began at COMMINTERN, by those who were horrified by lenin&#39;s speech there. they ceded communism to him. in the 50s, HUAC and the red scare focused on &quot;communist&quot; because of the soviets called themselves communists. the people they targetted, except those from eastern europe, did not call themselves communists. they called themselves socialists, though most weren&#39;t even socialists, just those denounced by nasty, nasty people for petty reasons.</p>

<p>there is no way to be a socialist facist. facism is a partnership of state and business for financial gain through profit. socialism is a partnership of state and worker for financial indepence through worker owned industry.</p>

<p>there is nothing socialist about our country. public works and citizen benefits are not socialist. they are effective governance. rome guaranteed a free grain allowance to all of the poor and never stopped creating public works, many still stand and work. why did they do this? it makes keeping the peace easier. </p>

<p>socialism: where in the means of production (capital) are owned by those who do the labor and where 100% of the profits belong to those whose labor created them. socialism is the direct opposite of capitalism--where in the means of production (capital) are owned by someone other than those who do the labor and where 100% of the profits generated by the labor of others belongs to them.</p>

<p>socialism is a non-market based economy. capitalism is a market based economy. the level of authoritarianism in either system is not fixed, it depends on the people running/organizing the state. contrary to popular belief, capitalism can be extremely authoritarian. in fact it works best in such conditions, which is why we keep installing tyrants.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for the recommendation. Based on my world view, I can&#39;t accept any theory for the causes of WW1 without addressing the role of the global financial cartel. Based on your responses, I don&#39;t expect you to accept this take on WW1 (no offense, really), but you might find it interesting nonetheless (and relevant since we are on a conspiracy forum).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wouldn&#39;t say that I put the global banking cartel first every time, because it entirely depends on the situation. But when it comes to something as major as a world war, I do believe they almost certainly played a role in its development and conclusion. When you have the ability and incentive to do so, it would be stupid not to.</p>

<p>Now, as for your claim that they may have made more money had the war not happened, that is potentially a good argument although it is virtually impossible to prove one way or the other, in my view. I tend to believe that those with money can make more of it during wartime than during peace, especially if you are lending to both sides. I could get into the reasons why if you would like, but ultimately I think its impossible to &quot;prove&quot; either claim.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not even <em>remotely</em> close. </p>

<p>Socialism is a wide variety of political and economic ideologies all loosely tied together through common support for the social ownership of the means of production. This can manifest in the familiar Marxist-Leninist style of state collectivization as seen in the USSR and China, but that is only one form of socialist ideology. There are numerous others, including various forms of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libertarian_socialism">libertarian socialism</a> i.e. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarcho-syndicalism">anarcho-syndicalism</a> which advocate instead either a more decentralized state or the absence of a state entirely.</p>

<p>I&#39;m assuming your reasoning is &quot;there&#39;s food stamps! There&#39;s medicaid! socialism!&quot; but the existence of <em>social safety nets</em> (which <em>are</em> socialist-derived ideas in the tradition of the Social Democrats and other capitalist reformist ideologies) does not mean that the political and economic organization of the country is in itself socialist. The U.S. economy is built on the private ownership of the means of production. It is, therefore, capitalist. There are some state-owned industries, but again- simply having a mixed economy with government involvement in some industries does not mean that the form of economics being practiced is socialist. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Rather then trying to fix the problems that create excessive unnatural wealth inequality they seek to &quot;maintain&quot; the poor.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is absolutely ludicrous that you&#39;re blaming this state of affairs on what you think socialism is rather than capitalism. Capitalism incentivizes and drives capital accumulation and the consolidation of wealth in fewer and fewer hands. That same drive towards profit incentivizes capture of the state, when private capital becomes powerful enough to influence the political process (surprise- it always does, eventually, no matter what reform is attempted). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes you did. Corporate bailouts are basically the epitome of capitalism. Private ownership of the means of production leads to concentration of wealth and power in the hands of few (private) parties. These parties then capture the government, which is &#39;socialist&#39; in the sense that it is owned by everyone, and then use it to their advantage.</p>

<p>Corporate bailouts are <em>the exact opposite of socialism</em>. They&#39;re capitalism taken to the extreme, to the point where common property (tax money) is <em>given</em> to powerful private interests when they fuck up.</p>

<p>But when you say that, what do you mean? Why? I&#39;m pretty sure you&#39;re talking about socialism as implemented by a centralized state, i.e. with Marxism-Leninism, but like I said before- there are varieties of libertarian socialism which by design seek to limit or end the state. Anarcho-syndicalism for example has no central state authority to abuse, centering instead on direct worker ownership of the means of production and participatory democracy. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>True capitalism would let them fail no matter what the consequences for society</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The thing is, capital is the source of all power. In a capitalist society, it is those with capital who possess nearly all political and economic influence. They use this influence to write our laws, even our Constitution, for their continued benefit. In this context, there will never be consequences for the majority of their actions, only those <em>so</em> egregious that public outrage is unstoppable.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Change will not occur until people get hungry, and I mean that literally</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I agree, unfortunately this seems to be the case. That&#39;s why I&#39;m trying to tell people that libertarian socialism exists. When things change, I don&#39;t want a simple transition to new masters. I want actual freedom and democracy, which is impossible (without acquiring capital of your own) under the capitalist mode of production. No worker is truly free when he must labor for another&#39;s profit in order to survive, with no alternative as all commons have been made private property. So too is there no democracy when capitalists inevitably use their ownership of capital to influence elections as well as society (i.e. through media ownership). </p>

<p>No shit, but the party leadership merely used socialist rhetoric primarily coming from the Strasserists in order to gain influence, then surprise!

<p>Did I ever say it would? I&#39;m arguing that it would democratize society through the democratization of the means of production, in much the same way as land reform and the dismantling of Crown authority paved the way for capitalism and democratic government in the first place. Capitalism is virtually indistinguishable from feudalism in the relations it forces between workers and employers. The serf gave up a quarter of his crop to his feudal lord, the wage laborer yields the <em>entirety</em> of his product only to receive a portion in wage. What&#39;s the difference, beyond imagined freedom on the part of the worker to &quot;choose&quot; to work? But remember, capitalism has privatized all that would otherwise be available to the worker to ensure his survival. There are no commons. There is no choice <em>but</em> to work. It&#39;s feudalism with imaginary freedom. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know why you&#39;re so resistant to this realization. Oh, wait, reading your other post it seems to stem from naivete. &quot;Just start your own business!&quot; wow, it&#39;s so stubble. Oh, wait, that&#39;s not feasible for the vast majority of workers (and indeed impossible for society to be comprised solely of self employed), and on top of that <em>it requires fucking capital to do so</em>. This must be obtained either through labor and saving, which is no different from a period indentured servitude (just bear with it and you&#39;ll have freedom at the end), ditto taking out loans from a bank (<em>if</em> they&#39;ll even lend in the first place).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Everyone wants everything for nothing.   </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I want an end to the fucking aristocracy capitalism creates. Why is it that only I am guilty of this? What about the millionaire of inherited wealth, who never lifts a finger in labor, instead extracting rent through the labor of others? Why is it that their ownership justifies their receiving something for nothing, yet the contributions my father, grandfather, or great grandfather might have made in contributing to his wealth have earned me no part of that capital? A thousand workers clear a field, build a mine, dig the earth, and yet only a handful- those who don&#39;t even work the mine- receive the entirety of the gain? And this is just, to you? </p>

<p>&quot;Oh but they earned it starting up that business!&quot; is such an infantile argument, how you don&#39;t realize that the same could be used to defend literal monarchy is beyond me. Did not the first kings &quot;earn&quot; their right to rule, by the same logic? </p>

<blockquote>

<p>His point is that this isn&#39;t a real thing, has never been a real thing, and never will be a real thing, because the power resultant from increasing capital accumulation (as is inevitable as &quot;winners&quot; out compete or simply buy out competition) in turn inevitably distorts politics and society in general. Even the total abolition of the state is no solution, because the capitalists would still hold all power and essentially remain as the state. Only it won&#39;t be the kind of government in which you&#39;re given the courtesy of a (meaningless) vote. </p>

<p>In this case, capitalist domination has proceeded to the near complete capture of the state, and this influence in turn is leveraged to steal tax money for these bailouts. It&#39;s not socialism, it&#39;s welfare for the rich through their manipulation of our political system. There is no such thing as &quot;corporate socialism&quot; unless you mean a system by which the means of production are owned &quot;for the people&quot; via corporations.

<p>You are once again mixing the failures of society with capitalism. The only reason real capitalism or socialism has not happened is that mankind has not yet managed to form a society that functions fairly. One could say that all societies ever have been slave plantations that let the slaves organize as cooperating or competing individuals. So a discussion like this is fairly impossible since we have only theory, no actual experience what works.</p>

<p>So you think socialism is just another word for co-ops? No, it is the realization of the motto &quot;from each according to their ability, to each according to their need&quot;. This includes &quot;workers own the means of production commonly, even when their responsibilities at the factory are different&quot;.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, I&#39;m <em>telling you</em> the <em>factual definition</em> of socialism is that it is a wide range of economic and political ideologies, many in direct contrast to one other with the exception of common support for worker ownership of the means of production. <strong><em>Privately owned</em></strong> (meaning: capitalist, as the <em>capital</em> is privately owned by a small group and workers labor on their behalf to their profit) corporations looting public funds as a result of their ongoing and continued domination via financial influence of our political system is not socialist. If you refuse to accept this, whatever, you can choose to believe patently wrong things if you want. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>You are once again mixing the failures of society with capitalism.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s almost like private ownership of the means of production allows for gross inequality and political influence for those who hold this capital, inevitably affecting the rest of society on every single level as their influence pervades our economic and political system. Oh wait, that&#39;s what&#39;s happening. Lobbyist money means more than your vote in determining policy, and this is an inevitable effect of private capital. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The only reason real capitalism or socialism has not happened is that mankind has not yet managed to form a society that functions fairly.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Holy fucking shit, are you for real? This is real capitalism, genius. Can you own a business? Can you own land? Can you charge rent? Can you hire a wage laborer, take his product and pay a portion of its value in wage? Yes to all of the above? Wow, welcome to capitalism dude. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>And the only reason &quot;capitalism&quot; has worked &quot;better&quot;  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The only reason capitalism has &quot;worked better&quot; is due to decades of influence on the part of the wealthiest country in the world to ensure the failure of all alternative systems. Dozens of coup d&#39;etats, economic sanctions all around (typically in response to human rights violations that occur after external support for violent counter revolution boils over) etc. Then there&#39;s imperialist action from both capitalists <em>and</em> Marxists ensuring the demise of any anarcho-communist states i.e. Revolutionary Catalonia or Anarchist Aragon. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>mankind has not yet managed to form a society that functions fairly. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>You can&#39;t have a fair society with democratic principles while at the same time maintaining a neo-aristocracy of capital owners with the majority of workers <em>by necessity</em> working for their profit in order to survive. It&#39;s inherently exploitative when the alternative to working as someone else&#39;s servant is homelessness and starvation in the streets. Hopefully someday you see that.</p>

<p>Nope, you rent land. Don&#39;t pay your rent (tax) = kicked out. Can i hire a laborer? Only if i pay government mandated wage and taxes and costs that go with it. Can i demand governemnt assistance? Of course, especially if i am too big to fail.</p>

<p>No, because no such corporation with private wealth would exist in a socialist system.</p>

<p>You still don&#39;t get it. The government &quot;giving&quot; money to a corporation is <em>literally impossible in a socialist state</em>. Why? Because <em>there are no private corporations</em>.</p>

<p>Again, the government (a communal system) giving money away to private interests (corporations) is <em>the epitome of capitalism</em>. It is literally changing socially owned money into privately owned money, i.e. moving away from socialism towards capitalism.</p>

<p>Socialism is a wide range of political and economic ideologies all loosely tied together through common support for the social ownership of the means of production. This can manifest in the familiar Marxist-Leninist style of state collectivization as seen in the USSR and China, but that is only one form of socialist ideology. There are numerous others, including various forms of libertarian socialism i.e. anarcho-syndicalism <strong><em>which advocate instead either a more decentralized state</em></strong> or <strong><em>the absence of a state entirely.</em></strong></p>

<p>Again, you&#39;re using a subset of socialist ideology to define all socialism. </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Capital accumulation is inevitable, with or without state involvement. The idea that all large economic organizations or monopolies require state influence to function or maintain dominance is just ludicrous and flies in the face of economic history. </p>

<p>Albert Einstein talks about this in his article <a href="https://monthlyreview.org/2009/05/01/why-socialism/"><em>Why Socialism?</em></a>, although he then goes on to advocate a planned economy (while noting that a planned economy is not in and of itself socialism, and may &quot;accompany the complete enslavement of the individual&quot; if improperly implemented):</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Private capital tends to become concentrated in few hands, partly because of competition among the capitalists, and partly because technological development and the increasing division of labor encourage the formation of larger units of production at the expense of smaller ones. The result of these developments is an oligarchy of private capital the enormous power of which cannot be effectively checked even by a democratically organized political society. This is true since the members of legislative bodies are selected by political parties, largely financed or otherwise influenced by private capitalists who, for all practical purposes, separate the electorate from the legislature. The consequence is that the representatives of the people do not in fact sufficiently protect the interests of the underprivileged sections of the population. Moreover, under existing conditions, private capitalists inevitably control, directly or indirectly, the main sources of information (press, radio, education). It is thus extremely difficult, and indeed in most cases quite impossible, for the individual citizen to come to objective conclusions and to make intelligent use of his political rights.&quot;  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Honestly, I used to simply dismiss anarcho-capitalists such as yourself entirely out of hand. However, now I feel that you are almost congruent with my ideological views, but you are focused entirely on the state when it is only one half of a rather complex equation. In your opposition to state tyranny, your proposed solution merely entrenches in its place private tyranny, and a different form of hierarchy. An-cap ideology simply ignores the exploitative nature of the wage-labor relationship, the feudal relationship society enforces upon the worker, and the unfathomable potential for abuse of power by the capitalist owner. In some ways, it&#39;s an inverse of the Marxist who focuses entirely on the abuses of capitalist owners and, seeking to end these injustices, hands the means of productions over to a state bureaucracy, only serving to transition authority and tyranny from one hand to the next. </p>

<p>I really wish you would ponder the question of freedom, and whether one can be truly free if one must labor for another- with no alternative, as capitalism has seen to it that everything has become private property- in order to survive. How can one be free to enter a voluntary contract when the alternative is starvation, homelessness and death? How can a wage be fair when it is negotiated with this relation in mind? How is death on the streets any less a gun pointed to one&#39;s head? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>In this sense, socialism is used ironicly, because corporations have this notion that they legally posses personhood.  So in corporate socialism the people are forsaken and the corporations, with their legal fictions, are the social benefactors of the state, rather than the actual people.  They posses all the benefits of personhood with little of the downsides like facing incarceration.  So, oddly, the shoe fits.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Might want to actually study what capitalism is and how it actually differs from socialism. </p>

<p>Capitalism in its most basic form means a small group of people privately own the means of production. This is despite the fact that production itself is socialized as large numbers of people in various industries work together to produce everything (for example, your PC required the work of people in plastics, microtechnology, glass, and transportation for it to exist and be available to you). This means that while many benefits of capitalism are socialized, profits are not so they go directly to the small group of owners. The fact that corporations can and do socialize detriments of capitalism as well while not continuing to make profit is just another side of that coin.</p>

<p>You can call the increasingly corrupted system corporatism if you want (Lenin called it Imperialism) but it&#39;s still capitalism since it&#39;s nature is defined by the basic relations described above.</p>

<p>I would like to remind everyone that conspiracies tend to be perpetrated by one group of capitalists subverting another, either against domestic or foreign competition. Just look at the supposed Russia scandal. Very simply, it seems as if this entire media war is centered around powerful people who either want to give a boost to the arms industry or promote stability and focus on infrastructure/curbing unrest at home.</p>

<p>I know most people in this thread will wildly disagree with my point of view but we should at least be consistent with our terms and understand a theoretical model of economics and politics. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not sure you understand what socialism is. A lot of people seem to be under the (false) impression that socialism means government handouts. But that is so incredibly wrong.</p>

<p>Most socialist systems in the past have actually just been authoritarian oligarchy&#39;s that use socialism as propaganda to gain political support.</p>

<p>The real, actual definition of socialism is; &quot;the workers control the means of production and the profits of their labor.&quot;</p>

<p>Nothing about that means that a government has to be the middle man. The idea that everything is owned by the State, and the State will &quot;divide up&quot; the products of labor fairly, is a recipe for disaster.</p>

<p>Modern socialists know this, and do not advocate (generally speaking) for a powerful central State that controls the economy. It&#39;s more local than that. Like, a huge corporation being owned by it&#39;s employees, not a small number of rich share holders.</p>

<p>socialism has never been achieved. </p>

<p>the soviets and chinese were not socialists. they had no way to be because on the eves of their revolutiontions their countries were still feudal and agrarian. socialism was a response to industrialized capitalism. marx himself pointed out to lenin that russia was unsuited for socialism.</p>

<p>the USSR was in many ways no different from tsarist russia, which was a brutal, tyranical govt as well. however,  no one went hungary in the USSR, many starved under the tsars, no one was homeless in the USSR, many were under the tsars. the areas that the tsars were superior was in fashion and architecture.</p>

<p>for china it was much the same.</p>

<p>additionally, neither country had any experience with democracy prior to revolution.</p>

<p>the standard convention is let them keep communist as a distinct firm of govt, since it was how they referred to themselves. funnily enough, both are suitable candidates for socialism now. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>no. what was needed was for the union movement of the 19th century to have succeeded. if the coal miners et al had succeeded in wresting control of the places where they slaved away for scraps from the capiralists that owned them, that would have been that, and west virginians would have had the highest standards of living in the world. still would be very high. the oil states would be higher though.</p>

<p>the movement was making steady progress all through the 1800s until in 1880-1890, big coal, big steal, and big glass destroyed them by going to eastern europe and recruiting hundreds of thousands of cheap labor. they paid them a signing fee.  gave them a meal. and put them on a boat to america for a job ready and waiting that literally was already filled. not only did it kill the union movement, it crashed the economy and caused the longest and 2nd steepest depression in our history. </p>

<p>american socialists were never focused on the govt for anything but enacting and enforcing labor laws, anti-coruption laws, anti-ursury laws, and closing the borders. there was no concept of &quot;big govt&quot; in 19th century US. the unions weren&#39;t fighting for bigger scraps like they now, they were literally fighting to take possession of their work places and get rid of all the capitalists, like j. h. blair in harlon county, ky.</p>

<p>i wish all of the knee jerk misinformed would study the coal war and then apologize to the dead socialists that gave them the right to not piss themselves at work. but it&#39;s not all their fault. the liberals/progressives, whatever they call themselves now, are equally misinformed and conflate socialism with large public works programs and state run alms for the poor. rome thrived with that system. they were not socialist. they were effective manipulators of civic contentment. give the poorest free grain and running water,  and avoid the guillotine. if only france had paid attention...it also controls disease. it&#39;s just good governance.</p>

<p>curiously, those trying starve the govt and stop all public works are pushing us towards a pre-revolutionary france like situation. rome made sure people always had enough to be afraid of losing it. france could give a shit. and as they learned, people with nothing to lose topple govts. even our income stratification is pre-revolutionary france like, except worse. there is greater disparaity between average americans and the 1%, then there was between louis and his peasants.</p>

<p>the fruits of socialism are kept by the fact that those doing the labor get the full value of their labor. you dont need hand outs when you have enough money to live autonmously with dignity. this is only possible if none but them is profitting from their sweat. socialism doesn&#39;t redistribute. it evicts. it truely was (is)revolutionary and truly did threaten the oligarchs.</p>

<p>believe me, you do not keep the fruits of capitalism. very quaint notion. you keep the dirty, rotten, greasy, black banana peel, and you have to share it.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>socialists mostly mean well <strong><em>but ultimately support state coercion,</em></strong> a classic case of the road to hell is paved with good intentions.</p>

<p>Socialism is a wide range of political and economic ideologies all loosely tied together through common support for the social ownership of the means of production. This can manifest in the familiar Marxist-Leninist style of state collectivization as seen in the USSR and China, but that is only one form of socialist ideology. There are numerous others, including various forms of libertarian socialism i.e. anarcho-syndicalism <strong><em>which advocate instead either a more decentralized state</em></strong> or <strong><em>the absence of a state entirely.</em></strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, you&#39;re using a subset of socialist ideology to define all socialism. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>If there is no state &quot;vehicle&quot; to control and no business &quot;vehicle&quot; to hide behind the accumulation of wealth is limited by the burden of responsibility for your enterprise.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Capital accumulation is inevitable, with or without state involvement. The idea that all large economic organizations or monopolies require state influence to function or maintain dominance is just ludicrous and flies in the face of economic history. </p>

<p>Albert Einstein talks about this in his article <a href="https://monthlyreview.org/2009/05/01/why-socialism/"><em>Why Socialism?</em></a>, although he then goes on to advocate a planned economy (while noting that a planned economy is not in and of itself socialism, and may &quot;accompany the complete enslavement of the individual&quot; if improperly implemented):</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Private capital tends to become concentrated in few hands, partly because of competition among the capitalists, and partly because technological development and the increasing division of labor encourage the formation of larger units of production at the expense of smaller ones. The result of these developments is an oligarchy of private capital the enormous power of which cannot be effectively checked even by a democratically organized political society. This is true since the members of legislative bodies are selected by political parties, largely financed or otherwise influenced by private capitalists who, for all practical purposes, separate the electorate from the legislature. The consequence is that the representatives of the people do not in fact sufficiently protect the interests of the underprivileged sections of the population. Moreover, under existing conditions, private capitalists inevitably control, directly or indirectly, the main sources of information (press, radio, education). It is thus extremely difficult, and indeed in most cases quite impossible, for the individual citizen to come to objective conclusions and to make intelligent use of his political rights.&quot;  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Honestly, I used to simply dismiss anarcho-capitalists such as yourself entirely out of hand. However, now I feel that you are almost congruent with my ideological views, but you are focused entirely on the state when it is only one half of a rather complex equation. In your opposition to state tyranny, your proposed solution merely entrenches in its place private tyranny, and a different form of hierarchy. An-cap ideology simply ignores the exploitative nature of the wage-labor relationship, the feudal relationship society enforces upon the worker, and the unfathomable potential for abuse of power by the capitalist owner. In some ways, it&#39;s an inverse of the Marxist who focuses entirely on the abuses of capitalist owners and, seeking to end these injustices, hands the means of productions over to a state bureaucracy, only serving to transition authority and tyranny from one hand to the next. </p>

<p>I really wish you would ponder the question of freedom, and whether one can be truly free if one must labor for another- with no alternative, as capitalism has seen to it that everything has become private property- in order to survive. How can one be free to enter a voluntary contract when the alternative is starvation, homelessness and death? How can a wage be fair when it is negotiated with this relation in mind? How is death on the streets any less a gun pointed to one&#39;s head? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>the problem with socialists is allowing themselves to be sucked into a troll&#39;s maw.</p>

<p>socialism has never been achieved. </p>

<p>the soviets and chinese were not socialists. they had no way to be because on the eves of their revolutiontions their countries were still feudal and agrarian. socialism was a response to industrialized capitalism. marx himself pointed out to lenin that russia was unsuited for socialism.</p>

<p>the USSR was in many ways no different from tsarist russia, which was a brutal, tyranical govt as well. however,  no one went hungary in the USSR, many starved under the tsars, no one was homeless in the USSR, many were under the tsars. the areas that the tsars were superior was in fashion and architecture.</p>

<p>for china it was much the same.</p>

<p>additionally, neither country had any experience with democracy prior to revolution.</p>

<p>the standard convention is let them keep communist as a distinct firm of govt, since it was how they referred to themselves. funnily enough, both are suitable candidates for socialism now. </p>

<p>if the american socialists of the 19th century union movement had won, the world would be unrecognizable today. we were one of the birth places of socialism btw.</p>
