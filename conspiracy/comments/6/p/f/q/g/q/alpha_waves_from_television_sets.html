    <div class="md"><p>So many things go into that as well, like the individual sound tracks, the relatability of the characters, and the content of the show. That&#39;s why more and more shows are being created, to allow everyone to be in this suspension of disbelief. </p>

<p>Perhaps the suspension of belief can be addictive? As in people crave that state of comfortability that they only find in entertainment?</p>

<p>Also, another comment, maybe this also adds or leads to obesity? People find comfort when they eat, perhaps even moreso when they eat AND watch television/entertainment, possibly leading to over-eating and poor diet. Sort of like classic conditioning. One finds comfort (the reward) in eating and relaxing into suspension (the action/condition) = one most likely continues the actions further.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>you are already on the internet, which is arguably better than watching TV.</p>

<p>TV is a supply-push model, where the consumer is given the illusion of choice because they have a limited number of different channels to choose from, but on each channel is content that is pushed by the supply side. </p>

<p>the internet is demand-pull model, where the consumer actually has real choice of what and when to consume, which links to click, etc. also, the internet allows for commentary on content, so we are able to benefit from the collective wisdom of a much larger pool </p>

<p>we are slowly starting to figure out how all this propaganda works... </p>

<p>on TV, they give you the official story, but its a BIG LIE</p>

<p>online, they give you the alternative story, but its also a BIG LIE</p>

<p>but it doesn&#39;t really matter if you believe what is on TV, or believe what is online, so long as you are distracted with their fiction while the establishment pulls some other sh*t behind our backs. </p>

<p>i finally figured out that the so-called truth-tellers online are part of the program. they may tell you the truth, but only because they know it will cause a rift between you and anyone who believes what was said on TV. and thats the prime objective: divide and conquer. </p>

<p>how else are the so-called truth tellers able to connect so many dots in such a short amount of time, and produce a slick video that lays it all out, basically before the smoke clears? their efficiency is suspicious. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>fair enough</p>

<p>I&#39;m old enough to remember before cable TV, and the deal was that you watch some of their &quot;free&quot; over-the-air programming, in exchange for watching some advertisements within the programs. they actually gave you a fair amount of content for the ads you had to watch</p>

<p>then cable TV came along, and at first the deal was, &quot;pay for cable TV, so you don&#39;t have to watch commercials&quot; because cable was virtually advertisement free, at first.</p>

<p>so everyone piled onto cable TV, and eventually cable started adding more and more ads, in spite of the fact that you were now paying for cable.</p>

<p>i distinctly remember the day i was watching a prime-time TV show, and it seemed to me that id get about 5 minutes of programming to 3 minutes of ads. the ads were so intrusive that i lost the plot of what i was watching every time they went to commercials, which pretty much ruined the show for me. </p>

<p>as is got close to :45, the ads got more frequent and longer. i suspect that they do this because the average watcher is so invested in watching this show that they can abuse them and they will not change the channel, lest they never learn how the story resolves. </p>

<p>but i was done playing that shit. i got up and walked out on the TV show, and never went back to watching TV. recently my SO cut the cable, but unfortunately still watches TV over the air... but at least we are not paying to watch advertisements. </p>

<p>on a completely unrelated note, you ever wonder why cars come stock with an AM/FM one-way radio, instead of a 2-way CB radio?</p>
