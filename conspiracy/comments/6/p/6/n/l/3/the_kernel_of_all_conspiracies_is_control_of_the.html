        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">49</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2017-07-24 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/MrMarmot.html">MrMarmot</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>No matter which piece of the pie you&#39;re looking at – the Rothschilds and banking; Tavistock and social engineering; the political game and vote rigging; corporate corruption and profiteering; war; the murder of smart people; etc., etc., <em>ad infinitum, ad nauseum</em> – the prize is the entire planet earth and humanity under a system of control by a few. </p>

<p>In order to fight this, we can&#39;t play on the game boards they&#39;ve created for us, and the fight requires creativity and creative problem solving. Not law enforcement and courts.</p>

<p>&quot;The Few&quot; have done everything possible to destroy this beautiful creative force that defines humanity on a very fundamental level – through mass poisoning of our food/water/air supply, through chemicals/pharmaceuticals/GMOs, and through the systematic dumbing-down and destruction of the human mind via &quot;education,&quot; media and cultural conditioning. All the posts about the illuminati in the entertainment industry, about fluoride in the water, about all kinds of shit in the vaccines, chemtrails, Fukushima, cancer/chemo/radiation, drug laws, suppression of technology/science, etc. etc. all speak to the destruction of our physical beings and the destruction of reasoning and creativity to those who survive all that, wounded and retarded in ways that we don&#39;t fully know.</p>

<p>So, while we focus on who&#39;s lying about Russia and Trump, etc., we&#39;re not solving our way out of this omnicidal game being played by those who seek to divide us on that issue – and on every other issue they can find that speaks to our cultures, politics, geography, race, religion, heritage and whatever else that can be the focus of our differences and not our common place as human beings on a physical planet.</p>

<p>If their prize is the planet and all of humanity, then that needs to be our prize as well – not just bringing all the child-torturers and traffickers to justice (which will never happen, because those in charge of &quot;justice&quot; are either in on it or suicided), for example. Our  prize needs to be a vision of how this planet works without all of this bullshit, e.g., if there were no money, then the Podestas and the fucking Queen couldn&#39;t pay anyone to go capture children for their dinners and would have to stalk the playgrounds themselves. That wouldn&#39;t last long.</p>

<p>Wrenching global control from the globalists requires creativity and creative problem solving. We have to imagine how it should be, then follow the stages backwards in our minds to where we are now. Then, fill in the gaps with real solutions that bring us in stages towards that end. Yes, IMHO, it has to be global; that&#39;s what they want, so that&#39;s where we have to think. It&#39;s inevitable anyway: the internet and travel have made us more of a global society than at any other time in history, so we have to think across the constructs of nationalism and borders in the same way they do. </p>

<p>If all of us start to spend as much time imagining a new world as we do focusing on the facets that make up this crappy one, it might be possible [I&#39;m lecturing myself as well...]. We have to be both creative and practical to do it. With enough people trying, something will stick, with a quorum to make it happen. It has already started with the incredible spread of information that we&#39;re experiencing, but the one&#39;s seeking control have been thinking beyond this information for a very long time, with Earth and Humanity as the endgame. We have to play the endgame, or they&#39;re going to destroy the entire fucking ecosystem with their inbred and short-sighted tactics. They&#39;ve seen their own folly enough to think they can just move underground if it all goes to hell. </p>

<p>Imagine. What should it be like? What were you born to do? Why is everyone – I mean <em>everyone</em> here – and what would make the world work for all? Imagine the steps to get there, and try to do something towards it. </p>

<p>Posting your ideas here might spark an interaction, but what can you do beyond that and outside of expected means? It might be completely analog and truly personal. The Federal Reserve started as a meeting of a few men on an island. That&#39;s all it takes to create something equally creative on a global scale.</p>

<p>Government and money are the biggest control mechanisms. Imagine new forms that serve the planet and humanity – and figure out how to get from here to there. There are people like Jacques Fresco who have imagined what it could be like, but not imagined how to effectively get there.</p>

<p>I like this sentiment from Steven Greer: &quot;Our goal is not to storm the Pentagon, but to leave it behind.&quot; We have to make the current power structure irrelevant.</p>

<p>I subscribe to a belief system that predicts that we have an 80% chance of destroying ourselves before our own collective consciousness can turn things around. The thing that will throw the ring back into the volcano will be our creativity in undoing the constructs of global control into which we were all born.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDek_YfJLuY">Most of us have seen &quot;The Few&quot; effectively described in this recent vid.</a>, but they&#39;re the ones we need to make most irrelevant, through new ideas that disable the constructs that make their power an an &quot;accepted reality.&quot;</p>

<p>May the universe help us all, and thanks for reading.</p>

<p>This is exactly where we have to get creative, because the path between the present and what you&#39;re envisioning is undefined. We&#39;re so brainwashed into thinking that we need a &quot;leader&quot; and/or even &quot;saviour&quot; do enact any change at all. Thus our &quot;liberty&quot; remains an invisible cage and what passes for &quot;creativity&quot; is cultural refuse and entertainment. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Evil is simply self-serving behavior even at the expense of others. By studying and accepting the existence of beings that don&#39;t respect others in their persuit of self-interest, we learn what we need to do to resist that inevitability. </p>

<p>The elites gain our trust by being seen as protection from evil. They often are the evil and are just tricking us. We have to make better systems and insist on transparency. Tell the elites we&#39;re more afraid of their corruption than we are of the consequences of rampant government and financial transparency. They&#39;ll use our fears (terrorism and competition with other nations) to convince us to allow them more secrecy and power over us. It works if we let them play on our fears like a guitar. Tell them we fear their unchecked power more than death, because life without liberty is not worth living. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>We need a revolution. We start with everyone taking their money out of the bank period. We know physical money only makes up 5% of the entire amount so immediately people will open their eyes to the fact most will not receive their money which proves what they thought was theirs, doesn&#39;t actually exist. 
Before this revolution begins, we need a plan already set in place worldwide or at least North America wide.
We need to create many small communities that consist of every person a working society needs, but of course on a local scale to prevent an unstable, more polluted environment as we see now with mass production. An engineer, farmer, doctor, etc. hell, a person to make shoes even!<br/>
We need to get people to understand all this is possible with renewable energy, collection and filtration of rainwater and that we alone can be sustainable with self education and drive to be set free from the shackles we are bonded on under the &quot;world government&quot; especially with internet; anything is truly possible. To convince people to leave what they think is a comfortable life and to devalue money which they were bred to believe is the most valuable will be the biggest challenge ever. Which is why if we work to create at least one community free of government and is self sustainable, we can truly show the people it will all be worth it. We have to be completely transparent in our process. People will unfortunately die during the revolution, i&#39;m not going to sugarcoat it. These powerful forces will not go down easy at all because after all, all the military is blindly on their side.
I truly hope one day my plan can finally be implemented. Land will no longer belong to anyone one group or individuals and we can finally live one with nature (the natives lived right with nature). Also, I am probably put on their watch list already as my website, my computers, and laptop have already been hacked into which leads me to believe i&#39;m really on to something. Which also leads me to say, take the information I have and do with it as you feel necessary. Thank you for your post. Glad to know there is someone out here who wants a change.</p>
