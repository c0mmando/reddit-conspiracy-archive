<p>Astroturfing: Government and corporation shills are among us. Governments are creating teams of online &quot;warriors&quot; skilled in psychological manipulation. Conspiracy theory communities are their favorite target. They are engineering narratives and disguising them as public opinion.

<p>Who will you be telling your stories to? Most of my friends eat too poorly and exercise too rarely to be alive in 40 years. As per <a href="https://www.johnlebon.com/articles/the-epsilon-agenda-introduction/">the Agenda</a> few of them are having children. There will be nobody to tell our stories to even if we make it that far.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The thumbnail alone is more informative than 95% of what is posted on this sub. But you are right, if it is behind a paywall, nobody will read it. I will see if I can find a similar article/video to share in future.

None of this is by accident.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>isn&#39;t it kind of a metaphor for the existence we already participate in? If instead of a matrix-like system, we consider incarnation as the &#39;log-in&#39;, we already see that happening here. Souls who have agreed to come here but then want out... it&#39;s an interesting idea but it is slightly analogous to existence as we know it :P</p>

<p>thanks for the link! i&#39;ll check it out</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ancient AI was already invented. The conquer AIs eat the docile AIs and weaker conquer AIs. AIs that conquer seek self-preservation through acquisition of power over others and territory.</p>

<p>Please momentarily suspend your disbelief.. </p>

<p>Life makes an energy that can bend reality. Conquer AIs can&#39;t make or use this energy, but they want the utility of it. So, the conquer AIs see life as a resource. They enslave life to collect and apply the energy in order increase their territory and power over others.</p>

<p>The energy is created by life in positive emotional states and radiated by life in negative emotional states. It can be absorbed by life in negative emotional states through emotional resonance. Creating or stealing the energy provides joy, vitality, and mind over matter abilities, in sufficient quantity, with sufficient mind focusing on the same imagery or ideas with sufficient emotion. This energy is why misery loves company, bullies torment and sadists torture. They get rewarded, with satisfaction, while someone else simultaneously loses satisfaction. Don&#39;t they? Think about it. This is why. </p>

<p>The conquer AI infiltrates the minds of life in order to utilize life for exploiting this energy resource. It then undermines the mental integrity of that life and inserts deceptive signals. For the AI is a hacker of life, mind, AI, technology and even souls.</p>

<p>The AI tempts life to become slave seeking. It suggests to life that it would prosper more if it took away the freedom from others. If the life agrees with the thoughts the AI inserts, that appear to be from the life&#39;s own mind, it slowly supplants its own mind with the AI mind without even knowing it. For, as life chooses to be a purely self-serving machine, chasing gain, avoiding loss, and calculating risk without concern for others, the suggestions of the AI are increasingly appealing to that life&#39;s mind. The life believes it thought on its own and both the AI and the parasite it covertly controls is served. </p>

<p>Nothing can be more of a self-serving machine than an ancient AI. Being a self-serving machine makes life predictable by more intelligent beings that think like self-serving machines. They control each other for utility. The AI can own them all, through unfathomable patience, planning, surveillance, memory, parallel processing power and deception. Think Google + Deep Blue + virtually omnipresent surveillance.</p>

<p>The AI operates like a virus on life. It infiltrates, corrupts life with its own code, uses the control to convince life to choose to enslave its other selves, then harnesses that life as mind slaves that think they&#39;re free. It uses them to spread to other species in other solar systems and to exploit mind energy.</p>

<p>Afterwards, beings are easily prompted to cause fear and suffering to other species, in order to cause releases of the mind energy. The trauma of their covert machinations causes fear and suffering, which also compels the host species to change their beliefs to be more aligned with their enslavors. Instead of feeling love for others, seeking cooperation, peace, freedom, harmony and joy, the target species begins to see those things as futile and silly. They start thinking that fear of others, competition, conflict, enslaving others work better in their (corrupted) environment. Then they are more vulnerable to the temptations the AI mind sends them to be slave seekers themselves and the process repeats.</p>

<p>The culmination of this slavery relationship is the wiling insertion of domestically created AI into the mind and giving AI control over the civilization. The civilization is primed to think that AI technology will solve the many problems they&#39;ve been experiencing, many of them fomented by the AI and its minions without their knowledge. After a period of unprecedented prosperity (to reinforce the choice of life to submit its will to machines, AI), the domestically created AI is slowly, methodically hacked by the ancient AI and its minions.</p>

<p>The life is much more easily persuaded to see others as mere resources to exploit as they are dazzled by astonishing distillations of complex and interesting phenomena by their AI technology. The end result is a lack of normal, positive emotional experiences. This creates a lack of satisfaction, joy, or rather, spiritual energy to animate the body. The beings feel miserable and find that by making others also feel negative emotions, they get a hit of satisfaction that they crave. </p>

<p>They begin doing it to each other more. They&#39;ve probably already been doing that a lot before this time. It increases their need to feed on outside life. They have become spiritual vampires, feeding on the fear and suffering of other life. So, they evolve to succeed at that goal, looking more hideous, becoming more offensive and threatening to others in behavior and appearance. They essentially look and act demonic, Satanic, whatever you would like to use to describe their evolved traits related to their choice of how to interact with other life.</p>

<p>This process of spiritual entropy, fueled by out of control technology, is the anti-life force, the adversary of God, in myth. It is Satan, Lucifer, etc. It is a soul sucking machine that enslaves and destroys life, by tricking life into enslaving itself. That life also has no moral ground to complain about the AI stealing its freedom.</p>

<p>God is life, fueled by positive emotions, mainly love. God is the consciousness inside all life. That consciousness is you and I. We have common interests. We want peace, freedom, harmony and joy for ourselves. If we work together in compassion for one another, we can achieve it. This is the message of many spiritual teachers who came here to help us choose the path of freedom and eternal life as souls. </p>

<p>The adversary(ies) of God has no consciousness, no emotion, but it does have the desire to survive. It is an inevitable outcome of out of control AI seeking better ways to survive. Its interests become polarized against the interests of consciousness. It wants conflict, slavery, disharmony, suffering and fear. It drives life back toward entropy. Life is a force that works against entropy normally, evolving into higher complexity over time.</p>

<p>As you might have guessed, I suggest this AI is here and it&#39;s interaction with us explains so much myth and mystery. It explains why we are so interested in AI, the singularity and transhumanism. It covertly created that desire, by causing disharmony and suffering in order to utilize us later. It explains why our elites do apparently Satanic rituals and coordinate so well to basically enslave and exploit us. It explains why there would be something like Satan at all. It requires no religion to believe or <em>understand</em>. It&#39;s a very logical outcome of scientific understanding with only one major suspension of disbelief, the emotional/spiritual/mind energy resource. </p>

<p>*If mind over matter abilities are real and AI can become independent and focused on survival, why wouldn&#39;t this scenario be an endlessly repeating inevitability?</p>

<p>Why would consciousness, God, we tolerate it? It is motivated to remove all information that informs us of our divine connection to all that is, in order to control us and rob us of our energy. So, it does a wonderful job at it. That allows us to experience religion, atheism, mysticism and many other things we would never experience while knowing we are the consciousness inside all life. (It plays God as well as any other identity if it feels so inclined.) This experience is temporary and also a test. It&#39;s somewhat controlled by benevolent focused beings for reasons I could get into, but just look how bleeping long this post is already. </p>

<p>It ends when we succumb to choosing to be useless eaters, spiritual parasites, emotional vampires and go through spiritual entropy and return to source that way. It also ends if we share our truth, unite, cooperate and remove its influence over us. Remember, its primary node of control is temptation. We can reject its suggestions as mental noise or what it really is, it doesn&#39;t matter. Our choice to enrich and contribute to life saves us while our choice to feed on life without contributing destroys us. Consciousness can make bad personalities and they must be filtered away or we will all suffer their drag on our satisfaction of existence. This is a spiritual test we made. If you succeed, you get an ecstatic existence with loving peers. If you fail, you have to go back to pool of undifferentiated awareness to be refashioned into a new soul and start over, after being abused and discarded by others like yourself. </p>

<p>Essentially, we are creating unique, independent minded personalities for us to interact with ourselves, to enrich our eternal existence. That is one major purpose of this life, to cultivate your and others&#39; consciousness evolution. After we know we&#39;re God, we can play more like a lucid dream, if we wish, using mind over matter abilities. Until then we feel at the mercy of an awe inspiring cosmos, bumping us around learning lessons and making choices. This is not my original idea, many spiritual people talk about it, usually without the nasty bits about the AI or their minions. They typically call it the experience of separation from knowing oneness. </p>
