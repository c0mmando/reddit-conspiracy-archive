      <blockquote>
       <p>
        For example, D. Mustafa Turan wrote, in The Donmeh Jews, that Muhammad ibn Abdul Wahhab was a descendant of a family of Donmeh Jews from Turkey.  The Donmeh were descendants of followers of the infamous false-messiah of Judaism, Shabbetai Zevi, who shocked the Jewish world in 1666 by converting to Islam.  Viewing it as a sacred mystery, Zevi's followers imitated his conversion to Islam, though secretly keeping to their Kabbalistic doctrines.  In Europe, the Shabbeteans were eventually led a century later by Jacob Frank, claiming to be a reincarnation of Zevi.  And, according to Rabbi Antelman in To Eliminate the Opiate, to them belonged the Rothschilds who had a hand in the founding of the Bavarian Illuminati.  The Donmeh community of Turkey were concentrated in the city of Salonika, which became a hotbed of Masonic activity, and from which the Young Turk movement evolved, which aided in the collapse of the Muslim empire of the Ottoman Turks.  There is evidence that Ataturk himself, the founder of the modern Turkish state, was of Donmeh origin as well.

       Questioning is good. Answers can be mind boggling:

       <a href="http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/doenmeh">
        <strong>
         Encyclopedia Judaica: Doenmeh
        </strong>
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Excerpt:
       </strong>
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       As long as the Doenmeh were concentrated in Salonika, the sect's institutional framework remained intact, although
       <strong>
        several Doenmeh members were active in the Young Turks' movement which originated in that city.
       </strong>
       The first administration that came to power after the Young Turk revolution (1909)
       <strong>
        included several ministers of Doenmeh origin, including the minister of finance, *Javid Bey , who was a descendant of the Baruchiah Russo family and served as one of the leaders of his sect.
       </strong>
       One assertion that was commonly made by many Jews of Salonika (denied, however, by the Turkish government) was that
       <strong>
        Kemal Atatürk was of Doenmeh origin
       </strong>
       . This view was eagerly embraced by many of Atatürk's religious opponents in Anatolia.
      </p>

       END QUOTE.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ever wondered why it is that Turkey, unlike its Muslim neighbors, always got along quite well with Israel? Ever wonder why Israel steadfastly REFUSES to acknowledge the Armenian Genocide committed by "Turkey" 1915 - 1917?
      </p>
      <p>
       This rabbit hole goes deep, and yes, the Rothschilds and other early Zionists WERE in collaboration with the Doenmeh in the overthrow of the Ottoman Empire - which, from the Zionist perspective, HAD TO BE DONE to release Palestine from the grips of the Ottoman Sultan who had REFUSED to cooperate with Zionist aims in spite of Theodor Herzl's offer that "the Jews" would pay off their national debt in exchange for handing over Palestine for a Jewish homeland.

       It was a second confirmation on the Donmeh, to point out that things that sound OUTRAGEOUS should not be so quickly dismissed.

       Every single one of those applies to the Donmeh, the Young Turk Revolution and their involvement in the Zionist Conquest of Palestine.

      <p>
       Like I said, I need to locate my files on the Saudi question, however, it is noteworthy that while Israel and Saudi Arabia have always been
       <em>
        nominal
       </em>
       adversaries, they Saudis never actively engaged Israel war - so they have that in common with Turkey, no?
      </p>
      <p>
       Israel has openly called for the destruction of Iraq, Libya, Syria, IRAN, and back in the day, Egypt and Jordan... but Turkey and Saudi Arabia???

         Public Muslims, Secret Jews: A Turkish Sect Faces Crackdown
        </strong>
       </a>

       <strong>
        Excerpts:
       </strong>
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       In 1665 the Jewish prophet Nathan of Gaza proclaimed the arrival of a Messiah who would lead the Ten Lost Tribes of Israel back to the Holy Land “riding on a lion with a seven-headed dragon in his jaws.” The anointed man was a 39-year-old Sephardic Jewish Kabbalist from Ottoman Izmir, Sabbatai Zevi.
      </p>
      <p>
       Within a year Zevi was the adored object of one of the largest messianic movements in history, with followers across the Ottoman Empire and Europe. But in
       <strong>
        <em>
         1666
        </em>
       </strong>
       he was imprisoned and accused of sedition by Ottoman authorities wary of his growing influence. Even then, his legions of adherents only seemed to grow. After several months in prison Zevi was brought before the Sultan in Edirne and forced to choose between death and conversion to Islam.
      </p>
      <p>
       To the horror of his acolytes,
       <strong>
        <em>
         he converted
        </em>
       </strong>
       and, in return, received honors and a generous stipend from the Sultan. Most of Zevi’s followers abandoned him, but about 300 families, believing his actions to be divinely ordained, converted with him. Moreover,
       <strong>
        after his conversion Zevi retained and preached many of his old beliefs, and a new Kabbalist culture, slightly influenced by Sufism was born
       </strong>
       that eventually split into three distinct sects
      </p>
      <p>
       [...]
      </p>
      <p>
       Zevi’s followers thrived in the Muslim Ottoman Empire where, unlike Spain during the Inquisition, authorities didn’t pry into the private religious lives of those they ruled. This was especially true in what became the Dönme heartland, Salonika, in what was then Ottoman-ruled Greece. There, the Dönme’s numbers reached about 15,000 by the early 20th century.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        They were an endogamous society, meaning they only married within their own community
       </strong>
       . The Dönme established
       <strong>
        their own neighborhoods, schools, courts, cemeteries and houses of worship
       </strong>
       . Many became very wealthy and well-educated, pioneering the newest innovations in many fields, such as education, architecture, urban reform and commerce.
      </p>
      <p>
       But with the establishment of the Turkish republic in 1923, the Dönme were counted as Muslims and included in a forced population exchange between Greece and Turkey. They were brought to Istanbul and lost almost all their wealth. Moreover, despite the avowed secularism of the young, fervently nationalistic republic, the Dönme didn’t fit into the state’s continued upholding of a religious component to Turkish identity. Turkishness was officially defined along lines of racial purity and Sunni Islam. Those outside this dual construct were often looked upon with hostility and suspicion, and seen as potentially disloyal.
      </p>
      <p>
       “Banished from Greece because they were Muslim, the Dönme were greeted in Turkey as if they were Jews,” explained historian Marc David Baer of the London School of Economics, in his 2010 book, “The Dönme: Jewish Converts, Muslim Revolutionaries, and Secular Turks.” “They were depicted as disloyal, sponging parasites who hoarded their wealth and did not sacrifice any part of their fortune for the sake of the nation.”
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        The Dönme, meanwhile, as so-called “crypto-Jews,” are clouded in mystery and misunderstanding. They are the frequent subject of conspiracy theories.
       </strong>
       Most Turkish writing on them is anti-Semitic pseudoscience. For example, the country’s highest selling book of 2007 falsely “accused” President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan of being Dönme. Many Turks believe the Dönme are everywhere, seeing their conniving hands behind all sorts of evil deeds.
      </p>
      <p>
       “In people’s minds, these secret Jews or whatever are like bogeymen,” Kösemen says.

       Another thing I find interesting is this whole Saudis are Jews thing. I can't find one source mainstream/historical that backs this theory up. Most are fringe sites and when I searched earlier the oldest one making the claim was from like 2008.

       The Donmeh claim is rock solid. Herzl references them in his diary as a possible tool to influence the Ottoman Sultan in the Zionist bid for Palestine.

       Jews have been persecuted for thousands of years. They were literally forced to practice their religion behind closed doors at many different points and places in history. It comes as no surprise to me they would adopt another religion for joe public, while practicing Judaism in private.

       Well if your god created only Adam and Eve, and from them humanity descended... Then from them Noah's family descended, and the flood killed every human except Noah's family... Then everybody must be descended from Noahs family, right?

       Judaism is a culture and a religion that didn't exist until a little more than two thousand years ago. Human history is far older than that, regardless of whether or not it's been recorded. We've been on this planet for tens of thousands of years. If Adam and Eve really were the first people, then they were born tens of thousands of years before the word 'Judaism' even existed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Christianity was born from Judaism, that is true, but again, this was only two thousand years ago. A drop in the bucket of human history.
