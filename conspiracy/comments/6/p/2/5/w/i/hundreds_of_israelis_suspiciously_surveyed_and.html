       We've debated it a lot here over the years.  I have long believed there were mini nukes in the foundation to destabilize the structure.  There seems to be evidence of thermite being used but they may have used some type of sonic oscillators to shatter the bulk of the buildings as they came down, because Judy Wood is right about one thing...there should have been more debris.  Someone recently posted the series finale of Wonder Woman from 1979 that was possibly predictive programming for the "conspiracy 30 years in the making".

       Yep the Art Students are guilty as fuck.

        911 was a cheap magic trick - only bad magicians use CG. Want proof that CG footage was used?

        A Pentagon employee crawled through the hole and saw no evidence of a plane:

        Major General Stubblebine confirms that the wreckage at the pentagon is consistent with a missile and not a plane:

        This WTC witness insists it was a bomb, no plane:

        </a>
       </p>
       <p>
        These firemen said they counted 3 explosions. The Police/FBI are reported to have attributed this to vans with explosives in the WTC basement:
       </p>
       <p>
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfxkcBmZfK0">

        </a>
       </p>
       <p>
        You can also see raw footage (ie. not altered to show a CG plane) that shows the missile impacting the WTC (no plane):
       </p>
       <p>
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wF74zTLjNg">
         https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wF74zTLjNg
        </a>
       </p>
       <p>
        You can see a comparison showing the NBC footage showing no plane was digitally altered to show a plane (as well as adjust the colors to make the buildings appeared white and sky blue for increased psychological impact):
       </p>
       <p>
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPKq2K2dh6k">
         https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPKq2K2dh6k
        </a>
       </p>
       <p>
        The altered footage in some cases is obviously fake, for example tiling smoke:
       </p>
       <p>
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkzfKRe0gbc">
         https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkzfKRe0gbc
        </a>
       </p>
       <p>
        But what wasn't CG was the explosions and the plane cutout shape they created. You can see those small explosions here (6 minute mark):
       </p>
       <p>
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rT1z90BB8E4&amp;amp;feature=endscreen&amp;amp;NR=1">
         https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rT1z90BB8E4&amp;amp;feature=endscreen&amp;amp;NR=1
        </a>
       </p>
       <p>
        The cutting charges were planted by Israeli Mossad posing as art students who rented a whole floor and got construction permits at the site, and made a temporary balcony. They even made a book about their "art" - which showed them standing next to boxes and boxes of explosives fuses in the WTC!
       </p>

       </p>
       <p>
        Mossad agents filmed the missile impacts/explosions (to add CG planes later and pass on to media) and later went up to the roof to plant radio jamming devices. They were arrested and this is documented by the FBI. There was traces of explosives in their van and they were set up filming BEFORE the attack:

        </a>
       </p>
       <p>
        Let me stress that again, the FBI arrested dancing Israelis on 911, not muslims. They refused to take lie detector tests for months, and when they did, they failed. So much of that FBI report is redacted, proof positive of guilt.
       </p>

        They needed to fake plane impacts because a real plane would be shredded by the WTC like cheese through a grater. That's why when the Transasia plane collided with a taxi, the wing broke off, and the taxi wasn't sliced in half at all:
       </p>

        </a>
       </p>
       <p>
        According to a WTC architect in a 80s interview, the impact of a plane (300 tonnes) is nothing compared to the 13,000 tonnes of force trying to push the WTC over simply because of its enormous surface area.

        WTC project management engineer atttests the buildings could survive multiple plane impacts.

        The WTC designers did a study for 600mph-1 impact which showed the towers would easily withstand the 911 attack.

        Someone planted an engine (though wrong make) to further the plane deception:

        </a>
       </p>
       <p>
        Essentially the media got punked by Israel, because journalists just report what they're told. You can see another example of newscasters being fooled by a movie set into thinking it's a real plane accident. At the 7 minute mark in this video:
       </p>

        The larger 911 plan required the destruction of the Washington bridge and Lincoln tunnel. That would take out the fiber optic cables linked to stock market/banking, markets would have crashed and there would be martial law introduced. You can see this TV report on the other Israeli vans that were intercepted, one of them exploded:

        </a>
       </p>
       <p>
        Israeli companies moved out of the building months before the attack. Israelis in America were warned in advance through an Israeli messaging service:
       </p>
       <p>
        <a href="http://www.haaretz.com/odigo-says-workers-were-warned-of-attack-1.70579">
         http://www.haaretz.com/odigo-says-workers-were-warned-of-attack-1.70579
        </a>
       </p>
       <p>
        Hundreds of Israelis were flown out of America, despite a flight ban, to avoid them being arrested by the FBI, including the "art students":

        Israel is the almost only country that benefited from the September 11 th attacks. In the words of Netanyahu, "it's good for Israel".

       No art students rented out the entire 91st floor. There were various sponsored art projects going on at the floor with different groups. The ones people are most suspicious of are Austrians, not Israelis, but you get downvoted for pointing that out.
