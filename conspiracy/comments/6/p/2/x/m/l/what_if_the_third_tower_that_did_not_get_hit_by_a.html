    <div class="md"><p>You mean April 28th? Aka the source listed on the Wikipedia for the paragraph about asbestos?</p>

<p>It seems that the fireproofing they used (which replaced asbestos) was determined to be deficient after the bombings in 1993, and they had only redone 18 floors in WTC 1 and 13 floors in WTC 2 by 9/11/2001.</p>

<p>This is very interesting, thank you for pointing this out to me. Looks like it was more about fireproofing remediation than asbestos. </p>

<p>Wonder why they dragged their feet with the fireproofing for 8 years? You&#39;d think that after your building is attacked by terrorists (1993), you&#39;d want to secure your building as much as possible ASAP.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My simpleton brain says the US wanted to invade Afghanistan to have a foothold and control Afghanistan; part of the &quot;world island&quot;.  I think that had to do with the emergence of SCO:</p>

<p>The Shanghai Five consists of China, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Russia and Tajikistan, and emerged from a series of border demarcation and demilitarization talks which the four former Soviet republics held with China. <strong>Since 1996,..</strong></p>

<p>May 2001 Brookings <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/opinions/shanghai-five-an-attempt-to-counter-u-s-influence-in-asia/">&quot;Shanghai Five: An Attempt to Counter U.S. Influence in Asia?&quot;</a></p>

<p>Heritage, July 2001 <a href="http://www.heritage.org/europe/report/the-russia-china-friendship-and-cooperation-treaty-strategic-shift-eurasia">&quot;The Russia-China Friendship and Cooperation Treaty: A Strategic Shift in Eurasia?&quot;</a></p>

<p>Afghanistan holds observor status to join SCO.  SCO still has problems they need to work out; there&#39;s that thing between China and India right now.  I dunno, but it was imperative for the US to invade Afghanistan which also borders Iran, and there&#39;s that heroin thing too.  It&#39;s the &quot;world island&quot; over there tho. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have been wondering if there&#39;s more to the 9/11 story. It seems that the Pentagon was hit with a missile, judging from the damage that was done to one of the inner walls:</p>

<p><a href="https://truthandshadows.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/pentagon-inside-hole1.jpg?w=620">https://truthandshadows.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/pentagon-inside-hole1.jpg?w=620</a></p>

<p>Mayor General Stubblebine also thinks a missile hit the Pentagon.</p>

<p>But why a missile? And why is there no footage of the plane? Why was all camera footage confiscated? When it comes to the Twin Towers there&#39;s plenty of footage of planes, so why not the Pentagon?</p>

<p>Maybe white hats in the administration responded to the Twin Tower attacks by attacking the Pentagon and maybe even shooting down the Shanksville plane?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;white house was the target&quot; company line seems like another in the litany of decoy stories. if the conspiracy truly intended to crash the w.h. , but this possible minor breakdown in the overarching plan would be extremely fortunate, as far as &quot;change of plans&quot; / &quot;plan b, plan c&quot; considerations. crashing the w.h. would be extra extra damaging to citizen morale BUT, it would also open up another economy can of worms to feed the relentless false flag researchers. So many more potential points of failure would be created which eagle eye experts could add to the list of contradictions. For all i know the ridiculous shanksville feature film was planned in advance alongside the nukes, thermite, key media contacts etc. The isolated account of the brave passengers and the supposed dialogue recorded sonehow or other dovetail nicely into the theatrics of the entire secret plan</p>

<p>If we assume <em>arguendo</em> that the plane was being controlled remotely at this point, a communications or navigation failure at the point they changed heading could have led to the crash, or led to the plane being ordered shot down.</p>

<p>Also, I have a friend who works for a certain agency that put the WTC-7 thing in perspective for me. It didn&#39;t fall until much much later in the day, and apparently the foundation was compromised. I never realized how close WTC-7 was to the other two.

    <div class="md"><p>Why doesn&#39;t it fit?  </p>

<p>The basic assumption is, that WTC7 was demolished. 
Whether that actually holds true is a fight one can take up with NIST, together or against, but for discussions in here?<br/>
Within the realms of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, that is a given for me.<br/>
YMMV.  </p>

<p>So the only discussion worthy point is WHY. Where is the motive? What is the plan?<br/>
I mean, people come up with an intricate plan to blow up a 47 story building. Months/years of preparation in total secrecy. And the best explanation we get is an office fire and a single column number?<br/>
A colander like story a school teacher with a physics book can refute?  </p>

<p>Something that day didn&#39;t went as planned, and a this is a good explanation. What&#39;s yours?</p>

<pre><code>Wallace Miller is the coroner of Somerset County, Pennsylvania. He was among the first people to arrive at the alleged Flight 93 crash site on the morning of 9/11.

I stopped being coroner after about 20 minutes, because there were no bodies there.

    <div class="md"><p>I mean this is a joke, what they really need to outlaw is 911 truth. I&#39;m sure they do that next.</p>

<p>911 was a cheap magic trick - only bad magicians use CG. Want proof that CG footage was used?</p>

<p>A Pentagon employee crawled through the hole and saw no evidence of a plane:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIy9hjB3DGk">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIy9hjB3DGk</a></p>

<p>Major General Stubblebine confirms that the wreckage at the pentagon is consistent with a missile and not a plane:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jc1ql4TfCZw">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jc1ql4TfCZw</a></p>

<p>This WTC witness insists it was a bomb, no plane:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bq1-BCeNcm0">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bq1-BCeNcm0</a></p>

<p>These firemen said they counted 3 explosions. The Police/FBI are reported to have attributed this to vans with explosives in the WTC basement:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfxkcBmZfK0">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfxkcBmZfK0</a></p>

<p>You can also see raw footage (ie. not altered to show a CG plane) that shows the missile impacting the WTC (no plane):</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wF74zTLjNg">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wF74zTLjNg</a></p>

<p>You can see a comparison showing the NBC footage showing no plane was digitally altered to show a plane (as well as adjust the colors to make the buildings appeared white and sky blue for increased psychological impact):</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPKq2K2dh6k">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPKq2K2dh6k</a></p>

<p>The altered footage in some cases is obviously fake, for example tiling smoke:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkzfKRe0gbc">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkzfKRe0gbc</a></p>

<p>But what wasn&#39;t CG was the explosions and the plane cutout shape they created. You can see those small explosions here (6 minute mark):</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rT1z90BB8E4&amp;amp;feature=endscreen&amp;amp;NR=1">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rT1z90BB8E4&amp;amp;feature=endscreen&amp;amp;NR=1</a></p>

<p>The cutting charges were planted by Israeli Mossad posing as art students who rented a whole floor and got construction permits at the site, and made a temporary balcony. They even made a book about their &quot;art&quot; - which showed them standing next to boxes and boxes of explosives fuses in the WTC!</p>

<p><a href="http://winteractionables.com/?p=25207">http://winteractionables.com/?p=25207</a></p>

<p>Mossad agents filmed the missile impacts/explosions (to add CG planes later and pass on to media) and later went up to the roof to plant radio jamming devices. They were arrested and this is documented by the FBI. There was traces of explosives in their van and they were set up filming BEFORE the attack:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.scribd.com/collections/4010452/9-11-The-Dancing-Israelis-FBI-report">https://www.scribd.com/collections/4010452/9-11-The-Dancing-Israelis-FBI-report</a></p>

<p>Let me stress that again, the FBI arrested dancing Israelis on 911, not muslims. They refused to take lie detector tests for months, and when they did, they failed. So much of that FBI report is redacted, proof positive of guilt.</p>

<p>They needed to fake plane impacts because a real plane would be shredded by the WTC like cheese through a grater. That&#39;s why when the Transasia plane collided with a taxi, the wing broke off, and the taxi wasn&#39;t sliced in half at all:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQ29Zr7wWnw">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQ29Zr7wWnw</a></p>

<p>According to a WTC architect in a 80s interview, the impact of a plane (300 tonnes) is nothing compared to the 13,000 tonnes of force trying to push the WTC over simply because of its enormous surface area.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E15GbdVaV-Q">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E15GbdVaV-Q</a></p>

<p>WTC project management engineer atttests the buildings could survive multiple plane impacts.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fQlC2AIWrY">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fQlC2AIWrY</a></p>

<p>The WTC designers did a study for 600mph-1 impact which showed the towers would easily withstand the 911 attack.</p>

<p><a href="http://911research.wtc7.net/wtc/analysis/design.html">http://911research.wtc7.net/wtc/analysis/design.html</a></p>

<p>Someone planted an engine (though wrong make) to further the plane deception:</p>

<p><a href="/r/conspiracy/comments/34o4y0/911_engine_that_shot_out_of_the_south_tower_was/">/r/conspiracy/comments/34o4y0/911_engine_that_shot_out_of_the_south_tower_was/</a></p>

<p>Essentially the media got punked by Israel, because journalists just report what they&#39;re told. You can see another example of newscasters being fooled by a movie set into thinking it&#39;s a real plane accident. At the 7 minute mark in this video:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wozTHxykDwQ">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wozTHxykDwQ</a></p>

<p>The larger 911 plan required the destruction of the Washington bridge and Lincoln tunnel. That would take out the fiber optic cables linked to stock market/banking, markets would have crashed and there would be martial law introduced. You can see this TV report on the other Israeli vans that were intercepted, one of them exploded:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmpWe2Rhi_I">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmpWe2Rhi_I</a></p>

<p>Israeli companies moved out of the building months before the attack. Israelis in America were warned in advance through an Israeli messaging service:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.haaretz.com/odigo-says-workers-were-warned-of-attack-1.70579">http://www.haaretz.com/odigo-says-workers-were-warned-of-attack-1.70579</a></p>

<p>Hundreds of Israelis were flown out of America, despite a flight ban, to avoid them being arrested by the FBI, including the &quot;art students&quot;:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/israel/1387069/US-arrests-200-young-Israelis-in-spying-investigation.html">http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/israel/1387069/US-arrests-200-young-Israelis-in-spying-investigation.html</a></p>

<p>Israel is the almost only country that benefited from the September 11 th attacks. In the words of Netanyahu, &quot;it&#39;s good for Israel&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why hit it with a plane though? All the buildings neighbouring the WTC site suffered some noticeable damage from the destruction of the twin towers. From a statistical point of view, the probability of any building not collapsing when suffering any kind of structural damage is not 100%. Most people that followed the details closely enough to know that building 7 collapsed believe splash damage from the twin towers was sufficient to destroy it.</p>

<p>The destruction of building 7 was inconspicuous so there wasn&#39;t a lot of attention on it making details about it easier to hide. Imagine how much publicity building 7&#39;s destruction would have received if it was also hit by a plane. Covering up any wrong doing in that building would have been even more difficult.</p>

<p>Also, load up flight simulator, pick a random 50 floor high skyscraper in Manhattan and try to hit it on your first try. Notice how many similarly sized  building are blocking your target.</p>

<p>Let me stress that again, the FBI arrested dancing Israelis on 911, not muslims. They refused to take lie detector tests for months, and when they did, they failed. So much of that FBI report is redacted, proof positive of guilt.</p>

<p>They needed to fake plane impacts because a real plane would be shredded by the WTC like cheese through a grater. That&#39;s why when the Transasia plane collided with a taxi, the wing broke off, and the taxi wasn&#39;t sliced in half at all:</p>

<p>According to a WTC architect in a 80s interview, the impact of a plane (300 tonnes) is nothing compared to the 13,000 tonnes of force trying to push the WTC over simply because of its enormous surface area.</p>

<p>Essentially the media got punked by Israel, because journalists just report what they&#39;re told. You can see another example of newscasters being fooled by a movie set into thinking it&#39;s a real plane accident. At the 7 minute mark in this video:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wozTHxykDwQ">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wozTHxykDwQ</a></p>

<p>The larger 911 plan required the destruction of the Washington bridge and Lincoln tunnel. That would take out the fiber optic cables linked to stock market/banking, markets would have crashed and there would be martial law introduced. You can see this TV report on the other Israeli vans that were intercepted, one of them exploded:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmpWe2Rhi_I">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmpWe2Rhi_I</a></p>

<p>Israeli companies moved out of the building months before the attack. Israelis in America were warned in advance through an Israeli messaging service:</p>

<p>Hundreds of Israelis were flown out of America, despite a flight ban, to avoid them being arrested by the FBI, including the &quot;art students&quot;:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/israel/1387069/US-arrests-200-young-Israelis-in-spying-investigation.html">http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/israel/1387069/US-arrests-200-young-Israelis-in-spying-investigation.html</a></p>

<p>Israel is the almost only country that benefited from the September 11 th attacks. In the words of Netanyahu, &quot;it&#39;s good for Israel&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is probably going to get me heavily downvoted, but if that where true, WHY would they let the bombs go off if the pain that was supposed to hit the third building never arrived?</p>

<p>Look at it this way. They planted bombs they planned to use for when the plane hit, but it never did. So what did they do? Let them go off anyway? Why? With no cover up, wouldn&#39;t that be really stupid and obvious?</p>

<p>Unless you are suggesting they used a timed explosive, which again is WAY too stupid for a conspiracy of this measure. If something went wrong (which it did according to this conspiracy) a bomb would go off with NO COVER, and that would ruin the whole conspiracy. Nah, if they did use bombs, they&#39;d be triggered, not timed.</p>

<p>Sorry, I don&#39;t believe this theory, because I don&#39;t believe the people trying to make a conspiracy THIS LARGE would ever be dumb enough to leave so much up to chance.</p>

<p>Essentially the media got punked by Israel, because journalists just report what they&#39;re told. You can see another example of newscasters being fooled by a movie set into thinking it&#39;s a real plane accident. At the 7 minute mark in this video:</p>

<p>The larger 911 plan required the destruction of the Washington bridge and Lincoln tunnel. That would take out the fiber optic cables linked to stock market/banking, markets would have crashed and there would be martial law introduced. You can see this TV report on the other Israeli vans that were intercepted, one of them exploded:</p>

<p>Israeli companies moved out of the building months before the attack. Israelis in America were warned in advance through an Israeli messaging service:</p>

<p>Hundreds of Israelis were flown out of America, despite a flight ban, to avoid them being arrested by the FBI, including the &quot;art students&quot;:</p>

<p>Israel is the almost only country that benefited from the September 11 th attacks. In the words of Netanyahu, &quot;it&#39;s good for Israel&quot;.</p>
