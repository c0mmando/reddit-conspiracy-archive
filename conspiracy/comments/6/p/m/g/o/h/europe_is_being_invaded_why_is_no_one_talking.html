For such a huge and powerful country, being afraid of such a small number of people would normally be embarrassing ... it&#39;s funny that Polish people are so afraid of people that don&#39;t even want to be in their country.</p>

I speak from  experience and i know how they deliberately pretend to be someone they are not and how those who are not involved with terorist plots know about them and dont snitch.I know what they say behind close doors and their long term plans.You know only what they tell you on stupid TV and biased in formation all over internet.Go and live with muslims, for a year, do business with them, choose one of those neighbourhoods where law abiding citizens live with their 5 drug dealing sons and where polce dont go.Then after that year, come back to me. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>They dont know of terorist plots details but they do know who is involved with fundamentalism and while some may snitch most do not. I never said everybody knows the detail of whats going on but yes everybody knows who is who and they saty quiet about it because of fear, family ties, or because they secretely support terrorism. You probably know they say they will conquer France with the bellies of their women, their tactics to make french people businesses fail, you must know that this is real and what the atmosphere is.Why did you leave the muslim neighborhood?

<p>Cars kill more people than terrorists.  More people are killed by accidental gunshots than terrorists.  Bikes are more dangerous to ride than  terrorists.  Do you have an irrational hateful fear of all these things as well?</p>

<p>Because Europe and America stirred the pot in countries they had no business interfering in.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Because they don&#39;t want to be treated like slaves or cattle?  Some are looking to stay in places that are safer and provide more opportunities?  Others are staying only until things back home get better (hence the 500,000 refugees returning to Syria in 2017)?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>what are you defending really?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A genuine concern for other humans without the fear-mongering perpetuated by cowards which only makes things worse?</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I actually live in Europe, so I&#39;m able to formulate my own opinions regarding the issue, thank you.</p>

<p>War is the reason for these refugees, why would I be pushing for more of the same???</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As a European: Yes there is tension. Yes, there was a very strong influx of African migrants and refugees in recent years that became overwhelming at times. Most of this influx has died down or receded. Yes, Italy, Spain, and Greece still bear the brunt of the burden, and are negotiating aggressively for other EU nations to take on a bigger share.</p>

<p>None of this situation is ideal, and many are using these tensions for their own purpose. None of that means that Europe is actually being invaded or overrun as you allude to. None of that is set in stone, and most of it is actively counteracted by now. It&#39;s not a good situation, but it is by no means as catastrophic as you make it out to be.</p>

<p>And lastly, yes, there are very clear problems within the modern Muslim community of migrants that are incompatible with Western culture and need to be resolved if we want to ease those tensions. It&#39;s a challenge, not a dead end. At least I think so.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Migrant arrivals in Italy have indeed gone up since the eastern route to central Europe via Turkey, Greece, Kroatia, etc. has been mostly closed down.</p>

<p><a href="http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Asylum_statistics">Arrivals, in general, across Europe have consistently been going down since early 2016.</a></p>

<p>Just to make that clear, I&#39;m not saying there&#39;s nothing to see here. It&#39;s certainly a crisis, and it could certainly get out of hand, and it can certainly be used by powerful players – like any crisis can – to achieve clandestine goals. But I&#39;m equally convinced that you&#39;re tremendously exaggerating the current conditions.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a struggle at this point, not a loss. Whether or not it becomes a loss is indeed a question of taking a stand though, so we may agree that it&#39;s an issue worth talking about, just not one that&#39;s worth freaking out over.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s no war, but there is debt, terrorism and corruption. </p>

<p>Debt leads to foreign corporations stealing African resources. Resources that could be used on infrastructure for African folk. The leaders of countries like Nigeria are in the pocket of the rich in Europe and the US - &gt; corruption. Then you have terrorist groups, who again are funded by groups outside of Africa. All of these put together (and more) result in shitty living conditions for most Africans, with shitty infrastructure for the poor, whilst the rich live the good life. Its like the situation in the US, but amplified by 1000. They also have a reason to come to Europe. They aren&#39;t allowed access to their own resources. They don&#39;t have infrastructure. They amidst violence and poverty, day in, day out. </p>

<p>Things are slowly changing in parts of Africa (Nigeria is actually one of those countries), but rampant inequality is still there. You&#39;re gonna have the poor folk of these places head to Europe. But then, the elite are causing this blatant inequality -&gt; this provides a good reason for migrants to head to Europe. Same with war. In the end, the elite profit from suffering, and others suffer as a result of initial suffering. </p>

<p>Nonsense.</p>

<p>Every tribal culture begi s with might makes right.</p>

<p>A stidy of the native american population in north america before europeans arrived was a study in constant brutal international (tribal) warfare and brutality and a culture which rewarded the person who shed the most blood. Anything else is a xDances with Wolves&quot; Hollywood fictional rewrite of history.</p>

<p>And it was the same in Africa. In Japan. In China. Just about everywhere. Its still that way anywher in the middleeast where a us installed strongman isnt in power. And when the strongman is gone they stsrt wiping each other out in the worst ways imaginable again.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Might makes right is Meritocracy. Function. </p>

<p>None were Native? Then that means Europeans aren&#39;t Native either. So why are you complaining?  </p>

<p>That is intrensically Fake News. You&#39;re distilling thousands of different cultures that existed thousands of years with vast and radical government systems into one set Fake News system. </p>

<p>Here is an example of a MesoAmerican Democracy: <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2017/03/it-wasnt-just-greece-archaeologists-find-early-democratic-societies-americas">http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2017/03/it-wasnt-just-greece-archaeologists-find-early-democratic-societies-americas</a></p>

<p>In fact most were not governed by complete rulers, but rather heads of state voted on by Councils of Elders representing each district. The MesoAmerican framework very much resembles the trilateral system of today with the council of judges, council of elders, and head of state. Incompetent leaders could even be disposed of or lose their right to govern. It was not liniage based. </p>

<p>Another example of an ideal rule was the Taino system in the carribean. </p>

<p>The Inca empire, which eradicating hunger, was also a very effective system. </p>

<p>And no, not same in China, Africa, Japan. These as well had a rich bevy of different systems that heavily changed throughout the ages. </p>

<p>Hawaii as well had a much more representative system. Now Hawaiians in Kingdom of Hawaii have zero power and are under complete control of the mainland. </p>

<p>You mention the Middle East. The Zoroastrian Persian Empire outlawed slavery and was far more ideal in equality then the West. </p>

<p>So you&#39;ll have to try better then that and actually name specifics. Of course all you Stormies know are Fake News Colonialist (Globalist) propaganda. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dude, I live in Europe, love to travel and have friends from Germany too, saying stuff like this is really ignorant. You are greatly exaggerating the problem and fear mongering isn&#39;t helping anyone. I&#39;m glad you are at least trying to find independent media as political parties here use the immigrant problem to help their own cause. But just because someone is independent, that doesn&#39;t automatically make them more reliable. Europe has more than 700 million people living in it, even if we accept 2-3 million immigrants a year only a fraction of those are problematic, and that is still a very low number. You either think that Europe is very weak or haven&#39;t thought this through.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, OP is right. Whilst our press talks about gimmigrants, they do not actually call it an invasion, which is a very specific proposal; as an invasion is reason for war. Instead they moan and whinge if they are mildly right and tell us that we are all racist if we don&#39;t love the newcomers if they are left.</p>

<p>I think someone should call it what it is so we can start counter measures if we don&#39;t want to lose our civilised ways.
It&#39;s all part of the big plan to dilute/diversify white Europeans.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes I have and I even mentioned it in my post very clearly.
The daily Fail doesn&#39;t call it invasion. They moan about it but I have yet to see a headline stating: UK invaded by Syria/africa/etc</p>

<p>Because, invasion isn&#39;t just a word, it is a legal term. 
If the government accepts that we are being actually invaded rather than welcoming refugees, the gameplan would have to change.</p>

<p>The demographic in even the northern most parts of Sweden has seen a drastic change these past few years, from no &quot;immigrants&quot; to them even being the majority in some parts. All the while our police is being suppressed from doing their actual job, since it&#39;s racist. The government functions that we pay our exceedingly high taxes for are not going towards government functions, that&#39;s for sure. Work and money is quickly loosing it&#39;s value here, prices going up, way less pay per hour of work.
