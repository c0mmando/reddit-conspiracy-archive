        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I didn&#39;t distribute a drug called Factor VIII in the 1980&#39;s tainted with the HIV virus intentionally, infecting and killing thousands of people around the world......</p>

<p>Bayer did that.</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t experiment with the flu vaccine and expose mental patients and prisoners in Michigan to the pandemic virus in 1942......</p>

<p>Jonas Salk and the U.S. Government did that.</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t launch a drug called Vioxx in 1999 while knowing that it increased the risk of fatal heart attacks and strokes before it even hit the market.This drug was responsible for at least 55,000 deaths in America......</p>

<p>Merck did that.</p>

<p>I wasn&#39;t involved in the forced sterilization of immigrants, people of color, poor people,unmarried mothers, the disabled and the mentally ill that spanned 32 States in the first half of the 20th century...</p>

<p>The U.S. Government was.</p>

<p>I wasn&#39;t behind the illegal clinical trial of the drug Trozan in Nigeria in the 1990&#39;s during a meningitis epidemic that left 11 children dead.The Nigerian Government did not authorize this trial and was without parental consent.</p>

<p>Pfizer was.</p>

<p>It wasn&#39;t me that told African American males that they were being treated for &quot;bad blood&quot; after luring them in with free meals,free physicals and free burial insurance. Some of the men had syphilis,others were given the deadly venereal disease.The study was later discovered to be an experiment of syphilis left untreated...</p>

<p>Again, it was the U.S. Government.</p>

<p>I certainly did not publish a flawed study and misled doctors into prescribing the dangerous antidepressant Paxil to children and had the public thinking that it was safe.</p>

<p>That was GlaxoSmithKline.</p>

<p>I was not involved in the 1956-58 U.S. Army experiment involving dropping hundreds of thousands of specially bred mosquitoes to see if they could be used as biological weapons,specifically, yellow fever.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll say it one more time, the U.S. Government was.</p>

<p>Not one of the aforementioned examples here are conspiracy theory, they are factual and verifiable.</p>

<p>We are led to believe these types of things no longer occur, we cannot entrust the pharmaceutical industry through government enforcement to have our best interests in mind.</p>

<p>I did not plant doubt in my mind, their actions did.Their desire to control everything in their sights made me this way.</p>

<p>So, forgive me for not wanting to comply with vaccine mandates, but don&#39;t blame me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>One look at <a href="/r/Parenting">/r/Parenting</a> and its rabid pro-vaccine stance will make you sick. I don&#39;t have kids, but I once looked thru the sub out of curiosity and was blown away by some of the vaccine-related posts, basically calling those who disagree killers and saying they should be removed from society. The amount of brainwashing it takes to comment shit like that is incomprehensible. op, I totally agree with you and thank you, I am sure someone will use this post for valuable copypasta.</p>

I&#39;ve already been banned from <a href="/r/beyondthebump">/r/beyondthebump</a>. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6mfvsv/dont_discuss_vaccines_on_the_popular_babyrearing">https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6mfvsv/dont_discuss_vaccines_on_the_popular_babyrearing</a></p>

<p>You HAVE to have a certain amount of brainwashing to allow your child to be injected over and over and over. And no one wants to believe they&#39;re harming their child, so they double down on the cognitive dissonance. </p>

<p>What they don&#39;t realize is the thousands of parents who claim vaccine injury...they were once pro-vaxxers themselves. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s scary to think you might be doing wrong by your child. It&#39;s scary to think the government might not have your child&#39;s best interest at heart. I understand their fear and their reaction because of it. It&#39;s exactly why they take such an extreme stance on the issue. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve seen many a pro-vaxxers say &quot;I hope your child/children die of a vaccine covered illness,&quot; which goes against the whole principal they are arguing on behalf of. Unfortunately, such a response is common because of the extreme fear they are experiencing when faced with the very real alternative, that vaccines might not be perfect. Intense fear often causes people to become diehard in their beliefs as a means of self preservation. That&#39;s why so many cannot accept anything less than &#39;vaccines being perfectly safe&#39;. Basic logic dictates that is not true, even if you don&#39;t believe in many of the suspected harms caused by vaccines. No pharmaceutical is perfectly safe. Neither is any surgery. </p>

<p>I worry that this type of predominant fear based logic could be hurting us from making vaccines safer and/or finding safer ways to prevent disease. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>my husband&#39;s relatives, who feel the need to critique this issue daily on Facebook, behave this way. thank you for stating it ever so succinctly. I have seen this mentality on reddit as well. </p>

<p>Of course this attitude hurts us in the long run - it prevents people from taking a second look at these very, very serious issues. I can accept, as someone who studied medicine for years, that the premise of vaccines is great. The problem lies with what is actually inside of them [mercury et all]. If we could at least all agree on that, debating this issue - no, discussion of this issue - would be so much simpler.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>While I agree with you, it&#39;s a bit more complicated than that. The mercury is mostly gone now, but there is aluminum in a lot of them. The pathogens are grown in the cells lines of aborted fetuses or animal organ cells. So not only are you reacting to the pathogen but you&#39;re reacting to cell fragments and all kinds of autoimmune causing shit. Then there&#39;s the problem of injecting the pathogen rather than ingesting, because in such a young person you&#39;re creating a Th2 dominance. Check out YouTube videos by Dr. Suzanne Humphries if you want to learn more. Her lectures are super informative!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow a post by you, of numbers without context or sources. Color me convinced! And you are trying to argue that since correlation doesn&#39;t ALWAYS equal causation therefore there is no connect between these two. There is a direct cause and effect between the polio vaccine and polio in a measurable way that we can say that yes the correlation is causation in this instance.  Just put a graph of polio vaccinations next to a graph of cases of polio you can clearly see the connection. </p>

<p>You need to understand things and not just say them, correlation doesn&#39;t equal causation is used when people say things like I ate chocolate and now my butt hurts, so chocolate makes.my butt hurt. There&#39;s no connection between them so obviously it&#39;s an unrelated phenomenon and simple coincidence. But the polio vaccine is so obviously directly related to polio and when you can clearly see the decrease in polio after the introduction of something designed to fight it, it becomes obvious the two are related.

<p>You can say vaccines cause autism if you want, that&#39;s fine I won&#39;t fight you one that because not enough research has been done on the subject. But you can&#39;t sit here and say vaccines especially the polio vaccine don&#39;t work. They may be NWO mind control or Globalist population control, but they definitely treat the diseases they are made to treat.</p>

But I know what you&#39;re gonna say &quot;herd immunity isn&#39;t  real&quot;,I can&#39;t argue with you on that because that&#39;s just a rejection of reality. but we have measurable data showing clearly that when vaccines are introduced the diseases they treat go down. You can see it when you put a chart of polio vaccinations and polio cases side by side iirc. </p>

<p>And polio is eradicated where vaccines we&#39;re introduced. The only places it holds on are where large amounts of people go unvaccinated. I mean you can see it clear as day. This isn&#39;t me just saying vaccines fix things cuz I said so, there is real mesurable data that agrees with me and you can even look at it yourself. </p>

<p>You&#39;re living in rejection of reality. In rejection of the cold hard truth of mathematics. So unless TPTB have the power to cure and give certain illnesses at will , the data shows vaccines work as intended. </p>

<p>can you cite any credible evidence that supports the narrative that vaccines are responsible for the eradication of small pox? because i could just as easily say that i eradicated small pox with prayers, and point to the eradication of small pox as proof that my prayers worked.  thats basically what the vaccine cult has done.</p>

<p>also, you have utterly failed to present any evidence whatsoever that any vaccine you have ever received has worked for you as intended. at best you can say that you didn&#39;t get a disease you were vaccinated against, but does that really prove the vaccine worked for you? or is it another case of &quot;correlation does not equal causation&quot;, and it was actually my prayers that kept you disease free?</p>

<p>do we really need to wait around for some authority figure to tell us why there is roadkill along the road? or can reasonable people assume that roadkill was killed by traffic?</p>

<p>its the same with autism. we don&#39;t need to wait around for some self-appointed expert to tell us that vaccines cause autism, when we can clearly see thousands of examples just by acknowledging them. thats what the &quot;hear this well&quot; awareness campaign is all about. </p>

<p>please describe the process by which you verified that the vaccines you have been given have worked as intended for you. if you don&#39;t verify your vaccines worked, then you are practicing faith based medicine, not evidence based medicine.  </p>

<p>Correlation doesn&#39;t equal causation unless it&#39;s what I want, is what you should say.</p>

<p>BINGO! this is a big day for both of us! you finally had that &quot;ah ha moment&quot; where you realized that &quot;Correlation doesn&#39;t equal causation unless it&#39;s what I want&quot; is a logical fallacy made by those who rely on this line of reasoning to dismiss the side effects of vaccines. </p>

<p>And i don&#39;t know that it worked for me as an individual because sometimes they don&#39;t work, thats why the concept of herd immunity is important. </p>

<p>faith based medicine is quackery and pseudoscience. vaccines are quackery and pseudoscience.</p>

<p>But I know what you&#39;re gonna say &quot;herd immunity isn&#39;t real&quot;,I can&#39;t argue with you on that because that&#39;s just a rejection of reality. </p>

<p>the &quot;reality&quot; you live in is unique to you alone. those who use the word &quot;reality&quot; falsely assume that their version of reality is the only legitimate reality, and that their unique reality is also somehow the reality of the majority. this is the manifestation of profound delusions of grandeur. </p>

<p>but we have measurable data showing clearly that when vaccines are introduced the diseases they treat go down. You can see it when you put a chart of polio vaccinations and polio cases side by side iirc.</p>

<p>correlation does not equal causation. maybe the diagnoses of polio went down because they started calling it something else, and passed off this slight-of-hand as a victory for vaccine science </p>

<blockquote>
<p>And polio is eradicated where vaccines we&#39;re introduced. The only places it holds on are where large amounts of people go unvaccinated. I mean you can see it clear as day. This isn&#39;t me just saying vaccines fix things cuz I said so, there is real mesurable data that agrees with me and you can even look at it yourself.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>with your example, you just debunked the myth that the small pox vaccine eradicated small pox. you can&#39;t go around pretending that somehow they were able to vaccinate enough people against small pox to create permanent vaccine induced herd immunity, but somehow are not able to vaccine enough people against polio to eradicate polio. it doesn&#39;t add up</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My issue is not with the vaccine. It&#39;s with making it mandatory. The parents have the right to decide. And I personally know about bad decisions I opted for radiation therapy on an otherwise perfectly healthy joint, and now I have an artificial hip as a consequence. I&#39;ll never know if the cancer would have come back or not. So I guess there&#39;s that. But the point is I made the decision. It was nobody&#39;s but mine to make. People argue about being vaccinated to protect the rest of the population like you&#39;re being irresponsible for not vaccinating yourself. They&#39;re not even thinking about the fact that in order to spread a disease you have to catch it yourself first. So you&#39;re putting yourself first in line for any kind of spread of contagion. Again that&#39;s a personal choice whether to take the risk or not. </p>

Thank you for sharing your story and personal view on this. I agree with you wholeheartedly. Vaccines should be a choice. Especially if we cannot easily determine who&#39;s health can be detrimentally effected by vaccines on an individual basis. That&#39;s what scares me most. </p>

<p>I had serious health issues growing up of which doctors could not figure out. It was caused by a common infection but none of the 40 doctors I saw ever put it together despite it being pretty obvious. But as a result, my body did not ever respond to vaccines by making antibodies, and on top of that, each vaccine made me extremely sick as well as damaged my health. There is no solid protocol to determine which kids should not be given vaccines due to serious health issues and reactions. Mandating them would be a sick cruel punishment to many kids who should not be receiving vaccines and their parents, who would have to watch them get sicker as a result. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, those numbers are way off just taking into consideration the common infection and health issue I had, and that&#39;s not the only cause of negative results and health consequences with vaccines. </p>

<p>But I agree with you, it should be left up to parents and doctors to figure out together based on each child. Mandating it is a scary thing. We have no set protocol for kids who need exemptions, no set system for kids needing exemptions. Right now, it comes down to doctor&#39;s notes but it&#39;s up to the doctor&#39;s discretion. I have had 2 friends with young babies who both got dangerously high fevers within 6 hours of vaccination, both twice. One of them, their pediatrician said to continue vaccination regiment, but the ER doctors said very much the opposite. At the end of the day, parents need to advocate for their children because doctors are not infallible. You can go to 6 different doctors for an issue and end up with way different diagnosis. Currently, Medicine is just not as cut and dry as we like to think it is.  </p>

<p>If herd immunity is a myth, why is it <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/111/7/E716.short">still being shown to work in the context of vaccinations?</a> That&#39;s not some obscure specialty journal, either. That&#39;s PNAS. <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1473309914708412">Here&#39;s another study</a> indicating herd immunity facilitated by a vaccine. </p>

<p>In fact, if it was a myth, why would it be mentioned in <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=%22herd+immunity%22&amp;amp;btnG=&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;as_sdt=0%2C38&amp;amp;as_ylo=2013">9,600 peer-reviewed articles</a> since 2013? </p>

<p>Now, if you believe the entire scientific structure is working to pull the wool over our eyes, that&#39;s sort of beyond my bailiwick of convincing you otherwise. Why do you put your faith, though, in a screen grab of some essay typed in Microsoft Word? Or a screen grab of a Reddit argument?

<p>Different viruses have different characteristics. There&#39;s a reason that we have a different flu shot every year, a tetanus shot every ten, and a polio vaccine just once. One strain&#39;s aggressive mutation does not discredit the entire enterprise. </p>

<p>And, on the subject of &quot;False dilemma fallacy&quot;:</p>

<p>There&#39;s a future where everyone gets vaccinated, and there&#39;s a future where herd immunity is disrupted because not enough people get vaccinated. In those two divergent worlds, <em>one of them</em> has the return of horrendous diseases. </p>

<p>I know I&#39;m not going to convince you, and I know that r/conspiracy has inherent distrust in institutions that makes it a great place for anti-vax to gain support, but here we are.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey, you aren&#39;t wrong. Those are all good points. My context is as someone who has spent years in the scientific research publishing industry, so depending on perspective I can be seen as a biased shill or a person will rare insight into how it works at the highest level.</p>

<p>Fraud exists. The pressures on research labs of universities are extraordinary, since they&#39;re all competing for limited grants. Some interpret their findings as more significant than they actually are, either because of false hope or malicious intent. The vast majority don&#39;t, though. And almost everybody reviewing and editing these papers (especially at top journals) takes their job very seriously (review, after all, is unpaid and for the benefit of science as a whole). </p>

<p>Some people have heavy conflicts of interest (declared or otherwise, though if you don&#39;t declare it you risk your career and reputation). These can be in the context you were talking about (tobacco industry funding research and so on). This is in large part taken into consideration when collections of papers are reviewed and compared. Some drug companies that push vaccines publish research that is pro-vaccine. But then there are thousands of papers from people without conflicts of interest that show the effectiveness of vaccinations. And lord knows they&#39;re also looking for side effects.</p>

<p>Again, some people are shady. Some high-profile people have known cohorts that all do what they can to review each other&#39;s work positively and dance around conflicts of interest so they all keep getting that sweet grant money. And again, the vast majority don&#39;t. Most of them view it as partly a homework assignment, partly a means of staying sharp and keeping their peers honest. Some arguments happen, some disagreements over what&#39;s right and what&#39;s wrong and what&#39;s bunk science and so on. </p>

<p>Some people like to pretend that these flaws don&#39;t exist, that science is pure and flawless and to be held up as unquestionable. This hurts the cause, because it&#39;s inaccurate. What&#39;s true, though, is that the vast body of evidence from decades of research, grown incrementally and validated continuously, show that vaccines are worthwhile. I mean, look at the disappearance of major diseases after they&#39;ve been vaccinated.</p>

<p>We also understand how vaccines can fail, based on that huge collection of test cases and research studies and reviews of research studies and doctoral theses and Nobel-worthy breakthroughs. They fail when not enough people use the vaccine to reach the threshold needed to stifle the target disease. That&#39;s true regardless of the presence of flaws and abnormalities and frauds among a small number of the hundreds of thousands of research papers that get published every year.</p>

<p>The drop was pronounced in infants too young to be vaccinated (Fig. 1A), itself a clear indication of herd immunity.</p>

<p>this was an age-stratified stochastic compartmental model of pertussis dynamics, assuming no primary vaccine failure and lifelong immunity following vaccination and natural infection. </p>

<p>We assumed aP prevents disease, with variable effects on transmission.</p>

<p>more assumptions </p>

<p>Our results are unambiguous: a model with no vaccine effect on transmission cannot reproduce the observed epidemiological patterns after vaccination (Fig. 1B). In particular, the model predicts a decline in young-infant cases if—and only if—aP blocks transmission.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>If a vaccine is going to work, everyone in the population needs to get the vaccine.    </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not very effective on it&#39;s own then is it? First, let&#39;s address the fact that vaccines don&#39;t <em>prevent</em> anything. They only <em>reduce your chance</em> for contracting a specific disease <em>if</em> and <em>only if</em> each (not all - some are still very dangerous) vaccination is given one at a time, spread out over time. According to the Schedule they have, this does not happen. That&#39;s like me saying hey, your car payment is $500, but I will sell you a chance for your payment to be lowered to only be $250. If you win, your car payment will be $250. If you lose, I get to keep the $250 and you still have to pay the $500 payment. Assuming you are the car and the vaccine is the chance to lower your payment, the risk is worth it to most people because all they see is -$250. Me, I see the $750 because a) I plan for worse case scenario and b) I see the added cost when factoring in all the side effects and the fact that it&#39;s just a <em>chance</em> and not a guarantee. </p>

<p>The government is trying to take free choice by turning citizen on citizen. The U.S. Government is not trustworthy and the message can no longer come from them so what do they do? Well, first they appeal to those who share the idea that vaccinations should be mandatory. They sell it you to in the terms that little Tommy <em>might</em> get sick in the future so as a parent, you have this duty to &quot;protect&quot; your child from a potential (again not guaranteed) risk. So then you say hey, my child is the most important thing on the planet so in turn, let me tell little Johnny&#39;s parents that he needs to vaccinated. It isn&#39;t necessary, it&#39;s isn&#39;t wanted but because little precious Tommy might potentially be affected then little Johnny must take action! Making someone do something just because a chance exists that something bad might happen, is ridiculous. Tommy <em>might</em> fall of his skateboard so I guess he better not do that. Little Tommy <em>might</em> fall down and scrape his knee while playing outside so I guess he better not do that. Little Tommy <em>might</em> get the flu because he played tag with an unvaccinated friend (who shows no signs of having fucking polio or mmr or anything else they vaccinate for). Little Tommy might also get hit by a bus, who knows what&#39;s going to happen to little Tommy in his life? No one fucking knows.   </p>

<p>The underlying problem here is that humans are playing &#39;God&#39;. Changing our makeup, preventing things like natural selection, becoming people we aren&#39;t, engineering everything we come into contact with. This is a manufactured society. etc. Everything living, lives in cycles and no matter how &quot;advanced&quot; people think we are that we shouldn&#39;t have to live with <em>insert whatever the topic of the day is</em>, is an absolute tragedy. A vaccination doesn&#39;t solve shit, people are still eradicated off the face of the planet with or without it. With or without diseases. Whatever you or whomever thinks they are doing to prevent their end of time from being their time, are sadly mistaken. War ,shitty people, accidents, murder, and the elements all still exist. What&#39;s the real problem that seeds people into forcing others to do what they wish? Wanting the ability to control what others think and do simply because <em>you</em> perceive a risk.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s easy to think that vaccines aren&#39;t necessary when you live in a world that has already been changed by the vaccine revolution. Smallpox was eradicated worldwide in 1977 and in 1934 in the US. Polio infections have fallen more than 99% and was eradicated in the US in 1979. Measles was eradicated endemically in 2000. It&#39;s easy to forget how bad things were. </p>

<p>If you want to stop playing God, then rewild, live off of hunting and foraging, and forego any doctor visits. But for God&#39;s sake, stay away from the general population if you contract any diseases. Until you do, cut back on the postmodern nihilism bullshit. It doesn&#39;t solve anything. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I totally agree with you there. I think we forget how bad polio was because we haven&#39;t had to live through it. Same of course with small pox and the only existing smallpox virus is in a repository in Russia and Atlanta if I&#39;m not mistaken. </p>

<p>Then I think of the measles outbreak in Minnesota and the resurgence of it due to antivaxxers really getting to the Somali community there and they taking the word and not having children vaccinated. </p>

<p>Am I an antivaxxer NO. Am I a pro vaxxer? No. </p>

<p>I like to just stay informed and I make informed decisions based on my research. I had my newborns vaccinated. Did they get 8 vaccines in one visit? No way. I definitely split them up and I can sleep at night knowing that I did what I feel is the best to protect my children. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m really glad you know how to use Google. That&#39;s super awesome that you know how to regurgitate facts but the real question is can you think for yourself or do you just follow the herd?</p>

<p>Personally, I know how to formulate my own opinion based on research and dedication to the issues I am passionate about. The ultimate truth that people don&#39;t seem to grasp about vaccinations is that you have NO CONTROL over what I choose to do or choose not to do with my body and that pisses people off because they can&#39;t get what they <em>want</em>. If you want to manufacture your reality, why don&#39;t you separate yourself from others? That&#39;s the control you have. To remove yourself. Not dictate for others.   </p>

<p>Please tell me in which ways you would be open to someone violating your body for the &quot;betterment of society&quot;. Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;ll wait.   </p>

<p>NO MEANS NO is not limited to the rape of women. If I say no to something that I don&#39;t need or want, I have that right as does any fellow American. The simple difference between you and I, is that I believe you should make the best decisions for you and I should make the best decisions for me. You seem to feel that you make the best decisions for you AND you make the best decisions on my behalf.    </p>

<blockquote>
<p>stay away from the general population if you contract any diseases.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Truly an ignorant thing to say. This isn&#39;t the Middle Ages and this is no Lazar House.   </p>

<p>To address your point, staying away from the general public is my first priority regardless of disease. I have no desire to interact with other humans beyond a computer screen and barely even there. However, that&#39;s not the world I live in and people are unfortunately a necessity to deal with. As a matter of fact, I <em>do</em> prefer to live off the land, to hunt and gather my food, forego doctors appointments, and build that which I need. Why? Because everything I <em>need</em> was already put here for me and I know how to make it work for me. I am self sufficient and interested in only my capabilities and character.   </p>

<p>Humans in general are evil, ignorant, vile creatures who forget they are a species in the animal kingdom because of science. I don&#39;t believe in the current social construct and think this world is over regulated as is, freedoms are being taken away day by day. If you want to be the frog in tepid water, be my guess. That isn&#39;t me. If you have no problem modifying what nature does on its own, which by the way will lead to catastrophic effects for the human race, then why don&#39;t you just genetically modify little Tommy to be disease free at the time of conception? THAT you have control over.   </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Until you do, cut back on the postmodern nihilism bullshit. It doesn&#39;t solve anything.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, how about you focus on the things that you can control, i.e. yourself? Telling others what to do or how to act is a telltale sign they lack the control they desire in their own life. Fun isn&#39;t it. </p>

<p>My last point is that you seem to believe that you or your seeds are entitled to a disease free life. You are not, no matter what you went through trying to achieve that. No animal, plant, or living creature on the planet is. Even Earth itself isn&#39;t but you can keep trying to convince me that humans are somehow above all that. Sure sure. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think you understand how a vaccine actually works. It exposes us to a dead version of that virus meaning the virus is just an empty shell with no dna. When it attaches to a cell, it tries to insert its dna like it normally would in order to replicate,  but there is nothing there. Antibodies detect the foreign presence, ingest it, and tag the virus. Now other blood cells know the virus and know to destroy it. They just recruited a larger team to fight if you are ever exposed to the live virus (immunity). Your antibodies/blood cells will already be prepared to fight it before it has a chance to replicate.
In the case of the flu virus, because it reaches such a large population so quickly, replicating at insanely high numbers, more mutations happen at a faster rate. So that vaccine with the dead strain of the current flu virus, won&#39;t be effective against the mutated strain that might show up in a matter of weeks. You would be better off wearing a mask if there is an outbreak in your area.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If MSM would start reporting truth many more people would understand the crimes and deceit behind the Food &amp; Drug Administration and the Pharmaceutical companies and why many vaccines and medicines are nothing more then a scheme. 
There are many great Doctors and Journalists exposing it and they get no or little attention for their work and disrespected by the masses.</p>

<p>&quot;FDA documents obtained under the Freedom of Information Act, revealed that the FDA has been concealing from the medical community and the public serious research misconduct; including fraud, deception, avoidable risks for human subjects — even deaths — that occurred in clinical trials. The FDA documents were obtained by Charles Seife, a journalism professor at New York University, and author of several books about deception.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>casting pearls before swine, jumping over dollars to pick up pennies, stealing from peter to pay paul...all the usual allegories describe how many people think for the time being. The crux is that they take the philosophical discussion and drag it down into the mud to try discrediting it. They change the subject and assassinate characters because they cannot win the honest battle. Starving the truth so itvwithers, dies and falls away from their psyche is prioritized far above compromising their cognitive dissonance</p>

<p>two things you need to know about vaccines and autism:</p>

<p>1) Vaccines cause anaphylaxis</p>

<p>2) Rubella causes Autism  (this is very significant, as it debunks establishment position that the cause of autism is unknown, and that the MMR causing autism is biologically implausible)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mean, at the end of the day, if I don&#39;t want to get a vaccine why should I? It&#39;s not up to you to determine my body, I thought that was the hip new feminist argument, right? But apparently you can shove whatever you want in me. Oh, because someone has an immuno-disorder we should just do whatever you feel is just to prevent them harm? For the good of the people, right? </p>

<p>Viruses exist because of how we exist and treat our environment. We act in a way that facilitates their existence. If we lived normally our environment would be in harmony and so would all microscopic organisms. And yet, people continue to live massively in their fear and are now forcing others to abide by their fear: that we must vaccinate or we will all die. It&#39;s not even really about the safety of AID people, it&#39;s about themselves--the kids with diseases are really just an excuse. </p>
