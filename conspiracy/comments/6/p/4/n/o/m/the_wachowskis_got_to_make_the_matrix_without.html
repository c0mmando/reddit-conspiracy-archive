    <div class="md"><p>The idea of the prison for your mind brings back those Will Smith kids talking about living in a different reality in their interviews. I mean, we are only awake to things like 911 what about the other 99.999% of things that we assume we know but may be completely taught to us deliberately wrong. In this environment the handlers have nothing to fear because 99.999% of people don&#39;t know what is real, they live in falsely simulated world in their minds, hence the material world becomes only what their minds know derived from false information they were taught. In such a scenario the deceivers control what the people know and become the simulators.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wonder how much u/coolshifts and u/Paramorefanclub are getting paid to put out this fire. Heaven forbid somebody in r/conspiracy should actually think that things were something other than what they&#39;ve been spoon-fed by The Establishment. Oh no, let&#39;s not break out of that shell. Let stay tidy and neet right where we been put. Believing that gender is fluid and that movies get made by a simple process of impressing the producers. That&#39;ll be the day.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>IThe 90s were perhaps the best time in Hollywood history to sell a spec or get a development deal if you were new and green. But the Wachowskis hadn&#39;t sold just one, they signed a three picture development deal. They were backed by a proven exec and legendary producer. This is all in the wiki <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Matrix#Production">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Matrix#Production</a>
Bounspd was successful. It was an undeniably good action flick with strong characterization, enough for the right experienced people to put faith in the Wachowskis. A very common Hollywood story actually. There are plenty of prominent uber directors and producers with similar tales, eg James Cameron, George Lucas, Spielberg, Shane Black.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s unusual for directors without much history to get big budget projects approved, but it does happen sometimes if a producer is willing to put a little faith in up-and-coming talent. Just because they hadn&#39;t done a major production before doesn&#39;t mean they had zero experience in film. Wikipedia says they had writing credits on a film back in 1994, so they were obviously in the industry before they hit it big. </p>

<p>That said, the philosophies on display in The Matrix are nothing new. It&#39;s not like they pushed some controversial new idea or something, they basically just took a bunch of philosophy 101 concepts and put them into a scifi martial arts movie. If anything, the film&#39;s thesis encourages questioning authority and the sequels get into ideas about societal control with regards to technology/authority vs humanity. It&#39;s not as if they ultimately conclude that it&#39;s a good idea to cede control to authority or something, the film seems to suggest that the power of the individual can overcome systems of control to come out on top. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Try to watch the movie. If you can filter out the strangely bad ideas there&#39;s a meta layer. Like for the Matrix movies you can watch these movies just as mindless escapist entertainment or you open your eyes and see patterns and ideas in line with occult/gnostic/illuminati concepts.</p>

<p>Like the Wachowskis themselves are representing the unification of sexes. Nothing there is a coincidence. It&#39;s planned.</p>
