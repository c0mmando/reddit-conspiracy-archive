    <div class="md"><p>I have a lot of sympathy for trans folk, my step-daughter is basically trans, even though she doesn&#39;t make a fuss about it at all. She acts and dresses like a man in every way, and made her name masculine. I don&#39;t feel like she is crazy in any significant way either, beyond normal people craziness. But she is like the only person like her I have ever met where that is the case. I interact with many of them in another social thing I am involved in, and they are, to a one, fucking crazy as hell. </p>

<p>Basically, I don&#39;t totally agree, but I don&#39;t disagree either.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not being a dick but back in school we called girls like that Tom-boys. They just act naturally like a man does, the way their hands are put in pockets, clothes, sports, mechanics... But none of them became trans. </p>

<p>I&#39;m also from a small town way up north and the whole trans thing was never talked about until very recently, so most of use didn&#39;t even know trans was thing. The &quot;tom boys&quot; that I grew up with are now married to men, but one of them is a farmer and the other lives outta town now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lol, tom boys are a way different animal. My wife is a tom boy, she liked playing sports more than she liked playing with dolls when she was a kid. But she still looks hot in a dress and you would never mistake her for a man. Our daughter looks like a linebacker or truck driver. She started refusing to wear shit with bows on it when she was like 3yrs old. She wears shit to hide her boobs, and has a deeper voice than any woman. When I was younger, we called that butch. But that is considered trans by today&#39;s standards.</p>

<p>Make no mistake, these are done to let the doctors practice for when they get out of the military, no other reason. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You say that, but Trump&#39;s &quot;4d Chess&quot; is kind of just a myth, perpetuated by his followers. He just runs his mouth, and can&#39;t help it.</p>

<p>Maybe he thought it was a good distraction at first, but then he got hot under the collar for some reason, and less than an hour after, tweeted more shade about Sessions.</p>

<p>He&#39;s obviously just trying to get Sessions to resign, because outright firing him would look too bad.</p>

<p>Or healthcare or black site torture programs or suspensions of habeas corpus or travel bans, or government funding, or financial industry regulation, or gun regulations, or environmental regulations, or trade, or civil asset forfeiture, or the drug war, or religion in government, or military funding, or...</p>

<p>Or healthcare</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Obama ran with a healthcare mandate (this was right after the documentary Sicko came out) and shunned a single payer system (the actual left wing healthcare plan), ran on the public option (the center plan as it offers both public and private) and then fought against the public option behind the scenes. He then passed a right wing healthcare plan that was written by the Heritage Foundation and originally passed by his &quot;opponent&quot; Mitt Romney in Massachusetts.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>black site torture programs</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Obama never closed any of the black site torture sites...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>suspensions of habeas corpus</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Obama was the one who suspended Habeas Corpus.</p>

<p>Now, since Obamas policy on all the other issues you listed was exactly in step with Republicans I am going to assume you think Republicans are different than Democrats in those ways you mentioned.</p>

<p>I will give you that Trump did suspend TPP, which Democrats would not of. But the rest of the issues you listed they are both the same. You actually believe that the corporate Democrats who run the Democratic Party are any different than the neo-cons? That they have different tax policy for instance? You are kidding yourself.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>He did end the torture programs.  Trump advocated bringing them back.  Just about the only support that remains for torture programs remains in the Republican party.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Obama was the one who suspended Habeas Corpus.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>False.  Bush suspended habeas corpus for enemy combatants and that&#39;s a popular sentiment in the Republican party.  Not so in the Democrat party</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Now, since Obamas policy on all the other issues you listed was exactly in step with Republicans</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Obama Justice Department took steps to end civil asset forfeiture in 2015.  Obama spoke against it repeatedly.  Trump called for it&#39;s return.</p>

<p>Also the only reason the states that have legalized are protected from the GOP&#39;s fervor to crack down on them is because of an amendment that restricts federal funds from being used against those states.  Every time it comes up for a vote Democrats overwhelmingly vote for it and Republicans overwhelmingly vote against it.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>and [Obama] shunned a single payer system</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Obama called for a public option and continues to do so.  You have a strange definition for the word &quot;shunned&quot;.  I&#39;ve never seen him speak against single payer either. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Are you so thick headed that you don&#39;t realize that the DNC&#39;s sole purpose is to make sure true progressives and socialists never have any power within the Democratic Party? </p>

<p>That Obama is the leader of these corporate Democrats along with the Clintons? That when they are campaigning they will speak to progressive populism but once in power they will do the exact opposite? </p>

<p>Let&#39;s look at some of the great things this fraud did while in office:</p>

<ul>
<li>Placed George Bush&#39;s Secretary of Defense into his cabinet as the new Secretary of Defense to continue Bush&#39;s foreign policy down to the letter. Literally a corporate rebranding of Bush&#39;s policies. </li>
<li>Had the rest of his cabinet chosen by Citigroup.</li>
<li>Sat on the sidelines and did nothing while Flint was poisoned, North Dakota pipeline protesters were terrorized, Wisconsin unions were busted and Occupy Wall Street was forcibly removed by the FBI.</li>
<li>Suspends Habeas Corpus</li>
<li>Promised to get us out of Iraq and Afganistan but instead has widened the war in the Middle East and is now bombing 7 countries ( Afghanistan, Iraq, Pakistan, Somalia, Yemen, Libya and Syria.)</li>
<li>Supports the TPP</li>
<li>Worst civil rights record of any president in history. Responsible for PRISM, the NSA&#39;s homeland spying program.</li>
<li>Not closing US black sites such as Guantanamo. So called terrorists continue to be held there indefinitely (15 years and counting) without trail while being tortured.</li>
<li>Passed a right wing healthcare plan that was written by the Heritage Foundation and originally passed by his &quot;opponent&quot; Mitt Romney in Massachusetts.</li>
<li>Pretended the economy was fine by replacing high paying jobs that were outsourced with part-time jobs that do not pay a living wage.</li>
<li>That&#39;s just the tip of the iceberg.</li>
</ul>

<p>Also keep in mind that the Democrats had a filibuster proof majority when he was elected and Obama used that to ban imports on Canadian drugs, make it illegal for the government to negotiate drug prices and passed Romneycare.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Are you so thick that you can&#39;t acknowledge the differences I provided you with?  While I will agree that the Democrats are more center right than many progressives like myself would prefer, there are numerous preferable differences with Democrat policy.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Promised to get us out of Iraq and Afganistan but instead has widened the war in the Middle East and is now bombing 7 countries ( Afghanistan, Iraq, Pakistan, Somalia, Yemen, Libya and Syria.)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And I suppose reducing the troop presence in the middle east from 150,000 to 14,000 counts for nothing?   </p>

<blockquote>
<p>while being tortured.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Haven&#39;t seen any evidence of that happening since the practice was banned.  Even if so it&#39;s still preferable to an official policy promoting torture. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Passed a right wing healthcare plan that was written by the Heritage Foundation and originally passed by his &quot;opponent&quot; Mitt Romney in Massachusetts.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And again, campaigned and continuously pushed for a public option.  Why is this so hard to acknowledge? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Pretended the economy was fine by replacing high paying jobs that were outsourced with part-time jobs that do not pay a living wage.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Better than losing jobs by 100&#39;s of thousands a quarter under Republicans.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Sat on the sidelines and did nothing while Flint was poisoned</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Oh you mean the catastrophe that a Republican governor caused by cutting corners and hiring incompetent subordinates?  </p>
