       That's what I was thinking, but I didn't want to be the first one to say it. It's a bit annoying when everything gets called a distraction, but this one really does seem like it came out of nowhere. I hadn't heard any talk of this up until now, and it's the perfect topic to steal headlines.

       The whole thing was a weird social experiment, maybe to normalize it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyone could join then demand a sex change and the military had to oblige and pay for it. That put them on at least four years of nondeployable status and in that time their contract would end. It was basicly a way to give out free sex change operation/therapy.

       Yea there was a lot of social experiment agenda driven type stuff like that under Obama. Another smaller example is they wanted to change all gender related titles to neutral gender. Like 'rifleman' to 'rifleperson' and other nonsense. None of it would help with what they do but would instead push their agendas.

       Why not just refuse to pay for the surgery but still allow them to serve? The military doesn't cover other elective surgeries, do they?
      </p>
      <p>
       I didn't even realize they covered transgender surgeries, because I actually have a good friend who is transgender and serves in the Navy. Last I heard he had no plans to transition until after he was out of the Navy anyway. Is he going to lose his job now because of this?

       Not sure. I think in my personal opinion if you are already transitioned or whatever, you shouldn't be fired, but the military or Tricare shouldn't be paying for anything relating to being trans.
      </p>

       Something else most people aren't aware of, is that military also pays for breast implant surgery.

       Do you have a source for that bread implant thing? That sounds ridiculous to me. A quick search finds me a ton of articles that say it isn't covered for military spouses, but I'm not sure if that includes servicemembers or not.

       Oh wow, after some reading, it seems like I fell for a myth. When I served it was talked about every now and then as fact. So, I was wrong. I guess this is what I get when I assume things without confirming it.

       No problem. I thought that seemed a bit crazy, and I'm glad us taxpayers aren't paying for it. It should be that way for anything that doesn't have an immediate medical need or relates to injuries sustained while serving.

       It's not considered elective surgery once they have a diagnosis of gender dysphoria. Once they have a medical diagnosis, then they can suit the military and government for not providing the support they need to be who they truly are.

       I considered "necessary surgery" something like an appendectomy or open heart surgery. Of course the government should be responsible for paying for a necessary surgery like that. If the person is physically or mentally unable to continue serving without the surgery, then I would consider that a necessary surgery too. My friend is continuing to serve without the surgery, and actually just reenlisted last year I believe. So I would say this isn't a necessary surgery for him. Does that really make me a bad friend?

       So that statement is already misleading based on the link above, but also...isn't one of the big reasons people join the military is to get those kind of benefits?  Should we tell them what other kinds of medical treatment they can get while serving?  This is still their job

       Then they should be discharged, honorably, for a pre-existing condition. Many people who haven't served eight years (which is when every disability becomes service-connected in the eyes of the military) are routinely discharged for issues that existed prior to service (think heart defects or epilepsy).
      </p>
      <p>
       You can't have shit both ways with transgenderism. It's either a medical disability or it's an innate understanding that existed prior to service. Since most transpeople believe they are born thy way they are, the military should not be obligated to cover their medical expenses. I think transpeople should be given the option to serve with that understanding, but they are not entitled to medical rights that no other person would have in the military.

       Announcing it today might be a distraction but this shift started in January as soon as Mattis became Secretary of Defense. Under Obama things like this and other politically correct issues were a priority and caused more problems then they solved. Mattis put a stop to a lot of it as soon as he could.

       They are citizens and they should have a right to serve. Serving in the armed forces is historically a cornerstone of seeking basic human dignity for oppressed groups. When you deny them their right to serve, you deny them the right of ever being able to say they put their life on the line for this country. It's just another way of keeping them second-class citizens.

       Diabetics don't get to serve in the military. Are they second class citizens? Epileptics don't get to serve in the military, are they second class citizens? There is a medical reality that has to be considered. The trans people I know, freak the fuck out when they run out of hormones and can't get them re-upped. Guess what, in a war zone, that's a fucking liability to their brothers and sisters fighting with them.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think transpeople should be allowed to serve as long as they agree to forego the medical aspects of transitioning. Trans people have no right to have the military cover their medical treatments. If one day they make a magic pill that rewrites all your DNA on the cellular level with the maintenance requirements, then sure, trans people should be allowed to transition while serving, otherwise nope.

       , and yet the military manages to keep them supplied, but apparently transporting hormone medication breaks the camel's back? The military also supplies cigarettes, alcohol, coffee, and other completely unnecessary drugs to soldiers, in addition to medications for permitted conditions. I don't see consistency here.

       There's no way that a trans person post sex reassignment surgery could do any military job post surgery. This is for MtF -- they have to spend upwards of 1-2 hours 3 times a day dilating their new genitals. You can't be active duty and have time to do that. And considering that it is akin to an open wound, it would be very easy for post-op transwomen to develop life threatening infections from the nastiness of the military life. I know that some Marines in basic used to get 3 squares of TP a day to wipe their asses, because they want the recruits to understand that when they are in theater, they aren't going to have the creature comforts of home, like all the TP they need to wipe their asses.

       FFS, imagine we have to fight the Russians and they know we have transgendered people in the military. The simple morale boost they will experience is not worth the cost of allowing ~2500 people with gender issues to be in the military.

       And there it is, what's at the heart of all of this opposition. People don't like trans people, think they're icky, or evil, or perverted, so they try to come up with all kinds of secondary reasons to justify their stupid, ignorant, childish bigotry.

       If you have a heart defect that is discovered while serving, it isn't covered by the military or the VA. The military covers things that are service connected. Transgenderism is not service connected. The military and the VA shouldn't be on the hook to provide hormones, etc for a "condition" that existed prior to service.

        /r/science

       AMA addressed the costs of surgeries and hormone treatments and pretty much said it was all super cheap. They were talking about the hormones being like $30/month tops and the surgeries being similar in cost to a knee surgery. If this is correct, then it seems pretty irrelevantly cheap to make a fuss over.

       Have you ever dealt with someone who isn't on their hormones? It makes people crazy. Diabetics don't get to serve, epileptics don't get to serve. It's not a question of cost as much as what will happen in a situation when that soldier, etc. can't get their hormones. It makes people unpredictable and in some cases, unmanageable.

       Oh man, this is not gonna go over well. I know one side will scream "discrimination" while the other will scream "mental illness" but you gotta understand this from a military standpoint.
      </p>
      <p>
       The military wants its soldiers in top condition, both mentally and physically.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you need extra medical treatment from the get go, whether it's hormone treatment, psychological treatment etc. you're a liability, especially if the military has to pay for all that. 
And in a military environment you never know if you have access to these things when you need them.
      </p>
      <p>
       So it makes sense to me. I'm sure they dismiss plenty of people because of medical reasons. And that's basically what transgenderism is - a medical condition.

       Hmm. From what I understand, transgendered people are born one gender but associate with the other...How the hell are they going to enforce this? Unless the potential candidate is honest to a fault and this is a question asked how would they ever know? You can't look at someone and see that they associate with the opposite gender.

       I don't think that is a problem. It's when they insist that the military cover and support their transition that is problematic. This is not a service connected disability, and people are routinely discharged, honorably, for pre-existing medical conditions (epilepsy, heart conditions, diabetes, etc etc etc) that impinge on their duties as servicepeople.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have no problem with transpeople serving, but they should not be entitled to medical treatment, otherwise they can be discharged like others having medical conditions that would undermine their service.

       The military does not exactly "enforce" the use of the correct gender pronouns, but if one is corrected after using the incorrect pronoun and continues to use that incorrect pronoun deliberately, then they will face disciplinary action.

       They are citizens and they should have a right to serve. Serving in the armed forces is historically a cornerstone of seeking basic human dignity for oppressed groups. When you deny them their right to serve, you deny them the right of ever being able to say they put their life on the line for this country. It's just another way of keeping them second-class citizens.
