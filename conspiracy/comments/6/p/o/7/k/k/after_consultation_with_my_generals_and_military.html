    <div class="md"><p>Yea there was a lot of social experiment agenda driven type stuff like that under Obama. Another smaller example is they wanted to change all gender related titles to neutral gender. Like &#39;rifleman&#39; to &#39;rifleperson&#39; and other nonsense.

    <div class="md"><p>I considered &quot;necessary surgery&quot; something like an appendectomy or open heart surgery. Of course the government should be responsible for paying for a necessary surgery like that. If the person is physically or mentally unable to continue serving without the surgery, then I would consider that a necessary surgery too. My friend is continuing to serve without the surgery, and actually just reenlisted last year I believe. So I would say this isn&#39;t a necessary surgery for him.

<p>So that statement is already misleading based on the link above, but also...isn&#39;t one of the big reasons people join the military is to get those kind of benefits?  Should we tell them what other kinds of medical treatment they can get while serving?  This is still their job</p>

<p>Then they should be discharged, honorably, for a pre-existing condition. Many people who haven&#39;t served eight years (which is when every disability becomes service-connected in the eyes of the military) are routinely discharged for issues that existed prior to service (think heart defects or epilepsy). </p>

<p>You can&#39;t have shit both ways with transgenderism. It&#39;s either a medical disability or it&#39;s an innate understanding that existed prior to service. Since most transpeople believe they are born thy way they are, the military should not be obligated to cover their medical expenses. I think transpeople should be given the option to serve with that understanding, but they are not entitled to medical rights that no other person would have in the military. </p>

<p>That discomfort is their hangups, their problems, not the fault of trans people simply for existing.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>They are citizens and they should have a right to serve. Serving in the armed forces is historically a cornerstone of seeking basic human dignity for oppressed groups. When you deny them their right to serve, you deny them the right of ever being able to say they put their life on the line for this country. It&#39;s just another way of keeping them second-class citizens.</p>

<p>No, because both of those conditions clearly interfere with their ability to perform their duties. Being transgender does not.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>People freak the fuck out if they run out of <em>food</em>, and yet the military manages to keep them supplied, but apparently transporting hormone medication breaks the camel&#39;s back? The military also supplies cigarettes, alcohol, coffee, and other completely unnecessary drugs to soldiers, in addition to medications for permitted conditions. I don&#39;t see consistency here.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s no way that a trans person post sex reassignment surgery could do any military job post surgery. This is for MtF -- they have to spend upwards of 1-2 hours 3 times a day dilating their new genitals. You can&#39;t be active duty and have time to do that. And considering that it is akin to an open wound, it would be very easy for post-op transwomen to develop life threatening infections from the nastiness of the military life. I know that some Marines in basic used to get 3 squares of TP a day to wipe their asses, because they want the recruits to understand that when they are in theater, they aren&#39;t going to have the creature comforts of home, like all the TP they need to wipe their asses.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh man, this is not gonna go over well. I know one side will scream &quot;discrimination&quot; while the other will scream &quot;mental illness&quot; but you gotta understand this from a military standpoint.</p>

<p>The military wants its soldiers in top condition, both mentally and physically.</p>

<p>If you need extra medical treatment from the get go, whether it&#39;s hormone treatment, psychological treatment etc. you&#39;re a liability, especially if the military has to pay for all that. 
And in a military environment you never know if you have access to these things when you need them.</p>

<p>So it makes sense to me. I&#39;m sure they dismiss plenty of people because of medical reasons. And that&#39;s basically what transgenderism is - a medical condition. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think that is a problem. It&#39;s when they insist that the military cover and support their transition that is problematic. This is not a service connected disability, and people are routinely discharged, honorably, for pre-existing medical conditions (epilepsy, heart conditions, diabetes, etc etc etc) that impinge on their duties as servicepeople.</p>

<p>I have no problem with transpeople serving, but they should not be entitled to medical treatment, otherwise they can be discharged like others having medical conditions that would undermine their service.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t want a military that is fighting internally due to discomfort</p>

<p>That discomfort is their hangups, their problems, not the fault of trans people simply for existing.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So let the trans people live and let live, but they don&#39;t need to do it in the military disrupting it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They are citizens and they should have a right to serve. Serving in the armed forces is historically a cornerstone of seeking basic human dignity for oppressed groups. When you deny them their right to serve, you deny them the right of ever being able to say they put their life on the line for this country. It&#39;s just another way of keeping them second-class citizens.</p>
