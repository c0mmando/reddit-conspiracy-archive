<p>Basically I connected Jade Helm to immigration.  </p>

<p>Remember when Obama was busing in all the illegals? </p>

<p>Interesting thing that where I live the Walmart they shut down (remember the 6 or so walmarts they shut down around Jade Helm) would be prime real-estate for illegals to drop boots in America. The Walmart is right in the middle of little Mexico. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Im not sure if you meant they drop them off as in walmarts involved or as in &quot;heres america good luck&quot; but i would doubt either.</p>

<p>I wouldnt be surprised to learn a company tue size of walmart was involved in &quot;off the books&quot; activities, or possibly a group of employees was using their positions to move product using walmarts logistic machine, but i would be surprised to learn they were using retail stores.</p>

<p>There are employees in those stores 24hrs. Without having the entire staff on the job there is too much risk.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I haven&#39;t seen an article that even attempts to answer a very basic question that would shed a lot more light on this: ethnicitiy and ages of people in the truck. </p>

<p>San Antonio+some hispanic families and old dudes= illegal immigrant smuggling</p>

<p>A bunch of girls 25 or under= human sex trafficking</p>

<p>A bunch of kids= well, we know what that means and this would be the worst case scenario so, perhaps, that&#39;s why we&#39;re not getting any details. </p>
