        TL;DR - Every person has a STRAWMAN or Treasury Direct Account worth millions used as collateral by the government. You are property. You can access this account and use it to pay debts and bills, but you could also be arrested for doing so. Heather Ann Tucci-Jarraf is a U.S. attorney and financial expert spear-heading a movement of getting these funds in the hands of the rightful owner, YOU! She has been arrested by the FBI.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Let me preface this by saying, this is a deep, deep, dangerous rabbit hole.
      </p>
      <p>
       If it's true that we all have a large sum of money attached to us through our birth certificate which doubles as a stock certificate used as collateral by the government, then this information is very valuable.
      </p>
      <p>
       I will try to be brief.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't even fully understand how this all works, but supposedly there is a movement of sorts spear-headed by Heather Tucci of people accessing their accounts and using them to pay off debts and bills.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can't withdraw funds from the account, but you can use it to pay debt, bills, and to buy CDs (Certificate of Deposit).

       This account created at your birth is called a TDA or Treasury Direct Account. It is accessible through the Federal Reserve bank. You can use it like a bank account by using the routing number for your district and your social security number. I'm not going into full detail because:

       The odd thing is you can gain official ownership of your STRAWMAN by filling out a UCC-1 form...yes, an official government form for an account in YOUR name that isn't supposed to exist.

        Who Is Heather Tucci?

       Heather is a former attorney with a few other credentials from @thelightreports on Steemit -

      <p>
       That's pretty much all I know about her. That, and that she was arrested by 3 FBI agents in the Terrorism division on the July 25, 2017, I think it was.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are videos all over YouTube following her case. This post is too long already.

        Conclusion
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't really know what to make of all of this. If there really is an account for each of us that is rightfully ours and will make us financially free, I absolutely think that needs to happen ASAP.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, as with everything, what are the ramifications of that?
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, if this isn't true then why have people been able to access these accounts and pay bills with their SSN? Are they all lying? What do the ones lying about this stand to gain? Is it just another scam? -

       If it is true, the arrests taking place would seem to be to silence popular proponents of this movement.

       I've never really gotten a good explanation as to 1) why these accounts are set up, or 2) why they are made accessible to the public if they have the "know how"? It just doesn't make sense to me that these would exist. I'm not calling anyone a liar, just saying what's the purpose for their existence?

       I'm certainly no expert, but my understanding is that supposedly:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         The accounts are set up as collateral making each person property of their respective government since government are essentially corporations. Your birth certificate has a number on it and doubles as a stock certificate making you an asset.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         We were never supposed to find out about the accounts.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       Of course, it's not like they hid them that well. It doesn't seem to me that anyone with some good financial training wouldn't learn about UCC and find out about these accounts...IF they exist.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've heard all kinds of theories from the government planning to give access to these accounts if you take a chip to them using it to keep you in financial slavery. If it's collateral, can't they use it to secure loans or to pay off loans? What would happen to the people if you used their "stock certificate" to pay off a loan say to China? Would that person then be the property of China?
      </p>
      <p>
       Whatever the case, it wasn't set up as good will and that would be why they have such a fit over people finding out about it and accessing these accounts.
      </p>
      <p>
       It could be a huge scam and be a loophole in the financial system people are exploiting leading to fraud and a heap of trouble. I ain't trying it!

         No person can be property in the United States, following the 13th Amendment. Nor is your birth certificate a "stock certificate," because "stock" refers to equity in a corporation. Human beings are not corporations. Nor is there a corporation set up in your name at birth; doing so would be pointless because it wouldn't benefit the government or the individual in any way.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         If there were such accounts, and we "were never supposed to find out" about them, they wouldn't print the account numbers on social security cards, would they?
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       There are all sorts of logical problems with these theories. If the accounts are collateral, then why would they tie each account to an individual? They could just hold the cash centrally much more easily. Breaking it up into 300 million individual accounts doesn't help collateralize anything. (Nor does the government need to collateralize its debts, but whatever.)
      </p>
      <p>
       They're having "such a fit" over people pulling this scheme for the same reason they have a fit over people who kite checks or counterfeit money or pickpocket at the county fair--its attempted theft.

       Again, I find your comment very valuable to this discussion. I have to admit my ignorance in understanding how corporations work and any technical knowledge of collateral.

       Hypothetically, they would create the accounts on an individual level because they could trade in numbers rather than one asset as a whole. It's the same principle for diversifying income streams or spreading out assets among offshore accounts.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the notion that the we cannot be property, that's well and good, but what does "human capital" refer to in this executive order? -

      <p>
       That's not the rationale for diversifying income streams or other assets. And if the government wanted 300 million separate accounts, it can create 300 million separate accounts. There's no reason to tie each account to a separate citizen.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Human capital" does not mean property. It refers to the value of a person's or a group of people's skills and talents. You can say, "We've got very valuable human capital in this company," or even, "We own a great store of human capital in this country," but it's a figure of speech. You can't own human capital the same way you own a hammer or a truck (other kinds of capital), because human beings can't be property. 13th Amendment again.

       Yeah, the more I think about it, the more ludicrous it becomes.
      </p>
      <p>
       I read somewhere that these accounts are supposed to hold $5 billion minimum per person. Is there even a type of account that could be created that would yield that kind of interest off of a supposed $1 million initial investment. How are they defining "person". A 1-year-old would already have $5 billion? Ridiculous!(A moot point all around at this juncture.)
      </p>
      <p>
       If any such account existed in our name, we'd be taxed for it in some way like we are for everything else. LOL
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, the fact that all of the transaction portion of these "payments" people are making with these "accounts" are on the payee end through their website...not the Federal Reserve is a red flag.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like you said earlier, the payment goes through initially because you are providing seemingly legit bank info. It's a matter of convenience to law-abiding consumers.

       Dude don't fall for that guy. He makes it his mission to dissuade people from this for whatever reason a person would make that their mission. I have paid off many bills, and many have the balances revert, but not a single one has been reversed. At that point, you just take a pic of your receipt, then call and say "hey this money still shows on my acct. Why isn't is reflecting on the balance?".

       It's your social security card, not your birth certificate, right? I know several people that have paid their credit cards off with their ssn, along with the numbers on the back. Payment went through, but were shortly reversed. It is a real bank routing number, apparently, you just aren't allowed to have your money.

       That's not what a routing number is. You're thinking of an account number. And it's possible that your social security card's number could correspond with a real account number (someone else's number, obvs), but that's not why the payments seem to work temporarily. It's because the back-end payment system is wonky and often takes customers at their word when they submit "payment." It takes a few days to confirm the "payment" is bogus.

       So, Heather Tucci's client that is being held by the feds on a trumped up warrant from the made-up town of Jasper CO, along with two other warrants that were manufactured
       <em>
        after
       </em>
       his arrest, just happened to access an account worth 27 million dollars? And, why arrest Tucci for merely doing her job and representing her client? She didn't know the client before his arrest, as far as I know.

       Neither one of us knows what's going on in those cases--there's no real detailed information available yet. If you disagree, please do share some good evidence that the town doesn't exist, that the warrants were manufactured after the arrest, that he actually accessed millions of dollars, etc. Or what the charge on Tucci's warrant was.
      </p>
      <p>
       At any rate, "people got arrested for doing this" is very, very poor evidence that it works.

       Not reversed, never reversed. The balance of the acct
       <em>
        reverts
       </em>
       , even though the money is still there. Try it, then call the company that you paid through, and ask them to reapply the money to your balance. If they refuse, just keep paying them, then once you get a balance built up, call and close your account; ask for the money on your acct to be credited back to you.

       while this post is thorough and well-written, this one sentence is the most important.
      </p>
      <p>
       "I'm not going into full detail because:
I've never done it"
      </p>
      <p>
       Because if you had done you'd realize it really it just a scam, and counts as fraud because you're providing fake bank details to pay a bill. The only reason it "seems" to work is because it takes several days for a company to withdraw money from an account, so they don't realize right away that you've given them fake details and so the bill appears to be paid until they have to reverse the payment.
      </p>
      <p>
       giving fake bank details IS fraud, so the federal reserve isn't wrong to say that.

       Same here. The link in the conclusion above is from a forum that I'm also not familiar with claiming she no longer has a license to practice law and that she may be a drinker. &lt;-- Again, nothing concrete. I know absolutely nothing about her.

       Free money is nice, but troublesome on scale.
      </p>
      <p>
       Imagine if everybody had free money.  It would become meaningless.
      </p>
      <p>
       Getting stuff for free doesn't tend to increase one's underlying capacity if it's not used for that direct purpose.   It can change your circumstances, but it can't change your capacity.  Capacity is inherently internal.  One's social circumstances has a correlation to one's capacity.
      </p>
      <p>
       On scale, everyone getting free money will just fuck shit up.  It devalues currency.  Currency devaluation leads to other currencies, suffering from the same design issue - namely faith in the currency itself (whether by military force, collective agreement, or proven scarcity, for example).
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd argue we shouldn't be looking for free money or even taking it if it's offered.  We should rather build our own capacity and our networks of capacity, if we want real wealth.  Devaluing the USD would have catastrophic domestic effects.

       My thoughts exactly. This sounds nice, but what are the repercussions?

       The technical legal term for this is "wire fraud." Lots of other crimes apply too, but I think that's the simplest fit. It's fraud because conspiracy theory here isn't true.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         The government doesn't set up accounts in your name at birth. There isn't any reason for it to do so. Nor are there account records or other documents showing such accounts in any of these cases.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         If the government did set up such accounts, you wouldn't have access to the money. If the government funded the account, it would be the government's money, not yours. (Moot point, since there is no account.)
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         If the government did set up such account and you did have the right to the money but they didn't want you to use it, they wouldn't give you the account number--there's no legal obligation for them to do so, after all. (Moot point, since there is no account.)
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         If there was such an account, a UCC filing statement would have nothing to do with it. The UCC doesn't give you access to bank accounts.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       A while back, u/grarglejober claimed he'd done this and paid off his T-Mobile bill. I got a private message from an account claiming to be an alt of his, and he admitted that most of the "payments" he'd submitted this way had failed. He claimed the phone payment was still valid, but it had only been a week.
      </p>
      <p>
       The reason this scam is spreading faster than most pseudolegal frauds is that it
       <em>
        appears
       </em>
       to work for a week or so in some cases. Online payment tools are designed to make your payment as fast and convenient as possible, so as soon as you offer payment the website will "accept" it and tell you you're paid up. But the actual processing on the payee side, drawing funds from the source you submit, can take a week or more. (Someone with ACH experience told me on r/conspiracy that it can be 10 days.)
      </p>
      <p>
       The gap in between "I submitted my Fed Reserve account and T-Mobile credited my account!" and "Wait, now my balance is back to negative, they rejected the payment!" is plenty of time for people to go online and preach about this magical debt relief tool, as plenty of people are doing on YouTube. But no one's actually seeing long-term success with this, because the accounts don't exist.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now we're seeing actual arrests, which is what happens when people commit fraud. Using this to pay your phone bill probably won't get you arrested. Using it to pay fifty bills might, and using it to buy an RV or pay down a car loan probably will. Just the same as if you were kiting checks.
      </p>
      <p>
       TL;DR: The scheme described above is fraudulent and a crime. It will not and cannot work, because the story about secret accounts in your name is not true.

       This makes a ton of sense.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's easy for a well-read conspiracy theorist to believe anything secretive and nefarious from the government because some heinous acts perpetrated by the government have been proven true through declassified documents, leaks, and whistleblowers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regardless if an account exists or not, it's like you said, it's not your money.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is not a new theory. I've heard for years that the government is a corporation, and we are among its assets.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, I've never heard until in the last year of people actually attempting to access accounts and use them.
      </p>
      <p>
       The key here is that I haven't seen any proof whatsoever of these debts being paid, and as you said, I'm definitely not hearing of anyone having long-term success. I have seen a lot of people talking about how to deal with rejected or reversed payments.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've also seen notices posted by the Federal Reserve that this is fraud.
      </p>
      <p>
       I expect to see these loopholes closed. I'm just going to sit back and see what happens.

       If by "loophole" you mean the lag between submitting a payment and the payee determining that it's fraudulent, I don't think that will be closed anytime soon.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only way to eliminate the lag would be to not accept payments until the money is actually received, which would mean when you pay your phone or credit card bill online you wouldn't get an immediate "paid" notification. That would piss off legitimate users too much.
      </p>
      <p>
       There aren't enough scammers trying this to make it worth big companies' time to make significant changes to their back-end payment systems, as far as I can tell. Small-time scammers will eventually pay up or get cut off, and big-time scammers will get busted. The phone company expects and tolerates a certain amount of payment scheming and similar bullshit, because it's easier than trying to create a 100% foolproof system. (The rest of us pay for it in marginally higher rates.)

       No, they aren't. There are &gt;300 million social security numbers in the US. No bank has &gt;300 million routing numbers. It might have that many accounts, but routing numbers are a different thing. More like a phone number than an account number.

       Ngl I was in a pickle a lot of stress and family issues I tried it and it worked it's been roughly 3 1/2 weeks it cleared I called the debt agency and said they've received payment. If you look on the FDR website and says this is a scam but not illegal and all payments should be reserved due to fdr only working with banks.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now I'm just waiting. I've yet to get a reversal, the statement by the fdr said it wasn't illegal only a scam and the only issue you'll face is payments from the company you tried to pay your bill for. Mainly late fees.
      </p>
      <p>
       I only didn't one bill considering I thought about my actions the moment I sent the payment. Idk so I'm just waiting I can proof of both the fdr/debit statement so idk.

       Scams are illegal. The Fed Reserve has not stated that these schemes are legal.

       I'm sorry about your stress and family issues. I hope they're resolved, because the debt is going to come back on you, probably with late fees now. If you aren't already putting aside money to make a valid payment, that's what I'd be doing in your shoes.

       Nothing before the Constitution is controlling law in the United States (1787, I think). The Cestui Que Vie Act isn't even active law in the UK as far as I know, and under no circumstances would it make a difference in the United States. Different countries, different laws.

      <p>
       Minnesota Rule 220, whatever it is, would only affect you if you were in Minnesota. State rules don't have any power outside their state.
      </p>
      <p>
       Admiralty law would only affect you if you were a boat.
      </p>
      <p>
       Corpus Juris Civilis is apparently Roman law? Also not applicable.

       Notice that he has nothing to say about this. The guy who commented on you makes it his mission to go around and spread fear about this stuff. Good on you for taking the time to do the thing yourself. I have, too, with varying degrees of success, but there
       <em>

       </em>
       been success, which renders everything this guy says moot.

       It won't. If it did, it would just mean that you slipped between the cracks. "Not getting caught committing fraud" is not the same thing as "not committing fraud."

       This scam is basically just writing someone else's name on a check and hoping no one will notice. They will. And it's illegal.

       Thought so. Seriously, why? For being an attorney for someone that was able to get his ssn money? Hopefully the arrest is just for her protection. I last heard she was working closely with some folks inside the WH. Time will tell..

       Guy on YouTube started pushing it recently ("Harvey Dent"), and it got faddish. I think it's spreading more quickly than it has in the past because everyone's doing it online, and assuming the courtesy "paid" notice they get from the phone or cable company means the scam worked. Then they go online and talk about it, spreading the seeds for other scammers.
      </p>
      <p>
       But when the payment gets reversed, they don't share that as quickly, or they don't admit it at all, or worst of all they lie about it because they're embarrassed about getting taken in.
      </p>
      <p>
       The result is lots of comments and YouTube videos saying "it works!," and many fewer admitting, "oh hell, it got reversed." People see more of the former, and want to believe it so they take it too seriously.

       Yeah, YouTube is where I first heard about all this. The information being shared there is convoluted. You have staunch wannabe YouTubers adamant that these accounts exist and using them is working for them...specifically sometime in the last month.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is contrasted by NUMEROUS confused comments talking about reversals, etc. While some of the video makers have addressed these "reversals", usually their response is that it's a corrupt Federal Reserve just being cantankerous and that you must be persistent.
      </p>

       The truth here is that people are being arrested. Unless you want to be among them, don't attempt this.

       On the other hand, there are people out there claiming they've bought cars and RVs this way. And yeah, they're probably going to jail over it.

       From what I gather, a guy named Randall Beane came up with the idea of filing a notarized Factualized Trust form on the TDA and then using that "account" to purchase bonds at his (UAA) bank. He then used the bonds to secure a loan to purchase a $500,000.00 motor home from an RV dealer. 
Mister Beane was arrested (for Bank Fraud?), just as you would be if you used checks written on an account with no money in it to buy the bonds. But the case is complicated, not because of the TDA, but because the RV dealer actually received payment. The funding for the motor home didn't come from the TDA, it came from the finance company. The finance company hasn't been defrauded unless they can show proof that Randall Beane lied to them and had no intention of repaying the loan. 
The bonds which secure the loan were bought through the TDA. This is complicated by the factualized trust filing. 
But do not think that, because Randall Beane made this a complex series of transactions, it's not fraud. It is. 
And a quick search of "Randall Keith Beane" shows that he is no stranger to the criminal justice system. 
One thing that I saw as a common theme in comments on videos about this subject is; people who are interested in this seem willing to believe that just being born gives them value. Not just value to their families, but millions of dollars of monetary value, and all of these people who feel that the government is withholding their billions of dollars of accumulated wealth have gotten themselves into unmanageable debt. They can't pay their bills and want to believe a pot of gold at the end of a rainbow.

       I don't think anything I wrote should scare anyone. If people think there's some magical way to get rich by accessing a secret account that, for some reason no one can explain, has billions of dollars for the taking, they should go get it.

       This is not about getting rich quick or finding an easy out. It's about encouraging others to do some
Research, to look into what's going out there every single day. Letting people find out their true potentials, not just slaving away for some corp. You keep doing your thing buddy.

       But when I did some research as you claim to be in favor of I found what I found and I shared it. But because it doesn't fit with your dream you attack me.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for people finding their "true potentials", this has nothing to do with anyone's potential. It has to with free money. Like winning a lottery without buying a ticket. The Publisher's Clearinghouse Sweepstakes. If you're "slaving away for some corp" while dreaming of a future where your life is made worth living by some effortless windfall of wealth maybe you've reached your "true potential" and just don't know it yet.
      </p>
      <p>
       But maybe I'm wrong. Perhaps I'm completely mistaken. It's possible, I've been wrong before. I've been married twice and wrong both times. I once thought Compuserv would be a major player in the internet services business. I made Netscape my primary browser. So, I'm no stranger to being wrong, but my guess is your mistakes have taken a much larger toll on your life than mine. So the question remains; How are you enjoying your new BILLIONAIRE lifestyle? I'm guessing your not.

       IT'S NOT A SCAM!
I have been researching the whole thing. It's flat out Federal and Political Fraud. You look deep into this stuff, and you're going to find the proof- it's not a Scam.
The problem is that Tucci is in a court case that can't incarcerate her yet they will do it anyway because they don't want you to find out that THEY OWN YOU.
No one has profited from doing this- Harvey Dent on YouTube.com lost his house over buying 2 Million Dollars in CDs- it's real! The Federal Bank reversed the charges. I confirmed my account existed at Chase Bank by tranferring $0.00 from the routing number to my bank account, and they put in a few cents so you can go back and tell them how much they put in the account- which happens to just be THE FEDERAL RESERVE BANK IN CHICAGO! Harvey Dent started a website intellectualfreedommovement.com 
If you want to dig up some fucking dirt on these CROOKS who have marked you like a bunch of fucking COWS- you gotta get on this website and start TALKING.

       I'm of the camp that if something seems too good to be true it probably is. I do think that's true in this case but have to say I was pretty shocked when I plugged my father's social into a gmei lookup utility, and I see number of what appears to be current financial transactions. He's been passed away for more than 20 years, so why would there be financial trading activity unless it's a huge coincidence that his social matches another Legal Entity Identifier.

       It is getting funnier. The "Family" are cyber stalking the FBI agent involved in this case and have come up with the shocking revelation that he is DEAD!

       It also lists Heather Ann Tucci-Jarraf as DEAD!

       In reality all the site returns is "View Records' and a subscription deal to see them. Of course, the idea that the web site they are searching is trying to dupe them into handing over money to see non-existent records hasn't occurred to them!

       I'm certainly no expert, but my understanding is that supposedly:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         The accounts are set up as collateral making each person property of their respective government since government are essentially corporations. Your birth certificate has a number on it and doubles as a stock certificate making you an asset.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         We were never supposed to find out about the accounts.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       Of course, it's not like they hid them that well. It doesn't seem to me that anyone with some good financial training wouldn't learn about UCC and find out about these accounts...IF they exist.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've heard all kinds of theories from the government planning to give access to these accounts if you take a chip to them using it to keep you in financial slavery. If it's collateral, can't they use it to secure loans or to pay off loans? What would happen to the people if you used their "stock certificate" to pay off a loan say to China? Would that person then be the property of China?
      </p>
      <p>
       Whatever the case, it wasn't set up as good will and that would be why they have such a fit over people finding out about it and accessing these accounts.
      </p>
      <p>
       It could be a huge scam and be a loophole in the financial system people are exploiting leading to fraud and a heap of trouble. I ain't trying it!

       "The ultimate ownership of all property is in the State: individual so-called 'ownership" is only by virtue of Government, i.e. law amounting to mere user; and use must be in accordance with law and subordinate to the necessities of the State. Senate Document No. 43 73rd Congress 1st Session. (Brown v. Welch supra) You own no Property because you are a slave. Really you are worse off than a slave because you are also a debtor."
