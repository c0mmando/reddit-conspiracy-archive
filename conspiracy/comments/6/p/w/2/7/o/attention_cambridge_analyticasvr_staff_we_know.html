       All those are linked to T_D and none of it links to CA...

       For all I know it was a false flag infiltration. So, we have the overt statement from Shareblue of online manipulation. What, apart from your imagination suggests CA is using shills here on this sub?

       So whenever the side you support gets caught red-handed, you can just say it was probably a false flag by the other side? Seems a convenient method to never accept wrongdoing and constantly smear the other side.

       People don't have much knowledge about these shill groups because frankly they don't want to know.

       I asked for evidence, you have provided none.
      </p>
      <p>
       Last "evidence" I saw was the claim that "Russians" mass joined T_D due to Donald Jr's meeting with the Fusion shill. The fact that happened on the day that the rest of reddit decided to censor the Pulse shooting didn't phase any of those probing the claim.
      </p>
      <p>
       The previous claim was when a near billionaire donated 10k to set up a site and then immediately went to Chelsea Clinton's newspaper to say he was paying people to shill.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, excuse me for asking for evidence. I know the concept is hard for you.

       Hillary has analysts get her demographic data. In no way shape or form was that ever "shilling" or "proof of shilling".

       It was the fact her CTR/Shareblue idiots got directly caught out shilling that had it confirmed they used shills.

       What evidence would be conclusive? Share Blue's statement that they've done PP on Reddit certainly isn't. They've never said anything about r/conspiracy and honestly this sub is too small to be worth it.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is the exact same amount of evidence showing that Share Blue is on this sub as there is CA.

       Now answer my question - if SB was here, why wouldn't CA also be here? Wouldn't it be a failure on their part to not?

       Aaaaand our reader blue boy shares his wisdom.

      <p>
       Once again the claim boils down to...
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Overwhelming verifiable evidence that CTR/Shareblue is real and constantly brigading
       </li>

       Met with...
      </p>
      <p>
       "Trump shills are also here!"
      </p>
      <p>
       What's your evidence for this?
      </p>
      <p>
       "Because both sides must be doing it!"
      </p>
      <p>
       And yet no evidence ever comes up.
      </p>
      <p>
       We have this desperate thread trying to counter-op the current thread on CTR/Shareblue shills claiming a analytics company researching demographics for political purposes (that
       <strong>
        every
       </strong>
       politician does on some level and was
       <strong>
        never
       </strong>
       shilling even when Hillary did it) is somehow shills. Because analysing information is apparently shilling now.
      </p>
      <p>
       And the other one was that hilariously idiotic "see
       <a href="/r/The_Donald">
        /r/The_Donald
       </a>
       spiked in users at this time and date! Shills!" while
       <strong>
        conveniently leaving out that it was during the Orlando shooting when T_D was one of the ONLY subs not censoring the incident and news about the incident

       This is a conspiracy sub. Long before you came we were discussing Obama creating and funding Isis, the false flags in Libya, Syria, Iraq. Soros, Rockefeller, Rothschilds. The means to achieving a NWO.
      </p>
      <p>
       For better or worse, Trump has put an end to the distinct direction we were being pushed.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you knew me beyond the "hitlist" that is passed around with mine and other regular posters names on it, you'd know the issues I care about, the ways I try to protect my family and others. But now I'm just a target to many.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can freely post anywhere, while I've been banned from most subs, targeted with vote manipulation, threatened, stalked, and called almost every name there is. You'd know me as username untumulted.
      </p>
      <p>
       But you care about none of that and no one has any idea about what you care about. You care about a single thing. You listed some of your partisan posts. Two were. One wasn't. You try to paint Trump as part of the establishment by saying this sub shouldn't care about left right, but you are just trying to pre-empt debate and by default claim Trump is part of the establishment.

       Everyone is entitled to their own opinions. I think Pizzagate is false as well, but I don't attack people for believing it and I don't try to discredit others.
      </p>
      <p>
       And if I'm wrong about this conspiracy, then I will admit that I was wrong just like I was wrong about Trump himself being under FBI investigation.
      </p>
      <p>
       The question is why do you care that I believe in this conspiracy and why are you attacking me on a personal level because of it?

       But, I'm still called a shill just because I'm a liberal and I'm anti Trump. I can't talk about the conspiracy involving Russia or anything else really, without someone or some group trying to attack me on a personal level.

       Well the trump Russia conspiracy is main stream and you can go talk about it over in r /politics. That's the only reason they call you a shill. I'm a liberal and I think people need to stop falling for the Russia distraction and focus on the real issues.

       I cant believe there are people in this topic claiming Cambridge Analytica didn't do anythin and that ShareBlue is on a bigger level than CA. What nonsense, nobody can come close to what CA can do.
      </p>
      <p>
       CA is owned by Robert Mercer, what else does he own and fund? Oh yeah Breitbart.... infowars.... who got Bannon and Conway their jobs? Oh thats right Robert Mercer. Who ran the online psy-ops and misinformation campaigns? Robert Mercer and CA. Did he do this with just the US election? Nope, he was also behind Brexit, Le Penn, Wilders.

       Americans have been well and truly duped by super-rich far-right Americans into thinking its all about Russia and the "the left" or "the right" - no it IS abut the super-rich they have performed a coup of your country and they are far-right nutjobs. This is the "elite class" v's the rest of us common folk. This is what this sub has been waiting for for a decade and its hear and its happened and all the information is readily available online and yet the vast majority of you have turned a blind eye to it. Why? Because you got caught up in the psy-ops techniques, they worked on you, now you just want to burn the muslims and kick out the mexicans and blame the Russians for it all.

      <p>
       Project Alamo got $70 million a month and data from Cambridge Analytica to quote "cultivate a universe of millions of fervent Trump supporters".

       Sure, let's them hold them accountable! Let's first figure out the seriousness of what should be held accountable.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact is that the GOP and Trump used way, way more social media astroturfing than CTR did.

       $70 million in one payment alone compared to $7 million.

       You tell me which one is the bigger problem by a size of ten, and then you tell me who should be hearing more protests by an amount of 10.

       Holding them accountable doesn't mean you dismiss one side while rallying against "CTR/Shareblue" (the smaller of the two problems.)

       Why do you imply holding both of them accountable as though both did the same thing to the same level?

       Why not go after the much larger source of the problem, rather than ignoring the larger source to go after the smaller fish?

       You made a whole edit to your post, so I had to make a new response.

       You're the one engaging in whataboutism. Why is it every time a right-wing figure is held to the fire, suddenly "WE'RE BIPARTISTAN" comes out of the woodworks to detract from that conversation.
      </p>
      <p>
       What kind of person who engages in actual non-partisan behavior needs to deflect with the same lines every, single, time? Yet I don't see those lines repeated by the same people when the opposite happens.
      </p>
      <p>
       Did you make this post in the thread about CTR/Shareblue? No? How come? You should be making that bipartisan statement known in both threads if you truly felt that way.

        Yes or no? It's really as simple as that.

      <p>
       At a certain level it's pretty unavoidable. However I don't think it should be tolerated, and there should be pushback.
      </p>
      <p>
       That said the pushback should be at least equal, if not measured to the crime. If one person does 10x as many robberies, you would want to make sure the police focus their efforts on catching that one person moreso than another, correct?

       So why go after CTR/Shareblue when CA is loads worse? They were way were more active, and more effective on top of it.
      </p>
      <p>
       How does ignoring them to go after a lesser criminal make sense? Stop engaging in false equivalence on everything.

Which means, even if he tanks at the polls in two weeks, he could turn around and sell the data to other campaigns, use it to foment a larger fringe political movement, or even make "Project Alamo" the basis for a new Right-Wing media empire – you know, like Trump TV.

       Explain this data to me. Leftwing shilling is on reddit. They brigade far left leaning subs, We are not getting R trolls brigading the subs, they're all corporate D's. There are subs designed to do nothing more than post what the sub posts and criticize it. These are corporate neoliberal D's doing this. Not Trump trolls or conservative viewpoints. Do R's engage in similar activities? I have no doubt, but on reddit specifically, is owned by shareblue.

       Gaslighting. As a 3rd party I can say that the 2nd comment started the whataboutism when they had to compare 7M vs 70M... but what about this exact thing they did to a larger scale?

       You're clearly not an authority on logical fallacies. When we're talking about astroturfing as a general topic, it's not whataboutism to compare companies and their activities on that field.
      </p>
      <p>
       As a matter of fact, this thread is even specifically about CA, and not about CTR. So focusing on the larger scale that CA operates is literally as on topic as you could be.
      </p>
      <p>
       TL;DR: Talking about CA's activities and funding in a thread about CA is the very topic of the conversation and bringing them up is the opposite of whataboutism.

       That isn't David Brock giving $40 million.

        spread this around.
       </a>
       It's a continuously-updated archive of all proven cases of shilling. There is everything from Cambridge Analytica, Russian shills, the United State's anti-Russian shilling, Israeli and British government shills, Turkish and Chinese shills, Warner Brothers and Microsoft, and even a time when the Clinton Campaign was caught shilling on some forum in 2007.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think the situation is actually a little bit worse than partisan cherry-picking of information about shilling. People don't seem to be aware of the amount of different entities that hire shills. There are so many of them that it basically guarantees that you will see paid-for content every day if you spend any amount of time on social media. I would bet that there are several different firms in the same Reddit threads if they hit

       No but he supports it via his daughter who has worked with Alex Jones to both back the tea party and push through certain "conspiracy theories". I've singled out Mercer mostly as he's the money and it's easy to follow the money but there are others involved too ofcourse. infowars is a part of this group.

       I didn't deliberately misrepresent, anything you misinterpreted. I said own/funds, he doesn't own infowars but he has funded infowars pro tea-party campaigns and "conspiracy theories" through his daughter who is pretty much the public face of Mercers operations - therefore he has funded infowars, albeit indirectly.

       No, that isn't what I said at all. What I said was that I am not part of it, because I am open to ideas from all sides and have voted for all sides and am not ranting and raving about "right wing nutjobs". Do right wing nutjobs exist? Sure they do, but they are rare and are not represented almost anywhere in Western governments. Everything has moved so far to the left, anytime a true conservative shows up (Rand Paul for example), the left loses it's shit because it's used to dealing with neo-cons, which are not any different than the leftists already in power - except the neo-cons want even bigger wars. I can tell you are a leftist because you are ranting about popular votes that you don't agree with and because you're comments are so condescendign to anyone that voted for Brexit, etc.

       No, but when the "far right" is not in the street torching shit like anti-fa, then it's pretty obvious you aren't actually concerned about real threats happening this instant. Let me know when Robert Mercer starts funding violence. Instead you are concerned with made up fantasy threats like Breitbart and Infowars and democratic voting processes that produce results (Brexit) you don't like.

       Stopped reading once you said I was shouting about "right wing nutjobs" - again I'm not talking about the right I'm talking about the far-right, I have always and only mentioned the far-right you can't differentiate.... because as much as you claim not be on a side you clearly are (hence your insistence that I'm a "leftist" and all the other ranting about "the left" who I have never defended anywhere in this discussion).

       Oh just as I was leaving and I saw your last line that I've been brainwashed into think the far left is the far right, you're the one who has been tricked. Hitler was far-right fascist, the whole of Europe knows that history has known that since before the start of WW2 (honestly go and read up on some fucking history).

       That's a direct quote from you. If your OP wasn't a "rant" then what was it? You really should keep reading, you might learn something.

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I don't agree with your definition of "far-right". You don't know anything about the right, much less the American right, because all you've ever had to deal with is the center, left and far left. You mentioned three events (Brexit, Wilders, Le Penn) and implied a fourth by mentioning Robert Mercer (Trump). To an American, Wilders and Le Penn do not seem to be far right, but I'm sure they seem that way to Europeans, but neither of them won, so who cares. You are worried about events that never happened. That leaves only Brexit and Trump. Trump is hardly far right and Brexit was a democratic vote. You shouldn't get upset when the public votes in a manner you don't like. It happens all the time and the pendulum will swing the other way in the not to distant future. There isn't anything wrong with the British desiring to reclaim some of their sovereignty and there isn't anything inherently right wing about it.

      <p>
       If you are attacking all the opposition of the left, it's a dead give away. Apologies if you aren't a leftist, but I can't help but notice you never explicitly denied it either. It's okay, it's not an insult.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Hitler was far-right fascist, the whole of Europe knows that history has known that since before the start of WW2 (honestly go and read up on some fucking history).

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       No he wasn't. He was a national socialist. It doesn't matter anyway though because fascism, socialism and communism are all far left. See, this is what I am talking. The mainstream has told you what the political spectrum is, and you stupidly believe it and are basing your comments off what you believe the political spectrum to be, but what you believe is a lie.

       I'm quite well educated thank you. Hitler and Stalin and Mao and Mussolini are about as far away from right wing as you can get. All you are doing is spouting the mainstream view of history you learned at the University from a bunch of professor who all call themselves socialist.

       I'm not basing anything on their name. They were socialists that implemented socialist ideas. Were they 100% pure uber socialists? Probably not. No government is 100% what they claim to be. No government is 100% capitalist or socialist etc. The NAZI's were socialist and being socialist doesn't preclude you from killing a whole lot of people, but being right wing does (or should) preclude you from implementing giant social programs, which is what the NAZI's did indeed do. It's you who needs the education. The NAZI's were socialist. They were also nationalist. Nationalism is not inherently right or left wing. Socialist globalist professors tell us that being nationalist is right wing, but it isn't. They have an agenda and use the university to push it. I know, I've been "educated" already as you are instructing me to do.

       Again, I've learned quite a bit about it. It's you who is closed minded. I've had a very good formal education and I've read and done my own research and decided the socialist professors pleading with us all to believe Hitler was right wing are incorrect. It's you that hasn't bothered to educate yourself outside of what your socialist professors at university tell you. It's you that is saying "I didn't read past". It's you that is close minded and has walled yourself off from the thoughts of others and new information.

       It's well documented that Hitler was a socialist. The only people who deny this fact are socialists. It really doesn't matter anyway. Assume he was a fascist as you say. Fascism is left wing, so he was still a leftist. I haven't actually accused you of doing anything except being close minded. I went to school and got "educated" (primary, middle, high school, pre and post grad school) as you advise. Then I pulled my head out of my ass and stopped simply repeating what socialist professors told me, read a lot of books and decided for myself what the truth was. All I want to believe is the truth. The truth cannot be told to you by some state funded university. The truth must be discovered. Those that say "I stopped reading", as you have, will never discover truth, because they are not open to any new information or discussion. What I am telling you is clearly very jarring. What you are telling me is the same mainstream crap you find everywhere, it's nothing new or special of different. I've heard all that before and I reject it because it's false, not because I desire to believe any one thing over another.

       We aren't even really talking about WWII, or at least, haven't yet. I'm not denying anything involving WWII. Hitler was a bad dude and he killed a lot of people. The past of Hitler's deeds is not hidden, I agree. However, academia is predominantly on the left and they have a vested interest in convincing people Hitler wasn't a socialist because they are socialists themselves. That fact isn't really hidden either. The political science and history professors are all desperate to convince us all that Hitler and fascism etc. is right wing because they are predominately left wing. Those same stupid fucks telling me Hitler is a far right socialist will tell me Donald Trump is a far right capitalist pig. They don't know what they are talking about. Capitalism and socialism are opposite one another. The truth is, anything the left doesn't want associated with itself it calls right wing. Socialism is right wing when we are talking about Hitler, but socialism is left wing when it's free healthcare and housing for people. They speak out of both sides of their mouth.

       You are the one who doesn't know anything about neo-liberalism. Ronald fucking Reagan was a neo-liberal. Is the cognitive dissonance stinging yet or do you have some more mental contortions to make?

       Haha at first you tried to make it look like you were against partisan division and then you ended up defining your partisan enemy. The rich elite aren't far right, they want socialism, but they want socialism for corporations only. If their business is failing they want it bailed out by the tax payer.

       If you think "the right" and the "far-right" are the same thing then I'm worried for you. I don't care about the division of right and left, the left have been duped too they're the ones mostly blaming Russia! I'm not picking a side but these people ARE loud and proud far-right (please again note, far-right not the right).

       Socialism for corporations doesn't make sense. It's called far-right politics, that's literally what it is. Government for corporations, not for people.
      </p>
      <p>
       Way closer to fascism than anything related to socialism. Corporate socialism is sort of an oxymoron.

       Socialism requires a massive bureaucracy with ever increasing power and authority given to the state. Fascism is where the state has ultimate power.   Socialism is the stepping stone to both Fascism and Communism. Both are just when the state has ultimate power and tries to mico manage everything.

       That's what happened under Stalin and all the people he set up as puppets yes, but that's not what the ideology of Socialism is about.
      </p>
      <p>
       Socialism is the Workers owning the Means if Productions jointly. The mines, the factories, the farms, ect. And there are approximately 10 million ideas what this looks like. In theory, the most basic form of modern Socialism in practice would be the Unions, and Co-Ops. Communism is also the step beyond Socialism where government and currency doesn't exist. The USSR never claimed to be Communist, in fact they called themselves State Capitalist whenever people asked when exactly they would have control over their place of employment.
      </p>
      <p>
       Originally Anarchism, Socialism, Communalism, and Communism where all considered cousins since they advocated for things like direct democracy, decentralized elected local councils, communally owned property, ect. Then Stalin convinced the Centrist wing (the Right-wing wanted Cooperatives to replace Capitalists, and the Left wanted everything to be run by elected village councils of the Bolshevik faction of the Communist Party that the only way to build Socialism was to "temporarily" centralize absolutely everything, and the rest is history.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look at the Catalonian Anarchists, they built a much nicer version of Socialism, but they were stabbed in the back on Stalin's orders, or Rojava in Syria today.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fascism on the other hand is mostly about rabid nationalism united under a strong leader with a cult of personality and economically is supposed to be based on Corporatism (no, this doesn't mean Rule by Corporations, at least in theory. In practice...) and reinforcing the social hierarchy as a source of stability.

       ''Fabian socialism is a type of socialism founded in 1884 in London.[1] It sought use of the democratic framework to achieve gradual conversion to socialism. This approach originated from the movement for utopian socialism. Its nine[2] founding members were Frank Podmore, Edward R. Pease, William Clarke, Hubert Bland,[3] Percival Chubb, Frederick Keddell,[2] Henry Hyde Champion,[4]Edith Nesbit,[5] and Rosamund Dale Owen.[2][3] Havelock Ellis is sometimes also mentioned as a tenth founding member, though there is some question about this.[2]

       Important Fabians includes George Bernard Shaw, Beatrice and Sidney Webb, Annie Besant, and Bertrand Russell.[6]

       The Fabians were influential in forming the ideas of the British Labour Party. They advocated the ideal of a scientifically planned society and supported the eugenics by way of sterilization.''

       They've been trying to get out ahead of people saying this because even they know it's true, and if people start actually believing it, the house of cards will fall.

       I'm not saying that the left doesn't engage in astroturfing, but it's a standard republican strategy to accuse the left of something very loudly, and then when it's swung right back they claim "partisan politics are destroying this country, the Republicans would love to work with the democrats but they can't stop being so partisan".

       I hate both conservatives and liberals so I can explain the differences here. Yes, both sides shill, the difference is the liberal shills are really bad at it, and it always comes off as too obvious. The liberal shills actually push people away, but they haven't seemed to have learned that yet.

       Is there a chance in god's green hell that these shilling operations could be banned on a federal level? Does anyone aside from employees and party insiders support these kinds of things? Certainly they're doing more harm than good, pretty much exist to only do harm and warp the public's opinions even more.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd vote to ban these operations and form a bipartisan, revolving team to actively fight against foreign shilling operations against the United States. It would be a maze of red tape and difficult logistics but I think it could work. The ban should also cover US IC shilling abroad. But good luck with all this, now that the world is shrunk to the internet that anyone around the globe can access, with any nefarious purpose in mind, I'm afraid this is how things are gonna be. And it will get worse.

       You're the one engaging in whataboutism. Why is it every time a right-wing figure is held to the fire, suddenly "WE'RE BIPARTISTAN" comes out of the woodworks to detract from that conversation.
      </p>
      <p>
       What kind of person who engages in actual non-partisan behavior needs to deflect with the same lines every, single, time? Yet I don't see those lines repeated by the same people when the opposite happens.
      </p>
      <p>
       Did you make this post in the thread about CTR/Shareblue? No? How come? You should be making that bipartisan statement known in both threads if you truly felt that way.

       At a certain level it's pretty unavoidable. However I don't think it should be tolerated, and there should be pushback.
      </p>
      <p>
       That said the pushback should be at least equal, if not measured to the crime. If one person does 10x as many robberies, you would want to make sure the police focus their efforts on catching that one person moreso than another, correct?

       How does ignoring them to go after a lesser criminal make sense? Stop engaging in false equivalence on everything.

       No, that isn't what I said at all. What I said was that I am not part of it, because I am open to ideas from all sides and have voted for all sides and am not ranting and raving about "right wing nutjobs". Do right wing nutjobs exist? Sure they do, but they are rare and are not represented almost anywhere in Western governments. Everything has moved so far to the left, anytime a true conservative shows up (Rand Paul for example), the left loses it's shit because it's used to dealing with neo-cons, which are not any different than the leftists already in power - except the neo-cons want even bigger wars. I can tell you are a leftist because you are ranting about popular votes that you don't agree with and because you're comments are so condescendign to anyone that voted for Brexit, etc.

       No, but when the "far right" is not in the street torching shit like anti-fa, then it's pretty obvious you aren't actually concerned about real threats happening this instant. Let me know when Robert Mercer starts funding violence. Instead you are concerned with made up fantasy threats like Breitbart and Infowars and democratic voting processes that produce results (Brexit) you don't like.

       Yeah, and if you are European you define Hitler as far right when he wasn't. The political spectrum you think exists is, doesn't. You've been brainwashed to think what is far left is in fact far right.

       I don't agree with your definition of "far-right". You don't know anything about the right, much less the American right, because all you've ever had to deal with is the center, left and far left. You mentioned three events (Brexit, Wilders, Le Penn) and implied a fourth by mentioning Robert Mercer (Trump). To an American, Wilders and Le Penn do not seem to be far right, but I'm sure they seem that way to Europeans, but neither of them won, so who cares. You are worried about events that never happened. That leaves only Brexit and Trump. Trump is hardly far right and Brexit was a democratic vote. You shouldn't get upset when the public votes in a manner you don't like. It happens all the time and the pendulum will swing the other way in the not to distant future. There isn't anything wrong with the British desiring to reclaim some of their sovereignty and there isn't anything inherently right wing about it.

       If you are attacking all the opposition of the left, it's a dead give away. Apologies if you aren't a leftist, but I can't help but notice you never explicitly denied it either. It's okay, it's not an insult.

       No he wasn't. He was a national socialist. It doesn't matter anyway though because fascism, socialism and communism are all far left. See, this is what I am talking.
