    <div class="md"><p>I asked for evidence, you have provided none. </p>

<p>Last &quot;evidence&quot; I saw was the claim that &quot;Russians&quot; mass joined T_D due to Donald Jr&#39;s meeting with the Fusion shill. The fact that happened on the day that the rest of reddit decided to censor the Pulse shooting didn&#39;t phase any of those probing the claim.</p>

<p>The previous claim was when a near billionaire donated 10k to set up a site and then immediately went to Chelsea Clinton&#39;s newspaper to say he was paying people to shill.</p>

<p>So, excuse me for asking for evidence. I know the concept is hard for you.</p>

<p>&quot;Trump shills are also here!&quot;</p>

<p>What&#39;s your evidence for this?</p>

<p>&quot;Because both sides must be doing it!&quot;</p>

<p>And yet no evidence ever comes up.</p>

<p>We have this desperate thread trying to counter-op the current thread on CTR/Shareblue shills claiming a analytics company researching demographics for political purposes (that <strong>every</strong> politician does on some level and was <strong>never</strong> shilling even when Hillary did it) is somehow shills. Because analysing information is apparently shilling now.</p>

<p>And the other one was that hilariously idiotic &quot;see <a href="/r/The_Donald">/r/The_Donald</a> spiked in users at this time and date!

    <div class="md"><p>This is a conspiracy sub. Long before you came we were discussing Obama creating and funding Isis, the false flags in Libya, Syria, Iraq. Soros, Rockefeller, Rothschilds. The means to achieving a NWO.</p>

<p>For better or worse, Trump has put an end to the distinct direction we were being pushed.</p>

<p>If you knew me beyond the &quot;hitlist&quot; that is passed around with mine and other regular posters names on it, you&#39;d know the issues I care about, the ways I try to protect my family and others. But now I&#39;m just a target to many. </p>

<p>You can freely post anywhere, while I&#39;ve been banned from most subs, targeted with vote manipulation, threatened, stalked, and called almost every name there is. You&#39;d know me as username untumulted. </p>

<p>But you care about none of that and no one has any idea about what you care about. You care about a single thing. You listed some of your partisan posts. Two were. One wasn&#39;t. You try to paint Trump as part of the establishment by saying this sub shouldn&#39;t care about left right, but you are just trying to pre-empt debate and by default claim Trump is part of the establishment. </p>

<p>I judge by the fruit. </p>

<p>Sure, let&#39;s them hold them accountable! Let&#39;s first figure out the seriousness of what should be held accountable. </p>

<p>The fact is that the GOP and Trump used way, way more social media astroturfing than CTR did. </p>

<p>$70 million in one payment alone compared to $7 million. </p>

<p>You tell me which one is the bigger problem by a size of ten, and then you tell me who should be hearing more protests by an amount of 10. </p>

<p>Holding them accountable doesn&#39;t mean you dismiss one side while rallying against &quot;CTR/Shareblue&quot; (the smaller of the two problems.) </p>

<p>Fuck the whataboutism.</p>

<p>You&#39;re the one engaging in whataboutism. Why is it every time a right-wing figure is held to the fire, suddenly &quot;WE&#39;RE BIPARTISTAN&quot; comes out of the woodworks to detract from that conversation. </p>

<p>What kind of person who engages in actual non-partisan behavior needs to deflect with the same lines every, single, time? Yet I don&#39;t see those lines repeated by the same people when the opposite happens. </p>

<p>Did you make this post in the thread about CTR/Shareblue? No? How come? You should be making that bipartisan statement known in both threads if you truly felt that way. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Yes or no? It&#39;s really as simple as that.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>At a certain level it&#39;s pretty unavoidable. However I don&#39;t think it should be tolerated, and there should be pushback. </p>

<p>That said the pushback should be at least equal, if not measured to the crime. If one person does 10x as many robberies, you would want to make sure the police focus their efforts on catching that one person moreso than another, correct? </p>

<blockquote>

<p>Sounds very non-partisan of you. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>It&#39;s despicable, that is the whole point.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So why go after CTR/Shareblue when CA is loads worse? They were way were more active, and more effective on top of it. </p>

<p>How does ignoring them to go after a lesser criminal make sense? Stop engaging in false equivalence on everything. </p>

<p>Explain this data to me. Leftwing shilling is on reddit. They brigade far left leaning subs, We are not getting R trolls brigading the subs, they&#39;re all corporate D&#39;s. There are subs designed to do nothing more than post what the sub posts and criticize it. These are corporate neoliberal D&#39;s doing this. Not Trump trolls or conservative viewpoints. Do R&#39;s engage in similar activities? I have no doubt, but on reddit specifically, is owned by shareblue.</p>

There is everything from Cambridge Analytica, Russian shills, the United State&#39;s anti-Russian shilling, Israeli and British government shills, Turkish and Chinese shills, Warner Brothers and Microsoft, and even a time when the Clinton Campaign was caught shilling on some forum in 2007.  </p>

<p>I think the situation is actually a little bit worse than partisan cherry-picking of information about shilling. People don&#39;t seem to be aware of the amount of different entities that hire shills.

<p>A rich person with money funds things. Whatever are we to do! Do you know of better alt-news sources? I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll suggest we should be tuning into CNN and CBS and reading Snopes and Salon like good, smart, educated citizens. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>who got Bannon and Conway their jobs?</p>

<p>Oh no, he got people he likes, that previously worked for him, jobs! The horror! Alert the presses!</p>

<p>Who ran the online psy-ops and misinformation campaigns?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Which dis-information campaigns were those? The ones that showed Hillary falling over and making faces like a retard at Christmas? I don&#39;t think we need dis-information campaigns or psy-ops to show that Hillary is an old, frail woman.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Did he do this with just the US election? Nope, he was also behind Brexit, Le Penn, Wilders.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Oh no, he supports political movements he agree&#39;s with! The horror, the shame! It&#39;s not allowed unless you fund violent anti-fa thugs! Oh, by the way, Le Penn and Wilders lost, so you&#39;ll have to forgive me if I don&#39;t think Robert Mercer is some kind of Wizard of Oz.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Americans have been well and truly duped by super-rich far-right Americans into thinking its all about Russia and the &quot;the left&quot; or &quot;the right&quot; - no, it IS about the super-rich they have performed a coup of your country and they are far-right nutjobs.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yeah, I am sure Soros and the Rothschilds and the Bush&#39;s and the Clintons and the Rockefellers are all right wing nutjobs. The right isn&#39;t saying anything about Russia except telling the left they are stupid for talking about it so much (which they are). Has the country been captured? Yeah, a long damn time ago by globalists that are anything but right wing. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>This is the &quot;elite class&quot; v&#39;s the rest of us common folk.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is true, but you haven&#39;t even correctly identified who the &quot;elite&quot; are. Robert Mercer has a lot of money. He&#39;s not in the &quot;elite&quot; clubs and he if were, he wouldn&#39;t be on the losing side of half the political movements he backs. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>This is what this sub has been waiting for for over a decade and its here and its happened and all the information is readily available online and yet the vast majority of you have turned a blind eye to it. Why?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No it isn&#39;t what anyone has been waiting for. We turn a blind eye because it&#39;s stupid and the theory is pushed by the MSM and the same people who tell us conspiracy theorists are crazy and conspiracy theory doesn&#39;t exist...until their precious Hillary loses, then it&#39;s all the Russians fault and all the people who have studied conspiracy their whole lives are again called stupid for not believing the only conspiracy theory the MSM ever said was true. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Because you got caught up in the psy-ops techniques, they worked on you, now you just want to burn the muslims and kick out the mexicans and blame the Russians for it all.</p>

<p>Yeah, no. That&#39;s the retards version of events. The only people blaming Russia are the same people who blame CA for things they don&#39;t like. </p>

<p>No, that isn&#39;t what I said at all. What I said was that I am not part of it, because I am open to ideas from all sides and have voted for all sides and am not ranting and raving about &quot;right wing nutjobs&quot;. Do right wing nutjobs exist? Sure they do, but they are rare and are not represented almost anywhere in Western governments. Everything has moved so far to the left, anytime a true conservative shows up (Rand Paul for example), the left loses it&#39;s shit because it&#39;s used to dealing with neo-cons, which are not any different than the leftists already in power - except the neo-cons want even bigger wars. I can tell you are a leftist because you are ranting about popular votes that you don&#39;t agree with and because you&#39;re comments are so condescendign to anyone that voted for Brexit, etc. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>No, but when the &quot;far right&quot; is not in the street torching shit like anti-fa, then it&#39;s pretty obvious you aren&#39;t actually concerned about real threats happening this instant.

Instead you are concerned with made up fantasy threats like Breitbart and Infowars and democratic voting processes that produce results (Brexit) you don&#39;t like. </p>

<p>Yeah, and if you are European you define Hitler as far right when he wasn&#39;t. The political spectrum you think exists is, doesn&#39;t. You&#39;ve been brainwashed to think what is far left is in fact far right. </p>

<p>That&#39;s a direct quote from you. If your OP wasn&#39;t a &quot;rant&quot; then what was it? You really should keep reading, you might learn something. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>again I&#39;m not talking about the right I&#39;m talking about the far-right</p>

<p>I don&#39;t agree with your definition of &quot;far-right&quot;. You don&#39;t know anything about the right, much less the American right, because all you&#39;ve ever had to deal with is the center, left and far left. You mentioned three events (Brexit, Wilders, Le Penn) and implied a fourth by mentioning Robert Mercer (Trump). To an American, Wilders and Le Penn do not seem to be far right, but I&#39;m sure they seem that way to Europeans, but neither of them won, so who cares. You are worried about events that never happened. That leaves only Brexit and Trump. Trump is hardly far right and Brexit was a democratic vote. You shouldn&#39;t get upset when the public votes in a manner you don&#39;t like. It happens all the time and the pendulum will swing the other way in the not to distant future. There isn&#39;t anything wrong with the British desiring to reclaim some of their sovereignty and there isn&#39;t anything inherently right wing about it. </p>

<p>If you are attacking all the opposition of the left, it&#39;s a dead give away. Apologies if you aren&#39;t a leftist, but I can&#39;t help but notice you never explicitly denied it either. It&#39;s okay, it&#39;s not an insult. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hitler was far-right fascist, the whole of Europe knows that history has known that since before the start of WW2 (honestly go and read up on some fucking history).</p>

<p>No he wasn&#39;t. He was a national socialist. It doesn&#39;t matter anyway though because fascism, socialism and communism are all far left. See, this is what I am talking. The mainstream has told you what the political spectrum is, and you stupidly believe it and are basing your comments off what you believe the political spectrum to be, but what you believe is a lie. </p>

<p>My apologies. However, it&#39;s a distinction without a difference, the meaning is the same. </p>

<p>No he wasn&#39;t. He was a nationalist and a socialist. Europeans just don&#39;t like to hear the truth because they still believe in socialism. I&#39;m sorry your fantasy is not reality. </p>

<p>I&#39;m quite well educated thank you. Hitler and Stalin and Mao and Mussolini are about as far away from right wing as you can get. All you are doing is spouting the mainstream view of history you learned at the University from a bunch of professor who all call themselves socialist. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not basing anything on their name. They were socialists that implemented socialist ideas. Were they 100% pure uber socialists? Probably not. No government is 100% what they claim to be. No government is 100% capitalist or socialist etc. The NAZI&#39;s were socialist and being socialist doesn&#39;t preclude you from killing a whole lot of people, but being right wing does (or should) preclude you from implementing giant social programs, which is what the NAZI&#39;s did indeed do. It&#39;s you who needs the education. The NAZI&#39;s were socialist. They were also nationalist. Nationalism is not inherently right or left wing. Socialist globalist professors tell us that being nationalist is right wing, but it isn&#39;t. They have an agenda and use the university to push it. I know, I&#39;ve been &quot;educated&quot; already as you are instructing me to do.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Read the paragraph above again. You are the only one making assumptions. You are assuming that I am basing my comments off the fact that the NAZI&#39;s called themselves socialists. I&#39;m not.</p>

<p>Again, I&#39;ve learned quite a bit about it. It&#39;s you who is closed minded. I&#39;ve had a very good formal education and I&#39;ve read and done my own research and decided the socialist professors pleading with us all to believe Hitler was right wing are incorrect. It&#39;s you that hasn&#39;t bothered to educate yourself outside of what your socialist professors at university tell you. It&#39;s you that is saying &quot;I didn&#39;t read past&quot;. It&#39;s you that is close minded and has walled yourself off from the thoughts of others and new information. </p>

<p>It&#39;s well documented that Hitler was a socialist. The only people who deny this fact are socialists. It really doesn&#39;t matter anyway. Assume he was a fascist as you say. Fascism is left wing, so he was still a leftist. I haven&#39;t actually accused you of doing anything except being close minded. I went to school and got &quot;educated&quot; (primary, middle, high school, pre and post grad school) as you advise. Then I pulled my head out of my ass and stopped simply repeating what socialist professors told me, read a lot of books and decided for myself what the truth was. All I want to believe is the truth. The truth cannot be told to you by some state funded university. The truth must be discovered. Those that say &quot;I stopped reading&quot;, as you have, will never discover truth, because they are not open to any new information or discussion. What I am telling you is clearly very jarring. What you are telling me is the same mainstream crap you find everywhere, it&#39;s nothing new or special of different. I&#39;ve heard all that before and I reject it because it&#39;s false, not because I desire to believe any one thing over another. </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>We aren&#39;t even really talking about WWII, or at least, haven&#39;t yet. I&#39;m not denying anything involving WWII. Hitler was a bad dude and he killed a lot of people. The past of Hitler&#39;s deeds is not hidden, I agree. However, academia is predominantly on the left and they have a vested interest in convincing people Hitler wasn&#39;t a socialist because they are socialists themselves. That fact isn&#39;t really hidden either. The political science and history professors are all desperate to convince us all that Hitler and fascism etc. is right wing because they are predominately left wing. Those same stupid fucks telling me Hitler is a far right socialist will tell me Donald Trump is a far right capitalist pig. They don&#39;t know what they are talking about. Capitalism and socialism are opposite one another. The truth is, anything the left doesn&#39;t want associated with itself it calls right wing. Socialism is right wing when we are talking about Hitler, but socialism is left wing when it&#39;s free healthcare and housing for people. They speak out of both sides of their mouth. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s what happened under Stalin and all the people he set up as puppets yes, but that&#39;s not what the ideology of Socialism is about.</p>

<p>Socialism is the Workers owning the Means if Productions jointly. The mines, the factories, the farms, ect. And there are approximately 10 million ideas what this looks like. In theory, the most basic form of modern Socialism in practice would be the Unions, and Co-Ops. Communism is also the step beyond Socialism where government and currency doesn&#39;t exist. The USSR never claimed to be Communist, in fact they called themselves State Capitalist whenever people asked when exactly they would have control over their place of employment.</p>

<p>Originally Anarchism, Socialism, Communalism, and Communism where all considered cousins since they advocated for things like direct democracy, decentralized elected local councils, communally owned property, ect. Then Stalin convinced the Centrist wing (the Right-wing wanted Cooperatives to replace Capitalists, and the Left wanted everything to be run by elected village councils of the Bolshevik faction of the Communist Party that the only way to build Socialism was to &quot;temporarily&quot; centralize absolutely everything, and the rest is history. </p>

<p>Look at the Catalonian Anarchists, they built a much nicer version of Socialism, but they were stabbed in the back on Stalin&#39;s orders, or Rojava in Syria today.</p>

<p>Fascism on the other hand is mostly about rabid nationalism united under a strong leader with a cult of personality and economically is supposed to be based on Corporatism (no, this doesn&#39;t mean Rule by Corporations, at least in theory. In practice...) and reinforcing the social hierarchy as a source of stability.</p>

&#39;&#39;Fabian socialism is a type of socialism founded in 1884 in London.[1] It sought use of the democratic framework to achieve gradual conversion to socialism. This approach originated from the movement for utopian socialism. Its nine[2] founding members were Frank Podmore, Edward R. Pease, William Clarke, Hubert Bland,[3] Percival Chubb, Frederick Keddell,[2] Henry Hyde Champion,[4]Edith Nesbit,[5] and Rosamund Dale Owen.[2][3] Havelock Ellis is sometimes also mentioned as a tenth founding member, though there is some question about this.[2]</p>

<p>Important Fabians includes George Bernard Shaw, Beatrice and Sidney Webb, Annie Besant, and Bertrand Russell.[6]</p>

<p>The Fabians were influential in forming the ideas of the British Labour Party. They advocated the ideal of a scientifically planned society and supported the eugenics by way of sterilization.&#39;&#39;<br/>

    <div class="md"><p>Is there a chance in god&#39;s green hell that these shilling operations could be banned on a federal level? Does anyone aside from employees and party insiders support these kinds of things? Certainly they&#39;re doing more harm than good, pretty much exist to only do harm and warp the public&#39;s opinions even more. </p>

<p>I&#39;d vote to ban these operations and form a bipartisan, revolving team to actively fight against foreign shilling operations against the United States. It would be a maze of red tape and difficult logistics but I think it could work. The ban should also cover US IC shilling abroad. But good luck with all this, now that the world is shrunk to the internet that anyone around the globe can access, with any nefarious purpose in mind, I&#39;m afraid this is how things are gonna be. And it will get worse.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You made a whole edit to your post, so I had to make a new response. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Fuck the whataboutism.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You&#39;re the one engaging in whataboutism. Why is it every time a right-wing figure is held to the fire, suddenly &quot;WE&#39;RE BIPARTISTAN&quot; comes out of the woodworks to detract from that conversation. </p>

<p>What kind of person who engages in actual non-partisan behavior needs to deflect with the same lines every, single, time? Yet I don&#39;t see those lines repeated by the same people when the opposite happens. </p>

<p>Did you make this post in the thread about CTR/Shareblue? No? How come? You should be making that bipartisan statement known in both threads if you truly felt that way. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Yes or no? It&#39;s really as simple as that.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>At a certain level it&#39;s pretty unavoidable. However I don&#39;t think it should be tolerated, and there should be pushback. </p>

<p>That said the pushback should be at least equal, if not measured to the crime. If one person does 10x as many robberies, you would want to make sure the police focus their efforts on catching that one person moreso than another, correct? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I am sick of seeing D&#39;s criticize R&#39;s</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sounds very non-partisan of you. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>It&#39;s despicable, that is the whole point.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So why go after CTR/Shareblue when CA is loads worse? They were way were more active, and more effective on top of it. </p>

<p>How does ignoring them to go after a lesser criminal make sense? Stop engaging in false equivalence on everything. </p>

<p>Hmm you claim you&#39;re not part of it yet claim the fact I see the danger in the far-right makes me a &quot;leftist&quot;.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, that isn&#39;t what I said at all. What I said was that I am not part of it, because I am open to ideas from all sides and have voted for all sides and am not ranting and raving about &quot;right wing nutjobs&quot;. Do right wing nutjobs exist? Sure they do, but they are rare and are not represented almost anywhere in Western governments. Everything has moved so far to the left, anytime a true conservative shows up (Rand Paul for example), the left loses it&#39;s shit because it&#39;s used to dealing with neo-cons, which are not any different than the leftists already in power - except the neo-cons want even bigger wars. I can tell you are a leftist because you are ranting about popular votes that you don&#39;t agree with and because you&#39;re comments are so condescendign to anyone that voted for Brexit, etc. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>You don&#39;t have to be a part of any side, have a political stand-point or believe in any ideology to dislike the far-right.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, but when the &quot;far right&quot; is not in the street torching shit like anti-fa, then it&#39;s pretty obvious you aren&#39;t actually concerned about real threats happening this instant. Let me know when Robert Mercer starts funding violence. Instead you are concerned with made up fantasy threats like Breitbart and Infowars and democratic voting processes that produce results (Brexit) you don&#39;t like. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Note, I am talking about the far-right not the right. Far-right thinking is a very dangerous thing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yeah, and if you are European you define Hitler as far right when he wasn&#39;t. The political spectrum you think exists is, doesn&#39;t. You&#39;ve been brainwashed to think what is far left is in fact far right. </p>

<p>Stopped reading once you said I was shouting about &quot;right wing nutjobs&quot; </p>

<p>That&#39;s a direct quote from you. If your OP wasn&#39;t a &quot;rant&quot; then what was it? You really should keep reading, you might learn something. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>again I&#39;m not talking about the right I&#39;m talking about the far-right</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t agree with your definition of &quot;far-right&quot;. You don&#39;t know anything about the right, much less the American right, because all you&#39;ve ever had to deal with is the center, left and far left. You mentioned three events (Brexit, Wilders, Le Penn) and implied a fourth by mentioning Robert Mercer (Trump). To an American, Wilders and Le Penn do not seem to be far right, but I&#39;m sure they seem that way to Europeans, but neither of them won, so who cares. You are worried about events that never happened. That leaves only Brexit and Trump. Trump is hardly far right and Brexit was a democratic vote. You shouldn&#39;t get upset when the public votes in a manner you don&#39;t like. It happens all the time and the pendulum will swing the other way in the not to distant future. There isn&#39;t anything wrong with the British desiring to reclaim some of their sovereignty and there isn&#39;t anything inherently right wing about it. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>hence your insistence that I&#39;m a &quot;leftist&quot; and all the other ranting about &quot;the left&quot; who I have never defended anywhere in this discussion</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you are attacking all the opposition of the left, it&#39;s a dead give away. Apologies if you aren&#39;t a leftist, but I can&#39;t help but notice you never explicitly denied it either. It&#39;s okay, it&#39;s not an insult. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hitler was far-right fascist, the whole of Europe knows that history has known that since before the start of WW2 (honestly go and read up on some fucking history).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No he wasn&#39;t. He was a national socialist. It doesn&#39;t matter anyway though because fascism, socialism and communism are all far left. See, this is what I am talking. The mainstream has told you what the political spectrum is, and you stupidly believe it and are basing your comments off what you believe the political spectrum to be, but what you believe is a lie. </p>

<p>I didn&#39;t lie about anything. Saying &quot;right wing nutjob&quot; and &quot;far right nutjob&quot; is the same meaning. I misquoted you, but got the meaning right. I never lied and apologized for the misquote. If you accuse everyone of lies for such small mistakes, no wonder you think the stupid shit you do, it&#39;s unlikely you ever listen to anyone. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t need to because I already know what he was. You are the one who is lost. But fuck it, hit me with your best shot. I&#39;m open minded. Educate me on how Hitler was right wing. It should be fun watching you explain how nationalizing industry and providing huge worker programs is right wing. </p>
