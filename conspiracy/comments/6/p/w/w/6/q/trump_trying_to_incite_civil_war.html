    <div class="md"><p>Russia wants a civil war type of situation.  Antifa is likely supported by Russia.  Alt Right is also.  What they are planning on doing is what happened to the Romanov family back 100 years ago.  We may be witnessing the toppling of a major empire which is the US.  Anons on 4chan know stuff is happening specifically and then they submit a kind of date leak to gain trust.  </p>

<p>The Russian sanctions should have been more internet based and not energy company based.  Right now we need a strong internet presence in either the US congress or in the executive branch which I don&#39;t feel we do.  </p>

<p>Threatening Alaska shows his emotional weakness and how he is losing his political party.  Trump wants to remove Obama&#39;s laws that he put in place as revenge.  This includes Russian sanctions.  Anyone that gets in his way, will lash out to them.  Trump values the attention and ratings more than anything.  If he started seeing a dramatic drop in twitter followers, he may come to his senses and start taking this with stronger emotional intelligence.  You do not threaten things you care about.  </p>

<p>Russia&#39;s governmental change back in 1918 was very similar.  You had a not so much respected leader who is constantly losing that respect, distrust over a previous and current war (Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria), the distrust of government officials, fractured news sources that insult others, and if Trump does get impeached an ill prepared leader (Russia at the time had multiple assassination attempts which lead to the early death of Alexander.  Nicholas was not rightfully prepared for being a leader).  There is a perfect storm for a major upheaval if key parties don&#39;t get their act together which includes a huge change in control which could destabilize the entire world.</p>
