       First off, I have no evidence backing this.
      </p>
      <p>
       It seems as if he wants this country to collapse in on itself. I don't have to list all of the bullshit he has done, because it's too easy to find by quick web search.
      </p>
      <p>
       Threatening Alaska is a blatant act of aggression. The "president" threatened the future of one of his own states. I mean, come the fuck on. Who does that?

       Very fair point. They considered cutting federal funding and that hung over NC for six weeks, until they decided not to and pursued legal action instead.

       He is "bullying" Alaska because Alaska depends heavily on federal funding. It seems to be working, because the "tough" Alaskans are scared shitless.

       Not really. If Alaska became independent the citizens there have enough natural resources that every Alaskan would be a millionaire. Would Russia "annex" Alaska? It seems more likely that China would  do that.

       There is a concerted effort to rip the USA apart - but it's WAY over Trump's head, and has been going on for a long time.
      </p>
      <p>
       It has escalated over the past year, with the election etc, but to blame it solely on Trump would be simplistic.

       Russia wants a civil war type of situation.  Antifa is likely supported by Russia.  Alt Right is also.  What they are planning on doing is what happened to the Romanov family back 100 years ago.  We may be witnessing the toppling of a major empire which is the US.  Anons on 4chan know stuff is happening specifically and then they submit a kind of date leak to gain trust.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Russian sanctions should have been more internet based and not energy company based.  Right now we need a strong internet presence in either the US congress or in the executive branch which I don't feel we do.
      </p>
      <p>
       Threatening Alaska shows his emotional weakness and how he is losing his political party.  Trump wants to remove Obama's laws that he put in place as revenge.  This includes Russian sanctions.  Anyone that gets in his way, will lash out to them.  Trump values the attention and ratings more than anything.  If he started seeing a dramatic drop in twitter followers, he may come to his senses and start taking this with stronger emotional intelligence.  You do not threaten things you care about.
      </p>
      <p>
       Russia's governmental change back in 1918 was very similar.  You had a not so much respected leader who is constantly losing that respect, distrust over a previous and current war (Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria), the distrust of government officials, fractured news sources that insult others, and if Trump does get impeached an ill prepared leader (Russia at the time had multiple assassination attempts which lead to the early death of Alexander.  Nicholas was not rightfully prepared for being a leader).  There is a perfect storm for a major upheaval if key parties don't get their act together which includes a huge change in control which could destabilize the entire world.

       I absolutely agree with what you said. I think that if America starts to collapse, there would be a couple other countries coming in to "liberate" us.

       Fist off, civil war will never happen, the military is to fucking powerful and the elites have full control of the media. If anything starts , they would block any internet access and make people really on TV for information, then they would neutralize any opposition to their power.
      </p>
      <p>
       It would so bad to the point if you lived in one city you wouldn't know what was happening in the next town over and they would not let you move from where you are.
      </p>
      <p>
       After order is restored they would start Purging the undesirables give excuses as that got infected with a virus and they need to be place in quarantine....
      </p>
      <p>
       The total population would be reduced to a bout 1/3.  And this would not only happen here but all over the world.

       Then stop saying that civil war is possible... I can see you have the mentality of " if we all unite, we can do anything"...  The only time when tyrants fall is when the military trun a blind eye.

      <p>
       As of now the only thing the military want is more AI wepons and less soldiers machines don't have loyalty they have code and you do as they are told.

       There is only 3 ways to have a change of government.

      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         The Rich fight against themselves ... (I am sorry to say they are working together, tell me do you know who where really pushing for the US civil war? Let me tell you rich Kings .)
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The military takes control of the government( I doubt we have executive officer willing to do anything against the  government)

       So, with these examples, your statement saying that a civil war is not possible is a direct contradiction.

       You just listed three ways to make it possible.

       Doesn't matter who the president is. It's all theatre. If anyone is trying to start a civil war it is the controllers of our nation that hide in the shadows. Do some more digging on this sub and keep an open mind; you will figure it out in time.
