       Awan had all of the passwords for the emails that were LEAKED, remember, they were LEAKED not HACKED. This all goes back to Seth Rich. all the poor brainwashed liberals are going to have a real case of cognitive dissonance once all of the disinformation that you believed is proven to be false. The only collusion was between Hillary and Ukraine. Try and keep up.

       It was leaked and you saying that it was a hack only proves that you haven't been following this long enough. It was leaked due to a phishing scam, try again.

       But... no one HACKED into anything, they obtained the emails simply by entering a password and then LEAKING the information. They didn't hack to get his password, he gave it to them, there was zero hacking involved. It's not our fault that you don't know the difference.

       It's literally the definition of hacking. Using a computer to gain unauthorized access to data in a system. Stealing someone's password is hacking. This isn't hard stuff big guy. Just go open a dictionary.

       Damage control for what? Leaking emails? Rigging the democratic primary elections? Murdering people investigating me? Being tied to multiple pedophiles like John Podesta, Kurt Eichenwald, Jeffrey Epstein, or Kevin Spacey? Giving a candidate questions before a debate illegally? Bussing in voters from other states illegally? Running a pay for play "foundation" that has implications of human trafficking?

       Typical tactic of someone who just lost a debate. You're attacking me instead of my post and the facts that I provided. Pretty strange name you have there for a leftist. You must be a southern democrat with KKK in the middle of your name. And only one post on your history, ever... strange.

       Our entire government believes the proof they've been given. Including Trumps director of the CIA. Again, they only people who don't believe it are some bitter Bernie guys, and Trumo supporters. Everyone else disagrees with you. And they have a lot more access to the investigations than we do.

       I honestly don't know what your talking about with manafort. And the reason no one cares about Russia is because no one has provided any proof that Russia did anything to"intervene" in the election. And before you try and provide a bunch of links documenting Trump's Ally's connections to various Russians, save your time because what I'm actually asking for is you to provide me evidence that Russia "intervened" in the election. Meaning, what did they do to cause Hillary to lose, directly, no unnamed sources please.

       I have plenty. This isn't a partisan issue. The Senate just voted 98-2 for new sanctions on Russia for interfering in our election. Trumps director of the CIA knows it was Russia. Literally everyone who has been investigating this says it was Russia. The only people who don't believe it are trump and his supporters. So enjoy your fantasy land. Good luck with the criminal investigation.

       Yeah the only problem is that all of these people saying it was Russia don't actually have any proof that Russia did anything. The Russians allegedly hacked the dnc, yet they refuse to allow any intelligence agency to inspect their network. Fyi, I'm not a trump supporter, I voted for Bernie and Jill Stein, but good job making yourself look like a fool by making baseless assumptions

       Hah. Right. Julian has never said who his source was. He just keeps hinting that it's Seth Rich to throw you guys off the trail because as we all know, they never reveal their sources.

       Just look at his Twitter dude. When was the last time he was critical of Putin? This dude kills journalists and jails political opponents and Assange is busy tweeting about Hillary. You'd think a "truth seeker" like Assange would have problems with that. But nope. He's on there retweeting stories from Russian state propaganda.

       You're deluded if you think not attacking Putin (which he has in fact done several times) is a falsehood he is perpetuating. Face it, you've been lied to by the mainstream media. You haven't been lied to once by Wikileaks. At least you are in the right place to find this out.

       So you think eroding our European relationships with these 'Russia sanctions' is a good play? Especially when there is no concrete proof the Russians were involved as there have been intelligence tools which leave Russian 'fingerprints' already leaked to us?
      </p>
      <p>
       There has to be a smoking gun before you can go all in. There is no smoking gun, even on Russia hacking fronts. So what are you referring to with 'evidence' you claim to have?

       The Russian sanctions hurt the EU more than they hurt Russia. Merkel and others warned the US that these sanctions would have consequences if they acted on them, as even they acknowledge this is a witch hunt with no proof. Go look it up - they will be pissed and it doesn't help any of us. We are now blaming our friends for our own problems.

       That's your opinion - I haven't seen him necessarily go that way. He can't just propose a new health care system on his own - in fact, Trump was pissed when the republicans refused to put something together when this was all being hashed out. That's why nothing major ended up changing on the Health care front - Obamacare has not been scaled back at all to this point. The rhetoric doesn't always match the record.

       he's one person and not skilled in writing legislature... this isn't usually done by one person, let alone the president, so I don't know where you are getting that to hold relative to this situation.
      </p>
      <p>
       The president is nothing more than an agreeing figurehead. He can't do much without the rest of government supporting him, so to act like he's some fascist dictator is not genuine.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is the job of congress to propose the health care bill - not the president. It's best when the sponsored bill is given the president's backing and often the president will present it to show it support, but if Congress refuses to do their job there isn't much Trump can do (and for it, healthcare wasn't really changed all that much, so you should be happy).

       He's not skilled in writing legislature because be doesn't know anything about law. He's not a lawyer. Obama introduced his own plan because he is a lawyer and knows how to write that stuff. I never said Trump was a dictator. I'm glad obamacare hasn't been repealed because I'm on it and I pay 40 bucks a month for good healthcare. I hope they don't repeal it. Presidents in the past definitely propose their own bills. The only reason Trump doesn't is because be doesn't know the first thing about writing a bill. He only knows how to boss people around.

       Obama didn't actually write the health care bill. Neither did Bush before him. Or Clinton. They have legislators and lawyers who specialize in this kind of stuff and the leadership reads and approves - they don't write. It's too big a job - the president is a very busy person with all of their public and foreign duties.

       It's even worse because Trump has no idea what's even going on with the bill. He called it mean a month ago. So now he's begging the Congress to pass this mean bill.

       That's a link to the DNI report on what Russia tried to do. I've read it a couple times. To say Russia "didn't intervene" is a pretty gross mischaracterization. While the report does say
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        We did not make an assessment of the impact that Russian activities had on the outcome of the 2016 election. The US Intelligence Community is charged with monitoring and assessing the intentions, capabilities, and actions of foreign actors; it does not analyze US political processes or US public opinion.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       as this is being handled separately by the current FBI, SIC, HIC, and Special Prosecutor investigations, the DNI report also goes on to say
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Russian efforts to influence the 2016 US presidential election represent the most recent expression of Moscow’s longstanding desire to undermine the US-led liberal democratic order, but these
activities demonstrated a significant escalation in directness, level of activity, and scope of effort compared to previous operations.
We assess Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered an influence campaign in 2016 aimed at the US presidential election. Russia’s goals were to undermine public faith in the US democratic process,
denigrate Secretary Clinton, and harm her electability and potential presidency. We further assess Putin and the Russian Government developed a clear preference for President-elect Trump. We
have high confidence in these judgments. We also assess Putin and the Russian Government aspired to help President-elect Trump’s
election chances when possible by discrediting Secretary Clinton and publicly contrasting her unfavorably to him. All three agencies agree with this judgment. CIA and FBI have high confidence
in this judgment; NSA has moderate confidence
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       as well as
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Russia’s intelligence services conducted cyber operations against targets associated with the 2016 US presidential election, including targets associated with both major US political parties.
       </p>
       <p>
        Russian intelligence accessed elements of multiple state or local electoral boards. Since early 2014, Russian intelligence has
researched US electoral processes and related technology and equipment.
       </p>
       <p>
        We assess Moscow will apply lessons learned from its campaign aimed at the US presidential election to future influence efforts in the United States and worldwide, including against US allies and their election processes. We assess the Russian intelligence services would have seen their election influence campaign as at least a qualified success because of their perceived ability to impact public
discussion

       Proof of what? Both republicans and democrats all know Russia hacked the DNC. They are investigating whether or not they made some sort of deal, whether financial or an exchange of favors. We will know when they conclude the investigation. That's if Trump stops being a whiny bitch and firing everyone who's investigating him.

       The same CIA that hacked the Senate and kidnapped people in Western nations and tortured them (or sent them to be tortured by foreign intelligence agencies, like Egypt). That CIA? Or are you talking about some other CIA? Why should I trust the CIA again when the routinely break the US and international law? Especially anonymous CIA source.

       Right, that secret evidence that no one has seen or talked about. Come on now, with all the anonymous sources being used every single day, if anyone had anything close to actual proof it would be shouted from the roof tops of cnn. You might as well believe in the tooth fairy if you're going to assume that some thing happened based on secret evidence that no one has even talked about

       Its not illegal to donate to a former presidents foundation. Is it unethical? Yeah probably. Just depends on who's standard ethics your using. Trump has plenty of ethical issues of his own.

       If Hillary Clinton did something illegal then they can throw her in jail for all I care. I voted for her in 2016 but she's hardly my queen. I would never call someone my queen or something even worse like God Emperor.

       There's is plenty of actual evidence that she in fact did so. If you would listen to the informed opinions of almost anyone who has TS clearance (who isn't in or seeking office), you would realize that you voted for a criminal. I didn't. I didn't vote for a buffoon either. But, most if not all of these Russia accusations are just a pack of lies meant to destroy his legitimacy as the elected President. It is the praetorian guard (CIA, etc) trying to take out a sitting President through character assassination. What troubles me is that we are witnessing a coup attempt, and people like yourself evangelize and defend the lies that are part of this coup.

       It's all anonymous or the repetition of anonymously sourced "facts." As for actual evidence to buttress those facts? We have a report by CrowdStrike that has been debunked by multiple parties and Trump Jr. email chain, which proved that he had a meeting with a Russian lawyer who most likely lied about having info on Hillary so she could get facetime to discuss her adoption bullshit. So far, no one has been arrested, unlike the Awan, where evidence was provided in court by an FBI special agent. Interestingly, both sets of investigations have been occurring just as long.

       I'm glad Awan got caught. You said the investigations have been going on the same length of time. I never once day around yelling "BUT WHERE IS THE EVIDENCE!?" while Awan was being investigated. You shouldn't either for the Trump investigation. Just let it play out. If he's innocent, we will all find out when it's over.

       The relevant post was downvoted to oblivion and any subsequent attempts to post by other users will be removed by the mods because "duplicates." The average user will never see it. This is consistently done to every post that counters the chosen narrative on
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics
       </a>
       .
      </p>

       I know you're playing dumb, but in the off chance that you aren't, a post simply existing somewhere on the board is not what OP was talking about.

       I read your points and you did a good job explaining it. OP still either didn't search or is just wanting to push a narrative. If the title had said "I couldn't any posts on the front page of r/politics about...". But that's not a sensationalist enough of a title to get some upvotes.

       Yup, the takeover happened about halfway through the primaries. There were lots of pro-Bernie posts there, then suddenly you saw obvious shilling and vote bots being used. It was like night and day.

       The pro-Bernie posts stopped when Hillary won the primary because there was no point anymore.  The switch turned to being very pro-Hillary and anti-Trump because the sub is very pro-Democrat.

       So why did all the shills go silent on the 9/11 weekend when Hillary collapsed? Seriously, politics awas back to being exactly like it was before the hillbots for a day or so, then right back to the shilling. Almost as if they were told to stay silent until a narrative was fabricated.

       I honestly don't even know what you're trying to ask me.  I made a point that the sub is incredibly left leaning and pro-Democrat, meaning that when Bernie lost the primary it switched over to being pro-Hillary.  If anything, the attention paid to Bernie by the sub kept Bernie supporters there while the sub switched to being pro-Hillary, to keep them voting Democrat.

       No, there were people who really liked Bernie and actually supported him who voted for Trump because he was closer to what they wanted than Hillary.  They were actual Bernie supporters and they actually voted for the current President of the United States, regardless of how much you want to play No True Scotsman.

       Yeah and those people werent proper supporters they were obviously not voting based on any sane things such as policy but a bizzare popularity contest based on whos totally an "outsider" while ignoring the fact that trump pretty much is a caricature of the global elite.

       Response rate effect. The same reason presidential candidates get a polling bump after the party nominates them at the National Convention. You think some substantial percentage of people are really like, "Oh wow, Donald Trump gave a speech, now I want to vote for him. Oh shit, now Hillary Clinton gave a speech, I had no idea she could do that too! Now I want to vote for her!" The convention just gets people fired up for their candidate, and more likely to respond to polls.
      </p>
      <p>
       The same effect happens when some embarrassing news about a candidate comes out. Response rate from that candidate's supporters goes down even if nobody actually changes their mind.
      </p>
      <p>
       What you describe as evidence of "shilling" is just... normal human behaviour.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can see the same thing in how
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics
       </a>
       switched from being strongly anti-Hillary (and pro-Bernie) to being strongly pro-Hillary. All the anti-Clinton Bernie supporters got demoralised by their candidate's impending loss and stopped contributing so much because of it. Meanwhile, the Clinton fans got more excited and more willing to contribute since it was all good news for their candidate.

       That's what I saw.  The machine behind the constant pro-Democrat push on that sub switched over when Bernie wasn't going to win.  There were anti-Hillary articles from Fox News hitting the front page, then they faded quickly.  I'm guessing there's probably archives and such you could find that track front pages of subs over time, if you really care that much about the timeline.  Still, there was shilling and vote manipulation on that sub a lot longer than starting at halfway through the primaries.

       Yeah the only problem is that all of these people saying it was Russia don't actually have any proof that Russia did anything. The Russians allegedly hacked the dnc, yet they refuse to allow any intelligence agency to inspect their network. Fyi, I'm not a trump supporter, I voted for Bernie and Jill Stein, but good job making yourself look like a fool by making baseless assumptions

       Proof of what? Both republicans and democrats all know Russia hacked the DNC. They are investigating whether or not they made some sort of deal, whether financial or an exchange of favors. We will know when they conclude the investigation. That's if Trump stops being a whiny bitch and firing everyone who's investigating him.

       i can't know that. there's a lot of countries in europe. and arguing for entrenched corruption isn't my thing anyways. Trump is an outsider.

       The same CIA that hacked the Senate and kidnapped people in Western nations and tortured them (or sent them to be tortured by foreign intelligence agencies, like Egypt). That CIA? Or are you talking about some other CIA? Why should I trust the CIA again when the routinely break the US and international law? Especially anonymous CIA source.

       I was talking about the fact that Russia hacked the DNC. I never said the CIA has evidence that Trump and Russia colluded.

       It's even worse because Trump has no idea what's even going on with the bill. He called it mean a month ago. So now he's begging the Congress to pass this mean bill.
