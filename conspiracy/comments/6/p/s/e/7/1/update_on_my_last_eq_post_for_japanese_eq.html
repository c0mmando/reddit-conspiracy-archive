Solar winds now deflating rapidly. Bz component is opened up pretty wide with a long duration event as expected. Today is day 5 of the initial 5 day warning... </p>

<p>I worded it wrong, making it appear as a 2 day or 48 hr warning. <strong>its always been a five day warning</strong> I merely meant that had the event happened within the first 48 hours that it would be in that intensity scale. </p>

<p>What threw me off is that the <a href="http://www.solarham.net/latest_imagery/211b.htm">aia211b</a> data was offset. Making a coronal hole pattern appear farther along the suns lens, then its actual lens phase / positioning. (I dont use noaa predictive data). So my assessment was effected by this glitch. </p>

<p><strong>Since 8.0 was the initial spectrum I&#39;d assess lowered activity. Likely 7.0 range in namie prefecture</strong>. A 5.9 in naze and 5.6 off shore ne of namie has already occured in this cycle. </p>

<p><strong>Area of impact thought to be namie japan. 7.0+/- magnitude...</strong></p>

<p><em>Although this is also still a mild warning from my initial assessment found here:</em> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6okogt/potential_eq_warning_minimal_warning_maximum/">post</a></p>

<p>Still hoping to see a sizeable quake as the winds calm more. (which should be expected based on the spotless lens). There are also no more coronal holes present which will greatly reduce complications in the test. 
So still a mild warning- With prolonged status meaning the intensity will be more so 7.2- range in magnitude then the initial 8.0 assessment. More Time = Less Intensity in incidents. </p>

<p>Hoping to see a sizeable event within 24 maybe 48hrs tops from time of posting this update... The event will be ultimately determined by the Bz re zipping itself and as planetary solar wind speeds continue to recede...</p>

<p>Just an update. </p>

<p>Also I dropped the crowd source campaign- 
So were not fast tracking this anymore...</p>

<p>Kk a lil miffed today. Just updating what I expect to see here unfolding soon. </p>

SUNSPOT RESURRECTED: Old and decaying sunspot 1035, declared to be &quot;a corpse&quot; just yesterday, is showing signs of renewed life. Pete Lawrence sends this picture from his backyard observatory in Selsey, UK:
1/09/2010 <a href="http://www.spaceweather.com/archive.php?view=1&amp;amp;day=09&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;year=2010">http://www.spaceweather.com/archive.php?view=1&amp;amp;day=09&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;year=2010</a> SOLAR ACTIVITY: Today has brought an uptick in solar activity. Sunspot 1040 (a.k.a. old sunspot 1035) is crackling with minor solar flares and seems to be gathering itself for something more. Just hours ago, the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory captured this C1-class eruption:
￼
Backyard astronomers with solar telescopes are encouraged to monitor developments.
a movie: &quot;The plasma crawling around inside AR1040 made me think of the head of Medusa. It was exciting to watch!&quot; says amateur astronomer Michael Buxton of Ocean Beach, California. &quot;I made this time-lapse movie at 1 minute intervals from 2045-2215 UT on 8 Jan. 2010.&quot;
￼
&quot;A welcome view of the sun on a cold January day reveals the remains of AR11035 still alive and kicking,&quot; says Lawrence.
Beneath the waving filaments and bright magnetic froth (&quot;plage&quot;), a dark core is coelescing in the heart of the active region. That makes it a genuine sunspot again. NOAA has re-numbered the region &quot;1040,&quot; but we will continue to refer to it by its original name, &quot;1035.&quot; It is, after all, an old friend.
1/10/2010 <a href="http://www.spaceweather.com/archive.php?view=1&amp;amp;day=10&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;year=2010">http://www.spaceweather.com/archive.php?view=1&amp;amp;day=10&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;year=2010</a> BIG SUNSPOT: Sunspot 1040 (a.k.a. old sunspot 1035) is growing again and is now at least four times wider than planet Earth. A blink comparison of SOHO images shows how the sunspot has expanded in the past 24 hours:
￼
Backyard astronomers with solar telescopes are encouraged to monitor developments.
1/11/2010 <a href="http://www.spaceweather.com/archive.php?view=1&amp;amp;day=11&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;year=2010">http://www.spaceweather.com/archive.php?view=1&amp;amp;day=11&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;year=2010</a> BIG SUNSPOT: Sunspot 1040 is busy growing again. In only 24 hours, it has expanded from a barely visible &quot;sun-speck&quot; to a planet-sized active region with 15 dark cores and a tangled magnetic field. Steve Riegel sends this picture from his backyard observatory in Santa Maria, California:
￼
&quot;On Sunday, the clouds opened up for some fantastic viewing,&quot; says Riegel. &quot;I photographed the active region using a Lunt 60 solar telescope.&quot;
Sunspot 1040 is a member of new Solar Cycle 24. Its appearance continues a recent trend of intensifying solar activity. NOAA forecasters estimate a 10% chance of M- class solar flares during the next 24 hours. Stay tuned.
1/12/2012 <a href="http://www.spaceweather.com/archive.php?view=1&amp;amp;day=12&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;year=2010">http://www.spaceweather.com/archive.php?view=1&amp;amp;day=12&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;year=2010</a>
ACTIVE SUNSPOT: Sunspot 1040 is still growing. During the past two days it has doubled in size--and then doubled again--to produce an active region with more than 25 dark cores and a tangled magnetic field. Dennis Simmons sends this picture of the behemoth from Brisbane, Australia:
￼
&quot;Sweltering under the Australian sun at over 31o C, I had to wipe the perspiration from my eyes while attempting to obtain sharp focus through Earth&#39;s shimmering atmosphere,&quot; says Simmons. &quot;It didn’t help that I had my head under a blanket to block out the bright sunlight that was washing out the display on my Notebook computer! In the end, technology and software allowed me to obtain some reasonable results. It is an impressive sunspot.&quot;
Sunspot 1040 is a member of new Solar Cycle 24, and its appearance continues a recent trend of intensifying solar activity. NOAA forecasters say there is a 15% chance of an isolated M-class solar flare during the next 24 hours. Readers with solar telescopes should be alert for eruptions.
Solar winds began at a low 291km/s on the 08th. From beginning minima calm. New sunspot introduced to lens emitting gamma / beta M class activity. Most active the 09th. Average time to eartg 1-3 days.
Could likely have lead to a sizeable quake. (imo). Wind speeds doubled by the 11th. At 490km/s.
Unaware of coronal holes via solarham archive. Although this ch was spotted on the 01st of January 2010
Which was likely geoactive on the 10th. Being the sunspot was behind the CH. Which likely lead to increased geo magnetic storm levels. Prior to the forthcoming Sunspot.
So both coronal holes and sunspots were geo active on tge lens. My guess is this was at the very beginning of cycle 24. Post minima. Which increased the general threat from solar upticks.
Thats my 2 cents</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Typically no. </p>

<p>However if earth is at a constant calm with a clear lens for a long enough time period; smaller instances appear to hold a more hardened affect in terms of seismic intensity. </p>

<p>I&#39;d argue the events to be dictated by solar interaction yes. 
This was a mild case event. Yet the stagnant behaviour lead to that traditional mild weather to appear moderate by comparison. </p>

<p>So if you asked me: Its untypical to a constant cycle but typical of solar to seismic cycles. Via the differences in solar minima vs. Solar maxima </p>

This was my &quot;prediction&quot; and would you look at it i was 100% right. Well at least according to the criteria of this subreddit for him.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So your argument is that my model using a statistical algorithm with a pitch identifier such as solar intrusions isnt relevant because seismic events are merely &#39;statistically predictable&#39;. So we shouldn&#39;t check the bz componet feed in a comparitive model? </p>

<p>So basically: <em>I cant predict my earthquakes statistically, but you can?</em> and identifying an alternative system to help gauge that is not worthwhile? </p>

<p>Why?</p>

<p>That is all you should say. </p>

<p>And i can&#39;t predict earthquakes. I just look at the most active zones guess there might be an earthquake in a huge amount of time. I guess! Just like you do. Statistically speaking i should be correct a lot of the times. I have demonstrated this. </p>

<p>As i said you have not predicted a single outlier. When you predict an outlier with more precise time and not an area of Japan, Chile....with another 1500 miles added to this already huge area then i might believe you. Until then you are a scammer who just wants peoples money.</p>

<p>And questioned the statistical significance of his data at which point he promptly started saying he has a hard life and does all this from a mobile phone that&#39;s why he needs a house in Oregon. As another poster said, sketchy. </p>
