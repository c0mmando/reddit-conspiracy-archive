<p>The guy has installed his children in the WH, and spends millions of taxpayer $ holidaying at his own resorts. Literally lining his and his family&#39;s pockets with your money - this ignoring the myriad potentials for conflict of interest created by the laughably worthless &#39;divestment&#39; of their personal business empires.</p>

<p>Any one of these issues would be career-ending for any politician in a sane democracy. This is a guy who used his charity to pay the $7 for Don jr. to enroll in the Scouts back in the day... something tells me we haven&#39;t even begun to scratch the surface.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A huge shortage of oil in the world now. All miners increase drilling and can not satisfy the market. Europe will not do without Russian oil. Therefore, an oil embargo for Russia is impossible now. No way. LOL.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Without real sanctions, an oil embargo, Russia greatly increased oil exports during the three years of the war in Ukraine and three years of &quot;sanctions&quot;</p>

<p>Work for Russian drillers but not American. America first. LOL.
лњла, Total, Statoil, Chevron, Tillerson&#39;s ExxonMobil just gave their market share and their profits to the Russians!
But no world about oil embargo for Russia from ANY american politics.</p>

<p>Explain these!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The sanctions I believe were initially being executed as Executive Orders. This legislation makes them laws now, not just EOs. This was done in response to the Russia-Ukraine conflict as well as Russian election meddling. They also made it difficult for Trump(or POTUS in general) do do anything about lifting the sanctions instead leaving that responsibility to a different branch of the Gov. North Korea and Iran were also sanctioned.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Executive Order 13660</strong>, signed on March 6, 2014, authorizes sanctions on individuals and entities responsible for violating the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine, or for stealing the assets of the Ukrainian people. These sanctions put in place restrictions on the travel of certain individuals and officials and showed our continued efforts to impose a cost on Russia and those responsible for the situation in Crimea.</p>

<p><strong>Executive Order 13661</strong>, issued on March 17, 2014, under the national emergency with respect to Ukraine that find that the actions and policies of the Russian government with respect to Ukraine -РђЊ including through the deployment of Russian military forces in the Crimea region of Ukraine РђЊ- undermine democratic processes and institutions in Ukraine; threaten its peace, security, stability, sovereignty, and territorial integrity; and contribute to the misappropriation of its assets.</p>

<p>A new <strong>Executive Order, &quot;Blocking Property of Additional Persons Contributing to the Situation in Ukraine,&quot;</strong> issued on March 20, 2014, expanded the scope of the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13660 of March 6, 2014, and expanded by Executive Order 13661 of March 16, 2014, finding that the actions and policies of the Government of the Russian Federation, including its purported annexation of Crimea and its use of force in Ukraine, continue to undermine democratic processes and institutions in Ukraine; threaten its peace, security, stability, sovereignty, and territorial integrity; and contribute to the misappropriation of its assets, and thereby constitute an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States.</p>

<p><strong>Executive Order 13685</strong> was also issued. Utilizing these Executive Orders, the United States has steadily increased the diplomatic and financial costs of RussiaРђЎs aggressive actions towards Ukraine. We have designated a number of Russian and Ukrainian entities, including 14 defense companies and individuals in PutinРђЎs inner circle, as well as imposed targeted sanctions limiting certain financing to six of RussiaРђЎs largest banks and four energy companies. We have also suspended credit finance that encourages exports to Russia and financing for economic development projects in Russia, and are now prohibiting the provision, exportation, or reexportation of goods, services (not including financial services), or technology in support of exploration or production for deepwater, Arctic offshore, or shale projects that have the potential to produce oil in the Russian Federation, or in maritime area claimed by the Russian Federation and extending from its territory, and that involve five major Russian energy companies.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This one isn&#39;t as clear cut either, I&#39;m not sure if you remember the pictures of troops in Russian uniforms with Russian gear but no insignia. Many outlets claimed this happened, Russia denied it.  Depending on who you believe decides your perspective. Russia officially sent troops right after the referendum, occupying military bases, airports, and local government for a &quot;peaceful transition&quot;. This part was done in public eyes.</p>

<p>The most interesting caveat of the Ukrainiane business( and Russian previous involvement in destabilizing Georgia(The country south of it, done to block a pipeline being made there to bypass Russia to Asia) is the contention of what I consider the border freeze.</p>

<p>Prior to the World Wars, war was actually common even in Europe. Borders continually shifted because of this. A side effect of the U.S. coming to power was a freeze there(This freeze was beneficial to some and crap to others). A grab by a power like Russia would be common back the , now it&#39;s a contentious issue. This has other effects like China and Taiwan.</p>

<p>Personal opinnion I don&#39;t want to return to a world of shifting borders, so I&#39;m heavily against Russia stretching its muscles testing this once a decade.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>With the single caveat that it is wrong (and it was mentioned here often..) </p>

<p>Long story short: The orange revolution saw the fall of Kuchma (pro russia &amp; mostly because of corruption and massive fraud) and the rise of a mixture of pro-western politicians (yushchenko) as well as oligarchs (Tymoshenko). Due to ongoing corruption as well as a energy-powerplan from russia (Ukraine always got cheaper gas from russia, russia used this for political pressure) Tymoshenko was already less than liked whenit came to the 2010 election. So when it came to the vote between the old Kuchma man Yanukovych and Tymoshenko people choose the corruption less public in the 5 years before (and Yanukovych had a strong base in the russian speaking east of the country). </p>

<p>Fast forward 3 years and it becomes clear that a) Yanukovych ist just as corrupt as Tymoshenko and b) Yanukovych is trying to move again away from Europe and back towards Russia. We see <em>another</em> revolution but this time a bloody one. Country is moving towards a civil war when Yanukovych decides to move east and then out of the country. </p>

<p>Now three things happened: a) This time around people died and a lot more of rather extreme nationalists were in play, b) people were already weary with &quot;both&quot; sides  and c) Russia decided not to risk its naval base and annexed crimea (roughly a month after yanukovych was removed from office).</p>

<p>While it is near impossible to disprove the &quot;CIA did it&quot; argument teh revolution probably would have happend anyway and even if only for two reasons: </p>

<p>a) the oligarchs of the western part of the country had troubles finding nice aggrements with the oligarchs of the eastern part of the country </p>

<p>and </p>

<p>b) the young people in the western part of the country are EU and not Russia oriented..</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, I hear what you wrote (the very concise + clear write up regarding what happened btw. Thanks), and I tend to agree with the most part.</p>

<p>One part that I feel icky with (?) - not disagreeing with, just feel uncomfortable with - is Рђюwould have happened anyway.РђЮ Yes, it would have happened anyway, but did it have to be that brutal one? To what end? With that much of blood spilt, wouldnРђЎt Ukraine people have picked/demanded one thatРђЎs decently for his own people? To me, thatРђЎs the sign of money. </p>

<p>Brewing orchestrated radical civil unrest requires united efforts Рђћ I would say professional efforts. IРђЎm not saying I can prove it was not an organic one. All I am saying is that throughout history, when thereРђЎs an uncharacteristic bloody civil turmoil, itРђЎs been proven that thereРђЎs an always hidden power/hand working its own agenda. With Ukraine, I believe, NED (CIA) saw the opportunity and seized it. At the cost of good hard working Ukraine peopleРђЎs blood.</p>

<p>The US has not dared to introduce an oil embargo against Russia. And it did not dare to give the Ukrainians weapons, although the US took nuclear weapons from the Ukrainians in return for guarantees of sovereignty.</p>

<p>Worse and False than Russia Only the US.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>OP, don&#39;t be too worried about buying oil and gas from the U.S. That was a hoax in 2014 and it&#39;s a hoax now. &quot;We&quot; don&#39;t have a fraction of the pipeline, LNG plants or fleets of ships necessary to actually make up for what Europe gets from Russia.</p>

<p>The real supply is, as always, in the Mideast; so pay attention to OPEC, pipelines, Syria, Israel, etc.</p>
