    <div class="md"><p>This place runs the gamut first of all. Second of all, the reason the awan story is all over this sub and also is a republican talking point is the fact that the conspiracy is in the fact that the main stream media recklessly ignored the story since February thereby drawing attention to it from those of us who enjoy ton foil head coverings. The 80s moral panic stuff?  Not sure what you are referring to?  The multiple threads on the transgender stuff?  Are you aware Canada may make it legal for the state to  take your child if you do not raise them as the gender they tell you they are?  That&#39;s a pretty big fucking deal.</p>

<p>There are as many right wing attack type stories on this sub too. There are political point scorers on literally every subtedfit because they are literally paid to be there. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just lightheartedly injecting some local Australian flavour. Basically bunyips are an Australian cryptozoological creature that apparently live in billabongs (watering holes), and are known to produce overwhelming dread in those who see them. Think one part sasquatch, one part wendigo, one part psychic shapeshifter, but with an Indigenous Australian flavour.</p>

<p>What&#39;s interesting is that there are high profile people (Members of Parliament etc) who will swear black and blue to having seen bunyips. </p>

<p>I wasn&#39;t actually expecting to see any discussion of them here (I kind of mentioned them in jest), but Australian crypto stuff is actually super interesting (we have the same land mass as the USA but 1/12th of the population, so there&#39;s a lot of unpopulated parts of the country, and even our uncontroversially-accepted flora and fauna is pretty weird). Maybe I should practice what I preach and dig some of the theories up?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s a surprising amount of people that don&#39;t realize that when a republican says &quot;small government&quot;, they really mean &quot;big corporations&quot; (especially the MIC). I can see why conspiracy theorists might be attracted to that school of thought at least on its propaganda level, but if people truly want to think freely, you really need to abandon partisanship at the door. Maybe be the voice of reason and counter partisan bullshit and help them see the conspiracy beyond that? This sub needs more of that to balance t_d influence, but it also does not need the same thing in the other direction. Both sides likely have the same masters.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s a war for our minds. Some is disinfo and some is genuine. You should approach each with an open mind, apply skepticism to both sides of any topic, and then see where you end up.</p>

<p>Once you have educated yourself on a topic and developed your own opinion, bring it here and test it out. Test our opinions out as well.</p>

<p>I tend to think there&#39;s a third side to every story. I think you&#39;ll find many here that believe there is no right/left aside from the facade used to manipulate the general public. Following that line of thought there is no need to subscribe to any hard line, emotionally driven, partisan belief systems.</p>

<p>Take Trump for example. Trump/Russia ties are probably true to some degree. He has a Russian wife ffs. Of course he knows Russians. Is he directly tied to the Russian state or kgb? I dunno, but I do know that he&#39;s directly tied to Isreal through Kushner and AIPAC. Why isn&#39;t that the big story? Nobody wants to talk about how fucked it is that the biggest superpac and most prolific donator in US politics is a foreign country. That&#39;s collusion and it can be proven oh so easily. The conspiracy is right out in the open.</p>

<p>Anti-vax: by claiming that this has no critical thinking behind it, you are displaying a lack of critical thought yourself. Lets not even get in to the claims and just talk about this one from a skeptical standpoint, relying on the commonly accepted information. Vaccines do not undergo the same testing processes that other medications are subjected to. There is no way to project long term effects of over-vaccinating an entire population for generations ( mutations, accumulative effects of ingredients, etc.). In no way is this an open and closed topic. </p>

<p>Honestly, you should read as much of everything as possible. Many outright lies hide truths and vice versa. Coming to a place like this with preconceived notions of what you&#39;ll learn isn&#39;t the best way to demonstrate your critical thinking abilities. Lighten up and accept that conspiracy circles consist of a far more varied spectrum of individuals than the traditional echo chambers of typical social media.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Utterly false is your attempt at an assertion. You have been completely dishonest about what is actually contained in a vaccine (which varies dependant on the vaccine being discussed). </p>

<p>Dishonest about the testing practices, which are solely carried out by the manufacturer and don&#39;t include testing against placebo. That is not how medicines are tested.</p>

<p>Dishonest about long term effects. We still don&#39;t definatively know what the long term effects of being constantly surrounded by high voltage electro-magnetic fields will be on the species as a whole... It&#39;s impossible to have this knowledge short of a time machine. </p>

<p>You must know that natural immunity is far superior to innoculation under optimal circumstances, right? The only argument against this is simply that we see more deaths in regards to some diseases when allowing natural immunity to run it&#39;s course. That in no way justifies a 77 vaccine schedule (up from 16 in a little over 30 years) that includes low mortality, treatable diseases. </p>

<p>I am not against vaccines on the whole. There&#39;s a need. What I am against is the corrupt companies that produce them for profit and trick people like you into the full undelayed schedule + regular boosters (which a very high percentage of patients never end up getting anyway, again reducing the chances that they have actually developed any lasting immunity). </p>

<p>All this data and more is (like you said) freely available online, within the webpages of the CDC and medical journals. </p>

<p>Pathogen induced immunity and vaccine induced immunity are basically indistinguishable, except the fact that you may die as a result of an infection. Where do you get that figure of 77 from?

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for including that adjuvants and preservatives in part comprise vaccines. I agree that harmful ingredients should be taken out, and sometimes even are. Thimerosal is a good example of this. It only took until 1999 to determine that mercury exposure was probably unhealthy for infants.</p>

<p>If you fall in to the school of evolutionary thought, then 200 years is a very short amount of time to make any conclusions on long-term, multi-generational effects. </p>

<p>I&#39;m pretty sure that I got the number 77 from the full schedule of vaccine doses and boosters from birth to 18 years including the yearlies like influenza but memory is flawed and I&#39;m at the end of my second week of less than 5 hours of sleep per night so I could be off. I probably should have said &quot;up to 77&quot; as well, since I&#39;m pretty sure different vaccines that address the same pathogens require different dosages.</p>

<p>I agree with you about being exposed and utilizing our bodies natural processes as the vehicle for immunization. I don&#39;t agree that pathogen and vaccine induced immunity are indistinguishable. If that were true then boosters for things like chicken pox which grant a high likelyhood of lifelong immunity wouldn&#39;t be very necessary, would they? </p>

<p>Another current happening that chafes is how the younger generation no longer accepts shedding as a  reality. Doctors used to warn parents about shedding when vaccines were administered but it appears that is no longer the case as I have had to prove that symptoms of shedding are still in the warning labels to actual medical professionals. Why is that? I&#39;ve been told that the thinking is that people didn&#39;t properly understand shedding and so it is mostly ommitted these days but that doesn&#39;t sit well. Misunderstandings aren&#39;t corrected by refusing to have the discussion.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not COMPLETELY anti-vax. I think the truth is (like most stories with 2 sides) somewhere in the middle. It&#39;s just as impossible to fully trust any agency who has material interests in the topic to be 100% factual about the negatives as it is to trust any fantastical or uninformed theories on the same subject. Oil, tobacco, alchohol, anti-marijuana, wireless, and pharmaceutical lobbyists have all proven this time and again. </p>

<p>You have reservations about how vaccines will affect humans over geological time? Does this doubt extend to all interventions in human life? The ill effects of immunization, while uncommon certainly exist and must be avoided. The ill effects are well characterized, despite being rare, because vaccines have been utilized for centuries on hundreds of millions of people (if not more). Vaccines, clean water and sanitation are primarily why humans are so plentiful and healthy.</p>

<p>Are you are saying chickenpox infection induces lifelong immunity? Varicella zoster virus remains in previously infected people for life and often reactivates (shingles).</p>

<p>If your doctor refuses to discuss your concerns, find a different doctor. Shedding rarely happens, no evidence of negative consequences have been recorded and vaccines capable of shedding are not common in pediatric vaccines schedules.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have already expressed concern about high voltage electro-magnetic fields constantly surrounding us, but at the same time I&#39;m typing to you so, yes and no? Do I think it&#39;s healthy? Probably not. Do I think it amplifies chances of cancer? Probably. Am I willing to give it up forever? Absolutely not. Yes, my skepticism extends to most modern industries with material interests. The sheer greed displayed at the highest levels of industry is reason enough to be highly skeptical. It&#39;s not that I think everybody is in on it either, I just think that self preservation and at the higher levels, greed decides best practices regardless of reality.</p>

<p>I&#39;m aware of how shingles occur. Don&#39;t they occur in vaccinated individuals too? What I&#39;m trying to illustrate is this:</p>

<p>Are chances of catching chicken pox after being vaccinated once for it higher than chances of catching chicken pox after gaining natural immunity? Boosters are there to pick up the slack in case one didn&#39;t gain immunity or to bolster in later years when immunity is likely to have weakened or left cell memory. </p>
