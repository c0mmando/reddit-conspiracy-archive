    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s different than that. The left has been focusing on social justice issues, and it hasn&#39;t been winning them any elections. This week, the dems released their new &quot;better deal&quot; &quot;better wages&quot; economic focus and to hopefully step away from social issues a little. This move puts the dems right back in their corner, forcing them to take the side of social justice. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is a very good point.  I wonder if trump I&#39;d trying to force them to go back to the losing identity politics strategy.  If so, I think it&#39;s a little early to make that play, it&#39;s still over a year away from any election.  Although it could be so that the idea marinates In the dems minds so that it throws them off track earlier?  Who knows?  Not me!!!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yup... I think it can only serve to divide the Democratic base... or turn folks away from that party. But the Trump people will remain unaffected... cause in the end it really is a fairly unimportant decision from a logical and statistical standpoint... but is packs a whole load of emotional weight for those opposed to Trump... and emotional outbursts tend to be very unbecoming. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with that too. I&#39;ve been following this and from the military standpoint it did more harm than good. The whole point of the military is to win wars when ordered to. </p>

<p>They still use community showers divided by male/female. The decision was made to have transitioning men to shower with women even though they still have their dicks. And this copy pasta from an earlier comment-</p>

<p>The whole thing was a weird social experiment, maybe to normalize it.</p>

<p>Anyone could join then demand a sex change and the military had to oblige and pay for it. That put them on at least four years of nondeployable status and in that time their contract would end. It was basicly a way to give out free sex change operation/therapy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is less about Trump and more of a reflection on how inept, disingenuous , and shallow the D party is. They are so predictably self mutilating, terrible group of psychopaths, most of whom never held a real job. The true liberalists of the party need to splinter off and regroup ASAP. So the the civic nationalist/ populist/ libertarian Republican majority. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m a critic of Trump and this decision, but I don&#39;t think the timing was meant to be a distraction. Apparently <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2017/07/26/trump-announces-ban-on-transgender-people-in-u-s-military/?utm_term=.6ea50177ed62">tomorrow</a> was the &quot;deadline for the military to update its medical standards to accommodate transgender service members.&quot; Delaying would have greatly increased the all-in costs of implementing the ban.</p>

<p>On the other side of the question, it&#39;s true that delaying as long as they did might have been intentional; after all, that delay also had costs. (Surely the DOD has already drafted the regs it was required to produce by tomorrow.) But I think Hanlon&#39;s Razor fits here. I think it&#39;s much more likely that the administration just dragged its feet through inertia rather than strategically postponing an announcement that really won&#39;t distract very much from the scandals the administration cranks out every week.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe it is its own agenda and a component of Cultural Marxism. It&#39;s the continuation of degrading the moral fabric and natural structure of society. It&#39;s more division and the confusion of the natural roles and instincts of the male and female identity. </p>

<p>Men and women have never been more unhappier than these times we live in. Feminism want emasculated men to make them feel more powerful, but in the end women are miserable because instinctually they desire strong masculine males...men are miserable because being emasculated, feminized or dominated by a woman who feels she must be the man is a living hell on earth.</p>

<p>I can only speak for the US...we are losing the know how and the testosterone driven thinking that it takes to have a strong country...they are literally forgetting how to build infrastructure. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m pretty much convinced at this point that American Politics is a controlled shitshow. </p>

<p>Both Trump &amp; Clinton were chosen because they&#39;re polarizing assholes. The way Americans have been shaped over the last 25 years is into team A vs team B and Americans have been trained to pick a side.</p>

<p>Bringing up the transgender issue is obviously a distraction, but it&#39;s meant to make Americans on both sides fight about completely useless bullshit that doesn&#39;t affect like 99% of the population. The focus on gay rights, black rights, women&#39;s rights, etc is ideological manipulation to keep Americans divided by superficial issues.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the corporate leaders get whatever the hell they want and the US public gets fucked over.</p>
