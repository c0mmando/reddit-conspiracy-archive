       PresidentJamesComey was the user banned yesterday, I forgot who the other one was a few months ago but it sticks out because the day before the moderator claimed they don't ban shills because they can't identify them, then banned someone for shilling.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can check the mod log for yesterday, none of his comments had broken any rules until after he was banned and started attacking the moderator due to the ridiculousness of it.

       That user deserved a ban even if they weren't a shill. We have many new people who come here and just mock the sub and its discussions. Why should the mods keep them around? Let's say I go to r/nfl and repeatedly claim football is a stupid barbaric sport. Should I start crying if the mods ban me?
      </p>
      <p>
       In short, be respectful to this sub and you'll be treated with respect. If you come in causing trouble, however, then don't be surprised if you're met with contempt. Being a shill or not is irrelevant

       His comments that were deleted and got him banned didn't do that, and that's not the reason given for his ban.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the mods think he should have been banned for that they should have banned him for attacking this sub, not deleted perfectly fine comments and banned him for shilling for pedos.

       Because I can't make that decision if he was here to better the sub or not, the comments that got him banned really weren't disruptive or anything.
      </p>
      <p>
       My main issue is the whole banning for shilling thing as a whole, how can a mod identify them? There is absolutely no way they can positively identify one, and I think they use it to ban people they don't like
      </p>
      <p>
       I bet if they released a list of users banned for shilling they're mostly all users who go against the moderators opinions.

       And that's what I find odd. If you look through presidentjamescomey's history, it should be pretty obvious why they would receive some flak from the mods. That user is even trying to do the same thing over in T_D. Don't stir up trouble if you want to be taken seriously. It's really not hard to grasp, especially considering the climate of this sub recently

       That makes it sound worse, not better. He wasn't banned for trolling, he was banned for shilling, right?
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem with banning people for shilling is that since there's no evidence of it, it makes it hard to distinguish a righteous ban from "mods didn't like him." The fact that no one seems to be able to find anything in his history justifying a ban other than vague "stirring up trouble" makes it sound like we're not on the "righteous ban" end of that spectrum.

       Yep, that's where I saw it, I saw him getting banned and his comments deleted with no reason so I asked him.

      <p>
       The mod said he was banned for "shilling for pedos", reading the comments that he made and had deleted that's some pretty ridiculous reasoning.

       Look, I'm on mobile right now and I don't have the resources to keep going back and fourth with you or the patience.

       We have a public mod log. If there isn't a reason, ask the mod who banned the person. I sure as shit am not going to waste my evening on my cell phone trying to figure this shit out.

       I did and was accused of being that user by
       <a href="/u/Sabremesh">
        /u/Sabremesh
       </a>
       (the mod who banned him), I'd repost but I have a feeling I'll just get a removal + ban this time.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can't get a real answer from you for why it was removed (again, no witch hunt if there aren't witches) and messaging mod mail gets me nowhere. There seems to be no accountability from you guys, and that's an honest criticism not some attack.

        Your unprecedented white knighting for

         /u/PresidentJamesComey
        </a>
        is every bit as obsessive as the drama-edit spree after I banned that account. That is because they are almost certainly both your accounts.

       Great response from

       That would defeat the purpose of deleting my accounts often, but no, I haven't been banned.
