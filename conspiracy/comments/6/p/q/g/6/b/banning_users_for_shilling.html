    <div class="md"><p>That user deserved a ban even if they weren&#39;t a shill. We have many new people who come here and just mock the sub and its discussions. Why should the mods keep them around? Let&#39;s say I go to r/nfl and repeatedly claim football is a stupid barbaric sport. Should I start crying if the mods ban me?</p>

<p>In short, be respectful to this sub and you&#39;ll be treated with respect. If you come in causing trouble, however, then don&#39;t be surprised if you&#39;re met with contempt. Being a shill or not is irrelevant</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because I can&#39;t make that decision if he was here to better the sub or not, the comments that got him banned really weren&#39;t disruptive or anything. </p>

<p>My main issue is the whole banning for shilling thing as a whole, how can a mod identify them? There is absolutely no way they can positively identify one, and I think they use it to ban people they don&#39;t like</p>

<p>I bet if they released a list of users banned for shilling they&#39;re mostly all users who go against the moderators opinions. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>And that&#39;s what I find odd. If you look through presidentjamescomey&#39;s history, it should be pretty obvious why they would receive some flak from the mods. That user is even trying to do the same thing over in T_D. Don&#39;t stir up trouble if you want to be taken seriously.

    <div class="md"><p>That makes it sound worse, not better. He wasn&#39;t banned for trolling, he was banned for shilling, right? </p>

<p>The problem with banning people for shilling is that since there&#39;s no evidence of it, it makes it hard to distinguish a righteous ban from &quot;mods didn&#39;t like him.&quot; The fact that no one seems to be able to find anything in his history justifying a ban other than vague &quot;stirring up trouble&quot; makes it sound like we&#39;re not on the &quot;righteous ban&quot; end of that spectrum.</p>

<p>This would result in witchhunting for both users and mods. It is basically what you were asking for.</p>

<p>We have a public mod log. If there isn&#39;t a reason, ask the mod who banned the person. I sure as shit am not going to waste my evening on my cell phone trying to figure this shit out.</p>

<p>I can&#39;t get a real answer from you for why it was removed (again, no witch hunt if there aren&#39;t witches) and messaging mod mail gets me nowhere. There seems to be no accountability from you guys, and that&#39;s an honest criticism not some attack. </p>
