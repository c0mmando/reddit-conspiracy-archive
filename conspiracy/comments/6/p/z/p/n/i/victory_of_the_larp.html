    <div class="md"><p>But don&#39;t let their bullshit sully the genuinely positive ideas they talked about. VotL is a scam, but he said true things about humanity itself. We are definitely not alone, and since the rest of the universe likely mirrors our society there are going to be good and bad people out there. If we ever do make it to space I hope we can find the good guys. I want to be part of the rebel alliance too.</p>

<p>Also, love and compassion are the keys to ending our current enslavement. The elites hold power by dividing us and making us blame each other. None of us are the reason the rest of us suffer. They are. Love your fellow man (or woman, or tranny) and to hell with the rich!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Rh blood is still a bit mysterious, ever heard how it works?</p>

<p>&quot;The complexity of this blood type gets even more intense when it comes to speculating pregnant women who have it. Women who possess the RH negative blood type and become pregnant can have a lot of difficulty delivering a baby that contains a RH positive blood type.</p>

<p>This means that the mothers body would naturally assault and try to kill the fetus. To make sure that doesn&#39;t happen, they are given a sterilization solution.&quot;</p>

<p>A lot of theories arise from that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>VoTL and COBRA are incredibly deceptive. They prey on what you &#39;want&#39; to hear. They string you along with just enough to keep you interested but never actually deliver with anything concrete. Why can&#39;t they deliver? Because most of what they say is complete BS.</p>

<p>There are no aliens, but there are demons. There is no other hidden galactic races outside the bubble that we live in, but there is an unseen realm where spirits of enormous power &amp; knowledge exist that have been there before the creation of this planet and the human race. They are cunning, deceptive, and incredibly evil. They hate you, everything about you, they want you to die, a horribly death to boot. They will tell you anything your itching ears want to hear just as long as it is as far away from the real Truth as possible. I don&#39;t doubt when they say they have been &#39;in contact&#39; with &#39;alien entities&#39; that they are actually telling the truth in this case. But they are not what they appear to be, or what they say they are. Following these will only lead to your destruction, and by the time you realize it, it will be too late.</p>

<p>If you can believe it, many of the things they say about the coming &#39;disclosure&#39; or the so-called &#39;event&#39; I believe will actually play out in some form or fashion, as LIES and LARPs like this are far more effective when they smother a tiny grain of truth in a steaming pile of cunning lies and deceptive doctrines. If you can fathom it, I think it will even play into the events that the convergence of the signs all point to starting this Fall 2017.</p>

<p>All the lies they are peddling is prophesied in the Bible and it ultimately has to do with the taking up of the Body of Christ (the Church, or rather, true-believers in the Church) and their attempted lame-ass explanation for it (blue-beam, etc). They know it&#39;s coming, and soon. They have been waiting for it, planning for it. They know as soon as the restrainer is removed they have 7 long years to attempt to play &#39;God&#39; and TPTB will usher in their false messiah that they have been grooming for the masses to swallow hook, line &amp; sinker.</p>

<p><strong>Coming soon to a world near you:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>One world government</li>
<li>One world currency</li>
<li>One world (false) religion</li>
<li>A mark that you will not be able to buy or sell without</li>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh I believe every word; or else I wouldn&#39;t say it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>(Jude 1:14-17)</strong> - &quot;Enoch, the seventh from Adam, prophesied about them: “See, the Lord is coming with thousands upon thousands of his holy ones to judge everyone, and to convict all of them of all the ungodly acts they have committed in their ungodliness, and of all the defiant words ungodly sinners have spoken against him.” These people are grumblers and faultfinders; they follow their own evil desires; they boast about themselves and flatter others for their own advantage.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What would you do if you were chicken little, and you knew that no one would possibly believe you? At least not just yet, not until <del>later</del> sooner. In fact you notice that most of them are too distracted arguing amongst themselves about whether or not the Sky is even real! Let alone if it was going to soon fall on them soon ...</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>(2 Peter 3:3-7)</strong> - &quot;Above all, you must understand that in the last days scoffers will come, scoffing and following their own evil desires. They will say, “Where is this ‘coming’ he promised? Ever since our ancestors died, everything goes on as it has since the beginning of creation.” But they deliberately forget that long ago by God’s word the heavens came into being and the earth was formed out of water and by water. By these waters also the world of that time was deluged and destroyed. By the same word the present heavens and earth are reserved for fire, being kept for the day of judgment and destruction of the ungodly.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Are you serious, or a LARPer? Crazy Christians don&#39;t call themselves crazy Christians, until now?</p>

<p>You want to talk about evil, which is simply self-serving behavior even at the expense of others. Let&#39;s talk about dogma. Nothing else has driven consciousness into so much misery, abuse, and confusion.</p>

<p>It&#39;s what gets people to spout scripture as fact. Then they say and do crazy things aligned with that scripture. Someone should show these people how easy and useful it is exploit someone when they believe dogma. </p>

<p>They are convinced believing dogma saves their soul, but I am convinced believing dogma damns their life to suffering, abuse and confusion as well as some of those around them, who don&#39;t have the mental resources to reject the virus. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I care nothing for man-made dogma or religion. I care about a personal relationship with the One True Living God that created everything you see before you. I care about <strong>Truth</strong>, that in this fallen world can only be found in Biblical Scripture, which is the literal Word of God.</p>

<p>I know you won&#39;t believe me now, i know, i&#39;m well aware of this. I hope though that in the future, when the status quo abruptly shifts in just a single day, that you will remember. There&#39;s so much evidence that proves the Bible is true if one is willing to set aside their pre-conceived notions for a moment and research it. Truths such as the prophetic fulfillment of Revelation 12:1-2 on September 23, 2017 could not be possible if the Bible was not the supernatural text that it is.</p>

<p>The supernatural and the spirit realm is also very, <strong>very</strong> <strong>real</strong>. All are going to see this for themselves soon enough. The lies and deception that have indoctrinated all in this world are so incredibly thick, layered and complex that it is impossible to see through it all without the Light guiding you.</p>

<p>It all begins soon, you shouldn&#39;t have to wait that long to understand that i&#39;m not as crazy as my name infers.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dogma is dogma, no matter wherever you think it comes from. It all comes from other beings like you and I, not our legitimate spiritual owners or something like that. You don&#39;t know if was from the creator of the universe or a little schadenfreude sucking dickhead. To believe the unproven claims of perceived authority is to believe dogma. That you are doing, regardless what you call it. Dogma is not required to seek God. It is counterproductive to that end. God will just let the trolls fool you in that case. </p>

<p>I do believe some of the content of what you repeated, but you&#39;ll find the demon in the details. ET beings of many kinds come here. Some of them are the evolved versions of the unscrupulous, sadistic, slave seeking parasitic beings that live here. To call them demons gives them undue fearsomeness from the mystery of dogma. These beings are actually simple and boring after you understand their basic modus operandi. They are just predictable self-serving machines.</p>

<p>Unscrupulous ET visitors taught us some of our religions and corrupted other ones. They corrupted Christianity away from the message of Jesus. It&#39;s not the worship, obedience or faith of Jesus that is important here. Even if you think he didn&#39;t exist or was an awful man, if you truly live your life with respect for other beings, you walk the path he did, whether you believe it or not. That matters, because it helps create life experiences that resemble expectations of heaven. </p>

<p>The unscrupulous, parasitic ETs create experiences that resemble expectations of hell. The beings in a given area give it the atmosphere. A hell without parasites would just be a challenging physical environment.</p>

<p>If you insist upon behaving in ways that you know are out of integrity, that defy known truth, you are choosing to be exploited. Some are going to take advantage of it.</p>

<p>While I can consider ideas and find wisdom in the Bible, or the Koran, or Joe&#39;s Life Lessons or whtever, it doesn&#39;t mean any of these texts came from God or that I should trust them.</p>

<p>You should do yourself a favor and research Mormonism and Scientology. Since they are both so new, their true origins are still recorded well in history. They are jokes against foolish people. It&#39;s sad how willing we are to be fooled.</p>

<p>I want to close by pointing out that it&#39;s OK to believe in God or whatever you want, just arrive there without being manipulated by others, especially taking their words as the literal words of God. Prophecy success is not proof that you must believe someone or God will punish you. Our offworld slave seekers use religious thought and themes as vehicles to gain our consent to their repeated abuses. </p>

<p>They even impersonate angels after you die and every time they do, they sell you that due to your sins, you must pay them back in being set up for suffering. Yet, these being get high off of your suffering and are lying to you about owing them anything. They impersonate God and yes God tolerates it. The God presence we get here is the devil in drag selling unworthiness, subservience and repeated, endless punishment. </p>
