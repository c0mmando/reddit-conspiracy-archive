        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Corruption at the highest level;  almost unbelievable, but not really.</p>

<p>The real heart of the Clintons can be seen here. Liberal Democrats will stand up and defend this..that&#39;s how distorted their thinking has become. The report below is staggering but not surprising considering the source.</p>

<p>These figures are from an official copy of the Bill, Hillary and Chelsea Clinton Foundation for the tax year 2014. The copy of the tax return is from the National Center for Charitable Statistics website! You can get the latest tax return there on any charitable organization! I would venture to say that any legitimate charity would have already been taken into custody by now. But of course this is the Clintons that we&#39;re talking about!</p>

<p>Total revenue (line 12)  $177,804,612.00</p>

<p>Total grants to charity (line 13)  $5,160,385.00  (that&#39;s less than 3%)</p>

<p>Total expenses   $91,281,145.00</p>

<p>Expenses include:
Salaries (line 15)              $34,838,106.00
Fund raising fees (line 16a)       $850,803.00
Other expense (line17)     $50,431,851.00
Travel                                               8,000,000.00
Meetings                          $12,000,000.00</p>

<p>The Clinton Foundation lists 486 employees(line5)!
Imagine this level of corruption: it took 486 people who are paid $34.8 million (an average of $71,604) complete with $91.3 million in fees and expenses, to give away a paltry$5.1 MILLION!</p>

<p>Line 22 show sending year net assets/fund balances of $332,471,349.00 which is up $85,171,891 from last year&#39;s tax return!  And they call this a CHARITY?</p>

<p>This is corruption of the highest magnitude possible. Can you imagine if these thieves had taken the White House? Yet the liberal Democrats criticize President Trump at every possible moment. Such hypocrites!</p>

<p>The Clinton Foundation&#39;s full tax return can be found at <a href="http://990s.foundationcenter">http://990s.foundationcenter</a>. org/990<em>pdf_archive/311/

    <div class="md"><p>This is what big charity is. </p>

<p>You set yourself up with a fancy sounding job, get volunteers to collect the funding and pay yourself a hefty salary cause you&#39;re the boss. </p>

<p>As long as you divert a % of income, you keep the regulators happy and all is good. </p>

<p>Thats simplified down to 1 paid employee but essentially how they all work.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I couldn&#39;t find a 2014 link, but here&#39;s the 2013 990 </p>

<p><a href="http://www.guidestar.org/FinDocuments/2013/311/580/2013-311580204-0b0083da-9.pdf">http://www.guidestar.org/FinDocuments/2013/311/580/2013-311580204-0b0083da-9.pdf</a></p>

<p>OP is a bit misleading though, for instance he calculates salaries from eployees and salaries from programs together. 73% of salaries in 2013 went to people outside the foundation. The foundation employees would average around(give or take some cause it&#39;s a year prior and I can&#39;t find 2014 info) about 27% of what OP listed.</p>

<p>Likewise, in 2013 travel expenses 77% of the cost was for program travel, 23% for its employees.</p>

<p>This brings up another point, the $5 billion to grants is exactly that, only to grants. The Clinton Foundation is an operating foundation, which means it spends money on implementing programs. Grants are given to other initiatives for implementing programs and the grant giving types are called non-operating.</p>

<p>It&#39;s tough to nail how much is spent on charity, I think it&#39;s estimated around 89%. The Clinton Foundation isn&#39;t really for making money, it&#39;s for the connections as programs are implemented internationally, along with prestige and leverage. Think of it as a bargaining chip, they will invest programs in a group for non tangible reciprocation.</p>
