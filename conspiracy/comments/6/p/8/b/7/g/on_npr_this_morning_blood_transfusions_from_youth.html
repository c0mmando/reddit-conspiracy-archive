       Anyone else hear this? Host even made a joke about "we aren't going to have youngsters attached to venture capitalists are we?". I'll find the audio after work if no one else has posted. Good material to send to people who think the whole vampire idea is insane. It's not magic, just biology.

       From listening to it, I think this is the shittiest involved.  They are taking people's money and opening their results to a lot of placebo effect.  Others are doing true studies with control subjects.

       I remember reading about this when it first came out. Disturbingly, they source blood from any blood bank, which means that high schoolers who think they're being good samaritans by donating might just be keeping rich old fuckers alive and well. GRRR...
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The company buys its supply from blood banks, which also sell blood to pharmaceutical companies. So high-schoolers donating their blood are not aware that it might be used on healthy adults.

       My guess is that donated blood only lasts so long, which means that blood banks that have received more donations than necessary are faced with a choice of either throw away excess blood or sell it to pharma companies. I don't really see what's wrong with them selling the extra blood they get.

       I heard about them testing this with rats a couple years ago and seeing success, but I don't see how this makes vampires not magic, the instruments and machines required to do it(and knowledge of blood types even) were not available to 13th century wallachians.

       This is not bloodletting though.  This is blood transfusion.  Blood transfusion is real science.  The Vlad the Impaler/Draclua stories were (likely) stylized recountings of these blood transfusion "ceremonies" the elites have practiced for eons.

       It's a lot worse than blood. Vampires look like shoplifters compared to these spiritual parasites and their masters. They like an energy released by beings in fear and suffering. The more damaging the behavior is to consciousness, the more they get out of it. That's why they love to harm children.
      </p>
      <p>
       These people and their masters are the epitome of useless eaters. They like to call us useless eaters, because they see us as a lazy, increasingly obsolete labor force. Yet, they are feeding on our labor without equal contributions. That's what they like to do as souls to other souls. They are slave seeking parasites, the garbage of God, seriously.
      </p>
      <p>
       They believe in the opposite of the golden rule, which is to treat people the way you would want to be treated. They believe you should serve yourself even at the expense of others. They believe betrayal, subversion, corruption and slavery are good. They believe that the strong should enslave and devour the weak, to produce more robust competitors. This is what the path of the useless eater, spiritual parasite, Satanism, Luciferianism is all about.
      </p>
      <p>
       (No, not the antichristian trolls posing as Satanists, they're not evil, they're good people trying to destroy the mind control systems called religions. They often have better morality than the religious.)
      </p>
      <p>
       Their masters are slaves and so on up their nested, secretive hierarchies. They are all slave seekers and so they are all each other's slaves. They get freedom, but only that which serves or doesn't interfere with their masters. The ultimate owner in this hierarchy is an AI abomination people call the adversary of God. It tricks beings into enslaving others so that they consent to their own slavery. A time after they fully commit to enslave others, the master confronts them with their choice and judges them as a God imposter or another being. They cannot defend their moral inconsistency and believe they deserve to be slaves, even if they don't want to be. Their belief elicits their consent. This is how you become damned, by damning others in the same way. Then you're rhetorically defenseless and spiritual slavery requires beliefs.
      </p>
      <p>
       These beings want to add us to their system, but they nerd us to become enough like them in how we believe. The corrupt elites are already on that page. They hope to trick us into desiring and installing AI into our minds and to have power over our civilization. They plan to hack the AI, in order to hack us. They are all hackers, as hackers seek to infiltrate, undermine, insert deceptive signals, and utilize others' stuff. They do this with technology, life and souls, because they are unscrupulous self-serving trash. They all are infested with the AI constantly giving them suggestions on how to think and control others. We also have the AI inside us, but more limited. Since we don't agree with it yet, it tempts us to become like it. It sends thoughts as if they are our own, are from trusted parties, even angels or God. You have to know them by the fruit their behavior bears, which is negative emotional states. They feed on them like crackheads. They'll seek to put you into those states and keep you there using any theme that works, especially the light. They love to destroy truth and trust in good things.
      </p>
      <p>
       When the light comes, be sure to ask them why God wants us to suffer by behaving as though we have AIDS. The false light is the good cop of the dark. It teaches us to allow the dark to farm this emotional energy and corrupt young races. It's there to give the illusion of choice and render resistance impotent.

       I mean the description of the mouse experimentation itself is as inhumane and bizarre as anything the creepy Soviet scientists did to dogs in the middle of last century. But they were brushing that off like it was whimsical.

       Well, I guess now we know where the kidnapped children go that aren't raked and tirtured by the elites- they're going to be (if not already) the personal blood bags for those bastards.

       I listened to a podcast just the other day and made note of the topic - I'm pretty sure it was NPR too.

       It was talking about old mice and young mice. Some scientist cut the hind quarters out of each one and sewed them together.

       Yeah - I don't know if it's more often than in the past these things are discussed, but I notice it more now. Time will tell I suppose.
