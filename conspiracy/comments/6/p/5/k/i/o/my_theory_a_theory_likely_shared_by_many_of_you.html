       This gives ammo for the MSM and I've noticed the shills often use it as well....
      </p>
      <p>
       They'll say shit like,
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        "This "investigation" is dangerous and has already led to a shooting. Good thing nobody got hurt! Grow the fuck up!"
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyone remember the 60 minutes bit on fake news?
      </p>
      <p>
       James Alefantis was interviewed on 60 minutes talking about the dangers of how "fake news" has real consequences, and referenced the gunman who supposedly entered CPP. It was totally all in favor of James, the measly vulnerable pizza shop owner, (also happens to be a millionaire and someone of status in DC somehow?),whose parlor is being harassed by "Internet sleuths". They were basically sucking him off and treating him as royalty.
      </p>
      <p>
       They needed some bullshit reason to demonize people looking into this. Since we're dealing with pedophilia and uncovering child abuse, it's kind of hard to make us look bad because we're trying to expose a dark and devious abuse of power, a non partisan issue.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, they decided this "lone shooter" scenario which seems to be quite popular as of lately, made sure nobody got hurt, just to make a point of how, "dangerous false stories can be and how much of an impact they can have on people".
      </p>
      <p>
       It's all staged and fake phony. Hell, most of us were just waiting and expecting what they were gonna throw at us next after they banned our entire subreddit, r/Pizzagate.
      </p>
      <p>
       Smoke and mirrors. And the shills use this as ammo against us constantly.

       Who's to say there isn't one?  I'm not the authority on the matter by any means or the conspiracy king.  The problem is any attempt to organize (i.e. Kickstarter, gofundme, reddit, VOAT, paypals of prominant PGers, etc) was banned, censored, deleted, or shilled to all hell.
      </p>
      <p>
       Surely that's no excuse for not having a PI, but idk what a PI would do that the internet hasn't already done.  Honestly s lot of the PI type could be the users doing the initial research...

       Once they got PG off reddit and isolated it to a site hardly anyone used, it was a lot easier to infiltrate.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lots of drama with mods.  Remember that it's essentially like the Wild West on that site compared to reddit.  Infact, it's like a half way house between reddit and 4chan.  Accusations fly all over the place, bs is called out with proof often there.

       Of course the news is fabricated. George Orwell told us as much straight-up 70 years ago. But people want to trust their beloved TVs. The TV makes them feel 'connected' and 'informed'. must normies trust the TV more than they trust their own family members. That should tell you all you need to know.
