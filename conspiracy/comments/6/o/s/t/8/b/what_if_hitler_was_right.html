<p>First and foremost, I am by know means a fucking Nazi. I could care less what religion you follow or what color of skin you have, we are all just human beings living on a giant rock floating through space. </p>

<p>But with all the shit going on with Israel lately, I&#39;ve been doing a little bit of research on Zionism. And holy fuck, this shit is crazy. The amount of jews in positions of power compared to the total number of Jewish people in the world is absolutely astonishing. There is a legit argument to be made that they run the world (Not in an absolute sense of way, but goddamn do they carry some significant influence).</p>

<p>Anyways, what if Hitler&#39;s hate for the jews was based on the ideology of Zionism? By no means am i trying to condone what he did (obviously he took it to the extreme) or justify his actions, but what if he had a point? That would be crazy as fuck if history looks back and says, &quot;damn, that dude Hitler was right.&quot;</p>

<p>I&#39;m sure I have missed out on plenty of details and have incomplete logic since I haven&#39;t researched yhe subjects to my content. And I may be completely misunderstood about Zionism and not know enough about Hitler and the Nazis. But like I said, it&#39;s just a thought I had. . .</p>
