       Before committing suicide, Chester Bennington complained of V2k "I woke up with Rocky raccoon playing in my head". He also feels his dream is connected to Chris Cornell's death, saying "I dreamt about the beatles" and "I just watched a video of [Chris] singing 'a day in the life' by the beatles'. Dream manipulation is a common feature of targetting. It's possible Chester was "suicided" using mind control technologies in order to make Chris Cornell's murder seem more plausibly suicide.

      <blockquote>

        In 1996, the US Air Force Scientific Advisory Board published a 14-volume study of future developments in weapons called New World Vistas. Tucked away on page 89 of an ancillary 15th volume are some hair-raising insights into the future 'coupling' of man and machine in a section dealing with 'Biological Process Control'. The author refers to an 'explosion' of knowledge in the field of neuroscience, adding, ominously: "One can envision the development of electromagnetic energy sources, the output of which can be pulsed, shaped, and focused, that can couple with the human body in a fashion that will allow one to prevent voluntary muscular movements,
        <strong>
         control emotions (and thus actions), produce sleep, transmit suggestions
        </strong>
        , interfere with both short-term and long-term memory, produce an experience set, and delete an experience set."1 Translating the words 'experience set' from military jargon into plain English, this means, simply, that they envisage the ability to erase your life's memories and substitute a new, fictitious set.

       The 'possible link' is a slight resemblance and a comical amount of conjecture, motivated reasoning, and purposefully misleading disinfo. This place has become so ridiculous in the things people will give credence to without a shred of diligence or critical thinking. It really does a disservice to those trying to uncover real hidden truths of our world, but I guess that's the point.
      </p>

       Congratulations. Your willingness to believe and repeat anything without a shred of evidence is automatically bound to anything else in the 'conspiracy sphere' that may be actually factual. So now 'the official story of 9/11 doesn't add up' is the exact same as 'the earth is flat and controlled by reptiles.'
      </p>
      <p>
       The weaponization of the term conspiracy theory along with the absolute disinformation campaign that comes along with it is so successful, that any critical thinking will forever be lumped in with the most insane tinfoil hat lunacy.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is completely deliberate and purposeful and the veracity at which so many here eat it up and play into it is heartbreaking for those who truly want to know what is happening in the world around them, because the loudest voices are of those who just want to believe in every 'alternative' theory posited and are blinded by confirmation bias and motivated reasoning. Critical thinking is dead. People want to believe so badly in the fact that they are being lied to or the world isn't quite what it seems that they will parrot and believe any line of nonsense they hear or read without a care in the world for evidence or proof.
