<p>Before diving in, let Indra&#39;s Net paint you a picture:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Far away in the heavenly abode of the great god Indra, there is a wonderful net which has been hung by some cunning artificer in such a manner that it stretches out infinitely in all directions. In accordance with the extravagant tastes of deities, the artificer has hung a single glittering jewel in each &quot;eye&quot; of the net, and since the net itself is infinite in dimension, the jewels are infinite in number. There hang the jewels, glittering &quot;like&quot; stars in the first magnitude, a wonderful sight to behold. If we now arbitrarily select one of these jewels for inspection and look closely at it, we will discover that in its polished surface there are reflected all the other jewels in the net, infinite in number. Not only that, but each of the jewels reflected in this one jewel is also reflecting all the other jewels, so that there is an infinite reflecting process occurring.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is the nature of the cosmos - here&#39;s how -</p>

<h1>Background</h1>

<p><strong>Lets think about the basics of how relativity and Einsteins field equations link with quantum mechanics.</strong></p>

<p>Einstein wrote equations to describe how the cubic grid structure of space would behave under the influenece of mass. This is simply a coordinate system that fluxes in response to matter. Imagine cubic lines of force, and imagine what would happen if we introduced mass, and the ensuing contracting that would occur. </p>

<p>We&#39;ve seen depictions of this like so:</p>

<p><a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/files/2012/07/Curved_in_3D.jpg">http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/files/2012/07/Curved_in_3D.jpg</a></p>

<p>However, there&#39;s something thats not immediately obvious. These equations <strong>were only solved when an infinity is introduced</strong> - creating our formal descripion of a black hole. Put simply the black hole is massive or energetic enough for the cubic grid to ultimately become a single point - infinite curvature of space causing &#39;singularity&#39;.</p>

<p>What also is curious about this solution to Einstein&#39;s equations is that <strong>it&#39;s the equation used to calculate orbitals for planets/suns/etc - even though it predicts a black hole in the center.</strong> It&#39;s said to be an approximation, but I&#39;ll tell you why it isn&#39;t. </p>

<p>Lets jump over to the basics of quantum mechanics.</p>

<p>Quantum field theory states that each and every point in space is filled with field energy, such as the electromagnetic field. Therefore, each and every point in of the field must be divided or quantized into a harmonic oscillator, which is a fancy word that just means an energetic oscillation, which can be envisioned simply as a ball and spring. Think of a fractal sine wave. This is what is being envisioned in the &#39;quantum field&#39; - and since each point must be quantized, the smaller the &#39;piece&#39; or section of the wave that you quantize, the higer the frequency, the higher the energy. </p>

<p>This leads to a formally infinite energy at each point in space. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum_energy">Wiki - Vacuum Energy</a> There is no lower limit on the size of the quanta, thus there is no limit to the amount of energy.</p>

<p>However, Max Planck figured out that our Universe&#39;s energetic fields appear to work on a smallest quanta of a specific length, the planck length. This is how he (Planck) figured out how much energy photons are putting out from light emitters - which was also giving an infinite energy for ultraviolet radiation. This obviously didn&#39;t jive. After quantizing the energy into planck length fluctuations of the planck mass energy - so that this light or energy was being sent in planck-cutoff sized packets, he was able to solve the UV catastrophe. </p>

<p>This led physicists to put a &#39;cutoff size&#39; of the harmonic oscillator filled quantum field permetaing all space at the planck length - called renormalization - because we now know that the electromagnetic field is made up of planck-sized packets.</p>

<p>However, this <em>still</em> is absurdly more energy than we can directly observe. Using the planck length quantization you are still left with a harmonic oscillation energy of the planck mass which when multiplied by the amount that fit in a cm<sup>3</sup> of vacuum leaves 10<sup>93</sup> grams, orders of magnitude higher than what you would get if you smushed the whole Universe into a cm<sup>3.</sup></p>

<p>This is now said to simply be virtual and unreal - its basically written off.</p>

<p>So we have an infinity in the predicted field energy of the vacuum, and we have an infinite curvature of space solution to relativity that describes all gravitation.</p>

<p>John Wheeler was one of the first to describe a geon, which is pure field energy so massive that it could keep itself together gravitationally, just like the Einstein field equations predict for a black hole surrounding a physical mass. </p>

<p>So all we need is to change our perspective on a few things to knit this together.</p>

<p>The vacuum energy of the planck density IS real, space = the quantum vacuum = 10<sup>93</sup> grams/cm<sup>3.</sup> The vacuum is a series of overlapping geons, it&#39;s made of overlapping planck spherical units (PSU) of the planck mass. Each PSU being a spherical oscillation of light whose simple field energy is massive enough to keep it gravitationally together, it&#39;s a black hole made of light. This black hole is a Kerr-Newman black hole, which gives it certain properties, one being that it could have a spin state of 1 or -1, allowing it to essentially function as a bit of information.</p>

<p>This black hole is the infinity that links QM and relativities infinities.</p>

<p>Space IS the quantum vacuum, and these are not separate, and space is not simply an abstract coordinate system. </p>

<p>Now we have placed a black hole at each and every point in space which is what the Einstein Field equations are showing us as the solution for mass/curvature.</p>

<h1>Holographic</h1>

<p>If we take this completely natural length and mass unit and see how many fit in the proton (proton volume / planck sphere volume * planck mass) <strong>we yield the mass of the Universe @10<sup>55</sup> grams.</strong></p>

<p>This is telling us something <em>enormous</em> about the nature of reality, <strong>it is holographic.</strong> In the holographic plate sense of the word, no matter how small you slice it the slice retains the whole image.</p>

<p>Because the planck unit in a planck mass is energetic enough to make itself a black hole, it <em>also</em> creates a formal Einstein Rosen bridge, an effect on the Einstein field equations that describe a wormhole that flattens distant coordinates in the space grid to a single point. Simply imagine the coordinate system being pinched together, like a stretched black hole. The conditions that allow this to arise is called a Bose Einstein Condensate.</p>

<p>This means the quantum vacuum and space, being made of PSUs, is connected everywhere pretty much like a hyperdimensional overlay that knits all 3d coordiates into a singularity, put simply - at the Universe&#39;s most fundamental level, all points in space are touching at length=0 geometrically. </p>

<p>This is how the information sharing works, and how each proton is a lens into the holographic reality.</p>

<p>Lastly, we have to re-envision matter as a function of this space/quantum vacuum, not as a particle that gets it&#39;s energy from some higgs field.</p>

<p>So we have described space as a superfluid (Bose Einstein Condensate) of quantized light energy packets, of which fill the entire universe with infinite energy, normally unperceivable but allow an infinite potential of creation at each point, that when &#39;activated&#39; by simply having multiple PSUs co-spin or co-orbit (jitterbugging of the aforementioned vector equilibrium) at the speed of light - becomes matter.</p>

<p>To calculate the protons holographic mass and standard rest mass is very simple.</p>

<p>When we divide the proton volume by the planck spherical volume (they are overlapping, so you can simply divide one into the other) and multiply by the planck mass, we yield 10<sup>55</sup> grams, which is the currently estimated mass of the observable Universe.</p>

<p>If we then generalize the holographic principle, and apply it - by simply dividing the surface PSU&#39;s by the volume PSUs &amp; multiply by 2*planck mass, we nail the standard mass of the proton at 10<sup>-24</sup> grams.</p>

<p>There is even more evidence this approach is correct. By using the accepted proton charge radius, we yield a mass value within 0.069 10<sup>-24</sup> grams.</p>

<p>However, by using the new (2013) muonic hydrogen proton radius that deviates from about 4% from the standard model&#39;s prediction, we yield a mass of 1.673349 * 10<sup>-24</sup> grams, which is within .00072*10<sup>-24</sup> grams of CODATA. </p>

<p>This means that we have the only algebraic method of deriving the proton charge radius in existence, and it is within one sigma of the new muonic hydrogen charge radius.</p>

<p>Here we can see that the holographic surface membrane of the proton instantly distributes the majority of the protons mass energy density through the BEC lattice of space, to 10<sup>40</sup> more protons - the amount that isn&#39;t instantly transferred just so happens to equal the standard rest mass of the proton.</p>

<p>The strong force is satisfied via this black hole proton, simply due to the immense mass dilation at the surface of the proton due to torquing space around it. The vortex at the protons surface is immensely energetic due to it&#39;s speed, however, even moving slightly away from the surface the force drops logarithmically. </p>
