       Her husband Prince Charles had a well documented friendship with Jimmy Savile, there are even some claims that Jimmy Savile had 'keys to the palace'.

       Prince Charles wanted Jimmy Savile to be Harry's godfather, which obviously would have upset Princess Diana.

       Jimmy Savile also admitted that getting a knighthood was 'a relief because it got him off the hook'.

       Their friendship is well documented indeed.

       Both men also had a 'very close friendship with sex abuse bishop Peter Ball'.

       Go to 18:10 in this video if you want to see Jimmy Savile talking about God.

       Next time someone calls you crazy for thinking that 'Elite bloodlines' exist, show them this.
      </p>
      <p>
       All members of the Royal Family are Descendants of Alfred the Great.
       <br/>
       Royal Family Tree (849 - Present):

       John Leckland was King of England in 1199, over 500 years before the founding of America.
      </p>
      <p>
       All Presidents of the U.S.A are decendants of John Leckland:

      </p>
      <p>
       But remember, ruling elite bloodlines don't exist and they certainly don't serve the forces of darkness.

       She was no commoner. She had a highly prized aristocratic bloodline, which is why she was approved to be Charles's bride. I honestly don't know why people keep saying she was a commoner lately,  because it simply has no basis in reality. Period
