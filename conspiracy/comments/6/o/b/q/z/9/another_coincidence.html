        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>So we&#39;ve really had a bumpy week.  The peruvian / chilean 6.4 fit the model quite right from my last post, with a 7.7 making its appearance off the coast of east russia. </p>

<p><a href="https://earthquaketrack.com/r/mauritius-reunion/recent">We had a strangelet this morning in the mauritas reunion. 5.9</a> which likely compacted the tension needed for a Nepalese event to bare frutition. *This coming after another sizeable jolt in east afganistan. </p>

<p><a href="http://services.swpc.noaa.gov/images/geospace-1-day.png">I imagine as the current winds reach a holding speed</a> of -330km/s that a Philippians and Nepalese  event will become more imminent. I still have 48 hours +/- on my last update and merely wanted to state that: <strong>These regions are still on watch</strong>. </p>

<p>I imagine that the dense winds we are recieving now are flowing from the northern coronal hole stream (CH15) which is slightly prolonging another massive incident. 
<a href="http://www.solarham.net/latest_imagery/211b.htm">Seen here:</a></p>

<p>With the exceeding speeds, I imagine the larger quakes in this current seismic series are now dwindling off. Yet as we reach a planetary calm post CH15 making its way off the current solar lens, that <em>this will change</em> allowing for another 7.0 magnitude quake. <strong>Hence my keeping these regions in warning.</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6n69rj/huge_flash_m11_flare_just_now_earthquakes_inside/?utm_content=title&amp;utm_medium=user&amp;utm_source=reddit">My last quake update can be found here:</a></p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> <em>that the last update on my thread raised the magnitude to 7.8,</em> <strong>(which a 7.7 greatly complimented...)</strong></p>

<p><strong>Aside from the general earthquake watch:</strong></p>

<p>**We are still actively accepting programmers, coders, techies, and curious helping hands in our sub <a href="/r/parsingsol">/r/parsingsol</a> </p>

<p><a href="/u/Julianthepagan">/u/Julianthepagan</a> is the project lead at this time. Please contact this user and special thanks to the member from google that recently joined the team. It means alot that you are all dedicating your time and experience to our project. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ParsingSol/comments/6mfun0/next_steps_for_parsingsol_project/?utm_content=title&amp;utm_medium=hot&amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_name=ParsingSol">If you are hoping to help our team please read this thread</a> , <strong>The goal and focus is to create an application far more capable of assessing these events</strong>, <em>(then a human like myself ever could)</em></p>

<p>To touch base on that there are millions of seismic events on record. So creating an algorithm which accounts for each and every event, is near impossible from a humans ability. While a computer assisted model could make the calculations <em>likely</em> in <em>seconds</em>. </p>

<p>What we hope to do is segregate the events from largest to smallest. Extracting the sequencing, frequency, timing, and velocity; in hopes a comparative algorith could process a live-feed. To assess the likelihood of an incoming seismic event sequence.</p>

<p>*this model would be highly based on <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;url=http://www.predpol.com/&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj-oeGZoZbVAhUL22MKHeiIAV4QFggeMAA&amp;usg=AFQjCNHcMeePibPn9dhgIDW4cS3ogKf3bQ">&quot;PREDPOL&#39;s&quot;</a> which uses criminal statistics, and events; to assess areas officers should be placed in duty in-advance. </p>

<p><strong>(the general concept is to use solar wind as a crime statistic).</strong> <em>with seismic events being the effective &#39;areas of risk</em>.</p>

<p><strong>So if you are capable of that type of programming, or assisting us in that goal in any way</strong>. <strong>Please write <a href="/u/julianthepagan">/u/julianthepagan</a> immediately!</strong></p>

<p><em>Aside from that</em></p>

<p>To my friends here, the camping trip with my GF was amazing! I am pretty sure shes the girl I want to marry. 
Totes adorb, and I&#39;ve not been this happy in years!</p>

<p><strong>So my current life goals have now expanded:</strong></p>

<p><em>(which are)</em></p>

<p>Build this POC (Proof of concept), and introduce it to IBM! 
(Hopefully making a sale). Repaying all users that assisted in the best way I can! &amp; then hopefully gaining the ability to full on Marry the girl of my dreams! Finally completing the task of Buying my first home! </p>

<p>Honestly I talked to the mods about crowd sourcing, and they weren&#39;t exactly against it. Yet I&#39;d want to certainly speak with an attorney to assess the legal complications of accepting funds. In light of both getting married or building this model. <strong>Yes, they are both serious goals of mine</strong></p>

<p><em>I&#39;ve been pretty financially impacted and am in debt</em>. I have a dire need for oral surgery <em>(I cannot afford)</em>. </p>

<p>So if you users can understand that Ive been a pretty consistent user, and have really put in some work into this idea. That I am open about my life goals, and have positive intentions. I may consider exploring a crowd sourced campaign. Not just to get married. But to factually pay these services. Making this POC, for IBM much faster, then I could without the financial resources to afford its renduring. </p>

<p><strong>IBM or any Employers that wish to hire me</strong> if your really seriously exploring my work. Please just hire me. I may not be absolutely perfect at this. But I&#39;d argue that my results are both very consistent, and that my concept is likely worth the investment. Feel free to research the direct posts I&#39;ve made and explore each and every report I&#39;ve made. I&#39;d argue that statistically, there is something here. Based on the math alone. So why not just make an investment?</p>

<p>Usgs spends millions on advancing a 30 second warning system. I have no idea why they have been so reluctant to even assess my work or offer me a financially backed explatory contract. </p>

<p>To me this is a job. Its not an easy job. Its a full on proposal and promise to deliver a potentially amazing project. It may be highly highly accurate. It may fail entirely. Yet the wasting of millions when such an affordable system could replace it, seems slightly disappointing. </p>

<p><strong>last update:</strong></p>

<p>I don&#39;t have a job. My bills are behind. I am currently looking for work; But child support wants to prosecute likely within a month. <em>(f a payment isnt made in a week)</em>.</p>

<p>So if I disappear. Sorry-</p>

<p><strong>Trying my best as always-</strong></p>

<p>Sigh,</p>

<p>P.s. Yes this is why I am always stressed. It would be amazing if anyone would offer me a job. Based on my work ethic.... My past history and education (via record) is laughable. Factually its because I felt like a wasted body that I began doing this in the first place. </p>

<p>I basically just want to prove I can build this. I want to make my Mark on the world, and scientific communities. 
So I need your help reddit. </p>

<p><strong>Feel free to post or pm me if you can help make that happen.</strong></p>

<p><em>My times just about up here in that regard-</em></p>

<p>All my love reddit! Have a super awesome week all the same!</p>

<p>:)</p>
