      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Are you lost
In your lies
Do you tell yourself I don't realize
       </p>
       <p>
        Your crusade's a disguise
Replace freedom with fear
You trade money for lives
       </p>
       <p>
        I'm aware of what you've done
       </p>
       <p>
        No, No more sorrow
I've paid for your mistakes
Your time is borrowed
Your time has come to be replaced
       </p>
       <p>
        I see pain
I see need
I see liars and thieves
Abuse power with greed
       </p>
       <p>
        I had hope
I believed
But I'm beginning to think that I've been deceived
       </p>
       <p>
        You will pay for what you've done
       </p>
       <p>
        No, No more sorrow
I've paid for your mistakes
Your time is borrowed
Your time has come to be replaced
       </p>
       <p>
        Thieves and hypocrites
Thieves and hypocrites
Thieves and hypocrites
       </p>
       <p>
        No, No more sorrow
I've paid for your mistakes
Your time is borrowed
Your time has come to be replaced
       </p>
       <p>
        Your time has come to be replaced
Your time has come to be erased

        "Now Linkin Park’s latest unexpected collaboration is with none other than President Bill Clinton — sort of. For better or for worse, the 42nd president isn’t adding his saxophone stylings to the nü-metal band’s next LP. Instead, he’s helping fund and promote co-frontman Mike Shinoda’s recycling business in Haiti."

       It has been mentioned by a Detroit reporter that Cornell came across a friend of his in a black book pertaining to pedophilia.
       <a href="https://www.ifonly.com/m/charity/26/the-chris-vicky-cornell-foundation">
        He and his wife had a foundation to help victims of child sexual abuse

       <a href="http://www.neonnettle.com/news/2437-chester-bennington-was-about-to-expose-the-truth-behind-chris-cornell-s-death">
        Not sure if this is true, but again worth noting; Was Chester about to expose the truth about Cornell's death?

       Found dead on Cornell's birthday. His body was found 1 minute after LP released a new video, and LP album and single streaming has increased 70 fold. C'mon man ... that's all a little
       <em>
        too
       </em>
       convenient. Something is fucky here.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, given all of that, and the lyrics to that song which Chester wrote, I find it easier to believe this guy knew
       <em>
        something
       </em>
       . He didn't commit suicide IMO.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean fuck, what if
       <em>
        Shinoda
       </em>
       was the name Cornell found?
