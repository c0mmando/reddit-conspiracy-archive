<blockquote>
<p>Are you lost
In your lies
Do you tell yourself I don&#39;t realize</p>

<p>Your crusade&#39;s a disguise
Replace freedom with fear
You trade money for lives</p>

<p>I&#39;m aware of what you&#39;ve done</p>

<p>No, No more sorrow
I&#39;ve paid for your mistakes
Your time is borrowed
Your time has come to be replaced</p>

<p>I see pain
I see need
I see liars and thieves
Abuse power with greed</p>

<p>I had hope
I believed
But I&#39;m beginning to think that I&#39;ve been deceived</p>

<p>You will pay for what you&#39;ve done</p>

<p>No, No more sorrow
I&#39;ve paid for your mistakes
Your time is borrowed
Your time has come to be replaced</p>

<p>Thieves and hypocrites
Thieves and hypocrites
Thieves and hypocrites</p>

<p>No, No more sorrow
I&#39;ve paid for your mistakes
Your time is borrowed
Your time has come to be replaced</p>

<p>Your time has come to be replaced
Your time has come to be erased</p>

<p><em>&quot;Now Linkin Park’s latest unexpected collaboration is with none other than President Bill Clinton — sort of. For better or for worse, the 42nd president isn’t adding his saxophone stylings to the nü-metal band’s next LP. Instead, he’s helping fund and promote co-frontman Mike Shinoda’s recycling business in Haiti.&quot;</em> </p>

<p><a href="http://imgur.com/Fd5Asxi">This dude has some pretty stout military references for a fucking recycling manager</a></p>

<p><a href="http://imgur.com/iQuZhbO">Im not at all sold on the Podesta angle, but the rest of this infographic bears mentioning.</a></p>

<p>It has been mentioned by a Detroit reporter that Cornell came across a friend of his in a black book pertaining to pedophilia. <a href="https://www.ifonly.com/m/charity/26/the-chris-vicky-cornell-foundation">He and his wife had a foundation to help victims of child sexual abuse</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.neonnettle.com/news/2437-chester-bennington-was-about-to-expose-the-truth-behind-chris-cornell-s-death">Not sure if this is true, but again worth noting; Was Chester about to expose the truth about Cornell&#39;s death?</a></p>

<p><a href="http://imgur.com/RXaboyt">Most of us are aware of Saturn worship, which makes this intriguing.</a></p>

<p>Found dead on Cornell&#39;s birthday. His body was found 1 minute after LP released a new video, and LP album and single streaming has increased 70 fold. C&#39;mon man ... that&#39;s all a little <em>too</em> convenient. Something is fucky here. </p>

<p>Now, given all of that, and the lyrics to that song which Chester wrote, I find it easier to believe this guy knew <em>something</em>. He didn&#39;t commit suicide IMO. </p>

<p>I mean fuck, what if <em>Shinoda</em> was the name Cornell found? </p>
