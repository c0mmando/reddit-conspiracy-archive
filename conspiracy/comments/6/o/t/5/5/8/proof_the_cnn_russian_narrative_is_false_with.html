       CNN is fake news, and I'm going to prove it to you, because the evidence for this particular issue has been sitting in the leaked emails for ages, waiting for a reason for me to talk about it. I'm going to prove to you that this narrative is shyte:

       Yuri Chaika: The Russian master of 'Kompromat' thought to be behind Donald Trump Jr meeting

       </a>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Chaika was trying to push back against a US sanctions law, the Magnitsky Act, in part by trying to discredit an American-born businessman, William J. Browder, who had lobbied for its passage.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Yuri Chaika is Veselnetskaya's old boss.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yuri Chaika was recently exposed in a documentary about his family's racketeering:

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       The Clintons bragged about helping try to defeat the Magnitsky Act.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        “With the help of the research team, we killed a Bloomberg story trying to link HRC’s opposition to the Magnitsky bill to a $500,000 speech that WJC gave in Moscow,” the email reads, referring to the former president by the initials that stand for William Jefferson Clinton.

       This gets way worse, though.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yuri Chaika works for the Deep State. Here he is, in an email, spilling the beans on internal Russian activities.

      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Chaika said he has already been under a lot of heat because of the Politkovskaya arrests. He said that he would rather not tell me about the "Chechen mastermind" they arrested. I asked if this was because he was not really a mastermind and Chaika said that "many things needed to be tied up as we head into this election and the end of Putin's reign." [I know this is strange, but he kept saying things like, "Ivanov needs to have control over the situation he's about to enter into.... Ivanov is known for his distance from such situations, so they need to be wrapped up."
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       It gets worse, though. Yuri Chaika is on a list with a lot of other intelligence assets.

       Since most people don't understand the connections here, because fake news CNN is careful to never actually name the corrupt Russians involved. The racketeering in the Russian energy companies is where MANY scandals are centered around. They're murderous.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        the company builds pipelines around the world and Gazprom wanted the the company, so the owner of the company ended up with his shoulders broken and stuffed into a pipeline. Then they turned on the nat gas and he suffocated while his limbs flew off in the 50 mph nat gas flow.....
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Do you know John Podesta was on the Board for Joule Unlimited with the dude from Gazprom? Also the guy who ran Troika Dialog. CNN doesn't like to talk about the Deep State assets being exposed, but it is all there.
      </p>
      <p>
       In this document, the Podestas admit that they are under the control of a foreign entity, Troika Dialog and Sberbank, and the reason this form was submitted was only because of the Panama Paper leaks. Otherwise, this never would have been reported.

       This is a screencap from the Offshore Leaks (offshoreleaks.icij.org) that shows RAS Corporate Services and Troika Dialog are connected:

       This man is the Russian that ties together Troika Dialog, Gazprom, Joule Unlimited and the Kremlin.

       His money went to the Clintons, the Podestas and many others including into the coffers of DNC campaigns.
      </p>
      <p>
       The more that the news talks about Russia, the more the public is becoming aware of these connections. Meanwhile, I've been shouting it from the rooftops for over a year, since the Panama Papers, and everyone keeps calling me a conspiracy theorist because this is really what CNN is doing...
      </p>
      <p>
       Providing only three avenues of thought in the US. "Left" "Right" and "conspiracy theorist". As more issues of concern are pushing people into the "extreme" realm, it works to discredit those who really have the wherewithal to recognize and trace this corruption.
