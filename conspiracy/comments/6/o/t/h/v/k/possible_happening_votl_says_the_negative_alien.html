<p>So does this mean the fake alien invasion psy-op has been called off?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Never lose your hope, haha</p>

<p>votl a while ago:</p>

<p>&quot;The media needs to be brought on board first, as disclosure is intended to be made before the intel committees of Congress...and it is the intent of those involved that these hearings will be open to the public and broadcast to the world....because every person on this planet deserves to know the truth and, collectively, will decide what is to be done with collaborators who will be named as having committed crimes against humanity. </p>

<p>We already know who will be involved with the disclosure process and, yes, it is currently the plan that  in-the-flesh ETIs are to be present when this occurs. This is the one and only chance for any members of the media and Congress who have  been going along with marching orders as political puppets and propaganda mouth pieces to step up and make amends for what they&#39;ve done.  </p>

<p>Many were forced to do this against their own will, which is why they will now have the opportunity to exert true free will and  either help us as their Mea Culpa, or rebuff us and face consequences deemed fit by the public. </p>

<p>Of course, there will be those who will not  be afforded this opportunity for redemption, as what they have done exhibits a pattern of freely and willingly committing horrendous acts  against their fellow humans. Again, this will all occur as the mop up phase transitions. </p>

<p>Shortly after what we have stated above, fleets  from both the benevolent SSPs of Earth and benevolent federations of ETIs will start making themselves known in very obvious &amp; public way.  Whether the USAF likes it or not, they will not be in control of any US Space Corps...and they will be lucky to continue existing as a  stand alone branch of the United States military once the treason at the top levels with respect to 9/11 &amp; other events &amp; matter is exposed</p>

<p>As for the role of the United States in the post disclosure, post first contact era...you will be learning to &quot;play nice&quot; with the rest of the world. There will be no single superpower and there will no longer be competition between nations to try and control the world.</p>

<p>You will be moving past that era of your history. That said, @PutinRF_Eng and Iran will be vindicated, while Israel, Saudi Arabia and the British elite including the royal family will be exposed for they really are at the top levels in each nation and how they have not only collaborated to draw the United States into conflict and undermine its power and safety, but did so with other nations in the hope of instigating WWIII to carry out what was a planned depopulation agenda created in league with certain malevolent ETI factions which would have left the elite as the survivors of humanity sharing the planet with an alliance of malevolent ETIs which deceived your leaders in the 1930s, when we all revealed ourselves to humanity for the first time in the modern era. Their goal was to officially conquer Earth and they got quite close to doing so. </p>

<p>Your technological advancements since WWII can be attributed to these negative ETIs. While the tech may seem highly advanced to you, the reality is that it&#39;s what&#39;s called &quot;junk tech&quot; as in it&#39;s very basic compared to what is kept from you.&quot;</p>
