        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>There is a lack of awareness about the shocking reality of privacy policies.</p>

<p>Im offering the opportunity for any like minded individuals to get involved, and contribute their own research or analysis to assembling a huge collection of the misleading, subliminal and invasive ways in which peoples personal information is gathered, stored and used for the purpose of profit. </p>

<p>Im pretty certain, 99% of you reading this, have never read and checked exactly what your allowing a company to access.</p>

<p>Access can be legally gained to your device microphones, cameras and to your exact location, and thats nothing compared to the data they collect about you. </p>

<p>People need to know about these invasive terms before accepting to use a service. </p>

<p>We should know about the intrusive statements that get buried in thousands of pages, to discourage anyone from actually reading them. Most people wouldn&#39;t agree if they read it.</p>

<p>Some profound policies that have been collected already - <a href="http://imgur.com/a/sIkYl">http://imgur.com/a/sIkYl</a></p>

<p>I&#39;m going to explain what this is about so please read it before deciding if you&#39;d like to be involved. Ive included a random few screen shots of some crazy policies weve probably all agreed too.</p>

<p>Privacy is a Fundamental Human Right, and ours is being violated right now. </p>

<p>The recent expansion in &#39;smart&#39; &amp; similar technology is enabling your personal and private data to be collected, analyzed and worst of all, its being bought and sold with unbelievable profits.</p>

<p>Society has been mislead into the mindset of this being acceptable </p>

<p>The biggest jaw dropping fact about the entire data industry...
Is that we are tricked into giving them persmission, to do what they please with our personal information.</p>

<p>You&#39;d be arrested on the spot, if you were seen searching through a strangers waste and gathering their personal details.</p>

<p>However, if you inadvertently got them to agree. Concealing your intent so they lack understanding. </p>

<p>Your acting well within the law when &#39;stealing&#39; their information.</p>

<p>That is the fundamental purpose of a privacy policy. 
Its a &#39;Hostile Hall Pass&#39;. To legalise their actions. 
(Yes i&#39;m coining Hostile hall pass! :-o)</p>

<p>Have you ever read a companies privacy policy before signing it? </p>

<p>I&#39;d put a lifetime earnings on 99% of humanity answering No to that question, let me know if you have.</p>

<p>More often than not, these documents are thousands of pages long and written in a way which causes confusion to those without experience in legalities. </p>

<p>So understandably, this discourages anyone reading it.</p>

<p>But to use a service, your obliged to sign the policy. And for the majority of services you dont even have to sign!</p>

<p>By simply using something, like &#39;google&#39; as an example, you automatically consent to, the often barbaric, requests of what they want to do with your information. </p>

<p>This consent, frees the company of any legal implications and enables them to do whatever they want. And if they want to do something more than they&#39;ve already stated, theyll just bury it in the list and force you to accept again.</p>

<p>Im sure most people have had that notification, requesting you to &#39;sign before continuing to use their service&#39; ?</p>

<p>The research ive done so far is on the google privacy policy and and ive managed to spend time covering a small amount of the Microsoft OS privacy policy. </p>

<p>Below ive linked a few random ones ive saved 
<a href="http://imgur.com/a/sIkYl">http://imgur.com/a/sIkYl</a>  (same link as at the top)</p>

<p>Some of the statements in their policies are truly insane. And im not talking about the odd one, its a constant stream of violations to your human right of privacy.</p>

<p>Its truly mind blowing, by simply using a service, they can auto access things like microphones, cameras, caches, browser data, personal data etc. </p>

<p>There is also evidence of how these &#39;packets&#39;, containing of your personal information, are collected from many different sources, and gathered together to create an amalgamation of your data.</p>

<p>&#39;Data Profiling&#39; seems an appropriate way to describe this process, though i haven&#39;t checked if it means something else already</p>

<p>These documents are large for a reason, and thats to discourage people doing what im doing right now. But, working together, the individual time of a contribution is greatly reduced</p>

<p>Im looking for people who are willing to dedicate a small amount of their time to research. Even if its just half an hour or so. I have a list of policies set up, to ensure two people arent looking through the same one, But if youd rather do your own thing then thats good, it would be good to see other peoples findings from different sources.</p>

<p>The intent behind this is to open peoples eyes to the fact that theyre signing there soul away on a daily basis and also, to be a reference people can check to know what bad things they are actually signing up too. </p>

<p>Possibly going to create an accessible online version of an organised archive with all the findings - if anyone could help in this?</p>

<p>Screenshots of profound statements are best, jpg or png. If its possible to annotate them like i have in a few, then that would be great. </p>

<p>Dont forget to crop your outer browser from the screen shot if you dont want the world to know what porn you&#39;ve bookmarked.</p>

<p>Leave a comment or dm if you&#39;d like to be a part of this</p>

<p>If anyone has suggestions or constructive ideas, please share. 
Thanks for reading</p>
