        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>What are your opinions on climate change? Do you think it&#39;s really happening? Is it caused by industry emissions? Is it a globalist conspiracy? Are methane leaks in the East Siberian arctic shelf going to wipe out humanity? Is it a neo-communist scheme to redistribute wealth to third world countries and institute a carbon tax? </p>

<p>Let&#39;s talk. And maybe try to be polite with each other?</p>

<p>Full disclosure, I work in the sector and I believe climate change is happening and caused by human activity. I&#39;m also a conspiracy theorist, so I want to hear your thoughts.  </p>

<p>Just wanted to start a discussion on something different that&#39;s interesting to me. I&#39;m sick of all the politics bullshit. </p>

<p>By the way, check out this documentary:

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m more worried about pollution than global warming.  The former has killed various species of shit.  The latter: well climate has been going up and down throughout history and since no scientists have addressed that fact properly (instead, scoffing at researchers who want to investigate all sides) - makes me and everybody else even more skeptical.</p>

<p>I agree. This didn&#39;t happen by itself. You probably know more than I do that people have known that pollution was/is trashing the environment. Have read that if something isn&#39;t done very soon, we can expect worse. </p>

<p>Another worry: if radioactive water is dumped in the Pacific Ocean at Fukushima. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>One I saw was a carbon remover that filtered carbon out of the air.  The cost for a bank of these would be a billion dollars and it would be capable of removing as much CO2 as 30000 trees.  </p>

<p>So, why not just plant a million trees?  Seems like there may be a more devious purpose for deforestation these days.  </p>

<p>How many times they said if we pass XÂ° the ocean will die, methane it&#39;s going to make things worse exponentially, solar radiation/reflection/whatever, the world will be a desert, everything underwater.</p>

<p>If we hit 2 degrees above preindustrial levels, things will indeed become cataclysmic. Is that what you&#39;re questioning? It&#39;s not like there&#39;s just a small group of scientists from a particular group saying these things. Scientists all over the planet, working for different institutions, in different countries, are all pointing in the same direction. </p>

<p>On the methane being released from the East Siberian shelf, here&#39;s what a team of Russian scientists had to say:</p>

<p>We really are flirting with the apocalypse. Having worked in the field, the irony to us is that the public believes climate change science is being exaggerated. In fact, the opposite is true, the science is routinely being downplayed, so that people have no idea how bad it truly is. Most people seem to believe that Al Gore represented the latest state of the science, but he&#39;s not a scientist... </p>

<p>Thinking people would look into what the scientists have to say on the issue, not politicians. Don&#39;t you think? </p>
