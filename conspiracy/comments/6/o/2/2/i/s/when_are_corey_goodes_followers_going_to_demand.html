       In September of 2015 during the height of internet buzz surrounding Corey Goode and disclosure of the secret space program I wrote an article entitled "Regarding the Secret Space Program" and posted it on our website and blog. (
       <a href="http://theobjectreport.blogspot.com/2015/09/regarding-secret-space-program.html">
        http://theobjectreport.blogspot.com/2015/09/regarding-secret-space-program.html
       </a>
       ) Much of it referenced Corey and other SSP whistleblowers who were popping up such as William Tompkins. As part of that article I created an illustration from scratch of a hypothetical design for one of these SSP cylinder-shaped spacecraft, the "USSS Hillenkoetter". My illustration was based SOLELY upon the description of a photo of one of these crafts that Gary McKinnon gave during a video interview with Richard Gray of the "Educating Humanity" blog. Gary described the craft as a "dark gray cylinder shape with five geodesic domes situated at each end of the craft" My illustration depicted this arrangement, but everything else in the illustration (including windows and the docking bay) was purely speculative and straight out of my imagination. I'm a professional illustrator and graphic designer by trade, I have illustrated military concept aircraft for several major aerospace companies, so I have some experience with the design of military craft.
      </p>
      <p>
       My article was picked up by Dr. Michael Salla and reposted to his Facebook page and retweeted via his twitter feed. It was at this point that I reached out directly to Corey Goode via his Sphere Being Alliance website and offered--FOR FREE--to work with him and his team on any illustrations or scene depictions they might need, simply because I felt strongly about the information he was releasing at that time. Plus, I love doing this kind of illustration work where it's not all inside a set parameter.
      </p>
      <p>
       I got zero response from him. No problem, perhaps he already had an artist lined up and didn't need any help? Several weeks after contacting him--and including the link to my SSP craft illustration--suddenly THIS illustration showed up on his website:
       <a href="http://imgur.com/D1qlXKh">
        http://imgur.com/D1qlXKh
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       My original illustration for reference:

        http://www.theobjectreport.com/media/solar_warden_rev1.png
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Also this, which is still being currently used on his site:
       <a href="https://spherebeingalliance.com/e107_themes/sba/images/slide1.jpg">
        https://spherebeingalliance.com/e107_themes/sba/images/slide1.jpg

       <a href="http://theobjectreport.com/media/corey-goode-copyright-infringement.jpg">
        http://theobjectreport.com/media/corey-goode-copyright-infringement.jpg
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       I even theorized with my illustration that the electromagnetic fields would be bar-bell shaped which he clearly depicts in that image above, an image recently used at the SSP conference. So suddenly my idea is exactly how it is in real life?? Come on!! I'll let you be the judge here, but that illustration blatantly rips off my design which, as I mentioned earlier, is based upon McKinnon's description along with my own artistic license.
      </p>
      <p>
       I posted my image in the comments section of Corey's website along with a graphic pointing out all of the design elements that were directly copied from it and asked him to provide credit to the source of his artwork. My comment was immediately removed and I was totally ignored.
      </p>
      <p>
       This tells me two very important things;
      </p>
      <p>
       1) Corey Goode did not provide his artist with any description of what one of these ships looks like, he simply took my image and told them to "make it look like this." To me this is proof that he doesn't know what these craft look like and has probably never seen one much less been aboard one.
      </p>
      <p>
       2) Corey Goode is opportunistic and won't hesitate to steal artwork from other sources in order to promote his own agenda. Now he's working on a graphic novel, will my design be part of that as well?
      </p>
      <p>
       To me, this is just more evidence that he's fabricating this entire story. I personally do believe there is an SSP in place and I believe there is a Solar Warden fleet out there. But for someone who claims to be part of the SSP and to have been aboard these ships, then why rip off artwork from another source?? Why not just say "no, this is what it actually looks like...not that."
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not happy that my artwork was essentially stolen with no credit given even after I offered to help him for free. I have neither the time nor the energy to call him out on this again as I will obviously be ignored. If I were to come forward with my real name and turn this into a copyright infringement, I could... but I have a business to run and a family. The topic of Ufology doesn't go over well with my clients, so I keep that part of my life in the shadows, hence the silly "Agent K" moniker.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've been quietly researching the UFO topic for over 20 years and I have written dozens of articles and created dozens of scene recreation illustrations (some of which have also been ripped off by other researchers), so I'm not out to prove anything to anyone. I'm simply calling Corey Goode out on using the core elements of my original illustration to promote his own agenda without citing proper credit to the source.
      </p>
      <p>
       Actions speak louder than words and Corey's actions show (to me) that he's not genuine and won't hesitate to take advantage of other people to promote his agenda. So much for your "service to others" bullshit, Corey!
