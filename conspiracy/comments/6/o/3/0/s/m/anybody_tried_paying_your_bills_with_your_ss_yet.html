        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>So, ok, back in the day, the US was in trouble with bankers, so to get out of it, we literally commodified (made into commodities) natural born men and women, as well as placing all of your assets (a portion of the wealth of the commons) into a trust that is owned by.. Guess who? The Fed Reserve. They accomplished the first part, the commodification, by labeling each man and woman, at birth, as a &quot;person&quot;, which is a legal term, and not the name for the original natural human. Therefore, as persons, we are susceptible to a set of societal &quot;rules&quot; (statutes, policies, etc) that are not <em>laws</em> which natural men are subject. </p>

<p>Yes this is approaching sovereignty, nigh anarchistic/revolutionary, but please, restrain thy jerked knees!</p>

<p>Also, as a side note, the origin of the word &quot;person&quot; is very interesting: It derives from a pair of Greek words, <em>per</em>, through; <em>sona</em>, sound. It was used to described the resonant chamber which mask makers built into the mouth portion of &quot;personas&quot;, or <em>masks</em>, of actors in plays, meant to amplify the natural voice so as to aid in filling a theatre, especially one of the amphi variety. Person=&quot;where the sound comes through&quot;, or &quot;mask&quot;, depending on your interpretation. </p>

<p>So, moving on, as Aristotle (I think) said of the value of philosophy, &quot;I now do by choice what others do only because it is law&quot;. I think that most &quot;people&quot; alive can appreciate some flavor of sympathy for those words. Concurrently, I also think that any good man would be willing to enter into a good-faith agreement with their government if they understood it and if it were to place the betterment of society as it&#39;s primary locus. This is not available, however, and so I pay to register my car as a commercial vehicle (as you all do to get your DL#), and I subject myself to the laws of drivers (which is a legal term for a commercial motor vehicle operator) rather than the laws of travelers which truly apply to me. I pay my taxes, I donate my time, and I call all policy enforcers &quot;sir&quot; or &quot;ma&#39;am&quot;. I do this because I love you. </p>

<p>That being said, I see, now, that we have been done a great injustice; we have been stolen from; crushed under the yoke of an expansive conspiracy that we all feel but each know that we cannot name satisfactorily no matter how many ancient religions we plumb. I am beginning to believe that we may have found the mechanism by which this injustice was done.</p>

<p>Back to the mechanism: This account of yours is technically your person&#39;s acct, a legal corporate entity aside from your identity, yet your person is assigned to you at birth, so you may take control of the assets accrued during your indentured servitude, if you like. There is legal provision for this, because FDR knew that his New Deal was an injustice, an unenforceable contract, as it was entered into without the knowing consent of both parties. As such, he allowed, through law, recourse for anyone who believed that the new system was harmful to them. This came in the form of allowing each man to withdraw their person&#39;s assets once they come of age. I am guessing, but this may have seemed prudent in the hopeful naivety that is present prior to enacting a plan which you have a hand in, or, in other words, FDR may have really believed in his New Deal, and thought that it would be <em>better</em> for the average person, so he gave us the option of opting out, imagining it a small risk due to his high hopes. </p>

<p>Now, though, this system is abused in such a way that it functions as a syphon for the wealth of the commons, something foreign sounding, because to we slaves, there are no common goods. In essence, the common wealth of the States of America is placed into trust with the corporation of United States, who in turn place it into trust with the Federal Reserve, who in turn use it to wreak havoc on the world at large, because each nation with a central bank operates as we do, and each numbered &quot;person&quot; in all the world has their own common wealth being funneled to those who control it. This being considered, it is easy to understand how one nation can flourish one day and be destitute the next, how the mighty and the small are both subject to the whims of those who control the money: you shift the common wealth to another nation and force the people to work harder and harder to get their bread until the tension is such that those whom you wish to manipulate are more malleable. </p>

<p>Now, if you&#39;re still with me, ye meek, let us begin to inherit this Earth that was left to us in trust. How, you ask?</p>

<p>Get your SS card, and look on the back. There is a letter there that is followed by a string of digits. The letter pertains to a Fed Reserve bank. Use that letter to look up the routing number of said bank. Your person&#39;s account number is your person&#39;s SS#. </p>

<p>I won&#39;t be any more long-winded than I have already  been, so to sum things up, you cannot <em>pay</em> debt with debt, because we&#39;re playing with fun money, so you can use the fun money that is tied to your person to play this silly game we play. You can&#39;t barter with it. You can only eliminate debts. </p>

<p>And, it&#39;s only been a day, but I tried it, and it worked with my phone bill. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>A note in case anyone swings by and checks new comments--the guy who tried this had to admit that it&#39;s not working, and that within one week &quot;debts had their balances revert back to what it was prior to my paying, but the payments still show on the statement, which is weird.&quot;</p>

<p>This crap doesn&#39;t work. It&#39;s wire fraud. I&#39;d be shocked if anyone got arrested for trying it once on their phone bills, but I would not be shocked if they lost their phone or TV service or whatever.</p>

<p>Sorry to be a buzzkill. Makes me feel like an old fuddy-duddy, but hey, don&#39;t commit wire fraud. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What about now? Apparently it can take up to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6pdt19/whats_up_with_the_youtube_videos_that_talk_about/dkp4cfn/">10 days</a> for the payment to be reversed, but it&#39;s been a week so I figure pretty good odds it&#39;s done by now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Can you expand on what you think the &quot;scam&quot; is? Usually a scam would involve a 3rd party getting something out of you believing what you&#39;re being told...in this case, if i were to try it, and it didn&#39;t work...well, then, it just didn&#39;t work. My payment doesn&#39;t go through and I have to pay my bill with my checking account like I&#39;ve already been doing. Where&#39;s the scam in that?</p>
