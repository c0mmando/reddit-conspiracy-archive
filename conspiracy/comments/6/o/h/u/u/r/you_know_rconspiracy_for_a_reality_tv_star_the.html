       Everytime something about Donald Trump drops there's a new accusation bordering on conspiracy from the Trump camp. Then r/conspiracy gets a million Clinton is a murderer posts as well as the narrative that MSM is lies and cannot be trusted therefore only giving credibility to those who believe every word out of Trump's mouth.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's multiple comments in posts about "Hey the shills are here brigading" when it's obvious the shills are the one who upvoted the post in the first place since none of them can defend their accusation in the comments. Everything is meant to be taken at face value for reactionary purposes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just saying for a reality T.V star... he ceretainly seems to have some well organized highly reactionary defensive propaganda at the ready nearly at all times.

       Nope, just old enough to have been able to watch DJT's actions for decades and recognize him for what he is; an opportunist.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look at his history, he's an opportunist of the First Order and it's how he's built his business empire.  Did anyone really think it would be different if he ever got into the WH?
      </p>
      <p>
       He says what his base wants to hear and will deliver on a portion of it, but he'll never deliver on even half of what he's promised.
      </p>
      <p>
       The primary thing he's delivering on, though, is the anger and divisiveness that is tearing our Country apart.  The real question is, who benefits from this?
