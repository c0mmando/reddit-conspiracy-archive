        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I consider myself a progressive and a left-wing populist with ideas that take elements from Rawlsian liberalism, social democracy, intersectional feminism, anarcho-capitalism, and pirate politics. </p>

<p>And yet within the Canadian lefts, I mostly see people who are &quot;go-along-to-get-along&quot; with the corrupt Liberal Party establishment, people who can&#39;t look past Donald Trump and Rob Ford (both shit stains on the underwear of the human race, admittedly) when they hear the word &quot;populism&quot;, and refuse to consider CIA and deep state conspiracies. </p>

<p>I feel like nobody prominent within the &quot;mainstream&quot; lefts seem to get &quot;it&quot; right save for Bolivian President Evo Morales and former Minnesota governor Jesse Ventura, admittedly two men who are otherwise very different both philosophically and culturally. </p>

<p>Meanwhile, so-called &quot;liberals&quot; and &quot;social democrats&quot; are often just as quick to give the Al-Saud Crime Family a free pass as are right-wingers, UK Labour&#39;s grassroots allowed Opus Dei (I&#39;m Catholic, but I am relatively irreligious and I am not socially conservative) and the neoconservative PNACers (ie the Bush/Cheney/Rumsfeld/Clinton creeps) to hijack their party for years via fifth columnists such as Tony Blair and Ruth Kelly, &quot;social democratic&quot; and Stalinist factions in Venezuela assisted the CIA and the corporate lamestream media in their failed 2002 attempt to depose the country&#39;s democratically-elected government, Canada&#39;s NDP elects a leader that had previously been regarded as being on the right-wing fringe of the neoliberal Parti Libéral du Québec, and we&#39;ve wasted trillions of dollars and millions of civilian and military lives destabilizing secular Arab regimes that, good or bad, had nothing whatsoever to do with 9/11, thus concentrating regional power in the Middle East in the far-right clerical establishments running, Riyadh, Ankara, and Tehran, creating power vacuums that have been filled by Daesh (&quot;ISIS&quot;), and manufacturing waves of otherwise-unneeded refugee crises in Europe, the Americas, and Oceania.</p>

<p>A majority of Iranians are either liberal or socialist in their world view and have been for decades, and yet they are somehow unable to dislodge the extremist clerical establishment that has provided us with an incredible amount of fear porn from the wackos running Likud and the GOP. </p>

<p>It&#39;s obvious to me that the deep state has murdered or otherwise-silenced real opposition leaders such as Jacob Arbenz, Mohammed Mossadegh, Sukarno, Patrice Lumumba, Martin Luther King Jr, Salvador Allende, Oscar Romero, and Paul Wellstone. Sometimes it feels as though even having controlled opposition within our political class is a luxury at this point. </p>

<p>There is reason to suspect that the cancers that killed Hugo Chavez (2012) and Jack Layton (2011) at around the same time that they infected other progressive leaders in the Americas were orchestrated from Washington, but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s something that can be proven. </p>

<p>Everyone just loves Franklin Roosevelt, who seems to have been beatified by many American progressives, but to me he was a miserable excuse of a bigot who allied with White supremacists and perpetuated Jim Crow when he had a mandate to liberate Dixie from the Bourbon reactionaries, he worked with corporate interests to create racist moral panics among the ignorant that led to the idiotic outlawing of cannabis and hemp (But hey, he ended Prohibition. It&#39;s all good!), he interned and seized the assets of hundreds of thousands of patriotic Americans based solely on their ethnicity and on the national origin of their ancestors, and he established the special relationship between Washington and the Al-Saud Wahhabi Mafia that has inflicted untold suffering upon hundreds of millions in the Middle East and the Global South, particularly women, religious minorities, and those not born into money and privilege. </p>

<p>And rather than getting any traction out of these arguments, the reaction that I seem to get from everyone is to say my prayers, take my vitamins, and smile, wave, and just play dumb for corrupt, duplicitous losers such as Justin Trudeau and Hillary Clinton. </p>

<p>I get thrown in with the actual rubes, that is the anti-vaxxers, the Holocaust deniers, the gun nuts, and the far-right militias, and I have no idea how to fire a gun more powerful than a fucking Super Soaker. At &quot;worst&quot;, I&#39;m open to the Mandela Effect and the existence of extraterrestrials on Earth. </p>

<p>Am I the crazy one here, or are my fellow &quot;progressives&quot; just blind, deaf, and willfully ignorant to the reality around us? </p>
