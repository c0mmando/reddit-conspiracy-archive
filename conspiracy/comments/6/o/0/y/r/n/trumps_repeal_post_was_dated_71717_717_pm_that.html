        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><ul>
<li><p>On the day of his inauguration, Trump was exactly 70 years, 7 months, and 7 days old. He was sworn in by Justice Roberts, 7 letters each. </p></li>
<li><p>This Congress is the 115th Congress (1+1+5 = 7). </p></li>
<li><p>Netenyahu was in office 7 years, 7 months, and 7 days when Trump won the election on November 8th. </p></li>
<li><p>Trump and Pence&#39;s birthdays are 7 days apart. </p></li>
<li><p>Pence was 57 years and 7 months and 14 days (7+7) old during his first day in office. </p></li>
<li><p>Trump has 7 members of his family. </p></li>
<li><p>Melania is 7 letters. </p></li>
<li><p>Pence was governor of Indiana, which is 7 letters. </p></li>
<li><p>Gorsuch is 7 letters. Gorsuch was nominated after he had written 777 judicial opinions on the Hebrew calendar year of 5777. Gorsuch is 49 years old (7x7). Gorsuch was confirmed on Trump&#39;s 77th day in office. Supreme Justice are both 7 letters. He was sworn in by Kennedy and Roberts, both 7 letters. His investiture ceremony was on Trump&#39;s 147th day in office and the picture of Gorsuch and Trump alone has a clock in the background was at 1:47 PM. </p></li>
<li><p>Also, there will be a total solar eclipse on Trump&#39;s 7th month in office. 7 years later on Trump&#39;s last year in office, there will be another total solar eclipse, the 21st (7+7+7) one since 1776. They both converge on the state Illinois, which is the 7th state both eclipses pass over if you play them in reverse. Illinois is the state of Abraham Lincoln, 7 letters each, Ulysses, 7 letters, and Obama (whose legacy will be eclipsed twice by Trump). </p></li>
<li><p>Trump&#39;s tweet about repealing Obamacare yesterday was on 7/17/17 at 7:17PM PST. In 24hr time it was 22:17. If you add the non-7 numbers of the date together, you get 1+1+2+2+1 = 7. If you add 7+17+2017 you get 2041, which is the year Barron Trump turns 35, which is the age required to run for POTUS. 2041 also adds up to 7. </p></li>
<li><p>Baron Trump&#39;s Marvelous Underground Adventure&#39; is 45 characters long and Trump is POTUS 45 and published by Charles Johnson, 7 letters each. </p></li>
<li><p>&#39;1900; Or, the Last President&#39; is 28 characters long, or 7+7+7+7. </p></li>
<li><p>&#39;The Travels and Adventures of Little Baron Trump and His Wonderful Dog Bulgar&#39; is 77 characters long and published by Wharton Edwards, 7 letters each. Their author, Ingersoll Lockwood is 17 letters and was born in 1841 (1+8+4+1 = 14 = 7+7). </p></li>
<li><p>If you add the dates of the two books that mention Baron Trump (1890+1893 = 3+7+8+3 = 21 = 7+7+7).ï»¿</p></li>
