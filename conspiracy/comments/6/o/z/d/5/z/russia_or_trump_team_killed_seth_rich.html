        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I know this will fall on deaf ears because conspiracy theory aficionados seem to be Trump supporters, but I&#39;m looking for some quick input because I cannot find this theory anywhere. It&#39;s generally accepted Seth Rich was the one leaking DNC and Podesta emails to Wikileaks, correct? Now try to suspend any ideological or political bias when reading or conceptualizing this. </p>

<p>The Steele dossier (pissgate) is generally considered to be nonsense because of its outrageous material. Trump staying in a Russia in a president suite having hookers pissing on a bed in which Obama was scheduled to stay in. But the dossier also contains very specific and choreographed information. A lot of information about Russia using business dealings and sexual deviancy to black mail Trump. </p>

<p>There&#39;s a page of the dossier that appears to be incomplete but mentions moles within the DNC. Report 95 of the dossier makes this claim &quot;There was an agreed exchange of information established in both directions. Trumps team using moles within DNC and hackers in the US as well as outside in Russia. Putin motivated by fear and hatred of Hillary Clinton. Russians receiving Intel from Trumps team on Russia oligarchs and their families.&quot;</p>

<p>The part about moles within the DNC intrigued me, because as stated before Seth Rich is generally considered to be the DNC leaker. Could it be possible Seth Rich was the Trump mole within the DNC, and after he completed his duty Trump or the Russians had him killed in fear of him regretting his decision and confessing? This is a nefarious accusation obviously, but Putin is known to kill journalists, political opponents, and possible whistle-blowers. </p>

<p>But the accusation against Trumps team killing Seth Rich is a new one, as far as I know. Seth Rich seemed to be a strange character, always draping himself in the American flag. Democrats and left wingers in general are not known to be outwardly nationalistic, so maybe Seth Richs allegiance wasn&#39;t to the DNC but to Trump? Maybe Seth Rich was so pissed off at the DNC for rigging the democratic primary against him, he wanted to help Trump defeat them? Maybe he was blackmailed? </p>

<p>I have no clue why he&#39;d leak DNC emails to Wikileaks, but again it&#39;s the generally accepted theory. Can anyone help me rationalize this? Trump supporters, please suspend your ideological and political beliefs for a second. The Steele dossier is strangely accusatory and contains very dark information about a possible Trumpâ€”Russia connection. It isn&#39;t generally accepted to be true, but as time goes on it seems more information within it becomes more plausible. This is a huge accusation, Trump team possibly resulting to murder to cover their tracks, but Seth Rich was the leaker and if the Steele dossier is remotely true the way it were moles within the DNC. Seth Rich could have been a Trump aligned mole, and Trumps team or the Russians had him killed because he was volatile. Anyone have some input?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t find it hard to believe the Hillary campaign and the DNC had moles. </p>

<p>Seth Rich&#39;s death did not become a big issue until well after the election. </p>

<p>There was other strange stuff, like that just before the New Hampshire primary, data problem, along with the Nevada fight among other  doings along the way that tarred Hillary and sometimes Sanders.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If Rich was a Trump mole, I think it&#39;s more likely he was discovered and whacked by the DNC.  At the time, Trump hadn&#39;t even won the election, so if he were going to kill him, wouldn&#39;t he do it closer to the election night?  Also, even if he regretted and snitched, I&#39;m not sure if the revelation would have made a dent.  It would have been denied left and right.</p>

<p>If Trump/RNC has killed anyone, I think it would be that NYT reporter that was recently found dead.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Very very interesting about that reporter being found dead, with cause of death unknown thus far. I haven&#39;t heard of this story and it just happened 2 days ago. This is exactly what happens in Russia, journalists and political operatives just die in strange ways. Not trying to connect dots that aren&#39;t there, but this guy was clearly anti Trump and wrote a piece comparing Trumps administration to 1984.</p>

<p>There&#39;s also been other strange deaths surrounding the DNC, like Shawn Lucas a 27 year old DNC employee who was suing Debbie Wascherman Schultz(sp). Another interesting death is UN diplomat John Ashe who died in August 2016 supposedly due to a weightlifting accident, and he was set to testify against Hillary Clinton at some point in the future. It seems these are obviously Clinton murders especially when fake conspiracy sites pump out accusations that the Clintons murdered these guys. Maybe Russia has been trying to frame Hillary and the DNC and create fake news buzz about possible Clinton murders? There was a GOP operative who supposedly committed suicide early in July who was seeking Hillary emails from Russia. </p>

<p>These strange deaths are going to keep occurring, and this is exactly what happens in Russia. </p>

<p>Consider Michael Hastings, which is one of many, many journalists over the years:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I had completely forgotten about the DNC cleaning house. It&#39;s hard to find reliable sources of moles within the DNC, but the story I see being passed around through a Google search is Sanders campaign had moles within itself who were reporting back to the DNC/Clinton campaign. Maybe it&#39;s possible Seth Rich was upset with the DNC rigging the primary against Bernie he worked with Trump? I don&#39;t know, it sounds insane but I did find a Dailymail article of a GOP lobbyist accusing Russia of killing Seth Rich.</p>

<p>I severely doubt the legitimacy of this, but the narrative is out there to some extent. This GOP operative appealed to Congress to present evidence of Russia killing Seth Rich. It could be nonsense but we have no clue what kind of information Mueller and Congress have on this Trump Russia situation. This story differs from him in that the GOP operative claims Russia killed Seth Rich after he discovered Russia hacked the DNC. But the details could be off, maybe Seth Rich thought he was doing a good thing when he leaked but showed regret. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Again, being against liberal arguments or the actions of the DNC, doesn&#39;t make me conservative nor pro-Trump. I stand by both parts of my statement. Keep digging through my history and you&#39;ll probably see me argue a bunch of things you agree with too.</p>

<p>I feel the goal should be to try and remove politics from your posts as much as possible. The only times I even discuss it is with someone who already brought politics into the conversation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A proper investigation into the murder of Seth Rich would be interesting, and I&#39;m surprised Trump hasn&#39;t called for one yet. He&#39;s called for an investigation into voter fraud and Hillarys emails, but I don&#39;t think he&#39;s even commented on this. I think it&#39;s interesting Trumps team is completely silent on the Seth Rich issue. I also think it&#39;s interesting Wikileaks and the official Russian Embassy Twitter both tweeted about Seth Rich once and never again, both around the same time. I&#39;m not trying to jump to conclusions here, but in a world where the Steele dossier is true it wouldn&#39;t be hard to imagine Russia and Wikileaks are blackmailing Trump over the murder of Seth Rich. These tweets from the Russian Embassy and Wikileaks came the day before Trumps inauguration, January 19th. A possible message to Trump? Follow our orders or everything will released? </p>
