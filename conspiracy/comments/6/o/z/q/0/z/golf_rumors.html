&quot;Golf rumors rundown
Okay so at the PGA tournament 2009, a politico journalist apparently attended some after party and discovered occult shit happening in basement, not just your normal larping satanist wannabes but some truly sick shit. She posted a story about it, which was immediately taken down, presumably after the powers at be threatened her. There was more chatter than they were comfortable with in online golf forums (which are now deleted) and a few days after the Tiger Woods sex scandal was posted by National Enquirer. 
Tiger Woods ruined his image to bury this story, there was more info on it on some onion site but I can&#39;t seem to find it. 
All surface web traces of it have been wiped outside of threads like this. 
Goes deeper than most know.&quot;</p>

<p>Apperantly connected to the death of Erica blasberg, it seems everyone&#39;s afraid to talk about it on boards. I&#39;ve been able to find a few summaries simmar to this spanning across multiple boards although that&#39;s it.</p>

<p><a href="http://imgur.com/ldPp0ZJ">Earl Woods was deeply involved with the military</a> </p>

<p>Aside from that, do some deeper digging on Earl&#39;s military and personal connections. Specifically those linked to Laurel Canyon. </p>
