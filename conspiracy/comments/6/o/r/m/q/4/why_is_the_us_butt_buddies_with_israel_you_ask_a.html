       Washington DC was founded in 1871 by the organic act of congress.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where did the District of Columbia name came from?
      </p>
      <p>
       "Columbia" is a name for "Goddess of Creation, War, and Destruction" more known as the goddess of death and pain. She is derived from the imagery of Semiramis, wife of Nimrod, and Queen of Babylon.
      </p>
      <p>
       columbine (n.)
c. 1300, from Old French columbine "columbine," or directly from Medieval Latin columbina, from Late Latin columbina "verbena," fem. of Latin columbinus, literally "dove-like," from columba "dove." The inverted flower supposedly resembles a cluster of five doves. Also a fem. proper name; in Italian comedy, the name of the mistress of Harlequin.
      </p>
      <p>
       The statue on top of the Capitol building called the Statue of Freedom is actually Persephone, meaning “She who Destroys the Light”. She is the queen of the underworld. She is crowned with pentacles (pentagrams--stars with five points). When someone stands on something, it is usually an indication of ownership. Therefore, she owns the facility she stands upon.
      </p>
      <p>
       Columbia and Persephone are seen as other statues around the Washington D.C. area.
      </p>
      <p>
       The U.S. Constitution provided for a federal district under the exclusive jurisdiction of the Congress and the District is therefore not a part of any state.
      </p>
      <p>
       1788 Original Constitution for the united states, original organic, of the people government.
      </p>
      <p>
       1871 Amended version CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES,US is now a private corporation.
      </p>
      <p>
       "An Act To Provide A Government for the District of Columbia." This is also known as the "Act of 1871." What does this mean? Well, it means that Congress, under no constitutional authority to do so, created a separate form of government for the District of Columbia, which is a ten mile square parcel of land.
      </p>
      <p>
       What??? How could they do that? Moreover, WHY would they do that? To explain, let's look at the circumstances of those days. The Act of 1871 was passed at a vulnerable time in America. Our nation was essentially bankrupt — weakened and financially depleted in the aftermath of the Civil War. The Civil War itself was nothing more than a calculated "front" for some pretty fancy footwork by corporate backroom players. It was a strategic maneuver by European interests (the international bankers) who were intent upon gaining a stranglehold on the neck (and the coffers) of America.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Congress realized our country was in dire financial straits, so they cut a deal with the international bankers — (in those days, the Rothschilds of London were dipping their fingers into everyone's pie) thereby incurring a DEBT to said bankers. If we think about banks, we know they do not just lend us money out of the goodness of their hearts. A bank will not do anything for you unless it is entirely in their best interest to do so. There has to be some sort of collateral or some string attached which puts you and me (the borrower) into a subservient position. This was true back in 1871 as well. The conniving international bankers were not about to lend our floundering nation any money without some serious stipulations. So, they devised a brilliant way of getting their foot in the door of the United States (a prize they had coveted for some time, but had been unable to grasp thanks to our Founding Fathers, who despised them and held them in check), and thus, the Act of 1871 was passed.
      </p>
      <p>
       In essence, this Act formed the corporation known as THE UNITED STATES. Note the capitalization, because it is important. This corporation, owned by foreign interests, moved right in and shoved the original "organic" version of the Constitution into a dusty corner. With the "Act of 1871," our Constitution was defaced in the sense that the title was block-capitalized and the word "for" was changed to the word "of" in the title. The original Constitution drafted by the Founding Fathers, was written in this manner:
      </p>
      <p>
       "The Constitution for the united states of America".
      </p>
      <p>
       The UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, in all capitals, represents a fictitous corporation. Your birth certificate, drivers license, SSN, bank statements, are all written in capital letters, which means you have registered(Registered means Crown), submitted and/or applied to be a part of the UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, corporation as a fictitious character.
      </p>
      <p>
       The altered version reads: "THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA". It is the corporate constitution. It is NOT the same document you might think it is. The corporate constitution operates in an economic capacity and has been used to fool the People into thinking it is the same parchment that governs the Republic. It absolutely is not.
      </p>
      <p>
       Capitalization — an insignificant change? Not when one is referring to the context of a legal document, it isn't. Such minor alterations have had major impacts on each subsequent generation born in this country. What the Congress did with the passage of the Act of 1871 was create an entirely new document, a constitution for the government of the District of Columbia. The kind of government THEY created was a corporation. The new, altered Constitution serves as the constitution of the corporation, and not that of America.
      </p>
      <p>
       Think about that for a moment.....................
      </p>
      <p>
       If you will remember back in 1999, Clinton (a lawyer) got in front of the federal grand jury and argued what the definition of the word "Is" is.. Even small words have great meanings.
      </p>

       By 1773, competiting lodges in France created the Grand Orient. When, the Jesuits couldn’t defeat the Protestants by military means, they focused on infilitration. One tactic was colonization. Roman Catholic George Calvert or Lord Baltimore created a Catholic colony in Maryland. The Jesuit John Carroll was probably the richest man in America in the late 1700’s.
      </p>
      <p>
       Carroll allowed funding to construct D.C. (which is nicknamed “Rome on the Potomac”). In fact, Wikipedia and the Catholic Encyclopedia confirm Washington D.C.’s original name as Rome, Maryland. Also, a branch of the Potomac River was called “Tiber”, which is named after a river in Rome. This information was written in the 1902 edition of the Catholic Encyclopedia under the article on John Carroll.
The owner of the land used to be Francis Pope and his priest was Jesuit Andrew White. Like Rome, Washington D.C. has 7 hills (whose names are Capital Hill, Meridian Hill, Floral Hills, Forest Hills Hillbrook, Hillcrest, and Knox Hill). Is this a coincidence? It doesn’t look like one to me. Roman Catholic John Carroll suggested that French architect Pierre-Charles L’Enfant to design D.C. A freeborn African American named Benjamin Bannaker also was apart of astronomy and architecture during that time. It’s said that Benjamin had a role in its construction.
      </p>
      <p>
       It’s a fact that Roman Catholic Charles Carroll was a signer of the Declaration of Independence. The Carroll family (who were run by the Pope plus the Jesuits of Rome) and the Freemasons were key in the American Revolution. John Carroll founded Georgetown University in 1789. Daniel Carroll owned land in D.C. Roman Catholic Pierre L’Enfant was apart of the creation of Washington D.C. as well. Roman Catholic Constantino Brumidi was the hired painter of occult pictures in the Capitol Dome.

       Some other interesting notes:
      </p>
      <p>
       There seem to be many factoids around the holocaust that are not true. 6million jews did not die at the holocaust. That was all propaganda.
