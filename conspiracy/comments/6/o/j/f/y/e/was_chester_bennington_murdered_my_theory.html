       Go read lennonmurdertruth.com, does he sound crazy? Well that's how you sound

       It's scary to see someone connecting all these dots that to them reveals some secret truth, but to everyone else it's a bunch of random dots...

       Totally unrelated to his death or "pizza gate" though; that's really funny what gene Simmons said to him, what a fucking weirdo.. his whole family is goons

       The accused pedophiles or rather, speculated pedophiles, NEED NO SPECIAL CONSIDERATION. Most adults like you and I, don't behave or associate in ways that can look like an innapropriate underage sexual deviance . In fact the average adult would feel very uncomfortable even giving a hint of a pedo-impression even once vis-a-vis poorly chosen words or inadequate explanation. So it seems fairly certain that if someone's activities are inviting the speculation of pedophilia..they probably are involved in it. Consider multiple behaviors, statements, personal emails containing proofs, and social cliques/venue and it's laughable to pretend otherwise. NOT TO SPECULATE IS DANGEROUS FOR SOCIETY as wolves only run unchecked for so long. Also, exactly which celebrity, politician, or mover and shaker have you seen with a life ruined due to pedo speculation? Certainly no one in those groups lately or for that matter ever, so shove that b.s. over sympathetic theory into your plugged up ear and maybe it will rattle your brain to think better for everyone around you (yeah this means you: people afraid to accuse the pedophiles for fear of ruining their lives).  I'm pretty sure if your behaving in ways etc. that makes others notice you may be a molester or whatever then your life is probably already ruined to it's rotten apple core.

       In my opinion there are too many coincidences that this whole thing could be marked as coincidence. Just do your own research, the Podesta mails got leaked,

        a retired head of FBI also said that pedophile rings are a thing

       Why would you say that the whole theory is dumb when MK Ultra was a thing. I'm 99% sure that you're not able to talk about this in a friendly manner, prove me otherwise.
