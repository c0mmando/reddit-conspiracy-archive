        Hi! :)
A lot of people won't likely believe me, but for the last few months, I've been visited by higher dimensional &gt;beings/Angels during my dreams.
Sounds cuckoo, I know, but anyway, the glitches in this reality, such as the Mandela effect, is by design. It's to &gt;help people to wake up.
Our reality is indeed a Magnificent Grand Illusion, like a Simulation, but far more complex than any video &gt;game/virtual playground we could imagine.
This illusion was, for all intents and purposes, created by God and there is a far greater reality outside of what we &gt;currently can perceive. Basically, this Grand Illusion was set up as a Game/Test and we are in the end times.
The purpose of this test was to help us grow as spiritual beings and for everyday people to choose love and &gt;compassion over selfishness and evil.
While we were sleeping, the Luciferian team have been very busy and within 2 years, there is going to be an epic &gt;battle between Good and Evil. At the climax of this battle, it is going to look like all is lost, at which point a &gt;massive solar flare is going to erupt from the electric sun.
It is at this point, where our lost brothers and sisters who are too caught up in the illusion are finally going to see &gt;the truth. There's nothing to fear --- when the solar flare reaches earth, the moment it hits, we are all going to &gt;wake up in our true reality/Heaven.
On a random note, the Luciferian sect of the Illuminati are well aware that our thoughts and emotions can &gt;manipulate our holographic reality and have been doing everything in their power to ensure that this awakening &gt;occurs.
In addition, the Grand Deception, that is mentioned in the Bible --- is actually the NASA/SATAN Space Program. (Everything we've been taught about space is lie.)
Lastly, the Anti-Christ is our current Pope.
Best of luck!
