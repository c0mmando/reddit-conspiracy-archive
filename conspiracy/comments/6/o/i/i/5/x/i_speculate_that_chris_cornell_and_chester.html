        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>There are some fans of Cornell who do not buy the autopsy ruling that he committed suicide. Instead, some fans claimed the death scene photos from his hotel room prove the rocker was murdered. Cornell was apparently about to expose a child sex ring that involved A-list Hollywood stars and elite politicians. That’s the alleged reason who was murdered, some claim.</p>

<p>Chester Bennington, Cornell&#39;s son&#39;s godfather tweeted this in May: “As of today, my life’s purpose is one of love and understanding. The world needs to change and that change comes from within. Hate, pride, vengeance and fear are the plague of the earth. Love, kindness, compassion, empathy and service to others are the cure.”</p>

<p>He adds a challenge to his followers on Twitter, “Let’s all choose to be a part of the cure. If we look outside ourselves to find love and peace we will ultimately fail. It has to come from within. Lead by example.&quot; </p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t seem like anybody who says that would commit suicide two months later, but these are just my speculations.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was reading a random Instagram post and just learned of Chester&#39;s passing/&quot;suicide&quot;. I&#39;m pretty plugged into Pop Culture and I never heard about his death until now? So that immediately got me suspicious. So I looked up how he died, and that turned out to be even more suspicious. Funnily enough I did a Google search with his name and &quot;autoerotic&quot;, thinking that the reason all the reports are so vague is because they wanted to protect his dignity...and then search results with him (Chester) and Chris came up together. Now I also had the same feeling about Chris&#39;s death (just didn&#39;t feel right), not because of my &quot;guy feeling&quot; but because the media didn&#39;t report on these deaths in the usual way they do about other celebrity deaths. That woman who acted with Scott Baio had more coverage than these two legends...very odd.
And now I read that Chris was Chester&#39;s son Godfather? Something is amiss.</p>
