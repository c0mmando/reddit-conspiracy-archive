       Can we agree that this is the bottom line and this is what we are going to have to do?
      </p>
      <p>
       Most of the DC scumbags need to be flushed out not by the laws that they made (which only serve them) but with the common law that we can all agree on. It's incredibly obvious that most of us can't stand these people so it would be appropriate if we just fired them without having to file lengthy impeachment paperwork which will never get us anywhere since they themselves review this paperwork. We just need to go up there and verbally bark at them until they get the hell out of DC using circus protests.
      </p>
      <p>
       Circus Protests are:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         Permanent protests (until the mission is accomplished)
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Protest that are put up in front of various locations (banks, city halls, DC, ect..)
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Protestors have to clown politicians as they come in and out of the building to make life as unbearable as possible.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Phone cams should record the whole thing and upload via live feed so that all can see what the protestors are doing and can be motivated to repeat the behavior.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       There's really no choice at this point because if they keep funneling our money out of the economy, we will eventually end up like Mexico or Venezuela. The Federal Reserve even has their paws on our gold for "safe keeping." ;)
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, we may as well stop paying taxes (sales tax, income tax, payroll tax, ect..) and throw debt bills from large organizations like banks or loan departments into the garbage. They stole from us so all we are doing is using our available options to get our own money back into the economy. If we keep feeding the beast, it will keep growing so ending taxes and debts is a must.
