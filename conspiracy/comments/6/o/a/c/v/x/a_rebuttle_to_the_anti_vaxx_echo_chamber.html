        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I know this post will be downvoted to infinity. One is not allowed to challenge the anti-vaxx crusade anywhere, but esp here. The irony of conspiracy board shouting down the otherside of the argument...</p>

<p>No other conspiracy theory discussed here is dangerous and will literally kill people.</p>

<p>Not a single anti vaxxer is unvaccinated for the diseases they claim are better to have around than the vaccines that prevent them. Not a single one has ever had the diseases. They speak from the vantage point of safe ignorance.</p>

<p>Not a single anti vaxxer has witnessed the diseases they so cavalierly dismiss, diseases as serious as polio. Presumably they would object to the small pox vaccine too had it not been eradicated and vaccination for it retired. Small pox is the disease from which the word vaccine derives fwiw. I&#39;ve yet to meet an anti vaxxer who knows that. </p>

<p>Not a single anti vaxxer has attempted to prove their argument by exposing themselves or their children to diseases for which they are not vaccinated.</p>

<p>The anti vaxx contingent here and around the web is extremely well coordinated, in a way only surpassed by Trump and Clinton and Russia brigades.</p>

<p>It is less controversal for devout christians and atheists to argue with each other here than it is for anti vaxxers and people who fear epidemics.</p>

<p>Rob Schiender, the new hero of this board, gets echo chamber threads hundreds of posts long and is held in higher regard than than people like Gary Webb. The shame of that fact should shut this board down. </p>

<p>The age of disease is already knocking on our door now with regard to antibiotics. I&#39;ve yet to meet an anti vaxxer who argues that the demise of antibiotics is a good thing. This is because almost every single one of them has needed them at some point in their lives and witnessed others that have as well. The reason they have needed them is because their are no vaccines for bacterial infections, vaccines only prevent viruses. Many anti vaxxers, however, argue that vaccines are unnecessary because the diseases they prevent were cured by public health initiatives. Public health initives did lower disease rates...bacterial disease rates. They had almost no effect on viruses. </p>

<p>The only effective measures to prevent viral infection besides vaccines are covering your mouth and nose, washing your hands, mosiquito and other pest eradication, and avoiding the sick. Basically, you are at the mercy of the thoughtfulness of sick strangers. Most sick strangers are assholes.</p>

<p>Vaccines are over 200 years old. Does capitalism corrupt their quality and distribution? Yes. Is this because Big Pharma gives a shit about you? No. It is because the only motive that any profit seeking corporation has is ROI and increased profits. Cutting corners is seco d only to worker exploitation in increasing profit margins.</p>

<p>If you believe that the illuminati are on the verge of culling the herd, the easiest and cheapest way for them to do that is via disease for which a vaccine exists that can keep them safe while killing everyone else. However, the high esteem for vaccines puts a hitch in that plan, so to move forward they would need to (1) make people afraid of vaccines, (2) deligitmize vaccines, and (3) use high profile people to preach not getting kids vaccinated. And they would need to do all three relentlessly, in a well coordinated effort. </p>

<p>If you want to wipe out humanity, releasing small pox on the now worldwide virgine population, would do it, while vaccinces protect those doing the releasing. To combat a small pox outbreak, vaccination would have to be in the tens of thousands 24/7...but if everyone refuses the vaccine...who knows, we all love game conspuracies, maybe WHO&#39;s erradication profram was to create a virgin population for the cull...</p>
