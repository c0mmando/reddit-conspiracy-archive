       You're also being misled by agenda driven fact check sites.
I'll lay out all sourcing and connections, and you'll see the Clintons were quite involved with players listed in the investigative commision into Petrocarbide.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here is an official document that discloses the Commissions investigation into Petrocarbide and the allegations involved.
       <a href="https://docs.google.com/viewerng/viewer?url=http://omegaworldnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/senator-Latortue-Report.pdf">
        https://docs.google.com/viewerng/viewer?url=http://omegaworldnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/senator-Latortue-Report.pdf
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       There is an allegation against Mirlande Manigat, who was backed, supported, and propped up by the Clinton Foundation. She is accused of accepting millions in donations, for this fund which large portions never made it into the petrocarbide fund.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://cepr.net/blogs/haiti-relief-and-reconstruction-watch/clinton-emails-reveal-behind-the-doors-actions-of-private-sector-and-us-embassy-in-haiti-elections">

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Another suspect is Sophia Martelly who formed a board with Bill Clinton who managed many corporate deals involved in the re-construction of Haiti.
      </p>

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Another Alleged suspect that was going to come into the commission's questions was Salim Succar, who is known to have extremely close and personal ties with Clinton and was seen lounging with him after being disgraced from his position after the earthquake and has been under scrutiny for helping prop a dictator and providing cover for the illegal movement of funds. Such as the mismatch of Petrocarbide donations to how many they received, and the every growing coffers of the clinton foundation.

      </p>
      <p>
       And here is Jean Max Bellerive who was set to testify regarding claims of kickbacks and unfair business practices while PM. He also has strong ties to clintons who supported him, and he oversaw the implementation of the Clinton Foundation in Haiti.

      </p>
      <p>
       There is another alleged by the name of thierry mayard paul , who is a government cabinent member of haiti and an ex presidential hopeful. There are no specific actions regarding his alleged involvement, however he is referenced multiple times by haiti investigators and believe he is a key person of interest and his name springs up frequently in many of the illegitimate transactions.
