        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The Gay Report, published by homosexual researchers Jay and Young in 1979, revealed that 73 percent of homosexuals surveyed had at some time had sex with boys 16 to 19 years of age or younger.5 (5. K. Jay and A. Young, The Gay Report (New York: Summit Books, 1979), p. 275. ) </p>

<p>Although homosexuals account for less than two percent of the population. they constitute about a third of child molesters.6 (6. K. Freund and R.I. Watson, &quot;The Proportions of Heterosexual and Homosexual Pedophiles Among Sex Offenders Against Children: An Exploratory Study,&quot; Journal of Sex and Marital Therapy 18 (Spring 1992): 3443, cited in &quot;The Problem of Pedophilia,&quot; op. cit. Also, K. Freund and R.I. Watson, &quot;Pedophilia and Heterosexuality vs. Homosexuality,&quot; Journal of Sex and Marital Therapy 10 (Fall 1984): 197, cited in NARTH Fact Sheet. ) Further, as noted by the Encino, Calif.-based National Association for research and Therapy of Homosexuality (NARTH), &quot;since homosexual pedophiles victimize far more children than do heterosexual pedophiles, it is estimated that approximately 80 percent or pedophile victims are boys who have been molested by adultmales.7 (7. Thomas Schmidt, Straight and Narrow? Compassion and Clarity in the Homosexuality Debate (Downers Grove, IU.: Intervarsity Press), p. 114, cited in &quot;The Problem of Pedophilia, op. cit., p. 2. ) </p>

<p>A nationwide investigation of child molestation in the Boy Scouts from 1971 to 1991 revealed that more than 2,000 boys reported molestations by adult Scout leaders. (Note: The Scouts, who have 150,000 Scoutmasters and assistant Scoutmasters, ban hundreds of men each year from scouting out of concern that they might abuse boys.)8 (8. Patrick Boyle, Scout&#39;s Honor (Rocklin, Calif.: Prima Publishing, 1994), p. 3l6. ) </p>

<p>A study of Canadian pedophiles has shown that 30 percent of those studied admitted to having engaged In homosexual acts as adults, and 91 percent of the molesters of non-familial boys admitted to no lifetime sexual contact other than homosexual.9 (9. W. L. Marshall, et al., &quot;Early onset and deviant sexuality in child molesters,&quot; Journal of interpersonal Violence 6 (1991): 323-336, cited in &quot;Pedophilia: The Part of Homosexuality They Don&#39;t Want You to see,&quot; Colorado for Family Values Report, Vol. 14, March 1994. ) </p>

<p>Judith A. Reisman, Ph.D., and Charles B. Johnson, Ph.D., conducted a content study of the personal ads in the Advocate, the national gay and lesbian newsmagazine and discovered that &quot;chickens,&quot; a common term for underage boys sought for sex, were widely solicited. Many of the advertisements in the magazine solicited boys and teens from within a larger pool of prostitution ads.10 (10. Judith A. Reisman, Ph.D., &quot;A Content Analysis of &#39;The Advocate,&quot;&#39; unpublished manuscript p. 18, quoted in &quot;Pedophilia: The Part of Homosexuality They Don&#39;t WantYou to See,&quot; ibid. ) The authors also note a statement from a book review by homosexual activist Larry Kramer that the work, &quot;like much canonized male homosexual literature, involves sexually predatory white men on the prowl for dark-skinned boys to gratify them.11 (11. From &quot;Lany Kramer&#39;s Reading List,&quot; The Advocate, January 24, 1995, p. 99, cited in &quot;Status Report,&quot; The Reisman &amp; Johnson Report of Partner Solicitation Characteristics as a Reflection of More Sexual Orientation and the Threat to Children, First Principles Press, January l995.)
In a 1985 study of the rates of molestation among homosexual pederasts compared to heterosexu1 pedophiles, Dr. Paul Cameron found the following:</p>

<p>153 pederasts had sexually molested 22,981 boys over an average period of 22 years. </p>

<p>224 pedophiles had molested 4,435 girls over an average period of 18 years. </p>

<p>The average pederast molested an average of 150 boys, and each heterosexual pedophile molested an average of 20 girls, a ratio of 7.5 to one. 12 (12. Dr. Paul Cameron, “Homosexual Molestation of Children/Sexual Interaction of Teacher and Pupil,” Psychological Reports 57 (1985): 1227-1236.)</p>
