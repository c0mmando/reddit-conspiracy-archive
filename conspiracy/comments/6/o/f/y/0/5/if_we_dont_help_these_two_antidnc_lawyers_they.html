       Jared and Elizabeth Beck are the married lawyers suing the DNC in a civil case to get back monetary donations that were used to steal the primary from Bernie Sanders.
      </p>
      <p>
       Currenty, these two are uncovering how the evil doings of powerful people are likely linked to murders of people related to the case. It quite possibly involves illegal organ donations done through Mayo Clinic Hospitals. They are receiving threats on the phone, with one scary phone call that had a caller ID which was traced back to the offices of former DNC head, Debbie Wasserman Schultz.
      </p>
      <p>
       If no one helps them they will die together in a "tragic car accident" before mid-September, 2017. In this case, "the powers that be" won't be able to get away with an unlikely murder-suicide scenario so a car accident will have to do.
      </p>
      <p>
       The other possibility is that the case is quietly settled out of court in August and we never hear from the couple again.

        Watching the interview clip, you may feel like you are watching a new type of found-footage horror movie, i.e. the interview scene where the victim realizes on camera that she is about to be murdered.
       </strong>
       It is sad and horrifying.

       Did that happen? I am not sure, I was not there. I will admit that what probably saved their lives was the fact they the judge quashed their case on technical grounds. The JUDGE made a legal JUDGEMENT against their case, so maybe the DNC decided that another two murders were unnecessary.

       I am happy I was wrong and that they they are safe. Are you disappointed they we're not murdered, if so you need to reassess your character, i.e. you are an asshole.

Check your facts.
There are people dying. Anyone investigating and many, many children. Those are facts.
Who is killing them and who is doing the trafficking?
Why is it all connected to the Clinton cabal?

       Why would comcast censor the internet? Wouldn't they lose customers and money?
"give up freedom and security in order to protect freedom and security."
Understand the patriot act. Give up freedom for promised security.
Give up freedom for promised fair and fast internet access.
It's always about giving up freedoms and handing power to the government in order for them to do something, which they say is positive.
I don't trust them any more. Sorry. If the government wants power the default answer is no.
Additionaly the very fact this 'net neutrality' topic is so big on Reddit front page makes it extra fishy. The way they manipulate algorithms and votes, censor the populist voice and were pushing Hillary Clinton and every other establishment narrative of the corporate media.
The corrupt establishment, our enemies, evidently want this law. Having lost control of the internet and the narrative.
And now they want to help us out with a nice innocuos law that will provide better browsing experience?
Do you really buy that? 
Reddit, heavily influenced by Share Blue shills and formerly CTR, has basicaly banished all conservative/ populist voices from reaching all. Anything that callenges the mainstream. But it wants 'net neutrality'? Because it feels like they want even more control.
