<p>So, I recently finished reading <a href="http://centerforaninformedamerica.com/moondoggie/">Wagging the moondoggie</a>, and it reignited my interest in the landings, and whether they were faked or not.</p>

<p>So, I&#39;ve made a &#39;&#39;for and against&#39;&#39; &#39;list&#39; over why they were real, contra faked. Let me know what you guys think.</p>

<p>The moon landings were faked, because:</p>

<ul>
<li>It happened in the same decade in which JFK was assassinated, which <em>should</em> make anyone doubting the warren commissions findings skeptical, to say the least.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-nasa-tapes-idUSTRE56F5MK20090716">Apparently</a>, NASA lost all of the original footage of Niel and Buzz on the moon, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GtCvZlXeVk">yet here it is..</a>.</li>
<li>The Russian spaceprogram was leagues ahead of the american, with the Russian cosmonauts having <a href="http://centerforaninformedamerica.com/moondoggie-1/">clocked 5 times as much</a> time in space as their american counterparts. (if info doesnt show on link, ctrl + f that shit)</li>
<li>All they really had to do was to build a huge ass rocket, keep in orbit for the duration (which, considering 60&#39;s tech, is a huge feat in itself) and land the module with the astronauts, having enjoyed a small holiday in LEO. Everybody would be able to say <em>&#39;&#39;yall the rocket, it was HUGE! Why would launch such a rocket, if not to go to the moon?</em> Well...</li>
<li>It was a distraction from escalations in the Vietnam war.</li>
<li>We never went back. </li>
</ul>

<p>The moon landings are real, because:</p>

<ul>
<li>We have video proof.</li>
<li>Nasa says so.</li>
<li>The Russians says so.</li>
<li>Buzz punched a guy.</li>
<li>The TV says so.</li>
<li>They <em>did</em> actually make the huge ass rocket, and actually several. All launched perfectly (except for one). Really impressive regardless of perspective.</li>
<li>Buzz put a reflector thingy on the moon we can bounce lasers off. That&#39;s pretty convincing.</li>
<li>Other Nations have landed rovers, probes on the moon. If they can, then why couldn&#39;t Nasa?</li>
</ul>

<p>Really looking forward to your responses, thoughts and what not. I like to &#39;believe&#39; that we did it, because <em>yay, humanity!</em> and all that, but since I do not trust the US government, it just makes it a hard pill to swallow.</p>
