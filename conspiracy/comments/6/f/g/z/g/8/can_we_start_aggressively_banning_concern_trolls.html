       I'm sick and fucking tired of seeing "this sub is full of T_D (cucks//pedes//losers//whatever)"
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: I'm sick of all concern trolling, but I'm realllllyyyy getting tired of seeing "This sub (some words + negative adjectives) T_D (more words + negative adjectives)" as the top reply to the top comment on all the top posts.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regardless of whether or not that statement is true it doesn't serve this community in any way.  All it does is foment negative opinions about this sub (which I believe to be one of the last great ancient subs of reddit (although it is on life support)) and distract from real conversation.  It is nothing more than concern trolling and we should be dealing with it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know about the real users out there (fuck you paid propagandists), but I have never found a sub full of more diverse-thinking yet respectful people on the internet.  If you have a problem with the content of the sub, create better, more compelling, more investigative, more truth-revealing content.  Don't troll the people here about how the content isn't that good.
      </p>
      <p>
       Full disclosure: I fucking hate Donald Trump and corruption.

       100% valid criticism and I'm not sure why I'm okay with this but not other censorship.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think I don't really count this as censorship because it's not really censoring anything.  No ideas are being censored.  If we were trying to have a discussion, and this one guy just wouldn't stop screaming "YOURE ALL STUPID" as loud as he could constantly and we threatened to kick him out if he wouldn't stop are we censoring him?
      </p>
      <p>
       Regardless, rule 5 says no trolling so it's not like I'm asking for MOAR censorship, just that the current rules be actually enforced.

       link on
       <a href="/r/all">

       (thanks new system!) and of the first few comments I see half are "This is putin's sub" or "T_D retards at it again" and I'm just shaking.  This type of "guilt and discredit" by association bullshit is straight from the CIA (NSA? don't remember exactly) handbook on how to delegitimize grassroots movements.  Find a group that everyone hates (T_D), associate thing that everyone doesn't hate (
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       ) w/ thing that everyone hates, tada everyone hates both things.  I'm seeing it happen here and I think we should take steps to stop it.

       Honestly I just downvote it and move on. Maybe call it out in the comments.

       Also another strategy is to post more interesting stuff so those dumb posts get ignored.

       Downvoting doesn't work when they have a bot army that will keep them at +60 regardless of what we, the people, do.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe the concern trolls ARE the shills.  Or at least some of them.  It's really impossible to know who is and isn't a shill, which is why I like this approach of limiting their arsenal.  (Concern trolling is 100% a weapon they are trained how to use)

       The shills have taken over. No way around that. The comments supporting the mainstream narrative are upvoted and any comment that disagrees is brigaded. I rarely bother to post anymore unless it's late weekend nights anymore. I agree that concern trolling should be a rule 10 for attacking this sub at this point. No other way to combat it.

       It's not even constructive.  Even if it IS true, what difference does it make? If they make retarded pro-trump posts or deny facts just point out how their post is bullshit and that facts are facts.  This isn't a goddamn meme sub where someone is going to post something and then everyone just spams L E T T E R S in an L shape.

       Yeah... I had some dude saying I was a regular on T_D because some addon for RES incorrectly told him I was a regular there... so in a lot of cases they aren't even checking your account... they are just going along with some nebulous list of "bad guy" circulated by... I dunno... I guess they must think they are the good guys.

       maybe we could just have auto delete of any post that mentions trump, comey, clinton, et al.
      </p>
      <p>
       the front page might as well be CNN. its exhausting. it is excellerating the calcification of our pineal glands and interfereing with the coming enlightened state of being that one poster keeps promising us is coming any day now.
      </p>
      <p>
       what is going on in DC  right now is not a conspiracy, it is a pissing match. 97% of the l'affaire du trump posts here are just news of the day you can find anywhere. even if the post were to say it has been conclusively proven that those involved are reptillians, i wouldn't fucking care at this point.
      </p>
      <p>
       i'm starting to believe the whole purpose of the incessant l'affaire du trump everywhere you turn is the real conspiracy. the goal is to so beat down the citizenry with this absurdity that we completely tune out for good about everything.
      </p>
      <p>
       the internet made everyone pay attention to everything, which is bad for the evil-doers' business, so they decided if you can't beat 'em, join 'em and are making such a cacophony now that people are on the verge of insanity.
      </p>
      <p>
       the only people I've found who still give a shit about any of this are boomers who only are exposed in the hours they watch tv between whatever fucking boring as PBS murder mystery show they watch religiously. everyone else i know is like, "i can't take it anymore, shut the fuck up. i don't fucking care anymore. fuck them all. they're all POS, including bernie sanders."
      </p>
      <p>
       last night i found myself whistfully recalling the days when rick rolling could always bring a smile and the whole purpose of myspace was just fucking around and posting siezure inducing gifs and music. good times. good times.
      </p>
      <p>
       fwiw, i'd add putin to the autoban, but he talks about conspiracies, so an outright auto delete would be too broad a brush, putin+trump would get the desired result.
