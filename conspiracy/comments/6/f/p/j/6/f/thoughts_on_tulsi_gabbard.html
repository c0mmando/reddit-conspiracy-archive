       So far, she isn't getting quite the treatment she should be getting if she were actually opposed to the PTB.
       <br/>
       You need only look at Ron Paul to see how they actually treat their opposition.
       <br/>
       Plus the clean packaging is definitely setting off alarm bells. Fearless, attractive Hawaiian surfer girl? Feels like the work of the people that brought us Obama &amp; Trudeau.

       Ditto, and that's one of the things that worries me.
       <br/>
       Also, I think there is a noteworthy physical resemblance between her and the Israeli actress they chose to play Wonder Woman. They both have military backgrounds too.

       That doesn't change anything about the resemblance point I was making. You can pretend I didn't mention here nationality if it helps.
       <br/>
       I only mentioned it because it's always worth mentioning that someone is Israeli (because of Israel's power).

       No, it doesn't. Both have similar physical appearance and both have military background. Where the actress is from and where she got the military background is irrelevant to the point making; the point that clearly cannot be conveyed to you now that her nationality has been mentioned.

       I think we should all assume  by now that you don't get into the political spotlight unless someone wants you to be there, and in the end, they are part of the same system. I agree there may be honest politicians, but they aren't the famous ones.

       Completely lacking any credibility but I can't help but think that the new series of House of Cards is foreshadowing.
      </p>
      <p>
       They have already covered election fraud via CIA and Social Media manipulation (which we saw) and are now covering how an election is effectively halted due to terrorism then manipulated to keep the same president in that was definitely losing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bearing in mind when this (and Homeland which cuts close to the bone with sock accounts, private contractors manipulating social media debates etc) are actually filmed, I find it really interesting.

       My bet is on : very close if not assumed winner, then an event will take place to stretch the constitution in favour of Trump somehow manipulating a second term. I have zero credibility other than my silly belief that House of Cards is foreshadowing such an event.

       Keep in mind that Killary nearly won even though she was virtually universally hated. Even the vast majority of her own supporters hated her and were just trying to keep Drumpf out of office.
       <br/>
       The 3+ years of
       <em>
        girl power
       </em>
       conditioning that was deployed to get Killary elected is still in effect. This country is primed to elect a female president. An attractive, likable 'anti-establishment' woman like Tulsi would win effortlessly.
       <br/>
       Assuming some serious foul play/manipulation (such as that which you just mentioned) doesn't occur.
       <br/>
       I'll check out some episodes of
       <em>
        House of Cards
       </em>

       Its the latest series of both House of Cards and Homeland that might be worth a look.
      </p>
      <p>
       I agree she 'nearly' won, but did she really 'nearly' win. I don't know, because it is now impossible to trust any data we are given by the media or government. I think we will see something similar i the UK in the next week or so with their General Election also.
      </p>

       I agree that the SJW's are desperate for a female leader. Again, it will be interesting to see if the UK retains theirs.

       She's with the good guys. Nobody can point to anything she says or does and say otherwise. All of the criticisms I see repeated are grasping. CFR included.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also know for a fact that she has gotten positive ET contact (Pleiadians) as Putin has, and is aware of major changes that will transpire in the near future, regarding Earth's liberation from the Cabal.

       All I know is that many world leaders have already been given full disclosure, even shown the crashed spacecraft in Antarctica. She is among several that has direct contact with Pleiadians because she will be involved in the new government after the Event (solar pulse).
      </p>
      <p>
       People have different levels of understanding, but basically there are millions of non-terrestrial souls incarnated into human bodies. Many people in this sub are ET souls and won't realize it until after the shift happens (the Event).
      </p>
      <p>
       There are many people in every system of government waiting for the precise moment of compression breakthrough, and at that time there will be mass arrests and the banks will close for up to 2 weeks. When everything comes back online there will be new plans put into place, and a release of hidden technologies. Disclosure is happening now very slowly, but then we will be given the complete story of our history and ET involvement on the planet.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some white hats are having telepathic contact, and some are having face to face contact. Pleiadians are 5D, and vibrate at a higher frequency than humans can usually perceive, but are also able to manifest into physical bodies to speak with world leaders.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am also incarnated Pleiadian and I am one of many here to spread the word. Contact is happening all over the world right now and will eventually become more out in the open. Both myself and my mother have Pleiadian 'guides' who speak with us on many subjects in detail.

       The Galactic Federation is monitoring everything happening in the world very closely. They are always helping in unseen ways.
      </p>
      <p>
       All of us have guides, sometime from our own soul family. A large percentage of the population is non-terrestrial incarnation, and I would say a huge part of the subreddit is of this group. We are the first to awaken from the 3D false-matrix. Everything will become apparent once we make the complete shift in consciousness to 5D, which is already happening. This means the loss of all illusion, and polarity of opposites, which keeps us from seeing that everything is connected.
      </p>
      <p>
       The best thing anyone can do to further contact with their own Guides or positive ETs is to live a high vibrational lifestyle... live with integrity every day, love yourself and others, eat healthy foods and drink clean water, meditate.
      </p>
      <p>
       Messages from higher dimensional beings can sound like your own thoughts but with focus and practice these voices can become more distinct. We are all 'channeling' all the time, especially through creative activities. There are many legit channelings on youtube with messages that apply to all of us.
      </p>
      <p>
       After the Event, there will finally be open contact, and one by one the star races will arrive and introduce themselves. We will all get to meet our ET families. The Pleiadians will be first since they look like Earth humans, and people will be less likely to be afraid.

       So why fuck with her? If she can't talk shit about the people who have ruined her beloved "Hawaii", then fuck her. We need bold, strong people to head "The Mob". Gabbard don't cut it. She can be bought. Our "mob" is going to be comprised of the brightest, the bravest and the best who cannot be bought or bribed.

       My personal opinion is it's definitely an Obama/Trudeau situation. Likely groomed and raised to be a person we expect to give us change. Seems she was raised in a very strange cult which fires off some alarm bells. Very much an Obama type situation, bottom link has a very strange video of her.

       Both links make it very clear that her religion is not Hinduism but a cult derived from it.
      </p>
      <p>
       The second link is written by someone excommunicated from the cult
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        I only want to expose this cult for what it is. To me it is a disgrace to call it Hinduism as I was never taught about Hinduism being raised in this cult. I was never educated at all being raised in this mind control cult.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I know what Hinduism is and that is not it. As far as I am concerned, no man is an idol that should be worshipped and bowed down to. I understand guru's are important for others to get acquainted with the spiritual world, but seeing children bow down to that creepy guy and making fun of Christianity makes me uneasy.

       He said many things that you'd think only an anti-establishment person would say, and made promises you'd think only an anti-establishment person would make.
