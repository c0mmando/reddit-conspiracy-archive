<p><strong>2)</strong> The Shadow Brokers hackers. </p>

<p><em>The U.S. government reportedly has still not developed full confidence on the identity of the &quot;Shadow Brokers&quot; hackers.</em> <strong><em>Suspicion has fallen on the Russian government, but in October the FBI arrested a Maryland man who worked for Booz Allen Hamilton</em></strong> <em>and had previously worked at the NSA’s Tailored Access Operations, a unit that carries out hacking operations around the world to obtain foreign intelligence on spies, terrorists and other targets. The firm’s former employee, Harold T. Martin III, has been charged with theft of government property and violating the Espionage Act by retaining classified material. He pleaded not guilty in February and awaits trial.</em> <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/hospitals-across-england-report-it-failure-amid-suspected-major-cyber-attack/2017/05/12/84e3dc5e-3723-11e7-b373-418f6849a004_story.html?utm_term=.8387f912d540">https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/hospitals-across-england-report-it-failure-amid-suspected-major-cyber-attack/2017/05/12/84e3dc5e-3723-11e7-b373-418f6849a004_story.html?utm_term=.8387f912d540</a> </p>

<p>Examples of scaremongering:</p>

<p><em>Bruce Schneier, a leading authority on state-sponsored breaches: “The question is why would someone steal it in 2013 and release it this week? That’s what is making people think this is likely the work of Russian intelligence.”</em></p>

<p><em>James A. Lewis, a computer expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington think tank: “This is probably some Russian mind game, down to the bogus accent”</em> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/17/us/shadow-brokers-leak-raises-alarming-question-was-the-nsa-hacked.html?_r=0">https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/17/us/shadow-brokers-leak-raises-alarming-question-was-the-nsa-hacked.html?_r=0</a></p>

<p><em>The leak is the latest and, according to security experts, the most damaging set of stolen documents published by the Shadow Brokers, which is widely believed to be tied to the Russian government....This suggests the document dump could be a retaliation by Russia</em> <a href="http://fortune.com/2017/04/14/microsoft-shadow-brokers/">http://fortune.com/2017/04/14/microsoft-shadow-brokers/</a></p>

<p><strong>3)</strong> &quot;Russians penetrated US Electrical grid.&quot; </p>

<p><em>So the key scary claim of the Post story — that Russian hackers had penetrated the U.S. electric grid — was false. All the alarmist tough-guy statements issued by political officials who believed the Post’s claim were based on fiction.</em></p>

<p><em>Even worse, there is zero evidence that Russian hackers were even responsible for the implanting of this malware on this single laptop. The fact that malware is “Russian-made” does not mean that only Russians can use it; indeed, like a lot of malware, it can be purchased (as Jeffrey Carr has pointed out in the DNC hacking context, assuming that Russian-made malware must have been used by Russians is as irrational as finding a Russian-made Kalishnikov AKM rifle at a crime scene and assuming the killer must be Russian).</em> <a href="https://theintercept.com/2016/12/31/russia-hysteria-infects-washpost-again-false-story-about-hacking-u-s-electric-grid/">https://theintercept.com/2016/12/31/russia-hysteria-infects-washpost-again-false-story-about-hacking-u-s-electric-grid/</a></p>
