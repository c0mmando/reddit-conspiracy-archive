        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Inspired after reading <a href="/u/everything_at_will">/u/everything_at_will</a>&#39;s thread: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/holofractal/comments/6ekhda/has_anyone_else_made_this_connection_before_carl/">Has anyone else made this connection before? (Carl Sagan&#39;s 4D / Crop Circles)</a></p>

<p>In Carl Sagan&#39;s Flatland, he explains that a two dimensional creature living in a two dimension world cannot perceive three dimensions. A three dimensional object passing through Flatland would only appear to the two dimensional creature (in Sagan&#39;s example, Mr. Square) as a cross section at the point it travelled through. (Source: <a href="https://youtu.be/N0WjV6MmCyM?t=2m14s">https://youtu.be/N0WjV6MmCyM?t=2m14s</a>)</p>

<p>He shows that a 3D cube casts a 2D shadow that is a distortion of its true self. This distortion, Sagan says, is the penalty for a higher dimensional entity appearing in a lower dimension. This distortion between dimensions can be shown by casting a light on a see through cube, such as one made of plastic or plexiglass, and observing the shadow it casts on a 2D surface. The cube in three dimensions is made up of all right angles and straight lines. In two dimensions, the shadow is made up of more angles and the lengths are not equal.  </p>

<p>I think one interesting potential consequence of us living inside multiple dimensions is that we could be immortal in a higher dimension.</p>

<p>When Sagan explains that a 2D creature walks along a 3D plane that they will eventually come back to their starting point. However, the length to them appears linearly. (Source: <a href="https://youtu.be/N0WjV6MmCyM?t=437">https://youtu.be/N0WjV6MmCyM?t=437</a>)</p>

<p>Let&#39;s say that the 4th dimension is measured in time. Something pretty commonly accepted. Time appears linearly to us. We are born. We age.  We die. We have no knowledge or perception of our existence before we were born or of the afterlife. Except that people have allegedly gotten glimpses of past lives or had prophetic visions of the future. Suspending skepticism for a moment and postulating that these experiences are authentic, what if they glimpsed the apple passing through flatland? </p>

<p>What if we are not able to perceive time as it truly is? If time is the fourth dimension, and Sagan&#39;s idea of distortion between levels of dimensions holds true, then we will only perceive time through distorted manifestations of itself. These distorted manifestations could possibly be experienced as dreams, hallucinations from psychoactive drugs, out-of-body experiences, astral projection, ghosts, and other unexplained phenomena. Time may also manifest itself physically in our world through sacred geometry, patterns, and synchronicity, attempting to communicate to us that which we cannot perceive.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s imagine for a moment that we are living in multiple dimensions. We know that we human beings are physically in the third dimension. We experience length, width, and depth. We can travel across spherical objects like our Earth knowing that if we travel in a straight line, eventually we will reach our starting point. In other words, we grasp the concepts of 3D objects in a way that 2D beings would not. We are similar to our two dimensional friends from Flatland however, in that it is easy for us to assume we are walking on a flat path. Indeed, even our early ancestors believed our world to be flat at first. It was not until our understanding of our own dimension increased that we were able to perceive it more accurately.</p>

<p>In a sense, we could consider ourselves halfway between two and three dimensional beings before we discovered the Earth was spherical. Now, I think we are halfway between a third and fourth dimensional existence. With Time being the fourth dimension. Currently, we can only perceive time on a very limited basis. Right now it appears flat and one directional. We cannot experience time as anything other than linear. We cannot travel back and forth in time, we can only proceed forward. Also, we cannot control our speed through time like we can control our speed through three dimensions. Indeed, we are not travelling through time of our own free will. The journey is out of our control.</p>

<p>Time, a higher dimension, manifests itself in the third dimension in a distorted manner. As we said earlier, this is the penalty for a higher dimension being perceived from a lower dimension. Time is relativistic. Einstein&#39;s theory of relativity shows that time is perceived to move at different speeds for people that are moving relative to each other or in relation to gravitational masses. That means that time is affected by massive three dimensional objects such as planets, stars, black holes, and other celestial bodies. Except, in a way that we are not able to fully perceive.</p>

<p>Our understanding of time and the fourth dimension has greatly increased as we have been able to travel to the stars. The higher our perspective goes, the more we are able to understand our physical universe in three dimensions. We have observed that time travels at different speeds based on where the observers are in relation to one another. Time for astronauts moves slower than it does for those on Earth. Also, celestial events we are witnessing in the sky today happened thousands of years ago, but are only now visible because of the speed of light.</p>

<p>We have found that 2D beings travelling in a straight line on a 3D object will eventually reach their starting point. What if the same is true for 3D beings travelling in a straight line on a fourth dimensional object? What if time is cyclical the same way a sphere is spherical, except we three dimensional humans are unable to perceive it in its true state?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>another thing, i thought i had read that if we travel the speed of sound, (maybe it was light, idr) that time slows down? if that&#39;s the case, doesn&#39;t seem like it could be the 4th dimension since we can experience that, unless it&#39;s the speed of light? this is really interesting and again thank you for sharing</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think that if time is cyclical life could potentially repeat, however I don&#39;t think it would be a perfect loop where everything repeats itself identically as it did in the past. Events will change based on what occurs. We may see the same type of events occur repeatedly, but they would be changed since they are still affected by everything that has already occurred.</p>

<p>If the universe is made up of vibrations, then let us try to imagine the universe as a pool of water. When we drop a single stone in the water, its vibrations or waves emanate out and reflect off the edges of the pool. That reflect back into one another and this causes vibrational interference. In other words, the event of the rock hitting the water, a singular event, continues to affect future events, the reflecting waves until eventually equilibrium is reached.</p>

<p>Now, instead of a 2 dimensional pool, what happens if you had a spherical ball of water suspended in a vacuum. If you were to drop a rock into the sphere where there were no walls to reflect back the waves, then eventually the wave would interfere with itself. So, in both scenarios, one singular event affects future events, in multiple dimensions.</p>

<p>Now, take our model and make the pool of water our universe, and imagine each person, and each atom, and each particle that makes up everything as the rocks in the pool. Is it so hard to imagine that the butterfly&#39;s wing flap can cause such an exaggerated event as a typhoon a world away?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You read correctly, that is explained by the theory of relativity. Time moves at different rates for different people based on where they are in relation to other people and other massive gravitational altering objects. This is why time moves slower for astronauts in regards to people on Earth. Time is being distorted based on the astronauts increased velocity in orbit, and the gravitational fields caused by other large celestial objects (planets, stars, etc).</p>

<p>I&#39;m arguing that we are experiencing the 4th dimension, but in a way that we don&#39;t realize the full reality of what is going on. We are only seeing time manifest in a distorted version of what it truly is. We eventually may come to understand it more fully and perceive it more clearly, and I think its evident that this is already happening. Humanity moving from a earth-centric model of the universe, to a sun-centric model of the universe I think shows our expanded understanding. I just think we have a long way to go.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Something should be able to, which is why we have proposed FTL particles and CTC theory.  We aren&#39;t really all that sturdy compared to other 3 dimensional things, so it would be pretty cocky for us to assume that people would be the thing that could move about time freely.</p>

<p>We can manipulate time though by speeding things up or shooting them out of the reach of gravity.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I also agree that some things should be able to traverse time as well, so it is awesome to know that there could very well be some particles that do this.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think people will be able to move through time physically. But I do hope that eventually we may begin to traverse it using other parts of our consciousness or manipulate it. I also think it is a very good possibility that some of our ancestors did know how to do this.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t know that I would say we can manipulate time though, I&#39;d like to discuss this more. If we are speeding things up and making them experience time on a faster scale than we are, are we actually manipulating time itself? Or merely our observation of what we perceive as time? Can we prove that from the perspective of the particle that was sped up/slowed down that it felt the change in time?</p>

<p>I will have to look more into the FTL particles and CTC theory as I haven&#39;t read about those yet.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good stuff here. I use the flatland analogy a lot when talking about higher dimensional beings in relation to us in 3rd density reality. We are all ascending upward in vibration towards a source from which we originated from elsewhere. It is very much a fractal.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I won&#39;t say I believe that we are in a holofractal universe although a lot of evidence points to it. I&#39;m still discovering new bits of information every day. But I do really feel like what you say about us ascending in vibration has some truth to it. </p>

<p>At the sub-molecular level I think everything is vibrating rapidly. If all we are is a collection of frequencies/waves then we should be able to manipulate those waves somehow. By extension we should be able to affect our environment since waves that meet each other cause interference patterns. I think meditation is one method. Sound or acoustical waves being another.</p>

<p>Logically, it would seem if you could find some way to amplify your internal vibration you could affect objects across space and time.</p>

<p>I have a theory that 5th dimensional creatures exist as psychedelics. Or use/create psychedelics for plausible deniability contact.</p>

<p>And look up a disinfo article called opti and I. Its about a hyperdimensional creature who feeds on human thought. Seeding ideas for books and movies as different crops to harvest from.</p>

<p>I haven&#39;t read too much into the 5th dimension yet. I have used psychadelics some years ago, but I don&#39;t recall ever meeting any trans-dimensional beings. Instead I think psychadelics open up our perception a little bit and help us experience the connectivity and fluidity of the universe.</p>

<p>Now, I have heard a little about DMT but have never personally tried it. I have heard of people meeting spirits of plants and of nature. I am not dismissing the existence of transdimensional beings but I just don&#39;t have enough information or evidence to form a concrete opinion yet.</p>

<p>That article Opti and I looks interesting. It reads a little.. schizophrenic? I&#39;ll take a scan, but I&#39;m skeptical of his authenticity.</p>
