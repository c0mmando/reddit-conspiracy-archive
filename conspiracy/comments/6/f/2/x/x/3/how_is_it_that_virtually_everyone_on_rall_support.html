It will either end up at zero or negative.<br/>
How is that even possible?<br/>

How can virtually <em>everyone</em> be in favor of the invasions?<br/>

<p>Marchish 2016 exactly when Reddit started to turn. I&#39;ve been on Reddit (every day sadly) since Nov 2007. Nov 2007-Marchish 2016 was drastically different from Marchish 2016 - now. (Well the past couple of days have actually seemed calm - but maybe b/c I branched out into /new.) I want old Reddit back... I thought for sure it would die down after the election, but it seems like it might have gotten worse...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The individual energy (time, attention, outreach, exposure) expended by mainstream civilians against these wars has proven to be futile (2002-2004&#39;s global protests against the Iraq War... lo and behold, we&#39;re still there). The expenditure of this same individual&#39;s energy source has also proven to be wasted when it is put to devising new economic systems outside of the mass industrialism/ neoliberalism we have today. </p>

<p>Therefore, when one surrenders the efforts for the latter output of energy, one must give in for the invasions. The current economic system NEEDS foreign oil to continue running. If you aren&#39;t working towards creating a new system, then you can&#39;t complain about where the sausage is made. </p>

<p>More of a revitalization of older, tribalistic gift economies. Except without any dedication to luddism. Retrofitting infrastructure with holistic design that incorporates passive energy harvesting technologies with enjoyable human labor. More like art than labor though. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Energy descent. We&#39;re supposedly consuming energy at ratea far beyond what we can hope to sustain. Even renewable and solar energy sources hasn&#39;t slowed down the increase in fossil fuel energy consumption.</p>

<p>I enjoy entertaining the notion that fossil fuels aren&#39;t actually fossils at all and are produced through some kind of geothermal proccess, but that&#39;s really irrelevant. Mostly, I simply find the wanton use of energy distasteful in terms of pollution and distraction from more meaningful human habits.</p>

<p>We could ascend to the stars like an endless plague of Coruscants, but I&#39;d really rather not. It&#39;s apparent to me that we have far more potential to explore the universe with our minds than with our machines. And I kinda like peace and quiet.</p>

<p>If we are to ascend, I&#39;d rather do so psychically than mechanically. I&#39;ve no desire to be a cyborg. I&#39;d much rather be a shaman.</p>

<p>So either, it&#39;s convincing the vast majority of people that lessening their personal material security is better for them to get to the nuts and berries (a near impossible task before your forecasted catastrophe) or creating a new system which offers more material-minded people a reliable abundance of physical goods, which serves as their own personal launchpad into their own infinite potential.

<p>You should re-read what <a href="https://archive.4plebs.org/pol/thread/106680377/#q106687360">High Level Insider said:</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>We have repeatedly encouraged you to embrace what is possible today and contrast it with what is today. Do you comprehend how a space elevator means that <strong>the energy throughput of the economy can be increased by a factor of 10,000 easily?</strong> That that means (given the same population) people have an average income of something like a hundred million dollars a year? This is a radical transformation of the world that we are talking about, the elimination of hungry bellies, a vast expansion in free time, extension of lives. A radically different world is at our fingertips, not out of reach but waiting to be seized. </p>

<p>Well, how then? Note that &quot;space elevator&quot; actually means orbital ring to generate vast amounts of solar derived electricity, coupled with a space elevator for a cheap access to the space.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is frightening. One of their main fallacies in thought is believing that American material wealth and comfort is proof of divine American spiritual ideals, while the truth is closer to American material wealth comes at the expense of our ideals. Once those ideals are hollow, you can justify anything with their corpses. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because after Obama got involved in the Middle East, the liberal perspective on the Middle East destabilization was retconned in a very profound way. Anything &quot;bad&quot; about it could be blamed on Bush, while the liberal hero Obama was given free reign to do whatever he wanted under the umbrella excuse that his predecessors had started the trouble and he was just &quot;cleaning up.&quot; In the eyes of the left, Obama could do no wrong. So when he supported efforts of the Arab Spring to destabilize Egypt, directly intervened in Libya and oversaw the flow of weapons into Syria to take down Assad, it was all justified by the idea that it was for the greater good. Never mind that in doing so his administration essentially paved the way for ISIS and similar radical groups to take a stranglehold on the entire region and gave them, directly or indirectly, billions of dollars of US military weaponry. It&#39;s one of the reasons that the left was so keen on getting Hillary into power - She would have escalated the conflict in Syria like a good little neocon puppet and would have eventually went toe to toe with Russia.</p>
