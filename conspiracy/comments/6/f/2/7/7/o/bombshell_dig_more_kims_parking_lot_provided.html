<p>To reiterate the main points, Kim acted as a data parking lot, if you will.</p>

<p>If you were someone like SCR who had valuable data you needed to anonymously AND securely upload or &quot;dump&quot;, massive amounts of data to, Kim was who you went to. It is on very good authority that many of us would go as far as to imply that Kim&#39;s &quot;parking lot&quot; provided secured tunnels and storage for SEVERAL other wikileaks leakers, including Snowden and Manning.</p>

<p>2.5 weeks ago, we also confirmed SCR completed more than one dump. While Webb is only now leading up what he&#39;s referring to as the &quot;second dump&quot;, sent to Kim via a thumb drive, his reference to it as the second, is incorrect. SCR completed 3 dumps. The first actual &quot;dump&quot;, is what&#39;s being missed.</p>

<p>The first dump was a much smaller data set. SCR was using that smaller capture, as an attempt to put feelers out to confirm to himself that his theories of epiccorruption, were credible and correct. THIS IS WHAT HE INITIALLY REACHED TO WIKILEAKS WITH ABD PROVIDED FOR REVIEW.</p>

<p>Once he&#39;d received confirmation his &quot;gut@ was correct, he proceeded with what&#39;s being considered his first of two dumps... but again, 3 total.</p>

<p>This may seem like a moot point now, but in terms of timeframes and validity to Kim&#39;s claims, it&#39;s not...</p>

<p><strong><em>in fact, it&#39;s actually WHY /pol/ and many other boards, initially had a hard time legitimizing Kim&#39;s initial claims on Twitter that, he was not only &quot;involved&quot; but later, that HE was &quot;the evidence&quot;.</em></strong></p>

<p>ADDENDA 1:
US Capitol lockdown ends after 40 minutes
BY JULIAN HATTEM - 07/08/16 09:12 AM EDT Police ordered a lockdown of the building and the adjacent visitor’s center when they spotted something in an employee’s backpack “that required further investigation,” U.S. Capitol Police said in a statement. The employee was heading to the Capitol through an underground tunnel from the nearby Rayburn House Office Building and appeared to have gone through X-ray machines and security guards at between the two buildings. &gt;<a href="http://thehill.com/policy/national-security/286974-capitol-placed-on-lockdown">http://thehill.com/policy/national-security/286974-capitol-placed-on-lockdown</a></p>

<p>Nope that&#39;s just you promoting those sorts of narratives......nice work attempting to colour/skew the conversation into one disrespectful of Seth Rich tho buddeh. </p>

<p>I think the main gist of the whole line of reasoning supported by this post is that people are horrified a principled young man like Seth Rich could have been murdered by an out of control shadow group within the DNC political structure. </p>

<p>Pretty sure that&#39;s what most here are concerned with and are trying to make sense of amongst the multitude of insidious, incriminating and overwhelming indications of criminal activities (to put it lightly) involving the DNC, the Clintons, Lynch, Pedosta bros. etc.....</p>

    <div class="md"><p>For one, you&#39;re trying to force a black and white answer about something that is complex. Why?</p>

<p>Do <em>you</em> believe that it&#39;s <strong>always</strong> wrong to access someone&#39;s emails, no matter the situation or who that someone is?</p>

<p>By forcing someone to answer yes or no to your question, you have the upper hand regardless of whether it&#39;s yes or no. Either way, you get to act morally superior.</p>

<p>If someone says yes its okay, you get to reply &quot;oh so you&#39;re okay with going through people&#39;s private emails&quot; which puts you in the morally superior position.</p>

<p>If they reply no it&#39;s not okay you not only get to place yourself in the morally superior position again, this time above Seth Rich rather than the person you&#39;re asking but you get to say &quot;why do you support what he did if you believe it&#39;s wrong?&quot;</p>

<p>People can and do think that it&#39;s okay in some situations and not okay in others, and that&#39;s completely normal. Most people don&#39;t sit on one far end of the spectrum, but somewhere in the middle.</p>

<p>Most people who support the leaking of emails think it&#39;s not a bad thing if the emails belong to people like politicians, campaign staff and organizations like the DNC. Those people decide our fate and run our country and if someone has evidence or has seen evidence of possible corruption, or evidence of something that could hurt the American people (or any people really) then we deserve to see that evidence ourselves. Most here would never trust any authorities to show the American people what&#39;s going on.</p>

<p>Obviously, most people in general don&#39;t feel the same way about regular people&#39;s emails, since most people aren&#39;t in high enough positions of power to have an effect on our country or the world. So asking people here &quot;can I see <em>your</em> emails then?&quot; is irrelevant and not a good argument.</p>

<p>Second, I&#39;m curious, do you believe we don&#39;t deserve to know about any evidence of corruption or shadiness because they came from emails? Would it somehow have been better we didn&#39;t find out about Donna Brazile emailing the DNC debate questions? Or all the collusion with journalists and mainstream media networks?</p>

<p>How else do <em>you</em> believe we should find out or learn about these things if not in their communications, private or otherwise?</p>

<p>Do you think they would have told us themselves?</p>
