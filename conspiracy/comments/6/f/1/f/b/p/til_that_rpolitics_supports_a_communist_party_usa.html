        The curious survival of the US Communist Party
       </a>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Like fellow movements around the world, the US Communist Party suffered a crippling blow with the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. But a small group of die-hard members persevered.
       </p>

      <h2>
      </h2>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        During the Cold War the CPUSA had a parallel underground structure, and a
        <strong>
         small number of people spied for Moscow.
        </strong>
        Until the 1980s the party was receiving substantial amounts of Soviet funding, says Klehr, money that the FBI knew about and tracked.

       Great line but it does not work that way and projecting something that is not true bounces off. It may work on others unseasoned people that don't pay attention if that is who you are aiming at which to me it seems you are. But I'm sure you know this!

       Of course you can, that is your right as a citizen of the United States. Preventing you from saying it would be a violation of freedom of speech, and would make me a hypocrite.
But guess what, I hate America. I hate it because it bombed the shit out of my country. And I'm gonna stay on this sub, and lot of other subs, and a lot of other American websites, and there is not a damn thing you can do about it.

       That's not a legitimate reason or we wouldn't be friends with Saudi Arabia and Qatar.

       Additionally the US is only slightly more liberal than Russia - so if that's a good reason to dislike an entire nation then the fact that the USA is the most disliked nation globally makes sense I guess.

       Stop looking at the world as good guys vs. bad guys and you'll be a lot less afraid of half of it. Friendly advice.

       Communists think differently from you. They are not inherently bad people. Capitalists have done plenty of terrible shit as well, but we still let them speak. We can't pretend large groups of people don't exist, though I know the right wing tries to pretty regularly.

       They'll still be out there without that AMA, and you'll know less about them. What's worse?

       Don't let political philosophy define you as an individual.
Ideals are not truth and as such can never be defined as right or wrong.
Argue all you like, but this will never get anywhere.

       That subreddit is a lost cause. It's not at all reflective of what the majority of Redditors think and has been a shill-infested zombie land. It's the mainstream media wolf in a social media sheep's clothing.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's a reason the subreddit's other moniker is
       <a href="/r/redacted">
        /r/redacted
       </a>
       . I've been on Reddit for a good 5 years and I remember when they didn't do things like ban RT, or claim Snowden/Assange was "off topic," or immediately downvote anything pro-Sanders or Paul. What it used to look like was what Voat's news section looks like today. I say this not to plug Voat but to make it clear that politics is astroturfed to the point that it's almost entirely propaganda.

       That's not a legitimate reason or we wouldn't be friends with Saudi Arabia and Qatar.

       Additionally the US is only slightly more liberal than Russia - so if that's a good reason to dislike an entire nation then the fact that the USA is the most disliked nation globally makes sense I guess.
