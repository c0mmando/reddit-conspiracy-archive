    <div class="md"><p>Im very self conscious about my theories. Say the wrong thing and theyll lump you in with flat earthers and anti vaxxers. AKA marked a conspiracy loon which is fine on Reddit and 4chan. But family and friends is a different story. I think the best way to go about it is to only being up the most well sourced theories and bring it up semi casually like &quot;hey so I was researching &quot;blank&quot; and found some pretty weird stuff. You have to build that base of distrust with smaller and easier to swallow theories. But once their on board its all good. I have friends who barely believe in MKULTRA and others who discuss 5th dimensional beings and alien tech with me. Just be thoughtful. You are trying to help people.</p>

<p>What separates the atmosphere of earth from vacuum of space? How is that possible?</p>

<p>How large does mass have to be to initiate gravity?</p>

<p>I&#39;ve looked for the curve.</p>

<p>None found.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve come to the conclusion that the heliocentric model was just another way to get people to worship the old gods.</p>

<p>A catch all by the Vatican for people who won&#39;t yell BUT MUH HOLY BOOK.</p>

<p>A lot of people who wake up to flat earth start thumping Bibles. They don&#39;t realize they went from the new matrix back to the original.</p>

<p>Look into Infinite Plane Society...they are doing good work.</p>

<p>The Flat Earth Society is a gov op controlled opposition. Stay clear if it if you are serious.</p>

<p>Cheers brotha.</p>

<p>A year ago I almost stopped talking to a friend of mine. Thought he was nuts talking about flat earth. Then I tried to debunk it and find the curvature. I couldn&#39;t.</p>

<p>As far as the lit up objects you see in the sky, they are circular. You have no way to tell if they are spheres. I have a telescope myself.</p>

<p>Look at how the moon rotates . Like a cheese wheel over the plane. Interesting we only see one side. </p>

<p>Its not all figured out yet, but one thing is, the physics. With a 20,000 circumference ball, there should be 8 inches per mile squared. Things that should be seen at sea level from large distances, are visible. </p>

<p>Its a shocker for sure.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>*If day and night are caused by the globe&#39;s constant, and even, rotation, towards and away from the sun, then why isn&#39;t half the ball light and half the ball dark for equal lengths? And why isn&#39;t the transition fairly instantaneous?</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The sun is smaller and closer than we&#39;ve been told, as demonstrated by crepuscular rays (the atmosphere&#39;s round shape would actually concentrate light from millions of miles away into a pinpoint, not make it burst into multiple directions), sunspots on the tops of clouds, and it growing smaller, pixel by pixel, in sunsets. </p></li>
<li><p>We&#39;re taught that Mercury and Venus are in between us and the sun, but if we&#39;re facing away from the sun at night, how is it possible to see these &quot;planets&quot; at night with a telescope?</p></li>
<li><p>If we&#39;re really spinning and orbiting the sun, which is also orbiting something else, and Spaceship Earth has been flying in a random direction this whole time, why don&#39;t constellations change? Ursa Major has been referenced as early as Homer&#39;s Odyssey and if you live near the center of our circular plane you&#39;ll be able to see it in the exact same way tonight. And how would it be possible to have such a thing as a &quot;North star&quot;? </p></li>
</ul>

<p>*How is it possible for the Nikon P900 to zoom in on things so far away, particularly at sea level?</p>

<p>*High-altitude footage with a standard lens not only shows a flat horizon, but the horizon always raises to eye level no matter how high you go. There&#39;s no consistency at all with &quot;official&quot; footage. Google Image search &quot;Earth from space&quot; and there&#39;s no consistency between fake CG images, with duplicated clouds and uneven saturation. They&#39;re self-admitted composites, and the only real-real simple photographs we have are from the moon landings which we know were fake; that&#39;s why they were faked. </p>

<p><em>Books debunking heliocentrism were published as late as 1910 and all ancient cultures, which had a pretty good grasp on stars (think pyramids) knew the Earth was a flat motionless *circular</em> plane. </p>

<ul>
<li>&quot;Flat Earth&quot; has been given a negative connotation, by design, so I think it&#39;s better called &quot;Outer Space is a hoax&quot;. Space is constantly faked from the moon landings, to satellites (which went from science fiction to science fact in 2 years, thought-up by a Freemason. There are no shadows of satellites passing over the moon). On several occasions NASA astronauts and Obama said humans can&#39;t go past L.E.O. but we went to the moon 40 years ago? And theres video evidence of NASA using a model of a shuttle that was passed off as real, outer space footage, from the 1980s. </li>
</ul>

<p>*Moutains don&#39;t curve away over long distances, nor do buildings or railroad tracks. </p>

<p>*How does the vacuum of space attach to the non-vacuum of our atmosphere? How do shuttles achieve thrust in a vacuum? </p>

<p>*Airplanes flying out to the horizon don&#39;t follow around the supposed gradual curve but instead diminish in size until they&#39;re out of view. </p>

<p>*The sun and moon appear the same size, think eclipses, because they are the same size, it&#39;s no cosmic coincidence. We&#39;re done giving the benefit of the doubt to proven liars. We&#39;re told moonlight is reflected sunlight, but if the moon were a sphere as we&#39;re also told, then it wouldn&#39;t be so completely full in its reflection back, it wouldn&#39;t have the same reflection on the ocean as the sun, and its properties would be the same as the sun, not different; moonlight lowers temperatures making objects in the shade at night warmer, testable at home with an IR thermometer</p>

<ul>
<li>Seasons are caused on thr flat earth model by the sun rotating closer in Summer  (along the tropic of Cancer) and further away during Winter (along the tropic of Capricorn). What&#39;s the globe explanation? Does it really make any sense? If we&#39;re on opposing sides of the sun every 6 months why dont stars change? </li>
</ul>

<p>There&#39;s tons more but the point is, intelligent design is logical and you dont live on a rotating sphere</p>

<p>Can you show me a video of someone using zoom in order to bring back the <strong>bottom</strong> of a ship/object? All videos that I&#39;ve seen from flat earthers is just someone zooming into a ship that hasn&#39;t gone over the horizon. Hell, <strong>replicate</strong> a double sunset using nothing but zoom.</p>

<p>Speaking of perspective:</p>

<p>Can you explain how the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhNFoy2fAr4">angular size of the Sun doesn&#39;t change over the course of a day?</a></p>

<p>On the equinox, the sun will sets due west and rise due east regardless of your location. How doe perspective explain that observation?</p>

<p>You were the one claiming that the zoom can bring back objects back from the horizon. You gave no evidence, just &quot;perspective.&quot; Do you really not see how the equinox Sun rises/sets disprove that conjecture?</p>

<p>In your edit you claimed that the &quot;stick experiment&quot; (which I assume you meant Eratosthenes) works on a flat earth. <a href="http://itc.gsw.edu/faculty/bcarter/physgeol/egypt/FlatEarth.pdf">It doesn&#39;t at all once you had a third measurement.</a></p>

<p>This, along with the horizon &quot;rises to eye level&quot;, are some of the worst proofs of a flat earth. And yes, what is level to the gravity vector. Your videos don&#39;t prove anything aside that gravity won&#39;t happen on a small mass.</p>

<p>*High-altitude footage with a standard lens not only shows a flat horizon, but the horizon always raises to eye level no matter how high you go. There&#39;s no consistency at all with &quot;official&quot; footage. Google Image search &quot;Earth from space&quot; and there&#39;s no consistency between fake CG images, with duplicated clouds and uneven saturation. They&#39;re self-admitted composites, and the only real-real simple photographs we have are from the moon landings which we know were fake; that&#39;s why they were faked. </p>

<p><em>Books debunking heliocentrism were published as late as 1910 and all ancient cultures, which had a pretty good grasp on stars (think pyramids) knew the Earth was a flat motionless *circular</em> plane. </p>

<ul>
<li>&quot;Flat Earth&quot; has been given a negative connotation, by design, so I think it&#39;s better called &quot;Outer Space is a hoax&quot;. Space is constantly faked from the moon landings, to satellites (which went from science fiction to science fact in 2 years, thought-up by a Freemason. There are no shadows of satellites passing over the moon). On several occasions NASA astronauts and Obama said humans can&#39;t go past L.E.O. but we went to the moon 40 years ago? And theres video evidence of NASA using a model of a shuttle that was passed off as real, outer space footage, from the 1980s. </li>
</ul>

<p>*Moutains don&#39;t curve away over long distances, nor do buildings or railroad tracks. </p>

<p>*How does the vacuum of space attach to the non-vacuum of our atmosphere? How do shuttles achieve thrust in a vacuum? </p>

<p>*Airplanes flying out to the horizon don&#39;t follow around the supposed gradual curve but instead diminish in size until they&#39;re out of view. </p>

<p>*The sun and moon appear the same size, think eclipses, because they are the same size, it&#39;s no cosmic coincidence. We&#39;re done giving the benefit of the doubt to proven liars. We&#39;re told moonlight is reflected sunlight, but if the moon were a sphere as we&#39;re also told, then it wouldn&#39;t be so completely full in its reflection back, it wouldn&#39;t have the same reflection on the ocean as the sun, and its properties would be the same as the sun, not different; moonlight lowers temperatures making objects in the shade at night warmer, testable at home with an IR thermometer</p>

<ul>
<li>Seasons are caused on thr flat earth model by the sun rotating closer in Summer  (along the tropic of Cancer) and further away during Winter (along the tropic of Capricorn). What&#39;s the globe explanation? Does it really make any sense? If we&#39;re on opposing sides of the sun every 6 months why dont stars change? </li>

<p>Earth&#39;s axial tilt.</p>

<p>The earth doesn’t spin perfectly aligned to the sun. Because of this tilt, the part tilted toward the sun will be illuminated longer than the part tilted away. Shine a ling on a ball, as it rotates perfectly vertically. If you raise the light above the ball, the top part will receive longer “days” since it stays in the light longer, and the opposite will happen on the opposite side. If you lower the light, the reverse happens.</p>

<p>Gonna need a source for that claim about multiple directions.</p>

<p>Parallel lines that are slanted towards you <a href="https://ibin.co/2NKPsMZFgJvu">will appear to converge due to perspective.</a> The same way railroad tracks do.

<p>No, the Sun doesn&#39;t shrink in size. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhNFoy2fAr4">Use a solar filter, and take a time lapse of it.</a> If the sun were close we should see not only a change in size, but in apparent speed as well.</p>

<p>Well, because they’re not visible <strong>all</strong> night. It has to be fairly close to sunrise or sun set before either of these objects can be seen at night. There is a reason a planet like Venus is called the evening/morning star.</p>

<p>Look into geometry.</p>

<p>What I love about these claims that &quot;looks flat&quot;, is that some of these weather balloons actually <strong>do</strong> carry fish eye lens. An example being the &quot;little piggy&quot; one which shows distortion if you see the entire footage of the flight, like <a href="http://i.imgur.com/rRCGi8q.png">here.</a></p>

<p>The horizon doesn&#39;t rise to &quot;eye level&quot;. You can actually measure the drop of the horizon using a theodolite. An example being <a href="http://m.imgur.com/iB89TnJ">here.</a> Another one being from a plane like <a href="http://m.imgur.com/cBrTtzR">here.</a></p>

<p>If you, for some reason, don&#39;t trust theodolites then there are other proofs. Such as both the Moon and the horizon <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ha6PeAVLpNo">being below the eye level of an obersver in a plane.</a> Here&#39;s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFj7gNh3yOM">another one.</a></p>

<blockquote>

<p>How much distance is needed for them to turn a single degree? Look it up.</p>

<p>Both the Sun and Moon will vary in size over the year. Look into the different types of eclipses, as well as the Moon&#39;s libration over a month.</p>

<p>The curvature for a 20,000 mile circumference globe is missing. So basically physics.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But how can you know this? I&#39;m not trying to bullshit you here, I&#39;m genuinely curious but from the videos I&#39;ve looked at even right now (just some of the top flat earth videos on youtube trying to prove this, maybe not the best way to get an idea about this theory) are still having issues understanding the data they&#39;re trying to represent. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1KJANfK71A">This video</a> pretty simply explains some of the ways you can represent the Earth&#39;s curvature. The videos supporting flat earth (that I&#39;ve seen) completely miscalculated by either not taking into account a needed variable (such as how high the camera is when taking a photo over the horizon, seen in videos showing that the curvature isn&#39;t there), using the wrong formula, or just numbers that I wasn&#39;t able to reproduce with the given formulas for finding this stuff. </p>

<p>As someone who has done a lot of research on this could you please point me in the right direction for proving this? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>That combined with NASA being caught hoaxing spaceflight leads me to believe the earth is not a spinning ball.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;d also like to see some of this, I&#39;ve seen the videos showing astronauts trying to interact with objects that aren&#39;t there/various other video glitches relating to CGI but haven&#39;t seen anything like this. </p>

<p>I still think it&#39;s a bit of a jump to go from &quot;NASA is dishonest and is faking stuff&quot; to &quot;the earth is flat&quot;. Assuming the earth is flat because NASA is faking stuff is unfair because there could be loads of other reasons they&#39;re faking it. </p>

<p>I know a large part of conspiracy theories is going out and proving it yourself through the information out there rather than taking someone else&#39;s word for it, but when there&#39;s a sea of false information/people arguing as there is with the flat earth theory it would be much more beneficial to show the definitive evidence you&#39;ve seen that proves it. </p>

<p>Hope I didn&#39;t come off as though I&#39;m patronizing you, I&#39;m genuinely interested in this theory and so often I find that I can&#39;t have an actual discussion on it with someone who believes it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>*If day and night are caused by the globe&#39;s constant, and even, rotation, towards and away from the sun, then why isn&#39;t half the ball light and half the ball dark for equal lengths? And why isn&#39;t the transition fairly instantaneous?</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The sun is smaller and closer than we&#39;ve been told, as demonstrated by crepuscular rays (the atmosphere&#39;s round shape would actually concentrate light from millions of miles away into a pinpoint, not make it burst into multiple directions), sunspots on the tops of clouds, and it growing smaller, pixel by pixel, in sunsets. </p></li>
<li><p>We&#39;re taught that Mercury and Venus are in between us and the sun, but if we&#39;re facing away from the sun at night, how is it possible to see these &quot;planets&quot; at night with a telescope?</p></li>
<li><p>If we&#39;re really spinning and orbiting the sun, which is also orbiting something else, and Spaceship Earth has been flying in a random direction this whole time, why don&#39;t constellations change? Ursa Major has been referenced as early as Homer&#39;s Odyssey and if you live near the center of our circular plane you&#39;ll be able to see it in the exact same way tonight. And how would it be possible to have such a thing as a &quot;North star&quot;? </p></li>
</ul>

<p>*How is it possible for the Nikon P900 to zoom in on things so far away, particularly at sea level?</p>

<p>*High-altitude footage with a standard lens not only shows a flat horizon, but the horizon always raises to eye level no matter how high you go. There&#39;s no consistency at all with &quot;official&quot; footage. Google Image search &quot;Earth from space&quot; and there&#39;s no consistency between fake CG images, with duplicated clouds and uneven saturation. They&#39;re self-admitted composites, and the only real-real simple photographs we have are from the moon landings which we know were fake; that&#39;s why they were faked. </p>

<p><em>Books debunking heliocentrism were published as late as 1910 and all ancient cultures, which had a pretty good grasp on stars (think pyramids) knew the Earth was a flat motionless *circular</em> plane. </p>

<ul>
<li>&quot;Flat Earth&quot; has been given a negative connotation, by design, so I think it&#39;s better called &quot;Outer Space is a hoax&quot;. Space is constantly faked from the moon landings, to satellites (which went from science fiction to science fact in 2 years, thought-up by a Freemason. There are no shadows of satellites passing over the moon). On several occasions NASA astronauts and Obama said humans can&#39;t go past L.E.O. but we went to the moon 40 years ago? And theres video evidence of NASA using a model of a shuttle that was passed off as real, outer space footage, from the 1980s. </li>
</ul>

<p>*Moutains don&#39;t curve away over long distances, nor do buildings or railroad tracks. </p>

<p>*How does the vacuum of space attach to the non-vacuum of our atmosphere? How do shuttles achieve thrust in a vacuum? </p>

<p>*Airplanes flying out to the horizon don&#39;t follow around the supposed gradual curve but instead diminish in size until they&#39;re out of view. </p>

<p>*The sun and moon appear the same size, think eclipses, because they are the same size, it&#39;s no cosmic coincidence. We&#39;re done giving the benefit of the doubt to proven liars. We&#39;re told moonlight is reflected sunlight, but if the moon were a sphere as we&#39;re also told, then it wouldn&#39;t be so completely full in its reflection back, it wouldn&#39;t have the same reflection on the ocean as the sun, and its properties would be the same as the sun, not different; moonlight lowers temperatures making objects in the shade at night warmer, testable at home with an IR thermometer</p>

<ul>
<li>Seasons are caused on thr flat earth model by the sun rotating closer in Summer  (along the tropic of Cancer) and further away during Winter (along the tropic of Capricorn). What&#39;s the globe explanation? Does it really make any sense? If we&#39;re on opposing sides of the sun every 6 months why dont stars change? </li>
</ul>

<p>There&#39;s tons more but the point is, intelligent design is logical and you dont live on a rotating sphere</p>

<p>Say the wrong thing and theyll lump you in with flat earthers and anti vaxxers.    </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Oddly enough, I had a thoughtful discussion with a friend who brought up those &quot;looney anti-vaxxers&quot;.  I pointed out that many are simply concerned with the safety of vaccines.  We talked about the business of vaccines and how they had been so deregulated that Big Pharma no longer has liability, and thus not much incentive to manufacture safe vaccines.  It really made him think about his suppositions because many &quot;anti-vaxxer&quot; arguments are incredibly reasonable and are well-worth review.<br/>
That led us to talking about how certain labels like &quot;anti-vaxxer&quot; and &quot;conspiracy theorist&quot; have been successfully applied in an Orwellian way to make people, (like himself), automatically close their minds off from considering or questioning.<br/>
So, what you say about &quot;<em>build that base of distrust with smaller and easier to swallow theories</em>&quot; -- I just think its funny that I had success on a topic that you would consider a little crazy.<br/>
But, it&#39;s all good, we each get where we&#39;re going in our own ways.  I just try to stay open-minded.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes.  When I first started waking up I was PISSED!  And I wanted to share the info -- a real bull in the china shop.   So now I do consider their political bias and just general outlook on life before talking about any conspiracy topic.  Plus, I don’t bring it up.  If it comes up, I think about who I’m talking to first.<br/>
As far as political bias goes, I’m trying more and more to point out to people of both sides of the spectrum that we’ve got a lot more in common than most realize - like the economy, lack of jobs, difficulty of affording health insurance, endless wars.   People seem to be incredibly open to the concept that stuff like transgender bathrooms are just distractions meant to divide us.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Its completely true &amp; if anyone disagrees I am sorry, they are an idiot.</p>

<p>Look at any industry and I mean <em>any</em>.  What do you see?  It is no longer about making a good product.  It is about making <em>everything</em> a consumable.  Have you ever watched shark tank?  How many times have you seen people come in with an incredible revolutionary product only to be turned away because they cannot sell the product to the same person 10 times over?</p>

<p>Its called planned obsolescence.  Why in the hell would the medical industry be interested in making a <strong>cure</strong> for a disease when they rake in billions from charity?  Why would they be interesting in making a cure when they rake in billions from selling <em>&quot;treatments&quot;</em>.  Why would they be interested in creating a cure for cancer when the powers that be are looking for every avenue they can to reduce the world population?</p>

<p>No cure is coming.  If one ever does sit on it.  The likelihood that the powers that be would provide a cure to cancer is less likely than they would use it to create a &quot;I am legend&quot; type scenario.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So instead of any form of evidence you use broad anecdotal examples. Does the medical industry exploit the for profit nature of legal pharmaceuticals? Absolutely. Does that mean &quot;they&quot; have a cure for cancer? Who knows? One thing I do known is that medical research is not strictly private, you can&#39;t possibly expect the entirety of the medical research community to keep something so drastic and impactful a secret. </p>

<p>Just to understand your line of thinking, what do you imagine a cure for cancer would be? </p>

<p>If it were so easy to just make a mAb against cancer (one of my direct areas of study) then why would companies spend billions developing them, only to see them to fail in clinical trials? They do have a much higher success rate than small molecule drugs though, especially those outside of oncology. I think 6 mAbs have already been approved this year! </p>

And they&#39;re starting to look at who spun this enforced narrative to begin with. </p>

<p>It&#39;s encouraging to see this stuff reaching friends/family who have never cared before. It also signals an impending breakdown in societal values, which has significant risk attached to it. But given the current state of society, it&#39;s probably for the better. </p>

<p>This, along with the horizon &quot;rises to eye level&quot;, are some of the worst proofs of a flat earth. And yes, what is level to the gravity vector. Your videos don&#39;t prove anything aside that gravity won&#39;t happen on a small mass.</p>

<p>*If day and night are caused by the globe&#39;s constant, and even, rotation, towards and away from the sun, then why isn&#39;t half the ball light and half the ball dark for equal lengths? And why isn&#39;t the transition fairly instantaneous?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Earth&#39;s axial tilt.</p>

<p>The earth doesn’t spin perfectly aligned to the sun. Because of this tilt, the part tilted toward the sun will be illuminated longer than the part tilted away. Shine a ling on a ball, as it rotates perfectly vertically. If you raise the light above the ball, the top part will receive longer “days” since it stays in the light longer, and the opposite will happen on the opposite side. If you lower the light, the reverse happens.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The sun is smaller and closer than we&#39;ve been told, as demonstrated by crepuscular rays (the atmosphere&#39;s round shape would actually concentrate light from millions of miles away into a pinpoint, not make it burst into multiple directions), sunspots on the tops of clouds, and it growing smaller, pixel by pixel, in sunsets.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Gonna need a source for that claim about multiple directions.</p>

<p>Parallel lines that are slanted towards you <a href="https://ibin.co/2NKPsMZFgJvu">will appear to converge due to perspective.</a> The same way railroad tracks do. I also don&#39;t know how you can determine the distance of the Sun just using this observation. Tell me, <a href="https://i.redd.it/9vndmaibu7rx.jpg">is the Sun behind this tree?</a></p>

<p>No, the Sun doesn&#39;t shrink in size. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhNFoy2fAr4">Use a solar filter, and take a time lapse of it.</a> If the sun were close we should see not only a change in size, but in apparent speed as well.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.geogebra.org/m/C9BcVgd4">Here is a model to help you out.</a>)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We&#39;re taught that Mercury and Venus are in between us and the sun, but if we&#39;re facing away from the sun at night, how is it possible to see these &quot;planets&quot; at night with a telescope?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, because they’re not visible <strong>all</strong> night. It has to be fairly close to sunrise or sun set before either of these objects can be seen at night. There is a reason a planet like Venus is called the evening/morning star.</p>

<p>Look into geometry.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If we&#39;re really spinning and orbiting the sun, which is also orbiting something else, and Spaceship Earth has been flying in a random direction this whole time, why don&#39;t constellations change? Ursa Major has been referenced as early as Homer&#39;s Odyssey and if you live near the center of our circular plane you&#39;ll be able to see it in the exact same way tonight. And how would it be possible to have such a thing as a &quot;North star&quot;?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Distance. Look into geometry.</p>

<p>Why do you think that &quot;north star&quot; is impossible?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>*How is it possible for the Nikon P900 to zoom in on things so far away, particularly at sea level?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Simple. Zoom magnifies what is already there. Remember the first comment that I made, as well as me asking to backup your claims regarding zoom? Do it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>*High-altitude footage with a standard lens not only shows a flat horizon, but the horizon always raises to eye level no matter how high you go. There&#39;s no consistency at all with &quot;official&quot; footage. Google Image search &quot;Earth from space&quot; and there&#39;s no consistency between fake CG images, with duplicated clouds and uneven saturation. They&#39;re self-admitted composites, and the only real-real simple photographs we have are from the moon landings which we know were fake; that&#39;s why they were faked.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=youtu.be&amp;amp;v=Pv4Hwk17F8Y">Uh, yes we can.</a> Slight, yet noticeable.</p>

<p><a href="http://imgur.com/2tknKav">Image 1</a></p>

<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/S0kAptC.jpg">Image 2</a></p>

<p>What I love about these claims that &quot;looks flat&quot;, is that some of these weather balloons actually <strong>do</strong> carry fish eye lens. An example being the &quot;little piggy&quot; one which shows distortion if you see the entire footage of the flight, like <a href="http://i.imgur.com/rRCGi8q.png">here.</a></p>

<p>The horizon doesn&#39;t rise to &quot;eye level&quot;. You can actually measure the drop of the horizon using a theodolite. An example being <a href="http://m.imgur.com/iB89TnJ">here.</a> Another one being from a plane like <a href="http://m.imgur.com/cBrTtzR">here.</a></p>

<p>If you, for some reason, don&#39;t trust theodolites then there are other proofs. Such as both the Moon and the horizon <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ha6PeAVLpNo">being below the eye level of an obersver in a plane.</a> Here&#39;s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFj7gNh3yOM">another one.</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>*Moutains don&#39;t curve away over long distances, nor do buildings or railroad tracks.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How much distance is needed for them to turn a single degree? Look it up.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>*How does the vacuum of space attach to the non-vacuum of our atmosphere? How do shuttles achieve thrust in a vacuum?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Gravity. Equal and opposite reactions.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>*The sun and moon appear the same size, think eclipses, because they are the same size, it&#39;s no cosmic coincidence.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Both the Sun and Moon will vary in size over the year. Look into the different types of eclipses, as well as the Moon&#39;s libration over a month.</p>

<p>I won&#39;t entertain the rest, as it seems that you haven&#39;t researched anything to do with the globe.</p>
