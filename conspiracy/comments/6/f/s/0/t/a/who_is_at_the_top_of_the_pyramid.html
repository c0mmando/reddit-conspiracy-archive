       I see most of our political problems starting with Jacob Frank, Rothschild, and Weishupt conspiring in the 1700s. Weishupt was a Jesuit, but not sure how that translates into rome ruling. They all seem to be serving Frankist goals.

       No, they are not. You are being fooled, as many others are. Listen, I go against the grain here and seek the truth... Done my research, what the actual fuck have you done? You think Rotschilds are top shit, no... They are dog shit in the grand scheme of things... You need to research more.

       Why does this go back to Sumeria when the messianic cult was started in 1600s or so? Doesn't Sumeria predate the Talmud, which enabled the messianic plan?

       Sumeria-&gt;Babylon-&gt;Egypt-&gt;Rome. There are theories that Judaism (and all Abrahamic religions) was created by the dark priest class of Sumeria via that lineage. The Talmud is just a rewriting of far more ancient "religions/beliefs". It's occult/esoteric. If people truly want to understand things, they have to go to the roots, not the branches, imo.

       Prior to WW2, the Vatican had more power than the Jews. But, after WW2, the Jews are the most powerful group on Earth. Look at how the Congress of the U.S. gave Bibi 29 standing ovations. 29!! That is the most dick sucking, butt licking, ass kissing that I have ever seen. No Pope would receive the kind of worship that was bestowed upon Bibi. You need to do more research.

       Tri-Sovereign States, and Khazars (fake Jew Mercs). You need to research more. Why does Israel (Khazar Zionists) get a free pass? It's not because "Jews", it's because the Holy Roman Empire wants this (They protect the Holy Lands for them). You need to do more research...

       Nope. My very Jewish mother taught me you judge people on how they treat you. I have never seen more dick sucking; bung-hole licking by the United Sates Congress than what was bestowed upon Bibi. No human on Earth receives such adulation and worship. Let's get the Pope in front of Congress, and let's see what happens.

       So, you are of the opinion that Jews are of a certain "mold". That we all think alike? Right? That we don't have differing views? What the fuck is wrong with you Jew haters? What you need to do is go meet some Jews. Go talk to them. That will help you out of your dilemma.

       The true leaders will not behave as such out in the open. The Queen doesn't, and neither does the Pope. Yet, the Queen owns a sixth of the land of this planet. Yet, the leaders of the Commonwealth such as Trudeau bow before her and pledge their eternal allegiance to her. The Rothschilds have no such privilege and have only gotten as far as they have due to the blessings of the aristocracy they themselves have married into.

       The Monarchies of Europe are "figure-heads". You can thank Rothschild for that.

      <p>
       In 1850, the Rothschild's wealth was $6 billion. That translates into $200 trillion in today's money. What the inbred Rothschilds did was put all of their wealth into trusts; starting in the 1870's. Today, a Rothschild is just a name. The trusts are what rule the world.

       Okay, so you're literally denying facts. I used to think that royalty were simply figureheads too, as that is what people told me. Look up the powers the Queen holds. She is not a figurehead, never has been.

       Rothchild Married into the Aldobrandini family that should give you a glimpse at the power structure that is at work, i think you are both right, the Sabbetean-Frankist group is at odds with this old power structure though there is an inner elite war going on right now, you think these court jews liked playing second fiddle to these Papal bloodlines? I think our main problem is seeing them as one monolithic power structure but there is a constant struggle for the top going on through out history. Try not to fall for one of these sides being the good guys either cause they are fighting the other bad guys.

       The Rothschilds are most likely below the Crown and the Vatican. They also have inferiority complexes due to them not being considered "true" aristocracy; they are afterall from a merchant family in the 16th century. By contrast, royal bloodlines go back thousands of years.

       Yeah this. It is Satan. It is hard to believe, but there are some who have given their lives to him. The luciferians worship the false light of lucifer. They are inherently gnostic in central beliefs and delight in the juxtaposition of things. They believe in struggle and the creation of polar opposites in order to create a new paradigm from the two. The thing is if people could actually see Satan in his former glory, they would think his was a god and fall on their faces. This being is incredibly powerful and beyond our reach. He is in the hands of God almighty. HE will deal with him.

       It's possible that there's a "top" to the pyramid, but I'd suggest that might be an overly-simplistic way of looking at things. Looking at the idea of a global hierarchy that looks like a pyramid with a ball on top representing the person or group in control, the top is an unstable equilibrium. Any slight change of position will push it off. (Compare this with a stable equilibrium like a ball in the bottom of a bowl.)
      </p>
      <p>
       It seems to me that a better analogy would be the childhood game King of the Hill. The goal is to stay on top, but once your there, even if you're the strongest individual, the others will team up and push you off.
      </p>
      <p>
       If we look at the last (arguably) global empire, in that it at it's height it had no viable external adversaries, Rome, you saw the same pattern. The Emperor was an autocrat, but his position was precarious. Nearly half were assassinated or possibly assassinated. The Sword of Damocles hung heavy over their heads.
      </p>
      <p>
       If there is one "top" of the pyramid in some sort of stable equilibrium, I'd argue it'd almost have to be done in some sort of gentlemen's agreement to compete with each other without actually going to war. Not that they couldn't send the respective countries or corporations to war with each other, but assassinations and the like would be off limits.

       Sure, there's apex predators, alpha-males (in the wolf sense), but even these change over time. Alpha males are killed by younger rivals, apex predators become extinct by changing environments, or other species becoming better adapted. The only constant in nature is change. I'm not saying there isn't someone at the top, only that I don't necessarily think it's static.

       This contradicts your natural argument, though, doesn't it? If you want to make an argument that some extra-terrestrial or otherwise non-human entity or group created humanity for it's own purposes, that's fine. I haven't seen any evidence for it though.

       Accidental? I don't know if I'd say that. More multiple factions competing for supremacy. Maybe one group has held supremacy for some time, now, but I imagine there's at least still competition for supremacy within that group.

       My theory is that the world is a people farm. There's a wealthy, nomadic, international class at the very top. Doesn't matter what name you call them. Basically, they are to the rest of us what a herd of livestock is to a farmer.
      </p>
      <p>
       They care for us about as much as the average farmer cares about his cattle. We're here to be productive so that they can live comfortably off of our efforts.

       The few hundred richest families/bloodlines in the world is what I can say for sure.  Who sits atop that throne?  Impossible to say.  My guess would be maybe a few of these families essentially share power/control and make the final decisions, perhaps the three most powerful families or the eight most powerful families since these people seem to really love 3's and 8's.

      <p>
       In 1850, the Rothschild's wealth was $6 billion. That translates into $200 trillion in today's money. What the inbred Rothschilds did was put all of their wealth into trusts; starting in the 1870's. Today, a Rothschild is just a name. The trusts are what rule the world.
