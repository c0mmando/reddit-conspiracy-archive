       If I were earning that much I wouldn't have any problem paying a slightly higher rate of tax, but then I'm not a greedy cunt. As it stands there are nurses using food banks and May wants to
       <em>
        cut taxes for the wealthy
       </em>
       while
       <a href="http://www.itv.com/news/2017-06-03/theresa-may-questioned-on-tax-plans/">

       , including those who already can't make ends meet.

       I'm guessing you haven't suffered the ravages of austerity yourself, they are literally killing poor families already so the wealthy can maintain this state of affairs.

       lol man. "that much". do you realize how high the tax rate is already? have you tried working harder / longer / putting more thought into your career path etc? maybe you'd be earning more too.

       I don't earn more because I don't have a dependant family, I live comfortably within my means, have no debts at all and claim absolutely no benefits either.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't need more because I'm not trapped in the consumerist hell that people have been conned into thinking is the path to happiness and success. Real happiness lies in rejecting these traps and living in a smarter way, despite all the slaves telling you you're wrong for rejecting their stockholm syndrome situations.

       well some people dont have debts either but want to have a family. one way that we can fight the system is by not allowing them to replace us. that means big family. supporting big family means earning more.

       Man, they're already replacing us with machinery and that's accelerating daily, more children just means even more unemployed people with the way things appear to be going. The future isn't looking too good for people who can't repair things for the other dispossessed ex-workers. That's what I do for a living, I buy cheap things from car-boot sales and auctions and repair and restore them, because I see that as a future-proof career and a way of making a passable living that actually starves the machine. A machine that only sees us as a tool to perpetuate its own future.

       As I said, I have no need for growth whatsoever as I'm housed and not hungry, just me, a shed and my tools, and I hardly ever have to do much work either as I occasionally repair something quite valuable to other people. I enjoy what I do and it rewards me adequately. My missus has a proper career in the charity sector and only works a half-week as more wouldn't be fun and she earns enough too, we live in a different world to most people I guess.

       funny you use that quote since it is often used to explain why the proletariat mong mind set never took place amongst americans (im not american btw)

      <p>
       in any case...not really. its called career planning. called learning skills &amp; putting in effort. achieving success isn't some magical thing. sure we might not all become (((elite))) but nothing stopping you achieving relative success (and more depending on how risk inclined / entrepreneurial you are)

       i would have more compassion if the government wasnt trying to feed the whole 3rd world as well as our own wastemen. if we focused only on our own wastemen citizen then maybe id have more compassion.

       wealthy bubble please. my family raised themselves from poverty through hard work and effort. not some multi generational hand overs and accumulation of wealth. try it some time.

       Ignorant point of view.
      </p>
      <p>
       You think everyone can earn that much? You think if we ALL try hard then we'll all be on 80k+
      </p>
      <p>
       What about the nurses using food banks? What about carers and cleaners and those in retail and countless other jobs where the opportunity to earn 80k doesn't exist.
      </p>
      <p>
       I earn just above average UK wage. I'm not looking for handouts for me. I want the weakest in society protected and if that means taxing those who are natural sociopaths with a propensity for greed then so be it.

       well im sorry but those cleaners dont produce the economic value to be worth £80k. you dont simply get high salary for the sake of "humanity". not every one DESERVES £80k +
      </p>
      <p>
       nurses and other medical professionals can earn more than enough through contracting.
      </p>
      <p>
       i've reviewed the finances of hospitals. trust me, medical staff aren't suffering. those sweet sweet consulting gigs really rake in the £££ for them.
      </p>
      <p>
       if only people like you had more ambition then you'd realize that those of us on 80-100k etc aren't sociopaths who are greedy. were simply smarter, hungrier and more hard working. The greedy sociopaths are the people worth 100-200m+ running sweat shops paying people minimum salary &amp; outsourcing to 3rd world labour etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       these people sit on dividend income or simply live by expensing life through their corporations. these people sure as hell wont be hit by the £80k+ income tax hit. they have their money come to them in different manner.
      </p>
      <p>
       you lower class people are literally just trying to destroy the middle class. you are not "fighting the powers/elite" in this manner.

      <p>
       Let me explain so you don't think I'm being anti-ambition:
The system is rigged beyond your imagination
if you think it's the poor stealing from the rich.
I guarantee you it's waaay more the other way round.
      </p>
      <p>
       Corporations/bankers/establishment leech from the poor.
Socialism for the rich (crony capitalism) 
gives corporations subsidies (free tax money)
despite being insanely successful already.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not about ambition.
I'm very much in favor of helping small and medium businesses but big corporations take advantage of us.
      </p>
      <p>
       The working/middle classes generate almost all wealth in the country
and corporations exploit that wealth,
pay low wages, dodge taxes, receive subsidies,
rig democracy by bribing congress and ghost-writing our laws,
moving jobs abroad so their corporate jobs go to the most
poor/desparate workers willing to work hard shitty jobs for as low as possible, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       The establishment are the scum of the earth 
and it consists of wall street, elite bankers, corporations,
and possibly some royalty and the Vatican if you go down that rabbit hole.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm definitely an ambitious person and want
what's best for small/medium businesses who play by the rules
rather than unethical corporations.
      </p>
      <p>
       The top 5% aren't going to be small/medium businesses.
To give perspective on how rigged the economy is,
there are I think $13 trillion of money abroad in tax havens
that the elite just sit their asses on.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think it's great to be ambitious whether it's in the private (e.g. business) or public sector 
but at the same time I want our taxes to go towards services
that benefit US, the people.
Right now it's a pathway for cash flow to the elites
at our expense.
I want the working/middle classes to get their tax's money's worth
(not get ripped off) and have an ethical safety net.
      </p>
      <p>
       Taxation isn't theft, it's the way it's implemented
that determines if there's theft.
      </p>
      <p>
       E.g. if taxes went purely to help the people,
e.g. health care, transport (you may need s train to get to work),
higher education (many jobs require it),
energy, science/tech, etc.
then there would be less poverty and the tax payer and worker
is compensated fairly for contributing to the economy
rather than allowing corporations to sit on money
and reduce circulation when they dodge tax and pay low wages.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also don't want the military industrial complex to profit
off war from our taxes. I don't want to contribute to warmongers.
But I sure as hell would be willing to pay for healthcare
if it's nationalized (not having big pharma and insurance companies having
too large a piece of the profit pie at our expense).
      </p>
      <p>
       If I was rich, I absolutely would have the same mindset.
I'm willing to help those who need it,
but fuck those corporations who facilitate economic slavery.
In fact, my business would thrive under a more fair
taxation system as there would be less poverty and thus
more customers that can afford my products.
Conservativism (branches: globalist NEOliberalism, NEOconservativism, unregulated free market capitalism, etc.)
is just there for the establishment to conserve a low waged population (economic slavery)
through rigged legislature.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nothing wrong with being ambitious but
I don't want the tax payer/workers to be ripped off.
Not saying wealth should be distributed completely evenly
(some deserve more pay than others)
but certainly we need more opportunities
(cheaper travel, free/cheap higher education to get qualifications,
cheaper energy, cheaper uncorrupted healthcare, etc.)
in order to pull people out of poverty indefinitely.
      </p>
      <p>
       We don't have to have a dog-eat-dog world.
It's just been socially engineered this way by the establishment.

       Not sure these attacks work in May's favor. Her numbers have been in free fall since the last attack (though there are numerous reasons for that). If you're the person in charge of the country and the attacks keep getting worse, how does that inspire people to want to keep you and yours around?
