    <div class="md"><p>Really, what you want is to put up blatant Republican lies with no accountability. What you want is to cry that anyone who is tired of HRC constantly must be a supporter. What you want is to distract from Donald Trump&#39;s wrongdoing -- whether it be the blatant lies, the conversation to a pure corporate oligarch Koch agenda, his escalation of wars, his obstruction of justice, and on and on it goes.</p>

<p>And most importantly, you want to keep up the fraud that Donald Trump is some kind of outsider -- so you and your Republican cohorts can pretend later that you&#39;re surprised by Donald Trump and use that trick to hold power longer.</p>

<p>Republicans have held the bulk of power for more than a generation and the nation is looking pretty crappy. HRC neither did that (although she certainly played a role) nor is HRC in power now.</p>

<p>That&#39;s why the new screen name.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s how its been. Since sometime before the election, the priority by the wave of new accounts in this sub insisted that Hillary Clinton was the worst person to ever live -- and that she must be opposed no matter who or what ran against her.</p>

<p>Now, we have a situation where one party -- the Republican Party -- has monopolized the power structure more than ever before. And the last time the Republican Party had such unbalanced power, their oppressive agenda set up World War 2, and their economic agenda set up the Great Depression. These are facts.</p>

<p>Today&#39;s Republican Party has literally an identical economic agenda as thney did in the 1920&#39;s. They have not learned a single thing.</p>

<p>Also, Donald Trump, the fraud outsider who was against war has been escalating wars and breaking promises about NATO and the NWO right and left.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s be consistent ...</p>

<p>What was good enough for HRC is good enough for Donald Trump and the Republicans -- THEY MUST BE OPPOSED NO MATTER WHAT.</p>

<p>(Or take your blatant partisan posts out of conspiracy and let us get back to talking about deeper and more interesting things) </p>

<p>If you can read that without buying into child trafficking 4chan nonsense that will give you some idea of her positives. Working towards the betterment of humanity in some of the neediest places on the globe.</p>

<p>Other political positives would be that she has a comprehensive outlook toward climate change, has solid foreign policy, she keeps the GOP in check, and has done many positive things for women and minorities.</p>

That pisses me off because Bernie would have supported gay rights. Plus, Bernie wanted to help people who are struggling. Hillary is a corporate Democrat. Bernie is not.</p>

<p>The gays and lesbians hate Trump with a passion. Why? I don&#39;t think he cares what people do with their sex organs. I don&#39;t think he is &quot;anti-gay&quot;. But, if he is impeached and kicked out of office, I guarantee all of you who are gay that a President Pence will be your biggest nightmare. That man is a religious fanatic, and he is so zealous, he makes Michele Bachmann look like an atheist.</p>

<p>So maybe, if you&#39;re so &quot;neutral&quot;, you should look at all the evidence of the good things she&#39;s done and ask to hear from her detractors. Ask them to prove their bullshit.</p>
