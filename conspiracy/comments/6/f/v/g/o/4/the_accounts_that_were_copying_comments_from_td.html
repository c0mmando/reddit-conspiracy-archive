       You're free to downvote all you like, but whoever made them isn't relevant to why I made this post. Who deleted them, however, is. We didn't hear a word about these accounts after they were caught. Did they delete themselves? Was it admins? That is all I'm asking.

       I've deleted previous accounts because I don't want to lose my job for going against the "governments" narrative (not Trumps, but CNN/Hillary's/Obamas/etc)
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't want this to be linked to me in real life.  I eventually delete all my posts, just like this one because I understand our government's capabilities and the evil people behind it pushing this anti-Russian narrative.(and anti-Trump)

       Anyway, I've had multiple accounts banned/shadowbanned.  There is without a doubt establishment(not Trump) sensorship and propagandists though-out reddit, especially in this sub.

       I think they most value the overplayed hand of shareblue continuing to sweep sites and media with panicked narratives -as somewhere in the vicinity of ~0% ever materializes or proves to be remotely accurate.  Evidence is bots and shills push hate hate hate and nothing to do with representing Dems, countering ideas or policies, or offering alternatives.  It's easy to program bots to say mean things or vote manipulate posts and subs -with none other than admin approval.  It would take a LOT more work for a mod or user to manipulate votes, and I don't see that being worthwhile in this case. What'd be the payoff for such an extreme feat?  Or perhaps someone has an exploit for that and I could be wrong. But again, for a site of this magnitude, it most assuredly has safeguards to thwart or at least monitor and alert such activity.
      </p>
      <p>
       The mishandling of power, like those 2016 polls in the monopolized media, I believe will teach mankind a lesson in flexing excess power. And technology, we're learning, played a huge roll in this lesson (not that I think excess power should learn from lessons, but enlightens all nonetheless) History shows many examples of blunders in warfare by the side whom are overconfident or on the brink of loss and invoking scorched Earth strategies. Do you suspect someone is pushing an artificial war here and fumbling with their own declaration? Who? It seems yesteryear's tactics didn't work, and some tech-inept elitist pushed a miswired redemption button that had no prepared procedure.  Every day seems to give additional merit to this. I don't see it playing out much longer which is good news for the systematic followers, young people, and our future -in the long run. Ignorance is only bliss when it's not uncovered.

       Maybe I'm wrong.

       That is a weird response.  The poster has a good point, did the footwork, and found all those accounts cut.  Maybe someone like u/flytape is able to view the user info to see if admins cut them, or if they were self-deletes.

       Ahh okay I just looked at it.
      </p>
      <p>
       It looks like the admins used the old shadowban method so that the users don't get notified of the ban.  They do this to avoid having them just make a new a account and start over again with the same old fuckery.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think they only use the shadowban with spammers now.

       Let's be honest, that was someone beta testing their version of botting.  Next version, they will know to edit it up or change it around so it isn't so obvious.  I have to admit the name choices are interesting and diverse.  Someone will get it right next time.

       About the names, I've been trying to find correlation or maybe a DB they're pulling these from
      </p>
      <p>
       The only thing I've found is that a few of them are online gaming profiles, many of them on Kongregate or Twitch (some have personal info, not linking)
      </p>
      <p>
       CNCCocoa has a Twitch Profile
      </p>
      <p>
       DarePunisher is on Kongregate
      </p>
      <p>
       Daipenmon is a Digimon
      </p>
      <p>
       Veralann has a gaming channel somewhere, theres a twitter handle called Veralann Gaming
      </p>
      <p>
       SultanPeach has an instagram
      </p>
      <p>
       A lot of them only pull up results for Reddit though. Funnily enough, they often pull each other up in Google. Like if I search for Discogoatsex, I get links for the profiles for DarePunisher, Detective Mash, and Aryan-Swede.
      </p>

       Seems to me that the name choosing might not be automated

       Interesting!  Guessing the links for the profiles that are connected, are connected because of the Reddit posts finding the duplicate posts?  Or is there another connection?

       It would be ingenious grabbing gamer profile names, as they are diverse.

       It's certainly possible. Trawl through social media finding usernames, then search for those same usernames on other sites; if you find a gap, plug it with that name so you have more stuff coming up attaching it to a real person if someone tries to search outside that site.

       I don't even post in T_D, I think I did once on a non-political related issue and then deleted it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've been banned from /worldpolitics without reason, shadowbanned from /news and /politics.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've tried using VPN and creating new accounts to post in /politics, but not sure why all my posts are shadowbanned.  Maybe they don't allow new accounts to post?  Either way, I've been civil just throwing out "conspiracy" information such as:
      </p>
      <p>
       JFK Assassination and cover up. Lee Harvey Oswald didn't shoot JFK. The Warren report is BS, and everyone knows it. Some journalists, military, and others have been killed /suicided/"accidental" deaths that had connections and info that could destroy the already faulty narrative being pushed by the media to make people believe in the "official" government's Warren report. They killed our president, because like many others that advocate peace and against preemptive wars are killed. Preemptive war is like killing yourself because you're afraid of death. MSM continues to beat the war drums for their puppetmasters own interest. This sub is their stomping grounds and most of you regulars have been brainwashed and fed propaganda. This post will be censored, downvoted to hell, and it'll be just another banned throwaway fighting against the dividing warmongers in our country. I didn't vote for Trump. This sub and many others perpetuate identity politics. CNN is the worst, all MSM take marching orders from corporations that manipulate the public's opinion to support the military industrial complex. Think for yourselves, this place is run by shills and manipulators, it is easy to take on their half-truths.

       Not sub specific, because I'm able to post here.  I've never posted in /politics with this account until I just tried ~45 min ago.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'll appeal to a mod, see what they say... its probably for a bullshit reason, which single me out with their blatant partisan double standards.  (If I were to say "The definition of cuck or invading migrant")  which may be "racist" in some peoples minds, but I swear I'm not racist, I just have a difference of opinion and am worried about
       <a href="http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/05/26/muslims-and-islam-key-findings-in-the-u-s-and-around-the-world/">

       Again, I'm not racist or bigot.  I have legitimate critisicms against Islam and majority of muslims in the world.  "Islamophobia" is propaganda.  I have a difference of opinion from what "the establishment" is trying to manipulate the publics opinion into conforming to should not be sensored.

       Of course not. See my username? Think I'm for these "preemptive wars" that the MSM uses to justify support for?  They were fine when dictators kept them under control, but the US decided to take advantage of resources in the Middle East and take over resources, say we need to invade Iraq because WMDs etc, and the narrative is set by these oil tycoons and huge corporations that ultimately dictate our foreign policy for their own financial gain.  I'm against wars, I'm anti-imperialism, which is now "isolationism", but not in the sense of North Korea isolationists.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm simply stating, this culture, and these people hate western civilization.  The whole world is
       <strong>
        not
       </strong>
       on board with the modern western values of tolerance regardless of ethnicity, sex, gender, sexual orientation, or religion(which is reallly fucking lenient as we have Scientologists and LDS which are practically cults, at least their religion doesn't tell them to convert or kill nonbelievers.)
      </p>
      <p>
       There is such thing as incompatible cultures, that will clash and tensions will rise until violence happens.  Who wants violence?  I don't, but these muslims apparently do, because if you were more informed about their religion and what values it has, what purpose it has, and its goals, you'd see it perfectly lines up with the past 1400 years.  These fuckers are barbarians, and I'd take Scientologists or LDS Jahova witnesses over them any day.

       If you have legit criticisms about islam, I have legit criticisms about white males in America.
      </p>
      <p>
       FACT: All of the terrorism against American in the US in 2017 has been done by white males.
      </p>
      <p>
       When are we going to start monitoring this obvious threat?
      </p>
      <p>
       FACT: A higher % of white male terrorists to white males exists over muslim terrorists to muslims.
      </p>
      <p>
       You want to be afraid of terrorists? Then check your own people. You are more likely to be killed by a white male terrorist than a muslim one in America.
      </p>
      <p>
       All of your fears are rooted in fake bullshit.

       So you are saying these terrorist attacks by muslims are to be accepted, just a normal part of daily life living in a city as the Muslim mayor of London says?   Its not fears...  Muslims a history of conquest, why do you think they'd stop?  You don't know shit about islam and how their barbaric religion and culture has no place in the tolerant west.

      <p>
       This is how I KNOW people like you are not sincere about actual death and problems in the US. People like you do NOT CARE! People like you just want to attack anything and everything they think is different.
      </p>
      <p>
       ALL the terrorist attacks in America in 2017 were done by white men - you have NOTHING to say.
      </p>
      <p>
       This isnt even "but what about this" they are literally the ONLY terrorist attacks in America.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since 911 white males have attacked America more than anyone.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why do you have a problem with defending America from terrorists that are white?
      </p>
      <p>
       because you don't REALLY care about defending America!
      </p>
      <p>
       People like you are obvious racists and bigots who just want America to be white.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am here to tell you that you are fighting a losing war. No matter what you do you will lose. All the white males attacking America will lose, and all of you supporting them will love.
      </p>
      <p>
       Brown people are taking the land back no matter what.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whites are already a big minority in America. White males make up less than 30% of America and declining fast.
      </p>
      <p>
       So keep up all these wars against brown people. Because brown people will remember.

       What the everliving fuck?  And you're calling me racist? 
From what you are saying, you are anti-white, no wonder you agree with this insane anti-western narrative.  Western civilization and all the values, tolerance, the enlightenment period which gave rise to much of the advanced world we live in now was developed by white Christian Europeans.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm against wars.. I'm against racism and bigotry for those who assimilate to western values. I am for however defending my country and western civilization which is tolerant to multiculturalism, but not so tolerant to regress by accepting barbaric regressive cultures, that apparently you support.  Insane...

       Native Americans were slaughtered to create America. Good ole white christian values.
      </p>
      <p>
       Africans were enslaved and brought to this land to make it what it is. Free labor made America. Good ole white christian values.
      </p>
      <p>
       Chinese built the railroads for next to nothing which made commere huge in America. But hey, those good ole white christian values again.
      </p>
      <p>
       So white christians killed, tortured, stole and enslaved their way to power and you expect people to just forget that shit NOW? Oh, NOW its okay?

       Fuck that. This country is going brown again and nothing you can do about it.

       How DARE you think white christians who stole and killed their way here are good people.
      </p>
      <p>
       You ONLY think this way because they are white. Typical selective memory bullshit that racists and bigots use. THAT is insanity.

       I'll insulte Islam if you want.  The pedophile that liked sucking on little boy's tongues.  What a great rolemodel, to have 6yr old bride and had the decency to wait 3 years before fucking her.  Were you fucked as a little boy by your muslim brothers? Apparently that is acceptable over there in Barbaristan, along with fucking goats.  I'm glad extreme fucks like you are getting drone-striked every day.  I'm not mad, u mad?  Yeah, you seem about on the edge of going out and murdering the most weak innocent people you can find, because they don't have the balls to fight anyone that can fight back.   I have a Quran just to rip out pages to wipe my ass with... some of these have fine paper!  I hope there is a cartoon drawing contest to make fun of Muhammed near you, to draw your triggered delusional ass out to retaliate, so your life would sooner be over.

       at least I don't idolize a pedophile and so deluded to think he is the perfect rolemodel.  Yup, its racist to criticize islam and a lunatic that got others to believe in his barbaric religion and backwards culture.  You seem to be projecting quite a bit, thinking other people are racists and angry because they are poor.  U mad? cuz im not.  You've got it all backwards... which is no surprise.

       Look though his history.  He is an Islamist, and its apparent.  He deleted some of his posts which made it a little too clear, after I pressed him on it.  I hope he is on a watch list and honestly investigated, because it seems this guy is seriously troubled and hateful of the west and white people.

       This is why many leftists that dont have a good understanding of Islam or history side with Muslims(far right).  They've lived peaceful cozy lives and have been fed this belief that the most oppressed are the most virtuous and need defending.  Anyone that criticizes Islam are considered Islamophobes or bigots because these people don't have the ability or willfully ignorant to not understand the uncomfortable truth that there are people in the world that literally want to destroy the west, and replace it with Sharia.  It's happening now, and people still say that this is "religious freedom".  There are limits.  The left's compassion, tolerance and acceptance is not reciprocated by the "moderate" far right muslims.   Just with this guy,  he gets upvotes from the overly liberal/far-leftists that support this actual hateful racist and bigot.  This is why the right has rightfully contributed the term "cuck" to the left.  I'll likely be downvoted as the norm, be called a T_D supporter, "far right" and I'm the racist/bigot.  Just like Tommy Robinson, he is considered "far right" like politicians Le Pen or Wilders.  Its bullshit. The media has brainwashed and feeds propaganda to the masses, and it works.

       subs can shadowban specific posts. its weird how it works. You will see your post and anyone viewing your profile can see your post there, but they cannot respond to it and they cannot see it in the actual thread.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is how mods shut down discussion. You respond to someone and think they never responded - check their profile to see if they did.

       and have not been banned by any of the subreddits you suggest auto-ban people for commenting there. This has not happened on any of my accounts. You're full of shit.

       If you are being honest then the most likely explanations are automod removing comments from new or low karma accounts or the admins trying to prevent you from repeatedly evading bans. Which is against site-wide rules.

       I wasn't making the claim that if you post in T_D you get banned.  I give my experience.  BTW... this is the response I got:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Hey MSM15 - this was an interesting case. Let me just say that no moderator manually removed your comment - it appears that a phrase in your comment triggered a phrase filter we use specifically on megathreads to cut down on noise in what are usually very large / crowded threads. I have approved one of the post attempts, specifically this:
        <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/6fv8bi/megathread_release_of_james_comeys_opening/dilji91/">
         https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/6fv8bi/megathread_release_of_james_comeys_opening/dilji91/
        </a>
        As to the downvote that is weird, the only thing we came up with is that perhaps the comments were downvoted before the filter kicked it - automod can lag on large thread or during peak load - or maybe someone downvoted from your user page. Quite obviously, you have concerns about our sub and I totally respect whatever opinions you hold - but I hope my explanation of what occurred in this makes sense. Let us know if you have any other questions.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Then I asked about these "filters" and what triggers them.  I gave examples like saying MSM or propaganda.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        None of those... we don't discuss the filter in most circumstances but in this instance I'll offer that we have special rules for megathreads that bar 'meta' comments that don't contribute to the discussion. So I believe it was the 'this sub' phrase that got the comment pulled.
I don't see any other comments you've made in r/politics removed - this one for example is showing just fine to me. If you have examples of things not showing correctly, I'd gladly take a look.

       You're bitching about this when
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       has a stated rule about not bitching about the mods or subreddit? Somehow it's okay for
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy

       to censor that but not
       <a href="/r/politics">

       ?
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, it's common for subreddits to not discolse what triggers the automod, because the only result of that is people figuring out all the creative ways to subvert the automod. It's common sense.

       I'm not a Russian bot.  I'm a goddamn patriot and the fact all these "russian bots" keep pointing to Hillary and the DNC's corruption are likely also Americans that haven't drank the coolaid to "just get over it" because she lost.  T_D and Trump supporters aren't the only ones that think Hillary, members of the DNC/Podesta need to be locked up, and that there is a lot of red flags surrounding Seth Rich which should be investigated, not just wrote off as a "robbery" and just one of the 60 murders in DC that haven't been solved(which by in itself is unacceptable).  Political elites are attempting to brainwash the public, and if anything, we should be thanking Russians for exposing our curruption, so Americans can take action and make our democracy stronger, not weaker.  But of course "deep state" doesn't want that, and they'll keep pushing this anti-Russian narrative to delegitimize Trump, ramp up the Trump hate so the public wouldn't second guess some  "lone gunman nut" kills Trump, and cover it up just like they did with JFK.
      </p>
      <p>
       T_D is far more American - inline with American values in the constitution than the imperialistic warmongers that virtuesignal to idiots and manipulate americans minds with their MSM mass propaganda.

       Yeah, dismiss the past two decades of all presidents trampling on our constitution.  Preemptive wars are unconstitutional and un-american because they go against the core values of what America stands for.  You're the sheep, go plug back into MSM which is controlled by 6 corporations that support the military industrial complex.

       I say tourture those Islamists that have killed innocent people.  Go for it.. I understand we live in the real world, and these barbarians killing invading and killing innocent people need to think twice.  Maybe a little tourture would deter them instead of taking the easy way out, killing themselves in the process, delusionally thinking they are a martyr and will get 72 virgins.

       Surprise, same can be said for all other echochambers in Reddit, I don't agree with it.  If  you can get past this, then you should be looking into the ideas and values they promote.  T_D has a bad reputation thoughout reddit even though no-one goes to find out themselves.  They just take other people's word for it.  Yeah, they can be a bit obnoxious with memes... but whatever.

       Absolute devotion to one leader, anyone who questions them, no matter how long they've been in or how loyal they've been is expelled and demonized. The leader is the only true source, anything negative about them is discounted as fake, as the whole world is against that leader and that leader must be protected no matter what they do, even if that leader admits to or brags about great wrongdoing.

       I've done that before. I was soundly downvoted (not so much in 2X), but not banned. They also don't make claims that they value free speech above all like T_D does. Also, that's pure whataboutism. You can't address what I said so you'll just complain that others do the same.

       Any form of dissent is breaking sub rules. Any questioning of Trump or Trump's actions are grounds for being banned.

       I think they most value the overplayed hand of shareblue continuing to sweep sites and media with panicked narratives -as somewhere in the vicinity of ~0% ever materializes or proves to be remotely accurate.  Evidence is bots and shills push hate hate hate and nothing to do with representing Dems, countering ideas or policies, or offering alternatives.  It's easy to program bots to say mean things or vote manipulate posts and subs -with none other than admin approval.  It would take a LOT more work for a mod or user to manipulate votes, and I don't see that being worthwhile in this case. What'd be the payoff for such an extreme feat?  Or perhaps someone has an exploit for that and I could be wrong. But again, for a site of this magnitude, it most assuredly has safeguards to thwart or at least monitor and alert such activity.

       The mishandling of power, like those 2016 polls in the monopolized media, I believe will teach mankind a lesson in flexing excess power. And technology, we're learning, played a huge roll in this lesson (not that I think excess power should learn from lessons, but enlightens all nonetheless) History shows many examples of blunders in warfare by the side whom are overconfident or on the brink of loss and invoking scorched Earth strategies. Do you suspect someone is pushing an artificial war here and fumbling with their own declaration? Who? It seems yesteryear's tactics didn't work, and some tech-inept elitist pushed a miswired redemption button that had no prepared procedure.  Every day seems to give additional merit to this. I don't see it playing out much longer which is good news for the systematic followers, young people, and our future -in the long run. Ignorance is only bliss when it's not uncovered.

       Maybe I'm wrong.

       I'm not saying those aren't the rules. But it's hard to take some group seriously when they have rules like that and then complain about censorship.

       Banning for breaking sub rules != censorship. Learn the difference
