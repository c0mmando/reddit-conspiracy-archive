        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Most people that are interested in conspiracies spend a lot of time chasing a grand theory. Is it the Illuminati, aliens, Freemasons, the Democrats/Republicans/Communists?</p>

<p>The only problem is, most of us are told so many false things by schools and the media, that we simply don&#39;t have enough facts to decide which theory is correct.</p>

<p>If you want to be able to spot truth vs. falsehood, you have to KNOW things. And that means studying the history of how we got here. Those with a firm grasp on history can sweep away 90% of the rubbish at a glance.</p>

<p>If you don&#39;t know about things like:</p>

<p>-Lord Palmerston</p>

<p>-Cecil Rhodes</p>

<p>-Caroll Quigley</p>

<p>-Freemasonry</p>

<p>-The Council on Foreign Relations</p>

<p>-The Round Table</p>

<p>-The Bilderberg Meetings</p>

<p>-Operation Northwoods</p>

<p>-Operation Condor</p>

<p>-Operation Gladio</p>

<p>-Operation Gladio B</p>

<p>-Operation Cyclone</p>

<p>-Operation Paperclip</p>

<p>-Operation Earnest Voice</p>

<p>-Operation Mockingbird</p>

<p>-MK Ultra</p>

<p>-Phoenix Program</p>

<p>then stop speculating, and learn about ALL of them. They are all confirmed certainties that you can build a worldview on. </p>

<p>If you haven&#39;t even read the wikipedia articles on these, you don&#39;t know enough to have a meaningful opinion. Even better if you&#39;ve spent a few hours on some of the really important ones to understand them in depth.</p>

<p>You have two choices: waste more time speculating and never be certain that you know the truth, or start building a coherent worldview one brick at a time. It&#39;s work, but so it being a slave.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What he listed to research, yes. But those are not theory at that point. When it comes to conspiracy THEORY, the most important thing to realize is that we can never truly determine which is &quot;correct&quot; unless new evidence comes out where the conspirators admit it&#39;s truth. We can make our best guess at what might be going on. We can conclude that said theory is likely. It&#39;s important for us to always keep an open mind. If we tell ourselves that (x) theory is definitively truth, we might miss other information that would lead us even closer to the real truth. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My guess is most people don&#39;t have the time for much more, but at least they are interested and/aware of the overall ideas of conspiracy. The biggest challenge for people with regards to conspiracy is making the leap to believing conspiracy crimes are being committed. These people have opened minds, but just not all the information, so that gives us the opportunity to reach them.</p>

<p>I know several points in my life things got so busy that conspiracy in foreign affairs had to take a back seat. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is a good topic. </p>

<p>One thing I&#39;ve noticed is when the story begins with <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=reports+circulating+in+the+Kremlin">&quot;Reports circulating in the Kremlin&quot;</a>. That means it was written by Sorcha Faal. And that person has been publishing crazy stuff for about 20 years now. The content of the story is always total nonsense and the writing style always follows a distinct pattern. It&#39;s like somebody 20 years ago decided on a template and has used it hundreds of times since. It&#39;s weird. </p>

<p>Another thing is to be aware of is the meta-game at work in the media in general, not just the conspiracy or fringe media. Sometimes a grain of truth does come out accidentally. And it can&#39;t be put back into the secret box. There are people (e.g real journalists and conspiracy whistleblowers) who do receive information from classified sources (and that doesn&#39;t mean military, it can be commercial information too). I believe a lot of what they receive is designed to help confuse that grain of truth that slipped out. </p>

<p>E.g We now have a story in the mainstream media about a company that sells blood from young people to old people, for the purpose of rejuvenation. That story was in the conspiracy media ten years ago. But it was augmented with vampires, ritual child kidnap and blood sacrifice. Those parts kept it out of the mainstream media. Now obviously that company didn&#39;t start overnight and there are a lot of regulations in the medical industry. And obviously it takes a lot of money to get a company through all those regulations from an idea to a service. And it takes a lot of money to pay all the scientists, researchers, engineers, marketers, and executives while you&#39;re not even making any revenue for a decade or more. </p>

<p>My hypothesis is that ten years ago a grain of truth leaked about that company and they paid a PR firm to handle it. The PR firm chose to muddy the waters by adding the vampire, kidnap and blood ritual angles. And the story built it&#39;s own momentum from there. They did that to maintain their commercial advantage and because they had a lot of money at stake. </p>

<p>So when you&#39;re reading a story, try and find the kernel of truth and ignore the extraneous crap.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree that a study of the fairly recent past such as the topics you mention is an important foundation for understanding how the world really works.  Chasing the latest news is nearly worthless in comparison.</p>

<p>The topics you listed are admitted to by the mainstream, but are rarely brought to the attention of most people.  In this way they provide an important bridge for those who will only consider &#39;credible&#39; sources (ie those for whom appeal to authority is not a fallacy).  </p>

<p>Quigley&#39;s work can be really tough to get through (still haven&#39;t finished slogging through Tragedy and Hope myself), but <a href="http://www.joeplummer.com/">http://www.joeplummer.com/</a>  Tragedy and Hope 101 provides a pretty good book report type summary of the important ideas.  One of the most important concepts to break the common world view contained in Quigley&#39;s publications is the exposure of false dialectics, dramas played out at the highest levels where both sides are controlled by the same people (democratic politics is basically fake).</p>

<p>I would add to your list a study of mass psychology and anthropology.  Bernays&#39; &#39;Propaganda&#39; isn&#39;t too long, but has important insights into how the masses are manipulated.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think that&#39;s what I love about conspiracy theories the most. It helps you realize how much information you were taught was true without any real backing to the information. I love stepping outside the box and entertaining even the wildest of theories. It&#39;s an enlightening process.</p>

<p>But, I think, at best we can only determine that a conspiracy theory is likely. We can&#39;t say definitively that it is fact/truth, and to do so might hurt our ability to fully see and process other information that comes out on a theory. To do so might lead to confirmation bias. </p>

<p>Now, if a conspiracy theory is determined to be true by the persons involved in said conspiracy admit to it on top of all the evidence, its no longer theory and just becomes conspiracy crime. Those things we can accept with a greater degree of certainty. </p>
