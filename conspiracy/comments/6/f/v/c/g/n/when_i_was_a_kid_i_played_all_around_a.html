        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>These days, It seems to be unheard of for children to play outside without adult supervision. The days of kids riding their bike around town, in the woods, etc. seem to be long gone. I feel this is mostly because of the media coverage of all the &quot;crazy&quot; people that have caused parents to be more cautious and protective of their children. With all the forms of communication and tracking available to parents you figure it would be quite the opposite. </p>

<p>When I was a kid, I played in my neighborhood pretty much from sun up to sun down. My parents could only contact me by landline or hoping I was close enough to hear them yell for me. I was typically with other kids, but we were still in a neighborhood that was far from 100% safe. </p>

<p>Are people really that much crazier now?  Are small town crimes not as easily covered up as they once were? Has the media conditioned parents to believe that kids must be supervised at all times? </p>

<p>My theory..
The media/government has conditioned parents to provide constant supervision to their kids, and this has resulted in children being conditioned for a life of constant surveillance and supervision being the norm. </p>

<p>Thoughts? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, well, back in the day the world was <em>a different</em> place. Most were not aware of &#39;the game being played&#39; upon them. Most people just accepted what was told to them &amp; believed MSM. There was no internet, violence in media wasn&#39;t that bad unless you went to the movies. It SEEMED innocent but I think it was because people were &#39;ignorant&#39;.</p>

<p>IMO, the Cabal has succeeded in the dumbing down of the population. A lot of &#39;basics&#39; were lost. Everything is worse; parents, education &amp; with social media taking over, (smh) just forget about it. Even the AIR, food &amp; water isn&#39;t the same! The squeeze is on (the vise is tightening), it&#39;s up to those that ARE aware to try to let people know what&#39;s coming. If they&#39;re not ready/don&#39;t want to listen; oh well, ya can&#39;t save everyone.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think it is intentional as such but I agree that it is a result of conditioning. The old adage &quot;if it bleeds, it leads&quot; is a result of news organisations noticing that headlines involving crime get more attention. So our news is full of stories about crime, regardless of how much of an actual impact it has on our lives.</p>

<p>This means that people&#39;s perception of crime has become disjointed from reality. Surveys constantly show that people who regularly consume the news media believe crime is much more common than it actually is. The effect of this is to make people more afraid of becoming a victim of crime than they really should be.</p>

<p>The upshot of this is that parents are happier to keep their children in the house rather than let them go out into the world where they are apparently surrounded by constant danger.</p>

<p>Interestingly, this may be leading to another unexpected consequence:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Other parts of the world have also seen a dramatic increase in the condition, which now affects around half of young adults in the United States and Europe — double the prevalence of half a century ago. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>....</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This threat has prompted a rise in research to try to understand the causes of the disorder — and scientists are beginning to find answers. They are challenging old ideas that myopia is the domain of the bookish child and are instead coalescing around a new notion: that spending too long indoors is placing children at risk. “We&#39;re really trying to give this message now that children need to spend more time outside,” says Kathryn Rose, head of orthoptics at the University of Technology, Sydney.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We are slowing turning ourselves into mole people, because like the moles we&#39;re afraid of going out into the open because we might get eaten by a predator.</p>

I&#39;ve been letting my child ride her bike to school on her own in the mornings and today I asked her to ride the bus.  the reason?  one of my neighbors sent me a link to the sex offender registry list showing photos of three different men that live in my neighborhood. I think having the information changed my parenting decisions.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am not at all criticizing you, but it brings up a good point.  The perverts were always out there.  Technology just has opened up a window to where they are as well as the news reports of perversion thousands of miles away.  So before, we were blissfully unaware.  Sure, rumors were around about some weird old guy or some hobos.  But now, we know anyone who has been charged and are to be feared.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>sounds creepy but thats a very broad charge. probably not kid touching or even kiddie porn. It is definitely scary and i would worry too, but the history of violence could be completely unrelated.

    <div class="md"><p>What&#39;s crazy is back in the 70s kids were <em>waaaay</em> crazier and savvier - watch any docs about Youth Gang culture in most major cities or even fucking <em>Stranger Things</em>. When that show was trending I saw a lot of pearl-clutching about how the bullies were carrying knives and dealing out beat downs - plenty of people were saying &quot;there weren&#39;t any kids like that back in the 70s/80s!&quot; Well, I&#39;m here to tell you: yes; there absolutely were. Kids didn&#39;t fuck around back then. So paradoxically, we had more freedom when kids were allowed to get wild, get into scrapes, and live to tell the tale. Remember, <em>any kid that tells on another kid is a dead kid</em>.</p>

<p>I miss the 70s. :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>One can also argue that CPS has gotten wayyyy too much authority. And awake or not, any parent in this generation knows that this government arm can easily take their child away from them.</p>

<p>You can&#39;t trust your neighbors anymore. A fair amount of people will straight up report you before talking over their concerns with the parent first( warranted or not)
Whether its 24 hours or for months, I can only imagine how horrifying it would be for the child and the parent to separated (when the parent is perfectly capable of raising the child)</p>
