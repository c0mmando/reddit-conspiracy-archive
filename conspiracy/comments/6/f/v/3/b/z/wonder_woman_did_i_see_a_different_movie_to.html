<p>The reason this is in r/conspiracy is because unless standards for good movies has dropped massively lately I believe that the positive reaction is a result of widespread press manipulation and dare I say it.. shilling.</p>

<p>Being mostly new to conspiracy could I get some advice on established manipulation techniques and tactics, where to look, what I&#39;m looking for. The likes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree</p>

<p>I think WW was a step in the right direction, but I&#39;m suuuuuper skeptical about Justice League</p>

<p>The DC Universe was never my favorite.  I loved their limited series, Watchmen, V for Vendetta, some of the Batman stand-alone stories, etc.  Their regular series, though, left something to be desired</p>

<p>I mean, really, the problem is that all of the DC superheroes, are essentially gods, except Batman.  The superheros in Marvel have for more limited powers and more human qualities.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I cringed when they announced it, but he&#39;s actually really good as batman,</p>

<p>if he would just stay in the suit...</p>

<p>but damn, even with the suit on, looking at him, i still just see Affleck as Batman and not just Batman.</p>

<p>but I think they generally made really good casting choices, the only one that&#39;s bad IMO is Will Smith as deadshot.. just can&#39;t take that shit seriously.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Studios want to make money. Lots and lots and lots of money. They have big focus meetings where they discuss how a film can appeal to the widest audience possible. -- Personally, I liked Wonder Woman but I get what you&#39;re saying. Big studios don&#39;t make movies for audiences anymore, they make them for statistics. This % of white people will see this movie, this % of women will like this movie because of a % of this, etc etc. The military industrial complex has had their hands in Hollywood since the 50s so this is nothing new.b</p>

<p>I loved comic books for decades, but decades of being let down with comic movies has left me with low expectations. I like these types of movies if they basically don&#39;t deviate too far from the source material, and are fun to watch.</p>

<p>If I walk away thinking the movie was actually GOOD, then the movie FAR exceeded my expectations.</p>

<p>I would suspect that others are in a similar boat and (from what I heard and read) this movie meets their minimum standards.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Movies are now made to appeal to a global audience,  Including China. Therefore the movies is watered down in terms of story line and script so that it is easier to dub voices in. Also china heavily censors movies so the movies also must make sure to avoid themes of independence or rebellion against the government in order to get past censorship. Movies have become so boring in the past ten years. Thank the globalists that use it to push their agenda.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This movie is undoubtedly a ploy by the country that shall not be named to help their public image and then they tack on the idea that it has great feminist ideals etc. They are losing bds, people are able to watch the horrific videos of their sociopathic actions, they can&#39;t lie and manufacturer false flags fast enough.</p>

<p>Also while I generally will check rotten tomatoes, I do not, not watch a movie bc of bad reviews. I&#39;ve seen many movies that were great that got horrible reviews. I&#39;m sorry I don&#39;t remember one of the top of my head but I def recall telling my wife that the poorly rated movies had anti establishment politics in them</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I haven&#39;t seen it, but my discerning friends have said it&#39;s decent but overlong and if all the previous recent DC movies hadn&#39;t sucked so bad, people wouldn&#39;t be raving. </p>

<p>The press manipulation is a true fact, but I think it might have as much to do with how big movie ads are one of the few things the newspapers can rely on. Shilling and virtue signaling plays a part too. &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; was a much bigger example of critics giving a shitty movie good reviews because of political correctness and fear of backlash. &quot;Wonder Woman&quot; at least seems like a decent movie, if over-rated.</p>
