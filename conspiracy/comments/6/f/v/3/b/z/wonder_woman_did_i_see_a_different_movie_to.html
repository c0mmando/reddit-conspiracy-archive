       The movie I so saw was a copy paste action movie including all the tired old cliches. It had a couple great themes that could have been explored but weren't.
      </p>
      <p>
       The reason this is in r/conspiracy is because unless standards for good movies has dropped massively lately I believe that the positive reaction is a result of widespread press manipulation and dare I say it.. shilling.
      </p>
      <p>
       Being mostly new to conspiracy could I get some advice on established manipulation techniques and tactics, where to look, what I'm looking for. The likes.

       from what I heard it's pretty much just a copy of Captain America, the 1st one.

       it does have good reviews though, no idea why, DC movies have traditionally sucked.

       the current DC universe films has been horrendous though.. I think Man of Steel is actually the first superhero film where I had no desire to finish watching, and still haven't.

       I agree
      </p>
      <p>
       I think WW was a step in the right direction, but I'm suuuuuper skeptical about Justice League
      </p>
      <p>
       The DC Universe was never my favorite.  I loved their limited series, Watchmen, V for Vendetta, some of the Batman stand-alone stories, etc.  Their regular series, though, left something to be desired
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean, really, the problem is that all of the DC superheroes, are essentially gods, except Batman.  The superheros in Marvel have for more limited powers and more human qualities.

       i think the problem is DC movies have too much studio interference, whereas Marvel Studio the comic book people generally have more control.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not sure about Justice League either, but I think I'm gonna watch it no matter what just cuz.

       I cringed when they announced it, but he's actually really good as batman,
      </p>
      <p>
       if he would just stay in the suit...
      </p>
      <p>
       but damn, even with the suit on, looking at him, i still just see Affleck as Batman and not just Batman.
      </p>
      <p>
       but I think they generally made really good casting choices, the only one that's bad IMO is Will Smith as deadshot.. just can't take that shit seriously.

       I loved MoS, been collecting Supe comics for over 25 years. Seen a variety of Story lines from cheesy to dark. I thought it was a good take on the mythos. Saw Wonder Woman and absolutely loved it as fan. BvS and SS not so much

       Studios want to make money. Lots and lots and lots of money. They have big focus meetings where they discuss how a film can appeal to the widest audience possible. -- Personally, I liked Wonder Woman but I get what you're saying. Big studios don't make movies for audiences anymore, they make them for statistics. This % of white people will see this movie, this % of women will like this movie because of a % of this, etc etc. The military industrial complex has had their hands in Hollywood since the 50s so this is nothing new.b

       You have a point there I hadn't thought of. The formula I'm tired of seeing may be new to an audience that doesn't watch action movies. If like to see the numbers on who went to see this movie compared to past DC and other movies.

       That's also partly why there are so many remakes/reboots. Already built in viewers means even it bombs, there's less chance not at least making the money back.

       You do realize that the studio does not get all of the $129M. The movie will undoubtedly make money, but will be shown on paper to be another loser or break-even movie at best. Accounting in Hollywood is a racket.

       It's too early to tell if it's a blockbuster. As far as expectations, I have no idea what the studio's were. In these days, I'd consider a Blockbuster to be something that has $1B+ in worldwide ticket sales. Hell the last F&amp;F movie did over $500M worldwide in the first week. Now that's a blockbuster.

       I think it met the expectations of those who ACTUALLY wanted to see it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I loved comic books for decades, but decades of being let down with comic movies has left me with low expectations. I like these types of movies if they basically don't deviate too far from the source material, and are fun to watch.
      </p>
      <p>
       If I walk away thinking the movie was actually GOOD, then the movie FAR exceeded my expectations.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would suspect that others are in a similar boat and (from what I heard and read) this movie meets their minimum standards.

       Or they dislike it because they don't understand it until much later.  Problem is, if it doesn't win awards or get decent box office, studios won't have the data.  They will see those movies as bad for business and stick to the same formulas.

       Movies are now made to appeal to a global audience,  Including China. Therefore the movies is watered down in terms of story line and script so that it is easier to dub voices in. Also china heavily censors movies so the movies also must make sure to avoid themes of independence or rebellion against the government in order to get past censorship. Movies have become so boring in the past ten years. Thank the globalists that use it to push their agenda.

       This movie is undoubtedly a ploy by the country that shall not be named to help their public image and then they tack on the idea that it has great feminist ideals etc. They are losing bds, people are able to watch the horrific videos of their sociopathic actions, they can't lie and manufacturer false flags fast enough.

       Also while I generally will check rotten tomatoes, I do not, not watch a movie bc of bad reviews. I've seen many movies that were great that got horrible reviews. I'm sorry I don't remember one of the top of my head but I def recall telling my wife that the poorly rated movies had anti establishment politics in them

       I haven't seen it, but my discerning friends have said it's decent but overlong and if all the previous recent DC movies hadn't sucked so bad, people wouldn't be raving.
      </p>
      <p>
       The press manipulation is a true fact, but I think it might have as much to do with how big movie ads are one of the few things the newspapers can rely on. Shilling and virtue signaling plays a part too. "Ghostbusters" was a much bigger example of critics giving a shitty movie good reviews because of political correctness and fear of backlash. "Wonder Woman" at least seems like a decent movie, if over-rated.
