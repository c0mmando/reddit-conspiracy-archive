       Hi all,
I am a mid thirties man of Jewish descent who lives in America.  I don't practice Judaism but I do respect my roots.  I love a good conspiracy.  I often come here as soon as a "terror" event happens looking for signs of a false flag.  I believe there is waaaay more to 9-11 than what was reported in the MSM.  I am open and lean towards a belief that there is life on other planets and that our government has proof of it.  I see chemtrails often and wonder what they are spraying.  I believe Israel and the U.S. have conniving/dirty governments and are involved in lots of shady endeavors.  I probably stop short of a lot of you do with some conspiracies, not because I don't believe in them, but more so because I believe many of them are impossible to prove and notice that my quality of life drops considerably if I get too invested.
I don't judge anyone for going deep though, I appreciate it.
      </p>
      <p>
       What prompted me to write this is mixed in with all the juicy conspiracy on this sub is hate speech directed towards Jews.  Talking about how we are "leeches" "baby-eaters" and about how we "control" everything.  Let me be clear I know a lot of Jews who hold all kinds of jobs throughout the states and throughout the world.  We don't control shit.  Am I saying there aren't powerful groups of Jews who are in charge of banks and have other holdings?  No.  Sure there probably are just like there are groups of Christians and Muslims.  Maybe the Jewish groups are more insidious.  But I for one don't have any more connection to those people than I do to Donald Trump or Ariana Grande or Montgomery Burns.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm sure there are some of you out there who just hate all Jews, me included.  And that sucks, but it is what it is.  Who I'm trying to address here is the people who have problems with groups of Jews but maybe are on the fence about individuals.  To you I say, if you can be more specific in your language we can actually be allies.  Thanks for your time.
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT:  Thank you for all of your comments that contributed to a stimulating conversation.  I apologize for not being crystal clear in my original post.  I gained more clarity as it went on and believe my basic question could be summed up as: I am of Jewish descent, based on that alone does this community have a problem with me?
       <br/>
       The answers I received varied from:  no (mostly got this one), to I don't care, to yes, to no but you have a heightened responsibility.  I appreciate all of those as well as all of the other talking points.  I particularly appreciate this comment: " I would bet most here dont think that DNA makes you evil,"  as I haven't always felt that way, but now I do.

       That sucks. You should do a march to support to support awareness of the inequalities amongst Jews... this has gone on too long. All Jews should be able to eat babies and control everything. #Babies4AllJewz

       You poor guy. Oppressed for your entire life to the point where you don't even see the difference in privilege level amongst Jews to be a problem. We need to have more progressive thoughts about Jews... there should be a baby on
       <em>
        every

       I urge people to call out specific individuals, or Zionism, or specific instances or events constantly. Using blanket statements like, "The Jews" doesn't help any argument and can derail conversation very quickly.

       You see though, how any collectivist term is usually bad for the discussion? Personally i'm not very caring of anyone's safe space sensibilities, but im concerned the the more we throw these labels around, the easier it becomes to shift the blame and sway the discussion. "The americans are bombing x" holds no one accountable, while "NATO forces from 19th Air Support Squadron are bombing x" might. Yes this is a dumb example, but speaking in particular terms whenever possible seems a lot more helpful than tossing out blanket statements and not batting an eye. And i also say this because getting us to label eachother has been a longstanding tactic in their game of divide and conquer against humanity.

       Yes, in the same way I see the issue with writing a post claiming "hate speech" while citing no specific examples of it, and forcing conversation like this one, perpetuated in vague generalizations about some phantom of "anti-Semitism" that the OP simply insists the existence of a priori.

       Perhaps we could benefit still. Use these discussions to shine a spotlight on this societal meme. Why do entire subject matters of historical and cultural importance become taboo under the threat "antisemitism"? Why do westerners fear that word compulsively? Why do they perceive it as being far more serious than garden variety racism? 
Personally i find this thread interesting because most jews i know are very ignorant of the bigger picture, and even the "woke" ones seem incredibly reticent to discussing the failings of jewry with a goy :l must be some form of cultural mind control, where the collective is to be protected at all costs, even if they themselves must suffer in silence.

       I do think it's an interesting discussion, even if I take issue with the way OP framed it. I think the Jewish press, which has maintained power in the West, particularly America, for well over a century, not to mention the American entertainment industry, has controlled the narrative to such a degree that the special status of "anti-Semitism" as an extreme form of racism has become cemented as an off limits stigma in Western culture. The very direct political confrontation of the Jewish question by the NSDAP, and the subsequent political exploitation of the situation by the Jewish press, made the Western goyim all the more receptive to the conditioning.

       Yeah. Jews have been pretty much babied on the world stage since ww2, and are increasingly taught that anything can be construed as an attack on all jewry. I wouldn't be surprised if some of the "real" antisemites are planted by the controlling jews themselves in order to more easily coopt the rest of the normal jewish populations into supporting zionism... a "phantom of antisemitism" indeed. Like crying terrorist... Or homophobe..

       well fuck, my PhD thesis is out the window. We are not all nutters her Jewvacado111. We just see that for their fair share of the global population Jews seems to amass more power and tend to be involved in Cronyism, Nepotism, Back Handedness and Sneak Thievery in a great number. This isnt due to any sort of genetic superiority, but because the religion itself allows for deception for economic gain.

       Saying the Jews are responsible for Israel's/ the World's evil is equivalent to saying Christianity is responsible for the US's evil. Ideology is used to push an agenda, and it's only one method of bringing about that agenda.

       the people who are responsible for the evils of Israel are Zionists and jewish. "the Jews" refers to jewish people, but not all jews are Zionists. Like if you called the KKK "the Whites" because they are all white.

       Not like that at all, actually, when you consider that 94% of American Jews support the state of Israel. Mind telling me what percentage of American whites support the KKK? Let me know when you come up with some stats.

       if israel suddenly disappeared tomorrow, that would be a tragedy. i'm not even jewish and i can agree with that. (personally, i think it's too late to just 'get rid' of israel, and the solution is just to stop funding them and giving them weapons)

       Fair enough. This might be a more reasonable statistic, from a Pew Research study. It shows that 69% total American Jews show some level of attachment to Israel.

       It's not though. Judaism is a religion, but not one necessarily practiced by members of what's considered the Jewish "ethnicity," while Christianity does not have a similar ethnic definition.

       Talmudic Zionism is Islamic Extremism, is the KKK. They're different flavors of the same fear driven hatred of those unlike the practitioner. The religion is just the vessel through which the evil agenda of a small elite group can come to fruition.

       It's not only religious Jews who decide the fate of the masses. Is Janet Yellen a "religious Jew"? You are claiming (through bare assertion and without any evidence, I might add) oversimplification, but you yourself are engaging in a more absurd generalization and nonsensical conflation of disparate ideologies.

       Don't forget the Talmud and how it says Christ boils in his own shit in Hell.  Imagine the kind of person that could believe such a thing about a man who preached nothing but tolerance, humility and peace.  An intensely loathsome, black-hearted, self-serving person, I assure you.

       I think it should be Jewvocado111 technically.  I don't think you are all nutters.  I understand your criticisms of Jews and I largely agree.  My question to you is, how does all this color how you all feel about me as an individual of Jewish ancestry who doesn't practice Judaism and calls out much of the same things within the world that you do?

       How i feel about you... Hm. I believe you have a big responsibility as a jew. Your whole nation has a calling to be the "priesthood" of Christ. Moreover, the "synagogue of satan" that usurps your name and kills your people should see more resistance from real jews and less complicity from within... Tell me, what do you think about the political zionism that pervades western media? How do you feel being protected by the weaponized "mainstream public opinion" on one side, all but untouchable to the cry of "antisemitism!", while on the flipside, the rest of the world seems to openly hate you for all the crimes committed in your name?

       i may be missing something, but judaism and christianity are almost the same religion, barring the new testament part? so then does not also the Christian religion allow for deception for economic gain? yet such analysis on christians rarely appears here.

       He's referring to the talmud, which has some pretty evil and manipulative teachings.  The Torah, and the rest of the old testament has some pretty evil stuff too, but not in the same insidious way.

       but see, he doesn't specify what he means. That I think is what OP was getting at.

      <p>
       The sentence "Zionists are destroying the world because of the Talmud" (just an example sentence) means something very different than "Jews are destroying the world because of their religion"

       found this. Maybe it will be useful (i havent read all of it yet) 
From what i remember, some jews allow themselves "mental reservations" much like the jesuits. This is how many religious societies justify their scummy ways

       the new testament includes the story of jesus, parables (mainly life lessons), and the letters of the various disciples. can you explain what part of the NT makes christians good and jews bad? (besides killing jesus, which was not nice of them).

       -The implementation of and strict enforcement of "anti-Semitism" laws, of which the effect is to stifle debate about this subject

       If the above facts cannot be discussed, as it appears u/Avocado111 would have, then I have a problem. I have no animus towards any individual, Jew or gentile, if they haven't themselves done something worthy of derision. But I'll be damned if I'm going to allow the quest for truth to be obfuscated in the interest of political correctness, if only someone perceives my skepticism of Jews as a group as something other than healthy distrust based on substantiated evidence of the group's historical record.

       Not all Jews who are up to no good are dedicated "Zionists." I'm still not sure which comments you are referring to, but if, for example, I state that "the Jews" overwhelmingly control the information disseminated in the press, you can assume I'm talking about the Jews that are influential in the press, who may or may not be Zionists. It should also be obvious that I'm not including you, assuming you don't fit the description of "influential in the press," even if you happen to be a Jew.

       I've seen a lot of it. I've asked different people for evidence of their claims that a list of Jewish politicians are "Dual citizens with Israel." When they had none they accused me of being JIDF and said stuff like, "I'm just a stupid goyim, right?"

       Also seen plenty of stormfront articles here and the word "kike" more than a couple times. I report it and move on, but I'm not going to pretend it's not a problem, especially as it gives ammo to groups whose only purpose is to troll this sub.

       Well, to be honest with you, even if I take you at your word, and I have no reason to doubt you outright, it couldn't mean less to me. As long as this place represents a forum for free discussion, it wouldn't bother me in the least that a few racist comments pop up every once in a while. I actually wouldn't even care if you perceive me, personally, as a racist. The only way we will ever be able to ascertain the truth behind anything is if this place remains completely devoid of "thought-policing." And the only way anyone here will ever make a difference is by ascertaining truth.

       Hey OP, don't mind the idiots... Keep trucking along on your truth seeking journey...
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's something that might appease your mind (or not)... I believe most of the anger towards jews coming from here when talking about TPTB is that a lot of them are jewish.. But like all religions there's different branches and stuff like that (I'm no expert). Well most of them have roots in Talmudic Zionism apparently, which would make sense considering the sickos they are lol. Bonus fun fact: Wahhabism was created when a talmudic zionist "converted" to islam. Basically made the same shit but around islam. And now we have ISIS

       I don't care who runs it as long as the information is not misleading, can you show me where they're making things up? Some of the data isn't 100% up to date, but that doesn't change much.

       Then it doesn't count as data, and cannot be presented as evidence - especially when the data itself is supposed to supply the narrative.

       Data is data, your conclusion is retarded, because it still supports the narrative.

       you have an example of a bit of outdated data, more specific: The Chairman of the FED, it's not Ben Shalom Bernanke anymore, an Ashkenazi Jew, now it's Janet Yellen, an Ashkenazi Jew. Who's the Vice Chairman now? Stanley Fischer, another Jew. The People may change, but the Jew stays. They are way overrepresented, you can check the data yourself if you don't want to believe what's on the list, I'd be interested in your findings if you find out that Jews don't run most of what is on that list, I'll give you reddit gold, buy you a beer, whatever, I'm 100% sure you can't refute the evidence, so try it and very good luck you goyishe kop!

       I would describe them as power driven, and comfortable around their own, likely wary of others. If I had a problem with them I wished to address, I would use first and last names, or company names. You choose to hold the title you have, you choose the company you work for, but you cannot choose the life into which you are born. Don't punish based on the sins of the father; judge individuals for their actions.

       I understand what you're getting at, I just have too many non practicing Jewish friends who couldn't care less about Israel or their agenda to believe that having Jewish parents makes you evil.

       I asked for a specific case of someone in this sub claiming all Jews are evil because of their parentage. Can you cite it or not? A single one? If you can, you've been paying more attention than I have because I have literally never seen that assertion.

       You're correct, the assertion has never been made, even by me. People here claim "The Jews," as a whole, are evil. I do not believe this to be true. To support my claim, I posited that one isn't necessarily evil just for the life into which they are born. To be born, one typically needs parents. If two parents are Jewish, and have a child, that child is typically Jewish by default; same generally goes for Christians, Muslims, Pagans, Rastafarians, Pastafarians, and pretty much any other religion in the history of forever. You took my words and twisted them, and fixated the irrelevant.

       Hang out here any day and you'll see at least one post about it. Two-three weeks ago the sub had a serious uptick in virulent antisemetic posts, and one user noted that Reddit users' comments on those posts were being archived by someone. I'm not sure what your end game is here? I'm not implying the sub is antisemetic as a whole, because it isn't, just that the posts show up here. I'm of the opinion it's done deliberately in an attempt to suppress any hope this sub has at maintaining a positive image.

       Perhaps you should read the rest of his paragraph then. I'm not saying he believes everyone hates all Jews, I'm saying he's directing this at r/conspiracy specifically because he obviously feels that he saw some extreme anti-semitism and he's making it sound like it happens fairly often here. There's clearly an implication that this community in particular is anti-Semitic and quite frankly, that's bullshit. I just see jokes "oy vey!" and whatnot. Nothing about Jews eating babies.

       The heritage of these "elites" seems to come from Jewish and ancient Egyptian times, and probably further back.  But Anglo and Jewish agendas have become so intertwined now, that they seem inseparable.  I'm about as white as white can be, but that won't stop me from speaking out against the crimes that my race (and yours) are committing against fellow humans.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't hate Jews.  I speak out against Jewish heritage, and it's written history of racism, genocide, hatred, and manipulation of the "goy" to their own selfish ends.  "White" leaders are just as guilty of it now, but the heritage and legacy of is Jewish/Egyptian origin, and dancing around that fact doesn't help anyone.

       The recurring reasons seem to always contain a combination of these: 
- Using debt-based businesses and banking to subvert the economy of the host country.
- Refusing to answer to the authority of host country, either in secrecy or by systemic infiltration.
And of course, the fun one:
- Kidnapping and vampirizing the children of their host country.

       I don't think so. I think people are brainwashed by religion and that loaning money isn't inherently evil. It certainly isn't comparable to raping a defenseless girl. That's ridiculous hyperbole.

       No, I don't believe your all on the gravy train, but don't come here and try to downplay jewish power in the US and try to float the idea that there is an equivalent of goy and muslims. Adjusted by % of the population, you don't have an argument.

       This is a copy pasta from a post I made about a month ago on antisemitism... I hope it contributes to this topic.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        I am pretty sure it [antisemitism] is a trap for people who get close to the truth. There was an effort during the election to brand anti-globalism as a code for anti-semitism. I think that is a REALLY big hint.
       </p>
       <p>
        The concept of everything being the fault of "the jews" is intentionally reductive, because such simplified ideas are naturally appealing. This serves well to catch anyone going down the rabbit hole in a sort of gravity well that will get them branded a racist/nazi/antisemitite.
The Truth is that there are a subset of people, some of which are jewish, who control a ridiculous number of very important industries and hold a great deal of political and financial control. They aren't exclusively jewish though, but there are enough that you can point to it as a trend and people will go in that direction.
       </p>
       <p>
        There is a massive difference between the little old lady who lives down the road and Mossad. Yet you see that anyone who is critical of Israel's influence on domestic or global politics, on either side of the political aisle, get branded with the antisemitic label.
       </p>
       <p>
        Are you Critical of Israel's treatment of Palestinians? ANTISEMITE!
       </p>
       <p>
        Are you wary of the influence that global bankers and hedge fund managers hold over our politicians? ANTISEMITE!
       </p>
       <p>
        Ever notice that nepotism runs rampant in the media and in Hollywood? ANTISEMITE
       </p>
       <p>
        Have you ever asked the wrong questions about WWII? ANTISEMITE!
       </p>
       <p>
        Are you a gentile who laughed a little too hard at a Mel Brooks movie? ANTISEMITE
       </p>
       <p>
        All I can say is don't fall into the trap because it is designed to invalidate anything you say. Do I think this is a jewish conspiracy? No, I don't. I think it is simply a form of political expedience that has worked effectively for more than a century, so why would you stop? It is no different from how the left ran the word "racist" into the ground for people who work against their agenda, except the antisemite label apparently has longer legs.
       </p>

       All that said, instead of blaming nebulous groups of people, name specific names. That is what TPTB don't want you to do.

       How do you feel about the following post by Glen Compton?
I really appreciate it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am pretty sure it [antisemitism] is a trap for people who get close to the truth. There was an effort during the election to brand anti-globalism as a code for anti-semitism. I think that is a REALLY big hint.
The concept of everything being the fault of "the jews" is intentionally reductive, because such simplified ideas are naturally appealing. This serves well to catch anyone going down the rabbit hole in a sort of gravity well that will get them branded a racist/nazi/antisemitite. The Truth is that there are a subset of people, some of which are jewish, who control a ridiculous number of very important industries and hold a great deal of political and financial control. They aren't exclusively jewish though, but there are enough that you can point to it as a trend and people will go in that direction.
There is a massive difference between the little old lady who lives down the road and Mossad. Yet you see that anyone who is critical of Israel's influence on domestic or global politics, on either side of the political aisle, get branded with the antisemitic label.
Are you Critical of Israel's treatment of Palestinians? ANTISEMITE!
Are you wary of the influence that global bankers and hedge fund managers hold over our politicians? ANTISEMITE!
Ever notice that nepotism runs rampant in the media and in Hollywood? ANTISEMITE
Have you ever asked the wrong questions about WWII? ANTISEMITE!
Are you a gentile who laughed a little too hard at a Mel Brooks movie? ANTISEMITE
All I can say is don't fall into the trap because it is designed to invalidate anything you say. Do I think this is a jewish conspiracy? No, I don't. I think it is simply a form of political expedience that has worked effectively for more than a century, so why would you stop? It is no different from how the left ran the word "racist" into the ground for people who work against their agenda, except the antisemite label apparently has longer legs.
All that said, instead of blaming nebulous groups of people, name specific names. That is what TPTB don't want you to do.

       So, If I may boil down all the blubidblub of your extended post, you are a Jews who is butt hurt because people on this sub sometimes claim that Jews own and control the media, control the money supply, control the universities and think tanks, control Congress, and control the justice system. I suggest you kick your shoes off, make some nice herbal tea, and listen to relaxing music with your eyes closed. You'll feel better after a few minutes.

       Will you interject in the comments about how his commentary makes for a poor reflection on all the good Jews?

      <p>
       This is the issue. I, for one, do not think all Jews are evil…but if you can sit back and allow those to whom you feel connected/aligned to spout such hateful rhetoric without uttering a word in condemnation then perhaps you are…forgive me…a hypocrite.
