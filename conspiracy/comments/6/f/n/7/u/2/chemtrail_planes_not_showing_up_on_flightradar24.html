       To wake up my friends and family to the truth of chemtrails, when a plane spraying chemicals flies over I show them that there's no flight data for that plane posting on flightradar24. Normal commercial flights with their (contrails) all showing up on flightradar24 but not the mysterious planes poisoning all of us.

       I live under one of the busiest skies in Europe and contrails fill the sky from one horizon to the other on some days. Other days not a single one. It's due to the weather, not some sinister spraying program. Check any aircraft and it'll be on Flightradar, but not always in real time. In the US the data is delayed by 5 minutes so the aircraft making the contrail you see in the sky won't appear on screen for a while.

       King-Hell, no disrespect brother, but I know the difference between a contrail that comes from an engine and chemicals being sprayed from a plane. In fact, I have recorded them several times turning the sprayers on and off!  Not sure where you heard it is delayed five minutes but I can literally see the plane approaching my house and go outside and sure enough, there's the plane. It appears to be real time. The fact no data shows up for the planes I'm referring to just reinforces the notion that these planes are part of the military/deep state and they answer to no one. Have you watched the video "What on Earth are they spraying"?

       I've been paying attention to chemtrails and contrails for 10 years now. There is a hige difference between the two and anyone who denies it has not looked up and studied the sky or a daily basis for an extended period of time. For anyone saying I need to see it to believe. This is it.

       The claim that contrails dissipate but chemtrails persist is an often-repeated myth. Contrails last as long as conditions allow. Let me educate you a bit.... Jet fuel is very similar to paraffin (kerosene); it is a hydrocarbon - a complex mix of carbon and hydrogen. When it burns in air it breaks apart and the carbon combines with oxygen to expand into carbon dioxide gas (CO2) and the hydrogen combines with oxygen to form water (H2O). These two reactions give off a great deal of heat energy. 1 kilo of aviation fuel combines with oxygen to produce about 1.2 kilos of water which boils instantly into 1,600 litres of superheated steam. It is these rapidly expanding hot gases which push the aircraft forward. At high altitudes where the temperature is minus 50 degrees the steam will freeze into tiny ice crystals almost instantly. If the air is dry the crystals will disappear in seconds, but if the air is saturated with water vapour then the crystals will grow many times in size into snowflakes through a process called deposition
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deposition_(phase_transition)">
        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deposition_(phase_transition)
       </a>
       and can last for hours or even days in a distinct formation. This is a contrail. It does not require any sinister chemicals to make it form. How long a contrail lasts depends on temperature, pressure, and humidity, and nothing else. A 747 burns around 11 tons of fuel per hour, which convert to around 13 tons of ice, which is around 24 kg per mile. It is a tiny amount compared with the thousands of tons of ice in a contrail, but only 0.003% of the water in a persistent contrail comes from the burnt fuel; the other 99.997% is from the atmosphere itself. If you are willing to look at the evidence it's not hard to see how a jet liner spewing fire and ice can leave a huge spectacular cloud behind it.

       "With the jet engines of nowadays it's almost impossible to form a persistent contrail. You need unique atmospheric conditions for that. First, the airplane needs to be above 30,000 feet. The temperatures have to be below minus 40 degrees Celsius, and you have to have a relative air humidity of 67 percent. But that's hardly ever the case. So what you see today, with the whole spectrum from the horizon filled with contrails from planes flying at different altitudes, is impossible. That's science. So there must be another reason for it." - Willem Felderhof, former KLM pilot (3)

       Does anyone have a legitimate argument that contradicts this quote? It's a great quote, but I have no basis to verify anything he said. But I've had the exact same thought before while looking up at the sky. Multiple planes will be visibly 10,000 or 20,000 feet lower than one another, and all have persistent trails. With my limited knowledge, that doesn't make any sense.

       Complete bullshit. I don't believe this idiot has even been on an airplane. Googling him just leads to a bunch of conspiracy sites all linking to each other in a circle. I am a former Royal Navy aircraft engineer. I understand how jet engines work. High bypass jet engines produce bigger contrails than old turbojets due to the higher relative humidity of their cooler exhaust gases.

       Ok, then my question to you is; what about the "contrails" that turn from a tic-tac-toe pattern to a completely hazy overcast covering the entire area of the trails? Is this something that can be explained and demonstrated
       <br/>
       in these distinct formations? Asking you honestly, because I'm no specialist like you seem to be, but I have heard other specialists say that's not normal for condensation trails.

       Yes it can be explained. The atmosphere isn't consistent. There are areas of dry air mixed with wet air (just look at clouds). Sometimes these different areas form into bands (Mackerel clouds?) because that's what nature does. If a plane flies through these bands of dry/wet air it will leave a contrail in the wet bit but not in the dry. And so you will see a stop-start pattern appear.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am not an expert, just an interested observer (retired journalist) who 'looked up' many years ago and asked "What the fuck is going on?". So I went and found out. There was nothing behind the chemtrail claims, but there was a simple scientific explanation for every single 'undeniable' claim made for it.  Then I realised the true extent of what is happening and decided to weigh in on the debate. I am horrified by the proposals for geoengineering. Pumping sulphides and barium and strontium into the upper atmosphere is insane. But that's not 'chemtrails' whatever the people here claim.
      </p>
      <p>
       And the danger from those long white clouds in the sky isn't that they're poisonous, but they are altering the weather. Calling them chemtrails just trivialises them into the loony brigade arena. Here is George Monbiot on chemtrails obscuring the real issue of contrails

       Let me repeat myself again. The planes that I personally have observed spewing large white plumes zig zagging across the sky are NOT commercial airliners. If they were they would be showing up on flightradar24 and their flight plans would be published. So by your above comment KingHell, it sounds like you are agreeing there are active geoengineering activities in place that include barium and strontium which is exactlly what a lot of the chem-trail claims have said. So what exactlly are you disagreeing with here?

       Geoengineering schemes mostly focus on the Stratosphere, the area of sky above about 60,000 feet (at the equator) up to 160,000 feet. Stratospheric Aerosol Injection is being tested at the moment by firing chemicals way up in the Stratosphere at about 80,000 feet. The recent experiments by NASA involved sending barium and strontium up much higher into the Ionosphere at 120 miles altitude. Clearly there is no connection between these schemes and the stuff coming out of aircraft which are flying at a maximum height of 40,000 feet.

       The reason why you sometimes don't see the plane on flightradar is because those planes don't have ADS-B receiver intalled in them. Not all of the planes are shown on that radar. I think I readed somewhere that the plan is to install that receiver in all of the planes by 2020. Oh and yeah, the persistent (con)trails are almost always left by commercial airplanes. Actually when I watch what kind of weather is expected at around 30 000ft above my town, I also know if I will see persistent contrails or not

       Dude...this topic tends to be rather polarizing. I get it. If they are spraying shit on the population (and I know they are) then this is the biggest conspiracy of them all. The fact so many can't see it or are willing to come to terms with it speaks volumes about how thorough TPTB conditioning of the population has been. Again, I know very well what makes contrails and why they exist. This is not the subject of debate. What is at debate is why aren't the planes that are spraying the actual chemicals showing up on flightradar24? Are you going to tell me that only military planes that are using a fuel that creates these long lines of persistent lingering aluminum clouds?  Because the fact is NONE of the commercial airliners are spewing this shit, only unmarked planes with no flight plan listed are doing it. And lets not ignore the fact that soil and water samples ALL OVER are coming up with concentrations of aluminum and barium that could NEVER occur naturally in the environment. How can you possibly not see the truth here bud? Also, I find it strange how they are just now proposing atmospheric aerosol injections, as if they haven't been doing it all along...

       Many aircraft do not show up on those programs. Many corporate operators pay to have their tailnumbers blocked. This prevents anyone from seeing this aircraft on flight tracking software. Another reason they would not show up is that the aircraft is being operated  without opening a flight plan.

       Every flight above 18,000 needs a clearance. The plane is on a flight plan, but as he said, you can pay to have your flight plan and other information blocked from public flight trackers.

       Most commercial pilots don't take the chem-trail conspiracy seriously, and it's honestly a joke to most of us also. At the very worst what you could be seeing are solar radiation management flights.

       Ok, I get that some planes have info blocked, but the plane still shows up on flightradar24. As in, I can see the plane about to fly over my house, and it also shows the altitude. 100% of the time when I see planes doing the 'ole loop around and around filling the sky with white smoke, the information is ALWAYS missing. I don't think that's being conspiratorial. I think that is legit something to say, hey, there's something going on here. Now to your point about it being Solar radiation Management. It very well might be. Or it could be substrate needed for HAARP to modify weather, or who knows what it is. All I know is as a citizen of the United States I should be afforded the right to breath fresh air without a bunch of crap in it. If I even thought about dumping a couple cans of old paint in the forest they would lock me up and put me under the jail! This is a gross injustice being perpetrated against the masses and I for one am mad as hell about it as should anyone that gives a crap about life, the Earth, or their families.
