       Tom Cruise is batshit crazy and does his own crazy stunts. Maybe it's because he knows he can't die and has the power of Xenu!
      </p>
      <p>
       He's even showing us this in his movies. Live, Die, Repeat, and the scene in the trailer for the new mummy when he dies in the plane crash but wakes up in the morgue.
      </p>
      <p>
       What if this is really the way things are and he's trying to indirectly tell us?!

       Well man look. There are certain abilities that a human can unlock, most religions were initially founded around the instructions for how to unlock them. I'm not too familiar with Scientology but perhaps the highest levels of their order have refined these instructions and Tom would obviously have access to that.
      </p>
      <p>
       He may be able to astral project, self-heal, sense others thoughts/motivations, psychically view remote areas, speak to 'beings' to gain knowledge/insight/wisdom/etc...
      </p>
      <p>
       And yes, he might be bragging about this through his movies.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you understand the various cycles that are described by many ancient texts you will understand that in certain periods of human history almost everybody could do these things and emotional telepathy was commonplace enough.
      </p>
      <p>
       We are at the shit-end of these cycles where these powers are very hard to obtain compared to the golden-end where they are taken for granted because the cosmic environment is such that it's impossible not to obtain them.
      </p>
      <p>
       He may understand reincarnation enough to know that he is immortal. Most of us can only guess about it unless you have the abilities I talked about above.

       No.  Just no.  Scientology is truly evil.  They use forms of hypnosis and brainwashing to secure membership.  They suck their members dry until they have no fight, no emotions, no sense of self, and no more money.  Their "clergy" are treated like slaves to pamper and defer to celebraties like Cruise.  Last but certainly not least, their own Messiah admitted that Scientology was a sham.  Not to mention he was a lying sack of s#*% and a complete fraud.  Sorry this got so long, but you hit a nerve of mine.  Please don't worship Cruise.  He does not deserve it.  He knows what Scientology does to families, and yet he continues to turn a blind eye to their criminal activities.  Not to mention he hasn't seen his own daughter in three years because she and her mother have been declared suppressed persons.  That is sick!

       Live, Die, Repeat was based on a manga. It's not his idea. 
He's just picking interesting scripts and seems to be really into sci-fi because of his religion. He's done a lot of different movies.

       Every time Cruise does a death-defying stunt in one of his movies, he loses a quarter of an inch off his height. It's the penalty the god of Scientology, L. Ron Hubbard, exacts from him for allowing him to appear superhuman.
