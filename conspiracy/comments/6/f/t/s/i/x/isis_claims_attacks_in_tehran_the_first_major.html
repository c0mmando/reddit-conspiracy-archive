       Not to mention this directly follows Iran electing by all accounts a "moderate," reformist president in an actual democratic election (of course, their Islamic Republican maintains from the top down, but clearly there's wiggle room the Saudis and the UAE do not have).
      </p>
      <p>
       This is an alarming development that should not be brushed off. There's plenty of debate to be had about who's destabilizing who/chicken vs egg/"good" vs "evil" in the tumultuous Middle East. I can't shake the idea that whoever has undertaken these Tehran attacks have probably been planted in the country for some time, ready to be activated when the time is right. This is the path to real war, and we already know which side the Trump admin has chosen. Things don't get better from here on out.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm now focused on this suppressed terrorism-funding investigative report the UK has produced-- that should be leaked, or at least pressured for its release.

       Or an attempt to trigger a larger conflagration, possibly that could spread to North America.  Large scale conflict on domestic soil is pretty much the only way for policy and civil liberties lockdown to happen on scale in a short timeframe.  It's the key that opens the door to the repressive state.  Avoiding it is desirable.

       Genuine question... If Trump has denounced Iran as one of the biggest sponsors of terrorism, but they were just attacked for the first time in decades by ISIS, how could he argue for intervention there? It seems like a double edged sword..

       Great point. Absurdist contradictory positions are defining the Trump presidency on a daily basis, so no surprise there. As for Iran, whom are they alleged to support? I figured it was Hamas and Hezbollah, maybe current Al Queda?
      </p>
      <p>
       Meanwhile, there's Putin-- Litvinenko was claiming he was propping up Al Queda in the early 10's, and Russian Intel has long been suspected of escorting southern extremists from the country ahead of the Sochi Olympics, and they all ended up as ISIS in Syria, where Russia currently has an alliance with Iran. None of it really makes sense.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm sure a lot of this comes down to the good old Israeli/Palestianian conflict and the radical shift in support the Trump admin has undertaken in a short period of time.

       Probably not. Iran has enough on their plate right now. One of the things people don't seem to realize is that this war has been really, really hard on Iran. Something like hosting 1 - 2 million refugees internally.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is in addition to being in and out of various levels of sanctions from different parts of the international community based solely on attempts at becoming a nuclear power...
      </p>
      <p>
       The support of Shia organizations like Hamas and Hezbollah is quite a bit different from supporting random terror organizations (Both the above groups are pseudo-state actors, I think Hamas is currently the ruling party in Palestine? And Hezbollah has a history of controlling a large portion of Lebanon)

       Iran was providing material assistance to the Sadrist in the Iraq War, and that resulted in a slight splinter group of those that supported Iranian SGs and those that did not.

       I'm not trying to insinuate that I believe his statement that they sponsor terror and I have yet to see any proof of those claims... I'm just wondering how he could argue for intervention/wanting to stop ISIS's expansion into Iran when he's already stated that they're the biggest sponsor of terror. He would have a hard time convincing people that US intervention is necessary in a country that he's already labeled as terrorist sympathizers. He would also have to explain why the terrorists are attacking the country that's supposedly provided them with funding which might bring the bigger question of whether or not Iran really is the biggest sponsor of terrorism, etc. It's a lose-lose either way.

       It doesn't really matter... the core of the trump supporters only care about what he says and does today, even if it completely contradicts anything he has said before.

       Or he'll just spin it to say that the Iranian government must be working with ISIS and created the attack so they could seem like they are not on the side of the terrorists.

       I'm the last guy alive who'd defend Trump cultists, but more ME war must be avoided at all costs. Particularly when Mr. "Holy War" Bannon and Erik Prince, with his security contracts with the Gulf states are in the picture. Guess what bipartisan America, escalation of ME bloodshed is not going to cure terrorism, it will boost it exponentially.
