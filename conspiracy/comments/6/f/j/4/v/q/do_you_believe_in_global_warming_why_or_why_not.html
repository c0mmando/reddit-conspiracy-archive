Anyone who denies the weather of 30 or 20 or even 10 years ago is different from today is a partisan fool, a paid politician or an oil lobbyist.  The climate has absolutely changed.  What people fail to understand is that it&#39;s not just flooding and drought that we will experience.  It will be unprecedented war for resources, disease &amp; wide scale famine if we don&#39;t get this under control.  Even if there is a slight chance that it&#39;s not man-made which science tells us it is, was it worth it not to try to fix it?  I guess we&#39;ll be asking that decades from now when this house of cards comes tumbling down. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>co2 does not emit it&#39;s own radiation. It can only absorb it from outside sources. Other greenhouse gases, such as methane and carbon-monoxide,  also do this and are much more harmful to our eco-system. Reducing gases like those, as well as bringing man made radiation down is key in helping our planet. Turning the focus to a gas that&#39;s prime manufacturer is our lungs and is already naturally in our ozone is counter productive.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not really. Getting a PhD in a hard science taught me enough not to believe much in most &quot;scientist&#39;s&quot; work. It&#39;s all about your career and grants and spin and very little of anyone&#39;s work ever actually makes a shred of difference. In fact the &quot;99% of scientists agree&quot; should be the first major clue that something is wrong. Everything in science should be up for questioning. The fact climate change isn&#39;t suggests it really isn&#39;t about science at all but more about power and money. The other reasons are I know how bad mathematical models of the future can be and that we only recently started studying this phenomenon with any precision. So for me while I think it&#39;s possible, I think it&#39;s just another fad like Y2K or the ozone or global cooling or overpopulation or recombinant DNA fear mongering ... humans always need someone screaming the sky is falling. </p>

<p>As someone who&#39;s an engineer and considered the academic route, who wife is actually <strong>in</strong> academia along with many friends that stayed and through her, I can pretty much guarantee you <a href="/u/bleepul">/u/bleepul</a> is a liar. His blatant misrepresentation of the Scientific method tells me that the only thing he&#39;s ever been a student of is &quot;The Blaze&quot; and &quot;Breitbart&quot;. </p>

<p>Let me spell it out. Mr. &quot;PhD&quot; does not understand the difference between a <code>Hypothesis</code> and a <code>Theory</code>. In the 1970&#39;s Climate Change was a Hypothesis. And a that time, you could make the argument that no one can agree. But no we have had decades of data that closely matches the Hypothesis, so now it&#39;s a widely accepted Theory. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, the Earth has been warming. But that does not mean that humans have anything to do with it. Given the current geography of Earth and stage of the Milankovitch cycle we expect that the planet has settled around a climate mean that varies naturally due to competing feedback mechanisms. For instance, warmth increases evaporation over time leading to an increase in cloud cover that leads to natural cooling. Milankovitch cycles play a role in overturning the current climate regime on the order of thousands of years. Within those cycles climate varies around a mean on the order of hundreds of years. Within those hundreds year periods are the short term modifiers such as ENSO. What we conclude is that climate is dynamic rather than (more or less) static as AGW insists. Climate may only effect the thin skin and atmosphere of Earth, but that is still a very large area that takes time to warm and time to cool. Feedback mechanisms can&#39;t shift temperature trends quickly.</p>
