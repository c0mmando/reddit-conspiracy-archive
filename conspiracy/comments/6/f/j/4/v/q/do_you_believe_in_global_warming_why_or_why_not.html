       I believe humans, over the course of the last few hundred years in particular, have begun accelerating the warmth of the planet as an unexpected consequence of our technological advancements.

       Even if one doesn't believe in global warming, I don't understand the argument of renewable resources. I definitely believe they're the right choice for our future, for our planet, economies, and jobs.

       The worlds climate could start changing for worse or get better. The climate has changed so many times on this planet with and without us. Let's at least utilize the technology and sustainability we do know and ride out our portion of it.

       Renewable resources are magnitudes more expensive than fossil fuels and natural gas. Utilizing them too early puts an economic strain on the populace.

       It is scalable, but large corporations are only now considering it. It's very difficult to make a premium off the sun as there is no scarcity.  Scarcity is the ultimate chess piece of the current old economic model.

       I believe some of our practices are more than likely doing damage to our Earth but I don't believe in Global Warming. Simply put, because the "Globe" isn't "Warming." Average Earth temperature has only raised 1 degree over the last 80 yrs. And that could just be due to natural cycling.

       I've spent a decent number of years on this earth.  Anyone who denies the weather of 30 or 20 or even 10 years ago is different from today is a partisan fool, a paid politician or an oil lobbyist.  The climate has absolutely changed.  What people fail to understand is that it's not just flooding and drought that we will experience.  It will be unprecedented war for resources, disease &amp; wide scale famine if we don't get this under control.  Even if there is a slight chance that it's not man-made which science tells us it is, was it worth it not to try to fix it?  I guess we'll be asking that decades from now when this house of cards comes tumbling down.

       The difference is, you're using straw man arguments and I'm not. I'm using facts, and actual data backed by scientists the world over.
      </p>
      <p>
       Science is not a consensus to truth argument. That describes
       <em>
        politics
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       It only takes
       <em>
        one
       </em>
       alternate modeling theory to discredit another theory based on simulated models. That's the part you're not understanding. All the straw man
       <em>
        fear
       </em>
       is based on computer models - models that
       <em>
        if originally true as Al Gore predicted
       </em>
       would have already melted the Arctic ice cap. See, this is fear. Not science.

       1) Your original reply was to a guy that wasn't presenting any arguments at all. Purely discussing the topic at hand and providing his own anecdotes. He doesn't reference any particular models or anything. In fact the core of his argument is, why shouldn't we try to fix this while we can?

       I believe in climate change because I am capable of basic reasoning. CO2 traps heat. More CO2 means more heat. Human activity is increasing the amount of CO2. To deny that global warming is happening, you have to deny some pretty basic scientific facts.

       I'm not generally a fan YouTube videos of crackpots. Why don't you humor me and tell me which part you don't believe in? CO2 absorbs and emits infrared radiation. CO2 levels in the atmosphere have increased dramatically since the industrial age. These are easily verifiable facts. I don't understand how anyone could call it a hoax. Unless maybe this guy is employed by a conservative think tank that pushes pseudoscience to benefit their donors.

       co2 does not emit it's own radiation. It can only absorb it from outside sources. Other greenhouse gases, such as methane and carbon-monoxide,  also do this and are much more harmful to our eco-system. Reducing gases like those, as well as bringing man made radiation down is key in helping our planet. Turning the focus to a gas that's prime manufacturer is our lungs and is already naturally in our ozone is counter productive.

       Not really. Getting a PhD in a hard science taught me enough not to believe much in most "scientist's" work. It's all about your career and grants and spin and very little of anyone's work ever actually makes a shred of difference. In fact the "99% of scientists agree" should be the first major clue that something is wrong. Everything in science should be up for questioning. The fact climate change isn't suggests it really isn't about science at all but more about power and money. The other reasons are I know how bad mathematical models of the future can be and that we only recently started studying this phenomenon with any precision. So for me while I think it's possible, I think it's just another fad like Y2K or the ozone or global cooling or overpopulation or recombinant DNA fear mongering ... humans always need someone screaming the sky is falling.

       and a
       <code>
        Theory

       . In the 1970's Climate Change was a Hypothesis. And a that time, you could make the argument that no one can agree. But no we have had decades of data that closely matches the Hypothesis, so now it's a widely accepted Theory.

       name calling? ha. You know what a real Harvard PhD would do? He would use well sourced facts and logic to disprove me. Because that's what they teach. They teach you how to use your brain. You just talk out your ass, pretending your some intellectual. Well sorry buddy, I know smart people. I work with them. I'm friends with them. By your lack of linguistic depth, simple grammar, and inability to use logic, I'd be surprised if you even have a HS diploma. PhD is some Internet fantasy you use to hide behind authority.

       Let's bet money bub.  Let's compare credentials. Your "engineering" degree (I am guessing a BS from a state school) and your wife's "academic" degree (I am guessing maybe a Masters in Psychology and she teaches part time at the local community college) versus mine.  You called me out so let's find out who has the better education.

       That website that you link to that appears so "scientific" is exactly what I was referring to in my OP. It's all about agendas and power. Who's it run by? A dude name John Cook. Who does Jon Cook work for? An organization that exists solely to push this information on the public. John Cook got his PhD LAST YEAR in WESTERN AUSTRALIA in COGNITIVE SCIENCE. It is impossible to see it as anything other than propaganda ... even if the science were right it is being used utterly and completely wrong.

       Climate changes can only be detected on scales of decades as anything less is just weather variability.  I don't believe the models have shown valid predictive power.
      </p>
      <p>
       10000 years ago North America was frozen.  Then it melted.  700 years ago the climate went cooler again.  The climate's been warming ever since.  Yet, it still is not as warm now as previous eras had.  There was no massive disaster then.  Yes the North Pole is losing ice, but the south pole is gaining ice.  There is no pending massive disaster.

       What interests me is that Global Warming seems to be a millennialist apocalyptic religion, right down to the indulgence.  When the year 1000 rolled around, people were told God was angry, and pay money to make up for it.  When the year 2000 rolled around, people were told God was angry, and pay money to make up for it.

       Of course global warming is real. The question is how much are humans adding to it. If you say CO2 is increasing the temperature then no ones proved that yet as it's gone up 30% since the industrial revolution but temperatures are still well within the margin of error.

       I agree that the climate changes and I'm open to the possibility that man has had a major role in that. I think that there is more research to be done including expanding the scope of the research to have better measurements.
      </p>
      <p>
       I disagree with the proposals on how to combat it from the elite and the corrupt governments that have hijacked the cause to license greater control over the population. I feel it's counteractive to real progress and innovation that would lead to advancements in clean energy by exerting more government control and handicapping the economic growth​ that would enable it by paying $100billion a year to get more regulations.

       Yes, the Earth has been warming. But that does not mean that humans have anything to do with it. Given the current geography of Earth and stage of the Milankovitch cycle we expect that the planet has settled around a climate mean that varies naturally due to competing feedback mechanisms. For instance, warmth increases evaporation over time leading to an increase in cloud cover that leads to natural cooling. Milankovitch cycles play a role in overturning the current climate regime on the order of thousands of years. Within those cycles climate varies around a mean on the order of hundreds of years. Within those hundreds year periods are the short term modifiers such as ENSO. What we conclude is that climate is dynamic rather than (more or less) static as AGW insists. Climate may only effect the thin skin and atmosphere of Earth, but that is still a very large area that takes time to warm and time to cool. Feedback mechanisms can't shift temperature trends quickly.

       You admitted to having nothing more than an undergraduate psychology degree and no formal education in physics, so it makes sense that you wouldn't understand the physics involved in climate systems. So why do you continue to try to convince others of these things? You've been shown to be wrong over and over again according to dozens of different sources (including many provided by you, when you either didn't read them before sharing them or didn't actually understand what they were saying).
