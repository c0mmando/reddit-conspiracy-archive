       I'm so sick of the fucking praise being doled out lately to war criminals murderers and drug runners.
      </p>
      <p>
       That TIL on front page was a fucking disgrace. But hey you know he skydived  at 90!? Anything's possible with a healthy supply of young blood I suppose.
      </p>
      <p>
       I hate reddit sometimes
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: a couple people have become upset over this post because there is no conspiracy here. Apologies- my intent was not to make a garbage shit post.
      </p>
      <p>
       My point is that the TIL seems like an operation to change manipulate perception amongst users by highlighting an alleged heroic act by a horrendous human being thus covering up his actual nature.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not to mention in the actual post if you sort by controversial, anyone who made a comment about his shady past got downvoted to oblivion.

       Im certain a decent section of those would also 'love to have a beer with him'. And discuss what? Im sure he'll be able to relate his world domination struggle, assassinations and occult sex rituals to your network administrator job.

          Conspiracy of Silence, a documentary listed for viewing in TV Guide Magazine was to be aired on the Discovery Channel, on May 3, 1994. This documentary exposed a network of religious leaders and Washington politicians who flew children to Washington D.C. for sex orgies.     Many children suffered the indignity of wearing nothing but their underwear and a number displayed on a piece of cardboard hanging from their necks when being auctioned off to foreigners in Las Vegas, Nevada and Toronto, Canada.     At the last minute before airing, unknown congressmen threatened the TV Cable industry with restrictive legislation if this documentary was aired. Almost immediately, the rights to the documentary were purchased by unknown persons who had ordered all copies destroyed.     A copy of this videotape was furnished anonymously to former Nebraska state senator and attorney John De Camp who made it available to retired FBI Agent Ted L. Gunderson. While the video quality is not top grade, this tape is a blockbuster in what is revealed by the participants involved.     See for yourself...

       I prefer Gore Vidal's term of "Crypto-Nazi" that he hung on William F. Buckley because of all the false pretenses and patriotic nonsense these creatures spout and hide behind to obscure just how thoroughly rotten and criminally-minded they actually are. Real Nazis don't run and don't hide, they're proud of being the villainous and ruthless shits that they are.

       What to see Mr. Intellectual get his ass kicked by a younger upstart? I just discovered this and now I fully get why people think Noam Chomsky is so brilliant....  I also know why I never saw Chomsky on TV or even heard of him until the internet.

       Trust me people older than Sponge Bob knew who Noam was before the internet.  Manufacturing Consent was was in every left wing kids back pack in the late 80s. Anyone with an above room temperature IQ knew of him for his ire against the oppression and slaughter in East Timor.

       I was there and I did not know who he was. I recall hearing the term "Manufacturing Consent," but not who popularized it. So no, I don't TRUST YOU. :)

       I watched television and Noam Chomsky was not on it and not mentioned on it at any significant level. You know who I remember seeing on TV all the time -- and on "liberal" PBS for that matter? Mr. William Buckley.

       In essence every bully is a coward, but not every coward is a bully.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nazis exist and take a great delight in bullying and cowing others into obedience with the threat of violence or death if they don't comply. How they behave when they don't have the upper hand or when the odds aren't in favor is different matter. Prescott Bush was a closet Nazi as was his son and grandson. They pursue the same kind of political ends and business advantages for themselves that the Nazi regime in Germany provided, only through surreptitious and clandestine means.

       i am aware of operation paperclip. what i mean  is the depth and intensity that these scientists had invested in being a "good Nazi" it one thing to go along with your government when you have no other choice (as in work for us or we kill your family) its completely different to buy into whole cloth an evil system. could you really blame them for going along? that's like holding the drone makers of today responsible for every drone attack in Yemen. i doubt that von Braun was a "good NAZI" he just wanted to get to the moon

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The General Atomics MQ-1 Predator is an American remotely piloted aircraft (RPA) built by General Atomics and used primarily by the United States Air Force (USAF) and Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). Initially conceived in the early 1990s for aerial reconnaissance and forward observation roles, the Predator carries cameras and other sensors but has been modified and upgraded to carry and fire two AGM-114 Hellfire missiles or other munitions. The aircraft, in use since 1995, has seen combat in war in Afghanistan, Pakistan, the NATO intervention in Bosnia, Serbia, Iraq War, Yemen, Libyan civil war, the intervention in Syria, and Somalia.

       Given there were approximately a thousand or so targets of Paperclip, and some of them WERE found to be "good NAZIs", then yeah, 435435435 is right to have said they run to Argentina or NASA.

       The US, UK and USSR were all out shopping for NAZI brains post WWII.

       The Tarpley book is available to view for free on his website. Here's an excerpt from Chapter 23, "The End of History"
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The Bush regime thus took shape as a bureaucratic-authoritarian stewardship of the financial interests of Wall Street and the City of London. Many saw in the Bush team the patrician financiers of the Rockefeller Administration that never was. The groups in society were to be served were so narrowly restricted that the Bush administration often looked like a government that had totally separated itself from the underlying society and had constituted itself to govern in the interests of the bureaucracy itself. Since Bush was irrevocably committed to carrying forward the policies that had been consolidated and institutionalized during the previous eight years, the regime became more and more rigid and inflexible. Active opposition, or even the dislocations occasioned by administration policies were therefore dealt with by the repressive means of the police state. The Bush regime could not govern, but it could indict, and the Discrediting Committee was aways ready to vilify. Some observers spoke of a new form of bonapartism sui generis, but the most accurate description for the Bush combination was the “administrative fascism”.
       </p>
       <p>
        Bush’s cabinet reflected several sets of optimizing criteria.
       </p>
       <p>
        The best way to attain a top cabinet post was to belong to a family that had been allied with the Bush-Walker clan over a period of at least half a century, and to have served as a functionary or fund-raiser for the Bush campaign. This applied to Secretary of State James Baker III, Secretary of the Treasury Nicholas Brady, Secretary of Commerce Robert Mosbacher, and Bush’s White House counsel and top political adviser, C. Boyden Gray.
       </p>
       <p>
        A second royal road to high office was to have been an officer of Kissinger Associates, the international consulting firm set up by Bush’s lifelong patron, Henry Kissinger. In this category we find Gen. Brent Scowcroft, the former chief of the Kiss Ass Washington office, and Lawrence Eagleburger, the dissipated wreck who was named to the number two post in the State Department, Undersecretary of State. Eagleburger had been the president of Kissinger Associates. The ambassadorial (or proconsul) list was also rife with Kissingerian pedigrees: a prominent one was John Negroponte, Bush’s ambassador to Mexico.
       </p>
       <p>
        Overlapping with this last group were the veterans of the 1974-77 Ford Administration, one of the most freemasonic in recent US history. National Security Council Director Brent Scowcroft, for example, was simply returning to the job that he had held under Ford as Kissinger’s alter ego inside the White House. Dick Cheney, who eventually became Secretary of Defense, had been Ford’s White House chief of staff. Cheney had been Executive Assistant to the Director of Nixon’s Office of Economic Opportunity way back in 1969. In 1971 he had joined Nixon’s White House staff as Don Rumsfeld’s deputy. From 1971 to 1973, Cheney was at the Cost of Living Council, working as an enforcer for the infamous Phase II wage freeze in Nixon’s “Economic Stabilization Program.” The charming Carla Hills, who became Bush’s Trade Representative, had been Ford’s Secretary of Housing and Urban Development. William Seidman and James Baker (and Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan, a Reagan holdover who was the chairman of Ford’s Council of Economic Advisers) had also been in the picture under Jerry Ford.
       </p>
       <p>
        Bush also extended largesse to those who had assisted him in the election campaign just concluded. At the top of this list was Governor John Sununu of New Hampshire, who would have qualified as the modern Nostradamus for his exact prediction of Bush’s 9% margin of victory over Dole in the New Hampshire primary –unless he had helped to arrange it with vote fraud.
       </p>
       <p>
        Another way to carry off a top plum in the Bush regime was to have participated in the coverup of the Iran-contra scandal. The leading role in that coverup had been assumed by Reagan’s own blue ribbon commission of notables, the Tower Board, which carried out the White House’s own in-house review of what had allegedly gone wrong, and had scapegoated Don Regan for a series of misdeeds that actually belonged at the doorstep of George Bush. The members of that board were former GOP Senator John Tower of Texas, Gen. Brent Scowcroft, and former Sen. Edmund Muskie, who had been Secretary of State for Carter after the resignation of Cyrus Vance. Scowcroft, who shows up under many headings, was ensconced at the NSC. Bush’s original candidate for Secretary of Defense was John Tower, who had been the point man of the 1986-87 coverup of Iran-contra during the months before the Congressional investigating committees formally got into the act. Tower’s nomination was rejected by the Senate after he was accused of being drunken and promiscuous by Paul Weyrich, a Buckleyite activist, and others. Some observers thought that the Tower nomination had been deliberately torpedoed by Bush’s own discrediting committee so as to avoid the presence of a top cabinet officer with the ability to blackmail Bush by threatening to bring him down at any time. Perhaps Tower had overplayed his hand. In any case, Dick Cheney, a Wyoming Congressman with strong intelligence community connections, was speedily nominated and confirmed after Tower had been shot down, prompting speculation that Cheney was the one Bush had really wanted all the time.
       </p>
       <p>
        Another Iran-contra veteran in line to get a reward was Bush’s former national security adviser, Don Gregg, who had served Bush since at least the time of the 1976 Koreagate scandal. Gregg, as we have seen, was more than willing to commit the most maladroit and blatant perjury in order to save his boss from the wolves. The pathetic drama of Gregg’s senate confirmation hearings, which marked a true degradation for that body, has already been recounted. Later, when William Webster retired as Director of the CIA, there were persistent rumors that the hyperthyroid Bush had originally demanded that Don Gregg be nominated to take his place. According to these reports, it required all the energy of Bush’s handlers to convince the president that Gregg was too dirty to pass confirmation; Bush relented, but then announced to his dismayed and exhausted staff that his second and non-negotiable choice for Langley was Robert Gates, the former CIA deputy director who had been working as Scowcroft’s number two at the National Security Council. The problem was that Gates, who had already dropped out of an earlier confirmation battle for the CIA director’s post, was about as thoroughly compromised as Don Gregg. But at that point, Bush’s could not be budged a second time, so the name of Gates was sent to the senate, bringing the entire Iran-contra complex into full public view once again. As it turned out, the Bush Democrats in the Senate proved more than willing to approve Gates.
       </p>
       <p>
        Still on the Iran-contra list was Gen. Colin Powell, whom Bush appointed as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. After Vice Admiral John Poindexter and Oliver North had departed from the Old Executive Office Building in November, 1986, Reagan had appointed Frank Carlucci to lead the NSC. Carlucci had brought along Gen. Powell. With Colin Powell as his deputy, Carlucci cleaned up the stables of Augeias of the OEOB-NSC complex in such a way as to minimize damage to Bush. Powell was otherwise a protege of the very Anglophile Caspar Weinberger, and of Carlucci, a man with strong links to Operation Democracy and to the Sears, Roebuck interests.
       </p>
       <p>
        The State Department, too, had its Iran-contra coverup brigade. First came Thomas R. Pickering, chosen by Bush to take over his old post as US Ambassador to the United Nations, a job with cabinet rank. When Pickering was US Ambassador to El Salvador during the 1984-85 period, he helped arrange shipment of more than $1 million of military equipment to the contras, all during a time when this was forbidden by US law, according to his own testimony before the Congressional Iran-contra investigating committees. Pickering did not report any of his doings to the State Department, but instead kept in close touch with Don Gregg, Felix Rodriguez, and Oliver North of Bush’s retinue. Pickering, when he was ambassador to Israel in 1985-86, was also in on Israeli third-country arms shipments to Iran that were supposed to secure the release of certain hostages held in nearby Lebanon. [fn 4] This vulgar, gun-running filibusterer is now the arrogant spokesman for Bush’s New World Order among the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council, where he dispenses imperial threats and platitudes.
       </p>
       <p>
        Still on the Iran-contra coverup honors list we find Reginald Bartholomew, Bush’s choice as Undersecretary of State for security affairs, science, and technology. Bartholomew was US Ambassador in Beirut in September-November 1985, when an Israeli shipment of 508 US-made TOW antitank missles was followed by the release of Rev. Benjamin Weir, an American hostage held by the pro-Iranian Islamic Jihad. According to the testimony of then Secretary of State George Shultz to the Tower Board, Bartholomew was working closely with Oliver North on a scheme to use Delta Force commandoes to free any hostages not spontaneously released by Islamic Jihad. According to Shultz, Bartholomew told him on September 4, 1985 that “North was handling an operation that would lead to the release of all seven hostages.” [fn 5]

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Other choice appointments went to long-time members of the Bush network. These included Manuel Lujan, who was tapped for the Department of the Interior, and former Rep. Ed Derwinski, who was given the Veterans’ Administration, shortly to be upgraded to a cabinet post. A prominent figure of Bush’s first year in office was William Reilly, tapped to be administrator of the Environmental Portection Agency, the green police of the regime. Reilly had been closely associated with the oligarchical financier Russell Train at the US branch of Prince Phillip’s World Wildlife Fund and the Conservation Foundation.
       </p>
       <p>
        So many top cabinet posts were thus assigned on the basis of direct personal services rendered to George Bush that the collegial principle of any oligarchic system would appear to have been neglected. There were relatively few key posts left over for distribution to political-financial factions who might reasonably expect to be brought on board by being given a seat at the cabinet table. Richard Thornburgh, a creature of the Mellon interests who had been given his job under Reagan, was allowed to stay on, but this led to a constant guerilla war between Thornburgh and Baker with the obvious issue being the 1996 succession to Bush. Clayton Yeutter went to the Department of Agriculture because that was what the international grain cartel wanted. The choice of Jack Kemp, a 1988 presidential candidate with a loyal conservative-populist base, for Housing and Urban Development appeared inspired more by Bush’s desire to prevent a challenge from emerging on his right in the GOP primaries of 1992 than by the need to cater to an identifiable financier faction. The tapping of Reagan’s Secretary of Education, William Bennett, a leading right wing ideologue and possible presidential prospect, to be Drug Czar, is a further example of the same thinking. The selection of Elizabeth Hanford Dole to be Secretary of Labor was dictated by similar intra-GOP considerations, namely the need to placate the angry Republican Minority Leader, Sen. Bob Dole of Kansas, a darling of Dwayne Andreas of Archer-Daniels-Midland and the rest of the grain cartel.
       </p>
       <p>
        Later reshuffling of the Bush cabinet has conformed to the needs of getting an intrinsically weak candidate re-elected, especially by accentuating the southern strategy: when Lauro Cavazo left the Department of Education, he was replaced by former Tennessee Governor Lamar Alexander. When Bennett had to be replaced as drug czar, the nod went to another Republican former southern governor, Bob Martinez of Florida. All of this was to build the southern base for 1992. When Thornburgh quit as Attorney General to run for the senate in Pennsylvania in the vain hope of positioning himself for 1996, Bush tapped Thornburgh’s former number two at Justice, William P. Barr, who had been a CIA officer when Bush was CIA director in 1976, for this key police-state post.
       </p>
       <p>
        But all in all, this cabinet was very much an immediate reflection of the personal network and interests of George Bush, and not representative of the principal financier factions who control the United States. We see here once more the very strong sense of national government as personal property for private exploitation which was evident in Bush’s oil price ploy of 1986, and which will soon characterize his choreography of the Gulf crisis of 1990-91. This approach to cabinet appointments could give rise to a surprising weakness on the part of the Bush regime, should the principal financier factions become disaffected in the wake of the banking and currency panic towards which Bush’s policies are steering the country.
       </p>
       <p>
        Bush’s shameless exploitation of political appointments and plum jobs for blatant personal advantage became a national scandal when he began to assign certain ambassadorial posts. It became clear that these jobs of representing the United States abroad had been virtually sold at auction, with the most flagrant disregard for qualifications and ability, in return for cash contributions to the Bush campaign and the coffers of the Republican Party. These appointments were carried out with Bush’s approval by a transition team of GOP pollster Bob Teeter, Bush’s campaign aide Craig Fuller, who had lost out on his bid to be White House chief of staff, campaign press secretary Sheila Tate, and long-time Bush staffer Chase Untermeyer. Calvin Howard Wilkins Jr., who had given over $178,000 to the GOP over a number of years, including $92,000 to the Kansas Republican National State Election Committee on September 6, 1988, became the new ambassador to the Netherlands. Penne Percy Korth was Bush’s selection for ambassador to Mauritius; Ms. Korth was a crack GOP fundraiser. Della M. Newman, tapped for New Zealand, had been Bush’s campaign chiarman in Washington state. Joy Silverman, Bush’s choice for Barbados, had contributed $180,000. Joseph B. Gilderhorn, destined for Switzerland, had coughed up $200,000. Fred Bush, allegedly not a relative but certainly a former aide and leading fundraiser, was the new president’s original pick for Luxemburg. Joseph Zappala, who gave $100,000, was put up for the Madrid embassy. Melvin Sembler, another member of Team 100, was tapped for Australia. Fred Zeder, a Bush crony who had already been the ambassador to Micronesia, was nominated for the Overseas Private Investment Corporation, despite a congressional probe of alleged corruption [fn 6]
       </p>
       <p>
        As with any group of rapacious oligarchs, the Bush cabinet was prone to outbreaks of intestine factional warfare among various contending cliques. During the first days of the new administration, Bush’s White House counsel Boy Gray was hit by reports that, despite his high government positions over the recent years, he had retained a lucrative post as chairman of the board of his family’s communications company, raising the clear problems of conflicts of interest. Gray thereupon quit his chairman’s post and, following Bush’s own example, put his stock into a blind trust. Gray then lashed out against Baker by leaking the fact that Baker, during all his years as White House chief of staff and Secretary of the Treasury, had kept extensive holdings of Chemical Banking Corp., a lending institution that had a direct interest in Baker’s handling of debt negotiations with third world debtor countries within the framework of the infamous and failed “Baker Plan” for international debt-service maintenance. Boy Gray also retaliated against Baker by questioning the constitutionality of a deal negotiated by Baker with the Congress for aid to the Nicaraguan contras, a deal which Newsweek classified as “Bush’s only foreign-policy success” during his first two months in office. [fn 7] Bush had attempted to burnish his image by promising that his new regime would break with the sleazy Reagan years by promoting new high standards of ethical behavior in which even the perception of corruption and conflict of interest would be avoided. These hollow pledges were promptly deflated by the reality of more graft and more hypocrisy than under Reagan.

      </p>
      <p>
       I don't see my point there. As I recall, and this goes way back, George Bush nominated six current Nazis to his cabinet. When the scandal broke, he withdrew the nominations. I don't see how Tarpley could miss it. :(

       Never once heard of him being a nazi, it's kind of comical you say that. I'm starting to noice a trend in this sub, any mention of a republican president or presidential candidate, words like nazi and war criminal get thrown around. Guess it's okay that former president Clinton just continued the same practices you dub Bush a nazi for. And Clinton did it for 8 years. I'm just tired of every post or comment pushing some agenda even here in this sub...

       You really ought to read up on the Bush family's connections. Say what you will about Clinton and his own criminal legacy (lord knows no one else here was talking about him), his family's fortune didn't come from Auschwitz.

          I do not claim ownership for this film.  This film goes in detail through the untold history of The Project for the New American Century with tons of archival footage and connects it right into the present. This film exposes how every major war in US history was based on a complete fraud with video of insiders themselves admitting it. This film shows how the first film theaters in the US were used over a hundred years ago to broadcast propaganda to rile the American people into the Spanish-American War. This film shows the white papers of the oil company Unocal which called for the creation of a pipeline through Afghanistan and how their exact needs were fulfilled through the US invasion of Afghanistan. This film shows how Halliburton under their "cost plus" exclusive contract with the US Government went on a mad dash spending spree akin to something out of the movie Brewster's Millions, yet instead of blowing $30 million they blew through BILLIONS by literally burning millions of dollars worth of hundred thousand dollar cars and trucks if they had so much as a flat tire. "A stunning film. It should be seen as widely as possible, in cinemas, bars, clubs, at meetings and, of course, through the internet. I'm sure the film will continue to be a source of debate and political education for many years. Maybe until the war criminals have been brought to trial." - Ken Loach While Massimo Mazzuccos first political documentary, GLOBAL DECEIT (2006), focused on the long list of inconsistencies in the official version of the 9/11 attacks, THE NEW AMERICAN CENTURY explores the historical, philosophical and economic background that suggests a matrix for such events that is much closer to home than the so-called "Islamic terrorism". The film provides solid evidence for the true reasons behind the Afghanistan and Iraq wars, whose unfolding is described in chilling detail in a document called "Project for the New American Century", published in the year 2,000, that seems to have served as the actual blueprint for such dramatic events  Support the Film-Makers:

       Exposed myself? That's funny. Clinton is fair game when talking about Bush Sr. as he was the following pres. Just like Regan would be fair game for discussion as well. The context of a presidents term in office is often dictated by the proceeding and previous presidents. 
 Just because he came from a political family doesn't make him inherently evil. And I can understand criticizing a presidents policy, but to criticize them as a person? To belittle their military service? That's just petty. The man became president (something no one on this sub could ever accomplish) and did his best with the country he was given at the time. But because he is a Republican you feel it is acceptable to berate his family? To call a man who served in WW2 a nazi?? That's sickening.

       You've come unhinged. If you can't engage the material I've provided, then we don't have much more to talk about. Your world outlook is dangerously impressionistic. Let's talk about all of the American presidents. That's fine with me. We can start with Kennedy and whether or not your beloved Poppy can honestly be placed in Dallas the day he was shot.

       Seriously, look at the stuff I've linked. It's not about berating servicemen or Republicans. There's an entire world of shit here, and you can't see it because you won't look. Someone's sold you a  bill of goods.

       I checked your links and dubbed them redundant. The people writing your "sources" all have an agenda to push, the one that lines up with your own apparently. I am not saying he didn't do some questionable shit. I'm saying the narrative you gulp down is presented to you by someone else, form your own opinions man don't rely on other people's work to validate yourself. Ima leave this alone now I've said my peace. The day the world opens its eyes and realizes sometimes shady shit is required to keep our nation safe will be a day worth celebrating. Much more worthy of celebration  than the death of an old man who looked after your freedom for 4 years. That is if you're even an American, how should I know.

       And your ignorance is sad. I formed my own opinions through a college education and a whole lot of research papers, with sources gathered from a legitimate database, you know peer reviewed sources? Not a google search. If you have a problem with this beautiful nation then please leave, there's other places to go. However, you probably can't draw welfare and feed your children with WIC there. I take great pride in my nationalism, thank you kindly.

       Eh, I'm a happy healthy American citizen with a great job and a stable income to support mine own. I live in a free country that elects leaders who keep me and my family safe from those who would mean us harm simply for what we have. Why you hate the country and her leaders whom have sheltered and protected you your entire life I will never understand. Move to Europe if you can't handle the nationalism. I hear things are pretty safe there lately... History is written by the victor.

       Nah you're just a weakling who enjoys talking shit about successful people on the internet because you know you'll never accomplish as much as any of the people you regularly bash. You make not one bit of difference complaining about the so called "wrong doings" of dead and past leaders. Let's talk about George Soros (if that's how you spell it) or the pedo-Podesta brothers? You know people who actually do wrong in the name of their own personal gain? Not the benefit of the American people like a president does.
Oh I'm sorry I forgot, people like Podesta are your people. All globalism, open border social justice kiddie fondlers right? So they do no wrong, while the men who make the hard decisions such as the defense of our nation from a terrorist threat or taking out the largest cocaine producer in world history (Pablo Escobar) are just evil men right?
Moral of the story is it's completely bad as that Bush senior sky dived at 91. Good for him he's living the life.

       Well there's no need to curse at me like a child, grow up already this is a debate. I'm just saying if these leaders weren't there, you'd probably would be bowing down to someone named Muhammad something or another. In this world unless you hold the power you pay homage and respect to those who do. And guess what? You elect whom you want to hold that power isn't that cool? The majority of the country picked this man out, just because you don't like him doesn't mean he's a nazi... 
   Now I admit there's been much better leaders than the Bush presidents. (Reagan being my personal favorite) but when these men were in office we were at war. Desert storm and then Iraq. Now you probably believe that the president is to blame for these wars right? Which is such an astoundingly ignorant statement it physically hurts. 
  There is so much more in play out there in this world than me or you will ever be aware of. You will never be able to google international wartime secrets no matter how convinced you are that you can. These men picked up the mantle and carried us through trying times, then then things got easier passed the torch to a democrat who could work on the social justice shit during peace time. (Pres. Bill Clinton. You know he reduced the national deficit to its lowest point in recent history right?) fact of the matter is these former presidents deserve your respect. By all means criticize their policy.
   But when you start taking shots at their family, at their character you stoop go low for me to ignore. This whole post is just about someone upset that Bush sr. is still alive and mad the front page. Just open your eyes to the messed up real world we live in and grow the fuck up.

       I simply don't believe they participated in nazi things. And I don't think there was much profit flowing out of concentration camps, most certainly not enough to build a fortune. I have no doubt great granddaddy Bush probably threw some money around nazi Germany. So did every other global bank. Before America declared war it was just Germany under the control of a new political party. At the time we didn't realize how evil nazi Germany was. We held the Olympics in Berlin 1936 right? Hitler organized that did he not? So anyone who went there or advertised there gave money to nazi Germany. 
It sounds so scary to say "Bush grandfather gave money to Nazis" but so did the American Olympic teams, civilians, and other politicians  who simply went to the Olympic Games or had simple business in Germany.
 I understand that narrowing the view to "Bush family nazi money" fits your liberal perspective nicely. But I do not believe for one second that the Bush in question knowingly funded the Nazi war machine or concentration camps. He just had business in Germany as many Americans at the time did. Now that his children and grandchildren are your favorite scapegoats (presidents of the United States) the "nazi connection" makes him sound so evil. But all one has to do is wade through the fragments of information this sub presents you with and preform your own research (like they teach you in college) to see that no, in fact no Bush was ever a nazi.

       The last thing any of us want on this sub is some bootlicker defending and downplaying nazis while advocating police state measures in the name of safety. A famous Franklin quote comes to mind, for the patriots among us.

       Hahahahahaha you called me a bootlicker. It's only absurd to you because you're used to the liberal echo chamber that this sub is. I thought I'd spice things up a little with a differing opinion and judging by your replies I succeeded. Everyone who's replied to me has made it oh so clear that they just want to hear how right they are.
 You can spin it how you want but I'm not advocating naziism in the least. I'm simply pointing out how 'absurd' it is that you seriously believe a Bush collaborated  with the Nazi agenda. 
I mean come on, could both a father and son be elected as president with a legit nazi connection? You just hate them because the msm did and a liberals favorite insult is 'nazi' or 'racist'.

       Prescott Bush made the Bush family as we know it today by financing the Nazis. His country was at war, and he got fat and secured his family's power and authority for generations to come by banking for the people who were killing his countrymen and slaughtering millions of innocents.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bush senior orchestrated the assassination of the last non-fascist president.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bush junior is responsible for the worst false flag in American history, killing thousands of innocent citizens and using the whole mess as a contact trived excuse to invade countries who had things he wanted.
      </p>

       In case you're wondering how that last one is related to nazis, please Google the Reichstag fire.

       His family was tied to the Nazi party, but you are still right in the belief that a narrative is being pushed.   Lots of people at that time were connected to the Nazi party and lots were business men and well connected people.  Such as Henry Ford and Koch brothers.  That's how Germany got good at war.  Ford helped with the manufacture of war machines and Koch with refineries to fuel them.   These 2 are just examples, I am sure the list is huge.  But also at the time Nazi's weren't the evil bastards that they came to be.  I feel sure it could be argued that they felt the nazi or fascist party was a new patriotic government that was trying to get their country out of a depression and on track to being successful again (and they probably would make some serious coin doing it too.)  You also have to remember that pre ww2 there were fascist and communist groups here in the states.  I'm not talking about a few nuts that got together but serious groups sponsoring politicians to get elected into office.  It wasn't the 2 party system we have now.  But with all the bad that fascism turned into and of course those damn commies that were after us, no one wanted to stay on those trains anymore cause you would get blacklisted or worse.  McCarthy saw to that and the government's fear mongering game was strong.  So most people tried to hide the fact they had anything to do with these groups.  So it is a part of history but not necessarily a conspiracy.  But hey, I'm no expert, I just really enjoy history and conspiracies.

       To bad he will probably outlive your unhappy ass. Be happy you live in a country where you can sleep soundly every night and don't have to worry about you or your families physical safety every day. 
That safety we all enjoy, this ability to argue over the Internet. It is only possible because of strong leaders such as the Bush family. If they weren't there you would probably be dead, enslaved, or praying to Mecca right now so to each his own.

       There's plenty of links to videos and articles in this thread to make my points. Drug dealing, high treason, war crimes, torture, paedophilia, occult practices,  one world government, etc. This list goes on. Your blatant disregard to any Conspiracy involving your beloved Bush family is ridiculous. Are they involved in every little Conspiracy mentioned above? Probably not, but I'm certain that if all was revealed and everything made public, their legacy would be more in line with the Conspiracy theories than with what the MSM fluff pieces tell you. That, I'm certain of.

       Yeah, and every other politician ever. Just accept your bitching about it online won't do anything. These people laugh at your petty existence. Just accept we are better off than the rest of the world (being Americans) and the political corruption is just a part of the American experience. I guarantee you have never been directly affected by any of this corruption you complain about. Call out things like the Serbian genocide, or the president of Russia that's been president  for what like 20 plus years? Don't talk shit about an American president who did what he could with an inherently corrupt system. I'm done now. Peace out libtards!

       The story clearly states, "he lived aboard that submarine for a month, assisting in the rescue of other aviators." As though this was some act of altruism.

       I lived aboard a DDG for a few weeks when our carrier pulled out early because of a typhoon and about a hundred of us had to hitch a ride. We had to do work. No one received or ecpected any atta-boys for doing a little work.

       This is clearly a autobiographical puff piece to make a "hero" out of a guy who bailed on his crew.

       It's choosing to highlight one slice of his life, and the fact that it got such a rediculous amount of upvotes is telling. I guarantee that if someone put a TIL about something nice Hitler did, it would not see above 10 points.

       He enforced the first public Smoking Smoking Awareness campaign, ran state funded schools (I think all the way through post secondary), he was very spiritual, I'm sure there are lots more you could cherry pick to make him seem like a fair-minded leader interested in progressing his nation and the citizens therein.

       These NWO freaks seem to live forever man. Rockefeller was 101, Bush is still alive at 92, Soros and Rothschild both seem to be in decent health. This kinda thing makes me wonder if there really is a cure for cancer that's being withheld from the public and reserved for the elite.

       Only the ones paying attention.  The Bush family have for generations been members of a British secret society run by foreign spooks and narcotraffickers.  Every time one of them gets into public service all hell breaks loose but somehow they're never held accountable.  But they will be.

       Mainly because that can't be proven. He was never arrested, no charges, historically, he ISN'T a war criminal. You know, since the victors write the history books.
      </p>
      <p>
       A TIL that mentions he is a coward who bailed on all his crewmates and left them to die is verifiable. That he tried to pack his cabinet with actual Nazis is verifiable. You might even get away with something akin to "TIL there are documents released from the FBI that seem to indicate the George HW Bush may have been instrumental in the assassination of JFK"

       I highly recommend Roger Stone's Book,
       <em>
        The Bush Crime Family
       </em>
       , if you haven't read it yet. All kinds of info going back to Samuel and Prescott Bush's war profiteering to Jeb and George W's involvement with the cartel in the '80s. And I'm only a quarter of the way into it.
      </p>
      <p>
       George Sr.'s oil business was a front for CIA operations in Central America and the Caribbean in the 1950's and 1960's. He may have been a CIA agent himself starting around 1961, or even as early as 1954, though he denies being one before 1975. There are a couple of government documents mentioning "CIA Agent George Bush" going back to 1961. The CIA claims those documents are referring to George William Bush, who was a clerk and claims to have never received the briefing that "CIA Agent George Bush" was given by the FBI regarding the reaction of Cuban Americans to Kennedy's assassination on November 29, 1963.
      </p>
      <p>
       George Bush has a long history of claiming not to remember where he was when Kennedy was assassinated. He was in Dallas on November 21st, 1963, but not on the 22nd. On November 22nd, six minutes after Kennedy was announced to be dead, he placed a phone call to the FBI from Tyler, Texas, accusing a Houston GOP rival of possibly being the assassin (creating an Alibi for himself? or  trying to get revenge?). He had been meeting with known CIA spies and big oilmen who hated Kennedy's politics in the weeks leading up to the assassination. He may have been at a party with said big oilmen, CIA agents, Jack Ruby,  and none other than Vice President Lyndon Johnson on the night of the 21st before departing for Tyler, TX. He also was in contact with George de Mohrenschidt, a Russian immigrant who had been asked by the CIA to befriend Oswald and gather information about him in spring of 1963, and he was a longtime friend of ex-CIA director Dulles, who had been fired by Kennedy after the Bay of Pigs (or possibly after Kennedy found out the CIA was planning to carry out terror attacks on US soil to start a war with Cuba).

       My guess? He still has a grudge against Jeb and George H.W. after working on opposing Republican Presidential campaigns (Trump and Reagan). That or he's just woke now and he realized what terrible people they are. He does say in the book that he supported Bush for Senate in the 1964 and 70 elections, but after meeting him in person he opposed Reagan's choice to pick him as Vice President.

       I was inferring the conspiracy is that posts like that manipulate people's opinions or perceptions of a truly horrendous individual by highlighting a positive element of his story.

       I saw you countered by saying that one could try to do the same about Hitler,  but I seriously doubt it. I think you're being a bit naive there. And if you believe it, please do so your self and pm the link to the post. Obviously if it hits the front page I will accept you were right.

       Okay I can see that. I think its more of a defense mechanism to make things and people not seem as bad, especially when that person is not leaving the light.

       Growing up you are told presidents are amazing people. Then you grow up and become informed, now you see them as scum, but in your brain some semblance of you wants them to still be a hero, so little pieces of trivia about a person that has no connection to what the person did seem more comfortable. It gives you insight to the real person and not the person who was in front of the camera or running the country.

       He led Operation 40 and supervised killing JFK, he facilitated removing Nixon, he attempted to have Reagan assassinated in coup #3 but took over anyhow, he smuggled drugs with Clinton during Iran-Contra.  Over his career he lost elections over and over and over again, but the Rockefellers and his father placed him in positions of great power.  His father attempted to buy Smedley Butler to create war for profit, when that failed they moved on to a performer known as Adolf Hitler and gave him $32,000,000.

       That's not true at all... we know who ACs children are. None of them are Bushs'. there was a rumor that he was Barbara bush's uncle, but that was debunked. Crowley never left the UK.

       I was there and I did not know who he was. I recall hearing the term "Manufacturing Consent," but not who popularized it. So no, I don't TRUST YOU. :)

       I watched television and Noam Chomsky was not on it and not mentioned on it at any significant level. You know who I remember seeing on TV all the time -- and on "liberal" PBS for that matter? Mr. William Buckley.

       Only the ones paying attention.  The Bush family have for generations been members of a British secret society run by foreign spooks and narcotraffickers.  Every time one of them gets into public service all hell breaks loose but somehow they're never held accountable.  But they will be.

       Yeah, and every other politician ever. Just accept your bitching about it online won't do anything. These people laugh at your petty existence. Just accept we are better off than the rest of the world (being Americans) and the political corruption is just a part of the American experience. I guarantee you have never been directly affected by any of this corruption you complain about. Call out things like the Serbian genocide, or the president of Russia that's been president  for what like 20 plus years? Don't talk shit about an American president who did what he could with an inherently corrupt system. I'm done now. Peace out libtards!
