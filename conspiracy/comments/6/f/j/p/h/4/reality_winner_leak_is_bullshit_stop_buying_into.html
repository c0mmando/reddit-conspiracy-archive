Suddenly when its Reality Winner instead of Seth Rich, arguments like &quot;she couldn&#39;t have had access to the documents&quot;, &quot;shes too low ranking&quot;, &quot;her social media shows shes biased, so it&#39;s fake&quot; etc are somehow upvoted.</p>

<p>What I find funny about this is that there was a massive push for &quot;Seth Rich was actually a Bernie supporter and leaked as revenge because he hates Hillary&quot; not even a month ago. But all of a sudden it&#39;s terrible to leak something just because you hate someone. Also the &quot;how would they even be able to access the documents that were leaked&quot; argument is completely disregarded when you ask the same thing about Rich.
