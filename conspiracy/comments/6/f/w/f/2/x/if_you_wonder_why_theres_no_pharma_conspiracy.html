<p>Condé Nast today announced the launch of a marketing solutions division focusing on health and wellness, Condé Nast Pharma.  Condé Nast Pharma will combine the industry-leading audience targeting capabilities of Condé Nast Spire, the company’s proprietary data optimization platform, with a significant expansion of health and wellness editorial content created across the company’s portfolio of iconic brands, all designed to optimize and drive sales for <strong>advertising partners</strong>.</p>

<p>It&#39;s spooky when you consider what Conde Nast spire actually is.</p>

<p>It&#39;s like the various subreddits people subscribe to are just ways to classify people into quantifiable units, used to sell data to advertisers. They make profiles on us based on our chosen subs, and key words in our comments, and that data defines you into a profile that&#39;s sold to advertisers.</p>

<p>Maybe this seems harmless, and I guess it&#39;s cool that we can come on here for free. I think it&#39;s pretty cool that we&#39;re allowed to express our different points of view. And there&#39;s lots of lessons to be learned from the unfiltered human expression that goes on here. I guess there&#39;s always a price to pay. In our case we have to deal with obvious sock puppeting to access our beloved content.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Let me throw this out there on things:</p>

<p>The media. Local stations and papers (I follow every TV station in the US, will add papers to that soon, on twitter).</p>

<p>Big Pharma buys ads on those stations (and papers, and radio). basically they hand them money. You think they will bite the hand that pays them?</p>

<p>Congress (mainly republican now) wants to allow more media consolidation which means less independent stations and more big ones that can be bought off easily across the country (making a thread about that shortly actually).</p>

<p>What we need is more restrictions on companies being able to buy up media, not less. Otherwise we will get less real coverage and less reporters who can investigate things and report on them.</p>

We really need to raise awareness so people can actually start getting better and not just masking symptoms and stop ending up with more disease.

<p>Yahoo, engadget, bloomberg, nyt, guardian, telegraph... Looks about 50/50 on the front page. </p>

<p>I&#39;m against giving views to people profiting off of this sub and its peers. I avoid YouTubers unless it&#39;s a live happening. A hearing, protest, terrorist attack, etc. I&#39;m strongly for archiving all news links whether they&#39;re tiny or not. If someone likes the provider and wants to support them by viewing ads that&#39;s their decision. It&#39;s another issue when people start trying to profit off of their blogs (pg guy selling swag.) News is in a sad state. Controversy, click bait, and bullshit generates views when there&#39;s not enough news. Outlets are incentized to increase viewership by whatever means their management and or users will tolerate. I get these people are trying to make a living, they should understand there are many who are sick of the tactics being used. I&#39;m sure many don&#39;t, this is an unfortunate case of a few bad apples spoiling them all. This is obviously just my opinion. I was merely pointing out the irony not trying to down a peg here man...</p>
