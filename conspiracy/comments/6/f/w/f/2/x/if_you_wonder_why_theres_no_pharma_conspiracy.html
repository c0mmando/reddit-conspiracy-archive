       It's like the various subreddits people subscribe to are just ways to classify people into quantifiable units, used to sell data to advertisers. They make profiles on us based on our chosen subs, and key words in our comments, and that data defines you into a profile that's sold to advertisers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe this seems harmless, and I guess it's cool that we can come on here for free. I think it's pretty cool that we're allowed to express our different points of view. And there's lots of lessons to be learned from the unfiltered human expression that goes on here. I guess there's always a price to pay. In our case we have to deal with obvious sock puppeting to access our beloved content.

       So we get to see more tv ads telling us to "ask your doctor is Titclydula is right for you!"

       And then, a year later, we get to see more lawyer ads asking "did you, or someone you love, take Titclydula for the common cold?"

       Let me throw this out there on things:
      </p>
      <p>
       The media. Local stations and papers (I follow every TV station in the US, will add papers to that soon, on twitter).
      </p>
      <p>
       Big Pharma buys ads on those stations (and papers, and radio). basically they hand them money. You think they will bite the hand that pays them?
      </p>
      <p>
       Congress (mainly republican now) wants to allow more media consolidation which means less independent stations and more big ones that can be bought off easily across the country (making a thread about that shortly actually).
      </p>
      <p>
       What we need is more restrictions on companies being able to buy up media, not less. Otherwise we will get less real coverage and less reporters who can investigate things and report on them.

       Big Pharma Conspiracy is very real, and terribly grotesque. We really need to raise awareness so people can actually start getting better and not just masking symptoms and stop ending up with more disease. This conspiracy is one the people can actually easily tackle if we were able to raise awareness.

       A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.  However, many of the links are from nonprofits and a lot of the youtube content is just from individual's channels.  Perhaps you can help me source non corporate new?  Would love to hear your suggestions.

       Yahoo, engadget, bloomberg, nyt, guardian, telegraph... Looks about 50/50 on the front page.

       I'm against giving views to people profiting off of this sub and its peers. I avoid YouTubers unless it's a live happening. A hearing, protest, terrorist attack, etc. I'm strongly for archiving all news links whether they're tiny or not. If someone likes the provider and wants to support them by viewing ads that's their decision. It's another issue when people start trying to profit off of their blogs (pg guy selling swag.) News is in a sad state. Controversy, click bait, and bullshit generates views when there's not enough news. Outlets are incentized to increase viewership by whatever means their management and or users will tolerate. I get these people are trying to make a living, they should understand there are many who are sick of the tactics being used. I'm sure many don't, this is an unfortunate case of a few bad apples spoiling them all. This is obviously just my opinion. I was merely pointing out the irony not trying to down a peg here man...
