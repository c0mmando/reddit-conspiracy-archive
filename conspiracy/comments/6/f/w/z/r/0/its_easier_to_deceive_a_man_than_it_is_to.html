<p>Definitely. Doesn&#39;t mean its total bullshit though. I used to think that but the more and more I learn, the more and more I&#39;m convinced there is something to it. I&#39;m pretty certain &quot;God(s)&quot; is/are real. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for your reply. I too was raised Christian up until a teenager, I too walked away from the faith, and turned my back on it all. I didn&#39;t understand it. Back then I would call myself agnostic. Never truly dis-believing in &#39;God&#39;, I was never able to subscribe to the &#39;random chance&#39; theory of design/creation that is pushed today. Everything was clearly designed, it was put together to perfectly to be anything less than designed. But who was the designer? Which &#39;religion&#39; is correct? I had many questions, hard questions, and very few people had any good answers to offer me. Eventually, I had formed a perverted view of what the Bible is, what Christianity is (or rather, should be) and who God/Jesus is. It wasn&#39;t until the trials and tribulations of this life beat me down to the point where I was willing to listen, learn and ultimately, submit that things started to change.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know how many people will say this, but the Bible is not intended to be a system of religion or rules you have to follow. Those are made by men. The Bible is intended to lead you into a personal <strong>relationship</strong> with the One, True, Living God (specifically Jesus Christ),  NOT a religion! Religions are man-made and are indeed systems of control, however there is incredible <strong>freedom</strong> found in Jesus (who IS God, not just a man!!!)</p>

<p>I&#39;ll try to address your 2 points:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Do this and this, but don&#39;t do this, and then maybe you&#39;ll get to heaven
This understanding is an incorrect fallacy that has been mis-understood and pushed by those whom do not have the wisdom or understanding of God and his Word. The belief that you can &quot;earn&quot; your way to heaven through acts here on earth is, simply put, a very dangerous lie. Many other religions incorporate &quot;good works&quot; into their false doctrines in hopes that you can &quot;earn&quot; your way to heaven. We are not intended to be chained or burden with this guilt of never knowing if we are &quot;good enough&quot; to get into heaven. The answer is No, no you are not &quot;good enough&quot;. Neither am I, or <strong>anyone else</strong> that has ever lived on this earth, with one huge exception. ONLY the sinless life of Gods&#39; Son (Jesus) pays the legal price to atone for our sins of the flesh and mind. There is NO other way to The Father, except Through Him.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Do not expect to change yourself to be &quot;good&quot; in God&#39;s eyes first. Rather, put your faith in Him, and He will change You to be more Christ-like! Knowing we will never be perfect in this life, we are all sinners, all condemned, all sentenced, but those that love God will try and show this through our acts of kindness and love towards others.</p>

<p>&quot;For Moses writes about the righteousness that is based on the law, that the person who does the commandments shall live by them. But the righteousness based on faith says, “Do not say in your heart, ‘Who will ascend into heaven?’” (that is, to bring Christ down) “or ‘Who will descend into the abyss?’” (that is, to bring Christ up from the dead). But what does it say? “The word is near you, in your mouth and in your heart” (that is, the word of faith that we proclaim); because, <strong>if you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. For with the heart one believes and is justified, and with the mouth one confesses and is saved</strong>. For the Scripture says, “Everyone who believes in him will not be put to shame.” For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek; for the same Lord is Lord of all, bestowing his riches on all who call on him. For “everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved.” ** - Romans 10:5-13**</p>

<p>“For God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that <strong>whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life</strong>. For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but in order that the world might be saved through him. <strong>Whoever believes in him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe is condemned already, because he has not believed in the name of the only Son of God</strong>. And this is the judgment: the light has come into the world, and people loved the darkness rather than the light because their works were evil. For everyone who does wicked things hates the light and does not come to the light, lest his works should be exposed&quot; ** - John 3:16-20**</p>

<p>There are only <strong>TWO</strong> commandments given by Jesus to follow. If we can do these, then we will not break any other commandments given:</p>

<p>&quot;And one of them, a lawyer, asked him a question to test him. “Teacher, which is the great commandment in the Law?” And he said to him, “<strong>You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind</strong>. This is the great and first commandment. And a second is like it: <strong>You shall love your neighbor as yourself</strong>. On these two commandments depend all the Law and the Prophets.” ** - Matthew 22:35-40**</p>

<p>1) Love God FIRST!</p>

<p>2) Love everyone else!</p>

<p>For you cannot murder, rape, steal from, or lie to someone else if you are treating them with Love. It&#39;s impossible. Granted, easy to say, hard to do.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And Catholicism is an even bigger joke. I mean purgatory? &quot;If you buy these indulgences then your loved ones will pass through purgatory quicker.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I actually agree with you. Roman Catholicism that exists today is an absolute joke, and completely rotted from the inside. I&#39;m honestly not sure if it was ever a true Biblical institution. I&#39;m not saying that there are not true followers of Christ amongst its ranks, indeed there are. But there are many that are not, and pretend to be but are actually in league with Satan. True Biblical Christianity and Roman Catholicism are not the same. There is so much to write on this specific subject..</p>

<p>In closing, we need to actually pick up the Bible and read it for ourselves. If you have never done so, I suggest starting in the gospel of John. Pray for a spirit of discernment, for wisdom, for knowledge and for truth. He <strong>will</strong> answer, if you are willing to listen. &quot;Seek and ye shall find.&quot; There is incredible meanings to these words.</p>

<p>This doesn&#39;t take away from the fact that God gave both us, and spirits (angels) <strong>FREE WILL</strong> to willingly choose our destiny.

    <div class="md"><p>Right... it&#39;s my closed mind that has allowed me to gain insight that biblical prophecy fulfillment occurs in September of this very year, and that there is a literal sign in the heavens above us that has been forming for the last 6 months that no one (unless you are a believer and followed in Jesus Christ and therefore the Word of God that taught us this) out of the 7+ billion people in this world are even aware of. It&#39;s tired directly to Israel being formed almost 70 years ago. I know everything is about to change. Everything, and sooner than you can possibly imagine. I know the truth, and I reject everything else that are lies and deceit from pagan religions. If that is considered &#39;closed minded&#39; by todays pathetic standards, than I&#39;m happy to have that label.</p>

<p><em>Whoever trusts in his own mind is a fool,
    but he who walks in wisdom will be delivered.</em>
<strong>Proverbs 28:26</strong></p>

<p><em>18 Let no one deceive himself. If anyone among you thinks that he is wise in this age, let him become a fool that he may become wise. 19 For the wisdom of this world is folly with God. For it is written, “He catches the wise in their craftiness,” 20 and again, “The Lord knows the thoughts of the wise, that they are futile.”</em>

    <div class="md"><p>So you&#39;re saying that God is so powerful (which He is) that he can&#39;t control his own power? That wouldn&#39;t be a very sovereign or omnipotent God if that was the case.</p>

<p>I partially agree with you in the sense that if God were to reveal Himself truly to us, His Light would utterly destroy/erradicate us due to the sin that is lives within us all, this is true. That&#39;s why he has created a Veil between us, to protect us. This is why the spiritual realm is hidden from most people&#39;s eyes, again, for our protection. If people really understood the negative entities (spirits) that are temporarily allowed to persist in the spiritual realm and relentless torment us, most peoples minds would shatter, they are too weak and fearful to comprehend such things.</p>

<p>For what it&#39;s worth, here&#39;s something I wrote awhile back on this subject:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We know that UV light kills all bacteria, right? Have you ever thought of God&#39;s &quot;light&quot; of having that same effect on the sin that is in each and every one of us? Perhaps He protects us by having a veil between us and Him for if He were to present Himself to us, bathed in His Glory, we would all be immediately eradicated and destroyed because of the sin(darkness) within all of us. Since all (100%) of us have been born into sin, the darkness resides inside us, woven into our very existence, probably into our very own genetic structure on this planet. The very exposure to God/Christ in His true form would completely destroy us as sinners in our fleshly mortal form.</p>

<p>God is perfect. God is love. God is light. He has NO darkness or sin whatsoever in Him. He is completely pure. Not even the smallest amount of sin can be allowed to enter Him (nor can He be tempted by it). No evil comes from Him. He cannot be corrupted by it like we have been. Thus why we must be &quot;reborn&quot; from this earth and reborn from the spirit in Him. Our earthly, physical, fleshly bodies must remain here. The wages of sin, even in the most minute form is made known to us. The wages of sin is Death. Period. No exceptions. Since we have been born into sin, we were doomed to die before we were even born.</p>

<p>The only way the uniqueness and individuality that makes us who we are can be saved is through the free gift of Salvation through Jesus Christ that was given to us by God&#39;s grace. A free gift of grace that CANNOT be earned through good works on this earth. Only the acceptance of the FREE GIFT that grants us eternal salvation that is freely and openly available to anyone, anywhere, at anytime, guarantees us a spiritual re-birthing that is free from sin into a heavenly body that Our Lord has prepared for each of us. The flesh must remain here. It is doomed to die and perish in the fires of this world at the end of the age. These mortal bodies were formed from dust, and will return to dust. Our eternal soul can be saved by His grace and our acknowledgement and acceptance of Jesus Christ&#39;s death and resurrection, recognizing Jesus as the Son of God, whom paid for our sins by being the last, and most perfect blood sacrifice on the Cross. We as believers in Christ will be reborn anew from within, baptized in the Holy Spirit. We will become Children of God, grafted into His family through the blood and sacrifice that was given to us by the mercy, love and grace from God to us all as a free gift. A gift that we must choose to take of our own free will. You must <strong>choose.</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why must &quot;God&quot; be sovereign and omnipotent?</p>

<p>To something the size of an electron or smaller, a human would be considered &quot;God&quot;.</p>

<p>Humans are not in control of individual particles in their body, so why couldn&#39;t this relative scale be applied to humans and their &quot;God (s)&quot;?</p>

<p>You assume &quot;God&quot; cares about humanity and life on Earth, but it&#39;s entirely possible &quot;God&quot; is oblivious.  In fact, it&#39;s probably much more feasable, considering what we observe in the universe.</p>

<p>Biblical apocalyptic prophecy</p>

<p>I was looking into this last night for the first time, and I&#39;m not quite convinced yet. When the guy on YT was going through the passages about end times, seems like it could have been misinterpreted. I&#39;d like to hear your thoughts on it though. Is there a specific date? I saw September 23rd, 2017 because of the astrology angle. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just need to make a post about it. There&#39;s way too many synchronicities to explain in a mobike reply.</p>

<p>The 23rd of Sept is simply the date of the Revelation 12 sign. There&#39;s much more to it than just that. You also don&#39;t need Enoch to understand it, theres an incredible amount of detail given in canon Bible.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s because we&#39;re not dealing with mere humans with some advanced astronomy knowledge, we&#39;re getting all of this info from the Bible, the written Word of God. It&#39;s not mere men that wrote it, it was divinely inspired by God, given to men, through men, for men. The book of Revelation was specifically given to the apostle John (the only one sparred a martys death) while in exile (for this faith) on the isle of Patmos. It is known as the &quot;Revelation of Jesus Christ&quot;. It is fittingly the last book, that wraps up over 3,500 years of prophecy given to us through 40 different authors over 1,500 years, directly from GOD Himself and is a perfect bookend to the Bible, and the age of humanity. It was HIM who set and determines the motions of the stars, wandering stars (planets), the sun and the moon. He is not bound by time, and knew exactly when and where this alignment would occur, since he created it. It is a one-time event. Everything is about to change.</p>

<p>This isn&#39;t touching the diving numerology associated with it either which further reinforces it as a divine sign or all the other signs of the times that go along with this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Bible has a surprisingly detailed road map laid out of what is going to transpire during the coming 7 year tribulation.</p>

<p>The thing is it&#39;s not about how worthy <em>we</em> are, for the truth is none of us are. It&#39;s all about how worthy <em>He</em> (Jesus) is, and what He did for us, and what it meant to truly settle the debt of sin that we have all accrued and stood guilty before God Almighty in judgement of in His divine legal system. </p>

<p>The wages of sin are death, something must die, this is inescapable. In the old Hebrew days it was innocent animals that paid the price and had their blood shed to atone for the peoples sins. The final innocent perfect sinless life lived by the Lamb that was slain, Jesus, was the final atoning offering to cover ALL sins of the entire world of each and every person. </p>

<p>You can choose to accept this free gift of salvation through faith in the Lord Jesus and His resurrection, or we can pay the price with our lives and be separated from God for all eternity. (ie - not saved, but rather &#39;deleted&#39;)</p>

<p>That&#39;s the thing about free will, it gives you a choice you have to make, of which you have a chance to choose poorly. <em>Choose wisely</em>, while there is still time, before the wrath begins.</p>

<p>/end preaching</p>

<p><em>&quot;If you declare with your mouth, “Jesus is Lord,” and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved&quot;</em> <strong>- Romans 10:9</strong></p>
