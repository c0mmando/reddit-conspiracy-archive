       Was watching a YouTube video the other day, and the video I was watching pointed out that the sun is no longer yellow when you look at it.
      </p>
      <p>
       When I was a kid, I recall it being a vivid yellow with hints of orange. However when I look at the sun now it's nearly white all the time. Sunsets are also different colors then what I recall as a kid, there's a lot more pinks, purples, and brighter shades. Sunsets don't seem to have as much red, or orange as they use to.
      </p>
      <p>
       Granted this could all be subjective, based on my location, and my memories might not be accurate but at the same time it appears as if something has changed with the color and brightness of our sun in at least the 30 years I've been on the planet.
      </p>

       Anyone else notice anything similar?

       Our brain is like a battery and the Sun is the best thing to charge it. I am in no way advocating it for anyone. But, it does work for me. It's peaceful. Becoming one with the awakening of Earth and to be there when the Sun goes to sleep, before all the darkness of the world comes. Brings me closer to the source things personally. The house I purchased was purchased with the sunrise and sunset in mind.

       I agree it sounds nice, my eyes are already bad, can't see super far but can see a reasonable distance before stuff gets blurry.
      </p>

       So I probably won't take on the practice, but i'll at least take a look and see what it's all about.

         you can train your eyes to deal with more sunlight than normal, however your eyes are sensitive things and you can easily literally BURN and SCAR the insides of your eyes from overexposure to sunlight.

         The early morning sun and later evening sun are easier for the human eye to look at because(supposedly) the atmospheric layer is so dense at the lower end of the sky that it blocks/mask the sun's light/uv/radiation.

       No. Please use sunglasses or other protective eyewear if planning to look at the sun for extended periods. A quick glance shouldn't do much damage though.

       Wonder if that ties into this theory I saw here the other day about the sun being more intense/people getting sunburnt easier this year. Unsubstantiated and anecdotal, but I wonder if some serious damage has been done to the atmosphere that they aren't telling us about that's exposing us to more UV. Ozone hole or something. I know they used to discuss holes in the Ozone layer all the time on the news, I don't recall hearing anything about it recently.

       Southern summer 2015 was the first recording of UV-C on the planets surface. Thinning ozone has allowed this potentially deadly radiation to hit the earth. Plants and animals are not designed to deal with UV-C... well maybe tardigrades

       Maybe thats why it looked yellow/orange when he was younger.(I feel the same about the sun as OP does) Now it looks whiter because over the years pollution from humanity has been depleting the atmosphere/ozone layer, etc. That seems logical to me

       When we switched from coal to grewnhouse globe reduced its particulate in the cloud layer yet its influenced a sort of sheen. Its more so acting as a lens now. Which makes the suns rays more intense.
      </p>
      <p>
       Our star also passes through helium fields which induce higher gamma activity.
      </p>
      <p>
       So the sun is infact the same. Yet additional helium isn't good. Nor is the escalation of contaminants which impact us as a  whole.

       Absoulty. Looks like the sun is about to rise in the western sky after sun set. The Inuit elders are bitching about how the sun is in the wrong part of the sky not because they remember some other reality where it rose in another part of the sky but because in this reality a thing in space time is actually affecting the tilt of the earth
Want to know what it is?

       hi
i don't actually know if there was a slight change in coloer of the sun (and i don't remember that from my childhood) but it seems to fit with a theory i have about life of stars. I'm sorry but there are some things that i must explain before dealing with the post subject:)
      </p>
      <p>
       _First: it's actually way more than life of just stars. For me, the expanding hollow planets, expand to a point where the crust being to far from the star core  falls down on the equatorial plane, making rings.
      </p>
      <p>
       _second: This happens while the core star of the planet, gathers so much hydrogen that it becomes coated with it and becomes a gas giant. Aether and its flow is the key to all this, as aether turns slowly into hydrogen (when "disturbed" by matter, while aether flowing through us is gravity, and aether waves are light).
      </p>
      <p>
       _3: The (invisible) aether spiral we're inside is made of aether flowing towards that central sun, making it accelerate slowly, and adding hydrogento its matter.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, the sun it growing, getting warmer, bigger, faster (that's what makes the solar system expansion happen as it is all an equilibrium between centripetal and centrifugal force).
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, and this is a very important part of the question, all this happens very fast (compared to the official millions and billions of years). Giants were actually found everywhere, showing that gravity was way lower not so long ago. Also go look at a hi res picture of the moon, check those ghost craters all around with no official explanation whatsoever...the moon is highly expanded. The pacific was once closed (it has complementary shapes on both sides of it) All these a just clues. Go check saturn's satellite iapetus, how it's crust is already falling into the equatorial plane, and Ceres with the holes in its crust showing the light inside...
      </p>

       watch it completely and keep an open mind because it's hard to fathom without context. Sun simulator patents and built versions exist.

       Hiding other planetary bodies passing through. Together with the spraying which causes this opaque sky the sun simulator's glare would over shine bodies as long as possible.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another reason would be providing light when a body causes a solar eclipse or the sun's light dimming due an electromagnetic flux connection with a brown dwarf or helium/iron oxide clouds passing by.
      </p>

       There's a stringent chain of logic behind it.

       It may be something to do with the atmosphere. As a kid I always remember sunny skies as being blue, an extremely strong blue. Now though there always seems to be a whiter tint or haze to the colour.

       I don't know. I think air quality in most major cities (in the us) actually has improved since the development of the EPA. In the 70s, things were really bad and there is photographic evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       But that's only a possibility. Honestly, who knows. I'm really glad you posted about this though. I too have seen some changes. The clouds that used to be in the sky every day where grew up are long gone now. And I am not the only one who has noticed the dramatic change.

       This is due to the presence of Planet X Nibiru in the inner solar system, which is a highly magnetic planet which is altering our magnetic and geophysical poles.  In additive colot theory, yellow light plus magenta light equals white light.  Brown dwarfs are magenta.  This is the true purpose of chemtrails and global dimming, an attempt by the wealthy elite to hide this passage so as to prevent panic in the public.  Their silly jet sprays target population centres especially at sunrise and sunset.  With the right filters at this time, you can see it.  They can't hide it forever!  Poleshift and global flood is coming, and the elites want to use this as an opportunity to dpopulate the planet by trapping people in coastal cities under martial law.

       Why hide this if it is actually happening?

       We've had alien movies shoved down our throats since we were kids at this point. The public would accept it.

       Not who you replied, but this Nibiru/Planet X stuff has nothing at all to do with aliens. I do think a lot of people would be okay with aliens, but this is a whole different beast.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't necessarily know that this is what's actually going on, but think of it like our scientists/elite knowing a civilization destroying asteroid is on its way and there is nothing they can do about it except try to shove as many important people as they can under mountains until it's over.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's the scenario some people think is happening. Aliens making themselves known is a far cry from billions of people realizing they are almost definitely going to die if they are told "Hey so.. theres a star/planet/solar system that's going to come way, way close to Earth and it's totally gonna fuck us up. We can't stop it and we don't have enough space to hide everyone in our sweet underground bunkers. So.. good luck!"
      </p>
      <p>
       So.. if it is true.. I 100% believe they'd hide anything cataclysmic like that from us for as long as humanly possible. They'd have to. If they didn't, they'd
       <em>
        never
       </em>
       make it to their bunkers safely. They'd get killed and their hiding places taken over so fast.

       That's if Planet X even exists, and if it comes close to earth doesn't even necessarily mean we're getting hit with a meteor. It might just create a pole shift or energetic shift. Which could still have a catastrophic effect.
      </p>
      <p>
       The theory is there's some kind of stargate or something on Planet X and that's all connected to aliens as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've obviously entertained this theory, still haven't accepted it yet though, but aside from some weird stuff going on with the sun, it's hard to say what's actually happening. I do agree with the possibility that the elite would hide something like this from the masses but the elite are also completely insane from satanic worshipping, as well as worshipping and practicing the three main religions.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's a lot religious dogma intertwined with Planet X theories so it's really hard to say.

       Well, yes. I was just using an asteroid impact scenario since that's probably more familiar.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe
       <em>
        any
       </em>
       sort of cataclysmic or extinction level event that our governments know is coming in advance would cause similar behavior. Us regular people would probably not find out about it until it was very close to happening and when all the important people are hidden away safely.
      </p>
      <p>
       So yeah, if this is actually a thing, I wouldn't necessarily think an impact would be what screws us. Although the massive extra gravity of a star or even a large planet could disturb asteroid belts, so who knows. From what I've gathered over the past year or two though, most people who think it's real expect most damage to be from a sudden pole shift and/or the extra gravity displacing massive amounts of water from our oceans.

       For me the bigger questions are when this is supposed to happen?
      </p>
      <p>
       Also some definitive proof of Planet X would help. I've seen some of the videos out there, but nothing that made me take them seriously. I think the theory itself is possible, but again just haven't seen enough evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       We don't know if chemtrails or any of these other supposed signs from the elite are even related to the Planet X theories.

       Very well said, I am one of those who think this is indeed our scenario.  We need to wake up the people.  This subject should be near the top of Reddit.  As for aliens, I've heard that Gen 3 or 4 Nightvision goggles can help you see their spacecraft.  So can eating a lot of dandelion greens and broadleaf plantains!

       Yeah, I've had a similar observation, on my own.  I can say this observation is untainted from being on r/conspiracy too long.  I observed, then started seeing posts.  The light schedule is off: rising earlier and setting later.  Also, the Sun appears more white-ish / silvery.  It's noticeable, to me.
      </p>
      <p>
       So far, I have only seen a few posts around here.
       <br/>
       Just today, I was anecdotally telling some folks about the artificial sun speculation.  Another man overheard and told me that he, too, 'independently observed some difference in the Sun.'
      </p>
      <p>
       Right now, I'm trying to find more info.  Someone has to have some "official report"?  Suggested locations?

       Talked to a long-time carpenter friend ... one who is obviously versed with a sun-up to sun-down life.  Also, asked him to check with his farmer friends.
      </p>
      <p>
       He says 'it's sorta year-by-year'.  He says he remembers times when he was younger and the Sun was harsher than usual, and years when it didn't seem all that bad.  He's just a regular dude, a good dude, an open-minded dude, so you need to take it as you may.  Our experiences are our own.
      </p>
      <p>
       He's about 45 y.o. and has been a carpenter since he was 17 y.o.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anecdotally, he's one of them dudes (white) that says you go outside at the start of the summer and just let yourself get burnt up once.  Then it don't really happen much after that.  But when he was working them long days, if you asked me, the man was sort of "maroon" at times.
      </p>
      <p>
       Personally, I use the highest SPF I can (50+), and I can still get burnt if I'm not careful!
