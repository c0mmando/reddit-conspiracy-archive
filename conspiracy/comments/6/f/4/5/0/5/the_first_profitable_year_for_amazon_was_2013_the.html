       To put that another way, Bezos used less than half the money he got from the CIA to buy the Washington Post.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you think that was a sweetheart deal?
      </p>
      <p>
       I do. And like others, I believe it’s something Americans should know about. For instance, the Washington Post often quotes unnamed CIA sources in its reporting. Yet, the Post doesn’t disclose that the CIA paid the owner of the paper more than twice what it cost to buy it. You won’t find any mention of this deal on the Washington Post’s Wikipedia page, either. Not worth mentioning, apparently.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now I want you to imagine the CIA contracting with WND.com for, say, a measly $600,000. How do you suppose that would be covered by the Washington Post? How would it be chronicled in Wikipedia? Do you think I’d get a pass? I think not.
      </p>
      <p>
       Who was CIA director when this deal with the Washington Post was finalized?
      </p>
      <p>
       John Brennan.
      </p>
      <p>
       You remember John Brennan? He’s the former CIA director, named by Barack Obama, who testified to Congress in March that Russia “brazenly interfered” in U.S. elections, including actively contacting members of Donald Trump’s campaign – but he stopped shy of dubbing it “collusion.”
      </p>
      <p>
       “I saw interaction that in my mind raised questions of whether it was collusion,” Brennan told Rep. Trey Gowdy, saying that he supported the FBI digging further. “It was necessary to pull threads.”
      </p>
      <p>
       It was Brennan, a good friend of Obama’s, who said he believed the contacts were numerous enough to alert the FBI, which began its probe into Trump associates that same July, according to previous congressional testimony from then-FBI Director James B. Comey. Brennan has been a loyal progressive Democrat since he voted for the Communist Party presidential candidate in 1976.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Washington Post has been on the Russian-Trump story like white on rice ever since – along with the New York Times, CNN, ABC News, CBS News, NBC News and the rest of the pack of jackals. This investigation has been going on since 2016, yet no evidence has been found to support the “collusion.”
      </p>
      <p>
       Wouldn’t you like to see an investigation into the collusion between John Brennan, Jeff Bezos, Amazon, the Washington Post and the CIA?
      </p>
      <p>
       I sure would.
      </p>
      <p>
       After all, they were all involved in an actual monetary deal that could have profound implications for the future of America, American business and American journalism.

       If anyone doubts the Amazon-CIA connection, just take a look at how many people are employed on Alexa. Amazon has more people working on Alexa than AWS, even though the latter is a much larger share of their revenue.
      </p>
      <p>
       It makes you wonder,
       <em>
        why are they pouring so much money into the Alexa project?

       Just to play Devil's Advocate, this could also be because database/server hosting (AWS) is a pretty solid industry that has been around for years and doesn't require a ton of manpower to manage. Whereas Alexa and AI/personal assistant stuff is still somewhat new it makes sense they would be devoting a lot more manpower to this department.
      </p>

       That being said, the CIA connection and the thing in March are very concerning.

       Based on what I've seen in telecom, I think that there's been mass surveillance for quite a while. But the KEY to all the mass surveillance is that it's always been done by third parties.
      </p>
      <p>
       For instance, fifteen years ago there was a case where a foreign software company was accused of spying :
       <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/story/2005/06/01/israeli-companies-spying-on-us-tech-firms.html">
        http://www.foxnews.com/story/2005/06/01/israeli-companies-spying-on-us-tech-firms.html
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       If you put the pieces together, you can see that Amazon has a lot of valuable data there. So it's not the NSA or the CIA spying on people directly; everything is done by third parties, so the agencies have plausible deniability that they didn't violate anyone's constitutional rights. The end result is the same, it's still spying, but it's a way of doing it that no one goes to prison.

       Well, voice platforms are being hyped as the next big userinterface so it's actually pretty smart business investment to focus on that but it obviously has benefits, just like almost any other new technology that gives them more "data" to monitor.

       Bezos is definitely in bed with the CIA, but Amazon deliberately took losses as a financial strategy to avoid paying taxes.  Many startup companies use similar accounting shenanigans.

       Yeah, to think that they didn't actually have profits is laughable. It was well known that Bezos was keeping actual profits and the growth of AWS close to his chest because he didn't want to tip off Amazon's rivals. They were also heavily investing in the Fire phone and other things that they could count as a capital expenditure and hence post a net loss.
      </p>
      <p>
       To think that they only got profits because of a paltry $600m contract from the CIA is naive.

       You have no idea how businesses work, there are a score of Fortune 500 companies that declared losses over $1 *
       <em>
        billion
       </em>
       last year. And with tech companies it's normal to have losses as they aggressively grow and reinvest.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can have some fun with the CIA stuff too.
      </p>
      <p>
       Jeff Bezos is the second richest man in the world. Amazon Web Services getting a $600m contract with the CIA (that's revenue over ten years) is nothing to him, hell it's nothing to AWS, and it's not like he even owns all of Amazon, he has 16.9%.
      </p>
      <p>
       But let's play your game and pretend that the CIA gave Amazon $600m upfront, they didn't actually have to provide any service over the course of a decade. Bezos share is a cool $101.4m.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course it's nothing like that in reality because that's his share of the company, but we're playing OPs game. So let's instead say the CIA gave him $101.4m cash monies, not so impressive when today you're worth over 800 times that, but why turn your nose down at it?
      </p>
      <p>
       Now he has to spend $250m to buy the WaPo, whut?
      </p>
      <p>
       The CIA really stuffed him there, I suppose he has to pay all the ongoing costs and figure out how to have them control the WaPo too? You don't offer any suggestions for us.
      </p>
      <p>
       Could it be that OP, who comes from T_D as a diehard messenger of Trump propaganda, is trying to discredit the WaPo with a pretty weak conspiracy?
      </p>
      <p>
       They do mention that the "New York Times, CNN, ABC News, CBS News, NBC News" have bene running the same kinds of stories. Does this credit the conspiracy and mean that the CIA are paying shitty bribes to the owners of all those media companies? Or does it mean the WaPo is acting no differently to media companies owned by someone who isn't CEO and shareholder in a company where the CIA aren't even a top 100 customer of a subsidiary?
      </p>
      <p>
       Btw who do the CIA buy their office supplies from?

       You're fighting the good fight man, but I'm afraid there's too much TD bias here. You're arguing with someone who responds like this:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Go to the kitchen and get a bowl.
       </p>
       <p>
        Fill it to the rim with a big serving of GO FUCK YOURSELF
       </p>
       <p>
        Add milk
       </p>
       <p>
        Enjoy.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       When TD sends folks here, they don't send the best. They don't send those who want to discuss in good faith. They send shitposters. Insulters. Trolls. Some I assume are good people though.

       Your argument is extremely fragile in that you seem to be more occupied with attacking OP with a sarcastic tone instead of standing firm on strong logic.
      </p>
      <p>
       Any of your points fall short considering the CIA injected a huge amount of cash that had the potential of changing a lot of things in a company. These sorts of deals almost always come with strings attached. Especially among transactions between companies which seem unrelated.

       Amazon had revenues of $74.45bn in 2013. An additional $600m in revenue over ten years isn't anything, it wouldn't even be 1% of their 2013 revenue if they got it all at once.

       $600mm is not a huge amount of cash for Amazon. It's a rather tiny amount, especially spread over a decade. This is a company that has transformed the brick and mortar retail landscape across the country.

       Operation Mockingbird: "...journalists are cheaper than whores." So, YES all mainstream media is bought and paid for by the intelligence groups.
      </p>
      <p>
       AP was purchased over 100 years ago by the Rothchilds.  Most MSM is trickled down from the AP and is the most commonly cited "source."  The Russian narrative is just another tool to drive division among the populace. The reality is Trump and Co. are beholden to Israel and the greater Israel initiative just like Obama and Hillary.  It's one gigantic mossad CIA NSA constant disfino misdirect divide and conquer campaign and it's the only thing we've ever known. The 4th estate has been co-opted thru nefarious means: ownership by proxy, murder, scandal, collusion, bribery, and of course the old stand by blackmail.  That's what all the net controls are about there's a resurgence of independent reporting and there's too many fish to keep their grubby fingers on now so their trying to poison the water.

       So can provide any sort of evidence that this is Operation Mockingbird or something like it? Because Jeff Bezos isn't a journalist, nor cheaper than a whore (your made up quote). The number just don't work.
      </p>
      <p>
       No the AP wasn't purchased by the Rothchilds. You're actually thinking of the lie about Reuters, try sourcing either.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most 'MSM' didn't "trickle down" from either. But again if you want to show a timeline and connections then go for it. Or in general try and provide proof of anything in your comment.

       Your comment was reasonable at the start and then you trailed off into nonsense. If you want to say that it's silly to suggest that amazon may have accepted government funding to save themselves since they were posting losses we can all agree with that. Amazon was clearly not in any trouble and of course intentionally posts losses so they can continue investing in themselves and growing. But the parts trying to suggest that the washington post isn't influenced by the CIA through jeff bezos are ridiculous.

       I was responding to the argument that the CIA contract is proof of influence.

       I broke that down and showed it didn't add up.

       You're not making any sort of real argument. If you are saying that they're influenced by the CIA via Bezos then how about trying to prove that? It's hard to disprove an assertion without evidence.

       No one said it was proof. OP stated facts and then went on to say what he believes based on those facts.
      </p>
      <p>
       You didn't break anything down or show that anything didn't add up. Here are your "points":
      </p>
      <p>
       1) This deal would have been bad for Jeff bezos because he had to spend more money than he would have made.
      </p>
      <p>
       This point is hilariously dumb because he BOUGHT A BUSINESS. It's not like the money disappeared. He bought something that will continue to earn money. And not just any business but a very important business for a businessman. There is a reason rich people and connected corporations own all the top news agencies--because it allows them to control the flow of information. If you are a businessman that is insanely important, especially if you are a sleazy one who might benefit from people being distracted from your dirty dealings.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not to mention he very likely would receive other benefits and connections for making this deal. Being at the top is all about networking. Even if he was at a loss for this, which he isn't, he would almost certainly benefit in many other ways just for doing it.
      </p>
      <p>
       On top of all that there is still the simple fact that they received this money. At the very least we know that they were contracted to do
       <em>
        something.
       </em>
       That alone leaves the door open for speculation and that ties into the fact that he owns a major news outlet.
      </p>
      <p>
       2) Your second point is that OP comes from T_D.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's not an argument. He may be inclined to push beliefs in support of trump, that is true, but it has nothing to do with his actual belief. If you want to refute it then make an argument against what he said. You failed to do that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or we can look at your account and see you're only 10 days old and everything you say is to distract from posts against official narratives and talk down on the sub and community on the whole if you want to play that game.
      </p>
      <p>
       3) You make the point that other news agencies act in similar ways.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is also a terrible point. All of these agencies are owned by powerful people. This post is focusing on WaPo but they are not being singled out. All the major news agencies act in similar ways because they are all in on it to varying degrees. For decades the news in this country has been controlled. We know that for a fact they more directly integrated with our government and there has been no indication that it stopped. WaPo seems the same as these other companies because they are the same--just not in the way you are suggesting.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, you didn't make a valid argument.

       He owns 17% of Amazon. Amazons revenue in 2013 was $74.45
       <em>
        billion
       </em>
       . The CIA contract with AWS was for 600 million over 10 years, meaning the yearly contribution towards Amazons annual revenues is a rounding error. That money does not go straight to Jeff Bezos' pocket, he gets cash by liquidating stock or taking salary+bonus.

       I work in tech, a billionaire used to sit on the other side of my office.
      </p>
      <p>
       One thing that spooks me is that most of these guys got ahead when the economy was complete shit. For instance, the economy in Seattle was completely cratered after the dot-com crash, and Amazon wouldn't be what it is today if it wasn't for thousands of unemployed techies in Seattle during 2000-2005. (Can confirm: I was one of them)

       2017 feels a lot like 1999, where everything was booming, and then it just ended overnight, went from boom to bust in no time

       I think it's quite a mixed bag. Fair enough Amazon, they have a real business going and started to build a cash reserve and declare a profit. But there are others that are fizzling out all ready along with all the crazy valuations and bad IPOs. I suppose more companies are private than in the dot-com era, the markets were the biggest issue then. Today there’s real money being invested into these startups directly, and real applications. It’s more a valuation problem in my mind. If you build some sweet tech someone might buy you but the price might be way too high, and if you’re providing a service but don’t have a way to monetise it? Hmm..
      </p>
      <p>
       Dunno if we’l see a crash, or just a series of smaller ‘corrections’ (such a good euphemism).

       There are a lot of "real" tech businesses right now, no doubt, but the labor market is just completely tapped out. Try finding a talented programmer in California who speaks English fluently. Literally 100% of them are employed.
      </p>
      <p>
       From a business perspective, this is a problem, it's like running an engine at 100% all the time. Eventually, it will break down.

       The crash in Y2K freed up a lot of talent, and that talent went on to build Amazon and Google
      </p>
      <p>
       The crash in 2008 freed up talent that worked on Facebook
      </p>
      <p>
       The economy can't continue to run at this pace; the current expansion is unsustainable

       Isn't it for like 60 million per year for 10 years?

      <p>
       THAT ISN'T A HUGE CONTRACT.  NETFLIX, most likely, PAYS THEM MORE.

       Hey Bezos, I know you're worth over $25

        billion

       but you might really be worried about spending $250m on WaPo. What if we sweeten the deal and give you a cut of $350m on the side through a CIA contract to Amazon
       <em>
        over ten years.

       Wouldn't that make it so much easier? It's not like you can afford WaPo on your own or anything with your literally 100x worth now can you?

       You can't like working with the CIA and having them—and extension the government—on your side is something to scoff. The CIA just doesn't hand out that kind of money for nothing. "Here, we are a spy and counter intelligence agency and we are going to give you $300 million for nothing in return." 😂

        The government was spending more money on information technology within the IC than ever before. IT spending reached $8 billion in 2013, according to budget documents leaked by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden. The CIA and other agencies feasibly could have spent billions of dollars standing up their own cloud infrastructure without raising many eyebrows in Congress, but the decision to purchase a single commercial solution came down primarily to two factors.
       </p>
       <p>
        “What we were really looking at was time to mission and innovation,” the former intelligence official said. “The goal was, ‘Can we act like a large enterprise in the corporate world and buy the thing that we don’t have, can we catch up to the commercial cycle? Anybody can build a data center, but could we purchase something more?
       </p>
       <p>
        “We decided we needed to buy innovation,” the former intelligence official said.

       Did you know the GAO ethics branch of the government was involved in this deal?
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        A month after the deal became public, IBM filed a bid protest with GAO that the watchdog eventually upheld in June, forcing the CIA to reopen bids to both companies for the contract. A legal struggle between Amazon and Big Blue ensued, and AWS filed a lawsuit against the federal government in July 2013, claiming the GAO sustainment was a “flawed” decision.
       </p>
       <p>
        In October, U.S. Court of Federal Claims Judge Thomas Wheeler sided with Amazon and overturned GAO’s decision to force the CIA to rebid the contract. Big Blue went home, AWS claimed victory under the deal’s original financial specs, and nearly 18 months after the procurement was first released, the CIA and Amazon went to work.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       You think IBM would've kept quiet if more nefarious things were going on?
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The Amazon-built cloud will operate behind the IC’s firewall, or more simply: It’s a public cloud built on private premises.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <h2>
      </h2>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        [...] Intelligence agencies will be able to host applications or order a variety of on-demand services like storage, computing and analytics. True to the National Institute of Standards and Technology definition of cloud computing, the IC cloud scales up or down to meet the need.
       </p>
       <p>
        In that regard, customers will pay only for services they actually use, which is expected to generate massive savings for the IC.
       </p>
       <p>
        “We see this as a tremendous opportunity to sharpen our focus and to be very efficient,” Wolfe told an audience at AWS’ annual nonprofit and government symposium in Washington. “We hope to get speed and scale out of the cloud, and a tremendous amount of efficiency in terms of folks traditionally using IT now using it in a cost-recovery way.”

       Doubt it. But IBM complained about the contract being awarded to Amazon and some documents related to that which have some details are out there.

       Amazon has not been profitable until 2013??
Is this is a tax-evasion thing?
I find it hard to believe massive transnational corporation Amazon hasn't been profitable until 4 years ago....it's been famous and around for ages.

       It's how reinvesting to grow your business works.
      </p>
      <p>
       Imagine if you ran an infinitely large warehouse. Rather than pocketing the profits over your means to live, you just use it to by more goods to sell. You don't pay taxes (by the Fed, state sales tax still happens on each sale) on the money you spent on cost of goods.
      </p>
      <p>
       So if you just keep rolling your profits back in and fill your tax free investment vehicles, you'll minimize the amount of tax you pay and still massively grow your business. This is the basic idea that most startup business owners use to get going. Just repeated reinvesting. Amazon did it longer than most businesses (running in the red), and it seems to have worked out well for them.

       As long as you continue to have investments you can make it work. They were in the red, but it was due to them creating the infrastructure that amazon uses today to provide their services. Despite being in the red, people understood that they were set to profit and kept investing.

       paying as few taxes as you are legally responsible for can be accomplished by anyone (non corrupt small business) with proper tax planning.
      </p>
      <p>
       The first area most business's reduce their tax burdens is with deductions.  Every dollar a business spends, gets spent before any taxes are removed.  They are allowed to deduct their expenses and only pay a small percentage of taxes on those expenses.  The government allows you to deduct things like business miles at 54 cents a mile.  Drive 10,000 business miles and that's a $5,400 deduction.
      </p>
      <p>
       Business's can also deduct things like restaurants, hotels, and other travel costs.   They can also carryover losses from prior (things like startup costs) years.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are lot's more advantages and strategies for reducing your tax burden.   A good accountant can save you a huge pile of cash.
       <br/>
       The "corrupt" business's we hear who paid little or no taxes, are almost always lies.  These companies are likely not corrupt.  They might not pay lets say any Federal taxes, they are paying millions in other taxes.  Taxes such as employee, social security, medicare, sales taxes, property taxes, state &amp; local.  Those reports are fake news.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've rambled on enough.  Sure it's not ELI5 quality, but hopefully it gives some insight.  Any questions let me know.

       Amazon is also funded by what is essentially loans from vendors. Amazon (and other retailers) usually have 45 or 60 days to pay vendors. So they get inventory, someone buys it and they get money, and now have that money for whatever time is left until they have to pay the vendor (say 30 days) to run the business.

       Yes, a lot of people will try to point to the Forbes list and say "look at those self made men!" But I think the truth is that for these men to become Billionaires, I believe that they sold out to organizations like the CIA.

       Just look who's on there. Jeff Bezos, Zuckerberg, Larry Ellison of Oracle, who worked for the CIA before. Even the name Oracle, suggests omnipresence, always watching, and Java is installed on almost every device.

       Look at the AMZN stock chart, and multiply the stock price with the amount of shares he owns. Or multiply the stock price with shares outstanding and his percentage ownership to get an approximate value of his net worth.

       Amazon isn't profitable because the company is building an empire.  They are making billions and spending more.  The goal is to be the first and last source in consumption.

       Bezos does not need the Post now but it will be useful later.  The newspaper is in a golden age.  There's lots of money and editorial freedom.  The credibility for legitimate journalism they're doing now will leveraged in the future.

       While Bezos is definitely a sketchy dude and I don't trust his as far as I can throw him, this type of thing isn't uncommon. A company like Amazon has massive overhead costs associated with doing business meaning they had to invest a ton of money and resources just to get it functioning properly. This means a number of years of posting losses until they eventually get infrastructure in place and can start turning a profit.
