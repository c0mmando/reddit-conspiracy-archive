    <div class="md"><p>That part of the narrative, that they were killed in Mena for seeing drugs being unloaded, makes absolutely no sense to anyone actually from Arkansas. I just have to bring it up every time it gets mentioned. Mena to Arkansas what Carson City is to Nevada. It&#39;s there, but there are a lot better places to go to if you want to actually do something. The only passable reason to go to Mena is for fall scenery, and there&#39;s none of that going on in August.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It takes close to 2 hours to get to Mena from Benton/Bryant.  Another 2 hours  to get back. They were found 3 hours after they left home (on foot). Time-wise it would be impossible.</p>

<p>They would have had to leave home, get to Mena, witness the drug deal, get murdered, killer would then have to figure out where to take them (they frequented the tracks for spotlighting), been transported, laid on the tracks, and the killer gets out of the area all in less than the time to make the trip.</p>

<p>The Mena-Clinton drug conspiracy has strong evidence, but it&#39;s unrelated to this. </p>

<p>This is a local conspiracy about police covering up their murder.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Local authorities had it covered up, because they were involved in the drug scene here. It is also rumored around that the boys found police officers at the drop point on the tracks, along with the other 3 individuals there. These rumors came about immediately after the bodies were found. My wife&#39;s Uncle Buddy was a fireman back then, and he said it was county-wide. Everyone was on the take. He brought it frequently throughout the years until he passed a couple years ago. Judges, police, lawyers, the Mayor, city council..... Everyone. THEY did this to protect themselves. Everyone they thought would rat was killed until people were too scared to even talk about it. This is common knowledge here. Some of the same people and they families still run this area. They are very influential and scared of nothing. Their game switched to meth in the late 90s and remains today. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lets explore this. Drugs shipped in from Central America to Mena. This means the local police HAD to be on the take too..other officials as well (Town, City etc).  This is why the cover up happened on all levels. Otherwise someone would sound a whistle. The kids MAY have seen something not even close to Mena but since it tied to something bigger it would have ended in the same way using the same tactics. </p>

<p>Laragon stated  &quot;That part of the narrative, that they were killed in Mena for seeing drugs being unloaded, makes absolutely no sense to anyone&quot;</p>

<p>And Kevin and Don were NOT killed anywhere near Mena, so his premise right off the bat is wrong.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Who said Kevin and Don were killed anywhere near Mena???</p>

<p>They were murdered about a mile from Don Henry&#39;s home in Alexander.</p>

<p>The plane that made the drug drop they witnessed flew out of Mena, and that drop was just one of the many different routes from the smuggling operations that was first set up by Barry Seal in 1982, who was himself killed a year before Kevin and Don.</p>

<p>Even though Seal was murdered, his operations were left intact and still running, which is part of the reason for the cover-up in Kevin and Don&#39;s murders.
The question of WHY Kevin and Don were killed, leads back to Mena.
Kevin and Don were never at Mena.</p>

<p>Watch the &quot;Detailed documentary&quot; in the OP and understand the case.</p>

<p>Something to keep in mind also, is that while the video is not a Clinton bash-fest, and barely mentions Clinton, take a look at how many officials are CORRUPT that all served under Clinton Governorship. That in itself speaks volumes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do you like conspiracies? <strong>This rabbit hole runs deep</strong>: </p>

<p>The murdered boys apparently witnessed illegal activities by members of a group involved in a massive conspiracy involving some of the most powerful organizations and ruthless people in the world - including the CIA, Mossad, Mafia, and elements within the governments of the US, Israel, Panama, El Salvador, Iran and others. </p>

<p>A few of the Key players in this vast conspiracy allegedly included: VP George W. Bush; AR Gov. Bill <em>(and Hillary?)</em> Clinton; Panama dictator Colonel Manuel Noriega and his close associate <a href="https://archive.is/F9q5Z">Michael Harari</a>, an agent for the Israeli Mossad.</p>

<p>At the time, Mena Intermountain Municipal Airport was a central hub for clandestine operations, used to circumvent Customs and Border Patrol scrutiny. </p>

<p>Cargo being Flown into the Mena airport from Panama were Drugs and &quot;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contras"><strong>Contra Rebel</strong></a>&quot; soldiers from El Salvador who were brought in for training in secret US facilities. The drugs would move into the US black market, and soldiers who had finished training were shipped back to Panama, along with cash and weaponry.</p>

<p>On Jun 21, 1991, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_J._Brenneke"><strong>Richard J. Brenneke</strong></a> gave a sworn oral deposition before US Congressman <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Vollie_Alexander_Jr.">William Alexander Jr</a> and Chad Farris, Chief Deputy Attorney General for the state of Arkansas.  Brenneke answered questions regarding the role the role he played related to CIA operations at Mena airport.</p>

<p>Below are a few snippets from that deposition:</p>

<p><a href="https://archive.is/FlXxt"><strong>Joint Investigation by Arkansas State Attorney General&#39;s Office and The United States Congress</strong></a></p>

<p>[...]</p>

<p>Q. So you were an independent contractor with the Central Intelligence Agency?</p>

<p>A. That&#39;s correct.</p>

<p>Q. Beginning when and through what years?</p>

<p>A. 1968 through about 1986, somewhere in 1985, ‘86 is when I called it off.</p>

<p>Q. So what services did you perform for the Central Intelligence Agency?</p>

<p>A. Specialized in two activities; I handled money for them, I handled East Bloc weapons purchases primarily made in Yugoslavia and Czechoslovakia.</p>

<p>[...]</p>

<p>Q. Did you ever pilot an aircraft to a location at Mena, Arkansas?</p>

<p>A. Yes, sir. I did on a number of occasions.</p>

<p>Q. And what aircraft did you fly into Mena?</p>

<p>A. I generally flew a C 130. Aircraft would be brought into Mena, the first trips that I made started in early &#39;84.</p>

<p>Q. I see. Were you based out of Mena for a period of time?</p>

<p>A. That would be a very appropriate description.</p>

<p>Q. How many flights would you say that you made from the Mena, Arkansas airport for the CIA during the period of time that you worked for them?</p>

<p>A. Ten to twelve.</p>

<p>Q. Ten to twelve flights. And you flew a C 130?</p>

<p>A. Generally flew a C 130. I did, however, on occasion come in -- on one occasion specifically I recall coming in on a Lear Jet, on one occasion on a 400 Series Cessna.</p>

<p>[...]</p>

<p>Q. Allright. Now, Mr. Brenneke, could you tell us when you first made a flight for the CIA from Mena, Arkansas?</p>

<p>A. It would have been March, April of 1984.</p>

<p>Q. 1984. And what was the cargo that you transported for the CIA from Mena?</p>

<p>A. From Mena?</p>

<p>Q. Yes.</p>

<p>A. Okay. From Mena I would take people who had been trained in the area around Mena, generally paramilitary or military forces from Central America. They would be taken back to Panama City, where I would drop them. And, in addition to that, we would carry weapons that were being shipped down there. The weapons, as I&#39;ve said, frequently came either from government stores or through Tamiami Gun Shop in Miami, Florida.</p>

<p>[...]</p>

<p>Q. Now, can you identify for the record some of the kinds of guns that were being shipped from Mena to Central America?</p>

<p>A. M l&#39;s, M l rifles, recoil -- small recoilless rifles, 106, I&#39;ve forgotten the exact caliber on it, grenades, ammunition for these weapons, fuses, detonator fuses. And I remember that one very specifically because it only happened once. But we had detonator fuses on board, and my concern was that we might have the equipment being detonated on the same flight, and I didn&#39;t want that.</p>

<p>[...]</p>

<p>Q. I see. So as I understand it, they would load the guns and munitions on the C 130, and you and a co pilot, one of whom you&#39;ve identified as Harry Rupp --</p>

<p>A. Uh huh.</p>

<p>Q. -- would fly these munitions and equipment to locations in Central America. Where was the cargo destined for? Where did you fly it to?</p>

<p>A. We flew it to Panama City and offloaded it there.</p>

<p>Q. Do you remember where in Panama City?</p>

<p>A. Panama -- at Tecuman Airport.</p>

<p>[...]</p>

<p>Q. Now, could -- were the shipments met by people in Panama?</p>

<p>A. Yes, they were. They were met by military types who wore military uniforms and were easily identified as members of the Panamanian Defense Force, which essentially is the Palace Guard.</p>

<p>Q. Allright. Do you know any of the people? Did you recognize any of the PDF forces that met these shipments&#39;</p>

<p>A. I recognized them -- I did not know the names of all of them; however, <strong>I did know the name of the man who trained them, and he would frequently be there to meet the shipments, and he is a man by the name of Michael Harari.</strong></p>

<p>Q. Who is Michael Harari? </p>

<p>A. <strong>Mike Harari was a Mossad agent. He’s an Israeli national.</strong> My best understanding is he lives in Israel right now. He was Manuel Noriega&#39;s partner in a number of business deals in Panama. I know that firsthand because I had to deal with him.</p>

<p>[...]</p>

<p>Q. Now, you would stay a night or a couple of days and you returned. <strong>And would you return with a cargo?</strong></p>

<p>A. Yes, sir, we would. We would come back with individuals, and from time to time unmarked boxes of items that were put in the aircraft along with the individuals. Now, being conservative by nature and not having a death wish, <strong>I opened the boxes on a number of occasions to find out what I was flying</strong>. And what --</p>

<p>Q. What did you discover the cargo to be?</p>

<p>A. <strong>I found the cargo to be cocaine, in some cases marijuana</strong>.</p>

<p>Q. Now, would you describe what you saw when you opened the boxes?</p>

<p>A. What I saw when I opened the boxes were plastic bags filled with a white powdery substance. On one occasion I wanted to know more about what it was, so I cut one of them open and tasted it, and I have tasted cocaine in a controlled environment before at the request of law enforcement officials, so this --</p>

<p>Q. <strong>So you positively identified the substances that you were carrying as cocaine?</strong></p>

<p>A. <strong>Yes, sir, I did</strong>.</p>

<p>Q. How much cocaine would you judge that you were carrying?</p>

<p>A. In the course of time there?</p>

<p>Q. Well, in each load?</p>

<p>A. <strong>In each load, 4 to 600 pounds</strong>.</p>

<p>[...]</p>

<p>Q. Now, what would you do with the load of cocaine once it was loaded onto your C-130; where would you go with it?</p>

<p>A. <strong>We would bring it to Mena, Arkansas</strong>.</p>

<p>[...]</p>

<p>Q. And when you landed at Mena, what would be the disposition of the cargo.</p>

<p>A. On one or two occasions the cargo was taken off by people who were not residents of the Mena area and put into other aircraft which departed from there. However, the most frequent activity was that the aircraft would be unloaded in front of Rich Mountain Aviation&#39;s hangers and it would be stored in the back of the hanger.</p>

<p>[...]</p>

<p>Q. And go back in your mind to the first trip you took and describe to me the disposition of the cargo; that is, the cocaine, once it returned to Arkansas, once it was delivered to Arkansas? And I am especially I am particularly interested in the identification of persons other than Freddie Hampton. You&#39;ve talked about Freddie Hampton. You&#39;ve identified him. <strong>Can you identify other people who might have received this cocaine?</strong></p>

<p>A. Yes. I can identify people who in fact received the cocaine, not “might have.” And --</p>

<p>Q. Can you tell us who they were?</p>

<p>A. I can tell you that <strong>they were members of John Gotti&#39;s</strong> <em>[crime]</em> <strong>family in New York</strong>. One of them was an individual known to me by the name of Sal Reale.</p>

<p>[...]</p>

<p>Q. And how did you know Mr. Reale?</p>

<p>A. Mr. Reale at that time was the Director of -- I believe it was that time, was the <strong>Director of Security for Kennedy International Airport in New York Cit</strong>y.</p>

<p>Q. In New York City. Speak to the subject of your knowledge of Mr. Reale and his activities as the head of security at Kennedy? Tell us what you know about him and what he did?</p>

<p>A. Okay. <strong>Mr. Reale was a -- was one of Mr. Gotti&#39;s lieutenants</strong>. I watched the two of them interact. Mr. Gotti would provide directions, Mr. Reale would carry them out. <strong>It was his job to make sure that cargo being shipped through Kennedy was not lost, but properly located, and in some cases avoiding customs -- avoided the customs procedures.</strong></p>

<p>Q. Are you saying that you saw Mr. John Gotti, the famous bead of the organized crime syndicate, in New York together with Mr. Reale?</p>

<p>A. Yes, sir, I did.</p>

<p>[...]</p>

<p>Q. So you worked for Mr. Gotti as well as for the CIA?</p>

<p>A. Actually the CIA told me to do that on his behalf.</p>

<p>Q. So the CIA was in, would you say, partnership or association with Mr. Gotti?</p>

<p>A. Yes, sir. I would say a partnership.</p>

<p>Q. And can you describe the nature of that partnership?</p>

<p>A. Sure. The organized crime members had a need for two things; they needed drugs brought into the country on a reliable, safe basis, they needed people taken out of the country or people brought into the country without alerting customs or INS to the fact that they were being brought into the country, they also needed their money taken offshore so that it would not be subject to United States tax where they might have to declare its source. And so we performed these kinds of functions for them.</p>

<h1>Q. Mr. Brenneke, are you saying that the CIA was in the business of bringing drugs into the United States?</h1>

<h1>A. Yes, sir. That&#39;s exactly what I&#39;m saying.</h1>

    <div class="md"><p>Sharline Wilson. </p>

<p>She was Dan Harmon&#39;s girlfriend at the time of the murders and, later in 1993 confessed to being at the tracks that night with Harmon, and others, and also confessed to stabbing one of the boys(Don Henry) in the back.(Note - The first autopsy done by Fahmy Malak was a pile of BS revealing nothing but lies, and the second autopsy, done by Joseph Burton revealed the stab wound in Don&#39;s back)</p>

<p>Wilson passed polygraphs, and had the support of the 7th Judicial District Drug Task Force chief Jean Duffey in as far as her truthfulness concerning her testimony given.</p>

<p>Because Wilson gave testimony, Harmon, who by that time was 7th Judicial District&#39;s Prosecutor, busted Wilson, personally, and then prosecuted her in court, personally, I believe under Judge John Cole(though I may be mistaken about that one), and sentenced to 31 years for a first time offense of possession of narcotics under $100... I also believe some gun-related charges were involved as well.</p>

<p>After Harmon himself was convicted of numerous felonies, including drug charges and racketeering, and sentenced to 10 years in prison, in 1997, a petition was started to free Sharline Wilson from her 31 year sentence.</p>

<p>Wilson was released in 1999 under a Pardon by then Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee, and she by that time had &quot;found God&quot;... gave a few limited interviews, and has kept her mouth shut since.</p>

<p>In 2015, a retired police officer friend of Linda Ives who still had access to the case files, went through them again, and somehow found the 4-page confession letter that they did not know existed anymore, and took it back to Linda Ives.</p>

<p>They then went to Prosecutor Ken Casady, who wouldn&#39;t even look at it and he told them to go to Saline Sheriff Rodney Wright.</p>

<p>Rodney Wright just so happens to be Dan Harmon&#39;s nephew!</p>

<p>Does it get any crazier???</p>

<p>Rodney Wright told Linda Ives that he needed a Warrant to summon Sharline Wilson in to testify and referred Linda back to Ken Casady. Hmmm.</p>

<p>Last I heard, during the election campaign last year, Sharline Wilson was trying to get in touch with one of the people involved with the FBI during the case in the 1990&#39;s.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Cheers!</p>

<p>Sharline Wilson, Dan Harmon, Jay Campbell and Kirk Lane are all still alive and IMO, should all be brought in for the murders of Kevin and Don.</p>

<p>It&#39;s clear that Harmon and Wilson were there at the tracks... And there&#39;s enough questions surrounding Campbell and Lane to include them in at least being questioned... and possibly? indicted as well. I personally believe so.</p>

<p>The story goes that Don and Kevin were walking along the tracks and ran into a group that included Dan Harmon... Sharlene Wilson was in the car about a mile away(as back then the road didn&#39;t extend to the tracks where the others were)... Harmon summoned the boys and they hesitated and a shot was fired and the boys ran off(this is according to witness Tom Neihuas, who passed FBI polygraphs)... They boys ran into Keith Coney(who would also be killed less than a year later) at some point, and the three boys end up at the payphone on the side of the Ranchette Grocery Store... 2 different witnesses then report seeing 2 police officers in an unmarked car pull up... Keith Coney then takes off on his motorcycle... and the 2 witnesses both say they saw the 2 police officers beat the shit out of the 2 boys and throw them into the back of the unmarked cruiser... One witness names one of the officers as Kirk Lane... their description of the 2 officers match that of Kirk Lane and Jay Campbell... What exactly happens next is unknown, but it is presumed that Campbell and Lane bring the boys back to Harmon and company on the tracks, and then leave... Then Sharline Wilson makes her way to the tracks after doing a whole whack of drugs in the car, and from her confession letter she states the boys are already &quot;deceased&quot; by this point... and goes on to describe how she stabbed on of them in the back &quot;but not that hard&quot;, to paraphrase.</p>

<p>There are plenty of others still alive to be brought forward in a trial as well both the guilty(in the cover up) and witnesses.</p>

<p>But getting the trial is the damned hard part.</p>

<p>You&#39;re &quot;guess&quot; is a pretty good one I agree. All we can do is keep making more people aware of the truth of things.</p>

<p>Again, cheers mate!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Federal government didn&#39;t want them dead. Nor the State.
They witnessed a drug drop that prosecutor Dan Harmon, and others, were going to retrieve. Some witnesses also implicate Local police Jay Campbell and Kirk Lane as being involved in killing the boys. A written and taped confession by Sharline Wilson in 1993 states she stabbed &quot;one of the boys in the back&quot; at the train tracks(something discovered in the second autopsy, but somehow missed in the original, hmmm), and she also states that Dan Harmon was there at the tracks(with others) in her confession. Another witness, Tom Neihaus, was hiding in the bushes watching the first incident with the boys on the tracks, and placed Dan Harmon on the tracks with Kevin and Don at one point as well. Both Sharline Wilson and Tom Neihaus passed multiple FBI polygraphs in their questioning.</p>

<p>It all started at the local level, but because the drug drop originated out of Mena Airport, and was an extension of the Iran/Contra/Cocaine scandal that was only exposed a year earlier, the murders had to be covered up, because the question of WHY they were murdered would expose the long-running operations out of the Mena Airport that were being run by the CIA, under then VP HW Bush, with the help of then Arkansas Governor Bill Clinton.
They completely got away with all the operations that happened out of Mena Airport during the 1980&#39;s and on.</p>

<p>Research Iran/Contra... FULLY... don&#39;t listen to just the BS MSM-friendly version.
Here&#39;s a hint that we were all conned and scammed about Iran/Contra... For ALL the crimes committed in the Iran/Contra scandal, only ONE person went to jail... Thomas Clines, for under-reporting on some taxes. That&#39;s it.
Stealing US weaponry, selling it to Iran under embargo, sending money and weaponry to the Contras against the Boland Act, and the biggie, turning a blind eye(at the very least) to the 100&#39;s of tons of cocaine being brought into the U.S. by the very pilots that were bring the guns down to the Contra rebels.
Plus a whole bunch of other crimes.
But only ONE person in the government goes to jail for that!?
rrrRight.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s some irony from it all...
Oliver North was guilty a hell in all of this, and knew about the cocaine coming into the US, and of course didn&#39;t care... Don&#39;t forget how he famously shredded THOUSANDS of documents too... Then there&#39;s Gary Webb, who released his Dark Alliance series in 1996 on the San Jose Mercury News&#39; website, which exposed the CIA&#39;s link to the cocaine flow coming into Los Angeles.
Fast forward a number of years, and we see Oliver North actually as a guest commentator on Fox News(kinda like a journalist almost you could say)... and meanwhile, the actual journalist who wrote about the truth, would allegedly commit suicide, by shooting himself in the head... twice... with a .38... go figure.</p>

<p>We&#39;ve been lied to for decades with the Bush&#39;s and Clinton&#39;s leading the way... hand in hand.
And you can look to Obama&#39;s first Cabinet to see where his loyalties were right from the start of his Presidency.</p>

<p>Keep researching... and stay away from CNN, they&#39;re damned TERRIBLE! ;)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It takes close to 2 hours to get to Mena from Benton/Bryant.  Another 2 hours  to get back. They were found 3 hours after they left home (on foot). Time-wise it would be impossible.</p>

<p>They would have had to leave home, get to Mena, witness the drug deal, get murdered, killer would then have to figure out where to take them (they frequented the tracks for spotlighting), been transported, laid on the tracks, and the killer gets out of the area all in less than the time to make the trip.</p>

<p>The Mena-Clinton drug conspiracy has strong evidence, but it&#39;s unrelated to this. </p>

<p>This is a local conspiracy about police covering up their murder.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Watch the &quot;Detailed documentary&quot; in the OP.(I&#39;ll link it again below)</p>

<p>You should read the FBI files in the video instead of just a post of someone that was mistaken in their description of what happened.</p>

<p>Laragon stated  &quot;That part of the narrative, that they were killed in Mena for seeing drugs being unloaded, makes absolutely no sense to anyone&quot;</p>

<p>And Kevin and Don were NOT killed anywhere near Mena, so his premise right off the bat is wrong.</p>
