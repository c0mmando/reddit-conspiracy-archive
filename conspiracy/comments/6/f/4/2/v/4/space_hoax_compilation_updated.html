       Which organizations are shilling against this narrative on this subreddit?
      </p>
      <p>
       While I don't rule out the possibility that we never reached the moon, if anything, I would suspect shills push this narrative to undermine credibility in
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">

       Nonetheless I'm open to learning more about who (NASA?) might shill as you describe.

       I don't believe this stuff. I've watched every video on this list, and almost none of them match up. You can get your own evidence against this just by borrowing a telescope or going to an astronomy club. I've seen Saturn, Pluto, Jupiter, Neptune, and other planets and celestial objects myself. Heck, I've even contacted the ISS via ham radio and spoke to them.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is nothing to gain, by anyone to lie about space. If anything I'd say that we've been to space a hell of a lot more than the government says, and that's a far more likely possibility.

       Moreover, you can launch your own satellite to LEO in less than 100k. Have it deployed from the ISS, record it from the outside, take images of all the UFOs and receive the data with your own ham.

       That's it thank you. Not to mention China is intending on putting men on the moon shortly and bringing all their HD Gear with them. Maybe a 20000k panoramic landscape video from the mood will change your mind as it will be unfeasible to edit fake elements from the entire thing.

       If they're spending billions on that shit there isn't anything left to launder.

       Also I have a strange feeling it's not even 200 million. Much less BILLIONS.

       None of these videos claimed that Saturn, Pluto, Jupiter, Neptune, and other planets don't exist. They simply state that they are not what NASA depicts them to be. There is a video that depicts what Venus looks like using a telescope vs. what NASA purports Venus to look like. Venus obviously appears to be a translucent light, not a physical astronomical body.

       My comment wasn't confrontational, so I'm not sure why you were so defensive in your response.
      </p>
      <p>
       You don't have to know to accuse, I just wanted to know if there was a particular agency or organization. It sounds like you are not aware of any, which isn't surprising since there are lots of shilling orgs we don't know about.
      </p>
      <p>
       The credibility of the community as perceived by new users and by occasional users. I'm not convinced shills only push mainstream media. My theory is that flat Earth is largely a psyop used to discredit conspiracy theorists because it is such an incredible paradigm shift that communication is almost impossible between a person who believes in flat Earth and a person who believes in the mainstream perspective.

       Nobody cares what you think. Back it up with some proof. Flat Earth is a dinsinfo psyop? Prove it. We have declassified documentation from the CIA on multiple secret programs and psyops so where's

       Its so outrageous and anyone with a spare afternoon can prove it to themselves. Get a telescope and tell me what you see. Im willing to bet youve never stepped near a telescope but proclaim to have all the answers lol.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its so when conspiracy theorists start getting things right people can point to ridiculous bullshit like FE and Cell Earth to discredit the conspiracies that are hitting close to home. Look up the documentary Mirage Men. Not sure if its on youtube so I dont know if you will watch it.

       Because its so easily debunked by anyone with a few minutes to do the research.

       I thought I did? It is so incredibly simple to disprove the FE model that nearly anyone can do it with minimal effort. This means to me (A conspiracy theory if you will) that there is a concerted effort to push this narrative in conspiracy circles to discredit them...
      </p>
      <p>
       As I stated previously (If you missed it) check out the documentary Mirage Men, it covers a very similar topic on how the government discredited the UFO movement. I believe this is similar, at least I hope because the other option is that people are intellectually lazy and unable or unwilling to do their own research.
      </p>
      <p>
       Can you see where Im going with this? Look into it lol instead of being aggressive. Or are you one of the disinfo agents?

       Just so we are clear, you have never used a telescope but you believe the Earth is flat? I hope you realize now what I mean when I say intellectually lazy. You watch youtube videos but you never put forth the actual effort to look into it yourself lol, you are exactly who I mean when I say intellectually lazy.
      </p>
      <p>
       You believe the Earth is flat but never bought a telescope. It would be like a guy saying "AUSTRALIA ISNT REAL!" (Coincidentally a FE position that some hold) but he never bothers to book a flight to Australia and see.

       Again I'm thinking critical thinking isn't your deal which explains why you believe in a FE. Once more since it's not sinking in, FE is so easily debunked there is no way it's an organic movement. Yes that's my opinion, a conspiracy theory if you will.

       My comment wasn't confrontational, so I'm not sure why you were so defensive in your response.
      </p>

       You don't have to know to accuse, I just wanted to know if there was a particular agency or organization. It sounds like you are not aware of any, which isn't surprising since there are lots of shilling orgs we don't know about.

       The credibility of the community as perceived by new users and by occasional users. I'm not convinced shills only push mainstream media. My theory is that flat Earth is largely a psyop used to discredit conspiracy theorists because it is such an incredible paradigm shift that communication is almost impossible between a person who believes in flat Earth and a person who believes in the mainstream perspective.

        Shills come in and push the MAINSTREAM narrative which is incredibly obvious at this point.
