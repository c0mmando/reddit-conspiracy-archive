        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>

<p>After working with children for many years, I have been able to directly and indirectly examine the beliefs, paradigms, and perceptions of children in American culture. When I was working on my bachelor’s degree, I remember my college professor brought up the fact that many teachers oppose Roald Dahl books such as <em>Matilda</em> or <em>Charlie and the Chocolate Factory</em> because they paint adults as evil and unwise and children as innocent and wise. At the time, I thought this concept was a little ridiculous, and it even irritated me. Was isn’t it true, after all?
Over the years, I have examined this concept further and further, and I am starting to believe that there is a purposeful inversion of <em>the adult vs. the child</em> in our society. I want to examine this inversion, its possible causes, and its possible implications and consequences in this post. For the purpose of this post, I am using children to identify ages from 3ish to 16ish.</p>

<p><strong>Treating Children as Little Adults</strong></p>

<p>More and more, our society is treating children as if they are tiny adults, capable of adult decisions. This really, really bothers me, especially as a teacher.</p>

<p>More and more, parents fear disciplining children for a variety of reasons. Some want to be their children’s friends, some fear upsetting children, and some feel that children do not need the guidance of adults to learn lessons.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1251426/Modern-parents-avoid-discipline-fear-upsetting-children.html">http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1251426/Modern-parents-avoid-discipline-fear-upsetting-children.html</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.romper.com/p/studies-prove-millennial-parents-are-disciplining-their-kids-less-than-their-parents-43769">https://www.romper.com/p/studies-prove-millennial-parents-are-disciplining-their-kids-less-than-their-parents-43769</a></p>

<p>Why is it that many parents are having more difficulty separating themselves from their children? For example, more are treating their children as their friends:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/educationnews/11077075/Parents-told-stop-treating-your-children-as-friends.html">http://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/educationnews/11077075/Parents-told-stop-treating-your-children-as-friends.html</a></p>

<p>Not only does there appear to be a problem in parents creating boundaries with their children, but it also seems that children are  being exposed to increasingly adult concepts at earlier ages, and moreover, they are being allowed to make increasingly adult decisions.</p>

<p>This can go in many directions, but I wanted to focus on a few key areas:</p>

<p>1) Parents are saying children can identify their gender as early as 3:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-lgbt-parenting-idUSKBN14B1C8">http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-lgbt-parenting-idUSKBN14B1C8</a></p>

<p>Would you let a child make an adult decision like that at 3, such as getting a tattoo?</p>

<p>2) More and more children are being dressed as tiny adults. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.clutchmagonline.com/2012/08/remember-when-kids-dressed-like-kids-not-miniature-adults/">http://www.clutchmagonline.com/2012/08/remember-when-kids-dressed-like-kids-not-miniature-adults/</a></p>

<p>What happened to the more innocent designs of previous generations?</p>

<p>3) More and more reality shows are based on children in extremely adult roles:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.complex.com/pop-culture/2011/08/the-10-most-uncomfortable-reality-shows-about-kids/i-know-my-kids-a-star">http://www.complex.com/pop-culture/2011/08/the-10-most-uncomfortable-reality-shows-about-kids/i-know-my-kids-a-star</a></p>

<p>4) Technology is allowing children to have more access than ever to adult themes and concepts.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/08/i-didnt-expect-to-find-pornography-in-my-9-year-olds-web-history/375896/">https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/08/i-didnt-expect-to-find-pornography-in-my-9-year-olds-web-history/375896/</a></p>

<p>5) Kids are actually facing addiction to technology. 
<a href="http://metro.co.uk/2017/01/05/tech-addiction-is-digital-heroin-for-kids-turning-children-into-screen-junkies-6363567/">http://metro.co.uk/2017/01/05/tech-addiction-is-digital-heroin-for-kids-turning-children-into-screen-junkies-6363567/</a></p>

<p>Why is this acceptable? When were kids “addicted” to items in the past? This is disturbing. </p>

<p>6) Kids are growing up faster/hitting puberty faster.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/oct/25/early-puberty-growing-up-faster">https://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/oct/25/early-puberty-growing-up-faster</a></p>

<p>This topic could go in a lot of directions, and I would love to hear your thoughts.</p>

<p>There is something odd about all of these links, and again, while this post can go in many directions, I want to ask, why are we treating children as if they are tiny adults? Or is it better to say that the boundary between children and adult is becoming murkier?</p>

<p>One may argue that perceptions of children have changed over time, and that is absolutely true. To keep this post to the point, however, I want to focus on more modern views of children and a ‘shift’ that has occurred in the past century or so. Kimberly Reynolds writes,</p>

<p>“Some, however, did not see childhood as a state to be hurried through in order to achieve adulthood. The 19th century saw the development of what is sometimes called the Cult of Childhood, with adults exultantly celebrating childhood in texts and images. The connections with the Romantic ideal of childhood are clear, but many writers of the ‘Golden Age’ of children’s literature (beginning in the 1860s with Charles Kingsley’s The Water-Babies, 1863, and Lewis Carroll’s Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland, 1865) went further, even expressing a longing themselves to be children once more.”</p>

<p><a href="https://www.bl.uk/romantics-and-victorians/articles/perceptions-of-childhood">https://www.bl.uk/romantics-and-victorians/articles/perceptions-of-childhood</a>    </p>

<p>In fact, the term “teenager” is fairly modern:</p>

<p>“In the 19th century, the American world consisted of children and adults. Most Americans tried their best to allow their children to enjoy their youth while they were slowly prepared for the trials and tribulations of adulthood. Although child labor practices still existed, more and more states were passing restrictions against such exploitation. The average number of years spent in school for young Americans was also on the rise. Parents were waiting longer to goad their youngsters into marriage rather than pairing them off at the tender age of sixteen or seventeen. In short, it soon became apparent that a new stage of life — the TEENAGE phase — was becoming a reality in America. American adolescents were displaying traits unknown among children and adults. Although the word teenager did not come into use until decades later, the teenage mindset dawned in the 1920s.”
<a href="http://www.ushistory.org/us/46c.asp">http://www.ushistory.org/us/46c.asp</a></p>

<p>Still, even with this “invention” of teenage years, one can still argue that children are losing their childhoods, and being forced to grow up faster and faster, acting more like tweens, teenagers, and adults. </p>

<p><strong>Vanity and Youth</strong></p>

<p>Meanwhile, adults seem to be acting more like children. Could it be that this strange “Cult of Childhood” is more about living through our children, or could it, perhaps, be even deeper? Is this newer “obsession” with children directly correlated with our fear of death and our obsession with immortality?</p>

<p>It is probably impossible to deny that our society places huge value on looking young, feeling young, and bringing out our inner child. If we “live through our children” and treat them as mini-adults, are we extending our youth?</p>

<p><a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/matter-personality/201109/living-vicariously-through-children-twist">https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/matter-personality/201109/living-vicariously-through-children-twist</a></p>

<p>How many parents do you know who seem to be obsessed with updating every aspect of their children’s lives on social media, as if they do not have lives of their own? Still, even for those who do not have children, many want to live as though they are forever young. </p>

<p>Through social media, are we able to maintain this “youthful” sort of presence, by not only living through children, but presenting our live as exciting, adventurous, and energetic? We can select the perfect photos, the perfect words, and the perfect attitudes we present to the world. We can eternalize ourselves and forever maintain &quot;youth&quot; online, or if at least not youth, than perhaps immortality?</p>

<p>In our society, aging is generally villifed, and Americans have a preoccupation with staying young:</p>

<p>This article points out, </p>

<p>“Throughout the advance in technology the quest to remain young has accelerated at warp speed. Why, when previously gray hair and wrinkles coincided with patience, self-awareness and wisdom? As Hannibal Lecter told Clarice in &#39;Silence of the Lambs&#39;, &quot;We begin by coveting what we see every day.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/reading-between-the-headlines/201310/forever-young-americas-obsession-never-growing-old">https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/reading-between-the-headlines/201310/forever-young-americas-obsession-never-growing-old</a></p>

<p>So there appears to be two things going on here. People’s treatment of children is more and more adult-like, and at the same time, adults seem obsessed with preservation of youth.
Does there seem to be some type of inversion or flip of our childhood/adulthood schemas? </p>

<p><strong>Wisdom Wasted on the Wise</strong></p>

<p>On a philosophical level, are we ‘losing’ the lessons of the wise in the quest for youth and immortality?</p>

<p>If you are not familiar, <em>Tuck Everlasting</em> is a pretty famous novel about a family that chooses to live forever. It is a great book that I love to read with my 6th graders, and the ultimate theme seems to be that the cycle of life is important – there is a time and necessity for all parts of life.</p>

<p>To quote the bible:</p>

<p>A Time for Everything
3 There is a time for everything,
    and a season for every activity under the heavens:
2     a time to be born and a time to die,
    a time to plant and a time to uproot,
3     a time to kill and a time to heal,
    a time to tear down and a time to build,
4     a time to weep and a time to laugh,
    a time to mourn and a time to dance,
5     a time to scatter stones and a time to gather them,
    a time to embrace and a time to refrain from embracing,
6     a time to search and a time to give up,
    a time to keep and a time to throw away,
7     a time to tear and a time to mend,
    a time to be silent and a time to speak,
8     a time to love and a time to hate,
    a time for war and a time for peace.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ecclesiastes+3">https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ecclesiastes+3</a></p>

<p>Have we arrived at a point in our society where we fear to examine the moral necessity of death or aging? Are we losing the ability to think about ourselves beyond our physical selves? As our society continually moves toward technological innovation and evolution, are we losing a sense of any level of existential or spiritual thought, understanding, or philosophy?</p>

<p>Unfortunately, it is probably not a surprising that the elderly, especially in America, are not valued as they once were. According to this article, “Our fixation on youth culture has left the elderly out in the cold.”</p>

<p><a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/health/elder/8685589/Our-fixation-on-youth-culture-has-left-the-elderly-out-in-the-cold.html">http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/health/elder/8685589/Our-fixation-on-youth-culture-has-left-the-elderly-out-in-the-cold.html</a></p>

<p>In our quest to for eternal youth, will we forget the lessons and values that come with age and death? Or are we already forgetting? </p>

<p><strong>Sexualizing Children</strong></p>

<p>This is not really <em>new</em>; however, I am more surprised that this part of our society is just swept under the rug. On top of some of the links I have already posted, there is a disturbing trend in the sexualization of children. </p>

<p>1)  Teachers say sexualization of children increasing:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/sep/12/sexualised-behaviour-in-very-young-children-increasing-say-teachers">https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/sep/12/sexualised-behaviour-in-very-young-children-increasing-say-teachers</a></p>

<p>2)  Children are being sexualized in pop culture:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.cnn.com/2011/09/12/opinion/henson-toddlers-tiaras/">http://www.cnn.com/2011/09/12/opinion/henson-toddlers-tiaras/</a></p>

<p>3)  There are countless articles on the increasing sexualization of our youth:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dr-jim-taylor/the-disturbing-sexualization_b_1948451.html">http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dr-jim-taylor/the-disturbing-sexualization_b_1948451.html</a></p>

<p>Disturbingly, at the same time, there seems to be more and more in regards to acceptance of pedophilia. I am not saying that pedophilia is widely accepted yet, but there seems to be a disturbing trend in the “pedophilia is just like any other sexual identity” movement.</p>

<p>Could it be that this movement of treating children as tiny adults could eventually lead to the idea that children can consent to pedophilia? You may think this sounds crazy, but the other day I was downvoted like crazy on Reddit when I said children cannot consent to sex – ever. Are ‘they’ trying to push our views of children, consent, and sexuality to a greyer area here? The murkier the boundaries become between adult and child, the murkier sexual boundaries will likely become. </p>

<p>After all, many believe pedophilia is a sexual identity, not a disorder:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/paedophilia-sexual-orientation-straight-gay-criminal-psychologist-child-sex-abuse-a6965956.html">http://www.independent.co.uk/news/paedophilia-sexual-orientation-straight-gay-criminal-psychologist-child-sex-abuse-a6965956.html</a></p>

<p>Moreover, there are countless examples of the endorsement of pedophilia in pop culture – where the concept of pedophilia is spun in a more positive light. I could probably give thousands of examples of this, but I think a more compelling argument would be to look at YouTube and what it endorses. There are some disturbing channels on YouTube that seem to be “geared” for children…</p>

<p><a href="https://www.romper.com/p/disturbing-content-is-masquerading-as-kids-shows-on-youtube-47212">https://www.romper.com/p/disturbing-content-is-masquerading-as-kids-shows-on-youtube-47212</a></p>

<p>The conspiracy here seems to be invert our views about children, making them seem older, wiser, and capable of adult decisions - that way, eventually, it will be said that all types of love are good, and children are just as capable of consent as they are of anybody of any age. Ever heard of &quot;Heart Progress&quot;?</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>This is a complex post that can go in many directions. Ultimately, I am trying to get readers to see that there seems to be a disturbing shift in the way we treat children today vs. maybe 20 or 30 years ago. </p>

<p>Working with children, I feel that many have lost their youth. They dress more and more sexually provocative at younger ages, and their social media presence often occupies most of their free time. Why does a 11 year old feel the need to post a selfie on Instagram to get hundreds of likes? </p>

<p>A few weeks ago, I made a post about the world feeling &quot;upside down&quot;, and really, this is just an expansion of this post. Every day, I feel like we are forced to believe that this is all just progress, but are we just more desensitized?</p>

<p>As always, it takes me a long time to write these posts, and it is ultimately about discussion. I really would love to hear your thoughts. Please do not downvote me because you disagree. Rather, tell me your thoughts and opinions!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Honestly, I was just talking with my eldest who&#39;s worried about the content my four year old grandson might be accessing on YouTube. It didn&#39;t even seem plausible to her that she could simply take away the devices and let him play with toys or run around in the yard with his dogs. There was desperation and panic in her voice at the thought of cutting off his electronics. This from a child I raised with no television except what I taped for her until the age of ten. She gets the premise, but she feels bound and pressured by her peer group and has been mesmerized by &quot;reality&quot; TV and freaking TedTalks. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is sad, and it drives me nuts! I also have younger kids and I&#39;ve gone to the extent of having a court approved parenting plan that prohibits them from having social media accounts or family posting photos of them on social media until they are 16 unless I give permission. It sounds extreme, I know, but so far the results are positive. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>For one, my little kids have the best manners and are so patient and kind! When they joke, it&#39;s actually funny and thoughtful rather than hurtful and teasing. They play for hours with their train sets, art projects or a walk to the park and don&#39;t seem to get bored. They thrive on ritual, routine, a sense of some organization and understand lessons when they are punished (which is usually a short timeout.) They love to pitch in and &quot;help&quot; with chores. Also, they dig the clothes they find comfortable. None of them seem to care too much about their &quot;look&quot;. I keep them neat and well dressed, but I could put them in potato sacks and I doubt they&#39;d balk.</p>

<p>The downsides are that they are lousy at talking on the phone which drives my mother and eldest daughter nuts. They are also lousy at posing for photos. On our last family get together, my kids looked like heroin addicted emos in every group shot, lol. They are terrible at hamming it up for the camera. </p>

<p>Another downside, they sometimes get a little bullied by more &quot;worldly&quot; kids on the playground, but they bounce back pretty well. </p>

Moves around to different tables trying to get along. She seems to be doing a little better or at least accepting that she doesn&#39;t quite fit in or have a clique.  She doesn&#39;t give up either.  I told her to go eat lunch in the library with the social misfits but she refuses and marches into the cafeteria every day hoping to find her people.  </p>

Just by luck, we met two other families with only children her age, and to this day, the three are inseparable.

Like I mentioned above, she&#39;s weirdly influenced by her peer group, though, like she&#39;s always trying too hard for there acceptance. </p>

<p>WTF is this? Sounds like something out of a dystopian movie.</p>

<p>OP u/polkadotgirl thank tou for your great post. I&#39;ve noticed something else, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s really new, but it&#39;s definitely tied to our contemporary age: the propaganda / subsidized entertainment / culture seems to me to be heavily invested in dissuading people from having children; women are the obvious target of this. Children hamper your career, toddlers are digestive tubes (who only eat &amp; crap), kids are stupid, filthy, unruly and will poison your life, you will become slaves to them, etc. etc. This is part of the general attack on traditional family values of course... but do you think it ties to what you&#39;re saying?</p>

I thought it was only white middle class women, like myself (went to college, grad school, took care of elderly family, worked, payed taxes, luckily got knocked up by accident so I ended up with at least one child unlike most of my friends.). But then I read that African American college educated women have an even lower birth rate.  idiocracy.</p>

<p>The other day I let some of my students use their phones in class. It was the last day of school. They sat there taking selfie after selfie and did not communicate with each other...</p>

<p>This seems bizarre to me; I have to assume that it might have been the &quot;forbidden fruit&quot; and &quot;special treat&quot; aspects of phone use in the classroom.
I have teen/pre-teen children and have also taught in the past. I&#39;ve never seen kids in a group fail to interact so they could take multiple selfies.
I agree that finding balance is key. I believe both adults and children overuse electronic devices in today&#39;s society, and some ppl definitely focus too much on likes from social media posts (or upvotes on Reddit, lol. )
That said, I am glad to see my children and their peer groups all consistently put away the phones when they are together. They play basketball, board games, listen to music... all the things I remember doing as a teen. I find kids today have read the articles, they&#39;ve been taught about internet/gaming addiction and overuse of electronics. They&#39;re actively working to find that balance, too. </p>

But, my kids have learned about overuse of electronics from us (family,) in their school curriculum, and just perusing online - the info is out there in a million different ways.

<p>I don&#39;t know if you&#39;ve seen the wave in pedophilia and pornographic material aimed at children on Youtube, but definitely tell him to keep his kids off of it without direct supervision, watching a family approved channel or series of videos. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VDuBdqIHGM">It is absolutely disturbing and heartbreaking to witness.</a> </p>

<p>I think one of the main takeaways is that we should be wary of the ongoing sexualization of children, which IS real conspiracy. And parents have to show guidance and teach integrity to children and not let them be little adults. It&#39;s a combination of negative intent and just ignorance from adults that have negative consequences for children.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Everything is oversaturated with people&#39;s highlight reels. That&#39;s the problem. When all kids see are the highlights, their standards for their own lives are skewed. They&#39;re fed a narrative through social media, a narrative that they can never seem to fit into no matter how hard they try. They aren&#39;t exposed to the &quot;backstage moments&quot; of all these celebrities they idolize, their assumption is that their life is exactly like their Instagram page, and they want to replicate that. Perfect makeup, perfect lighting, perfect curves, never the same outfit, exotic locations, expensive useless crap 24/7 365 days a year is what these kids are seeing every day, all day on social media. No wonder they have a problem separating that from the reality they live in. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lots of stuff to examine about society, I agree.  Something else that requires a further analysis is the language we use. </p>

<p>The use of certain words in the last 60 or so years especially.  Calling women &#39;baby&#39; is something that always seemed very wrong.  The associations it draws, if only on a subconscious level. </p>

<p>Then you have words and phrase we use to describe children.  Things like little man, little lady.  And the amount of dehumanising synonyms are huge; essentially referring to children as animals eg kid (baby goat), chick, rug rat, little monkey.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve read a lot about it being closer to Jesus&#39;s real teachings <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bogomilism#Doctrine">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bogomilism#Doctrine</a> basically the material world is made of the devil and finding the spiritual is a must to find salvation. It makes me wonder what Jesus really taught at first and how much of what we call christianity has been corrupted over the years all the more because of the Catholic Church taking care of Bogomilism and then being controlled by Judaism today.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>i&#39;m not sure i follow you.</p>

<p>it is true that for genX our books, movies, and tv shows did depict us as the mature, intelligent, and wise and our parents as immature, narcissistic, and foolish, but this was a reflection of reality. our parents were (and still are) literally immature, narcissitic, and foolish. we raised ourselves. this is the one feature of my generation that all generation-ologists agree upon. </p>

<p>i hadn&#39;t seen ET since i saw it in the theater when i was 10, until last summer (it really holds up btw, despite the dated special effects). it was a pay per view option,  and i was like &quot;hey look at that.&quot; watching it as an adult, all i could think was it was all there. that was the most perfect depiction of genX childhood, the little latch key adults, that i ever seen. even the ages of the three kids were the core ages of genX, 1968-1976. somebody was paying attention back then to the generation most accurately called the forgotten one.</p>

<p>however, my interactions with younger people these days, esp current highschool students is that they are very much kids who rely on their parents. this is depicted in current movies about families, even going back to the mid 1990s. parents are always depicted as saving the day. the kids in these movies just need to hang on long enough for daddy to show up. in 1980s movies, the kids are solving all of the problems and the parents are an after though at best or an impediment at worst. </p>

<p>when i was 36, i supervised thre 18 year olds, this was 2006. i loved those kids. they were always saying how they couldn&#39;t believe how old i was and that i was just like them. my response was that we are just a like except they were happy and they liked their parents. until this election cycle, i would still say that about our two generation, but not anymore. i think we are very different now, mostly because they are so neive... like kids (and scarily, like boomers). so, i don&#39;t think kids are forced to grow up to soon these days, i think they are allowed to be young for as long as they want.</p>

<p>you seem to be confusing sexualizing children with treating them as little adults. little adults aren&#39;t sexy, they&#39;re annoying, willful, cagey, cynical...little artful dodgers.  sexualizing children doesn&#39;t work unless the child is simultaneously infantalized cognitively, because the goal isn&#39;t a midget but a toy. </p>

<p>there seemed to have been more sexualizing girls ten years ago then now, back when little five year olds were walking around with &quot;juicy&quot; across their ass. now it seems most girls are dressed like little princesses, sometimes literally. teenage girls have always been exagerating their sexuality as much as they could get away with, but today is mild compared to the teens from the late 70s. </p>

<p>also, an unfortunate thing has happened to fashion sense in america that makes it seem people are sexulizing kids, when it&#39;s just really bad fashion--everyone thinks they look great in leggings and tight shirts. they don&#39;t. it&#39;s not even about being sexy, it&#39;s just really poor self awareness and a lack of anything remotely resembling style. </p>

<p>as for the internet, most of what you describe is just what girls have always done with scrap books, posters, sticker books, passing notes etc. it&#39;s just that now it is writ large. my peoblem is that it makes them targets for predators, but if parents could make a whole generation of kids convinced someone was going to put razor blades in their halloween candy, surely, parents can teach their kids to be internet smart.</p>

<p>fwiw, the age when kids loose their virginity has been steadily rising for at least a decade, and is the highest since the 1950s </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is a really thoughtful reply and I agree with you on pretty much all of your points especially that the GenX kids movies had more self reliant protagonists. However the idea that &quot;--everyone thinks they look great in leggings and tight shirts. they don&#39;t.&quot; hits pretty far off the mark to my mind. 
It might be crazy, but I think everyone (adult everyone) looks good in yoga pants, leggings, tights, with tight shirts. Doesn&#39;t matter if they are overly fat or overly skinny, it just smoothes things out and accentuates the human form so perfectly and makes everyone look better, especially when compared to clothing that covers the bare minimum of skin like Daisy Dukes. Now, the clothes still need to fit properly and people should wear the appropriate size so the fabric doesn&#39;t stretch out funny and become sheer or create unnatural rolls, but otherwise I think they work well.  I will be sad to see them go out of fashion. </p>

<p>I do see your point here. I feel like children are being treated like mini adults in philosophical way. I also think this shift happened more recently...90s and beyond.</p>

<p>I definitely could argue in a different direction when it comes to independence.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Could you expand further on this?</p>

<p>I just cannot agree with you here. I think there is clear evidence that children are being sexualized more than previous generations, and it is not just a matter of self awareness.</p>

<p>Couple years ago... My daughter was telling me a sob story of an outing to a fast food place with her husband and their children...the entire drama played out from <em>her perspective</em>. When she finished this sad sack story I lowered the boom! </p>

<p>Needless to say, my SIL wasn&#39;t happy and I frankly told him I thought he was an ass and while she wanted my sympathy - none was forthcoming as I hadn&#39;t raised her that way!</p>

<p>She had no right to disturb other patrons in that place with her kid acting like a screeching little cretin! It was her job, her responsibility to pick that child up and leave!</p>

<p>She was gob smacked back to reality and while it took a few days she came back to Earth and acknowledged that they talked it over to conclude that they were being stupid.</p>

<p>You&#39;re the adult and they are little replicas - if your an asshat adult then you&#39;ll raise asshat children. Be a good parent and give them a solid foundation!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s an international trend sadly. I was just watching a psychiatrist in Australia speak on complex trauma. She mentioned how girls are being sexualized earlier and earlier, which limits their ability to mature as <em>people</em> due to having these sexualized roles thrust upon them and puts them at higher risk for victimization. Lastly it degrades gender relations as boys and men learn to see all female people as purely sexual beings, rather than seeing the adult females as <em>people</em> with a sexual dimension. </p>

<p>I blame mass media and the porn industry. </p>

And then I&#39;m the asshole because I don&#39;t think that Facebook or social media is that great. There is weird shit everywhere that we are just cool with. The amount of unconscious savagery that goes into just about everything we do is mind boggling. The amount of slavery it took for everything we buy and buy cheap. And adults, fuck. They are just stupid little morons. Not all of them, but there is some seriously moronic people out there, and If think most of it has to do with an attachment to what they think reality is. Taunting anyone who dares step out of what they want out of you. Throwing fits when they don&#39;t get what they want. It&#39;s pathetic, but I don&#39;t know what to do. I handle the weird looks now. People just really don&#39;t want to think about bad shit. Bad shit is uncomfortable. But bad shit is real. And our comforts laid in front of us are our meager acceptance of what this life is. Hopefully I&#39;m not getting to rambly here.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am not on social media.  I call Reddit &quot;Facebook for non-facebookers.&quot;  For some reason, my friends send me constant screen shots of what they see on Facebook.  They are so appalled they have to share.  It is getting worse.  So they are at least somewhat desensitized but I am not.  And it just keeps getting worse.  The shameless bragging, the pathetic 40 + year old women with sexy selfies.  But I worry that I am just isolating and not assimilating which will just keep increasing the divide between me and society.  I honestly cannot understand why ANYONE would be on Facebook or instagram.  My daughter and I tried Instagram until her &quot;friends&quot; posted a picture of a party she wasn&#39;t invited to.  Even she gets it, &quot;instagram just makes you feel bad.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Its funny. I would say our society has gone from treating children like adults to children more like children. </p>

<p>For at least hundreds of years Kids were expected to be seen not heard, expected to act like adults, most holding some form of employment/job at an early age. In the last 80 years, that has shifted to where we are today, kids treated as kids. I would think being your child&#39;s friend means more that you are acting like a child more, not that your child is acting like an adult. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well it&#39;s unintentional by us but we&#39;re given the tools to desensitize our emotions constantly.  </p>

<p>Everything has ramped up and it&#39;s following patterns of history in other places.  </p>

<p>It&#39;s different now though because most of it is self brought through technology.  </p>

<p>Porn is everywhere and it&#39;s leaking into the mainstream fashion culture.  Little is left, if anything, to the imagination anymore.  </p>

<p>The more I notice the more I am repulsed I don&#39;t care how attractive.  It&#39;s a blazing signal of a path followed that leads to chaos. </p>

<p>Movies, words, ads, music, memes, speech, slang, and our ever corrupting idea of the status quo all contribute to our self degradation and journey into smut.  </p>

<p>The denial is the worst part.  Any person can compare fashion alone to even 30 years ago and objectively see an exponential difference in sexuality and the age at which it&#39;s trendy. Younger and younger and I believe it&#39;s because those in control want the paternal power over society.  </p>

<p>If all men are sexually confused and de-masculated through their own implanted fetishes through technology worldwide, who will be willing to stand up and resist? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great post. Going to be so I&#39;ll keep it light. My parents raised me well. They didn&#39;t discipline me too much but it was because I was a decent kid. But when they did, I knew why, I knew what to do, what not to do, and my butt was a bit sore to remind me. </p>

<p>My mom taught me a lot too. She used to beat my butt all the time in candy land but taught me how to win with grace (still not good at it though lol). They gave me responsibility but didn&#39;t go out and blow money after my stupid decisions. If I flooded the sandbox, I had to deal with it. They let me eat dirt but told me I was stupid to do it lol. </p>

<p>To touch on other points, they didn&#39;t sexualize anything in my life. There&#39;s no need for a kid to be deciding their gender at 5 years old. Just crazy stuff these days. </p>

<p>Sorry this turned into a long unrelated post but I had been thinking about my parents as it is my birthday today. Thanks for your post. Cheers</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it depends on where you live. There are large differences in behavior of people depending on locality, and location can reflect significant class divides. Lower class people/regions tend to have more of the behaviors you describe. Class is a very significant divider and determines a lot of habits.</p>

<p>My observation is simply that popular media (primarily television), promotes the things you describe, and lower class people simply consume more of said media. Monkey see and monkey do, and because said lower class people consume a lot of said media, they replicate what they see in their behavior, and it simply propagates. Middle and upper class people have access to more resources so their children (generally) consume somewhat less of such media and exhibit fewer of those behaviors.</p>

<p>tl;dr, it&#39;s not a widespread thing. It&#39;s just another example of a widening wealth/culture divide.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think that you raised a lot of good arguments that we are headed in a direction that 10 or 20 years ago would have been considered outrageous and rightfully so.</p>

<p>This is <em>progress</em>. I think I am beginning to appreciate my grandparents and parents longing for &quot;the good ol&#39; days.&quot;</p>

<p>I agree with your argument that children are being sexualized more today than they were 10-20 years ago. It&#39;s been normalized by the media for decades. We are being fed filth in television, movies, magazines, apps, games, advertising, billboards, music, the Internet, websites, forums, chat rooms, instant messaging, social media, facebook, tinder... it&#39;s a little overwhelming isn&#39;t it? Now I&#39;m not saying there isn&#39;t good information out there. But if you are a inexperienced, naive kid who doesn&#39;t know any better its really easy to find yourself in places you probably shouldn&#39;t be. The mind is a fragile thing and it&#39;s really like putty during the first formative years. It is molded by what it is exposed to. Think about some of the stuff you&#39;ve seen on the internet.</p>

<p>Think about the amount of information and garbage we consume today compared to 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 years ago. Its ridiculous to think about really. In the 70s I remember hearing stories about how people dreaded to be put through someone&#39;s slideshow of their vacation in Hawaii. But now, we gobble that shit up like we can&#39;t get enough. And we try to shove it down everyone else&#39;s throats too.</p>

<p>It is the relaxing of society&#39;s morals in order to further someone&#39;s agenda. Someone mislabeled as the left or the right so we&#39;d have some bogeyman to fight instead of the real problem.</p>

<p>I do think that this is happening so that pedophilia will become accepted. I think that is disgusting and I will not be complicit in letting that happen to my home.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think we will see them try to coopt the LGBT movement and attach themselves to it. Keep in mind I am all for gay rights and transgender rights but the difference in that and pedophilia is age of consent.</p>

<p>We will (and already are) hearing the arguments that the age of consent was 14, 12, or even lower in ancient times and that our age of consent is just a social limitation that we are imposing on other people against their rights. That is bullshit. </p>

<p>The difference now versus then is now we have done countless studies that show that our brains are still developing and before you reach a certain age your mind is not at the point where it is capable of understanding the consequences of your actions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have been exploring a lot of new age writings and belief systems lately and I could easily see this being true. A lot of ascension teachings push the idea that everything comes from one source and that we are all the same being. Me and you are one and the same. There are parts of this I agree with, and parts I don&#39;t. But I do think that this message could easily be twisted to evil purposes. The advancement of a pedophilia agenda being one of them.</p>

<p>Check out this post of alleged &quot;channelings&quot; of higher 5th dimensional beings from a site called ancientawakenings.org</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And as I have said many times, I am here with this group, I am here with many of you. Many of you that are in the awakening process. Many of you that have awakened to who you are, to begin to remember fully what you are here for. And as you are continuing with this program, with this process that you are going through, that we are helping you move through, you are going to come to an understanding not only of who you are but what you are here to do, what you came to do, the mission that you came here for. And that mission is going to be introduced to you more and more and more as these days and weeks and even months go by. You are going to come more and more to understand the meaning that you are here for; what you came to do here.</p>

<p>And as you come to this meaning, as you come to this understanding, you will realize that you are the One. You are THE ONE. Meaning that you are one with the God Source within you and within all beings; within all creation.</p>

<p>We are all ONE together. And we have always been one, there’s never been a time when we were disconnected. Only in the mind are you disconnected but never in reality are you. There is always that connection, always that sense of belonging that has always been with you, always will be with you.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This type of teaching is a little troubling to me. It is capitalizing on some people&#39;s newfound expansion of knowledge and I think some of these organizations are trying to promote their own agendas using people who are only seeking truth. They are pushing a message that will resonate with a lot of people. Unfortunately while I think there are nuggets of truth in all of these teachings, I think the vast majority of them are charlatans.</p>

<p>I have a post myself where I discuss some of my ideas about the possibility of a multi-dimensional reality. I would love if you had the chance to read and give your thoughts later.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I actually read your flatland thing yesterday and shared it! Amazing thoughts!</p>

<p>I also think there is a lot of &quot;one&quot; propaganda going on right now.</p>

<p>This is a little off topic but I feel like maybe the concept of false religion is this:</p>

<p>1) We are all one and connected as one soul</p>

<p>Or </p>

<p>2) We are all empty and should detach from our egos.</p>

<p>I took the Buddhist path for a while, and I started to grow tired of the detachment.</p>

<p>I do not think we can detach from life, our egos. We need to learn to use our egos in the most advantageous ways to help others and the world.</p>

<p>I really can clarify this more and I wrote a post about it if you are interested!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would be interested in reading it. I think that all religions ultimately have the details wrong, but there are truths of the big picture littered throughout all of them. I am making my way through them now in my research. Albeit only as a hobby, though I have started compiling my thoughts for a possible book one day, not necessarily to publish but for my sake.</p>

<p>I love a lot of the Buddhist ideas, but I am still studying it so my arguments aren&#39;t fully developed. I do think that life is suffering and that one of its purposes is to help mold us into beings who can empathize with other&#39;s suffering in order to minimize suffering (possibly this is the idea of ascension). Although, that in itself seems like a catch-22. If there was no suffering then there would be no need for empathy right? We would all live in a utopia. Here I think is the rub. With the existence of knowledge, there is no such thing as a utopia. There can&#39;t be. A utopia would be ignorance of pain and suffering. It would have to be engineered ignorance because you can&#39;t naturally forget what pain and suffering are. This means the utopia would have to have a controller, which I think disqualifies it from being a utopia.</p>

<p>The knowledge of good and evil shatters the idea of a utopia and peace love and harmony. You can&#39;t banish that knowledge once it is revealed. If utopia is ignorance, then knowledge would have to be evil. And I don&#39;t believe that to be the case.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey, it&#39;s me.  :)</p>

<p>Before Adam and Eve ate the fruit of knowledge of good and evil, I believe the garden of Eden was a utopia.  I just got back from my sister&#39;s ballroom dancing event with other children with disabilities.  Most of them do not consciously know of evil and they are the happiest and the purest of heart people that I know.  :)</p>

<p>I think knowledge of good and evil has led us to this corrupt material world we are in now.  I wish the world was like it was back in Eden.  When one rejects it because it was too simple of a life, I think, whether they know it or not, they are siding with Lucifer over God.</p>

<p>I used to be very interested in the oneness stuff.  Now, I think it is actually what the illuminati/Luciferians believe in: there is no creator God and through one&#39;s works, reincarnating, choosing their race and situation they are born into, they work off their karmic debt until they become one with the source/&quot;Great Architect of the Universe&quot;.  Pretty much what that high level insider person said.</p>

<p>In the Law of One, the channeled entity is named Ra; the god of the sun in Egyptian mythology.  In the mysteries, the sun represents knowledge and the &quot;god&quot; of knowledge being Lucifer.  One must be very careful in my opinion about disinformation directly from the illuminati.  It will be some of the most convincing disinformation because they sold their soul for knowledge and have knowledge passed down for millennia from Lucifer.</p>

<p>I wish I had more compassion than I do.  My soul has been tainted by evil.  I think too logically and have been exposed to evil when what really matters more is what is good and what is evil.</p>

<p>The people who are cruel to those with disabilities are in a way, in support of one of the illuminati&#39;s doctrines: those who are not illuminated are cattle.  If only they looked at it from an ethical or philosophical standpoint...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I read 2/3 of this because you&#39;re too wordy and your writing carries an arrogant tone. But I&#39;m no expert in rhetoric. Just letting you know I only read most of your post.</p>

<p>I like how you think on these issues, in general. I&#39;m very disturbed by trends that sexualize girls, dissolve the parent to child divide, and sell the idea that adults should seek to remain youthful. </p>

<p>Children deserve to have time to grow up and form their personalities. </p>

<p>The parent who seeks to be their child&#39;s friend is truly harming the child with a permissive parenting style. </p>

<p>Parents who live vicariously through their children are sick. It&#39;s a form of narcissism. And again, it harms the child.  Don&#39;t get me started on the depravity that is cosmetic surgery. Youth must be allowed to pass. Let it go. Be an adult! </p>

<p>Age, maturity, and growth are things to venerate. We should protect children from the demands of neurotic adults as they navigate the path to adulthood (but not obsess over youth). </p>

<p>One critique of your argument, though: humans come to have a  awareness of their gender at around age three or four. It happens whether the child is trans or not. This is normal in the developmental psychology of humans. If you&#39;re not aware of your gender at this age, something is off.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Honestly, I am inclined to think that we learn most of our lessons from our mistakes once we are hit by the consequences. In other words, things go in cycles and the next time around, perhaps we&#39;ll do things better. While people have their bread and circus, as the majority currently do, there is little to do to persuade them to think differently. </p>

<p>It&#39;s much like architecture - if you discover a fundamental flaw in a building once its built and lived-in, you have two clear choices: 1) destroy the building and start again (but nobody wants to leave their cozy room) 2) wait for the building to fall down (and probably deny there is a problem while doing so). Thankfully we have laws and strict surveying procedures that ensure this doesn&#39;t happen with buildings, but we don&#39;t have quite the same experience with sociology etc. and the process has developed organically.</p>

<p>As far as I can see, the basic foundation of several aspects of our society is based on flawed behaviour that will lead to an irreversible catastrophe, unless the majority became aware of it and choose to prevent it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have a middle school daughter.  Pretty.  Great athlete.  Very nice.  No school friends.  I am her best friend.  I see parents who cling to their children.  I want mine to find a best friend.  Instead, she is rejected.  I can&#39;t figure it out.  She has no real Interest in social media, doesnt bother with her phone.  I think she doesn&#39;t put in the work.  These girls spend hours on their phones, all day and night.  My child would rather watch tv or play with the dog.  She doesn&#39;t know why she isn&#39;t invited to parties and sleepovers.  I ask coaches and teachers what they see.  Nothing.  They see nothing.  She is socially appropriate and looks like she is having fun.  She doesn&#39;t gossip.  She isn&#39;t mean.  So what do I do?  I continue to arrange play dates with friends from other schools.  I continue to take her to activities.  But I am also her companion because I can&#39;t bear to leave her all alone.  I worry that she is not making normal bonds because she is so attached to me.  We have no family and her survival depends on her starting her own.  So I don&#39;t sleep.  </p>

<p>No sense of community.  No kids playing outside. No cousins.  Nothing.  I schedule trips and camps with others.  Trying to teach her to bond and get along.  She has a wonderful time.  Everything is perfect.  But then she goes to school or activities and the cool kids push her out.  She is very pretty, people stop me to tell me.  I buy her the right clothes.  She doesn&#39;t smell.  </p>

<p>Teachers and coaches tell me to be grateful she isn&#39;t like the rest.  They are loud, bad, inappropriate.  But at her age my friends mattered more than my family.  But I had a broken home.  It is so much harder than I expected.  When I was her age, my parents had checked out.  My mother had left even.  I am a 24 hour a day mother and friend to a middle schooler.  I don&#39;t understand.</p>

<p>The kids we do spend time with have the same story.  I find them on a regular basis. Perfectly normal kids who are left out.  </p>

<p>Could it be that kids who have parental attention do not need social media acceptance?  The kids who come over seem to crave my attention.  When my village plans activities the kids are happiest when we are involved.  The kids go off on their own, but are happy we are close by and somewhat involved.  The cool kids go to the mall together without parents.  Mine goes with me.</p>

<p>I have had 1 student like yours. Exactly as you mentioned. I talked to her and told her she might not always fit in because she is nice and unlike the other girls. I told her mom this and she agreed. I know we cannot have favorites, but she was one of my favorites.</p>

<p>I definitely think social media is all about self validation. My parents dif not get me the proper attention I needed so I sought validation elsewhere (men and sex).</p>

<p>Working with children, I feel that many have lost their youth. They dress more and more sexually provocative at younger ages, and their social media presence often occupies most of their free time. Why does a 11 year old feel the need to post a selfie on Instagram to get hundreds of likes? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Have a look at those who have terms like &quot;early childhood development&quot; in their CV. This is clearly an agenda. I agree completely with your conclusions. Excellent efforts here! More and more parents allow other forces to guide their children. I have a 5yo niece and 3yo nephew who are not yet at the age where they are involved on social media, but it is obvious based on their attraction to MSM animation, cartoons, songs etc, that without profound efforts by parents, the impressionable minds of our youth are being bombarded by imagery and symbols that have a known outcome.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey, it&#39;s me again.  :)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>many teachers oppose Roald Dahl books such as Matilda or Charlie and the Chocolate Factory because they paint adults as evil and unwise and children as innocent and wise.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Interesting.  Part of this idea would be that it teaches kids to not obey their parents because the kids know better.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>More and more, parents fear disciplining children for a variety of reasons. Some want to be their children’s friends, some fear upsetting children, and some feel that children do not need the guidance of adults to learn lessons.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I totally agree.  Many of them want to do what they think their parents did wrong which often means letting the kids loose more and more each generation.</p>

<p>That and the parents don&#39;t have the energy or desire to discipline them to teach a lesson.  They would rather be entertained themselves.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why is it that many parents are having more difficulty separating themselves from their children?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think it is partly because the parents and children entertain themselves in similar ways.  Kids and parents are using social media.  It goes back to what you are saying.  Kids doing things that adults do at earlier and earlier ages.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Not only does there appear to be a problem in parents creating boundaries</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Many parents don&#39;t realize that these boundaries need to be made early on.  The earlier the better I think.  As kids get older, they tend to disobey more and more.  Especially when puberty hits.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>More and more reality shows are based on children in extremely adult roles</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This and kids are exposed to pop culture at an earlier age.  The likes of Katy Perry are role models for young girls.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Kids are actually facing addiction to technology.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I can identify with this personally.  I was addicted to video games and, later, the internet starting when I was really young (6 or 7).  It is an endorphin rush and habits can become an addiction depending on your personality.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>the term “teenager” is fairly modern</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I never gave it thought but you are right.  This relatively new idea of a teenager can have a major impact on society considering it is roughly 10% of the population.  It also impacts one&#39;s life after being a teenager.</p>

<p>Regarding an adult&#39;s desire to stay young, being young is considered sexier, college students and younger usually have more free time than adults, and younger versions of oneself usually had more energy and better health.  Many people are &quot;glass half empty&quot; (I am myself.) as well often because they have difficult lives (My life is not difficult.).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Does there seem to be some type of inversion or flip of our childhood/adulthood schemas?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I gave this some thought and I think it is more of a blending of the two.  Kids look up to younger celebrities and pop stars.  Once the kids are the same age, many are still well liked.  For women over 30 or something like that, many want to be like the famous actresses they are now older than.  My dad&#39;s girlfriend&#39;s daughter says, &quot;Just kill me now.&quot; when thinking about being 30.  She doesn&#39;t want to have kids.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Have we arrived at a point in our society where we fear to examine the moral necessity of death or aging?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think it is that people don&#39;t think about these sorts of things because they are caught up in their lives, habits, and addictions.  You don&#39;t get an endorphin rush out of pondering these sorts of things.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Our fixation on youth culture has left the elderly out in the cold.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is really sad to me when I think about my grandparents who have passed.  All four of them were excellent role models.  I&#39;ll admit that I should have spent more time with them but I was too caught up in whatever addiction I had at the time.  Especially with the current elderly generation, their &quot;world&quot; is much different from ours.  There are less common interests.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Could it be that this movement of treating children as tiny adults could eventually lead to the idea that children can consent to pedophilia?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It seems to be heading in that direction.  At the very least, it means kids will have sex at even younger ages.  Kids of a certain age or younger are not responsible or educated enough to avoid preganacy.  Or if girls get preganant, it is perfectly fine to have an abortion /s.</p>

<p>Excellent post as always.  :)  It seems to have really struck a cord with some of the people in the comments.  That shows that you are making a difference!  :)  I hope you realize that your perspective as a female middle grade teacher is really unique and insightful here.  Many of us don&#39;t have a good idea of what today&#39;s culture is like for kids of that age.</p>

<p>We will (and already are) hearing the arguments that the age of consent was 14, 12, or even lower in ancient times and that our age of consent is just a social limitation that we are imposing on other people against their rights. That is bullshit. </p>
