       Fotoforensics doesn't indicate that they've been altered, neither does imageedit.

       regardless, you're claiming they're "obviously photoshopped". What makes it obvious to you? The pixels? your claim, your burden of proof.

       One were are these supposed photoshoped pictures, I would like to see them as I have spent a lot of time using Photoshop and have learned some tricks on how to pick out a Photoshop picture within reason.
      </p>
      <p>
       Two if your anti trump why are you on T_D, I got banned from their in one comment that wasn't even anti trump, but you have multiple posts, HOW can anyone that thinks he should be locked up not get banned from their after the first post.
      </p>
      <p>
       Third you sure seem to have a lot of time on your hands posting on this sub a lot, maybe its time to get a hobby if your spending a lot of time here, just a suggestion unless you have some other reason to spend a lot of time on this sub.

       My grammar is a lot better than it was in high school. When I was in high school for an essay there would be tons of mistakes in each paragraph. Now I am in university and my English grades are good, something like 10% better than my grade 12 final grade.

       The post was there. I saw it. You can believe me or not believe me, whatever.
      </p>

       However, you're still all being taken for a ride and it's pretty obvious to me.
      </p>
      <p>
       The guy is a troll who's trying to pose as a pro-Trumper who's posing as an anti-Trumper. He "accidentally" posted a PM as a text post on this sub, despise saying in the first line that he almost accidentally did it. Have you ever sent a PM? This is very very difficult to do accidentally. Try it.
      </p>

       How the fuck are people falling for this? I thought this community could actually think.

       If you were to ask if people ever landed on the moon, some people would agree to all three of these answers: "No, it's not possible." "Yes, the nazzis." and "No, because moon doesn't
       <em>
        really
       </em>
       exist."
      </p>
      <p>
       It's because these people treat conspiracy like paranoia. "Don't know what, don't know where, but somethings wrong and all over here."
      </p>
      <p>
       So they'll upvote even this stupid little theater play going on here.

       heres how science works
      </p>
      <p>
       you make a claim, such as that you have done an experiment on the moon where you drop a hammer and a feather at the same time, to see if they hit the ground at the same time.
      </p>
      <p>
       then, other people try to replicate your experiment, as per the scientific method.
      </p>
      <p>
       when, after 50 years of nobody being able to replicate your experiment, your experiment is finally dismissed as the garbage that it always was.

       They covered a whole lot in school, no worries.
      </p>
      <p>
       And they proved nothing new on the moon. Nothing, that we would need to "repeat" to prove. All the concepts
       <em>
        demonstrated
       </em>
       not "proved" there can be demonstrated in most space stations. Show me a concept that they "proved" on the Moon that the ruskies have disproved. Or haven't been able to reproduce.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, as I clearly went to school, peep this - other way how science works. A chap comes out with a theory. Other chaps look at the theory and points out flaws. In some threads even 249 chaps.

      <p>
       i read all of the comments, and replied to all of them
      </p>
      <p>
       individually, each comment is just another idiots opinion, just like OP's opinion.
      </p>
      <p>
       and collectively they do not "debunk" OP. they had their opportunity to show where the problems were, and there were some problems, such as a disagreement over the relative mass of the Earth to the Moon.
      </p>
      <p>
       OP says the mass is 1:6 whereas the peers claim the mass is 1:100
      </p>
      <p>
       so, regardless if the mass is 1/6 or 1/100th, the underlying story-problems remain, but just have to be reconfigured for which-ever mass ratio you
       <em>
        feel
       </em>
       is correct.
      </p>
      <p>
       so, Let Earth to Moon mass ratio be 1/100 instead of 1/6, and now we have moved the Lagrange Point farther from Earth and closer to the Moon, which means the mass of the astronauts and their support gear had to go that much farther from Earth to reach a Lagrange Point. it could be argued that if the Earth:Moon mass was only 1/100, then the moon landing would have been that much harder. why? because the astronaut and his gear will be gaining
       <em>
        Gravitational Potential Energy
       </em>
       every mm of the way from Earth to the Lagrange Point. as we all know, by the Law of Conservation of Energy, that astronauts cannot gain Potential Energy without inputting and/or converting kinetic energy, and vice versa
      </p>
      <p>
       so, there are some points of contention, and i appreciate the feedback, as it helps me sharpen my understanding and helps me articulate my thoughts more precisely

       I clicked on your username and it's there in your comment history, which I still have open in another tab that hasn't been refreshed since you deleted the post after I made this comment.

      <p>
       This is such a poor attempt at trolling that I'm starting to worry this isn't trolling at all, but is somehow the reality you're actually struggling with.
      </p>
      <p>
       In fact, I'm tagging you in RES as "Trump supporter that meant to send a PM but accidentally posted it as a submission to
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       , outing themselves as being paid to go on reddit and pretend to dislike Trump (while making lots of typos so as to discredit anti-Trump people), then subsequently deleted the post before asking in
       <a href="/r/askreddit">
        /r/askreddit

       whether mods can see posts that have already been deleted"

       heres how science works
      </p>
      <p>
       you make a claim, such as that you have done an experiment on the moon where you drop a hammer and a feather at the same time, to see if they hit the ground at the same time.
      </p>
      <p>
       then, other people try to replicate your experiment, as per the scientific method.
      </p>
      <p>
       when, after 50 years of nobody being able to replicate your experiment, your experiment is finally dismissed as the garbage that it always was.
