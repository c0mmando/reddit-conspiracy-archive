       I wish I saved it when I saw it a day ago. I know he mentioned twitter is deleting some of his tweets or maybe he himself deleted it. Not sure but I saw it there in the last 24 hours for sure and I believe this insider to be real. Also, I made a post about it once I saw it here:

       I'm not saying every conspiracy claim ever made is correct. But maybe its time to start believing the victims. You know, since SO MUCH of it, even the ridiculous parts, turned out to be true.

       I'm not saying every conspiracy theory is wrong. If I have proof of what he says, I will believe him. I'm glad when someone can change my mind and learn me something. But in the case of this guy, he hasn't even shared proof or links like you have (I haven't looked at them yet, but I will now, thanks for the suggestion :) ).

       Why would this be an issue, I get it you're looking at the costs, but in war sometimes you get your ride shot out from under you. Pilots are/were also expensive to train and there are never enough of them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just remember this the American war machine is always pushing forward regardless of the costs, a pilot losing his plane is just another bump in the budget.

       I've posted on this before.  But it's kinda silly to equate the jesuits with the freemasons.  Centuries of fighting between the two.  The Jesuits were established in large part to fight the rise of freemasonry in England, which encouraged the crown to become independent of Rome.  But the freemasons won then and they've kept winning, infiltrating the church to the point of almost destroying it.  Important to note that the current pope, a jesuit, is fiercely opposed to the current US president,

       You're mixing up a lot of complex factions here. Grand Orient Freemasonry fought the Church a lot, and directly fought the Jesuits.

      <p>
       Grand Lodge not as much. And these days, they are all dark occultists trying to protect the power of the elites.

       They were created in response to the Reformation. Now, that may have had some Rosicrucian involvement, but the Grand Lodge system wasn't to be invented for 150 years.

       So... since we both acknowledge that there isn't just Team GoodGuys vs Team BadGuys, and there are many different factions and allegiances, the truth is that
       <em>
        we're witnessing a civil war between factions inside TPTB
       </em>
       .  Hard to say that Trump isn't a freemason, or a wannabe freemason (probably even worse.)  Gingrich, who you believe is a freemason, took trump's side rather vehemently.  He said he hadn't performed the "initiation," but he was still on Trump's side.  So, by that logic, even if he's not a freemason, I think he's doing the freemasons' bidding.  Or at least one sect of them.  The crazy bastards over on the other side of the country in Bohemian Grove were none too thrilled about this.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Jesuits are an entirely different faction of a different set, whose interests may occasionally align (ww2, for instance).

       This is all guessing and repeating what you've heard. What concrete facts can you point to indicating a "civil war between factions"? There's some normal infighting and a lot of CIA operatives telling you there is a civil war, but where's the evidence?

       This one in particular seems ludicrous, if you are going to rape, murder, and cannibalize people, why the hell would you involve McDonalds? The easiest way to keep a secret, is to limit the people who know it, involving more people arbitrarily makes almost no sense.

       They make extra sheckles when they send the dead bodies to their own slaughterhouses and sell the meat to corporations like McDonald's. Rabbi Finkelstein is the one who mentioned it because he believes the Zionists have already conquered the planet and he doesn't give a shit about secrets anymore:

       So, this is pretty weak in so far as evidence. If this is all you are basing your claim on, you might want to do a bit more research.

       You might be one of those who will only look at "smoking gun evidence" instead of looking at the big picture. If you want to be a real investigator, you have to use your inner sense of knowing by utilizing all evidence instead of just smoking gun evidence. I have personally researched tens of thousands of pages worth of conspiracy material and so I can't post all of it in one place but I am dropping a few tid bits. Whether you believe or not is your personal choice just as it is with everyone.

       This is the conspiracy sub mate, I'm not just going to take your word for it. You made a call for action, put up (the evidence) or shut up as far as I'm concerned. If you have the evidence for these claims, I'll be the first to make the call, but if not then don't try to urge gullible people to do something on trumped up claims.
