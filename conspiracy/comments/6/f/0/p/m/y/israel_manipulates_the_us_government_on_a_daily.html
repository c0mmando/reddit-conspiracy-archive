    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been preaching this since a little bit after this whole Russian narrative started. It&#39;s nothing more than misdirection. There are <em>so many</em> politicians in our govt that are openly paid by Israel. And paid good amounts. Israel has invaded our govt from top to bottom. But nobody knows because they keep creating scandal after scandal, misdirection over and over again. Keep us focused on other shit. I really don&#39;t have hope anymore. This country is ridiculous. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think it&#39;s fair to make that blanket statement that we are idiots and deserve it. We always gotta remember, they created this system that keeps us as idiots. We are to no small degree victims of this thing that keeps everyone asleep, distracted, and misinformed. Sure, we all participate in it, but it&#39;s not like we were given choices, and chose the wrong thing. The illusion of choice is one of the primary components of this thing.</p>

<p>And people that hang around here and can see around the edges, well there are some cultural penalties for that. It is not appealing to the average joe sixpack to participate in our reality and be subject to ridicule.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s call it what it is, the most successful mindfuck of all time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>knowing y&#39;all are being duped and choosing passivity over making decisions and choices to break out of their iron grip is an enabler of keeping this system alive and well.</p>

<p>choice isn&#39;t an illusion; the real illusion is that &quot;you don&#39;t have a choice&quot;, and as long as you think you don&#39;t, you give way for this system to thrive.</p>

<p>the system will crumble in seconds if we all realised that we have a choice to make things right, to educate those around us, to unlearn pacifying and self-destructive behaviour.</p>

<p>money makes all of this possible. just one day, one day of no money influx is enough to topple their disgusting asses.</p>

<p>but people are too scared and cowardly to give up their fake security and comfort, to get the real one that all of us can achieve.</p>

<p>we let ourselves be mindfucked.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>i agree. i am very much anti war and killing of any kind, however much a person has done wrong. but everyone is not me, and i have no idea how you could make a move for the better and dealing with earth&#39;s population of billions, some of which all they know is violence, without shedding innocent and guilty blood alike.</p>

<p>i wish it weren&#39;t so, and there&#39;s no easy solution. but sometimes you have to think realistically.</p>

<p>could we shut down isis without them taking a few hundred, if not thousands, of innocents down with them so they escape punishment and what not? what are they even fighting for? they have so much conviction in what they fight for. it just won&#39;t be easy.</p>

<p>and the elite have it 10 times over. we can&#39;t delude ourselves into thinking that we can fight back by singing songs of peace and showing them the light when they&#39;ve demonstrated time and time again that they just don&#39;t give a single fuck about human life.</p>

<p>i don&#39;t believe in killing. but goddamn it if someone came at me with intent to kill i&#39;d do whatever i could to survive. kill my attacker? i don&#39;t know. you just don&#39;t know what you&#39;d do unless you&#39;re put in that very situation.</p>

<p>choice isn&#39;t an illusion; the real illusion is that &quot;you don&#39;t have a choice&quot;, and as long as you think you don&#39;t, you give way for this system to thrive.</p>

<p>Well said. I think we are on the forefront of this much needed change. If it weren&#39;t for the internet and this sub specifically, I&#39;d probably still be asleep at the wheel. We can change the world by sharing ideas on how to make the world a better place, and to show people how we&#39;re being deceived. Once enough people are awakened to the deception, the 100th monkey effect will take place. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What we do now compared to what the 20 year olds did in the 70s in protest of vietnam makes a strong case for us being idiots. It&#39;s not only that we have more information on the crimes our government is committing now yet are somehow less informed, but that this doesn&#39;t even register for the average millennial as they are too busy cosplaying as civil rights activists/suffragettes because the media--at the request of the government--throws fuel on subsided fires to keep us distracted from the issues that matter.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t really like or trust all the disparaging ideas about millennials. I&#39;m not of that generation, and my personal experience actually closely resembles the meme about the uselessness and banality  of their subculture, or whatever you.want to call it. </p>

<p>But I don&#39;t trust it, I feel like this idea is forced, and that the squeeky wheels of their generation have been made to stick out so we over-generalize and dismiss them as a group. If the millenials are as fucking retarded as we have been made to believe we are well and truly screwed. </p>

<p>I choose to hope the majority of them are quiet and thoughtful, and as they mature into influence we are going to be surprised. I wonder if the campaign to convince everyone of how useless they are is just because they are so radically different in how they engage in culture, that tptb fear them for some reason. This is going to be the first group of kids that practically don&#39;t know what a cable subscription is, and definitely don&#39;t take tv seriously.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Like I said dude imagine that every time a black person complained about not getting a job you assumed it was because of racism or whenever obama told you something about yemen you believed it but immediately rebuked it when trump said and did the exact same things. Imagine if choosing to become a preschool teacher and then finding out that it pays shit was because of the patriarchy or the wage gap. That&#39;s the type of people you&#39;re dealing with here. The best case scenario is someone who works all day and ignores social issues in their leisure time or a first generation immigrant who knows their peers are full of shit because yes most millennials are full of shit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m in the age group considered as millennials (mid 20s) but I refuse to label myself as one because most of them really are as stupid as they&#39;re made out to be and care about nothing other than their social media profiles and bull shit calls for social justice that get them likes, retweets, and lots of random followers that they don&#39;t know and probably will never know. I hate my generation for being so apathetic and complacent but I&#39;m starting to accept that their not wholly responsible for their shittiness. I see more now that they are the product, the end result of TPTB plan and most don&#39;t know any different because they were never taught different. A lot of them who we view as SJW do have good intentions and they think they&#39;re helping to further the cause of humanity but they lack critical thinking skills and don&#39;t comprehend logic because most were never really taught those tools... they don&#39;t question narratives of the media or their government as a whole... they follow the scents of the bait traps laid by MSM and get riled up about nonsensical stories and the false reality of the entertainment world. They care more about famous people that they will never meet than they do about their neighbors and the people they actually interact with in their every day lives. They&#39;re disconnected from Mother Earth and plugged into the technological world which destroys our ideas of humanity, dignity, respect and communication every day. </p>

<p>Not all millennials are like this, but the majority are and for the others who are like me, it&#39;s getting more and more frustrating by the day. I try so hard to have conversations about the things we talk about here and shit that&#39;s not the typical narrative being pushed in MSM, social media etc. but RARELY can I ever get people to actually engage and converse with me, even if they disagree. As soon as I start talking, a blank stare tends to fall over their faces and I can see that they&#39;re not listening anymore. What I have to say is considered boring or conspiracy theories so it&#39;s not taken as seriously as say, what someone like Meryl Streep or some other entertainer might have to say.</p>

<p>I am not without compassion, but I firmly believe that the victim mentality is counterproductive. Its tends to absolve individuals of their personal responsibility to resist that which is unjust, as well as convince them that they have no power to affect positive change. </p>

<p>A prisoner maybe, but never a victim. Not while I still have a pulse and the means to resist.</p>
