       typical play by the monarchy class - get someone else to do the work for you.  find them, groom them, otherwise arrange circumstances.  do this on scale.  use the police and the court systems to keep the juggling act up until you need them.  that setup of 2 hapless druggies into "terrorists" by the RCMP is classic playbook by this crowd.

       It's possible that the attackers were groomed.
      </p>
      <p>
       The underlying issue I see is the justification of the ever increasing
       <a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/even-with-increased-surveillance-there-is-more-of-this-to-come">
        surveillance state
       </a>
       despite it's failings:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Following each incident, this year the government has called for increased online surveillance, despite the UK already having some of the widest-ranging surveillance powers of any democratic state.
       </p>
       <p>
        A survey immediately after the Manchester attack saw 68 percent of respondents backing wider state powers to intercept encrypted messaging services like WhatsApp and Telegram ...  it is as yet unclear what, if anything, such powers could have done to prevent any of the incidents this year, with MI5 currently undertaking inquiries into both the Westminster and Manchester attacks.

       Yeah but they've been doing this the whole time.  leaks re: public surveillance have gone on since at least the 70s.  Watergate, the Church commission, all the way to the 90s and keyhole, echelon, to sony rootkits, 5 eyes, xbox room scanning, cell phone autosuggestion.  Fuck.  This is old news.  The policy side has been trying to catch up to the tech side the whole time, and that's what we've seen post 9-11 in America.  Hell, you could make an argument the first twin tower bombings, Ruby Ridge, Waco and the Murrah Building were all attempts to trigger policy changes.  Shit is old news bro.

       TPTB ran a narrative through the lens of the fourth-estate about 2 months back concerning the normalization of the CIA, NSA and Deep State's spying powers that sounded remarkably similar:

       It's great that the police and MI5 knew who the assailants were ahead of time. Now they just have to figure out the next thing they have to do to prevent attacks. Hmm....
