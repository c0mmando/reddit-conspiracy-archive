       Remember the dude that predicted that Fresno Police would kill him, and was found dead stabbed in the abdomen with his house set ablaze.
      </p>

       Video of people outside his home:

      <p>
       His death was ruled a suicide by Fresno police.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: This story never got the appropriate coverage because of the election, we should revisit this. He uploaded suspicious activity captured by his surveillance camera on his youtube channel:
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTMl9Ncxd-jhZ81s4z3XA6w/videos">

       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       I noticed a lot of people are uninformed so here's a background story:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://shockerfeed.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/johnlang.jpg">
        John Lang made a prediction days before his death and insisted if he died the Fresno police would be accountable on facebook.
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       He discovered a license plate scanning scam where Fresno police would scan license plates at retail store parking lots of lower income neighborhoods. After getting hits of violations they would pull the drivers over blocks away and claim they came upon their vehicle through routine driving patrols. He reported this illegal activity to Fresno Bee reporter. Since exposing the Fresno Law Enforcement, he noticed that he began to become a target and was being constantly stalked and harassed by Law Enforcement. He felt his chat logs were directed to Fresno Law Enforcement to garnish more information. His life threatenend, he filed an investigation to Internal Affairs, but was stonewalled and redirected to local law enforcement. After John's complaint to Internal Affairs PD, a large group of officers parked and stood outide his house doing nothing at 10PM
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UoCgiQwGBE">
        video
       </a>
       . He recorded diaries of Fresno police coming to his house and uploaded them to youtube. Frightened, he posted
       <a href="http://socialnewsdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Screen-Shot-2016-01-28-at-9.39.28-AM.png">
        this on facebook
       </a>
       On 19th of January 2016, John Lang was discovered dead with stab wounds in his back and abdomen while his house was on fire. Fresno Police ruled it a suicide and no real investigation took place, and the fact that he predited his own death is concerning. This recieved little media attention, and it's time for some answers.
      </p>
      <p>
       He kept a video diary, and this did not recieve the appriopiate attention because of the election. It's time we revisited it.
      </p>
      <p>
       He said if he turned up missing or dead, remember this van:

       ''Did a bit of digging, and uncovered that Fresno Police Chief Jerry Dyer has an interesting past; from child rape to killing and framing their suicides'' -

       I found it strange he received the promotion to Sergeant of Internal Affairs in 80s after he was investigated for statutory rape, which was never pursued by the Internal Affairs Unit in 2 separate investigations, even though Dyer admitted the "mistake" publicly. The same Internal Affairs that stonewalled Lang, and led to Police officers outside his home. For a bit more information on his character, here's a 10-minute video.

       ''Moralez, who was a cop in Fresno for 30 years, was found dead in 2004 not far from home of the Chief of Police, Jerry Dyer. In 2004, Dyer suspended Moralez for violating department policy, and took his badge and firearm from him. On November 9, 2004, Moralez went to Dyer's home to confront him.-- That was the last time anyone saw Jose Moralez''

       ''It was reported at the time that a motorist saw Jose face down, near a truck, with an alleged self-inflicting gunshot wound to his chest''. His death was ruled a suicide, despite statement made by then City Manager, Daniel G. Hobbs, saying that ''not everyone believed Jose's death was a suicide''.

       A friend of mine's mother had a decades-long pill addiction, and eventually died from an overdose. An autopsy was not offered by her local authorities because foul play was not suspected.
      </p>
      <p>
       My friend paid $300 for a partial autopsy to see whether the overdose was accidental or intentional. It took 4 months to receive the results, which were done by a private company that was recommended by the county.

       While both of you are missing my point. My point is it'd be more accurate to state "I can't imagine not pursuing a personal autopsy if I was her family". My point is speaking in absolutes tends to obscure the issue at hand and not add to the conversation.

       An autopsy was done... And the conclusion of stabbing and carbon monoxide poisoning from smoke is a very probable cause of death. The family doesn't need another autopsy... The Fresno one was plenty accurate, just the suicide conclusion is very, very weird (???)

       Because Seth Rich is a disgustingly politicized tragedy that is representative of how desperate the alt-right has become for credibility. I know conspiracy doctrine automatically dictates "there are no coincidences", but the fact that Seth's parents have to go and tell the internet to stop politicizing their son's murder, the fact that only right-wing scumbags are pushing the narrative, the fact that T_D and co. keep referring to it as an "investigation" when they are doing everything but investigating it - it just gets ridiculous, and sickening.
      </p>
      <p>
       Meanwhile, this man has concrete proof that the Fresno PD conspired against him, carefully documented the entire ordeal, and was still squashed like a bug by these pigs? And everyone stays silent, because it doesn't serve a political agenda? This is what conspiracies are, what we should be investigating. This is the shit that needs to be uncovered, not something that will serve to further some ulterior motive. Things like this need to see the brightest light of day because it's the right thing to do.

       has a strong point, but oyu have to look at it in another way.
      </p>
      <p>
       You have a case with intense documentation that should be fairly easy to follow up on and lock down the people responsible. There's easily discernible faces on that first video and a history that's easy to follow. It's all but ignored.
      </p>
      <p>
       You have another case that doesn't have close to the same amount of documentation, just lots of words on the internet and guesstimates. However, it gets a hell of a lot more attention and is still ongoing in a lot of ways.
      </p>
      <p>
       In a vacuum, it doesn't make any sense. Why wouldn't you pursue the case with far more hard evidence? The key difference is that Lang's death isn't as consequential as Rich's death, in terms of national impact and awareness. It's possible that something huge could come form solving Lang's murder, but we
       <em>
        know
       </em>
       something massive would come from solving Rich's murder.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's how I see this, anyway.

       ...putting flat Earth and reptilians in the same sentence is not fair. There is substantial evidence suggesting Reptilians could be real. I understand the easier kneejerk reaction is to deny their existence because is scary... But if you believe we live on a globe and all the stars we can see are real then you better believe that Reptilians could be real. You should make a post debunking Reptilians if you're so sure. You'd be a star.

       Yep. You ask anyone to prove any of the details of the official story and they devolve into a shrieking troll accusing you of being evil and labeling you a demented conspiracy theorist.

       It's unfortunate that it's logistically impossible to have a "no crazies" conspiracy discussion zone. Look at this subthread talking about interviews with underground reptilians talking about crystal matrix data. It's a blight on this thread.

       It's not unfortunate at all. I'm incredibly grateful it's not like that here.

       Though I'm positive there's something or multiple things you believe that would get you labeled crazy by someone if you believe any conspiracy theories at all, you're entirely free to go ahead and create your "no crazies" allowed sub and police it according to what you believe is "crazy" or not.

       Speaking of Sandy Hook someone close to me worked at the hospital involved after the event.  By talking to their fellow employees they found out there was no one who came in with bullet wounds that day.  If administration found anyone talking about Sandy Hook you would be terminated.

       Personally, I really like the alleged interview with the Reptilian woman Lacerta and if she is telling the truth the Reptilians are from Earth and evolved here and live underground primarily and also are not our enemy.
      </p>
      <p>
       That little tid bit made me feel a lot better, lots of info in the Lacerta interview seems very interesting but who knows.

       I loved it, one of the things that really makes me wonder about it is that she says her kind found a relic that had a giant quartz crystal with millions of years of data in it and she said the information was 'embedded within the molecular structure of the crystal' and this interview was released in 1999 IIRC
      </p>
      <p>
       Cut to 2016 and this article is released:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.extremetech.com/extreme/223144-researchers-develop-superman-memory-crystal-that-could-store-360tb-of-data">

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       So that makes that little tid bit of info either prescient fiction or simply truth.

       Yeah the data in the quarts Lacerta said informed her kind of the great wars that took place millions of years ago on Earth and according to her were the cause of one of the main extinctions of the dinosaurs.

       I always found this fascinating. Might not be documented on memory crystals but for the time period they certainly went into a lot of peculiar detail.

      <h2>
       1561 celestial phenomenon over Nuremberg
      </h2>
      <p>
       The 1561 celestial phenomenon over Nuremberg was a mass sighting of celestial phenomena or unidentified flying objects (UFO) above Nuremberg, Germany. The phenomenon has been interpreted by some modern UFO enthusiasts as an aerial battle, possibly of extraterrestrial origin. This view is mostly dismissed by skeptics, some referencing Carl Jung's mid-twentieth century writings about the subject while others find the phenomenon is likely to be a Sun Dog.

       Have you read any of David Ickes books? He has a lot of info on reptilians, the history of the 13 bloodlines, secret societies, etc. His book The Biggest Secret is pretty good.

       Alas I have not actually read his books yet. Watched a good amount of videos. I've always been more of a sci-fi fan but I think I need to try some potentially non-fiction stuff. Is there a category for books that are written as non-fiction but haven't been verified yet? Semi-fiction? Idk. At the same time I also really want to read Phillip K. Dick's work. Somehow I managed to miss his stuff..

       I'd highly recommend Icke's "Human race get off your knees: the lion sleeps no more". To be honest with you, I didn't know what a 'conspiracy theory' even was until after I finished the book and the only reason I picked it up was cuz it thought it'd help me somehow with the whole 'spiritual Ascension' thing. The former chapters seemed quite deep and relatable as I skimmed through. I'd only just started reading books on ESP and the super human feats by those Indian Yogis started making more sense the more I delved into Icke's book. Finally I decided to borrow it from the school's library ( I'm probably the first to have borrowed and actually read the whole thing ). 
This was two years ago. I'm graduating high school soon.
I live in a Hindu community and Icke's book made it pretty clear as to why there are countless references to Serpent Gods (Nagas) in many Hindu scriptures as well as to the nature of other dimensional realms.

       dude reptilians is absolutely on the same level as flat earth if you are talking sentient humanoid shape-shifting reptilian overlords living on earth. Maybe aliens that happen to be reptilian-esque, but at that point it has the same amount of evidence as any other type of alien, and less than the 'greyling' variety.

       William Tompkins is certainly more credible than you. Get back to me when you can prove what he is saying is false. Until then I'm going to refrain from jumping to conclusions, like you must have won many trophies and medals for in your life for doing.

       I've seen that 3 hour interview. I remember him talking about aliens, which I think there is reasonable evidence for. Thin grey aliens are a recurring theme for a reason. There is exactly as much evidence for what he is saying as there is for Xenu and scientology: no physical evidence. The burden of proof is on the person making the claim.
      </p>
      <p>
       I never said they do not exist, way to jump to conclusions, I bet you've won many trophies for that. They may or may not exist. There is no physical evidence that they do. Not a single body, piece of DNA, photograph, video, or anything else.

       So you can't prove anything. If you watched the interview and can even come within a mile of comprehending the reality of the situation that he is suggested you would understand that you can't just go providing physical proof of aliens to the public like you are requesting.

       There is a lot of evidence that NASA doctored footage. They probably did go to the moon, samples of moon dust exist that could not have originated on earth due to their isotopic composition. Whether somebody walked on its surface is another question. As is, whats the point of going to the moon?

       So you didn't watch his video where he says we went to the Moon and the true story is the astronauts looked into a crater and there were     "hundreds of 9ft tall Reptilians" looking up at them IIRC.
      </p>

       When considering his story as truth... It would logically follow that the "we never went to the Moon" theory is a psy op.

       That sounds like a bad sci fi plot twist. WTF would they be doing there? Little to no atmosphere, no water, no structures, emitting no radiation? Again without evidence I don't take what anyone says as true.

       Thats fair, flat earth can easily be demonstrated to be false, reptilian aliens is an example of a non-testable theory. They both have the same amount of evidence SUPPORTING them. So I could literally make up a theory right now... I believe that all politicians are sufficiently advanced cyborgs that they are indistinguishable from humans, like in blade runner, and they are created by our overlord who lives inside the sun to control us and make us fight/be non-unified. The sun does not produce the correct amount of gravity because its actually HOLLOW.

       Reptilians are often symbols for Jews in the same way that "Illuminati" and all similar shadow-cabal theories are often symbols for Jews. That's not a statement about those things being

       Jon Ronson, author of "The Men Who Stare at Goats," did a real solid investigation into that theory, and, I feel, debunked it. Icke seems sincere in his belief about reptilians and isn't using code-words for anti-semites:

       "I am being targeted by multiple City of Fresno departments and the Fresno Sheriff's Office for comments I made on the Fresno Bee from 2009 to 2013. Comments that were critical of the way Fresno PD and Fresno Fire utilized their budgets. My Disqus handle during that time was "John21". Posters on the Fresno Bee, using the then Disqus comment system were suppose to be anonymous. However, Fresno Bee employee Jody Murray shared Fresno Bee log data and ip address information with Jared L McCormick, a Fresno Sheriff Sergeant, who then used the Fresno Bee provided information to retrieve name and address information in order to maliciously track-down, stalk, and harass Fresno Bee comment posters, including myself.
      </p>
      <p>
       McCormick's Disqus handle on the Bee was "Hikerdude1967". I notified Jim Boren, the then Fresno Bee Editor via email on two occasions in 2013 regarding an employee at the Bee who was sharing website ip and log data of Fresno Bee commenters with Fresno PD and Fresno Sheriff personnel. I explained in these emails that as a result of Jody Murray's nefarious efforts Fresno Bee commenters were subsequently stalked and harassed by Fresno Law Enforcement. I never received a reply from from Mr. Boren on either occasion. However, consequently, I have been made a constant target of harassment, intimidation, and worse by multiple City of Fresno Departments and the Fresno Sheriff's office."

        It's called the mainstream ban, only select comments they agree with and only further their agendas are approved. Comments go through what's called the "truth gauntlet" where it gets poked and prodded, stripped of anything thought proving, and finally monetized, limping out of the gauntlet whimpers the "mainstream truth".

       At approximately 8:30 Pm on 4/11/2015 George and Maxine Ramirez, my neighbors, invite me over to their house. After an hour and a half or so I start to get unexpectedly uncomfortable.  Quickly, I stand up from sitting on the couch and explain I need to leave because I believe I've lost my wallet.  As I walk toward the door Maxine Ramirez immediately blocks my path to the front door and puts her hands up and says “no you can't leave, just sit down”.

       Apparently there was a time long, long, long ago when cops actually helped citizens in need lmao. Now it seems like all they are good for is illegally detaining, beating and murdering people that question ne thing they do that should b questioned.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't fucking get it they harass,threaten and "allegedly" kill some guy for whistle-blowing on them running a stupid fucking license plate scam. All seems so idiotic on the cops part but I guess when u can do what ever the fuck u want with no reprocusion u tend to get a little carried away :/

       Police corruption is a real thing, and it is precisely because the oversight is inadequate and has a conflict of interest. Thats not really a controversial opinion anywhere, except maybe within a police department.

       Hahahaha, ok so a wiki page on NYPD cases proves that the fresno, CA police are corrupt and probably killed John Lang and justifies having +2300 upvote thread with people circle jerking about it. Got it.

       People keep holding to the idea that there was a time when everything was peachy and mankind lived in harmony, and that time was in the recent past.  This isn't admonishing you in any way, just to be clear, but I want to say the authorities being corrupt goes back a very long way.  There have always been both good and bad people among the ranks of those that enforce the law on the populace, with some helping and some hurting those under their care.

       More importantly than any individual cops' moral fiber (
       <em>
        possibly

       excluding this case), modern policing is and always has been predicated on brutal class and race warfare, and no amount of "good cops" change that.

       Problem is that while it's obviously false that there was ever a time when corruption wasn't an issue, it doesn't matter. What matters is that the issue has been given light, and people can't refuse to see the issue without being absolutely willfully ignorant of it now.
      </p>
      <p>
       The people who want to say stupid things like "most cops are good" aren't looking at the issue wanting all cops to be the good guy. They know that only a few of the actions of police ever reach major acknowledgement. They know that when one cop breaks the law, those around that cop typically become accomplices and commit perjury. They know that police investigate police, meaning the entire situation is compromised by a conflict of interest in it's very best of situations, and blatantly corrupt in others.
      </p>
      <p>
       Does this mean every last cop is some evil villian waiting around the corner to do something criminal in nature? Nope. It does mean that most cops have lost respect for the law and for the communities they police, along with most of their empathy for fellow humans. This is a procedural, systemic, cultural, and societal problem that needs to be dealt with. That lack of accountability that police enjoy will come back to bite them, and it won't be good for police, or for society. It would be better for everyone in the long run to get cops under control.

       Was watching a UK police show yesterday (brit now in the US) and I'd forgotten how friendly 99% of them are, and genuinely want to help, even being polite and working with criminals once arrested to make sure all the evidence is heard and it's dealt with fairly and openly, even in the worst circumstances.

       I know not all police are like this, but the majority do seem a lot more caring than the US that I've seen. But once money is involved everyones attitude can be swayed.

       To be fair, I'd imagine it's a lot better being a cop in the UK than in some of the high crime areas in the US. How much do cops in the UK make?

       It's interesting how cops went from being tough guys to dumb people. When hiring these days they don't want the smartest people, they want people who are less intelligent and more likely to follow the herd...I mean union. There are still great cops out there, don't get me wrong, but I feel like their ideal candidate has evolved into not what is best for their community, but who is easiest to manipulate as a pawn.

       "Gang Stalking is a covert government or police investigation. It's similar to Cointelpro or red squads, and it's being used on a lot of innocent people to ruin them and make them look crazy." 
-Urban Dictionary entry which describes this tactic well. 
Also used by the military a lot. 
Anyway his name was John Lang and I will do my best to let it be known that the police were targeting poor folks and he tried to stand up for them.

       Not as much as local governments can be. Local governments and police departments literally get away with murder quite frequently. Not even in a "we have to shut this person up" way, frequently just in a "this guy needs to learn some respect" way.

       I agree. I believe most cops are good people but there are certainly those who are not, just like in every occupation. However, the power a cop has may attract more people who are bad, just as I believe the power politicians have attract more people who are bad.

       I live in frsno and there is many cases of fresno pd killing people and saying it was a accident/suicide my dads friend got surrounded when they raided his home and they all opened fire on him for no reason then said that he fit the description of a wanted man, its no big deal if a man was killed by the Fresno police, dyer the police chief covers his tracks and is not afraid to get his hands dirty, this is a common occurrence.

       This is outrageous.  Thank you OP for bringing this to my attention but the skeptic in me questions timing.  Is this a deflect of bigger fish?  The heat is certainly on and while this seems slam dunk, I can see this pulling attention away from DNC lawsuit, Seth Ritch, MSM bullshit propaganda, and Russian fake intervention.  Again, I was not aware of this specific case and certainly see the validity of it being placed on conspiracy.  I never comment, simply read and observe.  If this story gains traction, I see national attention on Fresno police.  It really seems slam dunk.  All due respect to John Lang.

       Definitely not a distraction. Both cases help each other, and I believe this case should further validate that Seth Rich's isn't out of the realm of possibility to nay-sayers. There are a lot of dark stuff that needs to be unveiled and we should be taking the appropriate steps to bring it to the media. Seth Rich was a hero, and so was John Lang who was an activist fighting corruption in the Fresno police department.

       The Fresno Police Department is one of the most corrupt agencies in the USA.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is a well documented case of a Mexican immigrant who was used by the Fresno Police Department so sell ilegal drugs that they confiscated from drug cartels.  This Mexican sued  the following police officers from Fresno: Pedro Santillan, Epifanio Cardenas, Raymundo Camacho, John Galvan, Vicki Munoz, M. Vincen and detectives  Jerado Chamalbide and Matthew Schiotis.

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Supported by the DEA, Fresno policemen force illegal immigrants to sell drugs. Nothing is being done to stop this. A journalist friend wrote a book about this case in Spanish, an academic from UC at Davis translated this book to publish it in the USA and it was rejected by the University. I wonder why.

       The entire police culture is rotten to the core. There is, imo and without a doubt, no other government arm more corrupt in this country than the conbined US police force.
      </p>
      <p>
       It shocks me that this arm of the government is seemingly above reproach and that all criticism of it immediately brands you as a bad person. No other fucking government agent is treated like they are. You cannot question them. You cannot demand they comply with basic accountability and transparency. Nothing. Anything you demand of them immediately brands you as a cop-hating son-of-a-bitch and dismissed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Meanwhile, these fucks can run drugs, rape, pimp, launder money, steal, extort, harass, beat and even murder with virtual impunity.
      </p>
      <p>
       ... and the most frightening thing about all this is that instead of the populace waking up and demanding more accountability, the police have exploited the political winds and have merged themselves into the political battleground so that, they too, can be auto-defended by so and so political side.
      </p>
      <p>
       That scares the shit out of me. Instead of people doing something about it, they draw political battle lines and the issue becomes another red vs blue auto-defend topic.
      </p>
      <p>
       Shit is getting real scary out here. Smh

       This is a problem with politicizing things that should be bipartisan. BLM has a legit cause, but they have done more to get people to support police than any police propaganda could achieve. It's been a complete failure as a movement, and it hasn't been helped by BLM leaders shifting focus to other politicized causes, because now people are conflating their views on police with issues like affirmative action and feminism, which muddies the issue.
      </p>
      <p>
       The other thing is that, as this case shows, abuse by police often times has nothing to do with race. John Lang is white (or maybe asian?) and the police chief of Fresno is black. But BLM has created the impression that police are on the side of white people and only abuse black men. If Lang was black, this case would be getting more news coverage, but this story doesn't fit the current narrative.

        2012 publication in which Marshall theorized it wasn’t al-Qaida but rather U.S. and Saudi government officials who orchestrated 9/11, was found dead along with his two children in their Murphrys-area home in California

       Funny though how the US Saudi theory is pretty much established as the fact now.

       One would like to think that exposing bullshit pull-over practices by local police wouldn't merit a suiciding, but I'll be damned if I've seen much to counter the whole "the cops murdered him" argument.

       Good on you, the collective 'you'. There's another thread on
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       right now about "getting back on course to talking about conspiracies" "avoiding the trolls and dishonesty pushers".
      </p>
      <p>
       Here, the OP is information packed, clear, with lots of links. Other than one successful "hey, let's talk about flat earth" sub-thread, everyone is either contributing information or supporting the idea of finding out, and not one single "oh, truth just must be not true" disinformation artist-shill-troll has bothered or dared or been paid to smear their shit on this discussion.

       It's called organized stalking, and the intention is for the subject to commit suicide. It plays a large role in the U.S.'s rising mortality rates (including suicides and drug overdoses).

       Great post. I have read about similar accounts from people who have recorded controversial police shootings or have even had personal conflicts with police officers. They can and will make your life hell. Anyone who wishes to expose police corruption would be wise to make sure it never gets traced back to them.

       Careful what you say online. People in the wrong places took note of what he was saying and they took extreme measures to shut him up. That only happens when big money is involved - chances are some heads would roll if whatever Lang was onto came to light and the media took notice. It really is a shame there has been no federal investigation into his death. There are corrupt people in positions of power in Fresno that much seems to be certain - makes you wonder if that corruption extends to the nearby federal field offices or if a few hands have been greased along the way to make this go away. The people who orchestrated this werent even subtle about it either - look at the camera rig they had in the van - that's state of the art, top dollar equipment. Petty house thieves aren't going to have access to such technology. I am amazed they went through such lengths to shut this guy up (the expensive camera in the van was this biggest give-away that this was a professional operation). Killed by stabbing, house set on fire, yet still ruled a suicide.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Police Chief seems like the best angle to pursue here. You can't ignore his history and you can bet he's hired plenty of corrupt cops in his time. I'd bet the ticketing scheme was just the tip of the iceberg with the Fresno PD.

       They will never get in trouble for this.  The police here are backed by the DEA, the FBI, ICE, ... they are all in on it.   I would like to say THERE ARE GOOD POLICEMEN HERE!  They are not all bad.  For the most part, they save lives.  But what goes on here in regards to corruption - it'll never stop.  They won't be brought down.  I promise u that!  Fresno is an experiment.  A test city.  they are allowed to do whatever the hell they want here .

       I don't go for a lot of the stuff on this site, but as a local, I totally think some conspiracy happened with this. Kern and Fresno counties have a pretty long history of crooked local police, DAs, and sheriffs.

       I was born and raised in Fresno for over 20 years. I don't live there anymore, thankfully, but I know a ton of people who grew up with Dyer and went to school with him. He used to smoke crack in my aunts garage back in the day. Hardly anyone there likes him and we all know he's a crook. 
This is absolutely outrageous.

       What? I believe the man was murdered, it's extremely suspicious. I was talking about Dyer being a crook, the chief of police. Not the man in the article who's death was ruled a "suicide".

       I'm not even a little bit surprised. Fresno is such a shithole. The police there operate like a street gang. The victim needed to get out of town before lighting this one. California's law enforcement system is corrupt from the ground up however. Probably no where he could have ran.

       Imagine all the people the Police kill everyday who will never be known or go unreported.  These guys seem pretty good at targeting a single civilian.  You know they are doing this exact same thing to new and different people as you read this.  Bring these Terrorists to justice.

       Speaking of Sandy Hook someone close to me worked at the hospital involved after the event.  By talking to their fellow employees they found out there was no one who came in with bullet wounds that day.  If administration found anyone talking about Sandy Hook you would be terminated.
