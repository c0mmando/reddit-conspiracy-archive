       I think this might be related to this guy claiming to be banned:

      </p>
      <p>
       But in the thread containing the post I linked OP got kicked for being belligerent and a mod implied that was the initial reason for their ban as well.

       Not sure if it's true but they say posting there gets you banned from here.

       Seems unfair but that said that entire sub is pretty brigade-y. Pretty much exclusively used to shit on t_d and r/conspiracy. In fact most of the content of that board comes from one angry r/conspiracy lurker.

       , and now anyone who has ever commented in that sub, even if you showed up to say "I think you guys are wrong and
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy

       isn't that bad", your account will be autobanned.

       I think you should provide more evidence.  I don't think that people should be banned for simply commenting on another sub.  That said,
       <a href="/r/topminds">
        /r/topminds
       </a>
       of reddit is basically just Shareblue propaganda, and their users harass this sub constantly.

       This is all the evidence there is.  I guess I could somehow also prove that the linked comment is my
       <em>
        only
       </em>
       comment ever made in that sub but I'm not really sure how to prove that.  And I can't prove that I didn't use the Chrome edit mode to just fake the message.  So all that's left is for other people to try posting there and see if it happens to them, too.

        Posting links in other subs pointing to specific submissions or comments here is subject to a ban, depending on context.

      <p>
       That has nothing to do with what we're talking about.  We're talking about being banned for
       <em>
        making a comment
       </em>
       in another sub,
       <em>
        even if

       that comment is in support of
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">

      <p>
       I didn't think twice about it.  Why would I?  I post comments in a lot of subs.  I see someone spreading a factual error, like "
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       mods are breaking reddit site-wide rules", I corrected them.
      </p>
      <p>
       How was I supposed to know their rumour would turn out to be 100% true?  There's no rule here that says "Do not post in
       <a href="/r/TopMindsOfReddit">
        /r/TopMindsOfReddit
       </a>
       or your account will be autobanned.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not asking for an appeal for
       <em>
        my
       </em>
       account.  I'm saying this is awful for
       <em>
        everyone
       </em>
       , it needs to stop, and we either need to get rid of these mods or make a new sub.

       But it isn't awful.  If you think so, make another sub.  Our mods are quality, and this was a motion to keep this sub at peace.

       The new mods are old members, for the most part.  I don't know one of them, but assume the old mods do.

      <p>
       Except they're obviously not "quality" if they're literally autobanning users just for making a single comment in another subreddit.  That's about as far as it gets from moderator quality.

       You definitely shouldn't be banned for that but at the same time you gotta know not to feed the trolls. If these people are willing to spend their time mocking conspiracy theorists they're probably already pretty attached to the idea that we're crazy and arguing with them won't do anything to change that.

       I wasn't trying to.  I know not to get into that kind of retarded argument.  I just saw one, massive factual error being upvoted to the top and repeated:  "This breaks Reddit site-wide rules".  I posted a comment correcting that, explaining how it doesn't, and how they confused rules for "community guidelines"
       <em>
        and that's it.
       </em>
       How was I supposed to know their rumour would actually turn out to be true?

       How is automatically banning people without warning, regardless of the context of the comment, even if it's just going into another sub and calling them out on their idiocy, good for this sub?  It's literally

        banning good people from this sub

I think I only got a few comments over there, but it is pretty standard procedure for TMOR to summon people over there to discuss their posts since they won't venture into our threads to comment... but they are more of an antiT_D sub now... got topics slamming on The Donald on the front page n shit.

       They might be using the old SRS tactic of only searching for posts above a certain vote count.  My comment got 25 upvotes because I pointed out a factual error they were making.

       Either way, no matter how awful of a sub they are, secret censorship and automatically banning people without posted rules or warnings is not the answer.

       No man, it's not good, I got banned for saying "You guys are wrong and
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       is allowed to do this".  They are banning people regardless of the context of the comment.  It's retarded.

       Rule 9 says this:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Posting links in other subs pointing to specific submissions or comments here is subject to a ban, depending on context.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       That has nothing to do with what we're talking about.  We're talking about being banned for
       <em>
        making a comment
       </em>
       in another sub,
       <em>
        even if
       </em>
       that comment is in support of
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       .  That's not a rule here.   There is no warning about that.  There is no way to know about that other than other people's rumours.
