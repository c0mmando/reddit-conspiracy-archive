    <div class="md"><p>Linda,
Thank you for participating in this AMA. I am humbled by your dedication to your son. </p>

<p>Few know the case better than you and it is tempting to ask you about decades-old details. But instead I&#39;d like to focus on specific ways we can help, including with the lawsuit. Since one of your most recent statements is via /pol/, I&#39;ll be referencing that in these questions.</p>

<p>1) In his interview with Russia Insider that was released yesterday, your attorney R. David Lewis alluded to the strange forces behind the stonewalling of your current lawsuit. You also asked for legal assistance through Judicial Watch due to their FOIA case expertise. What are some of the most outrageous and unethical ways that you have been treated during this FOIA nightmare (i.e. typographical errors)? What other specific ways do you think can the public or other non-profits help you break through this roadblock? </p>

<p>2) You mentioned that you would like to encourage whistleblowers to send information to Wikileaks about the case. You also mentioned that one of the newest, most valuable pieces of evidence is a confession letter from one of the killers that you learned of in 2015. What are your &quot;Most Wanted&quot; pieces of evidence or documents, either that you know exist or think exist? (The audiotaped statement comes to my mind.) </p>

<p>Thank you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for allowing me to be here.  Regarding the stonewalling of the lawsuit, it seems to have met the same brick wall we have been banging our heads against for almost 30 years now.  All  Arkansas federal judges recused themselves from the case except one, Judge Miller, whose desk it has sat on for 10 months with no action.  I can&#39;t imagine that Judge Miller has some personal reason to keep this lawsuit from going forward, so the question becomes who does -- and who has the power to stop it.  </p>

<p>One example of outrageous treatment over an FOI request was with the FBI. When the book  &quot;The Boys On The Tracks&quot; was being written, FOIs were submitted.  Although the FBI investigated the case for nearly 2 years, they claimed they had -0- documents on the case.  Appeal after appeal was submitted to no avail.  Then a person I didnt even know somehow came to have 8 FBI documents which he shared with me.  Mara Leveritt, author of the book about the boys went to state senator Vic Snyder and appealed to him to intervene, which he did in a sit down meeting in Washington.  Two years after the first FOI went out, the FBI admitted to having over 17,000 pages relevant to our request.  Of those 17,000 plus, we received a little over 2,000 which were heavily or totally redacted.  I want unredacted copies of all FBI documents which I know exist.  The drug / weapon smuggling out of the Mena airport was a CIA operation.  Do they have any documents relative to the boy&#39;s deaths?  I don&#39;t know but believe I am entitled to them if there are any.</p>

<p>The thought behind sending any information one may have to Wikileaks is two  fold.  There is no one here in this county or state with an interest in seeing this case solved. Our county sheriff is the nephew of Dan Harmon who I believe we have proof of that he was one of the killers, Kirk Lane is chiefof police in our town of Benton -- also has been named as a suspect by several witnesses.  And lastly, it is my belief that the Clintons are the power behind it all.   Mena was their first pay to play game before they moved to Washington and expanded it to a global level.  I have never claimed or believed that the Clintons were down on the tarmac unloading drugs or that they killed My son.  But they were raking in millions from the operation and have obstructed justice in this case to cover up their crimes.</p>

<p>As far as how the public can help,  This is a 30 year old case.   I am hoping that shining a light on it and raising awareness about it will put pressure on, or interest the right people to help us move this case to a conclusion.   I tried for years to keep it local because it was local people that killed the boys and I thought it would improve our chance of a prosecution. Wrong.  I now believe in my heart of hearts that seeing the Clintons fall is my only hope.  I have no illusion that this case is going to bring them down, but I want to add it to the pile -- Kevin still matters!</p>

<p>Just as a note for the sub, Kirk Lane was named as a suspect by the makers of <em>Obstruction of Justice: The Mena Connection</em> based on a second hand jailhouse informant&#39;s story. Lane won a libel case against the makers of the film before it was overturned in the 8th Circuit citing that Lane was a public figure.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is true, but to add to that, from an Arkansas State Police report dated Feb 27 1990...</p>

<p>(a little background first - Mike Crook was a club owner who relayed in testimony what someone told him they witnessed at the grocery store where Kevin and Don were allegedly beaten on the night of their murders... Crook then goes on to say the following of his own accord to the A.S.P. ...)</p>

<p>&quot;CROOK states that before KEITH MCKASKLE was killed, MCKASKLE told him that KIRK LANE and JAY CAMPBELL of the Pulaski County Sheriff&#39;s Office were following him around and he was afraid they were going to kill him.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;CROOK also states that after MCKASKLE was killed, LANE and CAMPBELL shot up his house one night. He states that his son was at the club and someone called and said MCKASKLE is dead and you are next and later the shots were fired into his house and then he looked out he saw the Camero going down the raod from his house that KIRK LANE drives. He states that he called the Little Rock Police Department but they never came out.&quot;</p>

<p>Also, to add, about the witnesses(plural) at the Ranchette Grocery Store, where Kevin and Don were beaten, another witness was Ronnie Godwin, and he identified 2 police officers as the ones who beat the boys and threw them into the car. His description matched that of Lane and Campbell.</p>

<p>Also, Keith Coney told his mom, before he was killed himself, that he saw it was &quot;2 men that killed Kevin and Don&quot;. A friend of Coney&#39;s father also stated that he was told that Keith Coney told his dad that it was &quot;the cops&quot; that killed Kevin and Don. Campbell and Lane???</p>

<p>Campbell and Lane are named not just &quot;based on a second hand jailhouse informant&#39;s story&quot;.</p>

<p>There are plenty of reasons to bring them in for questioning.</p>

<p>Campbell&#39;s history reads something like that of Dan Harmon too with major felnoy convictions etc over the years.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>an addendum to my response above where I stated there had been no action on the case in 10 months -- In December of 2016 I had two major surgeries, carotid arteries roto rooted out and triple bypass with aortic valve replacement a week later.  After that, was hospitalized with RSV for a week and then 2 weeks later hospitalized with the flu and other complications. For this reason, I was not in contact with my attorney, David Lewis,  about the case during December, January or February and was unaware a motion had been made to dismiss by the government to which David responded to December.  Thus my assumption that nothing had happend with the case in 10 months.  The correct time frame would be 6 months which is still out of the ordinary.  </p>

<p>So very glad to see you&#39;re recovering well from your surgeries dear!</p>

<p>Very distressing that the govt. wants to &quot;dismiss&quot; the lawsuit. Just shows that they don&#39;t want the Boys&#39; murders to be solved!</p>

<p>There are loads and loads of redacted(blacked out) documents pertaining to Kevin and Don&#39;s murders. It&#39;s been 29 years. And the govt. doesn&#39;t want those documents to be un-redacted??? </p>

<p>That&#39;s what the lawsuit is about.</p>

<p>Documents that could(most likely would) lead to the official solving of this case, and the govt. ... the American Government!... doesn&#39;t want to release them?!?!?</p>

<p>What happened to &quot;Truth, Justice, and the American Way!&quot;?!?!?</p>

<p>Every politician that knows anything about Kevin and Don and did nothing about it(which is all of them) should be ASHAMED of themselves at a minimum!</p>

<p>God bless you Linda, and THANK YOU! for being so courageous and determined in your fight against such evil perpetrators.</p>

<p>One day Justice will be served.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Part of the reason that the case is an FOI nightmare is two fold. One, Arkansas legislators have been working to weaken Arkansas&#39; FOI laws in this last legislative session, and two, Linda&#39;s FOI request is incredibly broad and requests documents from private entities that aren&#39;t covered under Arkansas&#39; FOI laws. The Arkansas Times, which was traditionally supportive of her before her efforts became a partisan witch hunt, made the comment that the FOI request names everyone in Arkansas other than the Fouke Monster and Santa Claus as a party.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Number one on the list as far as killers would be special prosecutor Dan Harmon who orchestrated the murders and cover up.  The others I believe were there are Keith Mckaskle, Larry Roushall, Sharline Wilson, narcotics detective kirk Lane, narcotics detective Jay Campbell, and deputy Danny Allen.  The list of those directly involved in the coverup not listed already includes deputy prosecutor Richard Garrett, then sheriff Jim Steed, detective Chuck Tallent, detective Rick Elmendorf, Judge John Cole and many, many others who have been willing to look the other way over the years.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hello and thanks so much for being with us today;</p>

<p>As someone who is just learning about the Mena, Arkansas incidents involving Adler Berriman &quot;Barry&quot; Seal and potentially the Clintons.</p>

<p>My question is thus; the local prosecutor at the time alleges that he asked for $20,000 from the Governor (Clinton) to look into the incidents at the Mena airport. Although this funding never arrived, Clinton later claimed he offered those funds directly to that local prosecutor&#39;s boss? Was Clinton&#39;s claim a load of hogwash?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, Clinton doing what he does best -- lying.  Prosecutor Black was an honorable man trying to do his job.  By the way, Asa Hutchinson, our present governor, was a federal prosecutor in that district who helped cover the crimes in Mena.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Some things I perceived as a threat -- A few times long ago, 1988, I would come home when my husband was out of town, and all my doors would be standing open.  I think it was mind games, just to show methey could do it.  I would have to call my nearest neighbor, whose house was about a block away,  to come search my house with me.  There was never anything disturbed.  Another time in 1994 someone left a little cardboard target practice man like you see with points for different parts of the body and a plastic police badge on Kevin&#39;s grave.  I reported it to the FBI who was working on the case and asked them to make a report on it.  They did not want to and I would be shocked if they did.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow, thanks for that comment!  We knew early on that there were drugs drops involved but assumed it was a small local operation.  Our focus for many years was on who was there and not where the drugs came from.  It wasn&#39;t until 1990 that we learned the drugs were being dropped by plane.  We were able to locate a pilot, who was interviewed by Jean Duffey (a former deputy prosecutor and drug task force director).  He stated he had flown that &quot;route&quot; a number of times and we were able to corroborate geographical information he provided.</p>

<p>I am not in touch with Don&#39;s family and have not been in many years, so I have no idea what, if anything they have done.  Curtis Henry, Don&#39;s dad, is a friend of Dan Harmon, (who numerous witnesses name as one of the killers).  He testified as a character witness at harmon&#39;s criminal trial where he was convicted years later of running a criminal enterprise out of the prosecutor&#39;s office.  He also testified for kirk Lane and Jay campbell in a civil trial, both of whom have been names as suspects. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is in response to your question about the Clintons and CIA which I inadvertently overlooked.  There is no doubt that Mena was a CIA operation, and there is no doubt that Clintons were aware of it.  I believe Mena was their first pay to play game and they rakedin millions, just as they do now on a global basis.  Kevin and Don were nobody, but something made them very important.  There is no evidence that they were involved in the murders themselves but their fingerprints are all over the coverup.  I believe they are afraid that if the case is solved, it will expose and  their involvement in Mena.  Terry Reed, who was a pilot working with Barry Seal, wrote a book called &quot;Compromised&quot;.  A great read if anyone is interested.  He tells of a meeting with Clinton and other national names which I cannot remember right now, where Clinton was promised the presidency if he went along and allowed them to use Arkansas as a base.  This was while Clinton was still Governor.  I scoffed when I read it, but I&#39;m not scoffing now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I need to amend and clarify my above response for Laragon and the rest of the board.   Arkansas has 5 federal judges -- Miller, who now has the case, Holmes who recused, Marshall, Baker and Moody.There are also 2 senior judges, Susan Webber-Wright and William Wilson, who also recused, so a total of 7.  Then we have magistrates, Ray, Cavaneau, Deere, Harris, Kearney and Volpe -- so technically we have 13.  My statement of more that 2 have recused was inaccurate.  Holmes and Wilson are the only recusals.  I can only assume that I misunderstood what my attorney was explaining to me at the time.  I apologize for the mis-statement, I would never intentionally mislead anyone in any way.</p>

<p>According to the documentary Murder on the Tracks, special prosecutor Dan Harmon initially approached you &quot;as a friend.&quot;</p>

<p>At what point did it become clear that he was not, in fact, a friend, and was directly involved in drug running and the subsequent coverup of the murder of your son?</p>

<p>To maintain this level of coverup seems to require actual psycopaths in high levels of power (like Dan Harmon and medical examiner Fahmy Malak). </p>

<p>I just want to conclude by remarking that it takes immense courage on your part for going head-to-head against those who are completely devoid of empathy and a single shred of human decency.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is an FBI document that states there are &quot;at least 8 other deaths connected&quot; to the boys murders.  The private detectives working on it think there are many others. I truly have no idea how many high level officials were involved, but many, andI think itgoes to the very top in DC.  I think the drugs are still flowing freely, there is so much money involved.  I also believe the CIA is the biggest drug running operation in business today.
I would be so grateful if everyone would help me raise awareness about the case -- hopefully the right people, whomever that might be, will step in and help move the case to its&#39; rightful conclusion.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nothing as far as an outcome of the local sheriff&#39;s office.  The only thing local detectives did was to get a list of names of their classmates and call them to ask if they thought the boys were suicidal.  I do have a copy of that file.</p>

<p>There have been two retired detectives who have examined the documents I have amassed over the years.  They became outraged that nothing had been done and have been working on this case free of charge.  I had received a copy of Sharline Wilson&#39;s confession when I FOIed the Arkansas State Police file in the early 90s.  When I questioned authorities about it I was told that Sharline Wilson was a liar who could not even pass a polygraph on her name.  What they did not tell me was that many other agencies were then, and in the past, had used her as an informant and consideredher to be very credible.  When one of the private detectives came across Sharline&#39;s confession in 2015, he attempted to confirm, or discredit the very detailed information.  He was able to confirm some of the information, and more importantly, determined that it matched the crime scene.  This detective was formerly chief of homicide in Little Rock, our capital city, and in charge of making the decision in cases on whether or not someone was charged. He believed there was enough probable cause to arrest Sharline.  He and me and my husband wentto see the local prosecutor to request they bring Sharline in.  He literally laughed in our face and told us he was not going to do anything and suggested we go to the sheriff&#39;s office and talk to the sheriff. We did just that, even though we knew it was wasted effort because the sheriff is the nephew of Dan Harmon who Sharline names as one of the killers.  They promised to work the case, but two years later they have not even interviewed Sharline or, of course, his uncle.</p>

<p>Frustrated over no action from the sheriff or prosecutor we contacted all the local media. Only one tv station was interested. They came to my house, spent about 3 hours filming and looking at documents and told me they would run it the next day.  It did not run, so i called to ask why -- they said they had decided to hold it until sweeps week the following month which was May.  It did not run.  All my calls and texts went unanswered.  Finally i sent a rather pointed message in September and the reporter texted me back telling me she had had a very busy summer and that they had decided not to run the story.</p>

<p>Every level of government has been FOIed.</p>

<p>I have received what i perceived as threats in 1988 and one in 19994.  They are not worried about me, they believe they have me contained and have bigger fish to fry these days:))  but I am ever vigilant and declare I am not suicidal.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for the AMA, I&#39;d like to ask you about a few of many points that have been touched on yet not substantially explained as far as I can tell.</p>

<p>How and on what occasions did Robert Shepherd interfere with investigations into the deaths?</p>

<p>As Arkansas State Democratic Chairman, how did Lib Carlisle have the authority to order the state police to stop their investigation?</p>

<p>In what way did Don Birdsong corrupt the investigation?</p>

<p>What evidence is there that Birdsong&#39;s liaison appointment was influenced by actions he took to corrupt the investigation?</p>

<p>What &quot;specific tests&quot; were ordered not to be conducted by state crime lab directors?</p>

<p>It&#39;s noteworthy that the attorney speaking on your behalf is an Arkansas personal injury lawyer, did he have a role in the initial stages of the investigation or any other qualifications for a high-profile double homicide suit?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hi, and thank you Riley.  Unfortunately, the idfiles website has not been updated in many years, it was our first website whose software is now obsolete and we are unable to make admin updates and changes to it -- which is why that is an old email.  I continue to pay for that domain because of the wealth of information that is on there.  I would certainly b willing to talk with you. Although we personally have spen a huge sum of money on the case, am, and always have been, unwilling to ask for money.  My attorney does have a gofund me account to help with his expenses as do the detectives in an effort to cover their expenses.  Raising awareness is my goal, I&#39;m sure many of you were not even born when the boys were killed, so educating those who don&#39;t know about it and those who may not remember it is an important part of pressuring officials.</p>

The drop that was made the week before the boys were killed went missing and the people on the ground were on high alert and trying to find out what happened to it.  Kevin and Don came walking down the tracks, they grabbed them and interrogated them for information they did not have.

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Do you think the drug running ever stopped?&quot;</p>

<p>I can&#39;t speak for Linda, but I&#39;ll weigh in with my thoughts on that question...</p>

<p>Asa Hutchinson was the US Attorney for the Western District of Arkansas from 1982-1986</p>

<p>Barry Seal, the biggest cocaine smuggler in U.S. history, operated out of Mena Airport from 1982-1986</p>

<p>Mena Airport is located in... YUP... the Western District of Arkansas.</p>

<p>So for 4 long years, Hutchinson couldn&#39;t find a thing on Barry Seal and his crew, who were operating right in Hutchinson&#39;s own backyard, and bringing in tons and tons of cocaine.</p>

<p>So naturally, that would qualify him to be the head of the DEA, as appointed by W Bush in 2001 right? Pffft.</p>

<p>And now he is the Governor of Arkansas.</p>

<p>And cocaine is still just as easy, if not easier, to get now as it was in the 1980&#39;s.</p>

<p>It&#39;s all just coincidence... or???</p>

<p>A- it IS easy to get... </p>

<p>and </p>

<p>B- I said it&#39;s as easy to get today as it was in the 1980&#39;s... so whatever difficulty you had in the 1980&#39;s to find it, or be aware of it, you may have the same difficulties today perhaps... Being in a major city, I see that it is STILL just as easy to get today, as it was back then in the 1980&#39;s.</p>

<p>Now if you want to talk about the 1970&#39;s...</p>

<p>Back then, Cocaine was called a &quot;rich man&#39;s drug&quot; and it was called that for a reason... It was hard to get.</p>

<p>Since Iran/Contra, Barry Seal, Danilo Blandon, Ricky Ross and so on, once the taps were turned on... they were never shut off IMO.</p>

<p>Fahmy Malak lied through his teeth in the autopsy... Clinton not only fully backed him, but gave him a raise too. There&#39;s nothing tenuous about that.</p>

<p>Do you believe there was massive amount of cocaine being flown into Mena by Barry Seal and his crew?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s good to see you&#39;re well versed.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t see how you give Clinton a pass on the Ives/Henry murders though.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying Clinton ordered a &quot;hit&quot;, as of course that&#39;s ridiculous. I&#39;m not even saying that he directed the cover-up at all either... Though I believe he probably told someone, at some point, &quot;make sure you keep a lid on it&quot; or something like that.</p>

<p>But the bottom line is that he was Governor at the time of Kevin and Don&#39;s murders, which means all the authorities ultimately report to him, and he did nothing while Malak was lying through his teeth, nor did he do anything about the loads drug trafficking and money laundering was going on by those very officials. </p>

<p>Did nothing?... Or helped it along and covered it up? aaaannnd did some coke while he was at it perhaps???</p>

<p>You obviously know about his half brother Roger Clinton and Dan Lasater as well... that, plus the other multiple sources that have stated they witness Bill Clinton high on cocaine, in itself leads me to believe more of that later than the former.</p>

<p>In theory yes, in practice no. The left hand in Little Rock seldom knows what the right hand, also in Little Rock, is doing even to this day. If you want some <em>real</em> juiciness, look at some of the crap Mike Huckabee pulled off and didn&#39;t even try to hide when he was governor, starting with his quasi-illegal coup on day one of his governorship. It&#39;s even better reading, and it&#39;s more confirmed than most of the Clinton material.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I might also add that Mike Vowell, who was the trace evidence expert at the crime lab, noted that there appeared to be a cut in Don&#39;s shirt and wanted to do further testing to see if the cut matched a wound on his body.  He was instructed by the acting directors of the crime lab not to do any testing, they were &quot;going to back Malak&#39;s ruling.  Later, when Clinton was about to announce his candidacy for president, he created a new job specifically for him with the state health department under Joelyn Elders.  A not of interest.  Jocelyn Elders&#39;s son was arrested some time later for drugs.  The key witness against him was found murdered just before the case went to court and charges were dropped.  They always take care of their own.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My focus has been on Harmon and the others,  who I believe were on the tracks when the murders occurred, for 30 years of slamming up against brick walls with state agencies including the state medical examiner, who answered to nobody but then governor Clinton, a defunct medical&#39;s board commission was resurrected by Clinton, the Arkansas sheriff&#39;s association got involved in the case which was unprecedented, and more.  When Clinton was elected, the onslaught continued at the federal level. A federal grand jury was shut down, as well as the FBI investigation.  So you have to look at why and who has the power to accomplish that?  Why did Hillary Clinton put me on her &quot;hit list&quot; to be smeared and discredited?  So yes, I am focusing on them in an effort to get their foot off this case.  I could not care less what anyone thinks of my efforts.  Try walking in my shoes for 30 years.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just to add to this... I&#39;m not saying that Mena is currently still bringing in Tons of cocaine... though with Hutchinson as Governor, anything is possible.</p>

<p>I&#39;m just saying that once the coke-flow started in the 1980&#39;s, it didn&#39;t stop.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sure there are plenty of other routes, as well as factions, shipping in cocaine.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually the Coke supply dried up in the early to mid-nineties -at least in NE Arkansas.  There were lots of cocaine busts in my area of the state beginning in early 1990s- mostly lower level dealers and a couple of crop dusters who were flying it in.  I&#39;m very close to people whose lives were lost and ruined because of cocaine use/distribution in the late 1980s.  Once it dried up, they started using meth.  This has had devastating effects on my family, friends, and community over the past 35 years.  The meth epidemic in my community started with the introduction of cocaine in the 1980&#39;s.  I was right in the middle of it.</p>

<p>Kevin and Don were just one year younger than me.  I remember seeing the story on the news right after they were murdered.  I hope and pray that their story brings down those who brought these drugs into my state at a time when my generation was ripe to experiment with it.  My husband--my children&#39;s father--never came out of it.</p>

<p>Thank you, Linda.  I&#39;m praying for you and for Justice.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow, thank you for your interest in the case.  There is no doubt the drugs are still flowing freely, and it is my opinion that the CIA is the biggest drug running operation there is.  But I have no idea where.  I have heard some military bases mentioned but cannot say with any certainty that is true.  If the man you are talking about taking pics of tail numbers of planes is Russell Welch, which I know he did, he was the Arkansas State Police investigator.  I would never in a million years believe he is a predator.  They have done everything in the world to him including poisoning him with military grade anthrax.  So I could easily believe they would  try to discredit him.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There were several incidents in 1988, when my husband was out of town, where I would go home and all of my doors would be standing wide open.  I took them to be mind games and intimidation.  In 1994 someone left a toy cardboard target practice man with body parts marked as points received for a hit on a particular area, and a toy deputy&#39;s badge on Kevin&#39;s grave  I reported it to the FBI who stated they would make a report on it but I don&#39;t believe that they did.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>With all that we know via Congressional hearings/investigations about CIA drug-running it is an insult to humanity that corporatism ultimately wins out and allows the government to continue these rabidly illegal programs.  HSBC caught laundering billions in drug money and getting away with just a <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=bank+laundering+drug+money+billion+dollar+fine&amp;amp;t=ffsb&amp;amp;ia=web">$1.9 billion fine**</a> -- I&#39;d much rather make drugs LEGAL and the public could also be free from paying for the cost to imprison so many of our citizens.  </p>

<p>The national security state is also far too free to keep all this info from the public--wish we had a mandatory 7 year limit on all CIA-FBI-DEA files.  This would allow CIA-FBI (etc.) and the POTUS to run their programs--but ultimately the public would find out about their crime sprees.  POTUS would be allowed 8 years in office before the info started to become public--but at the end of her/his reign there would be accountability, without which our government becomes a <em>fiefdom of gangsters</em>.</p>

<p>I really don&#39;t have a specific question--just wanted you to know there are plenty of people who care about the case and truly are upset with the pain and loss your family and friends have been forced to go through.</p>

<p>I hope the case gets resolved--I&#39;m sure the whole process must feel like you&#39;re being victimized by your own government in perpetuity at this point.  </p>

<p>Best Wishes, SBB.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What a beautifully described memory!  As I read it I saw it clearly in my mind!  But then I might be able to see it so clearly as I also had a 1989 Camaro with T-tops, at age 17, that I was super in love with too.  Mine wasn&#39;t blue, it was like a wine red color.  Anyway, I was able to see the picture you described vividly.  Kind of gave me goosebumps too.  Thank you for sharing such a personal and touching moment of yours.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Absolutely zero.   I had never even heard of Russia-insider until seeing the article and Judicial Watch is not involved in this case in any manner, although I would love it if they were.  I have not made one dime off of this case, even the book.  My payment for the book was 5 free books, end of story.  The timeing of the lawsuit coinciding with the election was not planned.  The lawsuit had been in the works for a very long time actually years.  Every agency which we FOIed stalled, which ended up with several appeals each.  When all of the appeals were exhausted, the lawsuit was filed.  The ony planning that went into it was a huge effort to file it on the anniversary of the murders and it was two days late.  They were murdered on the 23rd of August and the lawsuit was filed on the 25th of August last year</p>

    <div class="md"><p>hmm, already responded to this once, no idea where my reply went, so we&#39;ll try it again.  The answer is zero, nada, zip.  I had never even heard of Russia-insider until that article came out.  By the way, I loved it, it was an excellent article.  Judicial Watch is not involved in the case in any way but I would love it if they were to take it on, we could certainly use their expertise.  Timing?  We started FOI ing documents years ago but each agency did their best to stall, stonewall, etc.  Each agency required numerous appeals, so we are certainly not the ones who picked the timing, they did.  The only timing we had anything to do with was, after all appeals were exhausted, my attorney made a huge effort to get the complaint filed on the anniversary of the boys&#39; murders -- but was 2 days late.  The anniversary was August 23 and the lawsuit was filed on August 25th, 2016.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m sorry I missed your AMA last night, but I just wanted to tell you that I am amazed by how strong you are. I just read your story for the first time yesterday, and I want to express my deepest condolences on the death of your son. For a mother, there is no deeper pain. </p>

<p>As a fellow mom, just thinking about what you have been through and the fact that they have not been able to silence you....the fact that you have not given up on finding the truth after all these years.... I do not have strong enough words to express how much of an inspiration you are to me. Stay strong. Hold your head high. And please let us know what we can do to help. I strongly suspect that bringing your story to light will become a personal mission for many of us. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am constantly trying to figure out what can be done that hasn&#39;t been done before.  It is kind of like the old saying that it is crazy to keep trying the same thing over and over and expect a different result.  We have done petitions in the past, but the problem remains that there is no one to take anything to, be it evidence in the case, petitions, or whatever -- there is no one in this state to take it to who will do anything with it.  For many years we have talked to nearly every official in this state as new ones were elected.  They are all content to look the other way.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>hmm, that is hard to answer  I would take a number of things into consideration .  1  Are they affiliated with a site known for real news and are they likely to present the facts of the case in a fair and balanced manner.   2.  Are they trusted by the public for  personal and professional integrity or are they part of the Clinton clean up crew.  There are not many who fit that criteria that I can think of off the top of my head.  I would have to research them long and hard.  There is a journalist I have not had contact with in many years who was sent by Hillary to destroy and discredit me.  We immediatly clashed and I disliked him immediately, but he ended up writing some very good articles and he became one of my favorites back in the early 90s. So, very hard decision  really because the media has such power.  Trust is hard to come by.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s good to see you&#39;re well versed.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t see how you give Clinton a pass on the Ives/Henry murders though.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying Clinton ordered a &quot;hit&quot;, as of course that&#39;s ridiculous. I&#39;m not even saying that he directed the cover-up at all either... Though I believe he probably told someone, at some point, &quot;make sure you keep a lid on it&quot; or something like that.</p>

<p>But the bottom line is that he was Governor at the time of Kevin and Don&#39;s murders, which means all the authorities ultimately report to him, and he did nothing while Malak was lying through his teeth, nor did he do anything about the loads drug trafficking and money laundering was going on by those very officials. </p>

<p>Did nothing?... Or helped it along and covered it up? aaaannnd did some coke while he was at it perhaps???</p>

<p>You obviously know about his half brother Roger Clinton and Dan Lasater as well... that, plus the other multiple sources that have stated they witness Bill Clinton high on cocaine, in itself leads me to believe more of that later than the former.</p>
