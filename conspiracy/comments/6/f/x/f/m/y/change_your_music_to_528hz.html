       I've read that different hz do different things. So 432 hz is good too.
      </p>

       Example, one is good for healing, one is good for opening up your creativity, etc. etc.

       Here is an interesting website I found. Of course, I don't know if they are reputable or not (don't want people listening to it and getting hypnotized). So definitely do research first.

       You wouldn't listen to a song once and be hypnotized. The idea is people continually listen to their favourite songs while singing along, time after time after time repeating the same words. Your subconscious stores the repetitiveness of the words you sing deep down in your mind. This is brainwashing, borderline witchcraft.

       I know that it wouldn't happen listening to it one time.  :-)

       I was just saying that I just happen to stumble on that website and wasn't sure if their music was actually tuned to that specific hz. So I just wanted people to be aware of that.  :-)

        Very important topic. A432Hz Pythagorean is like medicine, intended to tune your endocrine system. The modern standard A440Hz standard is like candy; it detunes you, but it's really enjoyable to hear. The latter makes up 99.9% of all music you'll ever hear.
       </p>

       But know that converting modern standard A440Hz equal temperament (12-TET) music to A432Hz equal temperament
       <em>
        DOES NOT
       </em>
       convert it to A432Hz Pythagorean tuning. It converts it to A432Hz equal temperament -- not the same frequencies!
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not possible for a player or converter to convert music from 12-TET to Pythagorean, as noted in the link:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        <em>
         NOTE! - Do keep in mind
        </em>
        <em>
         that the change of Concert Pitch alone is not "432 Tuning"
        </em>
        .  432-Tuning is Concert Pitch A4=432Hz + "Pythagorean Temperament". With most Western music (and instruments played) the "Twelve Tone Equal Temperament" (12-TET) is used. These players will
        <em>
         NOT
        </em>
        be able to make real-time changes to the temperament! If you like to read more about the difference between "Concert Pitch" and "Tuning System" then you can find more info here

       It's actually a pain to find A432 Pythagorean tuned music. And most of it, nobody nowadays wants to listen to -- classical, meditation, etc. I searched for a podcast or internet radio station that played Pythagorean A432Hz music, and gave up after a couple hours. AFAIK, it doesn't exist. Most of the music on Youtube labeled "432" is 432 equal temperament -- not the correct frequencies.

       Interesting that you posted this today cause I've been working on creating a guitar tuning that corresponds to higher octaves of the Schumann resonance, and connecting them to what would be lower "octaves" in relation to the visible light spectrum.
      </p>
      <p>
       528 Hz is one of them! It's C major in a A=444 Hz tuning, and it corresponds to the color Green.
      </p>
      <p>
       Other Schumann resonance frequencies are:
      </p>
      <p>
       501 Hz  = primary Schumann Resonance corresponds roughly to the note B. Yellow-Green
      </p>
      <p>
       448 Hz - 2nd SR - closest to  a higher than normal  "A", or a lower than normal "A#". Orange
      </p>
      <p>
       320/640 Hz - 3rd resonance - between a D# and an E. Purple
      </p>
      <p>
       416 Hz - 4th resonance - G# Red
      </p>
      <p>
       528 Hz is the fifth resonance it's the first of them that corresponds with Gamma waves, and, as I mentioned, it's visible light color would be green
      </p>
      <p>
       312/624 Hz is the 6th resonance. It's a D# and corresponds with Blue-violet
      </p>
      <p>
       360/720 Hz -7th and final Schumann frequency.  It actually sits just behind the visual spectrum at both ends, right on the cusps of both Infrared and Ultraviolet light.

       Dude this is interesting. I hear music as colours. Do people hear the same colours? I always thought it was random from person to person. And I am aware of
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synesthesia">
        Synesthesia
       </a>
       ,  both my sister and I seem to "have" it (we even associate almost all the SAME colours to the letters of the alphabet), but I've never really dug too deep into it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some music I simply can't listen to because it's like a sensory/emotional overload. Good music, usually.
      </p>
      <p>
       So if me and another person (who hears colour) listened to the same riff/progression, would we hear the same colours?

       I don't really know at this point. It was just a theory I had yesterday while procrastinating at work.
      </p>
      <p>
       I read a science journal on the effects that different oscillations/frequencies can have on plant and animal cells. And I'd been reading about vibrations in the Horn of Ammon and Pituitary/thalamus in the brain, and how it corresponds to different modes of thought and consciousness.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the one thing that unites all forms of energy/radiation/force, is a response to vibrations, and the frequencies of different types of forces/energies have a similar 2:1 ratio to musical octaves, then it would stand to reason that visible light, sound, and thought would all have shared resonances that affect our mind in corresponding fashions. This is perhaps where synesthesia comes from, and it would help explain stuff like remote viewing, because in essence, all of our major senses perform a single function, detecting oscillations. Remote viewing/esp is therefore just long-range detection of vibrations through space-time.
      </p>
      <blockquote>

       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Not the same, necessarily, but if this person shared similar responses to other forms of stimulus (visual art, taste, physical hobbies) you'd be more inclined to have respond accordingly to the riff as well. I think when we are born or even conceived (playing complex music around a pregnant mother to create complex vibrational resonances in the fetus's developing mind), there probably is a high degree of similarity between all of our responses, but as those experiences become anchored to memories and emotions, the "colors" become more personal. Of course there are frequencies for stimulating childhood memories as well, so that initial oneness is still capturable.

       I don't think anyone understands what Hz are in this kind of context. The only thing I can imagine is that they probably think it means the sample rate of a digital audio file, which is usually given in kHz, meaning that they think you can just change the frequency on a song?
      </p>
      <p>
       But Hz itself is just a measure of frequency, and in the case of a sound wave, that frequency correlates to the pitch of a sound. Higher frequency sound wave equals higher sounding pitch. In digital audio sampling, audio is replicated by taking many "snapshots" per second and putting them together to create the illusion of "motion" over time. It works very much like film, where higher frequency equals smoother motion, while low frequency sample rates would seem jarring, jittery, unnatural, etc. Think of the difference between high quality voice recordings today and the voice recordings that the
