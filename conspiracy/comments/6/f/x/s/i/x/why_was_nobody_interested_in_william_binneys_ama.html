<p>William Binney (Former high level NSA analyst, also whistleblower pre-Snowden): “At least 80% of fibre-optic cables globally go via the US”, Binney said. “This is no accident and allows the US to view all communication coming in. At least 80% of all audio calls, not just metadata, are recorded and stored in the US. The NSA lies about what it stores.” <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/jul/11/the-ultimate-goal-of-the-nsa-is-total-population-control">https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/jul/11/the-ultimate-goal-of-the-nsa-is-total-population-control</a></p>

<p>Binney&#39;s NSA career culminated as Technical Leader for intelligence in 2001. Having expertise in intelligence analysis, traffic analysis, systems analysis, knowledge management, and mathematics (including set theory, number theory, and probability),[7] Binney has been described as one of the best analysts in the NSA&#39;s history.[8] <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Binney_%28U.S._intelligence_official%29">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Binney_%28U.S._intelligence_official%29</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I work in the telecom industry so I can provide a bit of insight here. Copper is unreliable because it&#39;s far more vulnerable to natural disasters (New York copper was damn near completely destroyed in the last hurricane), and even if all goes well it naturally degrades over time. Fiber is just better for the provider and the customer in the end.</p>

<p>Nobody wants to pay for the upkeep of an unreliable technology so if you want it you will certainly have to pay more for it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>For the most part yeah it&#39;s more reliable in a disaster, but it just takes one event to basically wipe it all out. Copper takes up a ton more space in the CO&#39;s as well whereas fiber is beautifully compact. The main issue though the degradation of copper. They don&#39;t want to reinvest into a &quot;dying&quot; product.</p>

<p>I&#39;m thinking that this is for a reason. One possibility is that privacy rights hadn&#39;t been so eroded when people were still using dial phones.</p>

<p>By the time the surveillance state got going, most people were using cellphones. So TPTB went for the legal weak spot. Another possibility is that they already knew mobile phones were going to take over... so they put in a back door (in a legal sense) at a time when hardly anyone would notice or care.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is because the companies responsible for the copper infrastructure are required to maintain them and they hate to do so. Honestly it&#39;s also more practical for them to just run all services from their fiber system instead of maintaining an old copper system. I do find it suspicious that they try so hard to get customers into a VOIP contract when most people simply have no interest in a home phone numger. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>While I don&#39;t know about this specifically, to record AND store 80% of all phonecalls would take an enormous amount of storage. I did the math and conservative average based on phone usage against only 200m phones (because I doubt the 315m number) and 80% of the calls its 13.284 PetaBytes, per day... of data. All of googles Datacenters combined (14 total) hold (Data from 2016, probably more now) is 15exabytes. thats only 1000 days worth of data with very conservative measurements assuming some next level compression.</p>

<p>I can guarantee they are not STORING this information (because that would be stupid, if they could do it... they wouldn&#39;t be that stupid), maybe processing it (all though that is a magnificent feat on its own, it is viable.), but storing that, plus the shit we know they store, gets silly.</p>

<p>Plus just from the viewpoint of someone who would want to capture that much information, Processing the relevant shit through the sea of worthless data would be counterproductive, If i wanted to keep tabs on all of america I would not store their calls. I would store the data of the call sure, The length, all parties involved. Probably a snippet upon recognition of keywords... but not the call. </p>

<p>All of this to say, if the title is your own, its tinged with a bit of cognitive bias. If the title is a quote, it has ruined credibility.</p>

<p>Personally I&#39;m against what the government takes its liberties to store on me, but I am also against misleading information.</p>

<p>Note: I am NOT saying they don&#39;t store calls, just not 80% of all calls.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The NSA&#39;s Utah Data Center will be able to handle and process five zettabytes of data, according to William Binney, a former NSA technical director.</p>

<p>...If Kahle’s estimations and assumptions are correct, the facility could hold...12 exabytes.</p>

<p>...a few thousand servers and a couple Exabytes of storage.</p>

<p>...The potential amount of information that could be housed in Bluffdale is truly staggering. ... Before yottabytes of data...can begin piling up inside the servers of the NSA’s new center, they must be collected. [So] the agency has undergone the largest building boom in its history.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The person who would actually know what the capacity is would be Binney and he says 5 Zetabytes. I&#39;m sure they transcribe the calls to text. Wouldn&#39;t this lower the amount of storage needed? This also assumes the Utah center is the only place the NSA stores information. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>12 Exabytes for a facility that large is reasonable, the 5 Zetabyte figure is outlandish though. You can only store so much data on a platter, and you can only filter but so much heat out of a building. The physical limitations become astounding if you expect their ISO to be competent enough to want a raid setup, For something like this I would go with <a href="http://www.techrepublic.com/blog/the-enterprise-cloud/raid-50-offers-a-balance-of-performance-storage-capacity-and-data-integrity/">Raid 50</a>, but <a href="https://www.dcig.com/2011/12/raid5-raid6-rain6-data-integrity-for-enterpri.html">Raid 6</a> would work as well. Now we go from just being able to house the absolutely massive amount of 5 Zetabytes, to the hardware to technically hold 8, 10, or 20... All in the same building? Only if this thing goes Umbrella Corp levels deep... </p>

<p>But yes, the 12 Exabyte number is staggering enough to make it believable that they could technically process each call (Again We are asking for an equally astounding processing center to do this, but it is not an unreasonable assumption for the government), run it through a recognition software, then more permanently store relevant transcribed information, and irrelevant but useful metadata. If done in this way it would be smart, and be capable of holding more than enough data well enough into the facilities own obsolete date (~20 years not accounting for population growth).</p>

<p>I guess taking this into account your title would have been overly verbose to say 80% of calls are recorded and processed, most with their content being stored, Not just metadata.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, I gave generous estimates for advanced/Super expensive tech... You can&#39;t really expect much for an extremely wide variety of logical reasons. </p>

<ol>
<li>Someone has to design this hardware. Unlike the weapons industry, tech is very broad and profitable and if you could substantially surpass available tech you would not be working for the government. I can see how you could assume this, given that the finances for these area&#39;s of government are not publicly available. </li>
<li>There is only so much that can happen in a world where physics rules. We could at maximum assume the government has working quantum processors, but so long as they are still working in binary, they can only reach a certain level. To go so far as to assume they are not, you would need need to make absolutely fantastic leaps for every other piece of hardware to make computing functional again, and even further for it to be backwards compatible. </li>
<li>After analysis, you can only make but so many fantastical claims before you start to journey into an area beyond science fiction.</li>
<li>If the government did have this ability, why is our government capable of being hacked.</li>
<li>Cost, Since I feel i have made it very clear tech is not that advanced you need to look at cost, for what I proposed (Which is enormous by the way and more than capable of doing all the nefarious things we believe they do) At a laughable discount the hard drives alone would cost upwards of 300m for the 12 exabytes.     almost in raw material cost, (No clue who would sell the government shit that low because if I was a business I would be more concerned with the bottom line) but at a reasonable &quot;Bulk Discount&quot; it would be 500M... If they did not care about data integrity. </li>
</ol>

<p>Your most valid point is we do not know how many of these data centers they have, But they could probably get away with only 1 per 250M people monitored.</p>

<p>If we root our assumptions of the government in fallacy we will never understand their movements. If we stop and reasonably think about their goals and limitations, we can more accurately predict/understand events.</p>

<p>Can you explain? If the NSA has secret data storage technology, why would they share that with other agencies who have been hacked? It would no longer be secret. Also, how would advanced data storage make them impenetrable to hacks? </p>

<p>I&#39;m not aware of cases where the NSA was hacked, although I guess it has probably happened. Can you point me to a case? I thought they were hacked after this story, but it was an NSA agent who was actually responsible:</p>

<p>NBC News: Were Russians Involved in NSA Hack? <a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/were-russians-involved-nsa-hack-n632666">http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/were-russians-involved-nsa-hack-n632666</a></p>

<p>What actually happened: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The U.S. government reportedly has still not developed full confidence on the identity of the &quot;Shadow Brokers&quot; hackers. Suspicion has fallen on the Russian government, but in October the FBI arrested a Maryland man who worked for Booz Allen Hamilton and had previously worked at the NSA’s Tailored Access Operations, a unit that carries out hacking operations around the world to obtain foreign intelligence on spies, terrorists and other targets. The firm’s former employee, Harold T. Martin III, has been charged with theft of government property and violating the Espionage Act by retaining classified material. He pleaded not guilty in February and awaits trial.</p>

<p>...If Kahle’s estimations and assumptions are correct, the facility could hold...12 exabytes.</p>

<p>...a few thousand servers and a couple Exabytes of storage.</p>

<p>...The potential amount of information that could be housed in Bluffdale is truly staggering. ... Before yottabytes of data...can begin piling up inside the servers of the NSA’s new center, they must be collected. [So] the agency has undergone the largest building boom in its history.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The person who would actually know what the capacity is would be Binney and he says 5 Zetabytes. I&#39;m sure they transcribe the calls to text. Wouldn&#39;t this lower the amount of storage needed? This also assumes the Utah center is the only place the NSA stores information. </p>
