        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Two witnesses told the team they saw George H. W. Bush and George W. Bush at the Essex County, New Jersey airport with Israeli Mossad agent Michael Harari, (Research Michael Harari. He may also have been the Mastermind of the 911 Slaughter) and another Mossad agent who were both seen standing next to JFK Jr.’s Cessna, all four were at the airport just two days before the doomed plane took off with JFK, Jr., his pregnant wife and her sister.</p>

<p>Several witnesses testified they overheard the murder plot being discussed in the White House oval office.  One ‘company’ (CIA) witness at the scene saw the bodies and the damaged plane and told the team a mid-air explosion caused the crash.</p>

<p>Approximately 150 witnesses gave individual depositions and signed statements for the final report.</p>

<p>Three flight instructors who worked with JFK Jr. testified he was an excellent pilot and had logged a huge number of flying hours since being licensed, he loved to fly and was that &quot;good.”</p>

Some really fun stuff there... mysterious 2nd gunman... &quot;Manchurian Candidate&quot; allegations of Sirhan Sirhan being brainwashed and programmed to assassinate. Plenty of use of the term &quot;conspiracy theory&quot;. Maybe the JFK Jr. stuff will be as exciting... I&#39;ll let ya know if I come across anything interesting. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>In the Michael Piper Collins book &quot;Final Judgement&quot; he states:</p>

<p>It appears Final Judgment has almost certainly pinpointed the identity of</p>

<p>the individual described by Pepper&#39;s source</p>

<p>In Final Judgment, Piper pointed out that the famous &quot;umbrella man&quot; who</p>

<p>was</p>

<p>photographed in Dealey Plaza in Dallas on Nov. 22, 1963 bore a remarkable</p>

<p>resemblance to no less than the now-infamous (but then shadowy) longtime</p>

<p>Mossad figure, Michael Harari.</p>

<p>In 1963, Harari was in the field as a top Mossad&#39;s assassinations</p>

<p>specialist and would have assuredly been in Dallas if, as Piper contends,</p>

<p>the</p>

<p>Mossad was a prime player in the JFK conspiracy</p>

<p>Harari’s career in false flag terrorism didn’t begin on September 11th, 2001. The Mossad kingpin reportedly played a key role in the 1976 Entebbe hijacking operation, the 1985 Achille Lauro incident, and other operations orchestrated by Israel but attributed to “Palestinian terrorists.” For details on these and other Israeli false flags, read Victor Ostrovsky’s By Way of Deception and Ari Ben-Menashe’s Profits of War.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Finished reading the JFK Jr. file... nothing about his death in there at all... mostly a kidnapping plot from 1995 and then some weird thing where Joe Biden got a death threat letter signed as John F. Kennedy Jr. accusing him of being a traitor and something about a &quot;crime bill&quot;... Always fun to get a surprise guest appearance by Joe Biden. </p>
