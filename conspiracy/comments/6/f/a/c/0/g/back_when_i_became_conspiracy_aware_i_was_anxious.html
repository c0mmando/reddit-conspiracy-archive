    <div class="md"><p>In order to be together, we must be ourselves.  Celebrate our differences!  Don&#39;t get rid of them or pretend they don&#39;t exist!  </p>

<p>I truly believe that one day we can achieve a one-world government.   Not some faceless, shapeless blob of emptiness as TPTB would have it, but one made up of individuals striving towards a common good. </p>

<p>Once you realize we are all one and the same, differences don&#39;t seem to matter that much anyway. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m a tragic optimist.  In my opinion we are undergoing a paradigm shift.  The current one has been exposed to be false to enough people and can no longer exist.  The light will continue to expose the dark regardless how we feel.  The Archons are frantically feeding for the last time.  The mofo&#39;s that hidden humanity&#39;s Divinity from itself time is over.  I sort of look at this time as the beginning stages of the final painful contractions before rebirth.  I don&#39;t think we can go into the next paradigm without facing the most darkest parts of ourselves and dealing with it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Am I really only one who thinks its populism?</p>

<p>Its the top percentage.</p>

<p>Listen, everything that you use as a label to put differences between us, EVERYTHING, be it religion, race, class, all of it is created to keep you in line.</p>

<p>Look we all know TPTB have literally no rules. Think of what that means for you. Imagine how you&#39;d live if you didn&#39;t fear death. Didn&#39;t fear consequences of retaliation for taking food from TPTB by ANY MEANS when you were hungry.</p>

<p>That&#39;s how they see the world. But if everyone could do anything they want then that small populist percentage would get wiped out.</p>

<p>So they put rules and morals and religions and governments to hold and tie you all down.</p>

<p>We are many. They are few. They fear the voice of freedom inside you. For they don&#39;t have power, I don&#39;t have power, its all of YOU that have the power.</p>
