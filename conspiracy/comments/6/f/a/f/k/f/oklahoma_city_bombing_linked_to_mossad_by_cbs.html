        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">155</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2017-06-04 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/astralrocker2001.html">astralrocker2001</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Before there was 9/11/2001, there was Oklahoma City, April, 1995.</p>

<p>Gunther Strassmeier, chief of staff to German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, has a son, Andreas, who was a German intelligence officer, spoke fluent Hebrew and has been married to an Israeli national. Andreas infiltrated the Elohim City, Oklahoma compound as their &quot;security director,&quot; and has been alleged to be the handler of Timothy McVeigh in his involvement to demolish the Murrah Federal Building. Oh, and did I mention that Gunther&#39;s daddy was a founding member of the German Nazi Party?</p>

<p>Why are there so many links, even to this day, between the Mossad and the Nazis?</p>

<p>What makes this story interesting is the fact that the Mossad has been linked to the 9/11 attack on US soil, not to mention that the Mossad has made itself famous by targeting the children of world leaders for its own hegemonic purposes. Married to an Israeli national? Has anyone outside of Israel actually tried to date an Israeli woman? Author Phillip Roth has a few vignettes along these lines that serve to highlight the fanatical nationalism of some of the more Zionist Israelis: it is hard to talk romance with someone who just wants to play with guns and knives. Anyone who has seen former Israeli stormtrooper Rahm Emmanuel with his Blackberry knows the meaning of the term, &quot;high strung.&quot; Rahm has spent considerable time working with the Israeli Defense Forces and, as just about everyone inside the Beltway knows, is a Mossad agent. If Emmanuel is not a Mossad agent, one has to wonder what one has to do to attract their attention.</p>

<p>The tidbit dropped into this vat of boiling oil by a former CBS News Investigative Reporter (who spoke on background because he was obviously drinking way too much vino while yukking it up with Wayne Madsen) was that the Murrah Building attack was originally intended to implicate Arabs living in the US and, ultimately, Saddam Hussein.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Was The Israeli Mossad involved in the Waco Massacre:</p>

<p>It is with a mixture of both sorrow and tear-stained anger that I present this information to you, my good friends and partners of Power of Prophecy. Those federal officials and agents guilty of the sickening bloodshed at Waco must be punished by State of Texas law enforcement and courts. We must cry out until they are. Until justice is done, we must never forget the admonition of Isaiah 59:14: &quot;And judgment is turned away backward, and justice standeth afar off: for truth is fallen in the street, and equity cannot enter.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Torch the Mother f...rs. Do it today!&quot; That was the direct order given Janet Reno’s Justice Department by Hillary Rodham Clinton from the East Wing of the White House. And so, on the morning of April 19, the day beginning the witches’ annual High Holy Days, on the 51st day of the siege, the combined forces of the FBI’s and the Army’s dreaded Delta Force Nightstalkers lit into the beleaguered men, women, and children held up inside their Branch Davidian church/home just outside Waco, Texas.</p>

<p>They ran wild, ravaging and slaughtering. Then, besotted by blood, their satanic lust and fury to kill satiated, the FBI and U.S. Army Nightstalker mass murderers took a few moments to stalk their lifeless prey, walking to and forth in the burning rubble, casting their jerky, nervous eyes to and fro over the smoldering ruins and the burnt and mutilated corpses of their seventy-six victims. Like cannibalistic savages, some took pictures of each other while pridefully holding in their hands the charred heads of their victims.</p>

<p>Gruesome Chain of Events
Power of Prophecy has received shocking information revealing some of the gruesome chain of events that transpired that awful, fateful day in Waco, Texas. We have learned, for example, that the initial, unlawful ATF attack on the innocent Branch Davidians was carried out not because of any crime that David Koresh or others had committed, but because of Koresh’s bold claim that he was the &quot;King of the Jews!&quot;
Leaders of powerful Jewish organizations with ties to the Clintons, the ATF, and the FBI were enraged by Koresh’s teachings that he was the new King David. They had learned from Israel’s Mossad spy agency that Koresh had spent months in Jerusalem seeking to recruit Israelis into his pseudo-Jewish religious sect. And when they were told by informants that Koresh and his people were flying an Israeli Star of David flag over their residence and church in Waco, they went ballistic.</p>

<p>The Jewish lobbyists called on their inside contact in the White House, Hillary Rodham Clinton. Hillary is herself Jewish—her grandmother, Della Rosenberg, spoke Yiddish to Hillary as a little girl, as reported in August 1999 in Forward, the influential Jewish newspaper. Hillary rapidly put things in motion, working at first through her ATF underlings at the Treasury Department, then later through her puppet at the Justice Department, Web Hubbell, Janet Reno’s corrupt deputy.</p>

<p>The Bradley was outfitted with a CS gas cannon. CS (mace tear gas) is highly flammable in certain concentrations)</p>

<p>There is also footage in this where the access the roof and enter through a window that is highly suspect. The IR footage from a helicopter while they moved down women and children fleeing the burning building is pretty sick as well. </p>

<p>Yes. I actually knew quite a few Israeli nationals and immigrants in college, and almost all dated American men/women. And I don&#39;t know of any of them having ties to Mossad. I&#39;m pretty sure most people from foreign countries are not connected to their intelligence agency. </p>

<p>Has anyone outside of Israel actually tried to date an Israeli woman? Author Phillip Roth has a few vignettes along these lines that serve to highlight the fanatical nationalism of some of the more Zionist Israelis: it is hard to talk romance with someone who just wants to play with guns and knives.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The passage is not saying nobody has dated Israelis, It is saying that those that have dated Israelis have remarked how fanatical the Israelis were.</p>

<p>Prosecutors asked the Federal judge in the Oklahoma City bombing trial yesterday to deny the request of one defendant, Timothy J. McVeigh, to give a series of television and newspaper interviews next month.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Whether you wish to admit it or not, when you approve, morally, of the bombing of foreign targets by the U.S. military, you are approving of acts morally equivalent to the bombing in Oklahoma City. The only difference is that this nation is not going to see any foreign casualties appear on the cover of Newsweek magazine.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Borrowing a page from U.S. foreign policy, I decided to send a message to a government that was becoming increasingly hostile, by bombing a government building and the government employees within that building who represent that government. Bombing the Murrah Federal Building was morally and strategically equivalent to the U.S. hitting a government building in Serbia, Iraq, or other nations. </p>

<p>&quot;Why? McVeigh told us at eloquent length, but our rulers and their media preferred to depict him as a sadistic, crazed monster ... who had done it for the kicks&quot;.</p>
