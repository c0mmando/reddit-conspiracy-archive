       The people are watching the FBI. Now would be a good time for the FBI to prove that it has regained control over its own rogue members and now serves the people instead of the Illuminati.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is time for the FBI to serve the people. No more excuses. It is time to arrest those who seek to destroy humanity for self gain. We all know who many of them are. Sample names below:
      </p>
      <p>
       John McCain
      </p>
      <p>
       John Podesta
      </p>
      <p>
       Hillary Clinton
      </p>
      <p>
       Bill Clinton
      </p>
      <p>
       George W Bush
      </p>
      <p>
       Anderson Cooper
      </p>
      <p>
       George Soros
      </p>
      <p>
       Alex Soros
      </p>
      <p>
       Lindsey Graham
      </p>
      <p>
       Anthony Weiner

       Sadly, these rogue elements within the US have committed treason and must be apprehended immediately. Every single day they are allowed to be free is a day they conspire against us. These are the most dangerous people in the world and they hold massive amounts of power granted to them by the positions they hold. We allowed them to hold these positions because they tricked us into thinking they would serve us. We were fooled. Instead of serving us, these rogue elements attempted to destroy all of humanity and has caused untold amounts of suffering around the world. Some of their crimes include:
      </p>
      <p>
       Genocide
      </p>
      <p>
       Pedophelia
      </p>
      <p>
       Kindnapping
      </p>
      <p>
       Racketeering
      </p>
      <p>
       Espionage
      </p>
      <p>
       Treason
      </p>
      <p>
       Grand theft on the trillion dollar scale
      </p>
      <p>
       Murder
      </p>
      <p>
       There are 300 million in the US and 7 billion across the globe hoping to God the FBI steps up bravely to the plate and does the right thing. If the leadership of the FBI cannot muster up the courage to enforce the law, then they should step down and allow one with the courage to do it.
      </p>
      <p>
       We the people demand that the FBI green lights the mass arrests now. We want these satanic pedos away from our politics and even further away from our children. We will not wait another few months. We want these arrest to happen this week. If you do not comply, we will assume you are still a rogue agency and proceed towards a plan B. The CIA is done but the FBI still has a chance to survive even though Comey and his rogue minions shit all over your reputations. The correct thing to do here is to listen to the people and realign yourselves with Justice and peace or face certain annihilation when the people create a suitable replacement for the FBI that actually functions as it is intended to.

       I'd like to think that FBI has been making good progress... I expected something bigger out of them by now though... but I'm just impatient for justice. I know that when you are putting together a case that will go up against literally the best lawyers in the entire world you have to make sure you have all your ducks in a row before you show your hand.

       Before 9-11, I'd hear about the FBI busting politicians with bribery entrapment stings from the local level on up. Since then and the creation of the JTTF, they don't seem to put much into taking down crooked politicians like they used to.

       I'm sure there is a political cartoon somewhere detailing this exact scenario... if there isn't... there should be... FBI with it's silly magnifying glass looking at a makeshift terrorist with the big banker and the politician pointing at the criminal from on top of their big pile of money. "Get him!"

       They always make excuses to buy time but when they arrest normal people, they never wait. We have enough evidence and we are private citizens. Imagine how much evidence the FBI has. MUCH MORE!

      <p>
       Anderson Cooper is a CIA agent that is working with the Illuminati to spread fake news and trick an entire population of Americans. This is treason.

       It's pretty telling when 2 or 3 of you get together and  pretend to have a rational conversation in a sub when you are all tagged as denizens of /the_dumpsterfire

       Everyone needs to arm themselves with the knowledge of where this BS comes from, personally I use 25 posts in 30 days in /The_dumpsterfire to tag people.

       Apparently having once worked for the CIA makes you a permanent tool for them.

       I personally think this is BS because my old navy buddy used to work for the CIA and he was let go and he couldn't get re-hired no matter how hard he tried, and he would have done anything for them.

       Pretty much it's what it seems like.  I pretty much only know John Podesta from reading about Pizzagate.  But seriously you can take an email about a pizza handkerchief to the FBI and expect people to be arrested.  But it's all the evidence they need on this sub.

       Right, because Comey was holding them back and other than him the FBI is full of people serving the people and taking down the powers that be.
      </p>
      <p>
       The FBI has always been, and still is, the tool of the elite.  Comey leaving didn't change that.  Trump getting elected didn't change that.

       Like a charm once enough people willfully organize, cooperate, and orchestrate these events. It can happen tomorrow but it should happen by people around major government building.

       These massive and corrupt organizations need to be hit hard over and over again and it can all be done peacefully.
      </p>
      <p>
       Imagine if life is a video game where you get a bunch of humans who have to drive out corrupt politicians peacefully. All you have to do is use your imagination and keep a nonstop flow of various strategies over and over and over again until most of them fall out of politics.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just imagine the look in John Mccains face if he had people calling him an Illuminati shill every single time he walked in or out of a government building while on camera. Then imagine the look on his face when all he sees on YouTube are people calling him a traitor in multiple videos with sleepers learning as to why he is courrpt. Eventually the kitchen will get too hot and McCain falls off.

       Nobody is changing anything but the name and face who runs the FBI. Nobody wants a efficient FBI as such a beast would have them in jail by end of day. Comey will be replaced but TPTB by another automaton who does the same political ass licking that Comey did, but this time for them and not others.

       Gee, it's almost like the whole thing was a sham and you've been played like a fiddle by people who have you convinced that
       <em>
        everything

       is a plot against you. The hit list there is just so coincidentally exactly the list it alt-right boogeymen.

       You can't arrest a sitting president before he is impeached.

       The rest of his russian connections are soon to be arrested and prosecuted, regardless of the fact that The Chump has attempted to dismantle the entire justice system by firing all the old prosecutors and not hiring new ones to replace them.

       I like the token inclusion of W, but the complete lack of any of the real bloodthirsty warmongers from his administration.  Really makes this whole post pretty clear.
