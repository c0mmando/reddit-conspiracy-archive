       ...before flying to here in Australia. On his very first day after landing, sure enough, he got flu. And he passed it over to me and my wife. I mostly recovered in 2 days, thanks to home-made natural treatments, but my wife still feels down. We went to the GP today, and sure enough, the first thing the GP advised was to take the damn flu shots. You know, the same flu shot that didn't do shit on my in-law. Next, because the GP has to prescribe something, she prescribed an antibiotic. Before heading to the pharmacy to buy the antibiotic, I did a quick research and found out that antibiotics, as the name suggests, is meant to fight "against bacteria", and so, is irrelevant against flu which is a virus. WTH! Do they even know what they're doing ?
      </p>
      <p>
       It's as if GPs had become sales people paid to prescribe panadol and vaccines. (yep, she also suggested to take the usual panadol). The diagnostic by the GPs I have consulted over the years are very often that which I was advised today.
      </p>
      <p>
       Flu vaccines are heavily promoted these days, including on the television, and are given for free. In my own world, however, nothing is free, so if this flu vaccine is given for free, this raises questions to me.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, do your own research about flu vaccines folks, and check about what can keep you safe from being hit by flu. The best treatment against flu is preventive, and it involves hygiene, good rest, and a proper diet.

       I don't get the obsession with the flu. It takes you down for a couple days, big deal. It is only fatal in people who are already old, infirm, or compromised. It is the most blatant money grab by big pharma, and nearly useless if you take care of yourself.

        On December 9, 2016, CDC posted estimates of seasonal flu deaths from more recent seasons in the United States. CDC estimates that from 2010-2011 to 2013-2014, influenza-associated deaths in the United States ranged from a low of 12,000 (during 2011-2012) to a high of 56,000 (during 2012-2013). Death certificate data and weekly influenza virus surveillance information was used to estimate how many flu-related deaths occurred among people whose underlying cause of death on their death certificate included respiratory or circulatory causes.

        Those who do not are much more likely to be those with compromised immune systems who develop flu-related complications, like pneumonia or bronchitis. Most deaths attributed to the flu are actually due to bacterial pneumonia, and these days, bacterial pneumonia can be effectively treated with advanced medical care and therapies

       People who die do not die from the flu itself. Myself, my wife, and my in-law are the anecdotal living proofs you don't necessarily die following a flu infection. Like I said, I mostly recovered in 2 days. Still coughing after 4 days, but I'm back to doing all work tasks I have to do.

       Yeah, I'm not arguing that most people are able to recover from the flu. But the reality is thousands of people do die from complications that are a direct result from the flu.

      <p>
       Look, my GP made a diagnostic without evidence I had the actual influenza. Why would I assume that all GPs, except the one I consulted, include a flu swab in their consultation ?
      </p>
      <p>
       So, when the data comes from the CDC, although there is evidence patients don't get a flu swab for each and every case reported, it's the truth. When It's from a patient, patient has no idea what he's talking about, and so it's probably wrong. This is fantastic.
      </p>
      <p>
       I had all the symptoms of flu.
      </p>
      <p>
       The doctor prescribed something based on the assumption I had flu. Or, she's too lazy (or incompetent) to do her work well (unless it's due to the costs involved), because as you said, no flu swab. So, that's maybe where the problem is to start with : why don't they include the flu swab for every patient that shows the symptoms of flu ? But, wait. If we do so, the truth may come up : there are not as many cases of actual influenza.
      </p>
      <p>
       If I have a STD for example, the doctor will get a sample from me, and send it for analysis to a laboratory, before prescribing anything. But, for flu, nothing. This doesn't sound right, does it ?
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, you're right. It may not be the actual influenza virus since I didn't get a flu swab :
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Only about 20 percent of all influenza-like illness that occurs every year is actually associated with influenza viruses because many types of respiratory illnesses with flu-like symptoms can be mistaken for influenza. About 80 percent of cases of suspected influenza sent to the CDC for analysis lab test negative for type A or type B influenza.
       </p>
       <p>
        What is also not widely shared is the fact that "most people who get influenza will recover in a few days to less than two weeks" (this is a direct quote from the CDC)
       </p>
       <p>
        The reality is the vast majority of deaths officially due to influenza are actually due to pneumonia -- not flu -- which likely accounts for only a few hundred. Yet the CDC continues to use tens of thousands as a scare tactic to drive people towards flu shots
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       So, what about the CDC and their reported flu figures ? there is an 80% margin here between actual flu and influenza-like illness. Could the CDC inflate the numbers to push the "everyone has to get his flu shot" agenda ?

       yeah I'm not sure why they didn't swab you. I work in a hospital setting and ANY patient who I admit with flu-like symptoms gets a flu swab. It's important to know for treatment (bacterial/viral), and so you can avoid spreading it to other people.
      </p>
      <p>
       The reason the CDC pushes the vaccines is because, like you said, most people will get over the flu in a couple of weeks, but there are people out there who it would be really dangerous for. Not to mention people who can't get vaccinated because of allergies and or autoimmune disorders. Vaccinating will help reduce the spread of the virus, especially to people with pre-existing chronic respiratory or circulatory disease.

       I know these statements aren't going to win me any popularity contests in this sub, but it's been my honest experience as a nurse.

       They only put aluminum in the dead virus vaccines. If his FIL caught the flu from the vaccine, then it would have had to been a live virus, therefore no aluminum.

       The Patent # is 9,597,389 (or related, there's a couple related to this one) and it can contain also contain thiomersal depending on the distribution method - as I understand most pharmacies in Australia use the multidose containers, so it would contain thiomersal.

       I never have the vaccine and I end up with a flu every 3-4 years, whereas the people at work who get it always seem to end up with it. Anecdotal, I know - I'm not a scientist!

       Well the reason that people get "the flu" after the vaccine that uses a dead virus is because it's poisoning. The symptoms of the flu are not very different than the symptoms of poisoning.
      </p>
      <p>
       The previous commenter suggested that his FILs "flu" was contagious, which means it was a live virus. The people at your workplace aren't contagious, they are poisoned.

       RDA for vitamin c is roughly 80mg when our bodies need roughly 2g to detoxify from all the chemicals we encounter during the day. This isn't even to fully support the immune system or to kill viruses and bacteria that enter the body. I started the vitamin c treatment when I was sick maybe 6 months ago. I took up to 12 g a day and it knocked out right out. Vitamin c is one of the safest compounds in the world. It is impossible to over dose. The only side effect is diarrhea. This only happens when your body is fully saturated with it and cannot absorb more. Fortunately there are variations of it that allow the body to absorb more. Liposimal vitamin c is 80% bioavailabe. Sodium ascorbate is roughly half as available and ascorbic acid is half that.

       VC has proven to cure everything from the common cold, to cancer, to sepsis, to radiation poisoning, to whooping cough, to snake bites. The only catch is the right dosage has to be given, which basically requires intravenous for the more serious ailments.

       My point was you need to up your magnesium as well. Your body needs it to synthesize the vit c. Without it you piss and shit it out, as you mentioned.

       Actually old age is caused by our bodies ability to do this action. Skin becomes less elastic and organs don't detoxify as efficiently.

       Not sure where in Australia you live, but where I'm from it's bloody hard to get antibiotics. The doctor really makes sure your immune system is stressed and it's not viral. The opposite of a "big pharma" conspiracy.

       The influenza virus is one of the most mutable pathogens we know. You'll find that flu vaccines have to be designed differently every year because the virus mutates.

       Prescribing antibiotics in viral infections (when there is no secondary bacterial infections) is not just stupid, but a medical mistake, too.

       flu shot manufacturers look at the previous season's most active strains of flu and then base the current years vaccine on that data. The flu virus does mutate quickly, but it's not the reason the vaccine is updated yearly. It's largely a guessing game

       Absolutely. In fact, most viruses do mutate. THat's why vaccinating doesn't make much sense. It's a never ending race after the new mutated version of the virus. Today GSK and sanofi have a quadrivalent solution (4 vaccines in 1). One day, we will have a 20-valent vaccine. Maybe 50-valent vaccine. How good can that be to inject all this shit into your body ?

       How do you know your dad got the flu? Did he have a flu swab done that came back positive? How long was it between when your dad got the shot and got sick? It takes up to two weeks for your body to produce the antibodies required.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's absolutely possible to get a flu-shot and still get sick. Flu vaccines protect against 4 of the most active flu strains from the previous season. There are around 20 different influenza strains, there are also around 200 organisms that cause flu-like symptoms. Did your doctor do a flu swab? If so, did it come back negative? You can have a bacterial infection that causes flu-like symptoms so it's not unreasonable to have an antibiotic prescribed. Was a culture and sensitivity done?

       If your immune system works well (you're not of old age, you're not immunocomoromised, you don't have any current serious illness, etc.) and you get a flu, you have to just pass it. Analgesics, antipyretics if necessary, good hydration, tons of vitamins (that you should be taking daily anyway, best if it is from food itself and not tablets) and rest.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why the hell would you get a shot for 3 days of potential dyscomfort. Let your body do the things it's been training for during millions of years of evolution.

       I believe my immune system works well. I don't even remember when was the last time I got sick. It could be 10 years.
      </p>
      <p>
       My approach has been the natural way : drink lots of water, sleep, thyme infusions, hot water with squeezed lemon juice, sleep, vitamin C supplements, vitamin D supplements, sleep, gargling water with salt, limit sugar intakes, feed mostly on fruits and veggies.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would add : don't underestimate the power of sleep. Just sleeping can do so much good to improve health condition.
