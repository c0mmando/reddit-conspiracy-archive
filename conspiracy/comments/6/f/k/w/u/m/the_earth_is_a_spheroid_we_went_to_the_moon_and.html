    <div class="md"><h2>History of geodesy</h2>

<p>Geodesy (/dʒiːˈɒdɨsi/), also named geodetics, is the scientific discipline that deals with the measurement and representation of the Earth. The history of geodesy began in antiquity and blossomed during the Age of Enlightenment.</p>

<p>Early ideas about the figure of the Earth held the Earth to be flat (see flat Earth), and the heavens a physical dome spanning over it. Two early arguments for a spherical Earth were that lunar eclipses were seen as circular shadows which could only be caused by a spherical Earth, and that Polaris is seen lower in the sky as one travels South.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Plato&#39;s figure was a guess and Archimedes&#39; a more conservative approximation.&quot;</p>

<p>The techniques they used to &quot;calculate&quot; the circumference of the Earth was based on the assumption the Earth was a sphere. They used sticks, shadows and the light of the Sun to calculate the circumference of the Earth, on the assumption the Earth was a sphere.</p>

<p>That doesn&#39;t <em>prove</em> the earth is a sphere, it proves that <strong>if the Earth were a sphere</strong> it would be about 25,000 in circumference.</p>

<p>His calculations are correct, but they are <strong>based</strong> on the assumption the Earth is a sphere, and the Sun is really far away, as illustrated in the picture. Just because he managed to pull out some numbers doesn&#39;t make the assumption correct.</p>

<p>Think about this... There is multiple ancient calenders around the whole world, each one calculating out something different. If objects weren&#39;t round, how do these calculations hold up to this very day? Why does the sun rise and fall once each throughout the year?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re asking me to explain things that are really basic within the flat earth community. U can type in all those questions to google, and find respective anwsers.</p>

<p>I think we can safely assume you <strong>believe</strong> the Earth to be round, which is fine. The only way you&#39;re going from <strong>believing</strong> to knowing is by doing research. If you keep researching the mainstream, they&#39;ll keep telling you the Earth is round, like they will also tell you Global Warming is real, the illuminati don&#39;t exist, false flags don&#39;t happen (Syria gas), 9/11 was Bin Laden, ...</p>

<p>Untill you are ready to give up the <strong>belief</strong> Earth is ball, and start from scratch (I don&#39;t <strong>know</strong> the shape of the earth), you&#39;ll always look at any material through the lens of the mainstream.</p>

<p>You&#39;ll accept flawed wiki pages (like the one you listed) as proof for a round Earth, because it has to be. I can&#39;t change that, only you can.</p>

<p>You are claiming FE which means the shape of Earth is flat, but ancient cultures created calenders so they knew their position not only in our solar system but in our galaxy. FE doesn&#39;t seem to link to any of that at all.</p>

<p>As for the wiki pages, how is a page on a mathematician fake? Oh right, anything proving a globular earth is fake, isn&#39;t it?</p>

<p><a href="https://1888.org/images/2015/12/16/20430/ae-equidistant-projection-flat-earth.png">Antarctica is a large icewall that holds all the water in.</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why is there a high and low point of the sun yearly?</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R52_PdZlSq8">Because seasons exist on a flat earth aswell.</a></p>

<p>During our (northern hemisphere) summer, the Sun circles closest around the Northpole and will <em>appear</em> higher in the sky for the northern continents. Reveresed for winter.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why does the moon wax and wane?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There isn&#39;t a clean-cut anwser for this. It&#39;s one of the few things U <strong>can</strong> hold against the flat earth (phases of the moon, exact explanation).</p>

<p>Personally, instead of holding it against the FE, I believe it to be one of the main arguements for a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXe49AtDZS4">concave earth</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why are the constillations slightly different in Australia than in Europe?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Same anwser as previous question; the flat earth model isn&#39;t perfect yet.</p>

<p>Like I said previously, <strong>it&#39;s not about believing the earth is flat, it&#39;s about knowing there&#39;s severe issues with the round earth</strong>. I&#39;m not going say (with 100% certainty) it&#39;s flat. I&#39;m doubting between flat or concave, but definitely not convex (round).</p>

<p>There&#39;s too much issues with the round Earth, as explained by thousands and thousands of flat earthers.</p>

<td align="left">Description</td>
<td align="left">I&#39;ve read quite a bit about how the sun and moon allegedly moved in the Flat Earth model, but I really needed to visualize how the 4 seasons worked. So, I got creative with the free software, Stellarium. Now, it should be noted that the programming for Stellarium is based on the heliocentric globe model, however I figured out how to essentially manipulate it in order to show the rotations of the sun and moon over a Flat Earth. What REALLY intrigued me was how the sun literally speeds up and slows down depending on what path it is on during a particular point in the year. I sped the whole animation up (more than 500x) for the sake of time (otherwise, the video would be over an hour long), but other than that, I did not manually adjust the speeds for each season nor do any other (motion) manipulation at all. What you see here is exactly what the software rendered, just overlaid on top of the Flat Earth map. Toward the end, you will see how January and June syncs up day for day perfectly, with a faster sun going around the outer rim and a slower sun moving in the tighter northern circuit.  I based my change of seasons titling as follows...  Spring - starting March 1 and ending May 31, Summer - starting June 1 and ending August 31, Fall (autumn) - starting September 1 and ending November 30, and Winter - starting December 1 and ending February 28  Note: I didn&#39;t have time to mess around with day and night as part of this animation. It&#39;s just meant to show the seasons and moon phases throughout the year as the sun and moon move above the &quot;circle of the earth.&quot; I hope you find this as fascinating as I did.</td>

<p>Ancient cultures didn&#39;t know our position in the galaxy, they knew about the Sun, the Moon and planets, because those are visible with the naked eye. (Perhaps they had primitive telescopes, I don&#39;t know) To make the claim they knew about the Milky Way, clusters of galaxies, the observable universe, etc.. is ridiculous.</p>

<p>I just explained to you a pretty big flaw on that wiki page just 2 posts ago. What wiki presents as <strong>proof</strong> the Earth is a sphere, is merely a calculation of a circumference based on the <strong>assumption</strong> the Earth is a sphere.</p>

<p>If U can&#39;t even see that, there&#39;s no point throwing any arguement at you. I can point back to my previous point where I said: &quot;If you&#39;re not willing to give up your belief the Earth is round, it will forever be round if you cherry pick your sources (aka mainstream)&quot;</p>

<p>They didn&#39;t. They had some astronomical knowledge, I can point to all the megalithic structures that have been aligned with certain stars for this, and I&#39;m not going to deny this. Your claim that they knew the universe to be what you currently <em>believe</em> it is is false. </p>

<p>As for GW. Burning fuels that give off gases into the atmosphere will have an effect on the speed of climate change. It&#39;s very simple. Yes science is trying to rectify our 100+ years of adding into the natural cycle but it doesn&#39;t mean that we haven&#39;t added to that. Look at the transport, factories, farmed animals and fires world wide. We are pushing more and more chemicals into the air. How people can think that us doing that does not speed up a process is beyond me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Provide evidence for all of your claims that FE is a psyop or get the fuck out. I&#39;m so sick of that regurgitated line which nobody has the proof to back. Don&#39;t talk to me about telescopes or shitty thought experiments about how I&#39;m retarded and somehow didn&#39;t go to the same public education system as you, just provide the evidence that it&#39;s a CIA psyop or admit that you&#39;re just pulling shit straight from your ass.</p>
