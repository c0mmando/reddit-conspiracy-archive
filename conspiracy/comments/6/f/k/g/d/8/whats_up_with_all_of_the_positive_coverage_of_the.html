       Picking my battles with that one. To have that opinion in the face of the numbers is to have an opinion clouded by emotion. Can't argue with the math, Bush was far more sinister in his agenda.

       I was thinking it could be something like they are testing outcomes of various types of psychological manipulation via social media. Like with the Biden Bro junk. What is the best possible way to change or increase the likelihood of positive public perception of a political figure? My hunch is they are doing trial and error and recording the data to nail down the best way to promote their candidates in upcoming elections.

       Yeah that's true. I have noticed the sudden big push. Maybe you're correct. Or it could be they're wrapping up the Biden trial and now is the beginning stages of the Bush Bro test run. It will be interesting to see it evolve either way.

       It seems like they've been at it with the bushes for a while now. I'd say around 2 months? A slow trickle of TIL's and front page posts of them being cute. Plus Bush 1 at the superbowl. And now the post about him saving aviators on a submarine. It'll certainly be interesting to see how it plays out.

       GHWB led Operation 40 and supervised killing JFK, he facilitated removing Nixon, he attempted to have Reagan assassinated in coup #3 but took over anyhow, he smuggled drugs with Clinton during Iran-Contra.  Over his career he lost elections over and over and over again, but the Rockefellers and his father placed him in positions of great power.  His father, Prescott, attempted to buy Smedley Butler to create war for profit, when that failed they moved on to a performer known as Adolf Hitler and gave him $32,000,000.  GHWB's father-in-law was Aleister Crowley.  When initiated into Skull and Bones he chose the biblical name Magog.  Why are there always so many similar topics that run each day on Reddit, is it part of the planned narrative?

       Pierce was who Barbara's mother married.  She had an affair with Mr Crowley and followed his cult.  It's in the book The Illusion of Democracy with sources cited.

       The simplest explanation is that they're trying to craft a narrative of Trump being the worst president of all time even though W is far worse. He's responsible for hundreds of thousands if not millions of deaths and the destabilization of an entire region.

       I'd say Sr. is close to passing and they want a big, positive media coverage campaign of the following days after death while reflecting on the "multiple great achievements" he had a hand in through out his life.

       All I can think is they're trying to clear the air so George P Bush (Jeb's son) can make a run for higher office than Texas Land Commissioner.  TBH, I have a hunch (without much evidence, mind you) that he's gonna be on the republican presidential ticket in 2024.  Imagine how the Republicans would foam at the mouth for a Bush that might pull the hispanic vote (George P's mother is hispanic).
