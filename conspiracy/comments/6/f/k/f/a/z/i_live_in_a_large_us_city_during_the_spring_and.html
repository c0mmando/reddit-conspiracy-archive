        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>My first assumption was that these people are likely drug addicts and or are the same &quot;homeless&quot; people I notice downtown asking for change in the bar district area but after seeing them in action and using my people watching skills I began to notice some key differences between &quot;downtown bums&quot; and &quot;roadway panhandlers&quot;.  I also noticed that all of the roadway panhandlers seem to display many of the same characteristics and behavior.</p>

<p>They do not speak, do not smile, and avoid direct eye contact.  They communicate with their patrons exclusively through hand gesturing i.e thumbs up, waving always keeping their hands below their shoulders, and also head nods, and I&#39;ve noticed winks.</p>

<p>They are all &quot;white&quot;, with only a very few women.  All also appear to be ethnically nondescript for example no obvious Italians or other darker skinned and haired Anglo types.  Everyone is of an average height and weight as well.</p>

<p>The cloths they wear seem to be purposefully nondescript as well absolutely no branding present on shirts and jackets not even small logos on the chest.  I have also noticed that I have never seen any wearing Levi&#39;s Jeans which I love personably and always look to see if I can determine what type of jeans people are wearing.  The standard dress seems to be light jeans, brown 4 eye boots rarely sneakers or combat or work style boots then heavy colored t-shirts or long sleeved shirts, with a denim or flannel jacket.  Ball Hats only if it&#39;s raining and winter hats if it&#39;s cold.  Never hoods over their heads and they do not wear sunglasses.  The do not wear rings, watches, or brackets.</p>

<p>Most seem to be middle aged with only a few men I have noticed who look to be in their early thirties.  It&#39;s seems that 40-55 or so is the overwhelming majority of ages.</p>

<p>For the most part they have a clean cut appearance most men are clean shaven.  The haircut is nothing of note but seems to be fairly well kept no hair hanging over ears and etc.  The few women do not have hair hanging over their faces and also wear no makeup whatsoever.  They do not have dreads.</p>

<p>These people are clearly not Hippie Types or Gutter Punks.  Even though they do not make eye contact, they do have clear eyes.  They are not stoned or drunk.  They do not stagger and they do not slouch, for people who are standing on their feet all day long they have surprisingly upright posture.  They also appear to be well rested? they don&#39;t have dead tired eyes.  Even though they are very reserved with their behavior it is clear; they have energy and are alert.  They have a deep tan, with  weathered faces and clear completions that suggests to me they spend time in a sunny and dry climate I feel like the Southwest would be the best bet as to where they are likely from or reside.</p>

<p>The &quot;Downtown Bums&quot; have a completely different approach they will engaged you in conversation many times at first pretending to strike up a conversation and then mention they lost their wallet or something to that effect.  There seem to be two different classes of the &quot;Downtown Bums&quot; one is of a completely disheveled broken down dirty person and then one who is dressed slightly less disheveled and somewhat clean looking but wearing clothes slightly too big and many layers no matter the season. </p>

<p>I believe these people may be members of a cult and are possibly fulfilling some type of an initiation by taking part in the panhandling.  This could be something of a training exercise to make certain the members have the drive, self control, and discipline to make it to the next step or role.  They act deliberately and maintain what appears to be a code of conduct.</p>

<p>EDIT:  Thanks for the feedback regarding this theory.  Over the next few weeks I&#39;ll attempt to further research something&#39;s and post an update regarding my findings.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You definitely might be on to something. </p>

<p>When I studied coups, I noticed that the mafia would team up with local criminals, who then went overseas to panhandle. Thus, I&#39;m certain that begging can be tied to gang activity...and sometimes sophisticated gangs at that. ATM skimming, webcams, etc. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know about being associated with cults, but I just bring this up to affirm that begging is not always as it seems. You are right that you might be observing a larger network at play. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve noticed that the (the ones I have noticed, of course not all) ones on the freeway exit ramps, after a days work, leave and go to their cars. The dress into proper attire, and leave in nice-ish cars.</p>

<p>You might well be onto something. I always thought they were in between jobs. But a cult makes more sense. The initiation could be like telling them to see how others react to selflessness. Or something. Nice idea.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They sound like vagabonds. We have them in my city too. They travel to were there is work and they follow the seasons. They do have a somewhat of a community with rules and protocols to limit their interaction with law enforcement as many of them do not have identification and it is a misdemeanor to be out with out it in many cities. I don&#39;t think they are so much of a cult as much as a subculture. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is some awesome observation. I would posit that perhaps they are more like a gang than a cult. And that they are serving in some other capacity as they do this, as observers or middlemen in some kind of transactions thet are taking place out there at the wasteland in the middle of america. What kind of trafficking goes through those parts?</p>

<p>Any which way, I look forward to more from you about this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly, the classless have awakened. Panhandling does have it&#39;s advantages, especially as an off the grid money making method.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The town I live in has a facebook group &quot;You know you&#39;re from _____ when...&quot; in which the members gossip about local goings-ons, exchange old photos and memories of the place, a little political discussion. Some use it like a CB radio to discuss police calls and so on.</p>

<p>The members of the  fb group took it upon themselves to surveil the strip mall/exit ramp panhandlers. Turns out they do all have cars parked blocks away that they get into at the end of their &quot;shift.&quot; Discussion with one of the panhandlers turned up the info that they&#39;re averaging about $50,000 a year per person. Totally heresay, not sure how true that is, but interesting if it is.</p>

<p>Your description of the panhandlers is pretty dead on. I&#39;m going to have to look a little more closely to verify the details - your observation skills are keener than mine. But they all showed up about the same time a couple-few years ago. It&#39;s a fairly small town - there were no beggars prior. I thought that maybe there had been an ordinance change allowing that sort of thing and that&#39;s why they all showed up, but that really doesn&#39;t make a lot of sense - gov&#39;t rarely gives back latitude once it has taken it away.</p>

<p>Super interesting post. Why are you thinking initiation into cult rather than just organized gang trying to fund itself? Is it their demeanor that makes you think there&#39;s something other than hustling going on?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I live in a small city and I know our locals by sight and site, some by name. In the past month I&#39;ve noticed more of what I&#39;ve been calling &quot;Post-Grad Beggars&quot; and they fit the description you outline almost perfectly. They&#39;re not in the downtown, they don&#39;t sit at the exits of popular parking lots, and the only sign I&#39;ve seen any of them hold simply says &quot;Rough year, please help&quot; - our locals either have signs that say &quot;God Bless&quot; or &quot;Disabled Vet, anything helps&quot; or (my favorite) a man who makes shitty knick-knacks out of scavenged trash and sells them for &quot;Whatever you want to donate&quot;</p>

<p>I&#39;m gonna start paying more attention to the PGBs, see if I recognize any from last year. I did talk to a guy in that category last year, and he was a polite and intelligent man who was actually trying to raise enough cash to get the train to another city so he could make his impending court date on a shoplifting charge. I know he was legit because he was nervous enough about it that he&#39;d talked to our local PD about his situation and possible consequences. And I haven&#39;t seen him since. But some of these other guys look familiar, though nondescript. </p>
