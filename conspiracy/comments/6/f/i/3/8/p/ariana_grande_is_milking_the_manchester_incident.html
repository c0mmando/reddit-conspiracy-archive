<p>Ariana Grande cancels her tour under advice from the label thinking people would either not come to her concerts out of fear. In a effort to recoup her funds she takes advantage of the new found buzz by raising funds to do the things she pledged to do (pay for the funerals etc). Through her philantrophy, her album sales skyrocket making her more famous than she as ever been. She becomes the Celine Dion of England and is set for life in her career. Not to mention this kind of clears her from that incident where she claimed to hate America</p>

This concert was spammed all over the planet &amp; last I heard they raised a paultry 13 mil? That&#39;s jerry lewis telethon money. I would love to know the actual total brought in compared to charity paid out.</p>

<p>What? How is this helping the victims. Just seems like she is creating an atmosphere to create more victims while making some cash and signalling her virtue. </p>

<p>I think that vetting any immigrant/refugee is important. What is happening in Europe is insanity. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>And I thought all the money raised went to the victims.</p>

<p>I have no issues with vetting any immigrant/refugee. It takes on average over 3 years from once a person applies for refugee status before they are allowed in. If you noticed he is proposing a ban on immigrants of a certain religion from some countries. You will also notice that Qatar is not one of the countries on the ban but just recently had diplomatic ties cut by at least one of the country n the list. Qatar is our ally an has over 10,000 American military people stationed there. </p>

<p>What is happening in Europe is crazy but if you noticed most of the terrorist are citizens of the county or long time residents. The ones that have come from another country usually are not from countries that trump travel band would effect.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This thread is not about Trump. </p>

<p>Trump sucks ass and was just a bait and switch for Hillary Clinton.</p>

<p>Pop superstars are largely sold souls and whores that trade their body and soul for fame. Some do it from the heart, some start from the heart and lose their way, and some were in it for selfish reasons from the start. </p>

<p>Anytime a crisis happens pan handlers come running to collect the charitable donations, make tax write offs, and collect their administration fees. Charities are largely fucking scams designed to employ people that don&#39;t want to have to be at the mercy of the machine and would rather collect money and live off of the people that fuel the machine. </p>
