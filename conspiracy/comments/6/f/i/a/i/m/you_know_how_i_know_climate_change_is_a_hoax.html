    <div class="md"><p>It was a metallic-looking sphere about 10 feet in diameter that was being chased by a military jet within 10 minutes from Grand Forks Air Force Base in the 1980s. I could not tell if it made a noise because the jet made sounds but the sphere did not have any sort of emissions I could see and I do not think it made any sound. After they did a maneuver they both headed back toward Grand Forks which made me think they were both military vehicles. I am not aware of any sort of nuclear energy device small enough for that craft but other energy sources are certainly possible. Either way I am convinced that the military has developed energy and other technologies in the last 70 years that are far superior to what we know of. So if they really want to affect climate change, they need to disclose these technologies. It is really incredible when you consider that we are basically all using the same technologies that we had in 1950. Compare computers and phones to what we had in 1950 and you can begin to see where the actual energy and propulsion technologies should be in comparison.</p>

<p>Why does one  give you a guide to another? What is it particularly about phones and computers that means they have advanced more than energy and propulsion?</p>

<p>Seems like they have both advanced a lot.  It&#39;s not a great analogy anyway, because computers and <strong>modern</strong> phones did not really exist until the invention of the microprocessor. Modern phones are just computers, landlines still use the same tech as they did in the 50s</p>

<p>Tesla is famous because he invented AC power. If Edison wanted Tesla silenced, why the hell wouldn&#39;t he promote DC? Tat wouldve made him way more money. </p>

<p>Tesla wasn&#39;t silenced. He was an eccentric inventor who had good ideas but was also #wrong about some things, I don&#39;t know why people don&#39;t understand this. And just because he made lightbulbs light up without wires doesn&#39;t mean anything, gas can be ionized from far away using normal-ass antennas. </p>

<p>With the weaker field, we see that the gaps are larger. More ping pong balls can penetrate through the net.</p>

<p>The Earth&#39;s Geomagnetic Field has weakened drastically in the past 150 years and in fact, in the past 10-20 years its rate of decrease has increased 10 fold.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t necessarily believe that climate change as a whole is a hoax but I do believe they make a bigger deal out of it then needed. I believe it&#39;s a natural cycle the world goes through and if it was as important type is to change what we do as some say it is my bottle water would be from a spring in PA, sent to Cali to be bottle and then sent back to PA for me to buy it. That just seems like a huge waste of resources and a big no no for the environment and is just one example I can think of. If it was that big of a deal there would be some sort of legislation to stop things like that from happening.</p>
