       No nobody else ever thought of that before. I mean, it's not as if that's the primary reason they were long time Cold War surveillance devices made available to the public or anything like that.

       The Xbox kinect is more than a listening device. It can 3D model and entire room and an entire person. If you make a 3D model of a person and add the texture from the regular camera, and have their speech patters from recording them speech..... They can make a virtual you that can be added into any picture or video and animated to do and say anything they want. Basically CGI.  Here is a simple example from a hobbyist.

       No doubt advanced scanners can do this in the future. But that future is not now and the kinect is not that scanner. 
You should still disable it though, in the interest of personal data security.

       Also in the past the first models of the Playstation 3 had an hardware power I/O switch.

       This feature was omnitted on later models, which means they are in permanent standby/listening mode when plugged in, unless you have a Power strip with its own I/O switch

       I mean its not making a realistic CGI model, but if you were attempting to spy on somebody or maybe blackmail/frame them, and you had a rough layout of the entire house, a specific 3-d model of the room they are in, and hours of video and audio footage, what else do you need?

       No. Removing the headphone jack is a step towards future wireless devices (headphones in this case) and others are following suit. Similar to how they removed the CD reader in Macbooks ages ago. Noone considers that a bad decision now. Removing it may make a few people angry, but will not have impact on the company. There seems to have been near zero impact on sales.
      </p>
      <p>
       Security is a different ball park and Apple releases an annual 70 page white paper solely about security. If they deliberately lied about anything in that white paper or other security related claims, it would have damaging consequences to their shareholders and their reputation. Apple has tons of business customers who rely on their industry leading security measures.

       i bought an apple because i thought they were more secure, but that was an ill-informed decision. turns out apple has backdoors jus like all the rest. so, as a customer, you have a choice between apple backdoors or pc backdoors.

       There will always be backdoors, usually it takes user action to allow it though. And Apple is fast to respond to any backdoor with updates. If tou know how, you can test/fix the backdoors yourself.
      </p>
      <p>
       Linux is maybe even more secure, but you have to know what you're doing and it's not user-friendly (althoigh things are getting better).
      </p>
      <p>
       Overall, nothing is 100% secure unless you design it youself and noone can penetration test it. But Apple's OSs are as close as you can get.

       so I'm talking irl to someone.. ikr
      </p>
      <p>
       and I'm talking about making an outline/ catalogue of
       <em>
        concept bands
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       and the next time i go to FB, my timeline is flooded with sponsored links for
       <em>
        concept bands
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       another time, irl my so says we need laundry soap, and the next youtube video that i load has an coupon for the brand of laundry soap we use
      </p>
      <p>
       another time I'm talking irl about the JB Hunt trucking company, and how the founder was just a trucker who had the brilliant idea of hauling freight both ways, instead of returning home with an empty trailer.
      </p>
      <p>
       within 24 hours, JB Hunt is following me on twitter. not a follow-back, i had never followed them or tweet about them
      </p>
      <p>
       another time, there is the noise of cigarette lighter in the background, and twitter helpfully suggests that i follow Zippo lighters.
      </p>
      <p>
       we need to create some sort of background noise generator that just spouts off random words and noises. probably wouldn't take long for them to find a work-around

       Everyone looks at me like I'm literally crazy when I tell them I don't have a mobile/cell. "But what happens if you need to make a call in an emergency?" they ask. Well, I've never needed to but if I did...everyone else has a mobile phone, so I'd just ask if I could use theirs. And if I can casually drop in words like "bomb", "gun" and "ISIS" into the following phone conversation, so much the better ;)

       ugh same here. My SO's father got him the Google Home for Christmas. I didn't want it in our house, but there it is, listening. And you can't turn it off, you can just "mute" it. So I unplug it unless we need it for something, like we wanna put on music

       no, you can't turn it off. I wanted to return it to Best Buy, but SO felt very guilty about it because his father was really excited about the gift and wanted him to have it. He's very into the IoT and "techy" gifts like that and SO didn't want to make it awkward if Dad came over and saw it not in use.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know, it's a ridiculous story and we're putting SO's relationship with Dad over our security. I wish it wasn't like this. I think we're going to be seeing a lot more twisting of social expectations and issues of guilt and shame around not using certain technologies in the next decade. I've seen people get upset and feel personally offended when a loved one doesn't carry a cell phone, saying things like "how can I know you're okay?"

       Yikes that's a good point. I never thought about that. I understand where your SO is coming from though. I've had family members say those kinds of things to me. I've actually used the cell phone line on my own mother. Wow, you've given me a lot to think about.

       Yeah, I've been "cautious" and asked a lot of questions for years now. Honestly though it's better than ever. I'm going back to school to finish a degree and in my network diagnostics class we had a rousing debate about how the government is spying through all of our devices. A man actually randomly brought up Seth Rich and said he was murdered, which shocked me about to death. I think society is beginning to be a lot more "woke" than people realize.

       Can't say if they're listening devices for any specific reason, however, I don't believe they only record things when you speak to them. 
I have a friend who said they have Alexa (not sure which specific device) and she and her brother were in a room in their home talking, Alexa being in a completely different room. Supposedly, her brother was saying he had suicidal thoughts, and Alexa decided to speak up and say, "Don't do that! Here's a suicide hotline number and website for you." Neither of them adressed Alexa or were even in the same room speaking near her.
      </p>
      <p>
       While suggesting suicide hotlines can be helpful, there has to be a reason why she is listening at all times, and I don't know how good those intentions are.

       Well it has to be listening all the time right? Otherwise it wouldn't be able to hear when you wake it up. I think it's kind of neat that it tries to make you not kill yourself, but I still see no point in owning one.

       Yes and no. It has to be listening all the time to here it's startup cue i.e "Hey Alexa!", but I don't thinking it should be recordings your conversations and responding to you at any given time especially when you're in a different room. I've never really wanted to own one, I wouldn't use it. Just seems a bit invasive to me. 
I agree that it was kind (?) of Alexa to try and prevent an attempted suicide. Still invasive though.

      <p>
       To add to this a little bit, the reason for this is that the onboard processor can handle the limited signal processing to recognize the startup cue, as it's not a very computationally complex problem, but it couldn't possibly run the content-aware processing needed to figure out what you're asking. So, at least how these devices are promoted, they only listen locally for the cue, and once the cue is given, send the following audio over the network to be processed by Amazon's server.
      </p>

       Yes, exactly! Not that I would ever want one, but knowing that they listen and record more than advertised, I'm not sure I would buy one. Would also have an irrational fear that I would be asleep in the middle of the night and it would start talking to something/someone lol.

       You're probably not the only concerned one. Are you concerned enough about government spying to :- A) Not own any of those devices or any other 'smart' device capable of recording you. B) Not own a smartphone, C) not have a facebook or other social media account containing any personal information/pictures/videos of yourself, D) not ever use your real name except in business transactions online and E) Never browse without a VPN+Noscript except when it's absolutely necessary.  I do all of those things, but if the NSA really wanted to listen to every word I ever said or wrote, I have no doubt they probably could. Privacy is dead now, just be careful what you say and who you say it to.

       So, I'm standing there chopping veg for dinner, and the Echo turns itself on and starts playing music. Like Marvin Gaye or something - sexytime-mood music. Startled the living shit out of me. Annoyed, I say "Echo, stop." Back to chopping veg...
      </p>
      <p>
       A couple of minutes later, same thing, only louder... This time Rihanna's got Love on the Brain, loudly and unexpectedly. I'm startled again, but I ship Ri, so I'm not turning it off. Let it play, sing along, ok it's over, "Echo, stop."
      </p>
      <p>
       I gotta get dinner made. Focus. So this goes on for about 15 minutes until I unplug the fucking thing. Why is my Echo trying to put me in the mood while I'm chopping broccoli? Is someone at the CIA bored and fucking with a housewife? I wonder as I finish up dinner...
      </p>
      <p>
       Turns out the Echo has an app that you can download to control the device remotely (you know,
       <em>
        of course
       </em>
       it does). Husband found said app and thought he'd commence wooing during his commute by jump-scaring me with Barry White. "Hey, Baby!"

       I remember actually reading an xbox live update "agreement" back in 2011 and it stating the kinect can be on without the xbox actually being on and they can share whatever they want with law enforcement essentially.

       Needless to say, I contemplated this for 2 whole hours before consenting and getting back to Halo Reach.

       I use a smartphone. They way I hold it in my hand places my pinky right over the speaker. I feel vibrations in my pinky all the time. I'm usually just reading on my phone and not really talking but my children play and make noise. I feel like the vibrations I feel are the speaker turning on. Could that be? Is there a way to stop this? I guess it could really be anything but it's coming directly from the speaker. I thought it was just my silly conspiracy mind at first.  On another note, once I found my kids yelling at the Kinect to " stop listening" I immediately unplugged it. My SO will let the kids still play occasionally on the Kinect. But I am against it fully and just want that thing in the garbage.

       You are not the only one who
       <em>
        won't
       </em>
       buy into this shit tech. It used to be that the NSA could go "open switchook" on a land line phone, basically listen undetected to anyone with a phone and extensions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Eventually, as cell phones became prevalent, people started dropping their land lines. As long as they can listen on that cell, they don't need  the landline because people are stupid enough to carry it everywhere. However, now there are "holes" in the system, TV's and other devices have been remotely activated, even reading vibrations off of glass, but alas, still "holes" in a seamless surveillance grid.
      </p>
      <p>
       These handy microphones address that. Internet Protocol "IP" has been a godsend to spies and nosey functionaries and cops with low arrest numbers, or gung ho assholes looking for recognition and advancement, if only to be better at smashing your face with a size 12 Vibram sole.

       So when you cut the jack off headphones and put it in your laptop to keep the mic muted, would it work the same to do this with your cell phone? Of course if it does you would just have a cut mic jack sticking out of your phone all the time

       I also like the fact that most all cell phones no longer have a removable battery. I don't remember if iPhone's ever did but I know for sure Samsung phones did. What could be the purpose of this other than the fact that they don't want it to be easy for you to remove the battery. Because who knows if the device ever truly powers off when you turn it off.

       Heck, wireless routers or access points are being used to monitor breathing for patients in hospitals, it's more accurate than the old monitors.  They sell baby monitors that use it to monitor baby's breathing.  So it's not just stuff listening, they can image the inside of your home if you have the right device or router firmware.  A lot of people say they don't care.  Coupled with the fact that the average American commits like three felonies a day due to our bloated legal system, imagine the possibilities.  Anger the wrong person and those accidental felonies get noticed.  Later your neighbors will tell the news reporters that they are shocked because you always seemed so nice.  ;)
