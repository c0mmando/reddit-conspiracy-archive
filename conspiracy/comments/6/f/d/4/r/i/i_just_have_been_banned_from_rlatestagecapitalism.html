       Yea it's actually against the site wide rules of reddit to ban you in one subreddit for posts made in others. You are entitled to a germane appeal of your ban by messaging their mods politely.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's the rule that bans their use of automod in the way they are currently using it (to ban for any posts/comments in certain subs);
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        We know management of multiple communities can be difficult, but we expect you to manage communities as isolated communities and not use a breach of one set of community rules to ban a user from another community. In addition, camping or sitting on communities for long periods of time for the sake of holding onto them is prohibited.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Here's your right to appeal;
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Healthy communities allow for appropriate discussion (and appeal) of moderator actions. Appeals to your actions should be taken seriously. Moderator responses to appeals by their users should be consistent, germane to the issue raised and work through education, not punishment.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Admins do enforce these guidelines (and have already said as much publicly); so make sure to send a
       <a href="/r/reddit.com">
        /r/reddit.com
       </a>
       modmail if you don't get a germane appeal reply. Cheers.

       Yes I'm saying it is against the rules of reddit for the mods of
       <a href="/r/latestagecapitalism">
        /r/latestagecapitalism
       </a>
       to ban you for posts you made in other subreddits.
      </p>
      <p>
       The above guidelines are from the reddit admins, who mandate that all subreddit moderators follow their promulgated orders.

       Yes, your ban message says you were banned not for the article you posted but instead because of your prior history in
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       and another subreddit.
      </p>
      <p>
       That ban is a violation of the reddit moderator TOS, and if they don't overturn it you'll be able to lodge an appeal with the admins via the
       <a href="/r/reddit.com">
        /r/reddit.com
       </a>
       modmail.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sorry things are so confusing regarding this topic; the admins haven't been doing the best job of explaining to users how the new guidelines help to protect them from moderator abuse.

       Don't let the ban get you down too much; the sub you were banned from was taken over about 2 months ago by hyper PC-bros (I guess they're trying to crush puss or something) and has gone down hill considerably.

       Seems to me you were appealing the warning based on a defense of your actions, so any further discussion will have to take place in modmail. Cheers.

       They didn't ban you for your post.
      </p>
      <p>
       What happened is, they check based off who posts (so rather than send random users with no interest in the sub bans, it only checks to see if posters have used the subreddits they stated are 'reactionary'.  So when you made the post, it checked you out, saw you have posted here or t_d, and banned you for it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I wouldn't take it personally if I were you.   It's complete horse shit that they did that, but I mean, at this point in history that's what it has come down to and there is nothing we can do to stop these toddlers from behaving like toddlers.   The other user suggested reporting to admins, and I think you should too, but don't expect much.
      </p>
      <p>
       Left is so rage inducing, they are actively trying to censor in any way they can.  It would be funny if it wasn't so absurd, and effective.   This site is fucking cancer dude, seriously, cancer.   Since last year, just cancer.  I'm becoming a bit extremist - I'm not moving any more to the right (and there is plenty to move that way -  I usually lean left), but I am becoming extremist against those who actively seek to detail what others can and can't say (libtards).  Those people, as far as I'm concerned, need to be met with more than words, because they do not allow words to be spoken.  I predict it's going to get a whole lot worse before it gets better.

       The mods of that sub prefer to make it a 'safe space' where anyone vaguely associated with scary ideas like free speech or anything remotely contrary to their narrative is banned on sight. I shit you not.

      <p>
       And I'm pretty damn liberal admittedly, left-leaning, a democratic socialist economically, though a civil libertarian when it comes to issues of individual civil rights and the Constitution, hence why I don't bother going there. It's a circle-jerk for not just socialists, which I could tolerate unto itself, but authoritarians who are unable to tolerate dissent or opposing viewpoints, even hypothetically by merely being associated with or having posted in a sub they personally disagree with in a general sense.

       We don't ban for posting on other subreddits at the moment; however we do certainly ban if someone from another subreddit comes into conspiracy to comment in a maliciously subversive manner (as that would then be a violation of this communities guidelines).

       That's not what that rule says. It says you can't ban someone on Sub A for a rule that's on Sub B.
      </p>
      <p>
       In this case Sub A has a rule that says "no one who posts on Sub B is allowed here". There is no sitewide rule against rules like that.
