    <div class="md"><p>Reposting this to OP directly since the thread has been removed:</p>

<p>I&#39;ve debated addressing this, but I will because the mods have and I value transparency just as much as anyone here.</p>

<p>We have nothing to do with the mods and yes we&#39;re a new site. I have only submitted content here that I think is relevant to the community&#39;s interest and I have been lurking here on and off for years. </p>

<p>I also have never had any contact with the mods nor did I ask for my post to be stickied, another user may have or the mods may just have done it without being asked.</p>

<p>Yes, we recently placed one ad at the very bottom of the articles, which is far fewer, less intrusive, and less profitable than almost all news sites and other sites that are linked here.</p>

<p>You are all absolutely more than welcome to use an AdBlocker or use archive links to our site, we care more about the content than we do the revenue.</p>

<p>Speaking of revenue, I&#39;d like to give a little specific insight into that in the hopes that others don&#39;t get accused of exploiting the community. Internet ads are far less profitable for small publishers than you&#39;d think. That ad made a grand total of 17 cents yesterday, and it took me 10 hours to research, write, and get live. We also have hosting and domain costs that are far, far higher than that.</p>

<p>We will always only submit meticulously researched articles to this sub and value your feedback. Once again, you&#39;re always absolutely welcome to use an AdBlocker, use archive.is, or just downvote rightwavemedia.com links if you just don&#39;t like us and don&#39;t believe me.</p>

<p>But I promise you that we submitted that article for general interest and are very glad that some people appreciated it, and I&#39;m sorry if you didn&#39;t.</p>

<p>Edit: To be clear, 17 cents across the entire site, not just that article.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Honestly, I felt the same when that &#39;Everythings A Rich Mans Trick&#39; creator got a stickied AMA.  With a big notice that he was fundraising for a follow up doc.  </p>

<p>Just seemed to show preferential treatment.  I had no problem with the AMA being a sticky but the money-seeking aspect made it look like advertising tbh.   </p>

<p>Remember Ed Butowsky? The guy who was paying Rod Wheeler, the Seth Rich private investigator? Well it seems to me there are elements of republican influence that have a web of websites they use to push these stories which all end up being attacks on Democrats, usually the Clinton&#39;s. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wait, are you accusing Linda Ives?  Because that&#39;s a whole different allegation and not the point of this thread.  </p>

<p>Bizarre that you&#39;d make underhanded suggestions about a woman searching for justice for her murdered son.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not accusing her, she wants answers which I accept is fair. </p>

<p>However I find it hard to believe this woman, of her own volition, did an AMA on 4chan and also that she filed a new lawsuit regarding the 30 year old case in August 2016, in the midst of the election, without external influence. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve debated addressing this, but I will because the mods have and I value transparency just as much as anyone here.</p>

<p>We have nothing to do with the mods and yes we&#39;re a new site. I have only submitted content here that I think is relevant to the community&#39;s interest and I have been lurking here on and off for years. I also have never had any contact with the mods nor did I ask for my post to be stickied, another user may have or the mods may just have done it without being asked.</p>

<p>Yes, we recently placed one ad at the very bottom of the articles, which is far fewer, less intrusive, and less profitable than almost all news sites and other sites that are linked here. </p>

<p>You are all absolutely more than welcome to use an AdBlocker or use archive links to our site, we care more about the content than we do the revenue. </p>

<p>Speaking of revenue, I&#39;d like to give a little specific insight into that in the hopes that others don&#39;t get accused of exploiting the community. That ad made a grand total of 17 cents yesterday, and it took me 10 hours to research, write, and get live. We also have hosting and domain costs that are far, far higher than that.</p>

<p>We will always only submit meticulously researched articles to this sub and value your feedback. Once again, you&#39;re always absolutely welcome to use an AdBlocker, use archive.is, or just downvote rightwavemedia.com links if you just don&#39;t like us and don&#39;t believe me. </p>

<p>But I promise you that we submitted that article for general interest and are very glad that some people appreciated it, and I&#39;m sorry if you didn&#39;t. </p>
