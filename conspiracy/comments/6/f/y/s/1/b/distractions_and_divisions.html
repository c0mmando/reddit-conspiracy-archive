        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Hello fellow conspiracy theorists!</p>

<p>Tonight I&#39;d like to talk a little about distraction and division within our community.</p>

<p>As frequent visitors of this sub will note, we are constantly inundated with stories involving members of both the Democratic and Republican parties (U.S.), all races, and of course a plethora of conspiracy theories. The first two topics are the primary focus of this post, as they most easily lend themselves to manipulation at the cost of our independence. </p>

<p>Both the Republican and Democrat parties are engaged in nefarious practices ranging from voter fraud to underaged sex parties. Trump may currently control the White House, but keep in mind that the D-R split has been fairly equal over the past century.  You may hate Trump, but don&#39;t let that motto &quot;an enemy of my enemy is a friend of mine&quot; creep too close. <strong>Both</strong> parties are sick and corrupt piles of human waste. <strong>Neither</strong> party should be supported by true conspiracy theorists, as we know the 2 party system is an inherent method of control by TPTB. </p>

<p><strong>Race</strong></p>

<p>Black Lives Matter. Or do all lives matter?</p>

<p>We currently find ourselves at a crossroads. African Americans want us to recognize the oppression they&#39;ve suffered during and since slavery was legal, as do various other races who have come to America seeking prosperity, only to find they&#39;re second class citizens (until a politician needs their votes). Do black lives matter? Of course! What about white lives? Yes, them too. Latino? Yes, them as well. All lives matter!</p>

<p>My belief is that these societal constructs are being used to divide us further and further, until we as a society share only the laws we obey. If we team up with those who share a very similar trait, sure we might be powerful. We might even be able to choose our politicians and laws with ease. But will we be powerful in a real sense? No. As long as we&#39;re divided we will fall, we will succumb to the might that is TPTB. But if we rise above the chaos, above the superficial, we can do truly tremendous things.</p>

<p>So what holds us back from greatness? Ourselves. TPTB may hold sway over the ordinary, the superficial, but it is our duty as &quot;awake&quot; individuals to ensure the truth of reality spreads until, finally, we can take back this planet and restore her and us to our loving roots. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t expect this to gain much traction since I&#39;m posting this at  non-peak time, but I feel this had to be said. Enough distractions and divisions. If we ever want to end the corruption, we must stand strong, and together. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re fishing for a proper response, so I&#39;ll give it to you. People respond more positively to people who share similar beliefs/traits as themselves. You might think this is all your (&quot;their&quot;) doing but there is something more sinister at play here. Archons, demons, etc., are constantly producing intrusive thoughts and actions that cause you to sink to their level. Just because you think of murdering your dog doesn&#39;t mean you&#39;re a horrible person. We all have similar thoughts, for similar reasons. We must learn to dissociate ourselves from such vile ideas, and instead focus on the betterment of humanity.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah I completely get where you&#39;re coming from but at this moment in time, do you think we could successfully manage such communities in an effective manner? As of now I believe our societal constructs are so overwhelming that it will take at least 1-2 further generations to get to this point, given we are able to dispatch TPTB within a decade or so. The vast majority of people will need some serious de-conditioning to accept such a system, and I don&#39;t see my elders voluntarily subjecting themselves to a more tribal type of community. By that point in time we&#39;ll probably have rediscovered more of our innate ESP powers and will no longer need to confine ourselves by space but rather by time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think this is a good post. </p>

<p>With honesty, I believe the Black Lives Matter movement had a strong core at its inception. Police brutality against minorities, and blacks in particular, is a real issue that can be verified with statistics and data found from studies. Unfortunately, as it began to grow across the country, the meaning of the entire movement was completely taken out context as anyone could adopt the name. It&#39;s the latter that creates a further divide.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Trump may currently control the White House</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Republicans control the House, Senate, White House, and just successfully stole control of the Supreme Court which had previously handed the White House to GWB. That puts Republicans in power, and makes them the Establishment. In fact, Republicans have been the party of big business <em>consistently</em> since before Abraham Lincoln. No exceptions.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>keep in mind that the D-R split has been fairly equal over the past century</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A century is a long time. In fact, of the past 23 years, Republicans have controlled Congress for 19 of them.</p>

<p>Republicans have controlled the Supreme Court for 47 years straight (including during the <em>Roe v. Wade</em> decision.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>motto &quot;an enemy of my enemy is a friend of mine&quot; creep too close</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Tell the Republicans, as they seem to have warmed up nicely to the party that was responsible for the NEW PEARL HARBOR, and all because Donald Trump claims to be an outsider -- a claim which has been proven false.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Both parties are sick and corrupt piles of human waste. Neither party should be supported by true conspiracy theorists</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Very true, but it wasn&#39;t that long ago that Hillary Clinton, who wasn&#39;t in power had to be defeated by anyone <em>no matter what</em>. It is time now to recognize that Donald Trump deserves the same treatment. Fair is fair.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Black Lives Matter. Or do all lives matter?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If &quot;all lives matter&quot; is a way to defeat claims by activists who literally want to stop police state killing, then any good conspiracy investigator would have to choose black lives matter. It&#39;s a no-brainer.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Of course! What about white lives? Yes, them too. Latino? Yes, them as well. All lives matter!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If black lives matter gains police state reform, it applies to all lives.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No dispute on your first point.</p>

<p>Nor on your second. </p>

<p>When was Donald Trump proven an &quot;insider&quot;? He certainly hired a lot of scumbags for his cabinet but prior to his election he was considered an outsider since he&#39;s not a career politicians like many he was up against. </p>

<p>You&#39;re right, fair is fair, and Donald Trump needs to be thoroughly investigated for any wrongdoings. Let&#39;s not let politics dictate what we focus on entirely though.</p>

<p>I dispute your claim that taking the side of BLM is a &quot;no-brainer&quot;. There are clear hints that the entire movement has been co-opted by special interests, making it almost irrelevant. </p>

<p>If the BLM movement gains further traction and catalyzes police reform, then all the more to them! However, by singling out one race we drastically reduce our potential of creating massive, race-exclusive reforms. </p>

<p>When was Donald Trump proven an &quot;insider&quot;?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>TV gave him unprecedented amounts of positive coverage.</p>

<p>Republicans diluted the competition and allowed him to be the stand out candidate -- making his nomination inevitable from the beginning.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a really long list. </p>

<p>Stock market burst with excitement when he &quot;won.&quot;</p>

<p>He wound up throwing out all of his promises except the establishment Koch brothers agenda.</p>

<p>etc. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>He&#39;s an insider in the sense that he&#39;s a very wealthy and powerful individual, rather than being a career politician (who are bought and sold like candy). I personally was hoping he&#39;d win the election (though I voted Green), since he was up against the (imo) warmonger HRC. Most news outlets berated him constantly for his poor grammar/vocabulary, but overall they helped his campaign by giving him any coverage <em>at all</em>. They all focused on him nearly 24/7 and they expect him to lose? You&#39;d think they&#39;d have learned that exposure=popularity, but you never know. I&#39;m not quite on the side that Trump was the &quot;chosen one&quot; but I can certainly believe he has personal debts that he incompetently showcased in his cabinet hirings. He&#39;s a scumbag, but perhaps he&#39;s the scumbag we need right now. Don&#39;t take that as approval for his nefarious acts, but rather as a warning of what we could be experiencing right now. </p>

<p>The &quot;career politician&quot; notion is one of the main talking points of Republicans. You literally bought into pure Republican propaganda. Long story short: If we keep voting elected officials out (or impose term limits), only the corporate lobbyists will be veterans in DC.  That gives them more power.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Vladimir Putin himself said at one point before the election that HRC&#39;s rhetoric was over the top and even he didn&#39;t believe it -- it was just election talk.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Baby teasing is something that works better to confuse issues and support Republicans as history shows. The end-justifies-the-means Republican mentality makes them immune to being affected by this. </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s the first trick in the book -- tell them they don&#39;t want it and they will rush to support it.</p>

<p>You&#39;re onto something big here ...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>but you never know.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Damn. Blew it. You think that suddenly in 2016 MSM FORGOT? </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>This view should have ended after GWB stole the election and people thought it would lead to change. It led to change all right -- GWB did horrible damage. Then, hope and change man came in and left most of it about the same. </p>

<p>Every time people believe that putting in &quot;scumbag&quot; in is going to lead to some kind of awakening, it fails. </p>
