       I see this perspective on here sometimes but lately it always seems to be dismissed in favor of bickering over the competing narratives. I wish there was more acknowledgement that we seem to be living in a constructed reality, some way to have a discussion about it that doesn't veer off into insanity. It's a really strange thing and very difficult to come to terms with. It's hard to wrap your head around it and develop a likely picture in your mind of what's actually happening behind the scenes.

       That's why I've taken to not trying to wrap my head around it.  In my day to day life I try to be a good person the best I can.  The majority of the people in the world don't want the status quo to change.  They might not say it, but even people living in the worst conditions don't want change.  It's a strange phenomenon.

       The deep state is clearly trying to take down trump with the Russia stuff. It's so obvious. The people who say "trump is working with the deep state" I wonder what you guys will say when trump is actually impeached over the phony Russia stuff. Will you then admit that the deep state was against trump? Or will you continue saying that this was all a show?

       I would think Trump was meant to be impeached, especially if he faces no tangible consequences except losing the office. So many things him and his team have said and done have nothing but played into the idea he's working with Russia, and the bizarre compliments he gave Putin during the election make me thing the whole thing has been planned for a while. He doesn't act innocent but at the same time the Russia narrative seems unlikely and absurd, almost as though the whole series of events have been designed so two opposite narratives could be imposed upon them. Why this is all being done I have no good idea, but taking it at face value it just doesn't add up to me.

       What even is the deep state in your view? Because I'm pretty sure the deep state, which most people agree to mean entrenched and un-elected security, intel, banking, and corporate interests (many of which are interwoven), has more objectives than "keep Trump out"

       The intelligence agencies are the deep state, and it's the intelligence agencies that the media cites when they push the fake Russian hacking narrative. Not everyone in these agencies is against trump, but overall they are definitely against trump. If they were against trump, then this Russian hacking narrative would not exist.

       You need to break the confines of the box you're stuck in. Things are NEVER as they appear. It may appear to you that the deep state is against Trump, but they are always one step ahead in the game. This is all being orchestrated. Trump
       <em>
        might
       </em>
       have been an unexpected roll of the die, or perhaps he was the plan all along,  but either way, the game is still completely and utterly rigged.
      </p>
      <p>
       I honestly couldn't tell you what the plan with Trump is. HE may very well be impeached, but if he is, its all just a part of the show.  Trump is part of the big club, which means he doesn't care about us. How do I know? Because you and I most certainly are not.

       It's definitely how lawyers generally work.  They fight vigorously in court pretending they care about the clients and then go grab a pint or two laughing about their gullible idiot clients paying them thousands of dollars to "care".

       I've read part of a book
       <em>
        CIA AS ORGANIZED CRIME
       </em>
       by Douglas Valentin which indicates the CIA has a history of infiltrating organizations--whether it be the Office of Naval Intelligence, the DEA or the FBI.  Certainly, the CIA infiltrating the DNC or the RNC isn't too big of a stretch from there...
      </p>
      <p>
       Now consider the late stages of Empire which the USA is currently in--the CIA &amp; Deep State forces are desperate, both to keep the gravy train going and to not get exposed.  If the general public figures things out there would eventually be some type of reaction to the mass corruption.
      </p>
      <p>
       CIA/Deep State need to keep the public focused on the political circus, which also helps feed the corporate media conglomerates.  The money and power which our nation now needs to feed WAR, INC. USA needs a continuous side show to hide the extreme amount of chaos and destruction in Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria, Yemen, Somalia (etc.) which the USA is actively participating and leading.

       I think the "Russia connection will take down Trump, is theater," to lull people into thinking something will be done about the most currupt election (it was a coup) and administration.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump is either an unwitting captive or a better actor than Reagan.
      </p>
      <p>
       His appointees are all part of the Tea Party network whose major funders have been at war against this democratic republic for decades.  They hate the very idea of a "government by the people,)  they hate individual rights for common people, they hate labor protections and minimum wages they want unions outlawed and they want voting if allowed to be severely limited.
      </p>
      <p>
       They have been pushing for a re-write of the U.S. Constitution for these reasons.  They expect to achieve that goal before the 2018 midterms and have a good chance of doing so.
      </p>
      <p>
       Elections with widespread voter enfranchisement (to us peons)  are their enemy.

       Yes, absolutely.  They know people's lives are getting shittier and shittier.  They know they can't or don't want to fix that.  They know people will get angry at the system if they don't get distracted.  Modern politics is nothing but a distraction for kleptocracy.

       This thought has definitely occurred to me. However, I keep going back to the (absurd) level of coordinated attacks that the entire MSM and all other political actors have leveled against Trump starting from when he first gained traction, and then increasing by orders of magnitude the day after he was elected. The telling point for me was the almost deafening silence from the MSM (and shills/bots online) the moment during election night when they realized Trump was
       <em>
        actually
       </em>
       going to be elected. They appeared to be stunned and needed some time to regroup. The faces of the talking heads at that moment was priceless. And there were comments all over (
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics
       </a>
       for example) about how eerily "normal" the discussions seemed for a short time.
