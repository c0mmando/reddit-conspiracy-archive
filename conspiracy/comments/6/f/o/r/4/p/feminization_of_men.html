<p>I believe they are trying to weaken Men by having us dress up in this kinda shit. I mean Dave Chappelle quit his show because he didn&#39;t want to wear a dress...</p>

<p>Is there a deeper agenda for all these new &quot;men&#39;s&quot; clothing lines?</p>

<p>Edit: Top Comment and exactly what I was trying to convey...</p>

<p>&quot;Make men more womanly, and you have a weaker population that&#39;s more easily manipulated. I got down voted hard last time I said this. But I don&#39;t care. All the 50 million new genders? Pushing people to reject masculine traits? I&#39;m a chick, and I can see how this is making a generation of girly men that are easily led around.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To me this has nothing to do with straight or gay. It has everything to do with stripping men of their masculinity. Drag culture is one thing, where men mocked society, and this was a good thing. But there seems to be a massive campaign to feminize all men, and demonize those who don&#39;t go along with it. This weakens our society. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>lol, yeah except for the controlled environment, as they noted in the video. But yeah, if you watched the one I posted, Camille Paglia talks about how early Greek art showed robust manly men, and the art before they collapsed depicted much more effeminate men. She talks about false sense of sophistication in these types of people and how this breeds a desire for heroic masculinity. Heroic masculinity seen in today&#39;s case in the evil that is ISIS. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, because you&#39;re misrepresenting my argument. Just because I assert that someone looks good wearing something ( or in this case the real assertion was that our ideas for what is masculine/feminine change all the time) does not mean that I have given a pass to all other actions they might engage in. The discussion was about his clothing choice, not anything else, because the rest is irrelevant. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No it is not irrelevant... Because being masculine is a general trait... a combination of a personality and action... Being masculine means doing the right thing regardless og consequence. It means having a strong belife in core values. Men do not have that, they know what they are &quot;allowed&quot; and &quot;not allowed&quot; to do. Right and wrong does not come in the mix. </p>

<p>It is very cute when people mention the idea about  masculine/feminine and change all the time... Weeeeelll not really. Hot and beautifull is always hot and beautiful. Fat and ugly is fat ugly and worthless ... Sure it is unfair.. but ... </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No masculine is not a general trait. Masculine is an adjective that can be assigned to different objects. A razor can be masculine. A ball can be masculine. A word can be masculine. Obviously these things don&#39;t have &quot;actions&quot;.</p>

<p>Masculine is a vague concept that we can assign to different things or people. However it is not a clearly defined concept. You obviously have an opinion about what that idea entails, but it&#39;s not an objective truth because that idea is different for everyone.</p>

<p>And your entire second paragraph is ridiculous. It&#39;s well documented that theses concept change. Pink used to be an exclusively male color. High heels used to be very fashionable for men. Colorful and flamboyant attire was all the rage in the renaissance for the high society male. This doesn&#39;t even address the act that the concept of masculine and feminine are drastically different around the world.</p>

<p>As far as your &quot;fat and ugly&quot; comment it&#39;s just factually incorrect. What we considered beautiful has drastically changed depending on where and when you lived. For much of western society&#39;s history being fat and bald was considered attractive. </p>

<p>But, pink, blue, red, heels, etc . etc. Does not make women horny, scared, moralized, subservient. </p>

<p>We are talking about two different things. </p>

<p>Let us examine history: </p>

<p>Cleopatra... Not fat and ugly. 
Drawings on the pyramids.... Tall and fit... 
Vitruvian Man ... Tall and fit.. 
Ancient drawings from the Olympics and Greece.. Yehh no fat and ugly... 
David&#39;s Michelangelo ...  TALL AND FIT !!! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not the confused one here.</p>

<p>European Renaissance - woman wanted recessing hairlines and would pluck or shave their hair to achieve this look. They would also often completely remove their eyebrows.</p>

<p>Ancient China - feet were literally deformed to be considered beautiful with the use of foot binding.</p>

<p>Mayans - would purposefully deform the skulls of children to make them elongated.</p>

<p>Japan - black teeth were considered the standard in married women through the 19th century.</p>

<p>17th Century England - veiny cleavage was very attractive. Because having pale skin was considered a sign of wealth and status women would actually draw on blue veins to make their breasts look paler.</p>

<p>Greeks - considered unibrows to be very attractive and women would often draw them on.</p>

<p>These are just a few examples of how beauty standards can change dramatically. </p>

<p>I would never wear such a thing but I couldn&#39;t care less if someone else did, has zero to do with me. What someone chooses to drape over their body is their business. Are you feeling like someone would force you to wear an item of clothing that is historically feminine? Or would you feel threatened as a man if men around you started wearing clothing that was traditionally worn by women?  Would you have any feelings about women wearing more masculine clothing, men&#39;s haircuts, and appearing androgynous in public? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Is my post not an original thought? Seeing ads for all these new clothing lines drew me to the research of the topic. There&#39;s a lot of people who are agreeing with my logic. </p>

<p>We gone over the part where it creates a weaker society of men, not being manly makes men easier to control. You won&#39;t stand to fight when the fighting comes. Let me grab my romper for battle! </p>

<p>Some have mentioned estrogen in plastics as one way to help this happen faster. Having men wear what is considered girly clothing. Other men subliminally see this as normal, the ones easy to manipulate.</p>

<p>There&#39;s another level hidden within Hollywood, perpetuating men in women&#39;s clothing. It&#39;s a ritual of sorts. They love dressing up men in women&#39;s clothing to show men as women. Bring them down. Repetition is how they can make things sink in. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My feelings are likely not accurate? Wow! So you being a women means you know nothing of how a man feels, and the lack of masculinity that one might feel. </p>

<p>Like I said you&#39;re right my theory isn&#39;t full, but I have a feeling there&#39;s something deeper to it all. There are tons of theorists out there that say &quot;I feel like something big is going to happen&quot;, and you come saying you&#39;re feelings don&#39;t mean shit? Well you&#39;re feelings on this subject don&#39;t mean shit to me. How would you know anything of being a man and not feeling masculine? You can&#39;t.</p>

<p>&quot;Between 1999 and 2000, the U.S. Geological Survey sampled 139 surface waters throughout the U.S. They discovered that 80% of these waters contained endocrine disrupting chemicals (mostly estrogens).&quot; So if these chemicals are in the water, and making men feel feminine then are presented repeatedly with women&#39;s clothing for men, what do you think they will &quot;feel&quot;? It COULD have an effect on their though processes...Low T, and high estrogen can make a man feel muscle weakness or loss of muscle...thus making them feel weaker...</p>

<p>Marketing clothing that is very feminine and some ways made specifically for women. I can&#39;t imagine a man feeling masculine wearing these types of clothing. But a repetition of marketing in your face saying it&#39;s the new fad, and you should wear them can be subliminal. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Feelings are subjective, who knew!</p>

<p>You are conflating separate issues. Masculinity is a social construct, not a feeling. The way one feels about being masculine or not is a matter of how they perceive themselves to measure up to that construct. Those feelings do not actually reflect the state of masculinity itself. What we consider &quot;masculine&quot; is defined by society at large and can change drastically from one location or time period to another.</p>

<p>Additionally subliminal marketing has the goal of selling product, there is no evidence to suggest that there is an effort to make men weaker or more effeminate. There is also no evidence that wearing clothing that might be considered &quot;feminine&quot; does anything to either the mental or physical status of a man, assuming it&#39;s voluntary. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It can be a true statement, just not a literal one. The same way you can &quot;feel blue&quot; despite blue not being a feeling. Blue is a stand in for the feeling of sadness. &quot;Feeling masculine&quot; is a stand in for feeling all of the complex traits and meanings that go into that word.

    <div class="md"><p>I meant that the ridiculously dressed person would feel it stupid to call out someone who wore something differently ridiculous. Not that you were stupid for questioning it.</p>

<p>Maybe there really is an agenda to suppress masculine traits. Or maybe the agenda is to blur gender. So practically speaking develop a different concept of gender that transcends the customs and traditions we assign to them today (dresses for women, suits for men etc). Perhaps the intention is to weaken aggression as a masculine trait. </p>

<p>Is that so bad? Most of the world&#39;s problems are caused by angry dudes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nobody said it is bad...  </p>

<p>It is actually fucking magical. Since most men are manginas, women are DESPERATE... Like really desperate... So some gym time, some game and some good clothes... and you start fucking DESTROYING tinder.... And best of all is you don&#39;t even have to worry about any of them get pregnant. Since there is sooo many manginas, they take care of your children ! Fucking magic ! If they do a bad job you can even call the police and they will move your kid to another mangina. Also treating women like shit is comepletly acceptable. Equality and stuff.... </p>

<p>It is like this... Would killing 90 % of the earth population be bad ? Yess... but not for the 10%. Then it will be good... </p>

<p>So moral of the story is&gt; DO NOT BE A BITCH ! </p>

<p>&quot;Make men more womanly, and you have a weaker population that&#39;s more easily influenced.&quot;</p>

<p>Fashion is a result of social constructs; it&#39;s not hardwired into our DNA, and in my opinion, has no effect on how weak or easily manipulated people are. Using this logic, you are suggesting that women are weak and easily manipulated in their &#39;feminine clothing&#39;, which is a problematic argument in itself. Would a woman who wears masculine clothing instantly become strong and difficult to manipulate?</p>

<p>I did read the comments, but unfortunately, I couldn&#39;t find any evidence of the agenda you theorised. You provided a link to a Google video search of &#39;feminization of men&#39; in a reply to one comment, which simply opened up a page of YouTube videos of that title, but nothing specific.</p>

<p>I&#39;m interested to know what other &#39;factors&#39; you&#39;re referring to, as the only factor mentioned in your post is about clothing; hence why my comment also only mentions clothing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Finland&#39;s not that bad though, we&#39;re much more manlier here, even our women (in comparison). So our women are hot yet a bit manly (in a sexy way meaning they&#39;ll drink beer and talk about cars, do weightlifting etc. just see the Hydraulic Press Channel -dudes wife for a great example of what our women are like), but our men are even manlier so it evens out. We don&#39;t just take the multiculturalism thing automatically either, we are very vocal about sensible immigration. Left leaning but not to the point of Sweden.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nobody said it is bad...  </p>

<p>It is actually fucking magical. Since most men are manginas, women are DESPERATE... Like really desperate... So some gym time, some game and some good clothes... and you start fucking DESTROYING tinder.... And best of all is you don&#39;t even have to worry about any of them get pregnant. Since there is sooo many manginas, they take care of your children ! Fucking magic ! If they do a bad job you can even call the police and they will move your kid to another mangina. Also treating women like shit is comepletly acceptable. Equality and stuff.... </p>

<p>It is like this... Would killing 90 % of the earth population be bad ? Yess... but not for the 10%. Then it will be good... </p>

<p>So moral of the story is&gt; DO NOT BE A BITCH ! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Feelings are subjective, who knew!</p>

<p>You are conflating separate issues. Masculinity is a social construct, not a feeling. The way one feels about being masculine or not is a matter of how they perceive themselves to measure up to that construct. Those feelings do not actually reflect the state of masculinity itself. What we consider &quot;masculine&quot; is defined by society at large and can change drastically from one location or time period to another.</p>

<p>Additionally subliminal marketing has the goal of selling product, there is no evidence to suggest that there is an effort to make men weaker or more effeminate. There is also no evidence that wearing clothing that might be considered &quot;feminine&quot; does anything to either the mental or physical status of a man, assuming it&#39;s voluntary. </p>
