        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I don&#39;t think Russia is responsible for the DNC leaks, but there&#39;s still a possibility that they are responsible for the Podesta emails so let&#39;s just consider both to be true for MSM purposes... </p>

<p>Should we really blame Russia for &#39;meddling&#39; and attempting to interfere with our election if what they exposed about our next potential president was true? Call me a Russian Agent if you must, but if they are guilty of hacking and leaking, I would like to personally thank them for doing so since they prevented us from electing one of the most dangerously corrupt politicians in all of recent history. Not saying Trump is a saint by any means since he continues to go against everything he campaigned on, but Hillary Clinton is without a doubt one of the most disgustingly corrupt politicians in Washington DC and if you don&#39;t see that by now, you&#39;re making a conscious choice to remain ignorant. Being anti-Hillary does not mean that I&#39;m pro-Trump so don&#39;t come at me with t_d bullshit in an attempt to dismiss what I&#39;m getting at here. </p>

<p>So who should really be held responsible for attempting to influence the election? American MSM..... that&#39;s who</p>

<p>News outlets pose themselves as being to be dedicated to exposing the truth and informing citizens on issues WITHOUT BIAS. This election proved once and for all that the MSM doesn&#39;t give a fuck about the truth, and that they will do everything to protect those they serve. They lied to the people and  refused to address the majority of the corruption that was found in the emails, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rRh5P19aehA">with CNN even going so far as telling viewers that only they were allowed to view the WikiLeaks emails</a>, as it would be illegal for the plebians to do so. They&#39;re still not even covering the DNC lawsuit, and if they have, it&#39;s been minimal coverage!!</p>

<p>And yet RT continues to prove itself as a more unbiased news outlet than any of the American media outlets, but nooo we shouldn&#39;t trust anything that comes from them because &quot;they&#39;re state-sponsored media&quot;!!!!!  If you still don&#39;t see that American media is &quot;state-sponsored&quot; after this election, you&#39;re a fool.  </p>

<p>With every day that they continue to push this bullshit Russia witch hunt in the media, I lose more and more faith in fair American reporting, not that I had much to begin with anyways. They will report extensively on info from &quot;anonymous sources&quot; and spin every story to favor their desired narrative, but still won&#39;t talk about the fact that the <a href="https://thefloridasqueeze.com/2017/05/01/dnc-lawsuit-youre-morons-to-believe-us-part-1-of-3/">DNC literally argued in court that they have no obligation to follow the wishes of their donors</a> and have every right to pick the candidate of their choice behind closed doors... They still don&#39;t understand that their biased, selective reporting is having the opposite desired effect and more people are starting to see the truth as a result. </p>

<p>And as far as Russia-Trump goes- while it may be illegal or unethical, I&#39;m sure that it&#39;s not uncommon for politicians or their advisors/aides to be in communication with foreign nations and if we had as many leaks from the Obama Admin regarding communications with Saudi Arabia, Israel, Qatar etc. I&#39;m sure he would have faced an investigation as well. What would have happened if everyone found out that <a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/8190">a banker from Citigroup emailed John Podesta</a> in October 2008 with their <a href="https://www.rt.com/usa/362836-emails-citigroup-obama-cabinet/">desired cabinet members for Obama</a>, most of whom were ultimately appointed once he was inaugurated? Don&#39;t you think there would have been some concern there seeing as how he was elected at a time when bankers had a lot at stake due to the recession? </p>

<p>I&#39;m not dismissing that the possibility of a potential Russia-Trump collusion or arguing that this possibility wouldn&#39;t be dangerous for Americans... My issue is with the coverage of this investigation, the bullshit coverage during the election, and with the American public continuing to buy the pile of shit they&#39;re being fed by MSM. </p>

<p>Fuck you CNN, FOX, ABC, MSNBC, CNBC, and whatever other anagram outlets I forgot. Fuck all of you for blaming Russia and Putin for something you yourselves are guilty of. </p>

<p>You see it all the time. (i.e. - I cheated on my spouse because YOU didn&#39;t make me happy. I am addicted to drugs because THEY sold them to me. I got in trouble at work because YOU ratted on me. Etc. etc.)</p>

<p>No one can take responsibility for anything.</p>

<p>The US government is no different. </p>

<p>They&#39;re only exposed as corrupt because THEY leaked the info.</p>

<p>Russian elite invested nearly $100 million in Trump buildings</p>

<p><a href="http://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-trump-property/">http://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-trump-property/</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>After his bankruptcies in the 1990s, Trump borrowed money from Russian financiers.[5][6] At a 2008 Manhattan real estate conference Donald Trump Jr. said one of Trump&#39;s main sources of income are Russian customers, noting &quot;Russians make up a pretty disproportionate cross-section of a lot of our assets… we see a lot of money pouring in from Russia.&quot;[3][2][7][8]</p>

<p>A 2008 home sale in Florida has received extensive scrutiny. Trump bought a 6.3-acre estate in 2005 for about $41 million, and sold it to Russian oligarch Dmitry Ruybolovlev in 2008 for $95 million, billed as the most expensive single-family home sale ever. Ruybolovlev eventually tore down the house and subdivided the property.[9]</p>

<p>Individual Russians have invested heavily in Trump buildings and other real estate. One report said that 63 different Russians have purchased $100 million worth of apartments in Trump-branded Florida properties. This is probably an undercount since many of the properties were purchased by limited liability companies. The report added that there is no suggestion of wrongdoing by Trump in these purchases, and that many Russians regard American real estate as a good, safe investment.[10]</p>

<p>So what that Russians have purchased real estate from Trump.  What does that have to do with the price of tea in China? The guy is in the business of property investment.  Are you saying because the dirty Russian bought property that he....wait I can&#39;t think of anything.   Oh neither can you.  </p>

<p>What other foreigners have purchased from Trump? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So why did the RNC back Trump if he was such a compromised candidate?</p>

<p>The entire Republican party is to blame for Trump getting in power, not Russia.</p>

<p>And anyone involved with the DNC that new about the collusion against Sanders and did nothing are guilty for Democratic corruption, not Russia.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think Russia is necessarily the &quot;good guy caught in the middle&quot; by a longshot, but &quot;the dog ate my homework&quot; is not acceptable from either side of the American political aisle.</p>
