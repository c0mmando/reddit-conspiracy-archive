        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>This is a deliberate attempt to import thousands of people that hate our guts and want us dead. To create a segregated society that are continuously at each others throats. Everyone too scared of each other to do anything about the militarisation of our countries, funding bonanza for our intelligence agencies and perpetual arms sales for wars all over the world.</p>

<p>Certain groups of people that are orchestrating this, are making trillions of dollars and all it&#39;ll cost in return is the destruction of western civilisation, a few thousand lives in the west, and countless more lives in the middle east.</p>

<p>The scariest part is, it is all unfolding in front of our very eyes, all in the open, our governments are not even bothering to hide it. As long as the BBC and CNN keep telling us we&#39;re the good guys, everyone plays along just as the shadow governments of all our countries want. And there&#39;s nothing we can do about it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is comical, but I find it compassionate. Sort of saying, &quot;Hey guys sorry our government fucked up your country, you can crash here if you want.&quot;</p>

<p>I view this the same way I view illegal immigrants from South America. We have been fucking their continent for hundreds of years, for money. We overthrow governments, install dictators, murder civilians, just do whatever we want. OF COURSE those same people will want to come here where it&#39;s relatively stable.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I say &quot;we&quot; too but I now try to say the &quot;US government&quot; instead. </p>

<p>We do need to be held responsible for our country&#39;s actions though so maybe we is more appropriate lol.</p>

<p>But at this point there is so many black operations going on that we simply can&#39;t stop it at all. Only thing stopping it could be an internal struggle for power within the government...this isn&#39;t 1776 and we are not fighting people with muskets.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know how to stop it either, I don&#39;t trust Trump and I don&#39;t trust the intelligence state. They both are evil.</p>

<p>Most people get their news from the TV, and those that don&#39;t use the internet which is just as suspectible to fake news. It&#39;s getting increasingly harder to determine the truth from all the shit that gets shoveled in our face.</p>

<p>And I absolutely have to use &quot;we&quot; when talking about the US government, because as a cititzen I am absolutely responsible for what my government does. I voted for some of the people in office. And so did my fellow citizens.</p>

<p>A quote I always come back to is Douglas Adams from The Hitchhiker&#39;s Guide</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Odd,&quot; said Arthur, &quot;I thought you said it was a democracy.&quot;
&quot;I did,&quot; said Ford. &quot;It is.&quot;
&quot;So,&quot; said Arthur, hoping he wasn&#39;t sounding ridiculously obtuse, &quot;why don&#39;t people get rid of the lizards?&quot;
&quot;It honestly doesn&#39;t occur to them,&quot; said Ford. &quot;They&#39;ve all got the vote, so they all pretty much assume that the government they&#39;ve voted in more or less approximates to the government they want.&quot;
&quot;You mean they actually vote for the lizards?&quot;
&quot;Oh yes,&quot; said Ford with a shrug, &quot;of course.&quot;
&quot;But,&quot; said Arthur, going for the big one again, &quot;why?&quot;
&quot;Because if they didn&#39;t vote for a lizard,&quot; said Ford, &quot;the wrong lizard might get in.</p>

<p>From this Pew Research article:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>About 3 million refugees have come into the country since 1980.</p></li>
<li><p>In fiscal 2016, the largest number of refugees came from Congo, 16,370. </p></li>
<li><p>Following Congo are Syria (12,587), Burma (aka Myanmar, with 12,347), Iraq (9,880) and Somalia (9,020). </p></li>
<li><p>The largest numbers of refugees have come from Burma (159,692) and Iraq (135,643) over the past decade.</p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>I have a different take on this. By importing refugees from the countries we are destroying, we&#39;re not trying to crash OUR system. It may cause some instability, but if you&#39;re playing the long game? Then no. The point is to cause a complete crash of THOSE countries. Total destruction.</p>

<p>We still are not in an all out war, we&#39;re have a proxy war with Syria, for example. Proxy war takes a long time. 2 ways to speed it up:</p>

<p>1- reduce their population through total warfare
2- reduce their population through assimilation.</p>

<p>In short, the WEst are The Borg.</p>
