<p>Again, he wasn&#39;t a democrat. Seems like he went out of his way in his career to not have a democrat label until he wanted to use their party in a presidential election. </p>

<p>Clinton won California and that sealed the deal. So if you want proof of vote rigging I&#39;d start there. Until then the DNC emails look like a bunch of strategy to ultimately put the interests of the party into the white house. Democrats are a still an American party trying to appeal to centrists or capitalists. Not just the young people who are being shafted by capitalism and student loans. The older people who are established in life don&#39;t need free education because so many others who have paid see it as unfair.</p>

<p>As much as I do not like the man the U.S President is and some of the issues he stands upon... I do not believe the election was stolen by anything other than the propaganda used on swing states to get the electoral college. Cambridge Analytica has access to people&#39;s data and a powerful social media weapon developed by some brit. So then you&#39;d need an army of propagandists to target people on social media or the outlets those people would be most likely to use. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wrong on several points.    The media covered the hell out of Trump or he would not have been the republican nominee.     Clinton was highly anticipated to win and her and the DNC had engaged in highly dubious behaviors.    </p>

<p>Trumps win was a surprise and there is no evidence that the Russians were involved in the wikileaks or Comey actions that might have ended up hurting Hillary.     Hillary and the Trump haters are sore losers.    Trump is indeed messed up but would you rather have Pence?    You are not being rational.    Hillary wanted to go to war with Russia during the election by confronting Russian jets in Syria.   Do you remember.   The deep state has wanted a new cold war for a long time.    And the deep state would rather have Pence than Trump,  that&#39;s obvious.   They would have rather had Hillary,  but they misjudged the election.    There were a lot of ordinary Americans who after 8 years of Obama had given up on the Wall Street Democrats.   It happened.   And Russia was not the deciding factor.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>One of the biggest problems here is that the &quot;security&quot; associated with the election is supposedly....according to this.....easily hackable and apparently untraceable until after the fact.  They didn&#39;t warn anyone......and if they did know, their claim is that they didn&#39;t know enough to say anything??  Laughable.  Even if they could tell things were afoot, they didn&#39;t say anything.....no whistle blown, not even with a warning things could be manipulated by a foreign country.  That&#39;s not a small thing</p>

<p>There is no security.  Not really, its only there when its convenient for the establishment.</p>

<p>Even if the Russian hacking BS was true, it just means the intelligence world in the US cannot and could not stop it from happening.  </p>

<p>Or the alternate is true, and they let it happen and this is all a big ruse and scam.  My money is on the scam.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nearly 60% of people registered to vote didn&#39;t even vote in the presidential election. How many of those broken machines affected a Hillary supporter too? </p>

<p>Can&#39;t read the WaPo one, they hate my adblock. </p>

<p>It&#39;s hard enough getting people to vote for president let alone take time out of the day to vote for the nominee. Do you think more older people voted in the primary or younger people?</p>
