       They wouldn't host subreddits such as r/The_Donald, r/Conservative, r/sjwhate, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are a tons of conservative and anti-liberals subs, so I don't see how the Admins are censoring conservative narrative tbh.
      </p>
      <p>
       The demographic of Reddit is rather young, which explains in itself the inclination toward "left-oriented" views in the content.

       Reddit Admins recently banned a mod from
       <a href="/r/The_Donald">
        /r/The_Donald
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Point to one subreddit where PizzaGate can be researched and discussed that hasn't had it's moderator team replaced by Reddit admins.  If you say
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       , then point to one post containing original research, all of it had to move off Reddit and is now being conducted mostly on voat, go talk to them if you are interested in the truth.

       T_D was making it to
       <a href="/r/all">
        /r/all
       </a>
       under the existing algorithms then they kept changing them &amp; ultimately removed T_D from
       <a href="/r/all">
        /r/all
       </a>
       .  Then
       <a href="/u/enoughtrumpspam">

       &amp;
       <a href="/r/esist">
        /r/esist
       </a>
       among other became frequent.  If reddit is as young as you say it is that doesnt make sense.  It also doesnt explain why ads.reddit.com advertised that T_D had 6 mil subscribers which puts it on par w/ the defaults &amp; is impressive for such a new sub.  But the public counter sits at 400k*+.  Then after T_D found that shit that changed it to 28 mil monthly views or some shit.  Its illegal to lie to people paying u to advertise so that is suspicious.  There were other subs that ads.reddit.com had discrepancies from what they were telling advertisers.

         You're living in a free-market economy, where companies can set their own set of rules regarding the content they host. If you're disgruntled by this situation, you can create your own website designed exclusively for Trump supporters.

       <li>
        <p>
         Since T_D is a subreddit where mods ban any dissident opinions, I think it's only logic that it won't appear on r/all.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Reddit lost a large number of users when T_D dominated r/all, maybe the Admins wanted to prevent this from happening again.

         Speaking for myself, I'm not personally inclined to the type of simplistic discourse on r/the_donald. For instance, Pepe memes 24/7, , Praise Kek, Libtards are evil, HisNameWasSethRich, etc. That's not like if this subreddit was made to encourage debates, constructive discussions, sharing new ideas, etc. That's basically an echo-chamber with implanted ideas and a prescribed narrative.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         You have to accept that the majority of Reddit is simply not interested as you are to this type of circlejerk.

       If they were 6 million real subscribres to t_d, the why could they only get 13,000 people to go to Voat? That is a success rate of 0.21%.
Why would they only get 47k people around American to sign the petition on Seth Rich?  A success rate of 0.73%. Given this information of t_d activity outside of reddit, we then can conclude that t_d has a total of between 15~50k actual members.

         You're living in a free-market economy, where companies can set their own set of rules regarding the content they host. If you're disgruntled by this situation, you can create your own website designed exclusively for Trump supporters.

         Since T_D is a subreddit where mods ban any dissident opinions, I think it's only logic that it won't appear on r/all.

         Reddit lost a large number of users when T_D dominated r/all, maybe the Admins wanted to prevent this from happening again.

         I have yet to see any list of subreddits presented by the admins with the directive of harassing their users. Maybe you can provide a proof to back your claim.

       As a liberal, I say no and this is not suppose to be a place to post simple political attacks it is a place to post about conspiracies.
      </p>
      <p>
       Many of the conspiracies, like the lies we are told about human history are not liberal or conservative,
      </p>
      <p>
       The same could be said about the Alien or Illuminati conspiracies.
      </p>
      <p>
       Certainly some conspiracies are political, like the assassinations of the 60s.
      </p>
      <p>
       But this is not a planned partisan (partisan meaning political party aligned) sub.

       Yes, there's a site-wide operation to curate public opinion and yes it's politically motivated very far to the left.
      </p>
      <p>
       Remember when people used to say reddit needed to learn how to make money? And how people don't say that anymore? Corporate learned and now they sell community product-placement on a massive scale sitewide.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Democratic National Convention (or perhaps disgruntled Hill-financeers) are willing to put up a lot of cash to keep the anti-trump agenda on track. This site especially has been seriously impacted by these groups, first Bernie (who's popularity was unfortunately the result of a successful and strategic public relations / digital reputation management campaign) then Hillary now anything anti-republican.

       Hillary Clinton is not "very far to the left". Bernie Sanders would be called center-left in most of the world and even he's much further left than the "site-wide operation to curate public opinion" (i.e., Democratic Party astroturfing) would allow.

       Translating, Ive never said anything offensive in this said community, but somehow the system acknowledged that I post to subs where their troublemakers come from.

       There's no conspiracy it's just that Republicans are really really dumb and they are a minority, the only reason they hold any office at all this because of gerrymandering and the Electoral College and voter suppression. They cannot win without cheating because they do not represent normal thinking people.
