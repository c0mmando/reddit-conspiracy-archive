       So your first comment or post ever is a post in a conspiracy thread that denounces a conspiracy theory that probably 80-90% of users would consider an entry level topic.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Thoroughly dismantles" really because the few minutes I was able to suffer through consisted of petty and relentlessly silly questions from a guy who isn't even familiar with the arguments he is refuting.

       I've spent the last few hours sifting thru all the documents, crime scene photos, evidence tags, police reports and such related to the Sandy Hook shooting... Piles and piles of official PDFs are stashed over at
       <a href="http://cspsandyhookreport.ct.gov/">
        http://cspsandyhookreport.ct.gov/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Despite some of the anomalies I've seen in Youtube videos it looks like it was a legit shooting by a mentally troubled well off kid that really really loved guns his whole life.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only "conspiracy" related thing I saw in the piles and piles of info... was the fact that he pulled the hard drive out of his computer, smashed it open and scratched the platter all up... and the fact that there was a whole file full of accusations that perhaps Adam Lanza had been driven to go on a murderous rampage because of "The Hum"... like... an oddly large amount of documentation on "The Hum"...
      </p>
      <p>
       A few articles mentioned it in relation to the shooting, but I'm surprised at how much real estate the idea ate up in their file dumps...

       Spend a couple hours pawing thru the files at that first link I posted and lemme know when the evidence starts to veer away from reality and starts pointing towards hoax. I'm as skeptical as the next guy... but a couple of anomalies pointed out in random YouTube videos isn't enough to steer me away from the mountains of legit evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       The dummy drag and SWAT guy jumping out the window make no sense to me... but everything else in the files is right on the money.

       Spattered in blood? Nice try. The amount of blood shown in the photos wouldn't fill a shot glass.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most of the blood is visible in the doorway of the conference room…a room with no locked door and a huge window that the shooter never even attempted to enter. A door that victims leaned up against to keep the shooter out…except the door opens into the hallway.
      </p>
      <p>
       Are you aware the bullet wound was inflicted behind the right ear and it went up through the head into the ceiling…except in the coroners report labels it as "intra-oral"…through the mouth.
      </p>
      <p>
       The body was found in a classroom except that Vance, to the media, at the end of the day says he was found in the hallway.

       There was some bloody hair poking thru the bullet hole in the hat... You could still blow a hole in in the top of your head if you stuck a gun on your mouth.
      </p>
      <p>
       There was blood in the crime scene photos, but all of the ones featuring dead bodies were entirely redacted, though the database of photos describes what was in the redacted photos... I'm guessing the interior of the 3 classrooms is where the majority of the blood would have been located.
      </p>
      <p>
       Too much detailed documentation for it to be a hoax... I know that's not what the cool kids think, but from the piles of reports I've been thru I don't see any glaring contradictions within the files I've already consumed. I still have piles more to go though...

       I'm just reading the official documents... I'm not out there doing a Bing search for Newtown Bee archives. Minor contradictions can often be chalked up to early reports containing flawed information... or just plain old human error. The reports give me a pretty large swath of information that all jives together... I think a troubled gun nut rich kid went crazy and shot up a whole buncha kids.

       Ahhh…I see…so you're examining a possible conspiracy by exclusively relying on gov reports. I'm sure that will reveal all the truth you wish to find.

      <p>
       I'm not required to have an alternative explanation to have serious concerns or doubts about the official story.
      </p>
      <p>
       The truth is you haven't seen one single piece of independently verifiable evidence that Adam Lanza killed 27 people. You have read a narrative provided by gov officials…and you think you've "investigated" something.

       Yeah... I trust government documents that have been filtered through all the appropriate agencies more than I trust a youtube video about a fuckin' Bing search. That's just how I roll... I could accept that this whole thing was a hoax... but the sheer amount of people that would need to be involved is insane and would need to run the gamut of a dozen different compromised agencies.
      </p>
      <p>
       The evidence in these files outweighs anything I've seen on this board or anywhere else on the internet... if you've got some smoking gun evidence I'd love to see it. I was always skeptical about what really happened there, but these guys have all their ducks in a row... Looks like the case was handled by professionals and nothing was swept under the rug to me.
      </p>
      <p>
       I still wanna know what you think happened... do you even think Adam Lanza was involved at all? Do you even think he ever existed?

       You haven't researched anything. I'm sure if you just read the Warren Commission Report it's pretty clear Oswald acted alone…and I'm sure all their ducks are in a row, too…oh, wait…except for that funky bullet…and the convicting eye witness accounts…eh, but who cares about details.
      </p>
      <p>
       You're on a conspiracy sub talking about trusting gov docs to the exclusion of everything else…and that's how you roll.

       I haven't read the Warren Commission Report, but I have read the 9/11 Commission Report... I know where I am. And in the end yer not gonna convince me to believe some crackpot on Youtube over the official governmental documents... if you have some smoking gun evidence I'd be happy to look it over. But ya haven't really come up with any valid arguments as to why the official documents do not reflect reality... you don't have any evidence... or even suggestions as to what you think actually happened. Ya just kinda come off as one of those guys that thinks everyone else is Sheeple... but have long forgot why you think like that.
      </p>
      <p>
       You got some good evidence then lay it on me... I'm open to changing my mind... but you gotta come up with something... you haven't even postulated an alternative to the official narrative yet... you act like the reports are all fake... but don't have any statements in regards to what you think "actually" happened.

       You misunderstand. My goal is not to convince you of anything. Rather it is to simply show those that come after us that you have nothing to show that the official report bears any resemblance to reality.
      </p>
      <p>
       When you get to the part of the report that details how not one single parent or loved one personally identified any victim by photo or by any other means get back to me and let me know whether that troubles you. Or if it troubles you that at least some parents confirm being told they would not be
       <em>
        allowed
       </em>
       to see their deceased loved ones.
      </p>
      <p>
       Unfortunately your stance on all this is born out of belief rather than an actual willingness to examine all available info so I highly doubt anything you find will sway that belief.

       I guess you just have access to resources I don't have... I'd reconsider my opinion if you could offer up anything for me to read... a link to something that isn't a YouTube video... or even a theory as to what you think actually happened... cause all you says is that my opinion is wrong... while not having an opinion of your own.
      </p>
      <p>
       I just don't get what you think happened... cause you think that maybe no one was actually killed... but the parents weren't allowed to see their dead kids... soooooo... They were all kidnapped instead of shot? I can totally understand not trusting an official narrative... but ya gotta kinda trust it until you have some better theory as to what actually happened... which apparently you do not... cause all you do is say the reports are bullshit... but offer no alternative narrative for me to consider.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you post on this sub very often? Cause I usually don't run into your kind of conspiracy theorist... the kind that just shoots down someones beliefs, but unwilling to share their own. Most are eager to let others know what they think and why.

       The report isn't "evidence". It is a narrative describing evidence. Evidence that in many cases is incorrect or contradicted in other areas of the report. If those factual inaccuracies and contradictions don't concern you that's of no concern of mine.
      </p>

       All you have is opinion and beliefs. Neither of those would be at all useful in a prosecution against Lanza.

       Well... whatever you have got... feel free to share it with me... or even give me the slightest hint of what you think actually happened. Cause right now you haven't got a "theory" of your own... you've just ended up being an argumentative waste of time without a conspiracy theory.

       Are you aware that in a court of law a defence attorney has no requirement/obligation to provide an alternate theory to exonerate their client?
      </p>
      <p>
       Defence attorneys collect contradictory evidence in an effort to provide reasonable doubt as to the validity of prosecution claims. The fact that you seem to require an alternative theory to recognize the contradictions in this case says much about your willingness to examine all aspects.

       I dunno what to examine... you aren't giving much help here. I'm not a lawyer... I'm just a dude reading some PDFs... and I don't see anything that is glaringly contradictory in what I have. We're not in a court of law... we're on a conspiracy theory forum... and neither of us have a conspiracy... but at least I have a theory.

       The investigation has been over 4 years in the making. If you, in that time, have only found yourself looking at the official report I'm not about to start directing you to other avenues of investigation...of which there are many.
      </p>
      <p>
       Frankly I find it pretty odd that you would have such a definite opinion on what transpired that day if all you have examined is the State Police report. But, it seems to be all you require to form your opinion.

       Oh I have watched plenty of YouTube videos about it in the past and I felt like something was up... the dummy dragging and the SWAT team dude jumping out the window for no reason and the really bad "actor" guy playing a total nutcase for every TV channel... But now after reviewing these documents I'm leaning the other way... I'm buying into the official narrative.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I find is odd is how like this is the only conspiracy you have any interest in... but you don't actually have any theory about it... aside from you think I'm wrong... you should look into the Flat Earth stuff... your posturing reminds me a lot of those type of guys.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you've got anything to provide of value to me, I'd be more than happy to review it... but I feel like you don't... I feel like Sandy Hoax is your training wheels conspiracy theory and you don't have the time or interest to really dig into any other ones.

       Your attempts at ridicule have zero effect on me. During our conversation I have provided several concerning discrepancies…you have chosen to totally ignore them.
      </p>

       You make far too many assumptions to be taken seriously. This is the only conspiracy I'm interested in? Just how have you come to that conclusion, I wonder?

       And then injecting flat earth into the discussion. Drivel…much like the official report…and this debate.
