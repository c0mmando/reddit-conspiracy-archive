    <div class="md"><p>Not sure I&#39;d jump the conclusion that every attack is a false flag - especially with zero evidence to support the theory.</p>

<p>However, yes. Theresa May is certainly using it as an excuse to attempt to censor the internet that is hurting her so much right now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just want to take a moment to point out that false flag doesn&#39;t mean the attack was fake or that the victims are not real. There is a type of false flag where this is true, where everything is an act. But false flags can also be real crimes with real victims, where the government pins the blame on someone convenient. Also false flags where the government grooms someone mentally unstable think about committing heinous crimes and the provides them with the resources to do them. </p>

<p>Take the Portland Christmas Tree Bomber for example. If that bomb went off it would&#39;ve been a disaster.  It didn&#39;t go off because it was a dud given to the bomber by the FBI who also trained him and helped him plan the attack.</p>

<p>There is some suspicion that the powers that be train all sorts of extremists and then pick and choose which of their plots will ever see the light of day and which will be real or conveniently stopped at the last minute.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not referring to matter of fact in anyway, posing it as a question for thoughtful discussion , sorry for the confusion. </p>

<p>Seems to me that if even one or two of these events is used by the powers that be to manipulate public opinion and gain control of a massive freedom humanity is currently evolving with, that should be open for discussion. Our government and corporations shouldn&#39;t be our masters and if they are using events and capitalizing on public fear and their control of the mass media.</p>

<p>People don&#39;t believe the mainstream anymore, hence the drive for control of the internet , ie uncontrollable news sources. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.freepress.net/ownership/chart">https://www.freepress.net/ownership/chart</a></p>

<p>With all the internet and technology can&#39;t we switch now to giving the people full control again in a way? Like what if we have a republic, and states get more control and people vote for laws and regulations in their respective areas, keep baseline laws and rules , but allow us the people to vote on what we want our taxes and government to be doing for us. We can vote via cellphone or compute, just upgrade the security systems and have counterhackers and try to ensure integrity and the voice and power of the people in the people&#39;s hands.</p>
