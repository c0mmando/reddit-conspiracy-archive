As your linked posts mentioned long time users can notice a change and spot the bullshit. Your conspiracy regulars are also critical thinkers that can spot this on either side; unfortunately because shills hold the cards (vote manipulation and echoing off eachother)you can&#39;t really argue with shills without being framed as &#39;wrong.&#39; </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Such as? There have been multiple stickies over the weeks explaining the situation and how as a community we can stop it. There are threads on how shill conglomerates behave and how they takeover subs. In the midst of all this they were still able to vote in some fresh mods (which seem aok to me) to try and combat the invasion.</p>

<p>We&#39;re all aware. the mods would shoot themselves on the foot banning anyone. For instance even if they banned a legit shill that shill would take that screen cap, post it in his own shill echochamber (whatever leftist or smear sub r/topmindsofreddit etc) and destroy our image anyway.</p>

<p>In fact I would go so far as to say the thrice weekly threads only serve to turn us against our benevolent mod overlords. </p>

<p>This is a factual statement, not an argument. What&#39;s the standard deviation of voting on a post based on time and position? You have to define those things before criticizing me.</p>

<p>On a comment at the bottom of the page where no one can see it, normal range is around 0-2, and standard deviation is like 1 (if that).</p>

<p>If you see a reply to a comment at the bottom of the page that has +90 where no one can even see it, you&#39;re well past 6 standard deviations. You&#39;re into &quot;no way in hell&quot; territory.</p>

<p>At 6 sds, you are... CLEARLY in the &quot;no way in hell&quot; territory, so it makes me suspicious of the sd calculation. I need a source.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying that you are wrong about bots... they are clearly here, but most modern bots are aware of statisticians and their methods, and they do a better job of disguising themselves, statistically.</p>

<p>Plus, you are applying standard deviation to a curve that doesn&#39;t look normal to me. Normal curves are symmetric. This is clearly a steep curve on the left, at zero, and a shallow curve down on the right.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh yeah... for the 1000 to 10000 votes thing... I&#39;m talking about establishing the standard deviation, so you can use it as a baseline to say, &quot;THAT&#39;s 6sd&#39;s away.&quot;</p>

<p>It is difficult to get such a baseline because every community has such divergent posting/voting habits. You would ideally want a <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> dataset that you knew was not botted, and it should be large... 10k-10m comments to establish if there is a predictable curve, even if it is not normal.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure how you would collect the baseline to do regressions against.</p>
