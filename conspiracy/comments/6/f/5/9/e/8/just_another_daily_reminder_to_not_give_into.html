        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>In light of the recent Manchester Bombings as well as today&#39;s terrorist attack in London today, don&#39;t let fearporn dictate your life. Be vigilant and stay safe out there but never give into fear or fall for the war on terror propaganda that sadly some alternative media outlets have fallen to. :(</p>

<p>I don&#39;t care if people condemn Islam or are critical Islam, I&#39;m open to debate with Islam and the issues behind the religion, but that&#39;s not the point of this post. You&#39;re being conned on both sides, you have the alt-right and antifa and the so called &quot;alt-media&quot; which regurgitates disinformation and leads people into this &quot;go ahead and hate your neighbor&quot; type of mentality to the point that I see posts from even people that I use to look up to and they are bragging about &quot;giving leftists helicopter rides&quot; i.e. throw them out of helicopters ale Pinochet style. Both the social justice warriors and the alt-right are just tools of the deep state and the system itself. </p>

<p>I maybe using the same message from my first post I made on here but its still an important message for those that believe in a open society and a society governed by free humanity. Don&#39;t ever beg or wish for your rights to be taken away. You may never get them back. </p>

<p>It&#39;s fine to have closed borders, I don&#39;t support open borders and I am not a social justice warrior, and not everything Trump does is bad, but don&#39;t be conned by the police state propaganda. </p>

<p>My heart goes out for the people of London but please fellow Brits don&#39;t forfeit your rights. </p>

<p>The only reason to stage an event now are that May&#39;s conservative government numbers are in the toilet, and they definitely want the agenda of Brexit and a Torie re-election. </p>

<p>How is that in anyways an open border?</p>

<p>This is the only topic that made it to the front page of r/conspiracy today, on the day of one of the biggest terrorist events in recent times. </p>

<p>Who runs this sub? It&#39;s like the NWO totally dominates the conspiracy movement now, and Trumpist/Libertarian/Alt-Right lackys for the NWO bleat about NWO want open borders... Are you serious???</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know man, the entire global media and globalist elites seem dead set on targeting the alt-right more than anything. I don&#39;t think they would try so hard to suppress them if they are simply another tool, I think they are a threat. The movement is labeled as racist, sexist, xenophobic, etc. when the reality is it is a broad movement with many different characters. However, everyone in the movement tends to adhere to the key the principles of nationalism, race-realism (much different from racism), and free speech over all else (but particularly anti-political correctness).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m sorry but the alt-right is not exclusive to white supremacists. Does it include them? Sure, it offers them a platform just like far-left platforms inevitably attract communists, anarchists, and the like. There are many activists like Jared Taylor who consider themselves alt-right but are not racist at all. They simply rally around the ideas of nationalism, race-realism, and free speech. It&#39;s a very broad movement and to paint them all with one convenient description in order to alienate their existence is unfair and intellectually dishonest.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s where it came from, and as I said it was a rebranding too.</p>

<p>Jared Taylor is most definitely a white supremacist and those terms you mention aren&#39;t even dog whistles most of the time, they&#39;re blatant.</p>

<p>Some people are naive and miss this, which is the whole point - to appear more legitimate and grow.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Jared Taylor has repeatedly refused to be labeled as a white supremacist and none of his words or actions indicate such. He simply recognises the cultural, morphological, and intellectual differences between the races and that people should strive to be homogenous in order to promote unity and individuality to the furthest extent possible.</p>

<p>In some of his interviews he has acknowledged that Asians are on average smarter than whites, and whites smarter than Africans, but that intelligence doesn&#39;t make one race superior over another. Crime rates, for instance, are also much different among the races. He uses things like that to illustrate the differencens between different groups rather than as a talking point for supremacy. Africans should be proud to be Africans, Asians to be Asians, and Caucasians to be Caucasians. Pretty reasonable.</p>

<p>Of course the globalists hate this because it goes against their agenda of interbreeding to establish one muddled race and destroy individuality. One race, one government, one collective hive mind. So when that agenda is threatened by a movement like the alt-right they will label them with one broad stroke as unabashedly racist and any other &quot;ist&quot; you can think of. </p>

<p>Like I said, the alt-right <em>does</em> include true white supremacists simply because with a platform dealing with race and nationalism it is inevitable, but it is not exclusive to those types, nor do they really have a majority save for online Internet forums which a lot of edgy teens frequent. There are some like Milo Yiannopoulos, one of the most popular activists in the movement, who the media have called the &quot;leader&quot; of the alt-right but he is a gay Jew with a black boyfriend. Pretty contradictory behavior that just unveils their true intentions.</p>

<p>Yes, a sub is not the same thing as a country, but I feel like the desire for protection is similar. If a bomb went off in my hometown and killed people, I probably would support a little more security in the name of protection and safety, at least for a little while.

    <div class="md"><p>There is no alt right.</p>

<p>Most didn&#39;t even knew what alt-right or the term &quot;fake news&quot; or Richard Spencer even was until after Trump won the election and the left needed a boogie man. Who would have even heard about Richard Spencer if the MSM, which leans left, didn&#39;t start shoving him down our faces starting a week after the election. Just like Breitbart news—no one I knows even reads Breitbart news and have never even heard of it. Most people wouldn&#39;t if not for Democrats bringing it up as their needed boogie man.</p>

<p>People are such sheep they actually think that between Obama leaving office and Trump taking office—mere months—that suddenly we have this scary &quot;alt right&quot; problem and white supremacy is on the rise and yada yada yada. It&#39;s bullshit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My buddy recently showed me portion of a Charles Barkley interview with Spencer. They are giving him so much credit, it&#39;s ridiculous. I guess the whole series was created to stir up this narrative but I won&#39;t be watching the shit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Most people don&#39;t understand what&#39;s going on—no critical thinking whatsoever. </p>

<p>&quot;Why is the mainstream media suddenly pushing this Richard Spencer on us after the election? Why should we care?&quot;</p>

<p>If the mainstream media didn&#39;t give him a platform no one would even know who Spencer is.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think some people got some things wrong with what I was saying, perhaps you are right that there is no alt-right but they are heavily empathized by the media and I agree there is no explosion of neo-Nazi sentiments or white supremacy despite what some left wing platforms will have you believe. </p>

<p>However going back on the police state angle, the very powers that be that allowed this to happen, or I should say Theresa May has now come out in favor of regulating the internet. So it&#39;s okay when terrorists attack us and we have to give up our rights so as we don&#39;t offend the Islamists in order to break down society, but it&#39;s not okay to criticize the terrorists? Also, I agree that it&#39;s not inherently wrong to have a little extra security after an attack, but don&#39;t use the Boston example from 2013 as a pretext to shut down the city all in the name of fighting the ISIS boogeyman. </p>
