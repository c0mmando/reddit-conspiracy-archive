        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>E: This is being HEAVILY downvoted by design. It was on the front page, and is now slowly and incrementally diving. </p>

<p>What the fuck is going on in this sub? </p>

<p>All this inorganic and disingenious support for Donald Trump? </p>

<p>I always thought the mission statement for conspiracy theorists was, </p>

<p>&quot;Expose the plot to create a global new world order. Government is organized crime, and <strong>political parties are a tool used to divide the people. Presidents are merely installed &quot;assets&quot; that claim to to the bidding of the people, whilst doing the bidding of the elite</strong>&quot;.</p>

<p>Why are so many of us ignoring this? To be quite honest, i&#39;d prefer to see no or very litte debate on political parties and political preference. Just seems like a bunch of &quot;hoopla&quot; to me, ya know?</p>

<p>They rig these elections so that both primaries are fixed with a puppet who is signed onto the agenda. What makes you think Trump is any different?</p>

<p>Now, it seems the entire resources of this sub are dedicated to a &#39;hunt&#39; regarding the DNC crimes. Hillary Clinton is without a doubt one of the most crooked and vile politicians on the planet. <strong>However, she <em>lost</em> the election and she should no longer be the focal point of our movement.</strong> Seth Rich deserves justice for his courageous act of leaking those documents, and I have NO DOUBT he was the leaker. So why is it still &quot;hillary this, hillary that. Debbie this, DNC that&quot;? </p>

<p>But I can&#39;t help feeling like we&#39;re getting nowhere, and being led on a political <strong>&quot;snipe hunt&quot;</strong> that makes us appear VERY partisan, as we ignore most of Trumps shenanigans.  Even worse, some defend his presidency. For what? What has he done to give you the benefit of the doubt, that this entire system of rigged primaries, rigged elections, all of a sudden came to a halt this year? Does the system seem to have a problem with him? He seems to get along very well with the Saudi&#39;s, Israel, the CIA (who he claimed he was behind 1000%, link below) Everything seems to be chugging along like usual within the first 6 months honestly. The real &quot;good shit&quot; where they start usurping our constitutional rights is coming up soon...They&#39;re letting the dust settle right now.</p>

<p>Having the entire conspiracy community, (unfortunately) largely still led by Alex Jones  and his &quot;new found love for conservative values&quot;, ONLY pursue democratic crimes, makes us look partisan as hell. <strong>I&#39;m starting to think this is part of a larger plan to destroy the resistance movement...I don&#39;t trust Jones anymore either.</strong></p>

<p>I think the establishment <em>wants</em> us to trust trump and have faith in him. They are the ones creating and pushing his &quot;anti establishment&quot; appeal. This is beneficial to them, because now they have a HUGE block of his critics on their team now: Conspiracy Theorists.</p>

<p>Just because we think the Russia Story conspiracy is fake, does NOT mean this guy is still at the helm of the New World Order ship. </p>

<p>If we&#39;re going to pretend to be nonpartisan, which I still truly think is a HUGE defining characteristic of being a critical thinker and a conspiracy theorist, we need to at least acknowledge the corruption on the <em>other side</em> as well, eh?.....</p>

<p>Lastly......</p>

<p>If the sub goes down because of this? It will suck. But I&#39;m more worried about the BIG picture. <strong>What you&#39;re seeing with this slow inching of this sub toward conservative politics and republican ideals, is happening on a much LARGER scale in the real world</strong>. They are subverting our effectiveness as a resistance to their tyranny, by sucking us as theorists, into the fucking political paradigm. Their destroying our non-partisan appeal by design. Wake up, please....Before it&#39;s too late.</p>

<p>.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: Also, And remember when Trump called out Rand Paul specifically on stage during the debate to turn all his supporters against him? They knew Rand was the anti establishment guy, and Trump had already been picked in advance. He did it on live tv just to shit all over him and make sure he didn&#39;t get in the way of their plan...</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0V1LcpsNDfg">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0V1LcpsNDfg</a></p>

<p><strong>Trump to CIA &quot; I&#39;m with you all the way, 1000%&quot;</strong></p>

<p>Plus he still talks about the &quot;terrorism&quot; boogeyman as if it&#39;s a real thing lol...We all know 9/11 was faked and that &quot;terrorism&quot; is an invisible entity of an enemy, it&#39;s an &quot;idea&quot; that can&#39;t be defeated. Perfect excuse for them to strip us of our civil liberties, and Trump is helping prop up this charade.</p>

<p>I feel like my 6 year old son could tell this guy is lying. He&#39;s almost as obvious as George W Bush...</p>

<p>The organic trump support is dwindling. I&#39;d say maybe 10% of pro trump shit here is organic. The rest are shills pushing this little facade. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Honest question? Where have I distorted facts with my &quot;blind hated&quot;? If you truly read my posts, you&#39;d know that I hate corrupt, corporate (D) just as much as corrupt (R). Trump has shown his true colors with this globalist, corrupt policies. </p>

<p>I said I&#39;d be out marching <em>for</em> Trump if he vetoed the anti-Internet Privacy bill. I&#39;d be supporting him, if his budget helped fix our aging infrastructure instead of giving the top  1% a Trillion dollar tax cut. </p>

<p>The problem I see with the government is it&#39;s controlled by bankers and corporatists. Trump actions have shown him to be part of the problem. Good luck finding someone &quot;neutral&quot; that follows politics closely. My only &quot;side&quot; is truth and anti-corruption. If I appear anti-Trump is&#39;t because he&#39;s playing against that side. </p>

<p>There are no GOP leaks. We have the DNC leaks with thousands of emails and concrete proof of the DNC&#39;s corrupt actions. </p>

<p>If we had GOP documents to read, that would have been an entirely different story. </p>

<p>But saying this is some one sided issue in my eyes is passing the buck. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>At the end of the day, we have a SERIOUS economic and social collapse coming at us within the next 4-8 years</p>

<p>USA is economically stronger than ever before, the national debt clock is going in reverse right now. </p>

<p>Look in the lower left hand corner. <a href="http://www.usdebtclock.org/">http://www.usdebtclock.org/</a></p>

<p>The GAAP is doing down and so it the US Federal Budget Deficit. That&#39;s never happened since the website launched. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>We also just uncovered undeniable proof of sex trafficking and pedophilia among the elites of our society, why are we not pursuing and trying to awaken the masses as to these things that could actually bring this cabal down?</p>

<p>You should thank for Trump for allowing this to happen, his people are on the front lines of that fight. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>We should still be shouting from the rooftops that 9/11 was a fucking inside job...If the people found out about that?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Democrats AND Republicans / foreign agents / our intelligence agents are ALL behind that. </p>

<p>Let&#39;s give this a whirl: The RNC ripped, tore and shredded Dr. Ron Paul via <strong>Rinse Pubics</strong> and Dr. Rand Paul threw his own father under the bus!</p>

<p>Karl Rove is an evil nerdy little psycho that has had his stinky fingers in Diebold Voting Machines to line his pockets. He&#39;s a huge factor in the Money Laundering Schemes for Drugs, Guns and bababies. He&#39;s really slimy if people are interested in digging dirt.</p>

<p>Papa Bush is a serial rapist, assassin and W is just a drunk twinky. </p>

<p>Plenty of us were screaming about the Franklin Case but then we realized that damned near every single elected official is a dirty stinking PEDERAST, closet homosexual raging evangelist, coke snorting Pimp etc.</p>

<p>Any questions?</p>

He co-sponsored the bill that took away rules preventing ISPs from selling your data, then conveniently didn&#39;t vote on it, but it still passed unanimously among Republicans. Now, he has been grandstanding about &#39;blocking&#39; the Saudi arms deal, but in reality is only trying to block 500 million of the 110 billion dollar sale (.45%), to make himself appear to be the &#39;anti-establishment Republican. Rand Paul is a liar.</p>

<p>Watch the debates. Rand Grilled all the GOP nominees on the fed, immigration, drug war, medical marijuana, ect. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>...seeing these posts over the course of the last few weeks are weird af. Like they morph, but they have the same undertones every time. Why would we get Trump out of office? Whoever he gets replaced with would be another puppet, why do you think the media only covers Republicans and Democrats during election seasons? Because they&#39;re the people who are networked in, other third party candidates aren&#39;t part of the club because their integrity would get it the way. </p>

<p>Party corruption isn&#39;t worth focusing on because they&#39;ll remain corrupt until they&#39;re collectively shut down or called out, both parties. Seth Rich was a dude that loved his country, genuinely, he wanted to make this country a better place for everyone, and he was possibly killed for it. If we can find out and prove who did it, it would provide a bit of justice for him and his family, alongside being able to show people just how fucked up this system is. They will kill innocent, honest people to keep their lies afloat, that is not a system we should blindly contribute to. The DNC is simply an arm to a bigger monster, no decision was made exclusively to benefit the &#39;party.&#39; If there is proof then people may feel uncomfortable enough to do something about all of this.  That&#39;s how I feel about this right now. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The secret system is stiil in place, of course. Do people not see that the sham two party system is based on a highly architected good cop, bad cop, psychology, with the Democrats evidently being the more humane good cops, and the Republicans being the more sadistic bad cops? This artificial binary system reduces the complexity of really occurring political structures and systems to lowest common democratic denominators, that serve far more to repress democratic societal evolution instead of simply reflecting it, i.e. the two party binary is a consciously designed regulator of popular democratic will, sovereignty, and evolution. It serves to incite, direct, but also to repress, all to the tune of an ever more oligarchic capitalism&#39;s direction. The Republican party is largely constituted by actors who consciously or unwittingly play the role of stern, punitive, disciplinarian bad cops, because psychological science has determined that potentially decisive pluralities respond reflexively to this image, the Democratic party presents the maternal, more feminine, caring and accepting face of capitalism, for the same studied but superficial reasons that motivate the Republicans, ultimately both work synergistically to define and control the image and discourse of what is societally possible for the purposes of the retention of power within a reduced apex of individuals that have exceedingly far more in common among themselves then they do with the stultifyingly partisanized masses they ostensibly represent. The elite seeks power for itself not only for obvious financial rewards and familial aggrandizement, but also and equally because, as Kissinger so rightly noted, power is the ultimate aphrodisiac, the highest peak of human pleasure and experience, to be able to command the minds&#39; of millions is a power that has no equal in the individual psychological experiences of man. Without reduced and exclusionary power the entire imperial and warlike American structure falls apart, and America &quot;descends&quot; to the level of political democratic normalcy as comparatively represented by the rest of the advanced Western democracies. America is Europe&#39;s id (and this is why Trump is so supremely representative of it), the last remaining aggressor state sprung from the ancient and seemingly eternal example of the Roman imperium, whose various reiterations, from Charlemagne onwards have inspired visions of global domination, incipiently and consistently under the evangelizing banner of the cross, and now under the equally evangelizing banner of neoliberalism, should the rest of the world simply accept domination by a power that fundamentally perceives itself as an inheritor of the ancient Roman imperium, one that was and is supremely elitist and simultaneously decadently manipulative (i.e. seductive) to its core?</p>

<p>There&#39;s also a huge astro-turfing campaign in support of the president, while he is attacked for every meaningless minutiae by 24-hour negative press covfefe.</p>

<p>Finally, there have been a number of email leaks coming from the DNC, but not the RNC, but that in of itself is suspicious.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Bro!!! I love this post. I wish I could upvote it more. Donald Trump is on the take, no doubt. The media is &quot;against&quot; him? Of course, it&#39;s all political theater!! He&#39;s a ratings giant!! They really love him. Him and Jones co-opted this community. Jones is a subservient lap dog to the establishment!! I really don&#39;t think Jones is nefarious. I think Trump played to Jones&#39;s ego and narcissism. Jones now has a place at the table and it was calculated by Trump and his handlers. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I downvoted because you said the GOP rigged primary against Rand Paul and there&#39;s no evidence of that. </p>

<p>Yes Rand is a better candidate but he didn&#39;t win and there&#39;s no evidence of rigging, not like the DNC. </p>

<p>Trump is a buffoon, but a buffoon is easier to stop. The establishment democrats are airing EVERY piece of info they can on trump so we already get a ton of anti GOP in MSM. They never focus on Democrats though, and they are the real wolf in sheeps clothing. </p>

<p>Republicans are running and outdated message and it&#39;s slowly dwindling. They won because democrats had NO message. Democrats are trying to position themselves as the &quot;not republican&quot; party but it&#39;s the opposite, they are actually the same. </p>

<p>So we need to remove the imposter and the GOP will continue to drown itself. We need a people&#39;s party and the democrats are in the way of that. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I doubt Rand would have actually won the GOP primary if things were run correctly. But you are right they are screwy too.</p>

<p>They gave Ron Paul a hell of a time and I do know that Ron&#39;s votes were not counted in my voting district, which had a an overwhelming amount of Ron Paul supporters. Many of us met up beforehand, and unless all those folks wearing Ron Paul shirts and sporting the bumper stickers on their cars decided at the last min they were really Romney men at heart and then faked like everything was a okay when they left the voting booth... Ron got like 12 votes according to my district, but over 60 of us showed up to vote for him specifically for the meet up. From what I was told by other voters later who voted there, there would have been even more votes. </p>

<p>I would LOVE if the GOP had gotten busted for that BS. But nothing really came of it. I think everyone here is so on board fighting for the DNC shananagains to be brought to light because there is so much evidence, because it will be easy to bring them down. We need to fight for this. When the GOP fucks up in similar ways, then we need to fight for justice there. </p>

<p>The GOP just has not flubbed this bad before, and in such a way people are actually caring. (What seems like most) Dem&#39;s love Bernie. Rand just does not have that same level of love, and while he very well might have been screwed out of some votes in the primary, people would think Rand was being a sore looser to fight over this because he simply does not have the numbers.... if that makes sense. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Honest question? Where have I distorted facts with my &quot;blind hated&quot;? If you truly read my posts, you&#39;d know that I hate corrupt, corporate (D) just as much as corrupt (R). Trump has shown his true colors with this globalist, corrupt policies. </p>

<p>I said I&#39;d be out marching <em>for</em> Trump if he vetoed the anti-Internet Privacy bill. I&#39;d be supporting him, if his budget helped fix our aging infrastructure instead of giving the top  1% a Trillion dollar tax cut. </p>

<p>The problem I see with the government is it&#39;s controlled by bankers and corporatists. Trump actions have shown him to be part of the problem. Good luck finding someone &quot;neutral&quot; that follows politics closely. My only &quot;side&quot; is truth and anti-corruption. If I appear anti-Trump is&#39;t because he&#39;s playing against that side. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh, yeah we do have a problem with new accounts astroturfing on both sides. That said the front page speaks for itself. Either Trump supporters are the silent majority, or we are being brigaded. Suspicious voting patterns like I&#39;ve found multiple times, makes me think it&#39;s the later.</p>
