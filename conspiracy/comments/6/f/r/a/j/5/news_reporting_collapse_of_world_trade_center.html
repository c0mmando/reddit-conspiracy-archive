        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>World Trade Center Building 7 was a 47-story, fireproofed, modern, steel-frame building completed in 1987, that was hit by pieces of debris from the World Trade Center towers when they collapsed on the morning of 9/11. The official government narrative claims that this debris ignited fires that burned for several hours, weakening WTC 7 until the failure of column #79 initiated a sudden universal collapse. This has long been doubted by skeptics -- notably the 2,800+ Architects and Engineers for 9/11 Truth, who insist it was brought down via controlled demolition.</p>

<p>Structural engineer Dr. Leroy Hulsey and his students at University of Alaska Fairbanks are in the midst of conclusively debunking the bogus official claims of &quot;normal office fires&quot; with their two-year study. Their report will be released in August of 2017.</p>

<p>No modern steel framed building has ever collapsed from fires, before WTC7 or since (unless you count the towers WTC 1 and 2 -- which were hit by airplanes). Oddly, there is ample evidence that many people <em>knew</em> WTC 7 was going to collapse. How was this possible? </p>

<p>Here is a list of news reports discussing the collapse before it happened.</p>

<p>Jane Standley of the BBC reported on the collapse of WTC 7 (AKA the Soloman Brother&#39;s Building) at 4:54 PM -- 26 minutes BEFORE it collapsed. The building is visibly standing behind her as she reports it has collapsed. BBC &quot;loses connection&quot; with her mid-conversation. BBC&#39;s official explanation for this was that they received an erroneous report from Reuters on a confusing day. 
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ltP2t9nq9fI">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ltP2t9nq9fI</a></p>

<p>Later, BBC contacts Standley again for a report. She describes the situation but when they bring up WTC 7 (@ 2:12), the audio cuts out. Coincidence?
<a href="https://youtu.be/gsqAHhTWEH0?t=40">https://youtu.be/gsqAHhTWEH0?t=40</a></p>

<p>CNN Report the collapse 67 minutes early:
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpWK8IwJH0w">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpWK8IwJH0w</a></p>

<p>ABC News: &quot;another building in the World Trade Center Complex, which was not struck by an airplane, is in danger of collapsing...&quot;
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaNHuwGAG1I">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaNHuwGAG1I</a></p>

<p>NBC News, reporting upcoming collapse 26 minutes early: 
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDkUZo2QVLE">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDkUZo2QVLE</a></p>

<p>CNN shows emergency workers at WTC7: 
&quot;Keep your eye on that building, that thing&#39;s comin&#39; down!&quot; 
&quot;The whole thing is about to blow up. Move it back!&quot;
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cU_43SwWD9A">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cU_43SwWD9A</a></p>

<p>Fox 5 Reports Collapse &lt; 1 min early. After reporting it collapsed, they cut to a live feed, and it comes down live on screen: 
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDDZANw9isI">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDDZANw9isI</a></p>

<p>This one is not foreknowledge, but an interesting observation from Dan Rather at CBS: 
&quot;For the third time today. Its reminiscent of those pictures we&#39;ve all seen too much on television before when a building was deliberately destroyed by well-placed dynamite.&quot;

    <div class="md"><p>They knew it was going to collapse because of reports from fire fighters.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>At approximately 2:00 pm, firefighters noticed a bulge in the southwest corner of 7 World Trade Center between the 10th and 13th floors, a sign that the building was unstable and might collapse.[37] During the afternoon, firefighters also heard creaking sounds coming from the building.[38] Around 3:30 pm, FDNY Chief Daniel A. Nigro decided to halt rescue operations, surface removal, and searches along the surface of the debris near 7 World Trade Center and evacuate the area due to concerns for the safety of personnel.[39]</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly! And that&#39;s very odd. </p>

<p>This was a totally unprecedented event. No building had ever collapsed from fires in human history. They are built to withstand fires. How could they have known?</p>

<p>Past examples:</p>

<p>1991, Philadelphia, PA – One Meridian Plaza burned for 18 hours, gutting 8 of 38 floors. A FEMA report said &quot;beams and girders sagged and twisted,&quot; but &quot;continued to support their loads without obvious damage.&quot; </p>

<p>2004, Caracas, Venezuela – Parque Central building burned for 17 hours, gutting 20 of 50 floors. It did not collapse.</p>

<p>WTC 7 was prepared for collapse, which is evident watching the footage. This would take many hours of placing explosives in advance. It fell at freefall speeds (NIST now admits this), meaning there was NO resistance from the floors below.</p>

<p>A building collapsing from internal fires would not fall suddenly and completely at freefall speeds directly into its own footprint in 7 seconds. </p>

    <div class="md"><p><strong>What Was In WTC 7?</strong></p>

<p>WTC 7 consisted exclusively of government agencies and financial institutions, including the Mayor&#39;s Office of Emergency Management, as well as Secret Service and CIA offices.</p>

<p><strong>Larry &quot;Pull it&quot; Silverstein</strong></p>

<p>Owner of the WTC buildings Larry Silverstein says that he decided loss of life in WTC 7 was so heavy that he should just &quot;pull it&quot;. Whatever that means!
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p34XrI2Fm6I">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p34XrI2Fm6I</a></p>

<p>Silverstein built and owned WTC 7 since 1985, and acquired the WTC towers in July 2001. After 9/11, he fought in court for a double insurance payment, claiming there were two terrorist &quot;occurrences.&quot; He didn&#39;t win the $7.1 billion double payment he was hoping for, but he was awarded for 1 &amp; 1/3: a payout of $4.55 billion. </p>

<p>Other interesting statements by Lucky Larry: </p>

<ul>
<li><p>his wife thankfully reminded him of his dermatology appointment on 9/11 and insisted he go, making him skip his customary breakfast at the top of WTC 1 that morning: 
<a href="https://youtu.be/9ScGZCqEyGM">https://youtu.be/9ScGZCqEyGM</a></p></li>
<li><p>Regarding the new replacement building for WTC 7, &quot;the first design meeting was in April of 2000.&quot; ... 17 months before it was destroyed?: <a href="https://youtu.be/j-_WYHwUtcI?t=28">https://youtu.be/j-_WYHwUtcI?t=28</a></p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Firefighter Foreknowledge</strong></p>

<p>At least 60 firefighters demonstrated foreknowledge of the collapse of WTC 7 at 5:20PM. More than half of them spoke in certain terms (i.e. &quot;<em>is</em>&quot; coming down” vs &quot;might&quot;). Considering no steel high-rise building in history had ever collapsed from fires (except for the Twin Towers that morning), how were they so certain that this modern, 1987, 47-story, fireproofed steel-frame building would collapse? It seems they may have been told by somebody. </p>

<p>Graeme MacQueen has looked into this a bit.</p>
