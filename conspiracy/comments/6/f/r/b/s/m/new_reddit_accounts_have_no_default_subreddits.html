    <div class="md"><p>There are some other interesting anomalies about the new r/popular as well.</p>

<p>For one thing, it has no listed moderators.</p>

<p>And yet posts are being removed from r/popular all the time.</p>

<p>There is a new bot that catches r/popular removals, &#39;underpopular&#39;. It is a very busy bot as lots of stuff seems to seems to be prevented from rising to the front page of popular.</p>

<p><a href="/r/underpopular/">/r/underpopular/</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>This isn&#39;t my fist account but <a href="/r/underpopular">/r/underpopular</a> is new to me.  Thanks for that.  I never thought about moderators.  I would assume reddit is using paid employees to moderate.  Add revenue is crucial to reddit and any losses due to unpopular political subs would be against reddit&#39;s best interest.  I&#39;m against their political agenda but,  unfortunately, it&#39;s hard to blame them.  Companies exist to make money.  Doesn&#39;t matter if you agree with that statement or not, it&#39;s the truth.</p>

<p>Seriously, I appreciate the insight.  I don&#39;t think this is my first new account since <a href="/r/popular">/r/popular</a>, but it&#39;s the first time I&#39;ve notice zero default subscriptions on a new account.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>/Popular isn&#39;t a subreddit thought, not in the traditional sense.

    <div class="md"><p>To clarify on this, until I see evidence to suggest otherwise, there are no moderators of <a href="/r/popular">/r/popular</a> because it is not a true subreddit, but a meta-subreddit similar to <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a>, which gathers posts from subs based on some algorithm (not disclosed) and filters out certain subs (also not disclosed, but reported by the admins to be based on subs which are frequently &quot;filtered&quot; on <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a> by users). </p>

<p>So, it&#39;s not that posts are removed off of <a href="/r/popular">/r/popular</a>, but posts that make <a href="/r/popular">/r/popular</a> are sometimes removed by mods of the respective sub on which it was posted, and are therefore no longer visible on <a href="/r/popular">/r/popular</a>, if that distinction makes sense.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok enough.</p>

<p>But one wonders why subreddit moderators would remove their own posts from r/popular?</p>

<p>Because if you look at the cornucopia of constantly removed posts on r/underpopular you&#39;d then have to think that subreddit moderators were constantly combing through rising posts to be sure that their own subs posts <em>don&#39;t hit the front page.</em></p>

<p>And that defies any kind of logic, it just doesn&#39;t make sense. I have to think some other kind of approved selection process is going on in r/popular.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I won&#39;t doubt that happens in some instances, but as a mod of a larger sub, I have some insight. Most mod teams don&#39;t check every post as it&#39;s made, they react to reports of rules violations (some might be different, I don&#39;t know). If we assume that a post will get reports roughly proportional to it&#39;s visibility, then it would make sense that a post which hits <a href="/r/popular">/r/popular</a> or <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a> is going to be more likely to be removed sooner than a post which is instantly downvoted to 0. </p>

<p>So in the general case, I&#39;m not too surprised by this. It looks like there were roughly 250 posts removed from the top 1000 <a href="/r/popular">/r/popular</a> posts in the last 24 hours. We&#39;d need to see more data on how many posts hit <a href="/r/popular">/r/popular</a> per day, how long a post has been up and on <a href="/r/popular">/r/popular</a> before it was removed, how many post that sub removes on average, etc. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t doubt that some of the larger subs do tend to remove a lot of posts that are popular to the userbase, and that some of them do this for nefarious reasons, but I don&#39;t think <a href="/r/underpopular">/r/underpopular</a> alone provides evidence of this. You&#39;d have to look at it more on a sub by sub basis, or a mod by mod basis, but a lot of that data isn&#39;t public. We here publish our mod logs, but most large subs do not. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow, so 25% of all posts rising in r/popular were removed? That seems pretty huge. </p>

<p>So it isn&#39;t really what is -popular- it&#39;s more like what some kind of (undisclosed) algorithms are serving up to the general public that browses reddit without a login account.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a curated front page of what reddit wants casual readers to see. It&#39;s misleading, and obviously agendized.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, that assumes each post is on <a href="/r/popular">/r/popular</a> for the whole day. Even taking out the 250 that were removed would mean at least 1250 were on for at least some portion of the day. We&#39;d have to see the data, but I&#39;d assume many of these posts are on the top 1000 of <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a> for a brief period at the lower end, and then cycle out. I&#39;m pulling this next number out of my ass, but I&#39;d guess on average between 5,000 and 10,000 posts end up on <a href="/r/popular">/r/popular</a> per day, for at least some of the day. I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if it were higher. </p>

<p>Yep. I mean honestly, it&#39;s not much worse than when it was just hand-picked default accounts. This at least allows for a bit more variety. I&#39;m not a huge fan, but it makes sense from a profit standpoint. The un-logged-in front page hasn&#39;t been decided by upvotes for years now. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is where the term &quot;fake news&#39; came from. There were sites that were completely making up news stories. And not the Fox kind of fake, more like The Onion kind of fake. Some of the bigger ones at first were making up stories going right and left. The right winged stories were getting more hits and shared more so they started to mostly write those.

    <div class="md"><p>Did you read any of the other links I provided? There is literally no record of Clinton making the pro-Trump comments that appear on &quot;The Rightists&quot; website (a website which openly admits to being a &quot;hybrid&quot; of real news and &quot;satire&quot;).</p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t matter what you think of Snopes, or what Snopes&#39; past history on other controversial matters is. In this instance, they are correct, and it is fact that you can easily verify <em>without using Snopes at all</em>, hence why I provided links to the transcript in question.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>nah.  while it was powerful, it was a talking point.  People went to bed thinking Hillary was going to be overwhelmingly voted in.  The shock of people seeing Trump as victorious was very interesting to me.</p>

<p>It is why I wonder if possibly, many that were going to vote for Hillary did not because things looked so in the bag.  Polls everywhere were golden for Hillary even though it didn&#39;t seem that way in conversations with peers.  </p>

<p>A funny example of this is on youtube, search for TYT reaction to vote counts through the night.  Man, they were freaking out negatively to it, I didn&#39;t know they were that biased until that night.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree on both parts.  I disagree with the MSM election tactis, but I was impressed with some of the narratives MSM concocted.  Luckily, they didn&#39;t pan out.  IMO their best narrative was &quot;Education disparity between voter opinions&quot; but Trump supporters weren&#39;t dumb enough to fall for that.  </p>

<p>I&#39;m a Trump supporter, albeit a skeptical and/but hopeful one, I&#39;m glad to see the silent minority wasn&#39;t swayed by MSM narratives.  I&#39;m definitely interested to see how the first 18 months is handled.  Hopefully he&#39;ll be settled in by then.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly.  I know few Hillary voters.  I&#39;m from a larger non-coast town, but most people saw through all the MSM nonsense.  Even with a Trump majority most people didn&#39;t make politics a talking point.  Where I&#39;m from this was more due to polite discord vs &quot;liberal shaming&quot;.  </p>
