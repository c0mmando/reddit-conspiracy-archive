<p>The narrative used to be that the elections could not be hacked. Suddenly it became that anyone could hack the elections.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the last thing you&#39;d ever hear a US president say is &quot;sure, our election can be hacked, it&#39;s possible.&quot; Not the kind of thing you&#39;d want to admit, particularly when Trump was claiming it could be &quot;rigged&quot; for months. I&#39;m betting the NSA is more embarrassed than anything else, not simply because the report was leaked, but that they may have missed a major operation. They weren&#39;t even able to put the report together until May apparently. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Right on brother. I tried raising this same point in a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6fkxwd/what_isnt_being_talked_about_with_regard_to_the/">similar post</a> earlier today, which got downvoted to 0 pretty quick. (I have my own hate club here, so I&#39;m not too surprised.) Hopefully yours does better. </p>

<p>But yeah, one of the biggest hypocrisies with this is when Trump was claiming the election would be rigged by the Clinton people, the left establishment was up in arms about &quot;undermining our democracy,&quot; with Obama even coming out and saying our election systems are secure and can&#39;t be hacked. Now that there&#39;s a leaked document which appears to show that <em>some</em> analysts within NSA <em>judge</em> that GRU was responsible for a phishing attack that <em>might</em> have compromised some election boards, they&#39;re running with it as if the election has been hacked. (Notice all the hedge words in what even the most liberal reading of the claims of the leak are.)</p>

<p>And this isn&#39;t me coming from a partisan angle; I&#39;ve been saying this for years now. I don&#39;t trust Trump farther than I can throw him, but this new narrative is so ridiculous in that almost no one is talking about the fundamental issue you just raised: electronic voting is not secure, and is certainly not in its current form demonstrably secure. </p>

<p>I used to, don&#39;t have as much time anymore and don&#39;t really identify as a progressive as much as I used to. I wouldn&#39;t say I&#39;m a conservative either, and still support a number of progressive ideas, but I just don&#39;t have a whole lot of faith in where I see the American progressive movement going. Still, I have a lot of respect for Hartmann; he&#39;s one of the good ones of any political persuasion. </p>

<p>I assume you brought him up because of him giving Greg Palast airtime? Another solid dude, one of the few good investigative journalists left from what seems like a bygone era. Has Palast come out with something new, or is it something else. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, not Palast - but he&#39;s fantastic.  Wish his movie had been better, amazing reporting but in way too chaotic a package.  Thom talked a bit about privatization and electronic voting while I was lisening today and it occurred to me that I have seen any coverage at all along these lines, yet it&#39;s clearly the elephant in the room.  </p>

<p>I still love listening to Thom when I can but did stop for a while following the primary when he of all people was trying to rally his listeners around Hillary, as if that would stop Trump&#39;s greasy slide into the White House.  I even called in to warn him that she couldn&#39;t win, but like everyone else, he didn&#39;t understand until it was too late.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well I&#39;m glad he brought it up, then. He&#39;s one of the few people on either side with an audience as large as he has that actually looks at the fundamental issues of our democratic institutions without just parroting the party line or talking about the horserace and cult of personality aspects. He still believes in and promotes his own policy ideas, but has a bit more depth to him. </p>

<p>This is about when I stopped, too. I can&#39;t say I didn&#39;t understand the impulse, but I just didn&#39;t find it all that interesting. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t watch or listen to anyone on TV or on the radio anymore other than Thom, for exactly the reasons you mention and his comprehensive grasp of the cultural and political underpinnings of our various current crises.  NPR is a sad joke.  The other lefty talk show hosts are either focusing entirely on the narrow slice of issues the mainstream deems OK, and/or operate in the beltway bubble.  I used to love Randi Rhodes but don&#39;t really have podcast-friendly lifestyle and the lefty station she was on where I live was replaced overnight by Clear Channel&#39;s right wing delusion mix.  On TV, I used to watch Larry Wilmore on Comedy Central - the only TV comedian who not only covered a much broader range of real world issues but devoted a lot of time to Bernie&#39;s campaign during and didn&#39;t write him off after the primary - but he promptly got canceled for his troubles.  </p>
