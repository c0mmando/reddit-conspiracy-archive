       Which means it's not a false leak but a real one. You can't have it both ways. Since it's real, then the contents are accurate and it's not "phony". Further, this means that the NSA actually believes that the Russians did what's being reported. Given that they spy on everything, then they undoubtedly know the truth.

       Or she is in on it and willing to spend years in prison for a fake leak she participated in but isn't telling anyone.

       So why bother posting a pointless statement that a whistleblower was likely doing it for the reason that most whistleblowers do it, as if by saying it somehow that makes the reasoning no longer valid.
      </p>
      <p>
       You're right, you can't have it both ways. Which is why it's funny seeing Trump supporters desperately trying to do so.

       Because it destroys the argument that this Russia stuff isn't real, which is a persistent opinion around here. If you accept that premise then either she's going to prison for a conspiracy or Russia is doing this shit.

       How does it destroy the argument? This literally proves nothing, other than she leaked something that was classified. If you read the actual document she leaked there is literally nothing conclusive in it at all that proves Trump had ties to the Russians. So she essentially leaked a document that proves nothing, and in doing so, helped create more bullshit circumstantial 'evidence' Trump's enemies can use against him. And it had the desired effect: lots of people not thinking it through, concluding this is some sort of proof, when it's not.

       Yeah I thought the same thing. How did she pass the interview and get security clearance when she was clearly an unabashed over-the-top anti-government ideologue. The only thing that makes sense, other than gross incompetence, is that they hired her to use her. Then they fed her something they knew she would leak. To validate the "it wuz Rrussians" meme.

       I agree. And let's just say this news is REAL. Russia hacked our election. The proper conversation to be having is how do we switch to paper ballots? Not how do we start a war with Russia. Every county does spy missions and tries to fuck shit up. We need to take preemptive measures to insure the security of our elections.

       Hacking the election is a hell of a claim because it insinuates that they altered vote totals which would be a major issue.
      </p>
      <p>
       What seems to be the case isn't that they "hacked the election" but that they hacked various companies that played a part in the election. It's like they hacked a Microsoft employee rather than the entire company.
