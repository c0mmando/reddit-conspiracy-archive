       Drain the swamp! What if this is exactly what he is doing? Getting rid of the Republican party by being the inside man this whole time. We know (or hope) the scums will be prosecuted and convicted. Maybe we just needed someone that seemed like such a dumbbutt that could actually make it happen. I have 2 theories: Trump is a puppet to make us overlook something else major going on OR he is the inside man to expose all the scums in government.

       Nope. You believe everything you hear about Trump, though. That's the difference. No one takes you seriously, you're a joke on this sub, and a transparent one, to boot. Enjoy your red rocket, and your name is fitting. Is your doggo named Wang, or do you just like it's Wang?

       It would be a great plot twist to the end of movie. Just to find out he was an inside man to expose all the others through his careless, yet intentional, acts. Leaning more on the side he is a bad guy, but also what is the theory the WH could spin it off this way....

       To me trump is one of three things:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         A guy with balls the size of grapefruits standing up against a historically ruthless yet unquestioned establishment.
        </p>
        <ol>
         <li>
          An actor playing the part of standing up to the establishment while the "establishment" is trashing him- thus sowing further discord into the population and creating a atmosphere of fear which will cause us to give up more rights
         </li>
         <li>
          A huge idiot running off pure ego who somehow made it all the way to the presidential office.
         </li>
        </ol>
       </li>
      </ol>

       After typing that I actually think he could easily be a combo of all three haha

       I think he started the race for notoriety and never really expected to win.
      </p>
      <p>
       When he started doing well in the primaries his ego took over and became serious about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think he's now hit upon the biggest tax evasion scam on the planet, running the government. He can use the office to enrich his empire and his rich buddies.

       I agree with those first two points but I imagine trump at somepoint maybe before or after the election-hell maybe even before he started running- someone in a black suit and shades approached him and said "if you really fuck up our stuff, we will JFK you.  You WILL play ball."

       Trump n pals are wealthy, or atleast have enough wealth generating assets, to make me believe he didn't do it TOTALLY for the money.  I think it's more like "I want all the oil from Russia so china can't have it". Like a resource cold-warfare move.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or, again it could be he's compromised by some blackmail/threat.  NSA, CIA, Russia, Israel, China you would think could ALL have blackmail on trump hypothetically and would probably use it.  Maybe add Comey and the FBI on that list after Thursday.  Should be interesting stuff.
      </p>
      <p>
       I want him to be remembered as the creepy,old,insecure,dumb, rich guy who stood up for all of us against tptb.  I think that would be epic.  And not because I like the guy, but because there is no one even SEEMINGLY trying to do the right thing in politics nowadays. 
 Atleast with trump I can pretend (for now) that he is trying to do the right thing and has a good heart- even if he is an idiot egomaniac who seemingly doesn't think before he speaks.
      </p>
      <p>
       But so far, I'm not convinced that that's what he is.  Working with Russia is nothing compared to working with SA and Israel, right?  Like even if you support Israel, aren't they kinda going overboard with the expansion?
       <br/>
       Anyway-end rant.  I'm going to continue to be a huge skeptic of trump, but I will stay hopeful(not faithful mind you) for him to do the right thing for a little bit longer.

       I like 2....but with a twist. What if he really was to show us how far American has fallen, and to reconstruct how we view our government? I would hope we can say "this is the last time we elect [this type of person]". It seems like as much bad as he is doing he is also doing us good to reform ourselves.

       I could see him saying this if there was ever a march on Washington.  He comes out to make a speech in front of a million angry citizens rioting outside the whitehouse.  "HEY!  You all are finally united. Very united.  It's Incredible. It took you all decades of being blatantly lied to and abused and manipulated before you did anything, but I knew I could help you all see it.  Your welcome America.  I made you great again".  The enraged crowed is now quite.  Stunned. You could here a pin drop on that concrete. 
Trump walks down the side of the stage in front of the stunned crowd and hops in the backseat of a UFO which had somehow descended unseen with Putin, pence, and the Obama brothers visibly inside. Before they peel away, Barack Obama yells out the sunroof "Bill Clinton is a rapist!  Bush knocked down the towers!"  Then in the distance you see Malik's hand doing the "OK" sign out the window and hear him crying "INFOWARS.COM"

       I agree, but I would argue that some ppl actually enjoy to be "shit on" and thrive off it.  Trump might just be like the MJ, Kobe or Kanye west of the elites who just has to do it his way. 
 That being said, I do think he believes he is standing up for the people-in and many ways he is.  But not in the ones that count IMO i.e. Bending the knee to Saudi, Israeli, maybe Russian foreign interests.
      </p>
      <p>
       But still, all ppl are different.  No doubt Trump has an ego-maybe that's a good thing for the pres to have maybe not- but some ppl also just live to prove others wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       If all trump wanted to do was chill or golf his life away he could have started doing that 40 years ago.  He's been loaded for a very long time.
Also, I feel like the 16 ppl he beat were prolly just as dumb (except rand)
And earning money doesn't make you an intelligent or wise person.  It just shows that he is willing to take risks and is determined not to fail- both virtues.  But Idiots get rich all the time man.

       This whole thing is so surreal to me. He went from beloved billionaire tv star to Hitler in the span of an afternoon. Obama fanned the flames of a race war with his support of BLM and now here comes Trump and the punch Nazis narrative dehumanizing his supporter who are a majority White.
      </p>
      <p>
       He is truthful that he did this to make America great again and the TPTB went along with it because they knew he'd sign anything they put in front of him? I don't fucking know.

       Trump is there, because he is supposed to be there. How much has he let people know? Think about it.. This goes beyond "good" or "bad". He is there for a reason, and people are Awakening... Buckle up buck-a-roo... This goes way beyond the Donald.

       So he made an ass out of himself, possibly cost himself millions and millions of dollars in the future, possibly break federal law, and he did this to prove others are bad ?

       Hahahahahhahahahahhaha

       He's not very smart in the political world and he got used and abused by the Republican party so they could push their stuff and build him up just to feed his ego.  That's all he wants, just the luxury of being called President.   Yet he probably never wanted it but just got off on running a campaign and seeing people kiss his feet all over our country.
      </p>
      <p>
       He's a schmuck who made some shady deals probably before he became political and then tried probably some real shady shit once he knew he's the man in charge.    But the funniest part of this story is that our hero was never in charge, those executive orders will all be null and void eventually, and he will realize soon that he ruined whatever legacy he built.   Could of been just a entertaining and charismatic rich guy who did good tv stuff and just cashed in on his celebrity before he retires from it all.     But he got greedy I bet. And thought he could go and pull the like dokie on career politicians and all those other Washington big timers.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's sad if it ends up being proven true that he did some shady shit, I did like the guy before he ran for office and I even gave him a chance after he won.    But the dude didn't do anything good that I heard he may do while campaigning.  He became a novelty act for the republicans and ultimately a loser.  Sad!

       Maybe he was discovered a long time ago that he is corrupt. Having him as president has caused a lot of confusion and possible would be change going forth. Getting him to be president seems unlikely, but it did happen. Could this cause reform, whether good or bad, in our favor or not, that we will then have to accept?

       I agree with those first two points but I imagine trump at somepoint maybe before or after the election-hell maybe even before he started running- someone in a black suit and shades approached him and said "if you really fuck up our stuff, we will JFK you.  You WILL play ball."
       <br/>
       Trump n pals are wealthy, or atleast have enough wealth generating assets, to make me believe he didn't do it TOTALLY for the money.  I think it's more like "I want all the oil from Russia so china can't have it". Like a resource cold-warfare move.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or, again it could be he's compromised by some blackmail/threat.  NSA, CIA, Russia, Israel, China you would think could ALL have blackmail on trump hypothetically and would probably use it.  Maybe add Comey and the FBI on that list after Thursday.  Should be interesting stuff.
      </p>
      <p>
       I want him to be remembered as the creepy,old,insecure,dumb, rich guy who stood up for all of us against tptb.  I think that would be epic.  And not because I like the guy, but because there is no one even SEEMINGLY trying to do the right thing in politics nowadays. 
 Atleast with trump I can pretend (for now) that he is trying to do the right thing and has a good heart- even if he is an idiot egomaniac who seemingly doesn't think before he speaks.
      </p>
      <p>
       But so far, I'm not convinced that that's what he is.  Working with Russia is nothing compared to working with SA and Israel, right?  Like even if you support Israel, aren't they kinda going overboard with the expansion?

       Anyway-end rant.  I'm going to continue to be a huge skeptic of trump, but I will stay hopeful(not faithful mind you) for him to do the right thing for a little bit longer.  That fuse is running to its end.  If he's ever draining the swamp like he said, then it's time see him make that effort.
