       Yup... I agree. It is gonna be whole lotta nothing... it's a non-classified setting so nothing exciting will happen. I think the most exciting thing to come out might be that this "Comey memo" the news seems to think is important doesn't actually exist.

       There's a chance of a revelation but the odds of that are small. I think the hype of his testimony by the news is part of keeping The Narrative going. CNN has been running a box on screen counting down the days, hours and minutes of it..

       Do you have a prediction on who the next director will be?

       No clue who the next director will be... if I had to make a guess it will be... let's say
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice_S._Fisher">
        Alice Fisher
       </a>
       just cause Gowdy seemed to hint it would be a female.
      </p>
      <p>
       I dunno why this testimony is a fuckin hyped by the media when no one gave a shit about the last one... I'd guess the line of reasoning is "Oh damn! Comey got fired and now he is gonna spill all the dirty secrets about Trump in retribution!" I dunno why they'd try to push so much traffic to C-SPAN, but it wouldn't surprise me if other channels cancelled everything on the board to broadcast it... just cause of how much hype there is.

       They've been running Trump/Russia story in a similar way Wikileaks did with Podesta's emails. Drip, drip everyday a new drip. Except with wikileaks we had actual content to go through and see for ourselves instead of anonymous sources. This hype is another drip drop in the shit bucket.

       I really don't know much about her... Not gonna bother digging too deep until someone is actually announced... all these anonymous sources are so incredibly idiotic that I just kinda tuned them out. I dunno how people can get so whipped into a frenzy by those articles like they do on
       <a href="/r/politics/">
        /r/politics/
       </a>
       but I'd assume most of them are so retarded that they don't read anything aside the headline then react on gut instinct and post "the feels" that the title gave them.

       If reality was even 1/100th as intense as

       this whole country would have burnt to the ground month ago.

       You know how it works... they totally ignore the stuff that is said that doesn't suit their narrative and then cherry pick the little bits to accentuate the agenda they are trying to push...
      </p>
      <p>
       People are forgetting that Comey has been out of the loop for a while now, so he's not gonna know anything now that he didn't know last time... and be even more unsure of what he is allowed in a non-classified setting.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's gonna be sad seeing him sitting there like Brennan and Clapper going "Dude! I was fired a while back! How would I know any of this shit? You are ruining my retirement."

       I saw some of Clapper's last testimony. He had the look like he couldn't give a damn and they were wasting his time.

       Half of them were reading loaded, politically charged questions off of a script to get it on record, already knowing there would be no answer. I'm expecting the same will happen again.

       It's not going to be anything we don't already know.  Mueller wouldn't allow that.  He's not going to say Obstruction of Justice because that would implicate him for not reporting it to the Attorney General.  Trump will have a meltdown on Twitter Live as the testimony goes on.  Tbh I think he's been very reserved (for him) regarding the testimony:  "I wish him luck."  It's these rare moments when he acts presidential and adult that I like him for a brief time.  I wish he'd stop putting on a show and acting crazy and just be a measures, calm and reserved adult all the time.  He'd get treated a lot better, too.

       He'll confirm some reports and we'll finally be able to weed out what is fake. Trump slandered and attacked him on T.V.

       I mean Trump of all people calling someone else a "showboat" or a "grandstander". Either Comey takes it or he doesn't. He's most likely a witness though so he may have to answer that some information is classified and bound by law to keep it secret.

       I think it won't be big, but it will prove the idea that Trump wants loyalty to him before loyalty to the Constitution. Comey will tell about how Trump asked him for loyalty and to drop the investigation, Comey said no, he got fired. I don't think the house Republicans will go for impeachment, the obstruction of justice thing will be waved off as "Trump trying to be proactive about uniting the country behind him, and rather informal because his life as a businessman means loyalty to the boss rather than the framework of the company". Democrats will seeth, and probably continue with their attempt to impeach Trump, possibly for the Emoluments Clause rather than the Russia angle. It won't go anywhere and we'll go back to the status quo of Republicans proposing a law, Democrats stalling it as revenge for the Obama years, Trump blaming everyone but himself for the failure of his agenda to pass.
