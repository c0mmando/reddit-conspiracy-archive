<p>Laborers contribute time to the economy. Capitalists contribute money. So in a fair capitalist system, it seems like time expenses should cancel out wages in the same way that monetary expenses cancel out gains. There is no net income if time = money. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes - when they are contributing their time to the economy, they get paid. Just as when a capitalist is contributing some money to the economy, they make gains. They don&#39;t generally get paid based on how much exertion they give during that hour - hard workers and lazy workers in the same job get paid the same (not including raises etc). </p>

<p>True. But its enonomics 101. They&#39;re both considered capital. One is investment capital, the other is human capital.</p>

<p>Human capital is not just about time. It also includes labor and skill, and compensation is usually based off of a combination of all 3.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t want to get off into the weeds with economics too much, so I will stick to your original point.</p>

<p>You are wise to see the discrepancy between investment taxation and labor taxation. Income taxes are not just. As you&#39;ve probably recognized, but didn&#39;t overtly state, income taxes are theft. There is a reason investment taxes are called <em>capital gains</em> taxes, they are taxing the gains on the capital invested. With income taxes, whether you want to call it a time tax, labor tax, skill tax, or a tax on all 3, the government is assuming you made some profit in the arrangement. Essentially they are dictating to you how much your time, labor, and skill are worth, and always taking the position that they are worth less than you are receiving.</p>

<p>It&#39;s theft. Only you can determine how much your time, labor, and skill are worth.</p>

<p>The real disgusting part of this conversation is when you consider the growing wealth gap in this country. It&#39;s very easy to blame the greedy 1%. Truth of the matter is, it&#39;s our system of taxation and investment regulations that are largely to blame, and that rests solely on government. Sure, greedy rich people probably lobbied for the rules as they are, but it was our government that decided to make and enforce them.</p>

<p>Consider this. Businesses get to write off all their losses and expenses from their revenue before they ever pay a dime in taxes. And this is law. We peons, on the other hand, are taxed before any losses or expenses are realized and most of those expenses cannot be written off in the same manner as businesses. That is the main reason for wealth disparity in this country.</p>

<p>Then you add this into the equation. There are many investment opportunities, such as IPOs, that we peons are not allowed to participate in because we do not have a net worth of more than $1 million. We can thank the SEC for that.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not the greedy 1% that are fucking us over, not directly anyway, it&#39;s our own government on behalf of the greedy 1%.</p>

<p>The sad thing is, no politician ever talks about these things. So if they ever talk about income equality and if addressing some of the things I&#39;ve mentioned aren&#39;t on their list, then they&#39;re full of shit and won&#39;t do anything meaningful to fix the problem.</p>

<p>The rich people say they create the jobs, so why tax them equally or more? But I say if the peons had more disposable income, they would spend more money, driving economic growth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s kind of my point as well. If we peons did not have to pay income taxes and had the same investment opportunites, regardless of net worth, we would have more of that disposable income and additional ways to grow wealth.</p>

<p>As it stands now, just about the only way to grow wealth in this country is to go to college and be someones employee. Our options are really limited in comparison to those that are already wealthy.</p>

<p>Many people are paying half their income towards housing now, too. The wealthy profiting off of other people&#39;s need for shelter is immoral.

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah there are lots of things that need to be addressed. I hope one day we have the opportunity to fix some of these things. Not to sound defeatist, but I think we&#39;ve reached a point where corporatism has all but eliminated capitalism in our country, and it&#39;s become ingrained in so many aspects of our legal structure that I don&#39;t know if we can reverse much of it without a complete overhaul of the system.

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah I could go along with that. It&#39;d be awesome if a bunch of people pooled their resources and bought a shit ton of land somewhere to just do their own thing. Perhaps some good societal models could come out of that and spread to other places.</p>

<p>As someone who owns multiple rental properties, I don&#39;t think I&#39;m immoral. I see it another way. I&#39;m providing a place for people to live, who are risky to have a business relationship with. I&#39;ve seen 1000s of applicants, and almost all of them have a shady financial history. They cannot get a mortgage, but not because of a lack of funds, but because of a lack of paying their bills. But on the other hand, I wish I didn&#39;t have to have rental properties to live a good lifestyle, so I kind of see your point. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yea - I don&#39;t mean to call anybody out. Housing is just the largest regular &#39;basic need&#39; expense we have.</p>

<p>If every rental unit went on the market - housing prices would drop to what, ~ 30% of what they are now? Prople will still want, e.g., landlords to help fix or coordinate fixing things that break, property managers to handle upkeep, etc, so it would open up new supporting markets that are not necessarily &#39;basic need&#39; based. </p>

<p>You extract more wealth out of taming feral animals than letting them run free then acting all surprised when they attack someone. You can&#39;t have rules without rulers. You&#39;re just dreaming the an cap fairytale </p>

<p>Sure you can, it&#39;s just a matter of how society wants to go about it. </p>

<p>Call it fairy tales all you want, but methinks you&#39;re believing in one and you sympathize with your capture. They call that Stockholm Syndrome, just so you know.</p>

<p>All of that is happening right now, <em>with government</em>. Seems pretty moot to me, yet you keep harping on it. I already told you, so I&#39;m not going to continue re-typing. Re-read what I said. </p>

<p>All taxes.</p>

<p>How does that work in a capitalist society? Is there a law that some percentage of profits must be invested in social endeavors (roads, etc)?</p>

<p>Taxes really has nothing to do with Capitalism (economics), per se. As for the society, it would all depend on which society people choose. There are Anarcho Capitalists, Voluntaryist (which is what I am), etc etc. I believe everything should be about voluntary transactions/interactions, Non-Aggression principle, and private property.

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with the overall idea you&#39;re promoting but your reasoning is at the very least overly complicated, imho. </p>

<p>Do it like this: Laborers trade time for money. If you&#39;re paid $20/hr, your time is worth $20/hr. That means wages are not income, and they shouldn&#39;t be taxed as income.</p>

<p>If you spend $100 to make $110, you have $10 of income.</p>

<p>If you spend $100 worth of time to make $100, you have $0 income. </p>

<p>True. But its enonomics 101. They&#39;re both considered capital. One is investment capital, the other is human capital.</p>

<p>Human capital is not just about time. It also includes labor and skill, and compensation is usually based off of a combination of all 3.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t want to get off into the weeds with economics too much, so I will stick to your original point.</p>

<p>You are wise to see the discrepancy between investment taxation and labor taxation. Income taxes are not just. As you&#39;ve probably recognized, but didn&#39;t overtly state, income taxes are theft. There is a reason investment taxes are called <em>capital gains</em> taxes, they are taxing the gains on the capital invested. With income taxes, whether you want to call it a time tax, labor tax, skill tax, or a tax on all 3, the government is assuming you made some profit in the arrangement. Essentially they are dictating to you how much your time, labor, and skill are worth, and always taking the position that they are worth less than you are receiving.</p>

<p>It&#39;s theft. Only you can determine how much your time, labor, and skill are worth.</p>

<p>The real disgusting part of this conversation is when you consider the growing wealth gap in this country. It&#39;s very easy to blame the greedy 1%. Truth of the matter is, it&#39;s our system of taxation and investment regulations that are largely to blame, and that rests solely on government. Sure, greedy rich people probably lobbied for the rules as they are, but it was our government that decided to make and enforce them.</p>

<p>Consider this. Businesses get to write off all their losses and expenses from their revenue before they ever pay a dime in taxes. And this is law. We peons, on the other hand, are taxed before any losses or expenses are realized and most of those expenses cannot be written off in the same manner as businesses. That is the main reason for wealth disparity in this country.</p>

<p>Then you add this into the equation. There are many investment opportunities, such as IPOs, that we peons are not allowed to participate in because we do not have a net worth of more than $1 million. We can thank the SEC for that.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not the greedy 1% that are fucking us over, not directly anyway, it&#39;s our own government on behalf of the greedy 1%.</p>

<p>The sad thing is, no politician ever talks about these things. So if they ever talk about income equality and if addressing some of the things I&#39;ve mentioned aren&#39;t on their list, then they&#39;re full of shit and won&#39;t do anything meaningful to fix the problem.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah I could go along with that. It&#39;d be awesome if a bunch of people pooled their resources and bought a shit ton of land somewhere to just do their own thing. Perhaps some good societal models could come out of that and spread to other places.</p>

<p>It&#39;d be an interesting social experiment to see what direction it takes.</p>
