       If anything the recent world events have showed me how the right and left divide has been corrupted and turned into identity politics gone crazy. How easily they can demonize you because you support either side. I also see both consumerism and socialism as obsolete at this point.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm sure I want to give Nationalism a try, basically the idea that national/ethnic identity is much more important than people think and that people should be taught since they are small to love their home and become the best they can be to help the nation grow, not because It's the "right" social standing to do or out of pretentiousness, but as an honest expression of that love.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you have any ideas? I think seeking the right balance between having a government that does a lot of things while remaining small is the key.

       Hitler compared the national identity to steel. That as long as it was kept intact, nothing would be able to penetrate it.

       Isn't nationalism a right wing ideology in of itself? Also nationalism is identity politics

       You quite literally are suggesting fascism with a 3rd way between socialism and consumerism, I'm not meaning this as an insult but I'm just pointing it out

       Yes, it is. This is precisely why people are so confused about "liberal" and "conservative" -- because -- if you look at the definitions, who would want to be considered "conservative"? So, you just confuse everyone until the "labels" become useless.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I have scholarly support for this.

       I think plenty of people want to define themselves as conservative.

       There is a tautology at work here.

      <p>
       Conservative means to conserve the power of elites, at its most basic level.
      </p>
      <p>
       With elite power, conservatives campaign to promote conservatism by redefining the term and also by just confusing people to the point of exhaustion.
      </p>
      <p>
       Years later, people believe the wrong definitions or believe the terms are too confusing -- because conservatives have the power to pull off the campaign.

       I can't imagine considering a wolf to be the enemy you need to be on alert against when you are more likely to be bitten by a swarm of ants, a disease carrying tic, or mosquito.

       I'm alert against everything... but some little tiny bugs aren't really gonna be a test of my mettle. I wanna wolf to choose to square off against me. If you are prepared to fight a wolf... then you are prepared to fight anything.

       Nationalism and ethnic Identity?
      </p>
      <p>
       Oh wait isn't that what the lefties promote, identity politics?   As for nationalism.  That is not what is being promoted, what is being promoted is alignment with Russia and they might be nationalists, but they have a global agenda.
      </p>
      <p>
       So you are going to have to provide something more for a description of what you think would work.

       As for left/right being the same?

       Remember there really is a difference in the two possibilities for governance and I don't care what name you pin on either side.
      </p>
      <p>
       Side one, all the power is from the top, no or extremely limited power to the great mass who are controlled with violence and religion or personality cults if religions are not allowed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Side two, the governed have significant power over how they are governed and those governments include strong individual rights.

       the shift needs to be the recognition that the divide is not left or right, but top and bottom. the millions of us vs the dozens of them. the shift also needs to be the recognition that democracy the only thing we have allegiance to.
      </p>
      <p>
       you have to define nationalism.  do you mean patriotism? what you suggest is in the vein of confucianism, but confucianism is inherently undemocratic and inequitable. it is also in the vein of orwellian statism, which is also inherently undemocratic and inequitable. lastly, it is a straight up call for indoctrination, which is a form of mental slavery. in a democratic republic the people shoukd always assume their govt is corrupt, immoral, and detestable. it is the only way to remain eternally vigilant.
      </p>
      <p>
       america is unique in all the world in that we do not have ethic idenity, we have civic identity. we are sneered at and condemned around the world for intolerance to others, but we do melting potism better than any place else in the world, we are also the least racist.
      </p>
      <p>
       people in america should go talk to french algerians or palestians or wegurs in china  (sp?) or the canadian inuit or anyone in sweden without a swedish last name--italian immigrants who went there 500 years ago are still considered oosvensk. they shoukd go to the netherlands around christmas and watch all of the 6ft tall blue eyed blonds parade around in black face and marvel at all the little black sambo, zwarte piet junk for sale.
      </p>
      <p>
       we have a shit load of problems and a long road to go, but we do ethic harmony better than anywhere in the world. i got over my euro-philia within 6 weeks of living ther. they are hypocritical, cognitively dissonant, hateful POS, and i'm white and according to 23 and me 100% northewestern european stock.
      </p>
      <p>
       appeals to ethnic and racial identity have been the primary tool used by the american oligarch's to divide us. most people don't even know that the real crack down on the black panthers came after they made an alliance with white appalachian coal miners. the oligarch's greatest fear is that americans will cease to align on amorphus, contradictory, shifting "ideologies" and align on economic and material universalism.
      </p>
      <p>
       i'm anti-staist so i can't agree about "the right balance of governement, " since i inherently oppose governments to begin with, but the iron law of oligarchies is ideology neutral, and should always be kept in mind when talking about govt.
