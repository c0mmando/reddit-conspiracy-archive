       So this is how it would have started. There would have been some kind of event. The politicians and media would have cried "we have to do something" then they would used the regulating authority of the FCC, that net neutrality massively shifted to them.
      </p>
      <p>
       First they would say we are only going to use this authority to target those planning terrorism...
      </p>
      <p>
       Then some kid would be online bullied with hate speech and commit suicide, or something. Then they would say we are going to use these authorities to stop hate speech. And the spread of extremist views like conservatism.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then like they had set up for a while already, Fake News!  remember them trying to make a big deal about fake new? Trump turned that around and used it against them, but this was a plan they had came up with directly to work with net neutrality. They would use it to go after all news sources they don't control.
      </p>
      <p>
       Every time I tried to convey this message to people I was always met with denial and or ridicule. They always said to me the government regulation of the internet is to protect us.
      </p>
      <p>
       I told you so. They always use fear and emotion to trick you into giving up your freedoms. They had an elaborate plan to incrementally roll out the internet's Ministry of Truth called Net Neutrality.
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT addition
      </p>
      <p>
       In case you don't know what Net Neutrality is. It stripped the authority of the FTC to protect internet consumers (so they couldn't impede the FCC), transfered that authority to the FCC, and reclassified the internet as a common carrier.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        A common carrier offers its services to the general public under license or authority provided by a regulatory body. The regulatory body has usually been granted "ministerial authority" by the legislation that created it. The regulatory body may
        <strong>
         create, interpret, and enforce its regulations
        </strong>
        upon the common carrier

       You demonstrably do not because everything that you've said in this post is wrong. Establishing ISPs as Title II carriers did not "shift massive regulating authority" to the FCC, and certainly not in a way where they could thereafter censor the web. The FCC still has the authority to make ISPs follow Title II but thanks to Doofenshmirtz and his band of idiots they're not going to. Do you know what this means? This means that the GIANT CORPORATE OLIGARCHS who control your access to the internet are free to censor, slow, and manipulate what you see and have access to.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Net neutrality is the principle that Internet service providers and governments regulating the Internet should treat all data on the Internet the same, not discriminating or charging differentially by user, content, website, platform, application, type of attached equipment, or mode of communication.[1] The term was coined by Columbia University media law professor Tim Wu in 2003, as an extension of the longstanding concept of a common carrier, which was used to describe the role of telephone systems.

       The idea of net neutrality was to prevent both corporations
       <em>
        and
       </em>
       government from discriminating. Without net neutrality, the US government can decide to discriminate against any user for any reason.

       Censoring terrorists is just one example, OP listed some others including internet bullying which has been a problem for a while. The extremely vague "unless for compelling reasons" is worrisome.
      </p>
      <p>
       The "compelling reason" is terrorism now, and of course it is because who would have a problem stopping terrorists? It's getting you comfortable with censorship by saying censorship is going to be used "for good". It's opening the door for more censorship in other avenues, for whatever reasons THEY find "compelling".
      </p>
      <p>
       What else is talked about in the news over and over again besides terrorism? "Fake news" and conspiracy theories are dangerous..what makes you think "fake news" isn't a "compelling reason" to discriminate?

       Yea and the NSA oy listens to the terrorists calls. Their laws would gradually effect everybody.  Soon enough some event would occur and scare everyone into allowing them to monitor us using whatever expanded regulatory powers they can get away with and then that would slowly turn into something else "for the kids" or whatever they want to push at the moment.

      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        On June 21, 2010, the Supreme Court held, by a 6-to-3 vote, that the statute's prohibitions on "expert advice," "training," "service," and "personnel" were not vague, and did not violate speech or associational rights as applied to plaintiffs' intended activities. Chief Justice Roberts wrote for the majority, reversing the Court of Appeals (which had ruled for plaintiffs) on the vagueness claims, and holding that while strict scrutiny apparently applied, even support in the form of intangibles like human rights training freed up resources for other illegal uses, and that combined with the government's interest in denying blacklisted groups legitimacy was sufficient to trump the First Amendment interests of the plaintiffs.

       You do realize with Obama's Net Neutrality powers in place Trump could use the FCC as a tool to censor the left wing media and democrat campaign websites. All he would have to do is come up with an excuse. Hate speech, fake news, the CNN employee with an ISIS inspired decapitation picture. Oh it would be so easy with this power expansion of the FCC. I think Trump should reinstate NN and use it just to show you statists what your own medicine would feel like. LOL

       Whoa whoa whoa. People seem to be confusing "access" to the internet with "censorship" on the internet. If the threat of censorship (that will be selectively enforced by the FCC) is the problem, why does Monopoly and limited choice to access the internet inevitably come up as the argument? If you don't like your choices of internet, blame your mayor, your city council, county commissioners, even governor in most states, that rigged the game in favor of $$$ to screw you, the people, out of choice. "But Comcast is eeeeevil!!!". Lobbyists only work if policy caves to their financial influence. So blame the leaders that took the bait, and blame the people that continually vote these morons in.

       To insinuate that the companies aren't at fault just because they merely propositioned the governors/mayors is asinine.

       Can you point to me where in net neutrality it gives the government the power to regulate what I can access on the internet? As far as I can tell it only gives the FCC the power to prevent internet providers(corporate oligarchs) from regulating the internet(and censor anything that they want for any reason, without the consumer even knowing).

       This is a false statement. The Obama admin. rammed through net neutrality in the very end of his term. Most of it didn't go into effect until Jan. 2017 and some of it hadn't even gone into effect before Trump rolled it back.

       Government regulating an information medium is not "one of your rights".  The internet has been a great open way of communications for decades. Allowing politicians and bureaucrats to get their grubby hands on it will not make it better.

       Classic left wing class division tactics. The rich are going to make money if you don't allow the State to run the internet. You are using emotional reaction of jelousy and contempt to trick people into giving up freedom. Just as the communist gets the poor to rise up using their hatred of the wealthy to then make everyone poor except for the communists political class.

       I agree with the other posters here, we need net neutrality left in place to help keep the internet censorship-free. Here's a link to an older post on the_donald, outlining some reasons why we need these protections left alone:

       Control over the internet is a big issue, which is why there is such a fight against net neutrality.  A lot of the government is in bed with corporate America, so of course there are going to be people fighting as hard as they can against net neutrality so it's easier and legal to censor stuff.

       Ah, reality. How often are people pushing things that can be thoroughly discredited at the most basic level. Then they wonder why some people don't even want to hear it. Ideologues will run us in circles forever.

      <p>
       Just as another example:
      </p>
      <p>
       Businesses don't pay higher taxes because of loopholes. The reality behind this nonsense is: big businesses wouldn't be pushing for lower taxes if they could get out of paying them all the time.

       And this is how Republicans convince their constituent to vote against their own self interest. Do you even understand what Net Neutrality is? Or do you just hate having this right because it's a right that John Oliver also happens to think is a valuable right?

       Yup. Net Neutrality is trying to fix a problem that doesn't exist. Up until 2015, we didn't even have Net Neutrality. Hey governments, LEAVE THE INTERNET ALONE!

       You do have some say so about who the "state." is if you bother with making an informed vote and aligning with others who also make an informed vote versus voting the way you are told to vote by the billionaires.
