        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>This is quite mindblowing, I was watching a presentation on Cern and the different sections that the woman would be talking about through out the presentation were: 1.Past building blocks of the future
2.Visitors from the future
3.streetview game
4.Timelines in space.
Would this not suggest that Cern is being used as a gateway?
To back that up when the next person comes on to do a presentation she shows a picture with what seems to be other object that look like a reflection but is apparently another world built in ours that we can not see. They took the picture on Christmas and she says you are moved cause you can see other worlds within the simple photograph, You can see things that are there from reflections in the grass and a lot of ghosts of heaven. Is she alluding to the tower of babel?  Do you think they are working on transhumanism and trying to bring other beings of the future and past into our world? Do you think they will be sinister entitys or do you think they will be peaceful?</p>

Each row/column adds up to 15, which in numerology is 6 (1+5), thus the 666. The Freemasons are ALL about Saturn, duality and eternally repeating time (Ouroboros). Drawing a line from 1-9 and rotating that shape slightly will give you the template for the <a href="http://www.freemasons-freemasonry.com/specul05.jpg">Freemason compass and square</a> plus the double X&#39;s.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is a pretty interesting story I came across a while ago that falls into this category. A couple of hours ago, I was in the midst of a coding frenzy when my stomach started rumbling constantly. I decided that my coding project can wait a few minutes and that I needed to go grab some food. I live in the western United States, so the nearest place is always a McDonalds. I just wanted some quick food. I wasn&#39;t dressed, I hadn&#39;t showered all day (days off whoo), so I wanted to run to the nearest drive-thru and get back. McDonalds it was then.
I picked myself up from the computer, threw a leash on my dog, and headed out. I loaded the dog in my car and turned the ignition. Outside, there was still a bit of light. The sun had just dipped behind mountains in the horizon and it was just dark enough to warrant headlights.
As I&#39;m winding my way out of my neighborhood, I started to notice that the streetlamps kept going out as I passed under them and then coming back on when I&#39;m passed them, which I thought was strange, but I chalked it up to coincidence as I&#39;ve had streetlights go out on me before.
I eventually made it to one of the last turns to get out of the neighborhood, but as I pulled up to the stop sign, I felt a wave of... something... pour over me. I heard my dog whimper. I looked back at her and she had ducked back into the middle of the back seat, tail between her legs, with her fur sticking straight out. It felt like I went through a thick sheet of static electricity, honestly, and I began hearing a loud feedback noise inside my head, and the world got blurry. This went on for a few seconds before it cleared up.
My car had stalled during this time, so I turned the engine back on and made my way past the stop sign. When I pulled out into the main road, I immediately noticed that the streets were vastly different. They were the usual black, but they had a bright white iridescent color to them as well, lighting up the environment. The streetlights that were usually on the medians on the road were gone as well, replaced by trees.
McDonalds was still right by my house. I could see the sign. It was in a different building, though. The building was much bigger than usual, but so far this is the least strange thing to happen on this drive. So I drove towards it, still very much confused as to the sudden change. My dog in the back of my car seemed to acclimate to this change much better, as she was back to sticking her head out of the window and sniffing the air.
I pulled up to the only stoplight between me and my destination and the car in front of me was something I had never seen before. The logo on the back was a silver circle with what looked like a silver Sicilian eagle in the middle. On the eagle&#39;s chest was the letter &quot;G&quot; in a cursive font. The model of the car was &quot;Vapor.&quot; The license plate was the same as any other, though.
So I go through the light, still wondering what the hell happened when I reach the McDonalds. I get to the drive-thru menu, which is all LCD screens updating to show featured menu items and looping gifs of people smiling while they eat. My usual is still on the menu, though for $2 more than I&#39;m used to paying for it, so I order that. I pull up to the window with my credit card out and at the ready so I can pay.
The worker opens the window and greets me. I greet him and hand him my card.
He looks at it and then back at me and says, &quot;we don&#39;t accept that here,&quot; and then hands me a gadget that reminded me of my dad&#39;s blood pressure monitor.
I guess I was supposed to put my finger in it, but I was so thrown off I just asked, &quot;uh, can I just pay with cash?&quot;
&quot;Cash? Sure, I guess.&quot;
So I hand him $20 and he inspects it for longer than anyone should, and then proceeds to give me my receipt without my change.
When I ask him about the change, he looked at me with a very confused face and said, &quot;we don&#39;t have cash at this location, sir. We only can give cash vouchers.&quot;
Oh..kay. So I look at my receipt and, lo and behold, the bottom of it says, &quot;cash value: $11.26.&quot; Good enough for me, I guess. I pull up to the next window.
After waiting for a few minutes, the next worker opens up his window with my bag of food in his hand and a big smile on his face.
He hands me the bag and I put the receipt in it out of habit.
He then says to me, &quot;Oh wait, I forgot your fries! Can I have the bag back, please?&quot;
So I hand him the bag and a few seconds later he returns and says, &quot;I hope you have a great day! I made this spe-sp-spespe-spe-mm-I-great day!-spe-spe...&quot;
This went on for a few seconds. His face and body motions were moving and resetting like when you tilt an n64 game slightly out of the console. I didn&#39;t have time to be terrified during the moment, because as this happened, I felt the wave of electricity come over me again. Just like last time I heard my dog whimper, and when I looked back she was crouched in the back, her fur extended. And just like last time, I heard a loud feedback noise in my head. My eyes took a second to adjust, but when the world came into focus, I saw that I was in a parking lot. I recognized everything. This was the parking lot in which the McDonald&#39;s I&#39;m used to is placed. And sure enough, the McDonald&#39;s was visible in my rear-view mirror at its usual location.
So I go through and buy food, again. My $20 was missing, as was my cash voucher or whatever, and drive back.
I have no clue what happened, honestly, and I wanted to get as much of the detail out as I could while it was fresh in my thoughts.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not watching a video</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, it&#39;s CERN researcher&#39;s own explanation of occult and alchemical influence on their particle physics. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The first article just says Einstein checked out a book.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Where do you think Einstein got his ideas from? He read books and formed new ideas based on them. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The laws of relativity are mathematically derived, it has ZERO to do with the occult.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why do you keep going on about mathematics? Do you think mathematics exist in a vacuum? Someone could accurately describe the nature of relativity in occult works, without explicitly outlining the equations. That doesn&#39;t mean it wasn&#39;t relativity just because it didn&#39;t have an equation. Saying that mass curves spacetime, or energy is related to mass, or the speed of light is constant are all semantic descriptions of mathematical equations, yet I didn&#39;t need any math to explain them. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Alchemy is also not the occult, Isaac Newton was alive before people even really knew what elements were. The whole point of it was that people thought they could make gold.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>.... Alchemy is nothing about making literal gold. That&#39;s a fairy tale to make it seem ridiculous. Alchemy is internal &quot;spiritual process&quot; to shape your mind in a way that you alter your consciousness/perception/processing of reality. You can&#39;t write off stuff that you don&#39;t even understand. Alchemy <strong>is</strong> the occult, it is esoteric knowledge about the inner workings of the mind. The elements are symbolic placeholders. Don&#39;t take everything so literally. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Yes very early science may have contained different religious ideas, they didn&#39;t understand it as we do today.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Arguably, they understood some aspects better and we have been getting increasingly more narrow-minded in our approaches to science. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>But saying theoretical physics is based on the occult is flat out wrong.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So why is CERN making a video explaining how the occult influenced them? Why are scientific principles like gravity, electromagnetics, radiation, and particle physics described in occult works before we were able to wrap them in mathematical wrapping? Just because it wasn&#39;t written in an equation doesn&#39;t mean it wasn&#39;t accurately described. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Take a science course today, all of these things are either mathematically derived or based on empirical evidence. Maybe you should understand the actual science behind what you are telling me instead of vice versa.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Go take a course in epistemology of science or scientific history and then you&#39;ll know where I&#39;m coming from. I&#39;ve done physics classes, I&#39;ve done calculus classes, I&#39;ve done linalg, I&#39;ve done astronomy, I&#39;ve done a number of these classes. You know what none of these classes teach? The history of science, the way these conclusions were arrived at, the epistemologies that define the meta-narratives that science runs based off.</p>

<p>If you don&#39;t know who someone like Kuhn or Quine is, then you don&#39;t really &quot;get&quot; the big picture of what science is. Further, if you don&#39;t realize what alchemy is (psychology), what the occult is based on (psychology, again), or the real big ideas about what the fabric of our reality is (holographic principle etc.) then you&#39;re missing out on a massive part of culture that has shaped more to do with our current reality that science itself has. Learn about &quot;macrocosm and microcosm&quot; and maybe you&#39;ll treat these ideas with proper respect, rather than the pseudoscience they are made out to be. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why do you think anyone decided to make those certain observations? How did they determine what experiments to run? What were their initial hypothesis based off of? What determined the background of each scientist? Their work doesn&#39;t exist in a vacuum, they didn&#39;t just wander into QM as empty slates, have an experiment plopped in front of them, and then dutifully transcribed the results to equations. It is hilarious for you to suggest that there was no influence on someone like Newton, who literally gave up science and worked in isolation after he devoted all of his time to alchemical studies. Sure, he had to make experiments and mathematical derivations that matched his ideas, but the <em>seed that sparked his inquest</em> was occult knowledge. </p>

<p>You&#39;re basically arguing that no scientist was influenced by anything ever, and that all science and mathematics exist as stand-alone creations that simply popped into being from nowhere. Do you understand how hilariously naiive that is? Just because you know what you learned in school about QM doesn&#39;t excuse the fact that you and I both know that you&#39;re internally conflicted about things like Carl Jung influencing the Exclusion principle. No, you didn&#39;t learn about it in school, not even in a PHD class, because nothing occult exists in school. Doesn&#39;t mean it isn&#39;t a fact. Your classes sucked, all my classes sucked, everyone&#39;s classes sucked, they teach you an extremely narrow-minded and naiive view of how the world arrived at the way it is right now. </p>

<p>Starting from the basics, you would have to be clinically insane to argue that Newton wasn&#39;t influenced by the occult. That&#39;s the founding rock that all of modern mathematics and physics is built upon (except maybe Euclid, <a href="http://www.freemasons-freemasonry.com/euclid_unveiled.html">who is a major occult figure too, not that you seem to be able to accept any of this</a>). The occult literally permeates our reality from a founding level. Our language is occult, our numbers are occult, our mathematics are occult. It is impossible to avoid, hence I find it so silly that you&#39;re basically becoming a goldfish arguing that you aren&#39;t surrounded by water. </p>

It is only very recently (post-WW2) that &quot;rationality&quot; started to rule supreme in science, so if you were someone in the 18th century, you would not have been able to even understand the field you were trying to study without delving into occult knowledge.

<p>tagging u/klondike1412</p>

<p>It&#39;s interesting that Newton apparently changed his initial views somewhat (compare 1675 to 1692).</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanical_explanations_of_gravitation#Streams">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanical_explanations_of_gravitation#Streams</a></p>

<p>In a 1675 letter to Henry Oldenburg, and later to Robert Boyle, Newton wrote the following: [Gravity is the result of] “a condensation causing a flow of ether with a corresponding thinning of the ether density associated with the increased velocity of flow.” He also asserted that such a process was consistent with all his other work and Kepler&#39;s Laws of Motion.[10] Newtons&#39; idea of a pressure drop associated with increased velocity of flow was mathematically formalised as Bernoulli&#39;s principle published in Daniel Bernoulli&#39;s book Hydrodynamica in 1738.</p>

<p>However, although he later proposed a second explanation (see section below), Newton&#39;s comments to that question remained ambiguous. In the third letter to Bentley in 1692 he wrote:[11]</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It is inconceivable that inanimate brute matter should, without the mediation of something else which is not material, operate upon and affect other matter, without mutual contact, as it must do if gravitation in the sense of Epicurus be essential and inherent in it. And this is one reason why I desired you would not ascribe &#39;innate gravity&#39; to me. That gravity should be innate, inherent, and essential to matter, so that one body may act upon another at a distance, through a vacuum, without the mediation of anything else, by and through which their action and force may be conveyed from one to another, is to me so great an absurdity, that I believe no man who has in philosophical matters a competent faculty of thinking can ever fall into it. Gravity must be caused by an agent acting constantly according to certain laws; but whether this agent be material or immaterial, I have left to the consideration of my readers.</p>

<p>Huh? This is a conspiracy site. There is a conspiracy theory that mankind has been enslaved by a sinister group trying to conceal knowledge and keep people unenlightened, downtrodden. This has been going on for millennia. Do you really think that science has not been part of it? That&#39;s why the case of Newton is interesting to look at.</p>

<p>Believing in god/devil paradigms but focusing only on the sets of symbolism promoted by the Christian church for the last 1500 years is stupid, in my opinion.  </p>

<p>Obviously, light/dark symbolism is universal and not all human cultures have anthropomorphized it or understood it in the same way.   Not all cultures see light as inherently good and dark as inherently bad.   It is childish to simplify the world this way,  in my opinion.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;The fifth angel sounded his trumpet, and I saw a star that had fallen from the sky to the earth. <strong>The star was given the key to the shaft of the Abyss.</strong> When he opened the Abyss, smoke rose from it like the smoke from a gigantic furnace. The sun and sky were darkened by the smoke from the Abyss. And out of the smoke locusts came down on the earth and were given power like that of scorpions of the earth. They were told not to harm the grass of the earth or any plant or tree, but only those people who did not have the seal of God on their foreheads. They were not allowed to kill them but only to torture them for five months. And the agony they suffered was like that of the sting of a scorpion when it strikes. During those days people will seek death but will not find it; they will long to die, but death will elude them.&quot;
Revelation 9:1‭-‬6 NIV</p>

<p>It will play a role in the coming 7 year tribulation when the demonic locust army of millions from the pit is literally unleashed on this world. Its no coincidence it looks like a &quot;stargate&quot; of old.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Saturn is Nimrod of Babylon, who built the Tower of Babel. Nimrod is a son of Ham, through Cush. The Egyptians called him Osiris, the Greeks called him Chronos, and the Hindu&#39;s called him Shani. The curse of Ham, I think is mixing with Annunaki, this is why all of the children of Ham are giants. Goliath of the Philistines was a giant, the Egyptians have paintings of giants, Chronos&#39; father Uranus was a Titan. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>yes, he is. See in Babylon Nimrod marries his own mother Samiramis and they have a son. I think he does this to concentrate the annunaki blood in his line. Anyhow it is said that Nimrod fathers the first pharaoh of Egypt, not Mizraim. In Egyptian myth, since Osiris is Nimrod, this means his son is Horus. Horus is believed to be the embodiment of Atum, the first god, who created himself from nothing, Horus, as well as the Pharaoh. Also Horus mother is Isis. Anyhow this is probably why everyone in Hollywood flashes the eye of Horus. Horus has a brother named Set, who kills Osiris, cuts him up into many pieces. Each piece is scattered. Just like how Nimrod was killed and scattered. Horus is most likely Zeus. Interesting note, is that Alexander the Great claimed to be son of Zeus-Amon. I believe that the line of Nimrod through Alexander is paternal haplogroup E-V13, which would make, if what I&#39;m saying here is true, Alexander not only son of Zeus, but Horus, Nimrod, etc. He most likely had a high level of Annunaki dna. Other dictator/emperors that also are of E-V13 are Hitler, Napoleon, Ramses 3, a Pope, Constantine, Lyndon B Johnson. Some of these guys may be technically variations of e1b1b1, but are all very closely related paternally. I always found it interesting how the Egyptians and Incans/Mayans extended their skulls. They all built pyramids too, which probably comes from Babylon as well.</p>

To me those are expected, and i understand the true source behind them and the powerful influence they wield on people.

<p>Just about everyday i get to the &quot;thats it, I&#39;m done talking&quot; point and never want to come to reddit or any online forum again. Then daily I&#39;m reminded that we are the last generation and that Revelation 12 is <a href="http://www.unsealed.org/p/the-sign.html">less than 4 months away</a> so i pick up my stylus and tap useless words into my phone in hopes of reaching even one soul....</p>

<p>Gotta finish the race, the end is right around the corner my friend.</p>

<p>&quot;For I am already being poured out like a drink offering, and the time for my departure is near. <strong>I have fought the good fight, I have finished the race, I have kept the faith.</strong> Now there is in store for me the crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous Judge, will award to me on that day—and not only to me, but also to all who have longed for his appearing.&quot;

<p>It&#39;s okay, I forgive you.<br/>
Acronyms are chosen.  They picked it.  That&#39;s why it&#39;s still called cern now even though the organisations name changed in the &#39;50s to OERN.  It was insisted that the cern name stay in place.  Why would that be?  It wasn&#39;t like it was well know then and had brand recognition.  </p>

<p>The organisation shares only 4 letters with the god you mentioned. As you can see in Wikipedia, it is not even known what the god is responsible for and if he is good or bad. CERN named after &quot;Conseil Européen pour la Recherche Nucléaire&quot;. 
If you look at the list of all weird gods out there, e.g. on wikipedia, you will see it is not that hard to share the same beginning, especially if it is only 4 letters.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The logo and layout was created purposefully to be three 6s intertwined.</p>

<p>It is okay to let your fantasy loose but you should stop stating stipulations like this as a fact in a discussing like this.
Look at the logo again and this page: <a href="https://www.quora.com/Why-does-CERN-have-666-as-its-logo">https://www.quora.com/Why-does-CERN-have-666-as-its-logo</a></p>

<p>Do you really think the blue lines must be 6&#39;s and not what the article is saying ?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>When the web was created there, they just &#39;happened&#39; to choose three Ws for the address system. W having a hebrew number value of 6.</p>

<p>Wrong assumption, please read this: <a href="http://www.av1611.org/666/www_666.html">http://www.av1611.org/666/www_666.html</a>. If you still disagree, let me know.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The entire site is built on a temple of appolyon. The very name given to the antichrist in the bible.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Please find me one semi-trustworthy source (i don&#39;t mean nutbags who just want to fool people on the internet to make money) that even confirms that this is true because I can&#39;t find any. FYI, its spelled Apollyon.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Statues of shiva the destroyer, robed rituals at night, really weird videos produced by the organisation (Symmetry) that have no scientific value at all. And on and on.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, they have no scientific value. You know why ? Because they are meant to have artistic value. It is clear that you can&#39;t see this value (i.e. what the artist is saying and why he is saying it) and that is ok, but you should not automatically assume that it fits your theory. There are tens of thousands of people from all over the world working at CERN and they are free to make any video they want. The ritual stuff that once popped up was a prank video to make fun of people like you. It worked.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Sorry, so far from what you listed here, your argument is very weak. You gave me absolutely no reason so far to think what you think. Those are not even real coincidences.</p>

<p>Please think about it, the only real thing that was in front of you that formed your opinion were 2 Youtube videos and a random website from some conspiracy theorists who want to make money with outrageous claims like that.</p>

<li><p>&#39;Angels are creatures. They exist, not by necessity, but by having existence given to them. That is, they have existence by participation. Now, what has existence by participation receives this existence from that which has existence by its own essence. Only God exists by his own essence. Therefore, angels have their existence from God; they are created.</p></li>
<li><p>God alone exists from eternity. He creates things by producing them from nothing. Creatures exist after they were nonexistent. Hence angels do not exist from eternity.</p></li>
<li><p>It seems most likely that angels and the bodily world were created at the same time, not angels first (as a kind of independent world of spirits) and the bodily world afterwards. Angels are part of the universe, and no part is perfect if it be entirely severed from the whole, the totality, to which it belongs.</p></li>
<li><p>The angels were created in heaven. And it is fitting that creatures of the most perfect nature should be created in the most noble place.&#39;</p></li>

<p>I do believe in other types of consciousness, such as animals, plants, and possibly non-physical or extra-dimensional forms of conciousness.</p>

<p>I do not believe in a creator god or primary entity that created all that is and that holds dominion over evrything.</p>

<p>I do not believe in an Abrahamic god but do believe that the entity that is talked about in the Hebrew scriptures like &#39;Yahweh&#39;, is actually a nature spirit or a non-physical entity/consciousness.</p>

<p>All of this is conjecture and I do not know anything for certain, except that I do not value the written word of the Hebrew Scriptures, the Christian scriptures,  or any religious text over any other.  They are all human creations and attempts to explain the world. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>He didn&#39;t. Angels are Spirits, created before men. They exist in the unseen realm and are not bound by the same laws that govern this mortal world of flesh.</p>

<p>Like us, angels were created with free will. The ability to either accept or reject the one true God is a choice they had to decide from. Even Lucifer (the devil, satan) in his original form was the most spectacular of angel of all. But pride filled his heart. He wanted to be worshipped and usurp the throne of God. So a mutiny began in the heavens, 33.33% of the angels followed the lies of Lucifer. The angelic war began, and rages to this day.</p>

<p>But it&#39;s <strong>almost over</strong> since the beginning of Revelation 12 begins this very September....</p>

<p>&quot;Then war broke out in heaven. Michael and his angels fought against the dragon, and the dragon and his angels fought back. But he was not strong enough, and they lost their place in heaven. The great dragon was hurled down—that ancient serpent called the devil, or Satan, who leads the whole world astray. He was hurled to the earth, and his angels with him.&quot;
Revelation 12:7‭-‬9</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Throughout Scripture the &quot;dragon&quot; is used to represent Satan. In the context of Revelation 12, I believe it to be a &#39;compound verse&#39; where there are multiple meanings it alludes to, all which are correct.</p>

<ol>
<li>represents Satan</li>
<li>represents the earthly luciferian one-world system that is emerging that will give power to the anti-christ</li>
<li>represents the nemesis/nibiru/planet x/wyrmwood/etc solar system that is approaching undoubtedly with 7 oribitals around it that is the physical/tangible means The Lord will use during the coming tribulation period of 7 years that causes the 21 judgements upon the earth listed in the Book of Revelation</li>
</ol>

<p>If you&#39;re interested in the more rawr, rawr, fire-breathing kind of dragon, those also existed in the pre-flood days as confirmed in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=job+41&amp;amp;version=ESV">Job 41</a></p>

<p>AKA - <strong>The Leviathan</strong>. A literal fire breathing scaled reptilian armored dragon that lived in the deep ocean.</p>

<p>Yes, the Bible confirms the existence of dragons and that God made them <em>(&quot;the more you know&quot;)</em></p>

    <div class="md"><p>How can you be so sure about the meaning of these creatures though? Like you can know angels are some beings that exists in some different form, that the leviathan was a crazy beast, but that the dragon is just a metaphor? Is it possible the Leviathan was just another metaphor for Satan?  </p>

<p>Are there other beasts similar to the Leviathan in the bible? </p>

<p>Do you think this creature (or others) still exist today? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Often the answer is &quot;it&#39;s both&quot;. Throughout scripture, there is a clear repetition of the use of certain words as a metaphor for Satan. Dragon, Serpent and Leviathan and others (Job 41 is <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/quicksearch/?quicksearch=leviathan&amp;amp;qs_version=ESV">not the only use of this word</a>) </p>

<p>It&#39;s very important to read Scripture in context. The context of the end of Job from Chapter 37 - 42 is a discourse directly from God to Job describing all different types of wonders that HE created. It helps to read all the ending chapters of this book to understand. The &quot;finale&quot; of this book ends with 2 epic creatures that are literal fleshly creatures that once existed and walked this earth along with men. <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Job+40&amp;amp;version=NIV">Job 40</a> describes The Behemoth. Which to me, reads as a near identical description of what we would call a <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=brachiosaurus&amp;amp;source=lnms&amp;amp;tbm=isch&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ved=0ahUKEwiClb6ypafUAhUJNiYKHWI0DmkQ_AUICigB&amp;amp;biw=1440&amp;amp;bih=770">Brachiosaurus</a></p>

<p>These two creatures are listed as great works of God, He created them. Think of a Dragon in terms of simply a dinosaur that once existed, but was killed off in the worldwide flood. The sea was full of many crazy giant creatures back in the day, it&#39;s where all the mythological stories different civilizations have had about giant sea creatures that attacked ships, etc, these are based off of a grain of truth.</p>

<p>Another interesting note is Job is considered the EARLIEST book in the Bible, before the time of Moses. Job was around in the period right after the flood, so he would have been familiar with the existence of these creatures at least through verbal stories passed down from generation to generation.</p>

<p>How do I know that in the context of Revelation 12 &quot;The Dragon&quot; is a metaphor and not a reference to the actual Leviathan fire-breathing dragon? Because it is explicitly stated, thus removing any doubts in Revelation 12:9 </p>

<p>&quot;The great dragon was hurled down—<strong>that ancient serpent called the devil, or Satan</strong>, who leads the whole world astray. He was hurled to the earth, and his angels with him.&quot; - Revelation 12:9</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not watching a video.  The first article just says Einstein checked out a book.  The laws of relativity are mathematically derived, it has ZERO to do with the occult.  Alchemy is also not the occult, Isaac Newton was alive before people even really knew what elements were.  The whole point of it was that people thought they could make gold.</p>

<p>Yes very early science may have contained different religious ideas, they didn&#39;t understand it as we do today.  But saying theoretical physics is based on the occult is flat out wrong.  Take a science course today, all of these things are either mathematically derived or based on empirical evidence. Maybe you should understand the actual science behind what you are telling me instead of vice versa.</p>
