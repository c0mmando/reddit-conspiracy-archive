       Also, OP's query is better asked "why are the luciferians ruling the world?". Which makes the answer easier to communicate: "because they understand the fundamental laws of nature and reality and know that we have never been alone."  Doesn't help that we listen to them and let them determine what thoughts are acceptable to think and share.

       If it is true (that they are Satanists), obviously they must believe doing all this stuff will give them power and wealth. That is the only reason I can think of that someone would become a Satanist.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or, it could be that they were born into a Satanist family and have been raised as a Satanist.
      </p>
      <p>
       From all I've read, the real Satanists are extremely secretive. They do not advertise that they are Satanists. They are upstanding citizens. They are even members of Churches (as their cover). They often look like the perfect family. Scary!

       People us "Satanist" very generically, and most often don't even understand what they're talking about.  You could make just as strong a case that they're serving "god", or whichever entity you please.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whether it's "satanism", extreme "god"ism, nihilism, or whatever, the common thread seems to be that they're into some form of occult practices, and they're evil, with no concern for their fellow man.  Unfortunately, so many people are brainwashed by the Church, that they call every other evil religious practice "satanism", without even considering that these people might just be serving the same entity that commanded his people to slaughter every man, woman, child, and animal in Canaan, back in the day.

       The people in canaan were against God.  They reveled in human sacrifice and cannibalism.  The ptb are the very descendant of those people.  There are canaanite horned altars in freemason 'temples' around the world.
      </p>

       There is also the belief that they were not human at all.  Rephaim corrupted bloodlines etc.

       Uh huh.  Suuure.  Make up whatever imagined facts you need to, to rationalize genocide.  See what "religion" makes people capable of?  You can dehumanized your enemies, make up bizarre claims about their behavior, say they're not "godly", then kill whoever you want, as long as "god" says it's ok.  I'm not a genocidal maniac, so I'll have nothing to do with that, thank you very much.

       It's not a matter of belief.  Just read the book of Joshua for a bloodthirsty tale of invasion, slaughter, and genocide.  And also notice, that there is not a single mention of any of the baseless accusations you made about Canaanites.  It was simply slaughter of men, women, children, and animals, because "god said to".  Freemasonry, the Vatican, and even the British monarchy have more relics of Egyptian and Jewish origin, than they do of obscure, destroyed Canaanite culture.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you find yourself on the side of people who need to rationalize genocide and murder of their neighbors, maybe you should take another look at this "god" you believe in.

       Jesus pretty much made The Old Testament irrelevant. That was the old covenant, he made the new covenant with man.

       No.  You call it irrelevant, because dealing with the problems in it are extremely inconvenient, to say the least.  Do you hold Genesis-Leviticus to the same level of irrelevance, or just the parts where god commands genocide, torture, human sacrifice, child slaughter, and stoning for a wide variety of petty offenses?
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if Christians want to be let off the hook for these crimes against humanity, what about Talmud and Torah thumping Jews?  They have no Jesus, for them to conveniently wave away the atrocities committed by their "god".
