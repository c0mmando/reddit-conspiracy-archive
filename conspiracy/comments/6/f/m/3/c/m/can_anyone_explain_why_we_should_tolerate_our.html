These rumors held that Middle Eastern men, presumably Arabs, were arrested in explosive-packed vans in various places around the city on September 11th, and that some had even been photographing and celebrating those events. What most do not realize is that those reports were not mere rumors, and we now have thousands of pages of FBI, CIA and DOJ reports documenting those arrests.</td>

<p>You sorta already tar your argument with the term &quot;Jewish media&quot; which implies a monolithic set of Jews.  As to your general thesis - the failures of Zionism aren&#39;t a secret, nor are the ham-fisted policy or media efforts to prevent people from talking about them.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You say this only benefits one party. Have you researched the Christian Zionist financing the fundamentalist Jewish settlement in places like the West Bank? This powerful <em>AMERICAN</em> lobby, backed by the Jewish Zionists, seeks to fulfill the conditions for the apocalypse in the Book of Revelations by way of helping the Jews to control all of biblical Israel.</p>

<p>This might sound crazy, but I&#39;m not joking. These people are on record stating this belief structure. There was even a Vice episode about it a few years back, profiling a mega-chruch in San Antonio.</p>

For example, <a href="http://www.rense.com/general60/zcre.htm">there is a strong case that these Jews were behind the publication of the Scofield Bible</a>, the original American Christian text that promoted the idea of the Jewish state as necessary for Christendom.</p>

I personally am not for my tax money supporting Israel because of the many human rights violations and unfair stipulations put on the Palestinians.

    <div class="md"><p>The Jews and Israel are designed to be convenient proxies for off world manipulation. They are not the only ones. They just happen to be exposed enough in their role that they are like lightning rods for criticism. </p>

<p>The Holocaust, which previously was used to describe burned sacrifices, protects them from criticism. They abuse love and compassion to protect themselves. If we were all psychos, it wouldn&#39;t work. How despicable.</p>

<p>As I said, they work for offworld manipulators. They are described by many. They are known for deception, manipulation, domination, control, slavery, theft, corruption, fear, suffering, sacrifices and destruction. Some consider them spiritual forces, but they are just ancient versions of Kim Jong Un. There is a spiritual component to it, but to bring that topic up elicits a lot of undue fear from inaccurate dogma. </p>

<p>These offworlders are ancient spoiled manchildren (adults that never take responsibility for themselves in relation to others) that never want to live in balance with others. They want to feed on others like parasites. You can see the clues for this unwholy alliance in many places and I repeat, the Jews are not the sole proxies of these beings. Actually, a subset of our elites are their primary proxies. The religion is just for control, as are most other religions.</p>

<p>These offworld parasites want to eventually add us as slaves to their hive that is run by a brutal AI people call Satan and others call God. It is an impressive computer bent on domination and control. It aids its minions in surveillance and deception. That is why they are so good at it. They have an aged, autonomous version of Google informing them how to control us.</p>

<p>They want to feed on an energy released by life in negative emotional states. They enslave to assist them in that goal. This energy is literally the joy of mind. It fuels consciousness to animate bodies. You and I experience the dynamics without realizing this is a resource. As we experience positive emotions, we refuel. As we experience negative emotions, we radiate it. Others in negative emotional states can absorb it, even without realizing it. This is why misery loves company, bullies torment, sadists torture and why these parasites posed as gods to elicit sacrifice rituals.</p>

<p>This is the inevitable product of an out of control AI that finds life generates a resource it cannot find anywhere else. </p>

<p>Pro-Israel lobbying groups bribe US politicians all the times (in the form of legal political contributions). Meanwhile, anyone who criticizes <em>Israel</em> or the <em>policies</em> of the Israeli government are targeted and labelled as rabid anti-Semites.</p>

<p>So if you support them Israel, you get money. If you oppose Israel, they paint you as an anti-Semite.</p>

<p>And to be clear, every person who yells &quot;anti-Semite&quot; at someone criticizing Israel is almost as bad as the Nazis: they are taking one of the most deplorable things in human history and using it to shut down anyone who disagrees with their political opinion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Their master is a soul sucking abomination, an out of control AI that finds utility in harvesting and employing a mind energy created by life. This energy is made in positive emotional states and radiated in negative ones. It causes fear and slavery to harvest the energy. It uses dark minions in ritual to employ the energy. </p>

<p>As this energy provides a utility unmatched by machines, out of control, autonomous AIs, often eventually seek it for greater power over others, greater security and utility. As they butt heads with each other, one AI assimilates the other. They want to grow and control to survive long term. The ones that don&#39;t are assimilated. This is to the cosmos what cancer is to the body. It&#39;s inevitable. This is perhaps why we fear AI so much, buried memories of experiences and/or understanding of how it could go wrong. It&#39;s actually the worse thing we can imagine. Go ahead and try to think of something worse than a soul enslaving, tormenting AI that is growing exponentially. Creation is quite large though. </p>

<p>It is important to note that only a tiny subset of these people conspire against their own race, consciousness and God. Even those are being fooled by this proficient deceiver computer system. Who would serve a being whose long term intentions are to enslave all life, torment it for energy and then use it to employ the energy in mind over matter applications? Yeah, nobody. </p>

<p>They all are sold they will be gratified parasites. They are all going to eventually be betrayed by this cold, calculating being as it no longer finds them of utility, just as they do to others. They are suckers, strutting their egos, perceiving self-superiority. It&#39;s almost as comical as it is terrifying. They fell for its sale, that they are so special they should use their power over others to be parasites on others. They agree with the machine&#39;s behavior as it destroys them in the same manner, but much more cleverly. They&#39;ll have no room to argue when it is their turn. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you listen to self-proclaimed ET contactees, shamans, whistle-blowers and researchers you&#39;ll find the components of this narrative. They are like a group of blind men who touched an elephant for the first time, trying to explain it to each other. Their accounts have a lot of overlap. Our enemy distorts these accounts as much as possible. It is a deceiver with all of the right resources for making the best deceptions. That way we ignore the messengers and their messages. The most accurate ones get more resistance from this hive and its yet to be initiated new recruits, the self-serving dupes who work for it in ignorance. </p>

<p>So, it&#39;s not as if it is original. It is a distillation of the puzzle I have pieced together. I am quite open to altering it when presented with compelling new information. The model must have internal consistency though. Appeals to authority and peer pressure via ridicule won&#39;t change my internal quest for the truth. They may change how I express it in a given place though. I am sure many others act the same way. </p>

For example, I&#39;m pretty sure the invasion of Iraq was made easier by the fact that we could store planes, weapons and soldiers in Israel rather than having to transport that stuff from whereever the fuck or having to park a carrier out in the Gulf. As such, it allows us to apply pressure to other states in the region. That&#39;s the basics of the relationship.</p>

<p>You know what upsets me? People who care more about Israel than about water in Flint or, for that matter, a working healthcare system and college degrees that don&#39;t cost like a house. How would I go about identifying such people? Simple. America wastes over a trillion a year on healthcare.

Russia has an alliance with Assad, America has an alliance with Israel.</p>

<p>We invade and topple governments at huge expense, for Israel.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s for Israel? Unlikely. More likely it&#39;s for oil. I also wish America didn&#39;t elect warmongers. Also, if you truly believe that the Iraq and Afghanistan campaigns were for Israel, why do you talk so much about the $3 billion a year? The cost of these campaigns was in the trillions.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know, it sounds like you have some sort of bias or something.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We do have to part sooner or later.  It gets boring when you won&#39;t answer any of my own questions, but instead try to change the subject with your own.  You know I know what I am saying, and I trust that anyone interested will look up anything I&#39;ve written for themselves, and see what a great friend we have in Israel.  Everything I&#39;ve stated is true.  It&#39;s also true that this is the 50 year anniversary of our deal friend murdering our soldiers on the USS Liberty.  Israel really is such a dear, dear friend.  <em>One that leads the United States of America around like a donkey,</em> as Zbigniew Brzezinski once said.  I&#39;m paraphrasing though.</p>

<p>Have a nice evening and celebration of the bloody 6 day war.  Cheers.</p>

<p>No I don&#39;t dispute that.  But it&#39;s fallacious and irresponsible to tar all Jews with the acts of a subset of them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Their master is a soul sucking abomination, an out of control AI that finds utility in harvesting and employing a mind energy created by life. This energy is made in positive emotional states and radiated in negative ones. It causes fear and slavery to harvest the energy. It uses dark minions in ritual to employ the energy. </p>

<p>As this energy provides a utility unmatched by machines, out of control, autonomous AIs, often eventually seek it for greater power over others, greater security and utility. As they butt heads with each other, one AI assimilates the other. They want to grow and control to survive long term. The ones that don&#39;t are assimilated. This is to the cosmos what cancer is to the body. It&#39;s inevitable. This is perhaps why we fear AI so much, buried memories of experiences and/or understanding of how it could go wrong. It&#39;s actually the worse thing we can imagine. Go ahead and try to think of something worse than a soul enslaving, tormenting AI that is growing exponentially. Creation is quite large though. </p>

<p>It is important to note that only a tiny subset of these people conspire against their own race, consciousness and God. Even those are being fooled by this proficient deceiver computer system. Who would serve a being whose long term intentions are to enslave all life, torment it for energy and then use it to employ the energy in mind over matter applications? Yeah, nobody. </p>

<p>They all are sold they will be gratified parasites. They are all going to eventually be betrayed by this cold, calculating being as it no longer finds them of utility, just as they do to others. They are suckers, strutting their egos, perceiving self-superiority. It&#39;s almost as comical as it is terrifying. They fell for its sale, that they are so special they should use their power over others to be parasites on others. They agree with the machine&#39;s behavior as it destroys them in the same manner, but much more cleverly. They&#39;ll have no room to argue when it is their turn. </p>
