<p>In that regard, perhaps <a href="/u/kn0thing">/u/kn0thing</a> would indulge us with a policy discuss as to why there has yet to be an announcement regarding net neutrality from the admins on either the blog or via <a href="/r/announcements">/r/announcements</a>. </p>

    <div class="md"><h2>Common carrier</h2>

<p>A common carrier in common law countries (corresponding to a public carrier in civil law systems, usually called simply a carrier) is a person or company that transports goods or people for any person or company and that is responsible for any possible loss of the goods during transport. A common carrier offers its services to the general public under license or authority provided by a regulatory body. The regulatory body has usually been granted &quot;ministerial authority&quot; by the legislation that created it. The regulatory body may create, interpret, and enforce its regulations upon the common carrier (subject to judicial review) with independence and finality, as long as it acts within the bounds of the enabling legislation.</p>

<p>Would you be open to title language that specifically mandates that the only thing the government may do is force ISP&#39;s to treat all traffic the same way?</p>

<p>Why do you dislike regulation so much? Would you have been in favor of Gramm-Leach-Bliley in 1999, even though it opened the door to investment banks betting against their own deposit holders via micro transactions no one knew about?</p>

<p>How is that instead of allowing the market to correct itself by forcing those companies into bankruptcy, they were given corporate welfare to survive?</p>
