        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Tipping is a bullshit way for employers to guilt trip customers into paying their employees. When you have people working a job, but relying on tips as opposed to the actual wage, you know somethings fucked up with the system. Tipping should be for good service/food, it should not be mandatory, in the sense that the waiter is relying on it to pay their bills.</p>

<p>To be clear I&#39;m not against tipping, I like tipping as it incentivizes good service. However, I am against employers who pay their staff the lowest possible wage just because they know customers will be tipping them. Tips should be a bonus for hardwork, not as a means to &#39;make up the difference&#39;.</p>

<p>Restaurants literally cant afford to operate if they paid servers full wages.  Its a way to double your staff. Your pay is directly linked to your capabilities and its a very solid system. Yes our bills rely on tips, but id rather have my shitty day be $10 an hour where most days are 25+ than be 12 an hour every day</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not a server myself but it&#39;s fucking disheartening to see people working a legit job and still struggle all because they are either underpaid or paid minimum wage. I would like to see a &#39;living wage&#39; where as opposed to a shitty minimum wage giving max profits to businesses, it would be a minimum wage where it could at least help you get by without reliance on an extra source of income. That type of minimum wage would fluctuate depending on inflation/cost of living etc. I&#39;m not into economics but I doubt minimum wage in a full-time low end job in most countries would be sufficient to get by.</p>

So many people try out serving and are shit so they think its always shit, but it helps servers out in the long run. Just because were able to go broke doesnt mean its the systems fault. its a self reliant job. you dont work for the manager or owner&#39;s paychecks you work for the opportunity to serve for them</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Restaurants do have high marginal costs, and the vast majority go out of business within 5 years.  Small business owners in particular are not bluffing when they say screwing with the market for labor will shut them down or lead to layoffs.  If you raise the cost of restaurant labor, these small businesses will send that labor home (underemployment) or switch to a model where the labor isn&#39;t needed (lost jobs to self-service, automation, ordering/paying at counter).  </p>

<p>Wages are too low in the US but that is because of the oversupply of unskilled labor and too much economic concentration in many industries that gives big business too much bargaining power over workers and consumers.  The restaurant business is not one of those industries.  If anything it is the highly competitive nature of these businesses that drives down wages and profits alike.  Tips allow the consumer to distribute their surplus (the difference between what they would be willing to pay and what they must pay) directly to the worker -- in many ways it is a more socialist system than you would have with the alternative higher wage higher price environment where the surplus goes to the owner (even if the worker did an amazing job worth more than his/her hourly rate) and cuts out the direct transfer of wealth from consumer to worker.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly the problem. Raising the prices is HARD to do to established business. you raise it even a couple dollars and you piss your regulars off. On top of that your servers are putting half effort in bc their bosses are making them clean toilets floors walls etc that are typically contracted in. Miserable front of house = unhappy guests add to the fact they now feel hustled for a few more dollars per meal</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why would it piss off your regulars if they no longer had to tip?  Total amount paid by the customer should end up the same if they were tipping before.  The owner should still have as much money to pay for cleaning staff.  The only people who would lose are people who weren&#39;t tipping.  There is no logical reason for tipping to exist.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;ve clearly never worked in service. I&#39;ve seen a regular swear off a bar because the item they usually ordered went up 1$. People suck. Bottom line.</p>

<p>The owner would raise prices 20%. Which is taxed. Then they have to pay the staff 12-15$/hr instead of 3$/. Do the math. It doesn&#39;t equal out to much more for the owner. Then the staff gets taxed on their shitty 12$/ hr job. Owner gains minimally - staff loses hard.</p>

<p>Part of the allure of serving is that there is an overall feeling that you work for the customer and not the employer. That would completely go out the window making the dining experience much worse for everyone except the owner who would work the wait staff to the bone to get the extra pay&#39;s worth out of them.</p>

<p>Not to mention the servers get absolutely screwed financially. U/BLACK-GUY mentioned a server making 50k a year. That&#39;s from working hard and building a loyal customer base that tip you well over 20% on a regular bases. Definitely not from 12$ and hour.</p>

<p>You take a away tipping you&#39;re taking away a legitimate income from people who use it to support themselves while they go to school or maybe pursue music/ painting or any other art form that this world just up and decided they didn&#39;t want to pay for.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t serve anymore but I did for a long time and it made my life a lot easier until I became successful enough in my career to move on. </p>

<p>TL;DR - If cutting tipping doesn&#39;t effect anyone but those not tipping then why are so many people who&#39;ve never worked in service complaining? </p>

<p>Oh wait....</p>

For ordinary low end service jobs I usually let them keep the change for example a taxi ride, but with some restaurants you feel like you &quot;should&quot; be tipping the waiters.</p>

<p>Tipping should be a bonus for staff for giving you a pleasant experience, not because you feel guilty that your going to look stingy if you don&#39;t or because that they&#39;re making a shit wage. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can&#39;t remember if it was in Fast Food Nation, but I remember reading a book my freshman year of college that blew my mind when I found out that the minimum wage for tipped workers was something like $2.13/hr and that their tips are supposed to make up the difference. It&#39;s absolutely ridiculous that this is even allowed. Tips should be a bonus for making the extra effort, not an expectation as a means of helping with an employee&#39;s base pay.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Tipping came to America from Europe. Originally in Europe, patrons of the service industry such as tavern customers would take advantage of the opportunity their wealth provided to proffer an unofficial &quot;bonus&quot; of sorts to the tavern maids and barmen in return for improved quality of service and special attention. Americans who traveled in Europe considered it &quot;worldly&quot; and &quot;cultured&quot; to show off their experience of Europe by engaging in this very European act.</p>

<p>There was a time when a major political movement developed to end the culture of tipping in America, given its district European roots, and it&#39;s clear relationship with the class system of Europe. Such a system was not inherent to the culture of America, as it was thought that the proposition that all men are created equal and afforded an equal chance of success precluded such recognition of the existence of classes. Legislation was even proposed to illegalize tipping, though it was highly unsuccessful.</p>

<p>Currently, as you rightly point out, not only does it continue to recognize the separation of classes culturally, but it also acts as a way of shielding businesses from the economic impact of actually paying their employees a fair wage, and instead passes on that requirement to the patrons, who end up paying far more than the worth of their meal, in most cases.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Restaurant pricing would be at least 25% higher if tip credit were removed, lots of restaurants would like to eliminate tipping but the ones that try fail. I mean small restaurants, not corporate, they have an entirely different model. The public won&#39;t support not tipping if it means $35 entrees and $15 burgers. Look at the price of a burger at BK or McD&#39;s well over $11 in many places, no tip involved.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly the problem. Raising the prices is HARD to do to established business. you raise it even a couple dollars and you piss your regulars off. On top of that your servers are putting half effort in bc their bosses are making them clean toilets floors walls etc that are typically contracted in. Miserable front of house = unhappy guests add to the fact they now feel hustled for a few more dollars per meal</p>
