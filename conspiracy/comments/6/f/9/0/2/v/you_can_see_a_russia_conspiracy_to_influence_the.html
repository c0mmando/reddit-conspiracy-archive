    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re just connecting silly dots. So what if he has art depicting children being sexualised, suffering and terrified. So what if he associates, and keeps in touch with, convicted child rapists. So what if he talks in strange lingo that is perfectly inline with paedophile language, as documented by the FBI handbook. So what if he is identified by name <em>and</em> pseudonym in a video of a child being tortured, and sounds exactly like the guy torturing the child. So what if people send him emails asking him if he wants to come watch a &quot;chicken&quot; be sacrificed to moloch, the god of child sacrifice. So what if he&#39;s into all of that spirit cooking weird shit. These are all just isolated points that don&#39;t connect.  </p>

If there was a Pizzagate investigation, it would dredge up the filth that infests every part of government, hollywood, business and law.

    <div class="md"><p>Yes.  Nothing there proves that any of that shit effected the outcome of the election.  Which is the claim.  The biggest impact if any which your link totally ignores is Comey announcing the week before the election that the email investigation was back open.  Did Russia talk to Trump admin prior?  Yes.  But barry O just called macron right before the French election as well.  Not only that there is no proof any info from Wikileaks came from the Russians &amp; even if it did... The content is real.  Maybe these people shouldnt meddle with elections elsewhere but they did.  Trump didnt spend his whole career trying to overthrow established governments.  Hillary spent a large portion of hers involved in that shit.  But at the end of the day there is no proof Russia did anything that actually influenced the election... I dont even care if they did as long as the content released was real.  Democrats did fuck with their own primaries though.  Donna Brazille did send Hillary debate questions in advance.  Bernie got railroaded which disenfranchised a large portion of their own base.  Did Russia &amp; Trump make them do that?  You link is absurd &amp; only proves Russia &amp; Trump talked but you can read the art of the deal to know that.  He didnt hide that shit.  He even said during a fucking debate that they should release more if in fact they were doing it.  It doesnt change the corruption that was exposed.  Do you think russians forced Hillary to violate state dept regulations &amp; put an email server in her basement then have <a href="/u/stonetear">/u/stonetear</a> ask reddit how to make that shit unrecoverable with bleachbit?  She is the dumbest fucking candidate that has ever run for office in the history of the country...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The US government has done worse things than that over the last 24 years &amp; the democrats pushed a candidate that was in the middle of all of it.  Trump didnt need Russian money to finance his campaign.  Sanctions being lifted?  They knew the relationship would continue being strained as it was with Obama/Bush if Hillary won.  We get along with Russia now... How is that bad?  Podesta owned Russian stock while working for the Obama admin.  The claim is weak.  Our government deserved a swift kick in the nutz &amp; it came from the voters.  Not the russians.  </p>

What is a hankercheif that seems to be pizza related?  Why did it seem to be pizza related?  If it was a hankercheif w/ pizza slices on it why was it hard to tell it was a pizza related hankercheif &amp; not one that seems to be pizza related?  What the fuck does that mean?

With the intelligence agencies there is no way to confirm if they are telling the truth.  Especially when they create programs like MKUltra.  They intentionally mislead the public.

    <div class="md"><p>Because i&#39;m not concerned that Russia will nuke us or that we will nuke them.  I&#39;m not afraid of North Korea doing that shit either.  Most dictators want to remain in power &amp; enjoy their lifestyle.  The only country that has ever used a nuke is my own country.  Russia is not a threat.  My own government is a threat to the rest of the world.  Trump is the first president that i have seen that has actually said we arent out there to police the world anymore.  He said it during his inaguration speech &amp; again mentioned it in Saudi Arabia a few weeks ago.  He is staying is syria currently trying to make sure ISIS agents are not able to leave the country.  He does intend to take oil when he goes... He said that as well.  Whether he is actually sincere is yet to be determined.  If he does some dumb shit i look forward to reading the wikileaks which is currently the only organization that scares politicians.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, the only country that has used a nuke in warfare is the US.  Other countries have used them, but only as tests(unless I&#39;m missing a juicy conspiracy).  Those first two nukes were basically a show of force of the weapon, and there is a very good reason why they don&#39;t get deployed in combat zones these days.</p>

<p>As for Trump, he&#39;s as sincere as his handlers and ego will allow.  He&#39;ll do what he&#39;s told because he knows it will make him more rich, along with all of his new friends that have/will latch on to him because he&#39;s easily manipulated.</p>

<p>Doesn&#39;t seem like it was very important to him? He left it somewhere and then didn&#39;t see a need to get it back. My presumption is that it&#39;s a novelty item - maybe a gift from someone aware of Podesta&#39;s interests in both NYC culture and food? - and nothing more. </p>

<p>That explanation seems way more reasonable than some of the other explanations I&#39;ve seen as to what a pizza map is. And why it would be printed on a handkerchief. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes.  Nothing there proves that any of that shit effected the outcome of the election.  Which is the claim.  The biggest impact if any which your link totally ignores is Comey announcing the week before the election that the email investigation was back open.  Did Russia talk to Trump admin prior?  Yes.  But barry O just called macron right before the French election as well.  Not only that there is no proof any info from Wikileaks came from the Russians &amp; even if it did... The content is real.  Maybe these people shouldnt meddle with elections elsewhere but they did.  Trump didnt spend his whole career trying to overthrow established governments.  Hillary spent a large portion of hers involved in that shit.  But at the end of the day there is no proof Russia did anything that actually influenced the election... I dont even care if they did as long as the content released was real.  Democrats did fuck with their own primaries though.  Donna Brazille did send Hillary debate questions in advance.  Bernie got railroaded which disenfranchised a large portion of their own base.  Did Russia &amp; Trump make them do that?  You link is absurd &amp; only proves Russia &amp; Trump talked but you can read the art of the deal to know that.  He didnt hide that shit.  He even said during a fucking debate that they should release more if in fact they were doing it.  It doesnt change the corruption that was exposed.  Do you think russians forced Hillary to violate state dept regulations &amp; put an email server in her basement then have <a href="/u/stonetear">/u/stonetear</a> ask reddit how to make that shit unrecoverable with bleachbit?  She is the dumbest fucking candidate that has ever run for office in the history of the country...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And you only know that because Putin supported Trump and had his hackers release DNC&#39;s emails. If Putin supported Hilary, we&#39;d know what questions Trump was fed by his News correspondents. </p>

<p>And honestly, that&#39;s <a href="http://observer.com/2017/06/trump-tucker-carlson-daily-caller/">no bigger than this scandal.</a> Trump was basically paying for press coverage.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Tucker failed to disclose his financial benefit from Trump’s campaign to FOX News viewers even as he commented on the presidential election, interviewed Trump and accused other news outlets of bias,&quot; CMD executive director Lisa Graves said in a statement.</p>
