<p>It felt like we were veering towards a society without religion being overly important during 2000 - 2010. Christianity didn&#39;t feel as dominant or smothering as it used to be. Now I see people like Piers Morgan having a breakdown over someone questioning a religion. As well as just a lot of people in general.</p>

<p>It felt like Christianity was fair game to insult over the last 10 years, now we can&#39;t say a word about religion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Political Correctness is to me one of those slippery slope issues, I agree with Jordan Peterson when he criticizes that 77 different genders is stupid is stupid or when black folk have to fix our shit rather then rely on others to fix our shit for us. Saying critical things to people you care about isn&#39;t mean, it fosters growth. The slope falls away when people bring generalities to the mix as justification as to why something is better or worse.</p>

<p>Shit like, &quot;Muslims and Islam are terrible things and must be cleansed of the world&quot; are just as asinine and stupid as&quot;white men and Christianity are civilization killers and must be destroyed&quot; .Or &quot; Jews own major central banks and media empires and are pure evil&quot; and &quot;I was watching World Star, black people are simple savages&quot;. Things like this are where saying something without really diving into why and what brought these things to be said are troublesome and do nothing, but destroy any meaningful conversation on how to stop incidents and touchy issues that can be used to frame a narrative.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think white men are ALL evil, it was thanks to some white men that African Americans were freed people and women could vote, I don&#39;t think Muslims and Islam are evil just because a few assholes and murders do fucked up shit, people do fucked up shit, that doesn&#39;t mean humanity is fucked up. I don&#39;t think all Jews are inhuman greedy bastards that want to dominate me nor as a Afro American think I&#39;m a simple minded beast of being. </p>

<p>Generalities are what destroy political correctness when critiques of things need to looked at for growth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It must of been nice for us though, growing up at the cusp of social media before the world realized we could lose our entire careers by saying one dumb thing.</p>

<p>Our lives were probably the easiest it will ever be, now every child will have to work on his social media image and avoid rattling the thought police online. Hell, people have to use social media to get careers (LinkedIn)</p>

<p>It isn&#39;t about respect, every culture makes fun of each other in some way. Hell I saw a video about a Greek guy bitching how Chinese people can&#39;t make Greek food and shouldn&#39;t have that kind of business. That was on the top of Reddit the other day. Cultural differences are awe inspiring sometimes and funny at others and there is nothing inherently wrong with that.</p>

<p>They tend to be hand in hand for me, political correctness comes from zero tolerance policies that were put in place from fear of retaliation for making a mistake. Political correctness demands, a slave obeys. What really suffers is education, through the kid who was raised in squalor by racist parents. He wants to speak up, but he knows his white trash place and he is worried that his inherent dumbness will cause him to flounder searching for the right words to say. I&#39;ve seen way too many fucked up kids end up worse off after their short jaunts with schools because they are taught by their parents to stand up to people who bully them and end up expelled.</p>

<p>Intellect actually thrives when you allow it to, instead of focusing on what words are allowed to said or deciding that if a kid gets his ass beat he should have to suffer the same punishment as the beater. It promotes equal suffering for upsetting the status quo. </p>

<p>Systemic oppression is more of what I consider it, since the money focused into schools that toe that line.</p>

Part of that, of course, is brain elasticity.  I still feel as if my cognition has been hindered beyond what would be considered normal, and I am not sure about the cause.  It is something I think about a lot though, as a large part of my life involves competitive gaming.  </p>

<p>Not to be a dick, but that might have something to do with it.  There&#39;s nothing wrong with playing video games, but having a large part of you life revolve around clicking buttons on a screen is probably not helpful to living a good life.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are multiple studies. That book just lays out the concept of dysgenics very succinctly. As for controversy I&#39;d point out very little of the criticism of Lynn has to do with the data and more fears that he&#39;s racist. </p>

<p>This is a symptom of a greater problem, people who think 20 years old is antediluvian.  For what it&#39;s worth, I took three semesters of calculus, and every single thing I learned was known in the 1700s or possibly early 1800s.  And you think the fact that something is 20 years old discredits it.  What a joke.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The United States performs a census every decade. The census reports the amount of hours of TV watching, radio listening, social media, gaming, etc. I was shocked how much time people have for entertainment. If they were working over time, they would not be excessively entertaining themselves. What percentage of workers work over time?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s many unemployed or partially-employed people who can&#39;t get more hours. Seems everyone in the US works 0 hours a week, 24 hours a week, or 70-90 hours a week. There&#39;s no in-between. So I think the entertainment people are often different from the working people. </p>

<p>Plus a lot of people watch TV or surf the net in the background while they do other things, so the multitasking because of easily accessible technology may be skewing those numbers</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe with some parents. But there&#39;s plenty of &quot;Tiger mom&quot; parents around too. </p>

<p>I feel like there&#39;s a lot of talk about making sure they&#39;re told they&#39;re wonderful and special, but in reality it&#39;s just a PR move of sorts to cover for how poorly they&#39;re treating the kids (or just outright ignoring them). It&#39;s like how corporations have teambuilding exercises to boost team morale, but they&#39;re still working those people as hard as they can. The self-esteem boost is just so they can squeeze more work out of them, it&#39;s a calculated move and is not genuine, which is why few people gain actual self esteem from these calculated presentations. My 2 cents</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe it&#39;s not the phones themselves but the way we are taught to learn. There is incredible stimulation with these devices and information can be found on anything from a click at the button. They ARE talking but to people all over the world. It is not ideal it&#39;s just were in the middle of a transitional society of hyper connectivity. I understand what you mean and there are a lot of problems arising but there are also solutions arising to many things as well. Personally, i think either well reach a next stage of evolution, or this was never meant to be and civilization will crumble under its own discoverys. I&#39;m not sure which but I&#39;d assume its the earlier, and hopefully not the latter. </p>

<p>If so, the whole &quot;students won&#39;t get off their phones&quot; I feel like isn&#39;t technologies fault all together, but also the modern school system. I&#39;m 18 (went to school up until I homeschooled myself my senior year), and I can tell you right now it&#39;s not that kids are addicted to phones, it&#39;s that the school system sucks so much that they use phones as a sort of outlet. Once school is out however, the phones go away, trust me. During lunch or after school I barely saw anyone on their phones unless they were just by themselves.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Re-read The Lost World a little while ago and this part jumped out at me, this was 1995 btw</p>

<p>&quot;... Although personally, I think cyberspace means the end of our species.&quot;</p>

<p>Why is that?</p>

<p>Because it means the end of innovation. This idea that the whole world is wired together is mass death. Every biologist knows that small groups in isolation evolve fastest. You put a thousand birds on an ocean island and they&#39;ll evolve very fast. You put ten thousand on a big continent, and their evolution slows down. Now, for our own species, evolution occurs mostly through out behavior. We innovate new behavior to adapt. And everybody on earth knows that innovation only occurs in small groups. Put three people on a committee and they may get something done. Ten people, and it gets harder. Thirty people, and nothing happens. Thirty million, it becomes impossible. That&#39;s the effect of mass media-it keeps anything from happening. Mass media swamps diversity. It makes every place the same. Bangkok or Tokyo or London: there&#39;s a McDonalds on one corner, a Benetton on another, a Gap across the street. Regional differences vanish. All differences vanish. In a mass-media world, there&#39;s less of everything except the top ten books, records, movies, ideas. People worry about losing species diversity in the rain forest. But what about intellectual diversity-our most necessary resource? That&#39;s disappearing faster than trees. But we haven&#39;t figured that out, so now we&#39;re planning to put five billion people together in cyberspace. And it&#39;ll freeze the entire species. Everything will stop dead in it&#39;s tracks. Everyone will think the same thing at the same time. Global uniformity.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have a theory that intelligence is directly proportional to dopamine production/receptivity.</p>

<p>Dopamine is related to, and may be produced by, satisfying goals, receiving rewards, feeling loved, loving yourself, receiving love.  These actions and experience can lead to effects which will make your brain work better.</p>

<p>The opposite:  depression, feeling hated, missing goals, receiving punishment, hating yourself; all can lead to &quot;dopamine deficiency&quot;.  Dopamine deficiency leads to over all inaction &amp; lack of motivation.  Which can make a person seem different/muted, and thus &quot;dumber&quot;.</p>

<p>Further theory is: dopamine deficiency can make a person lash out or have anxiety because the sufferer can only summon dopamine to act through the flight or fight response, as a last resort.  Any other time the sufferer has normal thoughts in their head but can not find the motivation to speak or act, eventually leading to the feeling of being locked in.</p>

<p>Also I believe fibromyalgia is extreme dopamine deficiency.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Gotta wonder what good ol&#39; DARPA is up to w/ those accusations of mind &amp; weather control. Dabbling with quantum mechanics using particle accelerators, potentially perverting people&#39;s minds into that of a mindless hive mentality; stupified &amp; complacent. Then there&#39;s the theory that we live in a simulation, what would that make us? Batteries? Processors? Does our own creativity could me from a place that benefits those who control our sim? Are we NPCs waiting to achieve free will? Is everything in the world from climate to politics to tech to media, reflect a more grandiose meaning to the long expected singularity?</p>

<p>Has the singularity already passed? Are science &amp; religion two haves of the same coin that need to be looked upon at the same time? Back to your topic, mental disorders, maybe one in particular acts like a means to disrupt DARPAs mind control. When you split a mind into binary, bred from madness &amp; lunacy of environment &amp; thusly self. </p>

<p>What happens when we run out of ideas for media? When things become unoriginal. And there&#39;s nothing left to enjoy even with infinite time? What lies behind our minds eye? A wormhole? One that transcends time &amp; provides foresight from a future yet untold? Sounds crazy, but maybe this simulation we live in, Uni, is a pattern that repeats itself, like a fractal for a reason. Every crack your concious by perceiving that the reason why some models of the known universe look almost neurological in function is because we actually exist within a supremely intelligent being. God. Genderless, the original diode, node, note, tune, beat, rhythm, rhyme, bass, treble, light &amp; audio?</p>

<p>The universe is a much more amazing place than ever imagined. Imagine. Now that&#39;s an interesting word. The body, the brain, the mind, the soul, the sub concious, sub focus, the spirit. When you dream where does it come from? When you create art, is it your own or designed by a system beyond your free will&#39;s extension? </p>

<p>I&#39;m getting off track, probably didn&#39;t touch on much, but a lot has been gone on in recent months. Hopefully someone parsed the concepts while the &quot;Omega Storms&quot; hit &amp; the &quot;Alpha Ego&quot; tries to claim the throne. </p>

<p>As above, so below. As around, so within. I am the echo the spark, before the big bang. An ark, a tool, the one that first sang... who am I?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is by design. We&#39;ve offloaded much of our cognitive functions (memory, recall, information synthesis) to our always-on soft-cyborg interface (the thing I&#39;m typing this comment on). So, ironically, everyone <em>believes</em> themselves to be &quot;smarter&quot; than they actually are - remember that back in the day much of &quot;schooling&quot; was memorization of facts, dates, and a common narrative, which was then amplified and reenforced by mass media and social custom. </p>

<p>But the reality now (as anyone who is &quot;aware&quot; realizes) is that we as individuals &quot;know&quot; <em>far less</em> than we used to - when all you had to manage was the knowledge in yr own head along w a human-scale information flow, it was easier to metabolize and synthesize the info-stream into a coherent worldview. So, <em>real</em> wisdom and understanding was built into - and encouraged by - the system. Not anymore. </p>

<p>So where are we now? We&#39;ve atomized the social order (via destruction of The American Mythos) and splintered everyone according to rampant categorization and data-driven social verticals. And the info flow is <em>completely overwhelming</em>. It&#39;s not really even about becoming &quot;more stupid-er&quot;; rather, it is about feeling adrift in a sea of information, and not having appropriate tools to navigate the waters. The truly incapable are often the loudest, and because our soft-cyborg interfaces are designed to be lowest common denominator the Lousy Navigators seem to be leading the fleet. </p>

<p>Bottom line: learn to use the interfaces and navigate yr own voyage. What we&#39;re living through is an emergent mutiny. To this I say: fuck yes!</p>

<p>Indeed, there is. It is interesting how the masses have been tricked into participating in counterproductive behavior via social pressure. I&#39;m convinced that tattoos were popularized in order to make the lower classes instantly identifiable. And rap music was designed to promote racial division. </p>

<p>Now however we live a life of convenience and routine. Also we have no natural predators and the enviroment is also no longer a threat to most of us &quot;civilised&quot; people. </p>

<p>So we have no reason to maintain or advance as a species, except for a curve in our backs maybe and eyes that protect themselves from LED screens lol.</p>
