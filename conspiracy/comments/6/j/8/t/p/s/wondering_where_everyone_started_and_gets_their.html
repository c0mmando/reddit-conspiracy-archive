I&#39;ve followed this page for a bit and it seems like everyone knows the same info and some stories though they may disagree with the different parts of it all. I want to know all the things and form my own ideas too. I&#39;m in my 30s and I feel like I&#39;m great at searching the internet but I just don&#39;t know where to begin.  It feels like I left a room full of &quot;believe everything you hear zombies&quot; but I&#39;m an outsider in another room just over hearing conversations I can only follow and understand a little.  Where does everyone get their info when it&#39;s hard to know who to trust. Where should I start? 9/11 coverup? Clintons? Bush? Russia? Media? New World Order? The Elite? Big Pharmacy? It&#39;s seems overwhelming to me but I don&#39;t want to miss anything, I don&#39;t want to give up, and I want to know this stuff. I want to be about to engage and have a solid fact based opinion. Thanks for any help. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Everyone&#39;s path is different, what worked for me may not work for you. </p>

<p>The whole conspiracy landscape covers literally everything and anything that has gone on, that is going on, that will go on.<br/>
I feel it&#39;s impossible for any one person to grasp the entirety so only focus on the areas that are interesting to me.  </p>

<p>I would recommend taking a quick look at any conspiracy subject and see what one&#39;s interest you, from there you&#39;re likely going to want to watch as many documentaries about that subject as possible. Because now you want answers, your main direction should always be research, then research some more, then more.</p>

<p>How deep you go into each sub-conspiracy is your choice, in my opinion however I learnt early on that everything is connected.</p>

<p>What I personally choose to do, is when I am researching and gaining new information or opinion, I will often get to a point where it&#39;s referencing something I&#39;m not aware of or understand well enough.
I make a note and a bookmark of what that is and make that the next thing I look into. </p>

<p>Good luck</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It really just took an entire lifetime growing up in the south poor for me. My father told me about these lights in the sky in his town and how the neighborhood kids would get in their trucks and run to follow them around. They even wrote about the event in the local newspapers because noone could explain the lights.</p>

<p>Fast forward to now, working closely with law enforcement and seeing how corruption is systemic. There are good people everywhere, but all it takes is a small group with desires to fuck it all up. Then I started looking towards the justice system, health system, and our military and one thing sticks out like a sore thumb. Every policy isn&#39;t written for the citizen, it&#39;s for the ones who will profit from it.</p>

<p>They don&#39;t mind our squalor or suffering, we are necessary for the money machine. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks that&#39;s a great plan to start with. I appreciate how you stated where to start and how it would lead. Thanks also for your work with law enforcement. I can see the corruption but I can only imagine what it&#39;s like from the inside.

    <div class="md"><p>Oh, I&#39;ve never been full law enforcement, I work in a position close to them and interact with them often with investigations. I don&#39;t really like saying what it is exactly I do, since some users enjoy deep diving to figure out who is who.</p>

<p>It only really takes two people to create a conspiracy if you honestly get down to it. Collaboration and action.</p>

<p>Anyone can research the inner workings of these places though, many authors have tackled police corruption and how they work. David Simon does a great job at this (He created The Wire, and was a journalist in one of the most dangerous cities in America). I&#39;m actually currently reading Homicide by him. I&#39;m going to check out The Corner  by him next time which follows the kids who are raised into the drug trade.</p>

<p>When you strip away the money and the politics in the system, it helps to cut through and see the humanity on both sides suffering day in and day out caught between the teeth of the system. </p>

<p>Read everything, and be critical of everything. Welcome to the never-ending rabbit hole lol.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When I was pretty young, maybe 11 or 12, I watched a documentary on Fox which detailed the moon landing conspiracy theory. I think that really flipped a switch in my brain and sent me down this path of skepticism. I remember asking my dad about it and he reacted with venom. I never understood that until I got a bit older.</p>

<p>I was pretty young and naive at that age (as most are), so it was natural to just assume that the government didn&#39;t lie to us. Now I am on the complete opposite side of the spectrum.</p>

<p>Now pick a subject you are interested in.  Let us say its Pharmaceutical Industry.  Find a classic pro industry piece and read it, and then search for a critique.   Identify their arguments, and use your judgment on what is right and what is not.  But do it with the background awareness of the principles outlined in the works recommended.   Be conscious of whether the judgment you are making is because of techniques described above, or is it because the arguments are valid and sound.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I recommend starting at the very beginning with the mystery Babylon series done by Bill Cooper. I made a post recently with transcripts of it, or you can listen to them on YouTube. It&#39;s alot to take in, but very worth it if you are wanting to become a conspiracy theorist. </p>

<p>Also, check out the high level insider AMA&#39;S:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I became &quot;woke&quot;  during my 6 year stint in the military.  The more you get out into the world,  see the military industrial machine in action,  and see how  people are only pawns in a game to make someone else rich,  it opens your eyes as to why things are the way they are,  and you begin to question everything,  Which is my advice,  question everything.  Take nothing at face value and assume everything you see is propaganda,  a straight lie,  or some form of an attempt to deceive or brainwash you,  and that includes what you see in this sub!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh, I&#39;ve never been full law enforcement, I work in a position close to them and interact with them often with investigations. I don&#39;t really like saying what it is exactly I do, since some users enjoy deep diving to figure out who is who.</p>

<p>It only really takes two people to create a conspiracy if you honestly get down to it. Collaboration and action.</p>

<p>Anyone can research the inner workings of these places though, many authors have tackled police corruption and how they work. David Simon does a great job at this (He created The Wire, and was a journalist in one of the most dangerous cities in America). I&#39;m actually currently reading Homicide by him. I&#39;m going to check out The Corner  by him next time which follows the kids who are raised into the drug trade.</p>

<p>When you strip away the money and the politics in the system, it helps to cut through and see the humanity on both sides suffering day in and day out caught between the teeth of the system. </p>

<p>Read everything, and be critical of everything. Welcome to the never-ending rabbit hole lol.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yea thanks that&#39;s deep stuff. I can see how important that will be. I guess knowing the truth about things and waking up to what is really going on can be pretty overwhelming. </p>
