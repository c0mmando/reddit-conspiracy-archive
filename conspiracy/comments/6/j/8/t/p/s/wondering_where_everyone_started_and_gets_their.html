       I'm really interesting in being "woke" or knowing the truth about this world. I've followed this page for a bit and it seems like everyone knows the same info and some stories though they may disagree with the different parts of it all. I want to know all the things and form my own ideas too. I'm in my 30s and I feel like I'm great at searching the internet but I just don't know where to begin.  It feels like I left a room full of "believe everything you hear zombies" but I'm an outsider in another room just over hearing conversations I can only follow and understand a little.  Where does everyone get their info when it's hard to know who to trust. Where should I start? 9/11 coverup? Clintons? Bush? Russia? Media? New World Order? The Elite? Big Pharmacy? It's seems overwhelming to me but I don't want to miss anything, I don't want to give up, and I want to know this stuff. I want to be about to engage and have a solid fact based opinion. Thanks for any help.

       Everyone's path is different, what worked for me may not work for you.
      </p>
      <p>
       The whole conspiracy landscape covers literally everything and anything that has gone on, that is going on, that will go on.
       <br/>
       I feel it's impossible for any one person to grasp the entirety so only focus on the areas that are interesting to me.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would recommend taking a quick look at any conspiracy subject and see what one's interest you, from there you're likely going to want to watch as many documentaries about that subject as possible. Because now you want answers, your main direction should always be research, then research some more, then more.
      </p>
      <p>
       How deep you go into each sub-conspiracy is your choice, in my opinion however I learnt early on that everything is connected.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I personally choose to do, is when I am researching and gaining new information or opinion, I will often get to a point where it's referencing something I'm not aware of or understand well enough.
I make a note and a bookmark of what that is and make that the next thing I look into.
      </p>
      <p>
       Good luck

       You're very welcome, you can start anywhere you'd like to but it's very important that you question everything.. even things that are given an answers or fact.

       IMO, you can "start" anywhere, wherever you begin will lead you to "the next".

       Also, pace yourself &amp; nurture in-person friendships. When you find a riptide of info that gets emotionally overwhelming, you'll need friends to help decompress. Ideally ones that can handle your curiosity on hard topics, but even if not, at least people to hang out with in person, watch movie or TV with. Touchstone to human contact.

       It really just took an entire lifetime growing up in the south poor for me. My father told me about these lights in the sky in his town and how the neighborhood kids would get in their trucks and run to follow them around. They even wrote about the event in the local newspapers because noone could explain the lights.

       Fast forward to now, working closely with law enforcement and seeing how corruption is systemic. There are good people everywhere, but all it takes is a small group with desires to fuck it all up. Then I started looking towards the justice system, health system, and our military and one thing sticks out like a sore thumb. Every policy isn't written for the citizen, it's for the ones who will profit from it.

       Thanks that's a great plan to start with. I appreciate how you stated where to start and how it would lead. Thanks also for your work with law enforcement. I can see the corruption but I can only imagine what it's like from the inside. Seems like you're one of the good ones and I know there are more than people think but it's sad how like you said it only takes a few to fuck it up.

       When I was pretty young, maybe 11 or 12, I watched a documentary on Fox which detailed the moon landing conspiracy theory. I think that really flipped a switch in my brain and sent me down this path of skepticism. I remember asking my dad about it and he reacted with venom. I never understood that until I got a bit older.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was pretty young and naive at that age (as most are), so it was natural to just assume that the government didn't lie to us. Now I am on the complete opposite side of the spectrum.

       I started out with unsolved mysteries and murders, from there I gravitated toward conspiracy theories because I like critical thinking and learning. In my opinion, the best way to go into researching is to use different news sources and come to your own conclusion.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, keep an open mind and be open to opposing ideas. I've had a few things I thought were true end up being false. Always try to debunk your own theories.

       Now pick a subject you are interested in.  Let us say its Pharmaceutical Industry.  Find a classic pro industry piece and read it, and then search for a critique.   Identify their arguments, and use your judgment on what is right and what is not.  But do it with the background awareness of the principles outlined in the works recommended.   Be conscious of whether the judgment you are making is because of techniques described above, or is it because the arguments are valid and sound.

       I recommend starting at the very beginning with the mystery Babylon series done by Bill Cooper. I made a post recently with transcripts of it, or you can listen to them on YouTube. It's alot to take in, but very worth it if you are wanting to become a conspiracy theorist.

       I became "woke"  during my 6 year stint in the military.  The more you get out into the world,  see the military industrial machine in action,  and see how  people are only pawns in a game to make someone else rich,  it opens your eyes as to why things are the way they are,  and you begin to question everything,  Which is my advice,  question everything.  Take nothing at face value and assume everything you see is propaganda,  a straight lie,  or some form of an attempt to deceive or brainwash you,  and that includes what you see in this sub!
