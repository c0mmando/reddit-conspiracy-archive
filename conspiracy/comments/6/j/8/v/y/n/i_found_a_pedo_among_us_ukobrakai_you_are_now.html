       I hate pedophiles just as much as you but Rule 4 is clear. You are inciting violence on the accused before s/he has been empirically proven guilty. That is not the American way nor is it the way of this sub. Follow the rules or you will be reported.

       It's a myth that being molested leads to
       <strong>
        becoming
       </strong>
       a molestor.   Studies show it's it's a very small percentage that go on to molest others.

       I find pedo's disgusting but that is very true. It is an urge, kind of a curse in a sense. I remember when a guy at my school got caught dropping his pencil under the table and he was smelling the girls feet LOL... We all found it hilarious but for him it was an almost uncontrable urge. You could tell he wasn't happy about it.

       some people are just defective bro; im not saying prison needs to be the way it is now, and a punitive thing, but these fucking monsters do not belong with the rest of us in society.

       i dont want a gay dude in the lockerroom because i know how i couldnt help but think sexual shit if a sexy chick was in the locker room.
      </p>
      <p>
       and i CERTAINLY dont want anyone even looking funny and thinking about what my 4 year old son looks like naked.  maybe the dude thinks "well, ill just follow them into the bathroom and get a look while hes changing his kid, what harm can it do?"
      </p>
      <p>
       if i could read minds, the harm would be all over his face and internal organs.

       lol first of all being in a locker room with a gay dude really isn't that big of a deal, shit you've already probably been in one. Genereally they don't care.
      </p>
      <p>
       And yes in fact you are advocating for them all to be thrown in jail considering you said they shouldn't walk around with the rest of us. If they have already acted then 100% agree they should be locked away for a long time.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, if we provide a place to get help, away from society even, then that seems much more effective in reducing the number of children that will get harmed. If we have the midnight that even if you have thoughts/urges you should automatically get thrown in jail, then they're going to hide and eventually act on it.

       It's not a perfect solution but it should help

       IT IS NOT A FETISH. Jesus Christ are you fucking serious? Fantasizing about child rape is a fetish to you? What fucking planet do you live on. If I didnt already have a rule 4 in this thread I would have a few choice words for you.

       To me it seems like it. Someone that has a fetish for fat chicks generally doesn't decide that, their brain does. Ditto for having a bdsm, foot, henti, blondes, body shape/size, sexual orientation etc etc. To me the same goes with pedophilia. Do you think these people want to be turned on by children? I highly doubt it... I've got my own theory about how pedophilia happens within the brain (I could be totally wrong though.) What I think happens is that the pedophile is sexually active younger and gets sexually attracted to children of the same age. The body ages but the mind, sexually, doesn't. Just my own theory (probably wrong though.)

       He is right though. Pedophiles everywhere. In the last year a close friend was busted for having child porn - everyone was shocked, nobody had a clue - its changed my outlook on people drastically. You have no idea what people are into or what they do when alone at home.

       Don't let it become normal though, it doesn't matter how many perverts there are, before they touch our children they should die. I would take the intellectual loss they could offer to humanity over the societal damage they could cause to young children. Having sex with children isn't beneficial to human beings, their bodies can't handle reproduction, it's strictly a personal preference thing passed through being abused as a child. This is not something we should allow growth in our society, the cycle needs to end with them.
      </p>
      <p>
       I feel bad that they have to suffer by feeling like the outcasts they are, but there are lots of people who get extremely challenging hands in the game of life. I'd rather help people who don't want to have sex with kids. This is probably the coldest thing I've ever said on reddit.

       My ex boyfriend is one, as is his dad
      </p>
      <p>
       Found out his father was one first, after he got caught trying to buy sex with a 13yo in Florida and a computer packed with pizza.
      </p>
      <p>
       I should have realized sooner, but didn't find out until I found his subscriptions to fucked up fetish sites and his downloaded pics/vids. He didn't think I knew how to do a simple search through someone's computer and just left everything out in the open.
      </p>
      <p>
       The laughable part is that he just straight up LOOKS like he's a pedo. All the fucking signs were there and I can't believe it took me so long to realize it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even with all of the signs staring people in the face, some just don't want to think that the people close to them are completely different when they are alone and think people are not looking.

       I don't mean to stereotype, but the typical 'look' that you see presented in the mainstream: super skelatal, dark circles under sunken eyes, wispy pedo mustache, long greasy hair. It's pretty ridiculous how much his looks just scream "I have a fetish for kidnapping underage girls and raping them in the back of a van"
      </p>
      <p>
       Which coincidentally was one of the websites I found him subscribed to. He would go on a lot of chat rooms and 'role play' some pretty terrible scenarios. I found all of them and was just floored. I don't think he ever took me seriously when I said I'm really good with computers, and just left everything out in the open. Pretty sure he thought incognito windows and clearing his browser history is enough to hide it still lol

       people who touch kids should be locked up. that's a crime. furthermore its immoral. most importantly it's quantifiable and something THAT ACTUALLY HAPPENED.

       i'm not defending the people who commit acts on children, i'm defending people who have the right to think what they want and have an opinion on what they want. if you have a problem with the way someone THINKS and actually think that you or other people should act upon it, you're completely fucking ass backwards

       let me ask you this:
      </p>
      <p>
       would it be a problem for you, in a relationship, if you knew your partner did not want to have sex with you but instead wanted to fuck your brother, but was only with you because your brother was married?
      </p>
      <p>
       it doesnt matter at all right, because its just a thought that will never be acted upon.

       that's a ridiculous analogy but i'll humor you for the sake of argument:
      </p>
      <p>
       it would bother me, of course. it wouldn't cause me to start raving at her friends/family/the general public about a thought that may or may not have occured and will never be acted upon. furthermore, it wouldn't lead me to wish death upon my partner, nor would it lead me to try to jail them. at most it would result in a divorce due to the fact that we're no longer compatible. but none of this matters because i'm not married to people who have opinions on pedophilia

       Wasn't me that said it's a witch hunt but I do agree that it could appear that way with the fact you have targeted another user.

       So now you spooked him. There will be no useful evidence, a new account, and a more careful commenter here...

       Thanks for speaking out, though. It's an uphill battle, but it needs to be fought.

       you're right, my blood boils when it comes to that. I am the father of a baby girl. But I wasn't talking about that user in particular, just pedophiles in general. I appreciate your calm reasoned response.

       To me it seems like it. Someone that has a fetish for fat chicks generally doesn't decide that, their brain does. Ditto for having a bdsm, foot, henti, blondes, body shape/size, sexual orientation etc etc. To me the same goes with pedophilia. Do you think these people want to be turned on by children? I highly doubt it... I've got my own theory about how pedophilia happens within the brain (I could be totally wrong though.) What I think happens is that the pedophile is sexually active younger and gets sexually attracted to children of the same age. The body ages but the mind, sexually, doesn't. Just my own theory (probably wrong though.)
