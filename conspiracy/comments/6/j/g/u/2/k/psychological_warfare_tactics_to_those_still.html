       Psychological warfare Tactics
      </p>
      <p>
       Psychological warfare is defined as techniques used “to influence a target-audience’s value systems, belief systems, emotions, motives, reasoning, or behavior”. Military and intelligence agencies invest significant resources into psychological warfare capabilities because they’re highly effective.
      </p>
      <p>
       Desired effects or outcomes of psychological warfare:-
      </p>
      <p>
       Learned helplessness
      </p>
      <p>
       The target may be made to feel it is useless to resist his attackers, because everything he does makes things worse. Or he may end up limiting his own actions, even when the harassment and blacklisting have died down, simply because he has internalized the futility of past similar actions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Discreditation
      </p>
      <p>
       Discreditation seems to be a major goal of most psychological warfare campaigns. The way this is typically finalized is through the collusion of several people who appear to be disinterested third parties rendering a judgment against the target. A trusted authority figure will then signs off on that judgment and make it official. The official judgment may be legal, journalistic, or medical/psychological, for example.
Prior to the judgment, the target will often be driven to discredit him in the eyes of onlookers through a combination of sleep deprivation, extreme harassment, and most importantly, psychological warfare with the goal of changing his perceptions of the world around him. The target’s new perceptions will be so out of line with reality (or consensus reality) that the discrediting final blow will be made easy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Self-destruction
      </p>
      <p>
       The target may be driven to extreme measures in an attempt to get rid of his perceived attackers, or fight back at them. The target will have no idea of who’s really after him, or what their capabilities are, and so these measures will usually prove futile and costly. Poverty, homelessness, or institutionalization is common outcomes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Grid awareness
      </p>
      <p>
       Several targets have spontaneously confided beliefs to me along the lines of, “The people behind this don’t want anyone to be free.” I don’t think their shared views are a coincidence.
Many targets will become aware of an invisible control grid which can destroy them at a moment’s notice using techniques I’ve described here. Their new awareness, which I call grid awareness, will guide their actions and cause them to fall into line. The campaign will not necessarily stop once the target has grid awareness, but at least the campaign objectives will become more obvious to the target.

       The people coming after you are limited in what they can do, or they would have killed you already. They may not want to kill you, or they may not be able to get away with killing you at this time. For this and other reasons, their attacks on you have to stay deniable. Every episode you experience, taken individually, can usually be explained as something else.
You can think of protecting yourself in terms of forcing them to show their hand in order to get at you; if you can arrange this, they’ll back off, as they want to stay hidden.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your reputation is the primary target
      </p>
      <p>
       Many targets correctly perceive that their reputation (or credibility) is at stake. Once a target’s credibility is gone, his harassers can get away with anything. And I do mean anything.
There are several ways to get at your reputation. The most obvious way is through your mind. If you can be tricked into acting recklessly or foolishly, or making unfounded accusations, you’ve done your harassers’ dirty work for them.
Your relative inexperience with the way society’s institutions really work, compared to the people running your campaign, also helps with attacks on your reputation. There are several institutional traps that have been set, ready for you to stumble into.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your mind is the secondary target
      </p>
      <p>
       The constant harassment and deception that’s part of your campaign is an all-out assault on your mind. Psychological warfare is the perfect weapon, as it is not obvious to anyone except the targeted person or group. The deception and manipulation they use against you leaves no evidence behind, but your reactions to it, and resulting bad decisions, will have real and long-lasting impact on your life.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are behavioral adaptations you can make which will help you cope with psychological assaults: see the psychological defenses section.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some damaging assaults will be mixed together with constant threats, and you’ll never know which threat is real, amplifying the psychological impact of the damaging attacks. However, you can make certain changes in your environment which will make damaging assaults to you or your possessions much harder to get away with; at that point, you’re left only with psychological attacks, which are an annoyance, but may at least be tolerable.
There are hidden elements of society have been combined into a machine which can end a person’s life blamelessly, and with no one person committing a capital crime.
      </p>
      <p>
       Once you’ve been discredited – after the police start ignoring your calls, and your associates write you off as a lunatic – it’s open season on you. Everyone can get a piece of you. Any kind of experiment can be performed on you, and you can no longer defend yourself, because you will no longer be believed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Protect your credibility; without it, everything else you have will soon be stripped from you.
It is very common for targets to be blacklisted, both as employees and as business owners. They will frequently experience significant property damage, highway accidents, assaults, and more. What I’m describing in this document is not only a way to change a target’s perceptions; it serves as a force multiplier for the physically or financially harmful episodes many targets go through, amplifying a few of life’s dips into life-destroying traumatic experiences.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why they don’t just kill you
      </p>
      <p>
       They are killing you, by stealing your life. What you’re really wondering is: “Why don’t they just put a bullet in my head instead of going to all this trouble?”
In fact, some targeted people are killed with a minimum of fuss. Nobody will ever know how many targets were made to die from conveniently timed ailments, or whose deaths were made to look accidental or like a suicide; the decision to kill a targeted individual is based in part on the calculation that the manner of his death will not make waves.
There is a survivor bias in the population of targeted individuals that are aware of their special status and complaining about it. For any given targeted individual who is still alive, there is an unusual reason that person hasn’t been or can’t be killed yet.
One or more of these answers will apply to your situation:
1. They never intended to kill you.
2. They might have wanted you dead, but you’ve survived all the obvious traps. Now the goal is “keeping you down” or protecting themselves by intimidating you into not talking about your experiences.
3. The group coming after you isn’t sophisticated enough to kill you in a deniable way.
4. As a whistleblower, witness, or dissident, your untimely death may make you a martyr, in which case the goal is to discredit you, or otherwise make it impossible for you to do whatever was threatening the people behind the campaign.
5. Even if there’s no political risk in killing you, the people coming after you never know when they themselves are being set up for a fall; an obvious murder will trigger an unending investigation that could eventually entrap the killer.
6. You’re too obviously young and healthy to be made sick.
7. It’s more important to keep the people harassing you busy than to get rid of you. For example, your life may have value as target practice for a vigilante gang.
      </p>
      <p>
       To all my tortured souls out there, from what I have learned so far there's not much you can do to stop them outside of just living your life and giving them nothing to talk about.. Stop letting it affect you and see what that does for you before you try anything else..
      </p>
      <p>
       FEAR, its about the mastery of it, not the absence of it.. We never lose our demons, we just learn to live above them.. You have all the power imaginable. If you can't see that yet, it's possibly b/c you're allowing someone or something block your view. Switch your mentality from "i'm broken and helpless" to "i'm growing and healing" and watch how fast your life changes, for the better.

       I haven't had any success finding any info on how to find them but It's obvious who these people are.. The problem is there's really no way to catch them.. You gotta remember the military has all kinds of technology that isn't accessible to the general public.. There shit is advanced at least 10-15 years and this has been going on since the late 80s..These people are smart man. They cover there tracks perfectly.. Some sick government agency prick's with no morals

       As a targeted individual for 20 years, I can definitely say by your writing you know of what you speak, especially:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The target may be made to feel it is useless to resist his attackers, because everything he does makes things worse. Or he may end up limiting his own actions, even when the harassment and blacklisting have died down, simply because he has internalized the futility of past similar actions.
