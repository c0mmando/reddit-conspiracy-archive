       That is a bit of a commitment for the video, so I'm not sure people will watch it. However, your list of perpetrators is correct, but incomplete. There are also the anti-Castro Cubans, disgruntled military/intelligence, LBJ/Dallas police/Texas oil men, and of course, Alan Dulles. This is not a wide conspiracy, but it is a conspiracy who have the power to arrange it, do it, and cover it up.

       I'm not concerned whether or not it is a commitment. Anyone who
       <em>
        really
       </em>
       wants to redpill themselves on not just JFK, but how the elite gained a grip on this world
       <strong>
        needs
       </strong>
       to watch it.

       It's pretty much required watching for Conspiracy 101. People can space it out over a week for all I care, but they owe it themselves to watch it.

       I don't disagree with you. I'm just not sure it's the starting point for people new to JFK unless they have a real interest. Then again I've watched and read so much JFK stuff it's hard to judge.
      </p>
      <p>
       From my perspective JFK is the corner stone of the development/solidification of the deep state, military/intelligence, banking/corporate control.

       What I mean is Olswald was the lone nut assassin.

       Totally agreed, man. JFK is what got me into conspiracies when I was around 14. Fuck, I've probably forgotten more about that assassination than a lot of folks know.

      <p>
       You are absolutely right, Nov 22rd 1963 is (in my opinion) the day the Deep State solidified total control over this country.

       Most likely yes to all of them, each acting in the interest of the unknown entity that controls all of them. TPTB, whomever they are, wanted Kennedy dead for the same reason they wanted MLK, Gandhi, Malcom X, John Lennon, Tupac, Bob Marley, etc dead... they all had the power to positively change the world. And typically speaking, what's good for the world, aka the people, isn't good for those at the top who are trying to control the people. Every one of those inspirational people had the ability to help break the chains of control that TPTB have spend centuries building for us.

       I don't disagree but people are idiots who actually think Bob Marley or Tupac were killed by any typr of CIA or intelligence agency.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fucking Tupac stomped the living dogshit out of a crip member an hour before getting shot. His crew had numerous altercations with that member. Everyone who thinks logically knows that is why he died.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Games song called Start From Scratch said "I wish Pac never stomped out Orlando.'
      </p>
      <p>
       Bob Marley denied any form of medical treatment because it was against his religion. I could die from MRSA if I refuse to take anti-biotics.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not everyone revolutionary individual was killed by some conspiracy involving the government.

       Disagree with tupac, how did the crips just know where pac was driving too? Did they just watch orlando get beat and decide to hide so they could tail tupac?  This is actually the perfect cover up killing him right after an altercation everyone could blame it on. 
Im also not saying they didnt kill him but if they did they had HELP but from who?

       Tupac got shot, not sure whether it was a result of messing with the Crips or something larger.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bob Marley died of cancer barely past thirty. That's rare. It started in his toes, where he got spiked by a copper weird thing left in a pair of cleats given to him by the son of the director of the CIA. That one's tougher to toss, man.

       I'd recommend not calling people idiots, regardless of their beliefs.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's plenty of reasons to suspect that both Tupac and Bob Marley were killed in ways other than what the public was told. Just because you aren't aware of these nuanced aspects of the story, doesn't mean that they are wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       Rather than just immediately try to tell people what happened because you think you "know" about it already, how about instead you try and open up a dialogue, asking them why they might believe such things you believe to be false?
      </p>
      <p>
       Calling other people idiots won't help anyone.

       I actually shouldn't have called them idiots and you also shouldn't have assumed that I haven't looked into Tupac being killed and all points of views about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is absolutely nothing there. It's pretty easy to see he was killed in relation to the guy he just kicked in the face an hour before that.
      </p>
      <p>
       But sure we can keep saying the CIA killed Tupac when there isn't even circumstantial evidence on the subject.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's disinfo to add to the pile. But sure send me the evidence if it isn't a stupid theory.

       I believe Oswald is the only person who spoke the truth that day and the years that followed.  I am the patsy said he. I don't think Oswald fired any shots.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for what happened, the evidence seems to say, the conspiracy included conservatives inside and outside the U.S. government and the ones outside the government leaned to what was then Birchers but who had earlier been McCarthyites and before that something called the Liberty Boys. Very rich bastards who hate the very idea of a democratic republic with a well paid and voting working class.
      </p>
      <p>
       So on the day of the assassination there was a coalition of wealthy conservatives and their allies in the government.  It included political and economic conservatives and it was intended to stop the power the working and middle class had acquired. Co-conspirators seem to have included international organized crime figures.
      </p>
      <p>
       After the assassination the "New World Order," to bring about a peaceful planet with human rights for all changed to a NWO with a few very wealthy exploiting the planet and all humans for their own profitable gains along with a lot of violence and wealth theft, during the Nixon Presidency elected via treason,  the treason to elect Reagan, the theft of the 2000 election.
      </p>
      <p>
       See how much harder it has been to destroy us than they planned?
      </p>
      <p>
       However even those changes were not enough and that war continued until this latest coup, the staged election of 2016.
      </p>
      <p>
       The JFK assassination started a long war against ordinary people all over the planet, not just the U.S.A.

         Conservatives in the 60s were members of the Democratic party. Something you obviously were not aware of because you said "democrats didn't do nothing"

       Conservatives killed JFK. Conservatives were members of the Democratic party. How can you say they claimed democrats did nothing wrong when they're blaming them for killing JFK?

       JFK was an heir to the elite/old money Roman Catholic Kennedy Dynasty. He knew a shit tonne about how the deep State actually works and who is involved. He was not the choice of his father, his older brother was, but he died in war. His father thought he could control John, so John it was.
      </p>
      <p>
       John and his brother were investigating high levels of the mafia, and pissing off the CIA (Jesuits). He declined the CIA/MIC on a number of nefarious/traitorous false flags.
      </p>
      <p>
       He, via his family/bloodline and his knowledge, was too powerful/important/dangerous to just do the normal smear, spin, black mail, etc etc they normally do with presidents. He had to be taken out.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, the CIA with the mafia coordinated the hit, with what I think was the complicity of his father. There was most likely 4-5 snipers, all given the order to assassinate, while Oswald was the patsy fall guy (possibly a victim of MKULTRA) . The one that did it in for him, was the shooter in the storm drain

       It was the CIA. JFK gained a lot of enemies because he wanted to abolish the FR and make peace with Russia among other things.

       National Crime Syndicate sponsored hit in retaliation for JFK going back on his father's word that if key underworld figures helped influence the election for Kennedy he would give them a pass.  Instead RFK with the blessing of his brother went after those same underworld bosses in an unprecedented way and went to far as to publicly embarrass them in televised hearings.
      </p>
      <p>
       FBI  helped to cover up the hit because J. Edgar Hoover was a NCS operative having gone as far in the past to deny the existence of an organized underworld hierarchy.  They had been black mailing Hoover because they had knowledge and evidence he was a degenerate gambler, Crossdresser, and probably Homosexual.
      </p>
      <p>
       The FBI checked records for local Dallas nut-jobs and found Lee Oswald at the top of the list.  Planted evidence, framed him up, created a media circus, recruited local mobster to help cover it all up by assassinating Oswald.  Later doctored photo of Oswald standing with rifle and newspaper.

       Oswald did two shots, but I saw a tv prog recently that made a good case for a security guy in the back seat of a following car accidentally firing his rifle as he got up with it to shoot at the book depository window (having realised shots were coming from there.)..but was jolted by the car accelerating..and it went off hitting JFKs head.

       I'm not concerned whether or not it is a commitment. Anyone who
       <em>
        really
       </em>
       wants to redpill themselves on not just JFK, but how the elite gained a grip on this world
       <strong>
        needs
       </strong>
       to watch it.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's pretty much required watching for Conspiracy 101. People can space it out over a week for all I care, but they owe it themselves to watch it.
