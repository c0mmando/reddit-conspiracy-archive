       The whole idea of Reptilians.
       <br/>
       I know that I know nothing, yet something about the Reptilian story doesn't sit right with me.
       <br/>
       The best explanation of Reptilians I have seen is that they are just people who are psychopaths/sociopaths that are high up in power, which would explain the emotionlessness, lack of empathy and coldness.
According to Occams Razor, the most simple hypothesis is usually correct.
       <br/>
       But, the thought of the Queen being a shape shifting reptile doesn't quite feel true.

       Then why even bother saying reptilian? We don't have to be politically correct by using code words to describe psychopaths. I've never understood the whole "reptilian is just a code word" thing. Why would there be a need to be secret about it?

       Yes, I agree. It does feel strange to me how people claim to be 'awake', yet they still follow political leaders and have strong political beliefs whilst dismissing anything of value and truth, and get all their knowledge from MSM.
       <br/>
       It's like the false awakening, while there is higher truth waiting to be found, I hope they can see past the division and come together in the long run...

       I don't agree with that at all. People trying to say that any of this Archon and reptilian stuff is metaphorical are usually just struggling to comprehend something so fantastical. Reptilians are the interdimensional beings you've spoken of before, appearing in that form to cause the most fear. This is a fear-based matrix system and that's what they do. It doesn't mean they are walking lizards.

       The bloodlines and inter-dimensional beings go hand in hand. Not sure why you thought I meant anything different by what I said. It's not black and white nor is it one or the other.

       is this for dubious explanations provided to account for conspiracies, like "the apollo space capsule was moving too fast for the radiation in the can allen belts to get them," or something most people just take as fact like, "whether he was really god, jesus really exsisted?"
      </p>
      <p>
       the jesus one is the one that gets me, there was never such a person. he was a literary invention by titus to deflect from the blame he gotvwhen vesuvius erupted. everyone took it as a sign of divine retribution for having sacked jerusalem  (romans were equal opportunity condemners--they didn't care whose god you pissed off, pissing off any was viewed askance).
      </p>
      <p>
       summary:
      </p>
      <p>
       the jews had a messianic relgion.
      </p>
      <p>
       during nero's reign, the messianic zealot cults in palestine (that's what it's name was back then so swollow your down votes) were engaging in increasingly annoying and bothersome "terrorism" against romans stationed there. they also refused to acknowledge nero was a god in his own right (nero was cool with insincerity on their part, but not intransigence). so finally in 68-69, he sends vespasian and his son titus to reign hell down upon them, which they did swiftly and efficiently.
      </p>
      <p>
       nero died without an heir before the campaign was complete. rome went through 4 coups in one year, vespasian emeged victorious becoming the firt non-julio-claudian emperor, and left titus to finish things up in jerusalem. in 70, titus did so spectacularly.
      </p>
      <p>
       vespasian didn't live long. titus became emperor, and as was the custom had his father diefied by the senate, making himself, literally, the son of god. the vesuvius happens. the people in rome already didn't like him, before he apparently caused the annihilation of herculaneum and pompeii.
      </p>
      <p>
       titus is acknowledged as one of the most skillful propagandist and censor rome ever had. he got his pet jew, josephus, whom his family, the flavians, has adopted to create a messiah prophecy that predicts titus's sack of jeruslem.
      </p>
      <p>
       josephus had already released the account of the actual campaign, so he took the account and sculpted a story, the gospel of mark, that followed titus's campaign, wherein jesus prophesies every thing titus did and he does it while following titus's march and metaphorically acting out titus's actions, thus titus fufills the prophecy if the jew condemning, pro-roman jesus.
      </p>
      <p>
       the story gets published. people decide herculaneum and pompeii must have fucked themselves. titus builds the coliseum and becomes one of the most popular emperors ever and creates a religion he didn't intend but didn't object to either (he created lots of religions. it was his hobby).
      </p>
      <p>
       unlike atwill, who makes convulted leaps trying to prove that titus was trying to convert jews to a new pro-roman judaism in order to keep them from rebelling, i doubt that anyone outside of rome itself even was aware of josephus's history and subsequent gospel. titus had just squashed the jews like bugs, i guarantee he didn't think of them at all afterwards, let alone as a threat.
      </p>
      <p>
       i also believe this why mark, universally considered the oldest of the 4 gospels, doesn't have the rising dieing -god mystical birth story in it. the gospel was supposed to sound jewish and jews didn't do the whole rising-dieing-god thing. the other gospels include it because by their time christianity was a bastardized version of mithraism--i.e. a roman religion, for romans, who like their gods to make spectacular entrances.
      </p>
      <p>
       moral of the story: becareful what joke religions you release on the earth, someone is going to run with them.
      </p>
      <p>
       for angry christians, on the verge of downvoting me to oblivian, have pity on a heretical atheist when casting your stones and all...

       The mainstream conspiracy theory that Hillary stole the primary from Sanders whose voters then gave the election to Trump.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Republicans did the voter removals and vote blocking, not the DNC however it is also obvious that people inside the Democratic party leadership were working for the Republicans to help create this impression.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was all one long political dirty trick and a coup.

       You're kinda all over the place with this one, are you trying to say that the Republicans helped screw over Bernie? And that Hilary was in on a plan to give the election to Trump? Please clarify, because this sounds interesting. Don't think I've heard about this theory before.

       I don't think Hillary was exactly "in" on the plans but that means she was stupidly blind which is worse and even you know that a Hillary win would only have delivered the same result, a crisis we were screwed beginning with that 2012 Obama win.  The billionaire conservatives were not going to take any chances and that is when the planning began.
