       I've browsed conspiracy for hundreds maybe thousands of hours.
      </p>
      <p>
       Covering topics from the deep state, arctic bases, nuclear 9/11, project blue beam, space elevators, aliens, Extra dimensional meddling forces... basically almost everything.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, tell us something new. Give us your most plausible/most out there theories folks! So we can get a discussion going and maybe research into your out there theory.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit because people are bitching:
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know anything that you probably don't already know or haven't seen before. Hence why I'm asking for something new. Although if you want something without any backing I believe spirits or souls of some sort are real and that the governments are covering up ancient history because the ancients knew and wrote about said spirits/souls
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit 2: phone is about to die but you guys have posted some amazing stuff from enlightening piss to converging universes, love it! I'll get some research done and you can expect a fully fledged post/theory sometime soon!

       Hmm I like it, my friend told me of a cold spot in the universe that scientists have recently theorised it could be an alternate universe bleeding into our own. I'll try and find the source for it if you give me a few. Meanwhile I'll also google quantum solar shift as I have no clue what that is! Thank you for your valuable input!

       and makes a nice explanation of what the smart people are saying haha. The stuff about the helical solar system comes from a dude in india, a botanist I believe, who after a like 30 something years of career, jsut dropped a book with that theory out of nowhere. I had found the book online somewhere and it was very detailed so it's not some kind of in the air out of nothing theory either haha

       I've taken some before but not enough to break through and probably not done correctly. Although even when I did it incorrectly shit gets weird my friend. It's definitely on the bucket list to break through on that stuff.

       Yeah, I read a post yesterday describing 3 stages of astral projection 1. Seeing around the room stuff you shouldn't see, shadows and whatnot, machine elves if there's any etc 2. You can astral project around earth, 3. full blown breakthrough inexplicable experience

       Yeah I've seen things I can never unsee on psychs. Like the shadows and patterns and things. Never got any further but I've been trying to astral project for a while I just cannot do it for some reason. I blame insomnia.

       Interesting but I'd be wary of mainstream sources for space stuff for now, a lot of them are spouting half-truths on certain subjects. Futurism, Motherboard and ScienceAlert have some good some bad in them
      </p>
      <p>
       Parallel universes of some kind are probably a thing, but I wouldn't expect a cold spot in space to prove it or hint at it imo
      </p>
      <p>
       Some interesting thing about dimensions though, I've read somethign about there being 11 dimensions and all and this drops not too long ago:

       Well reinhardt gehlen was given military sponsorship and placed in charge of russian soviet espionage operations. plus the 100 hand picked nazis he negotiated to take with him who were wafflen ss officers, were all given new identities. they became americans but had horizontal allegiance to each other first

       it's terrifying because he basically lied to keep his job. russia had lost 20 million people to ww2. their major cities and western farm land was destroyed. they were literally pulling up the railroad lines that went into europe for steel to rebuild their economy. gehlen told our military leaders russia was preparing to invade europe, a complete misrepresentation bc of his devestated the war left them. ultimately all this soviet red scare could be traced back to him, and the interests of clients of brown brothers harriman who were legal clients of sullivan and cromwell.

Why is Merkel hell bent on destroying Germany with her EU immigration policy, if the Nazis survived wouldn't they be looking after the well being of Germans ?

       Merkel is with globalists so it makes sense she wants it destroyed, but you raise a good point, I really don't know. We know TPTB/Globalists are talmud zionists, but hitler doesn't fit that

       Tobacco is harmful because of the type of fertilizers they choose to use. Other countries that don't use these fertilizers don't have half the amount of lung cancer cases as the US. It's because our fertilizers come from deep underground from ore that is also rich in heavy metals like uranium. Those heavy metals are seeded all throughout the fertilizer that is spread on the tobacco fields. Tobacco is a hairy plant, and those heavy metal particles get trapped in the hairs, processed with the tobacco, and eventually inhaled by smokers.

       In other words, the industry has been given a green light to give people lung cancer. Who wants to bet the same parties invested in tobacco, are also invested in cancer research and treatment?

       You're welcome. I was a smoker myself for 26 years, the last ten of which I rolled my own non-filter cigarettes. I could feel them killing me. I started vaping in the beginning of last year, and I haven't smoked since. I started off just buying the ejuice, but ended up making it myself. It only costs me about $60 a year now, and I'm planning on quitting it as well, when ready.
      </p>
      <p>
       Get yourself a $36 "Voopoo Drag" regulated vaporizer, a bottle of 10% nicotine solution, large bottles of vegetable glycerin and propylene glycol, and whatever flavors your pallet fancies from one of the many providers and you can easily quit smoking.

       That is amazing, both the info you imparted about fertilizer as well as your path to vaping.  How rough was the conversion?  I mean, did your body buck the different taste/feel of the vape?  Or did it pass without any psychological or physiological aches?
      </p>
      <p>
       Because if the transition was easy, it seems almost dumb to not switch.  Especially when you now pay annually for vape what people pay for a carton of cigs.  I think they are $60 now, right?  Non smoker, but seems about right.

       It was as easy as pie. As long as you have at least one tobacco flavoring, which contains chemicals thought to have a concert effect in easing tobacco withdrawal. Yes, i think they are about $60 a carton, now. I think even more in places like NYC, like $100 a carton! Yes, it was a very easy transition :)

       Yes, the most important thing is really wanting it. In addition, coming to understand the role fertilizers play in giving people lung cancer, a complete lack of regulation from the authorities to do anything about it, and the industries indifference to it all, really helped me quit.

       I heard something similar about kale, as it holds onto fertilizer due to its leaf properties that it needs to be washed amazingly well so as to not do more harm than good.  I didn't know about the heavy metals thing though.  Wouldn't that negatively affect all farmed goods?  Or you think it just the leafy ones?

       I think it has the potential to effect any plants that can easily retain small particles, like what you've mentioned about kale. However, I don't think all crops use mined phosphates, but I have no idea which ones do, and don't. I suppose I should learn more about it.

       No, your point was about tobacco.  I asked as a curiosity about the other veg.  Guessing mined phosphate isn't commonly used for all fertilizer.

       Indeed.  I think it has been generally understood that chemicals are added to increase the addictiveness.  Add chemicals to make them sick too, then invest in products that treat that sickness and voila - quite a money making machine.

       That George Bush knew nothing about the attack on 9/11. In fact, afterwards, he saved us from a far worst outcome. Remember when he became the decider? I recall a couple other tidbits which support this theory. Still, all theory.

       Mainly it was his look when reading the story to the kids. He didn't know about it, but he knew who did it. Cheney also mentioned something about Bush not going through with it. Just a vague recollection. Doubt I could find it again. Bush Sr also distanced his son from Cheney and Rumsfeld.  Again, forgot the exact language. I'm any case, according to Wesley Clark , it's 7 nations that were to be overthrown. Something appears to have happened for that not to have occured. Bastards are still trying though.

       Merkel is with globalists so it makes sense she wants it destroyed, but you raise a good point, I really don't know. We know TPTB/Globalists are talmud zionists, but hitler doesn't fit that
