        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p><a href="https://theintercept.com/2017/06/27/cnn-journalists-resign-latest-example-of-media-recklessness-on-the-russia-threat/">https://theintercept.com/2017/06/27/cnn-journalists-resign-latest-example-of-media-recklessness-on-the-russia-threat/</a></p>

<p>Greenwald offers a thorough critique of the media landscape</p>

<p>It starts with the CNN resignations.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The resignations follow CNN’s Friday night retraction of the story, in which it apologized to Scaramucci:</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The next point he makes is deeply embarrassing to the MSM:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>To begin with, CNN’s story was first debunked by an article in Sputnik News, which explained that the investment fund documented several “factual inaccuracies” in the report (including that the fund is not even part of the Russian bank, Vnesheconombank, that is under investigation), and by Breitbart, which cited numerous other factual inaccuracies.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This follows CNN making a blunder earlier this month:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And this episode follows an embarrassing correction CNN was forced to issue earlier this month when several of its highest-profile on-air personalities asserted — based on anonymous sources — that James Comey, in his congressional testimony, was going to deny Trump’s claim that the FBI director assured him he was not the target of any investigation.</p>

<p>When Comey confirmed Trump’s story, CNN was forced to correct its story. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The scope increases.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But CNN is hardly alone when it comes to embarrassing retractions regarding Russia. Over and over, major U.S. media outlets have published claims about the Russia Threat that turned out to be completely false — always in the direction of exaggerating the threat and/or inventing incriminating links between Moscow and the Trump circle. In virtually all cases, those stories involved evidence-free assertions from anonymous sources that these media outlets uncritically treated as fact, only for it to be revealed that they were entirely false.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The WaPo story about Russia hacking the Vermont utility grid is there:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Literally every facet of that story turned out to be false. First, the utility company — which the Post had not bothered to contact — issued a denial, pointing out that malware was found on one laptop that was not connected either to the Vermont grid or the broader U.S. electricity grid. That forced the Post to change the story to hype the still-alarmist claim that this malware “showed the risk” posed by Russia to the U.S. electric grid, along with a correction at the top repudiating the story’s central claim:</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The WaPo story about a list containing Russia propaganda outlets is there:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Less than a month before its electric grid farce, the Post published a blockbuster story — largely based on a blacklist issued by a brand new, entirely anonymous group — featuring the shocking assertion that stories planted or promoted by Russia’s “disinformation campaign” were viewed more than 213 million times.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Slate story about secret Trump server communicating with the Russians is there:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Weeks earlier, Slate — owned by the Washington Post company — published another article that went viral on Trump and Russia, claiming that a secret server had been discovered that the Trump Organization used to communicate with a Russian bank. After that story was hyped by Hillary Clinton herself, multiple news outlets (including The Intercept) debunked it, noting that the story had been shopped around for months but found no takers. Ultimately, the Post itself made clear how reckless its claims were:</p>
</blockquote>

<p>CSPAN is there about being hacked by RT:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Correction: This story originally ran under the headline &quot;C-SPAN Confirms It Was Briefly Hacked by Russian News Site.&quot; C-SPAN confirmed that an interruption took place but has not yet identified the cause of the interruption.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Guardian is there about fabricating stories concerning Assange:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Guardian published a story by reporter Ben Jacobs claiming that WikiLeaks and its founder, Julian Assange, had “long had a close relationship with the Putin regime.” That claim, along with several others in the story, was fabricated, and The Guardian was forced to append a retraction to the story:</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Greenwald offers a salient point about journalism itself:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A related, and perhaps more significant, dynamic is that journalistic standards are often dispensed with when it comes to exaggerating the threat posed by countries deemed to be the official enemy du jour. That is a journalistic principle that has repeatedly asserted itself, with Iraq being the most memorable but by no means only example.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Before concluding that all this does is empower the Trump administration to mistreat the press, Greenwald offer a piece of foreign policy wisdom that has been lost in the McCarthyism:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Ratcheting up tensions between these two historically hostile powers is incredibly inflammatory and dangerous. All kinds of claims, no matter how little evidence there is to support them, have flooded U.S. political discourse and have been treated as proven fact.</p>
</blockquote>

    <div class="md"><p>Greenwald has been one of the most intellectually consistent and honest reporters since the early Bush years. He was one of the select few on the left that continued to call out abuses after Obama came to power and now he&#39;s vilified by corporate dems for his critiques of Hillary and smeared as just another Kremlin agent. We don&#39;t deserve him and yet I&#39;m thrilled that he consistently produces the work that he does. </p>
