        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>Recently Midnight in the Desert released some purported Majestic 12 documents which can be found in PDF form <a href="http://d3adcc0j1hezoq.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Ultra-Top-Secret-MITD-RotateLARGE.pdf">here</a>. Without verifying if the document itself is 100% real, I spent some time investigating if the information contained within the document line up with established history and if there is any public information which might lend more credence to the answers the EBE gives during the interview or to the information about reverse engineering of Alien crafts.  </p>

<h1>EBE Interview Implications</h1>

<p>The EBE makes some remarkable statements implying that Tesla and Marconi were both the recipients of radio signals that did not have terrestial origin. The responses we are interested in are <a href="http://imgur.com/a/b49J9">here</a> (along with some statements from Tesla in 1900 to match the timeline). The EBE states that Tesla made contact in 1899, and they responded immediately. Tesla makes the claim in 1900 that he has made contact with another planet. The  EBE also make the claim that they contacted Marconi with the letter &#39;V&#39; in his own code. </p>

<h1>Guglielmo Marconi</h1>

<p>I did some digging and found a paper titled: &quot;An Historic Report on Life in Space: Tesla, Marconi, Todd&quot;. This paper was presented at the American Rocket Society, 17th annual meeting, November 13–18, 1962, in Los Angeles. A cached version of that paper can be found <a href="http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:i7tWFC04whEJ:www.anakinovni.org/marconi.htm+&amp;cd=1&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=us">here</a>. The following is an excerpt from that peper:</p>

<p>In Newfoundland in 1901, he (Marconi) received the first radio signal sent across the Atlantic. People were wowed, Marconi became well-to-do and built a mobile laboratory on his yacht the Electra, so that he could work in privacy. As Electra sailed the Mediterranean in 1921, Marconi received a signal that he viewed as being of interplanetary origin. The London manager of the Marconi Wireless Telegraph Company, J. C. H. MacBeth, reported this news:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The signals . . . registered high in the meter band, although the maximum length of earth-produced waves at the time was 14,000 meters. The theory that the waves were produced by electrical disturbances was disproved by the regularity of the pulses. Although the pulses apparently consisted of a code, the only signal similar to earth codes was one resembling the letter “V” in the Marconi Code. Marconi himself expressed the belief that the signal had  originated . . . at some point in outerspace.</p>
</blockquote>

<h1>Nikola Tesla</h1>

<p>As shown in the images above, Tesla&#39;s timeline of events matches with the EBE&#39;s responses. In the paper &quot;Nikola Tesla and the Planetary Radio Signals&quot; by K.J Corum and J.F. Corum (<a href="http://www.teslasociety.com/mars.pdf">reference</a>) we get to see Tesla&#39;s thinking behind that letter he sent to the American Red Cross:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The changes I noted were taking place periodically, and with such a clear suggestion of number and order that they were not traceable to any cause then known to me. I was familiar, of course, with such electrical disturbances as are produced by the sun, Aurora Borealis and earth currents, and I was as sure as I could be of any fact that these variations were due to none of these causes. The nature of my experiments precluded the possibility of the changes being produced by atmospheric disturbances, as has been rashly asserted by some. It was some time afterward when the thought flashed upon my mind that the disturbances I had observed might be due to an intelligent control. Although I could not decipher their meaning, it was impossible for me to think of them as having been entirely accidental. The feeling is constantly growing on me that I had been the first to hear the greeting of one planet to another. A purpose was behind these electrical signals; and it was with this conviction that I announced to the Red Cross Society, when it asked me to indicate one of the great possible achievements of the next hundred years, that it would probably be the confirmation and interpretation of this planetary challenge to us. </p>
</blockquote>

<h1>Aztec Vehicle Reverse Engineering</h1>

<p>For a summary of the Aztec crash, I recommend this page <a href="http://www.frankthayer.net/Aztec.html">here</a> which cites the work of Frank Scully and does some fact checking on it which further aligns with the contents in this MJ12 doc. Assuming the crash was real, we need to establish precedent that the government reverse engineered technology from the crash. There is significant evidence that Mark McCandlish has put forth which shows that by the 50s the U.S. government had reverse engineered a flying saucer craft and published blueprints under the name &quot;Alien Reproduction Vehicle&quot; (see <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IW6LX9W_ahI">here</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4yhE1l0CcY">here</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_gravity_control_propulsion_research">here</a>). </p>

<p>If we can establish that the government reverse engineered a flying saucer craft, then I want to further analyze the information which suggests that John Von Neumann was involved in the reverse engineering process and his work on the craft is what led to breakthroughs in computing. </p>

<h1>John Von Neumann</h1>

<p>It is alleged in the document that Von Neumann was an influential scientist involved in the Aztec crash and his involvement led to further understanding of the binary computing language. I did some digging and the public evidence for this claim is not overwhelming but I do want to point out one thing which is interesting considering Von Nuemann&#39;s contributions to numerous scientific fields. He developed the concept of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_computing">Stochastic Computing</a> in 1953, 6 supposed years after the Aztec crash. I think this is significant because Stochastic Computing was years beyond the computational capacities of computers at the time and essentially uses the idea of probability to perform mathematical computations on a series of bits (Bernoulli processes). I think this has some interesting implications because we are now finding Stochastic Computing to be increasingly influential in the field of machine learning (self replicating code as well). Von Neumann is known for proposing the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-replicating_spacecraft">Self Replicating Spaceprobe</a> as well as designing the first <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/when-did-the-term-compute/">computer virus</a> implying that he saw benefit in self replicating and self regulating computer programs and more specifically a universal Turing machine. This would support the statements put forth in the MJ12 document. I think this is a hard claim to research, but I thought I would include it for posterity.</p>

<h1>Conclusion</h1>

<p>I think there is more than enough evidence to suggest that both Tesla and Marconi received signals that to them implied a non terrestial origin and both stories align with the supposedly real MJ12 document which was just recently released. At the very least both Tesla and Marconi were receiving signals that could not be explained by natural occurring phenomena, and if Tesla had the capability to transmit at the distance he claimed, then the idea that ETI would be alerted due to that signal is not that far fetched. It is also not a stretch to state that scientists such as Von Neumann may have produced valuable research from the reverse engineering of the Alien craft and this information led to the great advances in computing, quantum mechanics, and understanding the human Genome. Furthermore, it appears that at first glance the majority of information in the MJ12 document fits with established history and appears to either be a well fabricated hoax, or an authentic document with some crazy implications attached.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, that paper only analyzed the public data of Tesla&#39;s radio signals (since the government obtained all of his documents and only just now declassified them) and has absolutely no mention of Marconi&#39;s signals anywhere in that paper. Maybe if you took the time to read the rest of the post you would see there is a lot more information.</p>

<p>No, it has.</p>
