        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Yes the research that is done on this subreddit is important but I wanted to share a simple reminder as it can be easy to get lost in the thick of it all. </p>

<p>Go to your nearest hiking trail. Smell the air. Look at the trees. Marvel at its beauty. The branches, the leaves, the sun gleaming through the small pockets of space. </p>

<p>Look at the trunk, strong and mighty leading to the roots that tangle in unpredictable patterns into the ground. Take off your shoes. Then your socks. Feel the dirt beneath your feet. Feel the sensations as the electricity stored up in your body is released from wearing rubber soled shoes all day. Feel it as it is released straight into the ground. You should feel a tingle. Dig your toes into the ground a little. </p>

<p>Stretch out your hands as if they were antennas, receiving the blessings of the trees. Close your eyes. Feel a breeze wash over you. Love the nature that is around you. It is you. Don&#39;t try to love it. Just be love itself. Take a deep breath through your nose. Hear the rustle of leaves. Or if there is no wind, listen to the silence that perpetuates itself throughout the forest. The occasionally bird chirping. </p>

<p>This is what you&#39;re fighting for. </p>

<p>This is why you spend your time on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>. You can argue that its for entertainment or to waste time but deep inside, you have come here to find something. Freedom. Love. Life. Truth. </p>

<p>The trees are you. You are the tree. Everyone around us. We are one. TPTB, they are one with us. They are hurting. They do not know. Forgive them for they do not know what they do. The healing process begins now. It begins with ourselves. When we reach out to all the parts of ourselves that we have neglected and hated, and we welcome those parts back with love and open arms. We welcome back the parts of ourselves that we feared nobody else would appreciate or love and say, &quot;Hey come back here, I love you man. I love everything about you. Oh how I delight in your perfection.&quot; </p>

<p>And then we can do the same for others. I love you. I&#39;m here for you in spirit. This is not an illusion for me. Love is not an illusion or a chemical reaction. Love is not bounded by biology. Love is not bounded by boundaries. Love has no limit.</p>

<p>Love is kind, patient, forgiving, infinite, and giving. It instills hopes and dreams. It helps us find truth that we are desperately looking for in this subreddit. It was within us the entire time. </p>

<p>Love is like the tree. Its branches may change directions, its leaves may change colors, parts of it dies, new parts grow, but the roots remain the same and grow only deeper.</p>

<p>Godspeed <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hah nature? Come on, shill! Why would I ever want to be connected to the planet like that? That&#39;s, like, what the government wants, man. I&#39;m not gonna &#39;feed into the system&#39; by stepping away from my stuff. I paid a lot of money for this shit. </p>

<p>What am I, a sheep? Like a sheep that literally lives outside in a pasture? I&#39;m not one of those &quot;sheeples.&quot; I never even got that metaphor until now though, bro. </p>

<p>People are always telling me stupid shit &quot;look inside&quot; and I&#39;m like &#39;I am inside. This is my house, dude.&#39; My friend is always telling me to, like, &quot;find the light&quot; and I&#39;m like &#39;dude I&#39;m not blind the light switches are on the wall.&#39; I feel like I never know what he&#39;s talking about. </p>

<p>I mean, yeah I smash chicks and crush beers Saturdays with the boys (Saturdays are for the boys) like every weekend, but I&#39;m fucking woke, bro. And I&#39;ll fight you if you don&#39;t believe me. </p>

<p>My church took me to Egypt one time and we saw the Pyramids. The teacher was like &quot;check this big shit out&quot; and I was like &quot;yeah, it&#39;s a buncha rocks, so what&quot; and he&#39;s like &quot;how did this all get here exactly like that&quot; and I&#39;m like &quot;PEOPLE DRAGGED IT DUH DUMBSHIT.&quot; The weed was flame tho. </p>

<p>Anyway, don&#39;t fuckin tell me to go out into nature because I don&#39;t take shit from the man, man. I&#39;m a fuckin rebel. Like Han Soho from Star Trek or whatever the nerd thing is. So yeah. Fuck the system. </p>
