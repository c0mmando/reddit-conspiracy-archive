       I haven't heard anyone say it's fake. How many additional self-posts do we need of this in r/conspiracy today anyway? Are you adding anything new?
      </p>
      <p>
       At the risk of repeating, here's my comments on this topic in one of the many other posts:
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       It's already pretty obvious that partisan James O'Keefe who makes these videos under the funding of the super mysterious Republican Dark Money group Donors' Trust, and who has received money directly from the Donald Trump campaign -- that this highly edited video is about the same quality as anything else he has ever put out -- including the pathetic fake Acorn video and the Planned Parenthood video.
      </p>
      <p>
       But we can assess this video on its own:
      </p>
      <p>
       James O'Keefe has been working for many years to "expose" CNN -- spending who knows how many thousands of hours and hundreds of thousands of dollars and the best he could do is find this one guy who appears to be a Trumpster receiving a paycheck from CNN?
      </p>
      <p>
       We don't even know, thanks to the edits, just how much the "undercover" punk pushed him to agree -- obviously more than a little as we can hear that on the video.
      </p>
      <p>
       If anything, and despite the corporate bias of CNN, this video proves that they do not require ideological tests for their workers. I'll bet Breitbart, the Mercer oligarchic and official state media, can't say that. Certainly not Fox News. :)

       Why should they? If I spent all my time dealing with the "substance" of known discredited sources, I wouldn't do anything else. I made a special exception just for you. :)

       Apparently you are, one of CNN's own producers thinks they are broadcasting a fake story and witch hunting Trump in the name of ratings and the only thing you can talk about is attacking the person that released the videos...

       This was implicit in my initial comment. Are you just figuring that out now? I'm glad we agree on this point.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's where we disagree. You are pushing an overarching narrative about CNN based upon, as I said, "one guy who appears to be a Trumpster." I am saying that is no indictment. Where I work, there's a Trumpster too. So what? :P

       This is true. It's not the best setting for a soap opera and it's dividing people even further.
      </p>
      <p>
       My only hope is that it encourages more citizens to get involved in politics and hold our government more accountable to representing the people of this country. I think both sides could agree that our government needs some improvement and educating the masses to what is actually going on in Washington is a good thing.

       I'm happy to talk about the content of the video. Some guy who works at CNN Health said that CNN talks a lot about the Russia Trump investigation because it's great for ratings. Holy shit really? I doubt that Fox news would ever report on Obama if he was being criminally investigated by the FBI. Especially not for the ratings!
      </p>
      <p>
       Then this guy is repeatedly asked if the story is mostly bullshit. He then says it "could be" because we don't have all that much information about how the investigation is going. So this one guy who works at CNN doesn't believe it's a big story and CNN is talking a lot about it because it's good for ratings. No fuckin way bro! This is supposed to be some earth shattering story?

       This is hilarious. The last dying gasp of a reactionary regime. Pure Republican propaganda that means nothing but trying to crush those who don't perfectly comply with the Republican Oligarchy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fact one: James O'Keefe is paid six figures a year by Republican oligarchs to make deceptive videos to discredit political "enemies" and specifically by the Donald Trump campaign, the oligarch Robert Mercer and his outlet Breitbart, and the Koch brothers and their Donors' Trust Dark Money organization.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fact two: James O'Keefe's political "enemies" are Democrats and only Democrats or their supporters.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fact three: James O'Keefe got into legal trouble and political trouble for faking a video about Acorn and misleading people about Planned PArenthood.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fact four: James O'Keefe has been a highly paid political infiltrator of CNN for years now.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fact five: Donald Trump supporters consist of a large pluraity of the population -- possibly as many as one in three.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fact six: CNN is a large company with thousands of employees.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fact seven: given probability and enough time, James O'Keefe was bound to find a Donald Trump supporter working at CNN.
      </p>
      <p>
       NOTHINGBURGER.
      </p>
      <p>
       And what are we supposed to learn from this? We are supposed to learn something we already know -- that CNN is bad. One great form of propaganda is to deliver something to "prove" their beliefs -- then to use that to distract from reality.
      </p>
      <p>
       Reality is:
      </p>
      <p>
       James O'Keefe supports the Current Government in Power -- something that we haven't seen here at Conspiracy until recently. James O'Keefe masks his well-paid support for Republicans in scandal and subterfuge. The
       <em>
        real
       </em>
       reason that James O'Keefe supports Republicans (aside from his six figure paycheck) is because he wants MORE REPUBLICAN POLICIES.
      </p>
      <p>
       And that's what is missing from these games of finger-pointing and corruption ...
      </p>
      <p>
       Republican policy is to end Medicare, Medicaid, all regulation, sell of the United States to unaccountable oligarchs, fully privatize and monopolize the internet, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       In other words, Republicans want to take us back to the societal structure of the 1800's. This is the end game.

       O'Keeffe has never released a honest video in his entire career. It's why he has detached his name from all his videos. The dude hires actors and it's well known.
