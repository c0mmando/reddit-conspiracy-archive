       To all flatearthers, your conspiracy is terrible.
You claim gravity doesn't exist, yet when you jump, you go down again.
Gravity can easily be proven with gravitational acceleration, say if you have an air ballon, and you want it to fly leveled well, then you can do the maths the ballon is 450m
       <sup>
        3
       </sup>
       the density of the air outside of it is 1,15kg/m
       <sup>
        3
       </sup>
       If you put hot air inside of the ballon, with a density of 0,70kg/m
       <sup>
        3
       </sup>
       then the air ballon will fly, and if you want it leveled 
you then say 450x1,15=517,5kg, you then use the gravitational acceleration and say 517,5x9,82=5081,85 N
and if the hot air was in it would be
450x0,7=315kg
315x9,82=3093,3 N
then you say 5081,85 - 3093,3=1988,55N
1988,55N is what you need to keep it leveled 
1988,55/9,82=202,5 kg, so the basket and everything within it needs to weight 202,5 kg, and the air ballon will then be leveled.
Gravity confirmed

       Flat earth falls down when distance comes into it,using gravity can fail to get through because we only know the effects of gravity not exactly what it is.

       You're right, but a lot of these guys want schools to not teach about a globe, and if the schools don't do that, 5 generations from now will be retarded people who think that nasa and the jews have faked the moon landing, even the highest people in the world will think someone is faking and lying to them

       Schools are already indoctrinating kids to believe the controls systems version of events(more so where i live) &amp; until the education system teaches kids to think &amp; not be told,then your worries about flat earth are on a pretty large list.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now you bring in the moon landings....they have some serious anomalies that a thinking person should seriously look at.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look at it like this.....just because a flat earth researcher uses the banking control system in their video or post,does that mean the system is now bunk?
      </p>
      <p>
       But i hear you about the schools man,they always aim all their shit at the kids because they are the future!If your really worried about that then get active with your local school &amp; stop it at the root.

       You bring a bad name to conspiracy theories.
Thought control, meaning that teachers theach their 
ideology to students and keep telling them to become this and that, mening students can't choose them selfs.
However, in the very Orwellian 'Brick in the wall', the 'dark' is meant to convey a more cynical, sinister or particularly ill-intended sarcasm demonstrated by the the teachers; a particular pernicious sarcasm that poisons the minds of the pupils, or (as I think the song intends) the conditioning of the populace by the establishment/government machine. Not satan, not brain washing.
Just the goverment that wants as many students as possible to be more educatet

       'Space may be the final frontier
But it's made in a Hollywood basement
Cobain can you hear 'The Spheres'
Singing songs off
       <em>
        Station to Station
       </em>
       And Alderaan's not far away
It's Californication'

       Not two days ago I was having a look in a book, and I saw a picture of a guy fried up above his knees. I said, 'I can relate?' Cause lately I've been thinking of combustication as a welcomed vacation. From the burdens of the planet Earth like gravity, hypocrisy, and the perils of being in 3-D And thinking so much differently So pardon me while I burst into flames I've had enough of the world and it's people's mindless games. So pardon me while I burn and rise above the flame Pardon me, pardon me, I'll never be the same.

      <p>
       They are referencing Kurt Cobain, asking him if he can hear 'The Spheres' singing songs off
       <em>
        Station to Station
       </em>
       (which is a David Bowie album), Nirvana also covered Bowie ('Man Who Sold the World', probably being their most popular Bowie cover).
      </p>
      <p>
       'The Spheres' are actually 'The Foo Fighters' who also covered Bowie frequently, and even played with him live on a few occasions. (Feel free to Google all of this).
      </p>
      <p>
       Foo is a variable term (frequently used in programming), Foo, Foobar (essentially a placeholder name).
      </p>
      <p>
       Also in 1944, during WWII pilots reported seeing fast-moving round glowing objects (spheres) following their aircraft. These burning spheres were eventually dubbed 'Foo Fighters'
      </p>
      <p>
       'The Spheres' = 'The Sphere Fighters' = 'The Foo Fighters'

       "bubbles" can be explained. Do you think that the universe is a total shithole with nothing at all in it?
There is oxygen nitrogen and all other sorts of chemicals, 
Again, if these people fooled the whole world, do you think that they would fuck up this badly?
They must be masters of fooling, yet accidentaly there pops a waterbubble in front of the camera?
And, how do they flod? can't be because there is water, because 1 you can't see it, 2 they would drown.
Can't be in a plane, because at some point the plane has to fly upwards again, and you would hear the plane, AND they did a 24 hour stream.
No plane can fly for 24 hours

       I wonder why flat earth belivers haven't jumped on a plane, and flown to the underside of the flat earth. You could prove us pesky "ball-earthers" wrong with some nice video footage of the disk/underside.

      <blockquote>

       To which I said:

        NASA does lie, and ancient cultures did believe the Earth was flat.

      <p>
       And nothing more. I don't know if God, angels and demons exists, though compared to year ago (when I was still a baller!) I'm starting concider they actually might.

       <p>

      <p>
       That's just you making random claims. The atmosphere, obviously, exists, with all it's known mechanics and phenomena.
      </p>
      <blockquote>

        The whole flat earth argument dismisses science in the name of The Bible.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       It dismisses scientism, not the scientific method. A fair part of flat earthers (dare I say the large majority) are looking for physical (scientific) ways to measure the shape of the Earth.
      </p>
      <p>
       As opposed to the ball-earthers who just stick to text-book definition they've learned in highschool/uni, regardless if there's any actual science (experiments, measurements) to back it up.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The Earth is a sphere because I read so in my textbook, and scientists tell me it is.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       vs
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The Earth isn't a sphere because there's no experiments to conclusively proof it is. Yet there are -plenty- of experiments to prove it isn't a spinning sphere.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Again, I'm not a flat earther myself, more a globe-sceptic, but blind adherence to the globe-earth shows lack of research.

       Could be. I don't know if it's flat, concave or perhaps doesn't even have a physical shape at all (We're all just a hologram man, life's an illusion #newage).

       It's definitely not round though. I can back that claim by pointing to al the flat earth evidence that is presented. But you don't look at that, so nevermind.

       It isn't perfectly round but it is spherical and 'bulges out' at the equator. Seriously, read about the creation of stars and planets. The evidence of the earth having a curviture is all around us. Go meteorite hunting. The ones coming into the atmosphere curves. Watch the stars throughout the years, you can literally tell where abouts we are in the universe because the Earth is a globe, so southern and northern hemispheres star viewability alters throughout the year. It can all be seen through your own eyes. The Earth is not flipping flat lol

       there's several glaring issues with our ball Earth which aren't proporly being adressed.

       There's alot more people in the same boat as us (true sceptics, not globe believers), and that's exactly what they (the illoeminaties) don't want the general population to see.

       That's where shilling on
       <strong>
        every

       don't want us looking there. My take-away from this is that out of all conspiracies, this is one they're especially affraid off.

       If gravity exists, flat earths can't.
Gravity pulls everything to the middle, which means that the earth would brake, and if you where to go further away from the core, say south america, the the gravity would be way higher, meaning you could feel it. vsauce made a great video about it titled "What if the earth was flat"

       Gravity pulls everything to the middle according to globe Earth theory.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's no physical experiments to prove any of this (because the scale is so large), and thus it's all
       <strong>
        theory
       </strong>
       , as admitted by science itself when you read the small letters.
      </p>
      <p>
       So to base the assumption
       <em>
        it can't be flat
       </em>
       the current theorical, unproven (and incorrect) model of our universe seems a bit naive. You're essentially saying it can't be flat because
       <em>
        science says so
       </em>
       .
      </p>

       U can't back it up with anything other than that, because
       <em>

       your entire arguement is based on theory.

       well fine, if that arguement isen't enough.
The sun is round, the moon is round, i made another post about how they must be 384400 and 143900000 km away.
every single object in the universe is round, stars etc. and if they're not, then they are all pointing towards us.
Thats kind of dumb isn't it?
The stars in the southern hempistfere are not the same as the north, meaning australia see different stars from f.x Denmark.
So stars also disprove this idiocy

       This is the thing that always gets me that people have trouble grasping.  They'll go on about gravity when gravity has never been proven as a property of mass.  They'll say we can measure distances to planets and stars using parallax when parallax is wholly dependent on the Copernican model.  They don't grasp that the mathematics can be correct while the underlying presumptions are false.  The whole model is unproven theories built upon unproven theories.
      </p>
      <p>
       The observations of objects falling towards earth and the movements of celestial bodies have always been known, it's only the "why" or "how" that's been unanswered.  The modern theories were developed over centuries of people inventing answers to these to make their model fit the mathematics and patterns that were well known.  Flat earth theory fits the observations just as well but people are too married to the model to accept it as circumstantial.
      </p>
      <p>
       Eventually it always comes down to "we have pictures" because there is no other hard evidence they can give for the globe.  Even then, the pictures cannot be above scrutiny and how can we really determine whether they're real?  It all boils down to whether you place your faith in NASA and the other space agencies.

       That's not what he's saying.
      </p>
      <p>
       The motion of gravity described by an incredibly simple formula accurately describes how the apple will fall down to any precision you can measure. That formula
       <strong>
        requires
       </strong>
       Earth to be an oblate spheroid.
      </p>
      <p>
       If an FE theory had a formula that was at least as accurate, they'd have an argument. If they had a formula that was
       <em>
        better
       </em>
       (predicted some measurement better than the ones we accept) then they'd have an actual scientific theory.
      </p>
      <p>
       So far, I've seen nothing. Most crackpot science theories go overboard with convoluted math that takes ages to unravel and debunk. Flat Earthers, as far as I've seen, completely reject the idea behind math and physics in favor of magic and religion.

       Actually, that formula (F=m.g)
       <strong>
        doesn't
       </strong>
       require the Earth to be an oblate spheroid. There's simply a downward force (to the surface of the Earth) of 9/81 m/s
       <sup>
        2,
       </sup>
       on both flat and spherical Earth.

      <p>
       It's also
       <strong>
        wrong
       </strong>
       for the spherical Earth, because our current understanding of gravity has
       <strong>
        severe issues
       </strong>
       on larger scales. Einstein, and pretty much every well-bred scientists, will agree on this.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm pretty sure even Neil Degrasse Thyson himself said somewhere we've got no fucking clue what gravity is. The reason why is because we can explain what gravity does
       <strong>
        here on Earth
       </strong>
       using simply formulas, yet we can't explain jack shit when it comes to deep-space. (motion of galaxies etc)
      </p>
      <p>
       That's why scientism has to invent shit like dark matter, energy and other exotic stuff. Just to make the model work.

       F=mg is a specific case of the general gravity formula. On a flat earth, that formula would lead to very different results the further away you were from the center. Results that don't match our experience.
      </p>
      <p>
       That we don't know what gravity is is an oversimplification of our understanding. We don't know what
       <em>
        anything
       </em>
       is, but our theories explain observation to a degree greater than anything else.
      </p>
      <p>
       Dark matter and dark energy aren't marks against General Relativity but rather evidence of how well the scientific method works. When experiment doesn't match the models, we look deeper and gain a truer understanding of the universe. Most times we find that the underlying truth is even more elegant than we imagined before, but other times it's more complex.
      </p>
      <p>
       One of the Crown Jewels of General Relativity is explaining the precession of Mercury's perihelion.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here we have a formula that models the universe as a curved space-time- a geometrical construct that consists of extremely simple formulae and yet it mathematically describes a tiny anomaly that Newton's equations can't.
      </p>
      <p>
       If GR
       <em>
        isn't
       </em>
       correct (or an approximation of correct - like Newton's equations are to GR) it would be like fitting a line to a set of random points and then finding out that fit described the birth dates, ages and weights of all 19 9/11 hijackers.
      </p>
      <p>
       And that's just one of dozens of things that GR predicts to perfect precision. And GR does absolutely require Earth to be round.

       You're talking about measurements at a scale that didn't exist when GR was formulated. Those are requiring us to examine the theory and expand it - or toss it and replace with something better, that's how science works. But it can only be replaced by something that explains everything that GR already explains.
      </p>
      <p>
       But there are measurements at our scale that you
       <em>
        can
       </em>
       measure that have only ever been explained by GR. How do
       <strong>
        you
       </strong>
       explain the precession of Mercury's perihelion? It's measurable, it's not at some cosmic or atomic scale out of your reach. All you need is a telescope and some patience. Only GR has ever been able to explain it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Quantum Mechanics can also be observed and tested at our scale. The thing you're typing on right now... that couldn't work if QM was wrong. The very concept of solid-state transistors (and thus microchips) is QM dependent.

       I also wouldn't say computers (electronics) require quantum mechanics to work, they don't. Solid state (including ram) devices do, due to the dualistic nature of electrons (wave/matter), but it's on the edge between classical science and quantum mechanics.
      </p>
      <p>
       A quantum computer would require actual quantum mechanics, and it's also why they call current computers "classical" computers.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also never said QM wasn't real, I said it's a theory. I believe you can "keep zooming" into things to get to a smaller and smaller scale, with the hypothised Planck length being the smallest unit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Clearly, electricity exists, and I see little reason to dismiss everything I know about electrons (their flow, ...) because it's not related to the flat/round earth debate.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not
       <strong>
        all
       </strong>
       of science is wrong, just certain parts. (Astronomy being the prime example) Most things related to the extremely small scales (QM) are compabitable with the flat earth. As a matter of fact, they make
       <strong>
        more sense
       </strong>
       on a flat Earth than they do on a round Earth.

       How am I ignoring them? I've said they're a great example of science at work. Finding data that doesn't fit a theory doesn't make a theory garbage. Especially when there are no other theories that explain what it

       It'd be one thing if Einstein formulated GR specifically to explain Mercury's motion. But he didn't - it's nowhere near the focus of his math or logic. And yet, there it is. How could it have possibly accidentally explained this anomaly
       <strong>
        perfectly
       </strong>
       ? Name one discredited or fringe theory that has ever accidentally explained or predicted something that it wasn't designed to do.

       Every bit of the foundations of QM are required for solid state electronics to work - Wave/particle duality, Pauli exclusion, Fermi states... if any one of those things was even a different from the formulations we know, those chips working would be the greatest coincidental accident of human history. You'd have a greater chance of throwing some mud and sticks in a blender and having a human baby come out than you would of molding some silicon based on an incorrect theory and ending up with a working microprocessor.

       I don't expect anyone to believe me, or the flat earth. You can verify all this yourself, I do myself most of the time. I've seen
       <strong>
        so

       much shit over the years, it's hard to keep track of what is

       information and what isn't. -to use in my hypothesis-
      </p>
      <p>
       If you currently hold the belief we
       <strong>
        must
       </strong>
       live on a ball and it absolutely can't be flat because satelites and pilots and surveyors and architects and spacy agencies and science and  guardians of the galaxy and shit, all that stuff has satisfiable anwsers within the theory (to me anyways).
      </p>
      <p>
       This should be on everyone's mind, just so the ball gets rolling. Call out NASA (and the other agencies) for the bullshit they pulled (A genuine roast, full disclosure moon landings, operation fishbowl, etc). After that we can start
       <em>
        officially
       </em>
       investigate what the shape of the Earth is, though I have a hunch as to what the anwser is going to be.

       It would also be cool if we could raise funds to globally build and test rectilineators. Use current-day technology (and technique) to try and perfect the level, and see the results. Shit like that woud be kinda awesome.

       See I'm with you on the fact that you have no idea what the Earth actually is.
      </p>
      <p>
       Im not sure I can believe earth is Flat either. The idea of like a disc spinning in what's suppose to be outer space just looks weird to me based on what I've been taught and shown in school.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, evidence given by people who believe in Flat Earth and support it, are hard to ignore. What I can see for myself and others as well is also hard to ignore. Watching videos of weather balloons reaching the sky and still seeing the horizon be flat is not something I can just pretend is something that's suppose to be a ball.
      </p>
      <p>
       My thought process is, both sides have some form of truth. But both sides have people that are totally ignorant and just keep spouting nonsense about how the other side is lying and ignorant and they need to go read a book or do more research, without providing their own findings, evidence, and questions that have yet to be answered.
      </p>
      <p>
       A few of my questions are findings from my boyfriend. Like when you take a time-lapse of the night sky, why are the stars spinning in what looks to be a perfect circle if we are spinning around the sun, which happens to be hurtling through space a several thousand miles per hour?
      </p>
      <p>
       Or why is it that the same math used to prove the earth is round and so many miles large, also proves that the earth is NOT round. Based on how many miles long a horizon is, there should be a certain percentage of a curvature that people have yet to see.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thanks for sharing all your knowledge and findings though. Really appreciate it!

       According to 'flat earth logic' NASA lies and ancient cultures believed in flat earth therefore the Earth is flat. It's a fucking religious theory and thought that is being pushed on all of us.

       If gravity exists, flat earths can't.
Gravity pulls everything to the middle, which means that the earth would brake, and if you where to go further away from the core, say south america, the the gravity would be way higher, meaning you could feel it. vsauce made a great video about it titled "What if the earth was flat"

       That's not what he's saying.
      </p>
      <p>
       The motion of gravity described by an incredibly simple formula accurately describes how the apple will fall down to any precision you can measure. That formula
       <strong>
        requires
       </strong>
       Earth to be an oblate spheroid.
      </p>
      <p>
       If an FE theory had a formula that was at least as accurate, they'd have an argument. If they had a formula that was
       <em>
        better
       </em>
       (predicted some measurement better than the ones we accept) then they'd have an actual scientific theory.
      </p>
      <p>
       So far, I've seen nothing. Most crackpot science theories go overboard with convoluted math that takes ages to unravel and debunk. Flat Earthers, as far as I've seen, completely reject the idea behind math and physics in favor of magic and religion.

       They still refuse to believe you even with such evidence to back you in your findings. Kinda sounds like a religion to me.
