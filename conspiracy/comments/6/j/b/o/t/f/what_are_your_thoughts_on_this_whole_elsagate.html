<p>There seems to be a network of youtube channels and they upvote and comment on each others videos, correct?  TBH I can&#39;t watch too many of these videos, they give me the creeps.</p>

They&#39;re SO borderline for the most part that you might not think you were seeing anything weird even if you looked at the video. Mostly it&#39;s more like, why are there 50 videos set to the same &quot;finger family&quot; song, that consist of someone squishing food into a carpet with their hands?

    <div class="md"><p>Obligatory comment I give out to people who recently discovered this and are digging deep into this rabbit hole:</p>

<p>&quot;Friendly reminder to those who like digging deep, make sure to step away from it every so often. The amount of disgusting, absurd things you will find down this rabbit hole is overwhelming. There are &quot;kid videos&quot; ranging from insanely inappropriate cartoons to actual live children being exploited.  The shit WILL make you nauseous and you will need to take breaks if you are a normal, sane person.&quot;</p>

<p>With that out of the way, yeah this is a big fucking deal.  It is deliberately targeting kids, and unassuming / uninvolved parents are just clicking whatever seemingly kid-friendly video comes up and letting that shit autoplay into the next related video.  As you click the videos in the related section, you get into seriously dark themes like severing limbs, using needles to inject things into a child&#39;s butt, dealing with pregnancy, etc.  </p>

<p>This issue is not only with YouTube, but also has to do with semi-lazy parenting techniques.  Speaking from experience, I have seen far too many parents resort to giving a child a phone or iPad just to keep them occupied and not causing havoc in the household.  A couple I used to be friends with would just type child cartoon videos (or something to that extent) into the search bar, click the first video, and let that shit run its course while they went off to do chores and such.  The videos the child is watching being completely unmonitored.  This is dangerous, and we need to spread awareness other parents that they absolutely need to be more involved in their child&#39;s day to day activities. </p>

<p>This is going to be a multi-front war.  YouTube needs to be held accountable for hosting this content and ignoring all the reports those videos are generating.  The users that upload these videos need to go to fucking jail (or some or them at least).  And lastly, the parents are also to blame for not giving enough of a shit to make sure the videos their child watches are kosher.  </p>
