       Judaism is Satanism.  It is not the religion of the Old Testament or the ancient Israelites.  Judaism is a perversion of the Old Testament, bringing in occult/Babylonian doctrines that take preeminence.  The most authoritative book in Judaism is the Babylonian Talmud, a book of occult/Satanic doctrines. Kaballah is another system of jewish occult/Satanic teachings.
      </p>
      <p>
       The people calling themselves "jews" are not the real descendants of the Israelites.   They actually descend from the Khazars, Edomites (Esau), and Canaanites.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Messiah referred to these Edomite "jews" as "of their father the devil" (John 8:44), "children of hell" (Matthew 23:15), and a "synagogue of Satan" (Revelation 2:9).

       Uh, they didn't kill Jesus... there also hasn't really ever been any major Christian/Jewish wars anywhere... and they're bankers because in medival times the Christians weren't allowed to bank and the Jews weren't allowed to do anything much besides bank so they became bankers and controlled money and historically whenever the common people are upset, it's usually those with money whether bankers of monarchy.

       Yes, they did.  The jews are not the real descendants of the Israelites.  At the time of the Messiah, there were multiple ethnic groups in the land of Judea -- including real Israelites, Samaritans, Canaanites, and Edomites (descendants of Esau and Canaanites).
      </p>
      <p>
       The jewish Pharisees were mostly ethnic Edomites.  The scriptures are quite clear that the Pharisees and jews were the ones who were responsible for murdering the Messiah.

       No the scripture is pretty clear that the Romans killed Jesus, Romans who worship Roman gods. You could argue that the Jews sentenced Jesus to death by not voting him out of jail and instead that other guy but Pontius Pilate was a Roman. And they killed him by crucification which is definitely a Roman way, if they Jews did it, it would've been by stoning. Additionally a lot of Jews at this point already disliked Jesus because he was proclaiming himself to be the Messiah which a lot of people didn't believe, by the time of Jesus resurrection the religions were all but separated.

       It's strange to me that we still don't agree on who killed Jesus. Sarah Silverman claims the Jews killed Jesus, and she would gladly do it again. I never found her funny, but she is Jewish and she certainly thinks the Jews killed Jesus.

       False.  The Pharisees/jews were the ones who orchestrated the murder of the Messiah, and used the Romans to carry it out.  The Messiah was initially apprehended by servants of the high priest (of the jewish Sanhedrin), assured by the Pharisees, and then taken to Pilate.  Then when Pilate found no fault in the Messiah, he asked the jewish crowd to release him, but the jews insisted that the Messiah be crucified.

       His crimes were blasphemy. Those weren't just "trumped up" he on multiple occasions basically told the priests to go fuck themselves. He flipped that table in the temple and he fraternized with all the low life of the city, the sinners who if you're a Jew there is no real way to repent. He pushed the idea that even thinking about sinning shouldn't happen where in judism it only the action that matters. He said that he spoke to god and didn't he say that he was the son of god? I'm a little fuzzy on my scripture. He was a revolutionary in many ways who according to Jewish law should be stoned to death. I guess you're right in that the Jews just orchestrated his death and used the Romans, but he very much should've been killed. Him coming back was just weird.

       It's very much not satanism. They worship the same god as both Islam and Christianity. For the most part most Jews share most core beliefs as most Christians. The only real difference that I'm going to say is through both is that Christin's believe in thought sin where Jews don't.

       Islam and Judaism both worship the same god, yes.  Satan.  The true religion of "Christiantiy" (of the Israelites) worships the Creator, not Satan.

       The Messiah was an Israelites.  Not a jew.  The people calling themselves "jews", including the Pharisees at that time, were descendants of the Edomites.  The jews are not racial Israelites.

       In their book they claim to be a race. One superior and favored compared to all others even. Also race does have correlate with religious believe. Santeria being a great example having originated among the caribbean peoples. Even though it is practiced by many now in the day it was only blacks/caribbean people practicing it.

       Favorite moments? For me some of the best are them funding both sides of the Napoleonic wars, overthrowing the Tsars, creating nuclear weapons, creating the federal reserve, opening the gates of Toledo to invading Muslims, and putting us in Vietnam + Iraq.

       Not really, it's that in the middle ages they were pretty much banned from doing any real jobs so they became bankers and had their own ghettos in cities, making them rich and outsiders. And therefore an easy scapegoat, and then they get expelled and brought back and so it goes until present day.

       The most I can find is that because Christians couldn't be bankers and Jews could be. But there's also a theory that they just moved to more skilled work in cities like banking because Jews are required to be able to read the Torah so they can more easily become bankers and such because they're literate.

       First the Sephardic Jews went from Spain to Amsterdam, where they used exploitive, predatory lending to create a market. Then they had the Monarchs send European gentiles out to enslave blacks, which they then sold in the Jewish markets. Europeans have been blamed for slavery, when in fact whites have been enslaving whites for millennia. The very word Slave comes from Slav.

       First of all, Spanish Jews were expelled (conveniently) and went to Venice where they were  welcomed by the Venetian/Roman Bankers (
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Medici">
        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Medici
       </a>
       ), who created the modern banking system. The Jews were
       <em>
        working for
       </em>
       the Venetians, because publicly, Christians could not commit usury. But, that was all a front/ploy/loophole to hide where the true power lays, which is the Holy Roman Empire - Vatican.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's laughable to think the oldest Corporation in the world (Vatican) would not commit usury because it was "sinful". They don't give a shit about Christianity, and there are theories that they The Roman Empire created it via the Piso-Flavian dynasty. They down right allowed people to pay to get into heaven. As I've said below:

        History is far from being black or white. All races, religions, creeds have done fucked up shit throughout history. None excluded.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Khazars work for Rome, and have been for thousands of years. Those are the fake Jews. They're not Jewish, they hide behind that and they and the Roman Empire profits. While unwitting Jews get fucked like the rest of us.

       Permanent Jewish life in Amsterdam began with the arrival of pockets of Marrano and Sephardic Jews at the end of the 15th, and beginning of the 16th century. Many Sephardii (so-called Spanish Jews) had been expelled from Spain and Portugal in 1492 after the fall of Muslim Granada. The first chief rabbi was Rabbi Uri Levi. [From this wiki article.](

       Whenever someone comments about how I delete my history, I know that they were checking out my history. So then I check out their history, cause it makes me wonder why they want to check out my history. They probably figure because I make one post about the Jews, that I must be some frequent visitor to the DailyStormer, and have a confederate flag on my pick-up truck right next to my fully automatic submachine gun or some other crazy idea.

       why not just inquire within the thread? I mean, not every post in a person's history is going to be related to the one post that made you want to search someones history. Maybe they have a well-balanced Reddit life and spend their days on multiple subs, like Pokemon, Apple, LOTR, Television, etc? Unless you are looking for a reason to discredit their post based on some form of 'evidence' you may find in their history. Maybe if they commented about something else you found unsavoury you could use this to delegitimize their argument?

       Fortunately you can just google a reddit username and hypothetically use something like uneddit to gain that same context, and sometimes (definitely NOT this particular case) that context shows a somewhat fascinating form of insanity, with a blend of nerdy fanboyism, technical illiteracy, but also bizarre cryto-historical theories involving Saturn, Nimrod, Ba'al etc, which they use in part to justify a pervasive strain of pure bigotry that you see in posts like this.

       Because they're an easy minority to blame problems on and expel with no reprecussion? Oh wait you probably want the anti-Semitic answer, because they eat babies.

       And usury banking enslavement.  And promoting dengeneracy in everything they control (e.g., Hollywood, porn industry).  And murdering the Messiah and warring against Christianity ever since.  And controlling Western governments.  And fomenting almost all wars over the last few centuries in order to mass murder the "goyim" and making obscene profits via banking/debt.
