       Six million Jews, were they gassed by the National Socialists? I am undecided. There is no doubt that many Jews were killed during the war, but an elaborate plan to exterminate them systematically through the use of gas chambers? Hmm.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why bother  trasnporting them, clothing them, feeding them, fighting disease, have on-camp hospitals, have leisurely activities etc if they were just going to kill them? Germany was in a huge state of chaos, all funds were directed to the war effort. Why on earth would they divert so much manpower and cash to something like this?
      </p>
      <p>
       These are all questions, of course. And not necessarily counter-arguments. As for empirical evidence, what is there? Most of the camps were rebuilt by Soviet forces as "replicas". We know gas was used to delouse inmate clothing. But there are no documents to show evidence of homicide via gassing, there are no blueprints of gas chambers.
      </p>
      <p>
       As someone on the fence, I am looking for an objective debate based on factual evidence. Let me know what you think.

       David Irving has done some excellent research on the subject. He claims that there was some gassing of Jews at three concentration camps (one of them being Treblinka). And there were a couple of thousand of Jews who were gassed at Auschwitz in the "White Room" during the early part of the war. But, Irving claims Hitler ordered all gassing of Jews to be halted immediately, and anybody disobeying his orders would be shot.

       Source? I also find it hard to believe, late war Germany who had a major Labour and fuel shortage could at all be able to kill thousands of potential laborers and waste huge amounts of fuel burning buddies to ash which even today would be a difficult task.

       I dunno, I haven't heard of that before, but I have seen the so called evidence of the holocaust get debunked, such as Jew soap, skin lamps and shrunken heads. Aushowitz also passes tons of hair and clothes as evidence as murders, which of course there would be such items because of the lice epidemics. But that garden sounds interesting.

       only around a million jews died in WWII but it was due to the crisis of the country and not because Hitler gave a "final order" there was never such thing.

       It would seem to me that your problem with the holocaust supposedly not having happened would be that it should have.

       Remember when you said this?

       "anti-semitism has to become mainstream. EVERYONE in the world needs to see the jews as a plague"
      </p>

       "People have to do the same thing Hitler did by making the nation more aware of It's own ethnic identity"

       Well, the important thing is that you both found a way to feel superior. Good job. I would say to pat yourselves on the back but what you guys are doing looks more... intimate. That is a very graceful stroke you have,

       You see people alternatingly expressing a deep care for the fact that they were lied to over the course of their entire lifetime, making them question the very tenets of their education, and you call them nazi sympathizers. WTF is wrong with you?

       haha your bias blinds you. Go ahead and pick and choose your way to your world-view. Leave out the stuff that doesn't support your emotional reaction. I won't stop you, but that doesn't change the already-existing words that describe your behavior.

       Yeah, totally. You are again picking and choosing what suits your reaction. That's what a bias is. I mean I could tell you what an honest and unbiased takeaway would be, but I'm pretty sure you hate me for being here, so it would probably be best if I do it like I'm doing it.

       I generally do not comment on politics,religion or the holocaust, too many sensitive user to openly discuss. But in my opinion it's all one sided , we don't and will never know what really happened all we can do is make speculations based on the little evidence presented as it's presented to go against the official stories . A really good question to ask thin air is who suffered more Jews , Native Americans, Blacks etc ? Its pretty ridiculous when you think about it , and what roll each play in the political arena. Just a though

       the 6 million number was used many times before the so called event. in actuality about 280,000 people died of typhoid. no gas was ever used on humans. many of the dead were gypsies and christians btw.

       and sadly his video is banned in many countries. what have people been doing for the last 75 years? how did it come to this? this is absolutely absurd. humanity let themselves be enslaved by a group of fakes. these people have zero connection to their stolen "homeland". they were thrown out of 109 countries because of molestation, human sacrifice and cannibalism. yet they now run the world and people salute them. this planet is literally an embarrassment at this point...

       The Holy Roman Empire (or the entities behind it - Black Nobility et al) did it in order to create Israel (securing the Holy Lands for them), where they will rule from, once The Holy See in Italy is false flagged. Self fulfilling prophecy. Hitler was a unwitting or witting pawn of Rome, via Jesuits.

       Indeed. Truth is stranger than fiction. As for them, I believe their beliefs go back to Sumeria as well as the bloodlines. I don't like to use the word Luciferian, because of it's connotation with Abrahamic religions, but yes... They are dark occultists of Dark Majick, imo. They worship and conjure lower level astral entities.

       Who knows about the exact number. It was a lot of people. The figure 6 million, was approx total deaths, not just deaths from gas chambers.

       nazis wanted free labor, bank information, gold teeth, intel on others, human experimentation. Literally anything nazi's could get from prisoners. Prisoners didn't get leisure time, outside of eating and sleeping the bare minimum. It was worth the cost in logistics. The trains for example were hauling supplies and wounded already. Free prison labor was just another supply.

       Genocide isn't just about killing. It's about extracting every last drop of every kind of wealth from a group of people. You get more from people the longer they're alive.
      </p>
      <p>
       Genocide happens. It gets covered up and down-played all time. The holocaust is no different.
      </p>
      <p>
       Asking if a particular genocide is real, or happened, is part of the cover up process. You are inadvertently helping the cause of genocidal maniacs everywhere.
      </p>
      <p>
       My friends grandmother survived Auschwitz. She went in to chilling detail, complete with Q&amp;A. The Holocaust was very real, just like every other genocide.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are blueprints for gas chambers. The difference for killing bugs and people is simply dosage of gas in the room. All you have to do is look up blueprints of nazi gas chambers.

       Let's say it was just a mere 271,301. That's over a quarter million people systematically killed. That's still horrific. Fact remains there was a genocide. Even the most unlikely sources confirm it.

       Fact remains, there was a genocide. A lot of people were killed either way. I'm not going to believe the perpetrators numbers over the victims. The perpetrators have every reason now to down play the genocide.
      </p>
      <p>
       Who's been put in prison for simply questioning the holocaust?
      </p>
      <p>
       Just to clarify. I don't think jewish culture is entirely innocent. They have enough power now to carry out their own genocide. They kill palestinians over nothing, so israel can expand. Any one who stands behind israel is complicit in genocide. Making them no better than nazis at this point.
      </p>
      <p>
       Same goes for any nation in the americas, australia, huge swaths of africa, multiple parts of asia. Nationalism ultimately begets genocide.

       A majority of those people would have died from typhus and starvation. These were labor camps but that narrative doesn't suit the Zionist agenda. There are an awful lot of holocaust survivors. Any historical event that needs the law and thuggery to protect it from scrutiny most probably doesn't  have the facts on its side.

       It was a genocide. That's the bottom line. There is no denying that. If you want to pretend it's better they were starved to death instead of gassed that's fine. Doesn't change the fact that they were rounded up and killed.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's hilarious how many people admit the genocide occurred while simultaneously pretending there wasn't one by talking about particulars and semantics.

       They starved because of the genocide going on already. It was necessary to bomb supply lines to prevent further genocide long term.
      </p>
      <p>
       You and I both agree there was a genocide, because we both know the basic facts. We can go to any website or ask anyone and confirm the basic fact of genocide.
      </p>
      <p>
       What you're arguing about is the scale of the genocide, and exactly how they died. That's your fragile conditioned paradigm. Not mine. I really don't care about the particulars of the genocide. Again, because we agree on the basic fact that genocide occurred. Jewish websites confirm it. Nazi websites confirm it. Everything in between confirms it.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's literally no denying the genocide. I don't have to go to fringe sites to look up particulars in a attempt to down play the facts. Even if I did, even they say genocide happened.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        My paradigm, the actual truth that genocide did happen, is literally proven beyond any doubt.
       </strong>
       All you can do is talk numbers and how they died to try and down play the basic fact. That is, again, you clinging to your fragile conditioned paradigm.

       6 million Jews were not killed by the Germans. There were no gas chambers to kill humans. There was no deliberate plan to exterminate the Jews. Yes, there were grave injustices committed against them but it was a time of war and international Jewry declared economic war on Germany. The Germans interned the Jews and kept them in labor camps. They suffered tremendously - like many others. The Americans did the same to the Japanese. The Jews do not have a monopoly on the differing during ww2 - tens of millions of people died. Thuggery and a corrupt legal system cannot suppress the truth. They are trying, oh boy are they trying.

       Notice that you can't argue with what I said above so you try and change the subject. Hilarious.

       Don't care about the 6 million figure. We've established that. There was a genocide. There's no arguing that. It also doesn't matter how they died in nazi custody, the did die.
      </p>
      <p>
       There was a deliberate plan to kill jews it was called the

        final solution.
       </a>
       There was also the much more well known Kristallnacht.
      </p>
      <p>
       So tens of millions died. But no, oh no, 6 milion jews could not have died in genocide. That's your argument. Calling their deaths collateral damage of war. Even though there's documented internal evidence from the nazis singling out jews, and numerous recorded public speeches of hitler singling out jews.
      </p>
      <p>
       nazi gemany was the one who declared war on jews and the the world, by invading sovereign nations. Not the other way around. It's not like their was an invading jewish army. jews didn't have a homeland because they were kicked out by persians. jews had no choice but to be internationalists.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes America is world famous for it's own genocides, that people also like to down play. Doesn't change the fact that there was a genocide carried out by the nazis on the jews.
      </p>

       Genocide is what happened to the Armenians. The Jews were put into labor and internment camps. Many tragically died from Typhus and starvation when the food supply lines were cut off. Nobody is saying some weren't deliberately killed by Germans. The point is, there's no evidence to say it was more than a few hundred thousand. Still too many. The Jews were to be relocated to Palestine. Hitler wanted them out for their betrayal of Germany and the economic boycott. The Zionists sold out Germany to drag the US into the war to help the British. In return the British gave them Palestine. Rothschild even admits to the Balfour Declaration in a recent interview. We don't have the complete truth and investigation and debate is not allowed. That's not freedom, that's not academic and that's not a service to historical fact.

       War started because nazis finished terrorizing and genociding their own civilian population, and invaded other countries to do the same. The camps were great physical evidence though. Nothing says genocide like mass graves and prison labor death camps.

       But come on, you have to see the nuance here. We are brought up to relate Hitler, Nazis, fascism, anything of that nature and by association pretty much all of the Axis powers of WW2 with "evil." If what your are saying is also common knowledge, though, that the British and Americans under various forms of leadership have committed similar acts that can also be classified as genocide, and I would argue probably killed more "innocent people" during the very war that is typically used to vilify the Germans as an expansionist, racist, human rights violating nationalist cult. In the US, tens of millions of Russians, Christians were slaughtered prior to the war. During the early 30s, the Holodomor consumed as many lives as is claimed to be attributed to the Nazi genocide during the war. In light of all this, why are we led to believe that somehow Hitler was "the most evil leader every to assume power"? Can't you see that it's a never ending cycle of virtue signal horseshit that will, as long as we allow it, be used to push one agenda or another down our throats through rote fearmongering, all of it based around what you've, however correctly, deemed to be the "genocide of the European Jewish people"?
      </p>
      <p>
       The only thing I can say as a positive result of this ridiculous canard is that the "Nazi card" is finally getting pretty old and it's used against the current president to the point of utter absurdity, but let me remind you he is not the first, nor the last political leader who will have that exact charge.

       hitler and the nazis were the ones who invaded Poland, Belgum, France, and beyond. hitler started the war. hitler and nazis publicly supported genocide. That is why they're vilified, despite other concurrent atrocities.
      </p>
      <p>
       What the other sides, groups, did does not lessen nazi genocide. It changes nothing. The genocide remains, along with the other genocides and atrocities.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not putting anyone on a pedestal. I've simply repeatedly stated that hitler and nazis commited genocide. Meanwhile various users have attempted to distract from that simple fact, using various methods. All have failed because even the most opposing view acknowledges the genocide, even if they try to down-play it.
      </p>
      <p>
       This isn't fear mongering. It's an accurate recall of history. This is a thread questioning the holocaust, also known as genocide of jews during the nazi-germany era. The only things in doubt are just how intentional, and just how many died. There was a genocide, carried out by nazis, on jews and others, that is an unarguable fact.
      </p>
      <p>
       The nazi card will never get old. It's a well known meme — in the traditional sense — which symbolizes genocide the world over. nazis did horrible things and lost the war. Hostory is written by the victors, thus nazis will be forever remembered as evil aggressors. No one will ever see nazis as victims acting in self defense. The idea of such is laughable to all except neo-nazis. Which is laughable it self because they voluntarily associate with a dead and defeated culture, good for nothing but misdirected hate.
      </p>
      <p>
       trump is just the most recent example of long ongoing american-national genocide, exacted upon the worlds already disenfranchised groups. Which no one here seems to have any problem acknowledging, as they point to it in attempts to distract from what nazis did.

       So what? It's what happens during wartime. The Jewish "Holocaust" is treated extraordinarily and doesn't deserve that attention if other atrocities are to be ignored. Also, the atrocities cited as fact are largely disputable. Scale matters, again, not in a righteous sense, but in a sense of public perception and social consequences.

      <p>
       Bullshit. Existence of gas chambers. intention to commit homicide, reduction in population. The scale and means and location of execution were offered as evidence in a court of law, much of it now proven indisputably to be fraudulent and false, to hang men. The publicity of the alleged atrocities was used to reinforce support for the state of Israel. The same is used to, to this day, extract special reparations for victims and their families with little to no individual verification, while victims of other atrocities do not receive this treatment.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, no... this "moral equivalence" bullshit does not stand up.

       Regardless of any diplomacy, hitler invaded poland. No army physically invaded nazi-germany.

       There was a genocide. That's a fact. Don't care about the rest, it's all an argument of perception, spin, propaganda to try and dodge fact.

      <p>
       Every neo-nazi, or "sympathizer," denying the holocaust is a voluntary straw man. nazis were the physical aggressor, and did carry out a genocide. Then they lost.

       Weird that Britain only declared war on Germany and not the Soviet Union, who also invaded. Actually it's not weird at all considering it was Britain that instructed Poland to reject diplomacy with Hitler. Are you completely incapable of understanding nuance, or are you just being thick for the giggles?

       You haven't presented proof of anything specific, so you have no frame of reference for using the term "denier." You aren't even clear about whether you think the mainstream Holocaust narrative is accurate or not. Also, the fact the Nazis lost should not have any bearing on the retelling of history. You yourself alluded to "facts and logic" earlier, does it apply to the loser of a war or is the winner allowed to make up the facts as he so pleases?

       You really haven't, you just keep saying that any number of Jews that died constitutes a "genocide" and therefore "Holocaust proven." I suppose you believe history is written through vague hand-waving?

       It's common knowledge there was a genocide. I don't have to provide evidence of the obvious. Even so, if you look though my comment trees here I did. I have stated over and over that there was a nazi genocide against jews. That is all I'm arguing. It's a fact.

       Lame as fuck bro.  You're engaging in a logical fallacy called moving the goal posts.  If the majority of those deaths were from typhus or starvation in the middle of the worst war torn country in history,
       <em>

       The funny thing is I went through University and 5 years into my career as blindly believing everything I was taught. I have a History/Political Science double-major, and have access to every research book and journal on WW2. None of them go into any detail on what may be the biggest story of the 20th century. Seeing that be the case time after time made me start looking into this myself. I wont convince you of anything, but I at least want you to start questioning. Hell, go open a King James Bible to Leviticus 6. That shit blew my mind.

       They most certainly did not have "leisure time" in extermination camps. Extermination camps like Treblinka, Majdanek, Sobibor or Belzec were just gas chambers/gas trucks and fire pits/crematoria. The were brought there in cattle trains and immediatly gassed and burned.
      </p>
      <p>
       Auschwitz was the only extermination camp in which some Jewish people were not immediatly gassed.

       But the majority of murdered jews (that weren't shot in massacres like
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babi_Yar">
        Babi Yar

       ) died in the extermination camps. And even in "normal" concentration camps, there was no "leisure time". I don't even know where you would get that kind of absolutely moronic notion. Those were slave camps. Read a fucking book by a historian and stop watching Youtube videos titled "THE TRUTH ABOUT THE HOLOHOAX - JEWISH PROPAGANDA EXPOSED".

       Can you imagine the fuel needed to burn 6 million Jews? Or the amount of gas needed to kill 6 million Jews? Seems like a lot.

       Probably not 6 million. A lot died of disease and hunger.

       I would have advised the Nazis to use bladed weapons to carry out genocide.

       At the same time mainstream WW2 historians (including Jewish historians) openly debate whether there was even a Nazi plan for the extermination, or if Hitler was involved in it. Indeed historians have found no order, budget, or plan for the "holocaust". This is common knowledge for historians, but forbidden knowledge for commoners.

       Orthodox Jewish Attitude to the ’Holocaust’
Delegation to Auschwitz
27 Jan 2014
      </p>
      <p>
       Speech by Rabbi Dovid Feldman
      </p>
      <p>
       Rabbi Dovid Feldman is a spokesman for Neturei Karta International and organizer of anti-Zionist events, lectures and public demonstrations, to publicize and educate the evil of Zionism and its misrepresentation of Judaism. Rabbi Feldman participates in national and international conferences.

       </a>
       <br/>
       ''Religious Jews, survivors and victims of the Holocaust, will for the first time since the founding of the Federal Republic of Germany, make a public appearance in Germany and express their view of history. They contend that the leadership of the Zionist state has no right to exploit the Jewish victims of World War II for their political goals, to evade criticism, or as an "alibi" for the oppression of the Palestinian people. This is especially true since the Palestinian people share no responsibility for the crimes of the Hitler regime.'' VIDEO:

       Its illegal to deny the holocaust. Not question what happened. One of the constant questions is what was Hitler's plan? Was it always mass murder or did it just end up there? When did Hitler commit to the mass murder? From the start? The beer hall push? When he wrote mein kampf? Questions are always welcomed and encouraged. To flat out deny it happened misguided at best

       Theres a difference in coming up with a different conclusion and denying historical fact. Historians argue about the specifics and points of historical events all of time. Only terrible and intellectually bankrupt historians deny and call conspiracy at established and well documented events

       lol.  'Well documented'.  Upon being challenged to present a single document in court proving the 'holocaust', Deborah Lipstadt, so-called holocaust 'expert', said she couldn't present that single document because the Germans destroyed the evidence.

       Do you have a source on that, because I can't find one. I can find a court case of her being sued by noted holocaust denier David Irving and Lipstadt winning that court case, but no actual source on her saying she couldn't present a single document, because that's not right, there are documents, first hand accounts, videos, diaries, testimonies showing it happened.

       sorry, well State of Israel was funded in 1948, after the WW2 as a reparation from the forces of coalition to the Jews. Before WW2, Israel didn't even exist.

      <p>
       In the meantime, I didn't read the bible, i don't know the exact words, but Israel is the promised land, from god.

       So now you have a bunch of religion people, whom a land was promised and they didn't have it, yet.

       The "Holocaust™ "? No. Many people people died in the war, and in the camps, though, but for the most part not a part of a systemic plan of extermination. They were work/internment camps, no different than what the US had for the Japanese. Were Jews wrongfully/unnecessarily killed? Absolutely, as were others.
      </p>
      <p>
       There was genocide going on, but also towards Christians, Slavs, Gypsies and others. Poland (my ancestors) we're fucked over by both the Nazis and Soviets. You do not here us pissing and moaning all these years later. There is absolutely no reason for the Jews to have a monopoly on WWII via the propagandized/fraudulent "Holocaust™ ".
      </p>
      <p>
       There is also no reason, if completely true, for there to be laws restraining people from questioning the official narrative. That right there is suspect. Truth needs no laws to protect it. It stands on it's own.

       Read the leuchter report. You can find it easily with a google search. That's about all you need for an objective, no emotional, rational view. Also read the work of germar rudolf and robert faurisson.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, there are some countries, such as France, where it is unlawful to ask the questions you are asking. There are folks who have been to jail for asking the very same questions you are asking here. For real. Now, if you use your common sense for a minute, what does that law tell you ? There is no such thing as a law that states you cannot question the overall number of deaths during WW2, or the number of deaths in Cambodia under pol pot and its circumstances, or the number of deaths among indian-americans. The list goes on. Why ? Because all these sad and horrible events happened for real.

       Not necessarily. I haven't read it, but AFAIK, it doesn't answer OP's questions.

      <p>
       The leuchter report doesn't acknowledge or deny anything. It is from a guy who was specialized in the design of execution hardware used in prisons throughout the United States. He even built one chamber at the Missouri State Penitentiary at Jefferson City. It looks 1000 times more complex than what you see from the ww2 photos. The report states the extreme complexity and challenges that come with building a chamber. From there, it's up to you how you want to interpret what you read.

       Well, the first thing that needs to be addressed in ANY such discussion are the DEFINITIONS:

      <ol>
       <li>

      <p>
       Here we turn to an article published in Haaretz (Israel), April 18, 2004:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.haaretz.com/who-counts-as-a-holocaust-survivor-1.119868">
        Who Counts as a Holocaust Survivor?
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       [DIRECT QUOTE]:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <em>
         "Holocaust survivor:
        </em>
        <strong>
         <em>
          Any Jew who lived for any period of time in a country that was ruled by the Nazis or their allies is called a Holocaust survivor"
         </em>
        </strong>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       [provided that said Jew did not DIE during that time, obviously]
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <strong>
         <em>
          Who counts as a "Holocaust Victim"?
         </em>
        </strong>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       Following the logic from #2, the obvious definition would presumably be:
      </p>
      <p>
       [NOT A DIRECT QUOTE]:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <em>
         Holocaust victim:
        </em>
        <strong>
         <em>
          Any Jew who lived for any period of time in a country that was ruled by the Nazis or their allies
         </em>
        </strong>
        [AND DIED, BY WHATEVER CAUSE]
        <strong>
         <em>
          is called a Holocaust Victim
         </em>
        </strong>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       So, given the above definitions, the obvious answer to the question
       <em>
        "The Holocaust...did it happen?"
       </em>
       is YES - unless you reject the idea that Jews WERE persecuted under the Nazi Regime and that many DID suffer under those circumstances - often stripped of their legal and economic status,; segregated, imprisoned, starved, etc... but personally, I have encountered VERY FEW people who would "DENY" that Jews were IN FACT subject to persecution while living in territories under control of the Nazis and their allies.
      </p>
      <p>
       So THAT, folks is the TRUE definition of the Holocaust, and I, as a long-time student of the period of history in question, would not DREAM of
       <strong>
        <em>
         "denying"
        </em>
       </strong>
       the Holocaust when defined as such. To do so would be silly.
      </p>
      <p>
       But as is so often the case,
       <strong>
        <em>
         "the devil is in the details"
        </em>
       </strong>
       , and as you may have noticed, the primary focus of debates surrounding the Holocaust typically focus on the particulars of
       <strong>
        <em>
         who did what to whom, where, when, how and to how many...
        </em>
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       But the victims are DEAD, and so are most of the perpetrators, and the few remaining "survivors" will soon pass to the inevitable fate that awaits us all...
      </p>
      <p>
       So then, I ask: What is the benefit of focusing on the grisly details? Aside from prodding base emotions and feelings of anger, guilt, and a call to eternal vengeance,
       <strong>
        <em>
         what purpose does such debate serve?
        </em>
       </strong>
      </p>
      <h1>
       NEVER AGAIN!
      </h1>
      <p>
       We have all heard the oft-repeated phrase that has become the unofficial mantra of the Holocaust... haven't we?
      </p>
      <p>
       Well then, if PREVENTING a recurrence of such an event is the TRUE GOAL- whether the victims be JEWS or OTHERS, we should be focused on the ONE issue that is constantly DODGED by Holocaust Historians and champions of the "martyrs":
      </p>
      <h1>
       WHY???
      </h1>
      <p>
       If the recurrence of such an event is to be avoided,
       <strong>
        THAT
       </strong>
       is the KEY question that MUST be addressed.
      </p>
      <p>
       And do NOT buy the bullshit Post-It-Note answers such as
       <em>
        "because anti-Semitism"
       </em>
       or
       <em>
        "because Jews are scapegoats"
       </em>
       or
       <em>
        "because Christians hate Jews"
       </em>
       . These of-putting simplistic excuses are totally unproductive and will get you NOWHERE.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact is that the Holocaust was the product of
       <strong>
        <em>
         profound clashes between cultures
        </em>
       </strong>
       - and the problem is that the cultural friction that produced the Holocaust persists TO THIS DAY.
      </p>
      <p>
       If we truly want to prevent the recurrence of similar events, we must focus on the WHY, and deal with the CORE ISSUES.
      </p>
      <p>
       The rest is purely academic - an exercise in futility.

       Well I honestly have no clue how all these numbers were accounted for. The true number may have been way lower but keep in mind the jews were poisoning water supplies and ( through something i read long time ago) and were asking for it. Jews weren't the only victims of gassing as well, they were just the most publicized one.

       YouTube has a very interesting documentary of interviews compiled by none other that Steven Spielberg himself. Out of the thousands of people interviewed, the most sensational stories were selected for the project he was working on. However, they have the feel of seeing a bunch of people after a mild fender-bender on a city bus recalling how awful the pain in their neck and back is and how they definitely need a fat settlement for their suffering. The other folks though tell stories that sound, well, not happy...but more in line with what one would expect from people in a difficult wartime situation who are in the process of being transferred to Palestine. To my mind the documentary carried a lot more weight than all the mathematical, engineering, and forensic debunking. Hearing the story of how in Auschwitz the challenges the theater troupe had in making bunting and costumes really hit home for me. Also, hearing numerous people tell incredulous interviewers that they got MORE freedoms in the camps the closer they got to the end of the war lines up better with what I've heard from firsthand sources.

       I'll do my best. The man in question was mid-teens when he started working government construction. After Germany fell, anyone who worked for the government was rounded up. There ware lots of camps run by the allies, US and Russian. The man was put into a camp in France with a jewish commander. "Camp" implies at least tents, but this was just a field with barbed wire Out of 1500-odd captives, 2 were boys under 18 and only 1 was a combat soldier, an older Waffen SS man who looked out for the minors. After a few days exposed with no food, anyone becomes savage. This went on for a short while, then one day a bunch of trucks arrived, and the camp commander came yelling in German "everyone who wants to go home, get on the truck!". The Waffen SS man said to shut up and do not move. They drove the ones who got on the trucks out of town, lined them up on a ditch, and shot them. 1500 people- librarians, postal employees, pension administrators, construction foremen and the like. The man in question is a respected academic who doesn't deal at all with anything political in any way, who has authored a number of books and came up with a certain theory that is accepted as factual dealing with a historical topic in the far past, nothing to do with 20th century at all, and he still is working (despite being old as dirt) and still sharp as a razor, so I'm very careful to not shit in his Post Toasties by giving anything away about his identity. When he finally does pass, I will absolutely make a video about his story with all the corroboration I was able to track down after hearing him tell his story. I really wish the environment was more conducive to telling the facts of history, but as it stands right now it's not my place to blow up the dude's spot.

       That is an absolutely astonishing, and chilling story. The conditions that he described are certainly in keeping with what I know about post-war Allied POW camps. The only attempt at quantifying the death experienced as a result of these conditions, and perhaps of stories like the one you just shared, is the book "Other Losses" by James Bacque. I believe there has been no serious historical effort to corroborate the data, and WW2 revisionists tend to concentrate on the German perspective of the war and the Holocaust. This story is at least as important contextually, in my opinion, as either of those issues.

       The fact that you are "on the fence" on an issue with which there is absolutely massive historical evidence for is a false bid for appearing neutral in a debate where neutrality is asinine. But let me entertain some of your beliefs.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Six million Jews, were they gassed by the National Socialists?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Right off the bat you are stating a falsehood. No, 6 million Jews were not gassed to death. However, no serious historian would argue as such. However they would argue that around 3 million
       <em>
        people
       </em>
       (of which Jews were by far the largest group) died in the extermination camps. "But wait," someone just asking questions might say, "How were they murdered if not by gassing them?" Which leads into the next part of the OP.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        There is no doubt that many Jews were killed during the war, but an elaborate plan to exterminate them systematically through the use of gas chambers? Hmm.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       It might surprise you to find out that something called the
       <strong>
        Final
       </strong>
       Solution wasn't the first choice of the Nazis. The hatred of Jews among the Nazis is indisputable and went back years before gas chambers saw widespread use. Dachau, the first Nazi concentration camp (not extermination camp as there is a difference), opened in 1933 to house political prisoner and later Jews. Hell, Kristallnacht, which is often seen as the start of the Holocaust by many happened all over German and was mostly just good 'ol fashioned rounding up, beating and killing of Jews. And that would be the policy of the Nazis for years to come. During Operation Barbarossa, the Einsatzgruppen would just go town to town rounding up people and committing straight of mass murder. Of course to absolutely no one's surprise, going around murdering whole villages worth of people with a bullet to head is beyond mentally straining. This documented quite well in Christopher Browning's
       <em>
        Ordinary Men: Reserve Police Battalion 101 and the Final Solution in Poland
       </em>
       where numerous members of a Police Battalion turned death squad talked about how demoralizing the activities were. So eventually they switched to gas vans and chambers.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Why bother trasnporting them, clothing them, feeding them, fighting disease, have on-camp hospitals, have leisurely activities etc if they were just going to kill them?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Because they weren't always sure they were going to kill them. Jews were used for forced labor until the Final Solution went into full effect. Also "fighting disease, have on-camp hospitals, have leisurely activities". Seriously?
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Why on earth would they divert so much manpower and cash to something like this?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       In case you aren't aware, the leaders of the Nazi party were really fucking bad at management of the war effort. And the fact that they would dedicate resources toward hateful ideals over more practical purposes should be of no surprise to anyone. The whole Nazi state was built on untenable economic policies that would have failed in the long run and predicated entirely on conquest.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        As for impirical evidence, what is there?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       First off, its empirical. Second, I believe the most damning evidence is the fact that often times people just straight up admitted it. In the previously mentioned
       <em>
        Ordinary Men
       </em>
       there were many men who willing when asked admitted to it. In fact, as far as I am aware, no put on trial for war crimes surrounding the Nazi regime claimed straight up said they never happened. Sure they tried to deny responsibility, but never were they dumb enough to try say they never happened.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the rest of your points, frankly I don't care enough to delve in further antisemitic websites as I have already done. You can say that being "objective" should be the goal and it should be, but that isn't what this post is looking for. The Holocaust objectively happened. What you are doing is conforming to the absolute worst examples of
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument_to_moderation">
        argument to moderation
       </a>
       out there. The truth isn't always in the middle.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fuck it, I know where I am posting this and I fully expected it to be ignored and/or downvoted, but whatever. If OP is in any way sincere in being "objective" maybe they will actually listen.

       None of those existed in extermination camps. Every exterination camp except for Auschwitz was basically a gas chamber and crematoria/burning pits,

       To add to that, the Nazis were
       <em>
        really
       </em>
       <em>
        fucking
       </em>
       anti-Semitic. That was their motivation. Anti-semitism permeated the german society at the time, going so far as to make soldiers not think of Jews as human. Letters from Wehrmacht soldiers regularly describe their impressions of
       <em>
        "Ostjuden"
       </em>
       (Eastern european jews) as disgusting, unhuman- and vermin-like.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, the use of slave labour was important to the german war effort. The Nazis were chronically short on manpower, during the whole war.
      </p>
      <p>
       They also made a lot of money by robbing the jews of their fortune. From 1933-45 the "arianised" the German economy, which just meant the expropriation of the german jewish population, which at the same time was meant to make them flee the country. During the war the assets of the murdered Jewish people were seized for the war effort, bringing this robbery to it's extreme.

       I mean, you said a lot but you did not provide any citation whatever.

Anyway you've got your orthodox figures all wrong, they cite Benz now, who goes for "at least 5.1 million Jews" based on careful selection and application of meaning to the population statistics of various European countries.

       This is the silliest explanation for the holocaust imaginable.  Their main task was maintaining order and security within the rear areas of the German armies on the eastern front. This included the gathering of intelligence and especially the combating and repression of partisans.
      </p>
      <p>
       They are supposedly responsible for Poland, Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, Belarus, Ukraine, the Crimea, areas of the Caucasus, and occupied Russia and all of Germany.  Several thousand kilometers of area during war with all military vehicles reserved for fighting and transportation, meaning they were mostly walking between areas.   This must have been a monumentally large gruop of people.
      </p>
      <p>
       Except it wasnt.  The Einsatzgruppen consisted of four main groups - A, B, C, and D - each comprising between 300 and 500 men.  These arent 100% uptime either.  They go on leave, have breaks, rotations, etc.  It is also not all death squad members.  This includes radiomen, transport, administration, etc.   We are talking under 2000 people for the duration of the entire war that are also secretly being attributed with the deaths of 3 million Jews in secret - all with no bodies found, no gas chambers, no mass burial sites, no fuel or burning supplies - nothing to support it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Consider - an average police force for a large city (NY, LA, etc) is approximately 10,000 people.  Thats everyone involved, not just beat cops.  They police a city a few square km in size.  And theres still crime and people escaping their watch.  Einsatzgruppen had far less people and almost an entire continent across varying terrain and numerous cities and towns and had to round up, identify and kill 3 million+ Jews without anyone knowing, burn the bodies, hide them and make sure no graves or bones or proof is ever found.    Now, many estimate it at about 1.5 million Jews, but like you say, some estimate 3 million+ to make up for the shrinking camp numbers to maintain the 6 million story.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ask yourself this - how can roaming groups of 4-8 men in a tiny 2000 man group (not even a real military unit once you factor in staff and admins) went around killing millions of people, hide all proof and not go insane from the absolute carnage and psychopathic rampage you just attributed to this small contingent of people.

       There are countless references to the magical number of "six million", referring to Jews being in danger, or being victimized in Russia, or threatened in Europe and so on and so forth from the late 1800's right up to the claim of six million being exterminated during WWII. There's even a reference to that number in the Talmud concerning a prophecy regarding the Jews finally returning to the Holy Land minus "six million" of them.
      </p>
      <p>
       According to the International Red Cross that did a thorough investigation of all the camps and their records right after the end of the war and tallied all the deaths, including gypsies and the full range of "undesirables" that died in them during the course of the war, the grand total came to about 275,000, a lot of which they attributed to starvation and disease as the tide turned against Germany and country began to steadily collapse under the pressure of the advancing Allied forces and relentless bombing.
      </p>
      <p>
       A large enough number to be sure, but let's not forget that somewhere between 50 and 80 million other people were all killed in that war and who knows how many more from wounds and injuries sustained in it during the years that followed.

       No, the red cross never said 275,000 died,  they said they issues 275,000 death certificated were issues and the total death toll was unkown to them and not in their expertise.

       6million is already incorrect. The plaque outside Auschwitz was changed at the end of the 80s from 4 million to 1.5 million.
      </p>
      <p>
       The figures have been revised a number of times over the years by Israeli historians:
      </p>
      <p>
       "Israeli Holocaust historian Yehuda Bauer said in 1989 that it is finally time to acknowledge that the familiar four million figure is a deliberate myth. In July 1990 the Auschwitz State Museum in Poland, along with Israel’s Yad Vashem Holocaust Center, announced that altogether perhaps one million people (both Jews and non-Jews) died there. Neither institution would say how many of these people were killed, and no estimates were given for the numbers of those supposedly gassed."
      </p>
      <p>
       (Y. Bauer, “Fighting the Distortions,” Jerusalem Post (Israel), Sept. 22, 1989; “Auschwitz Deaths Reduced to a Million,” Daily Telegraph (London), July 17, 1990; ” Poland Reduces Auschwitz Death Toll Estimate to 1 Million,” The Washington Times, July 17, 1990, p. A11.)

       There is not a single primary source of written evidence corroborating that the so-called holocaust, generally understood to be a genocide against the Jews via gas chamber, actually happened.
       <em>
        Not a single one!

       And actually, if you go over to
       <a href="/r/holocaust">
        /r/holocaust
       </a>
       , pull up their wiki on the side bar, and read primary sources, such as the full red cross report, you'll realize it was all lies.  Read up on the history of the 6 million, when it started to be applied specifically to the internment of the Jews, and read up on the incredible shifting death tolls of each camp, sometimes by millions, the shift from "some camps were labor camps" to some were death camps, etc, etc.  It's like a 5 year old that keeps spinning his story that he didn't eat the cookie so that it's more and more incredible so that he won't get busted by his parents, even though they've known from the beginning it was a lie.  Soon that cookie was eaten by cookie robbers that busted in through the front door.

And the debate between pro and against is simple, these that believe in it say where did these people go, and these that question it, [mind you people with academic background], say how where they killed, since the official narrative does not hold up to any scientific fact.
      </p>
      <p>
       Amway as someone already said, the fact that is illegal in many countries to even ask these questions is enough to make us skeptical of the official narrative.

       Throughout history, since about the year 1000, Jews have been forcefully expelled from England, Spain, Germany, France, Lithuania, Portugal, Italy, Bavaria, Algeria, Morocco, Ukraine... They're doing
       <em>

       people don't like, and have been for a long time.

       That's a shame, I'd love to hear more. Is there anything you can talk about without revealing identities, or is that not the issue with sharing the information?
