<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>

<p>Welcome to Skull and Bones. The Foundation for Art and Preservation of Embassies is made up of dozens of billionaire families and politicians with ties to the global elite who are able to ship artwork around the world without passing through conventional security channels. They have partnered with the Rothschild, and Alefantis, The Podestas and Hillary Clinton are involved.</p>

<p><strong>Body</strong></p>

<p>50 years ago, the museum of Modern Art decided to spread “cultural diplomacy” by establishing a program whereby artworks could be spread around the world through American embassies. This matches similar exchange programs by the UK (GAC) and France (Foundation Pompidou, French-American Foundation). Hillary Clinton wrote an article for Vanity Fair <strong>1</strong> celebrating the 50th anniversary of the program. Here are some of them posing for a photo. <strong>2</strong> </p>

<p>Here is a detailed listing of the FAPE board members, which includes such figures as The Rockefellers, the Annenbergs (funded Obama), Tony Podesta, the Estee Lauder family, John Kerry and Meryl Streep.</p>

<p>Here is another member&#39;s list and event worth looking at.</p>

<p>Take a close look at that member list. It’s absolutely baffling how much money they all own.</p>

<p>The M.I.T. Negropontes, tied to allegations of pedophila/Epstein Island by Japanese journalist Yoichi Shimatsu <strong>1</strong>, are in FAPE (Pictured: Diana NegroponteJ <strong>2</strong>). Also, the M.I.T. Negropontes, tied to allegations of pedophila/Epstein Island by Japanese journalist Yoichi Shimatsu, linked him to a Cambodian location. This is another connection to the D.C. ring that few are seeing but is right out in the open.

<hr/>

<p>My research into the Embassy Art shipments began when the Howard Gutman Belgian embassy pedophilia scandal appeared on Voat, and somehow no one in the state department did anything to stop Gutman from doing his job.</p>

<p>( <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/10114694/US-state-department-accused-of-covering-up-prostitution-investigation.html">http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/10114694/US-state-department-accused-of-covering-up-prostitution-investigation.html</a> )</p>

<p>An ambassador, believed to be Ambassador to Belgium Howard Gutman, who &quot;routinely ditched ... his protective security detail,&quot; and inspectors suspect this was in order to &quot;solicit sexual favors from prostitutes,&quot; some of whom were underage. The investigation into Gutman was called off after his meeting with Undersecretary of State for Management Patrick Kennedy.</p>

<hr/>

<p><strong>Beth Dozoretz</strong></p>

<p>Today, Art in Embassies in run by Beth Dozoretz, a close friend of Hillary Clinton and famous for helping Bill Clinton pardon Marc Rich on his final day in office. <strong>1</strong> To quote Vanity Fair, Dozoretz became drew attention to herself when &quot;she played a key role in persuading her friend Bill Clinton to pardon her fugitive billionaire ex-husband, Marc Rich”. As is the case with most Hillary Clinton confidantes, the more effort they put into covering up international crime and trafficking, the higher they climbed. And even though Hillary’s state department did little to oversee embassies during her tenure as SoS, she still invested a ton of time and effort into promoting Art in Embassies.</p>

<p><strong>1</strong> ( <a href="http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2001/06/rich200106">http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2001/06/rich200106</a> )</p>

<p>Dozoretz has worked with Alefantis before and they are closely linked among the D.C. elite. This shows that Alefantis, at the very least, is closely tied to the center of globalist power in America, and with the podesta brothers &amp; company.</p>

<p><strong>Skull &amp; Bones, kings of opium and smuggling</strong></p>

<p>The Art in Embassies program is run by many members/alumni of the Yale circle of elites, including John Kerry, Hillary Clinton, Robert Storr (Dean of Yale School of Art) and many other industrialist families behind some of America’s best-known brands. The Sackler&#39;s, the family behind Purdue Pharma (Valium and Oxycontin), clearly took time away from their role as drug-pushers to promote the arts with the global elite. Here they are with their esteemed lapdog Alec Baldwin.</p>

<p>( <a href="http://i.imgur.com/F9wpq7x.jpg">http://i.imgur.com/F9wpq7x.jpg</a> )</p>

<p>This is an important detail I can’t stress enough. They literally controlled the Opium market with a prescription drug, exactly as the United States did in Afghanistan, all the way back to the era of the Opium Wars in China…which Skull and Bones controlled. Remember, these families are primarily located around connecticut.</p>

<p>The Sacklers, who have coordinated events with James Alefantis, <strong>1</strong> presented medals to Marina Abramovic and Jeff Koons, whose former wife stated that Koons made his Child touch his private area <strong>2</strong> both of whose work have been transported on these aircraft multiple times, some directly through the Tony and Heather Podesta collection. In fact, Podesta “gifted” transported some of Abramovic’s &quot;bloody&quot; work to Whitechapel, London, <strong>3</strong> supported in part by the &quot;UK Friends of the National Museum of Women Artists&quot;. Notice how they conceal their organizations--diplomatic groups functioning within art galleries.</p>

<p>The event shows that it’s not simply celebrating art, but actually announcing the sending of the paintings.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The event marks the beginning of a landmark collaboration between the Sackler and Art in Embassies. In coming years, <strong>the Sackler will host exhibitions of works by contemporary Asian and Asian American artists before their installation by Arts in Embassies at new U.S. embassies overseas.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here’s where it gets weirder. Jeff Koons was actually socializing with Philippa Rothschild days before the event. <strong>1</strong> Previous parties where they’ve been seen together in France include cameos by The Hearst family, the Lauders and other globalists. [Jeff Koons had literally just met the Rothschild Family in Paris, an annual meeting that appears to be coordinated with the Art in Embassies event.</p>

<p><strong>1</strong> ( <a href="http://www.gettyimages.de/ereignis/jeff-koons-honored-at-french-american-foundation-gala-157184148#american-artist-jeff-koons-attends-the-annual-gala-evening-of-the-picture-id157049776">http://www.gettyimages.de/ereignis/jeff-koons-honored-at-french-american-foundation-gala-157184148#american-artist-jeff-koons-attends-the-annual-gala-evening-of-the-picture-id157049776</a> )</p>

<p>In light of the French election, it’s worth knowing that the Rothschilds and the Clintons are two major pieces in a secretive, international group with access to cargo planes.</p>

<p>Please Note Koons had literally just met the Rothschild Family in Paris, an annual meeting that appears to be coordinated with the Art in Embassies event.</p>

<p><strong>Masterpiece INTL Shipping - Proof of Security Bypass</strong></p>

<p>One of the standouts on the Art in Embassies program is Masterpiece INTL, a Manhattan-based cargo shipping service specializing in fine art. While that’s not exceptional in itself, information on the Masterpiece website proves that (1) there is proof that the works of art can bypass security, and (2) that they also permit the shipping of “perishables”.</p>

<p>( <a href="https://www.masterpieceintl.com/finearts/history.php">https://www.masterpieceintl.com/finearts/history.php</a> )</p>

<p>( <a href="http://www.multimodalintl.com/">http://www.multimodalintl.com/</a> )</p>

<p>The description of the services of Masterpiece, located a literal stone’s throw away from the Rockefeller Standard Oil Headquarters, shows that FAPE’s shipping service gets special privileges when crossing national boundaries.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This includes in-house consultation and coordination of shipments requiring specialized expertise with other US regulatory agencies such as US Fish and Wildlife Service (for shipments that contain <strong>endangered species or animal products</strong>), the Office of Foreign Assets Control (for shipments containing objects whose country of origin is under current embargo with the U.S. or where cultural property restrictions are in place), Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms (ATF – for those works that contain such products), among others. <strong>We also operate and maintain a TSA Security Program which includes National TSA Security Coordinators on each coast, and worked closely with the TSA during the preliminary phases of the Certified Cargo Screening Program to facilitate the early approval of museums, galleries and fine art warehouses into the program.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>While their corporate headquarters are in Manhattan, Masterpiece International has other &#39;public&#39; locations which are interesting, including West Palm Beach and Miami Beach; places famous for all kinds of &quot;cargo&quot; so bypassing security is very convenient for them. </p>

<p>The founder of this shipping outfit is David B. Epstein (his genealogy is scrubbed as it that of Jeffrey Epstein, so I couldn&#39;t see if they might be actually related. Not much about David on the web, but there&#39;s this in the public domain. </p>

<p>( <a href="https://www.corporationwiki.com/New-York/Great-Neck/david-b-epstein-P4269592.aspx">https://www.corporationwiki.com/New-York/Great-Neck/david-b-epstein-P4269592.aspx</a> )</p>

<p>When I noticed that Masterpiece International has a business relationship with the largest shipping container firm in the world which is 49% owned by the govt of Israel, then it got interesting. You can see ZIM on this rate increase PDF from Masterpiece Intl:</p>

<p>About ZIM </p>

<p>( <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zim_Integrated_Shipping_Services">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zim_Integrated_Shipping_Services</a> )</p>

<p>ZIM is global, even has a port in Turkey</p>

<p>Information that ZIM moved radioactive remains of WTC and sold this &quot;steel&quot; to China had been completely scrubbed, but most people have heard of them because they broke their lease to get out of the WTC before 9/11, losing $50K in the process, which is maredly interesting.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Zim-American Israeli Shipping Co. moved their North American headquarters from the 16th floor of the WTC to Norfolk, Virginia, one week before the 9/11 attacks (VIRGINIAN-PILOT, 9/4/2001). More than 200 workers had just been moved out; about ten were still in the building making final moving arrangements on 9/11, but escaped unharmed. (JERUSALEM POST, 9/13/2001; JOURNAL OF COMMERCE, 10/18/2001) </p>
</blockquote>

<p>There&#39;s a lot on that topic, but here&#39;s a link with documentation</p>

<p>When ZIM moved out of WTC, an Israeli moving company occupied their floors but escaped unharmed on the big day as well. [How many Muslim owned companies moved out of the WTC complex just before Sept. 11, 2001? 0]</p>

<p>A year later, ZIM was busted with US/Israeli weapons heading to Iran.</p>

<p>So, crime scene evidence, armaments, what else? The closer to the top of the pyramid, the more interconnected it all is. Don&#39;t forget that all major art transactions are highly suspect and that &quot;modern art&quot; which is a farce, at best, is without value but is great for money laundering. See Miles Mathis excellent paper on this topic here</p>

<p>( <a href="http://www.mileswmathis.com/launder.pdf">http://www.mileswmathis.com/launder.pdf</a> )</p>

<p>Anyone with an Art Gallery whose part of the program can ship large, cumbersome, ridiculous, bloody, pedophilic works of art around the world under the supervision of the Podestas, Kennedy’s, Kerry’s and people connected to history’s largest smuggling rings?</p>

<p>This is the big picture that everyone is missing. And they’re pulling this off right under our noses. The Rockefellers run the folk art industry and are prominent donors. Tony Podesta is a record-breaking collector. They all visit the Venice Biennale and go to major art events all over the world. If you do not know what the Venice Biennale is, google the logo. Exactly logo to the FBI Boy Lover symbol. </p>

<p><strong>James Alefantis and the Comet Ping Pong Link</strong></p>

<p>The Transformer Gallery hosts an annual silent auction, but few have picked up on the detail that every auction requires the transportation of art from another country that we can now know is shipped through diplomatic channels and part of the same larger network of diplomatically-exchanged art. Per the Gallery program:</p>

<p>This is the 13th Annual Auction and a celebration of Transformer’s 15 year anniversary. The Italian Ambassador is our diplomatic chair this year – highlighting year long collaboration with the Italian Embassy in D.C., and artistic exchange with artists and art spaces in Rome and D.C.</p>

<p>From BrightestYoungThings <strong>1</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>There’s more than 175 works up for silent bidding this year – I think we actually have 190 works! We say this every year – but I truly feel this is our best selection of work up for bidding yet.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For more on James Alefantis and his friends; Google Heavy Breathing, The Apes Band and Pedophilia. </p>

<p>Be warned, what they say and the images and videos the bands produce are pedophilic in nature and depict torture. Did I mention the main singer of The Apes was a former Special Needs teacher. You can also google her name, I&#39;ll let you find it and search her alter-ego drawings of weird creatures. It&#39;s as if all of these people were abused in child hood and so too are they doing the same. </p>

<hr/>

<p><strong>Connection to Skull and Bones</strong></p>

<p>Alefantis’ connection to Skull and Bones is rather subtle, but it’s telling that all news media has reported Alefantis’ role as an event organizer for this group. This is two-pronged. First, he coordinates events with the Sackler Freer gallery owned by the Opium family. Secondly, regular Comet performer Kid Congo Powers is married to the curator of the Yale University Art Gallery. <strong>1</strong> You know, the former headquarters of Skull and Bones.</p>

<p><strong>1</strong> ( <a href="https://vimeo.com/67959660">https://vimeo.com/67959660</a> )</p>

<p>Kid Congo powers performs with DJ <strong>Baby Alcatraz</strong>, sometimes at Planned Parenthood events. <strong>1</strong> Remember DJ Baby Alcatraz was the one who owned what appeared to be Pizza Map near Marfa. <strong>2</strong> I won&#39;t be getting into the details of how perverted these bands are, as that isn&#39;t the premise of this post. Do know though, if you google some of these bands do not click tumblr posts of Google+ posts as many lead to boy lover forums and offputting and pedophilic pictures. </p>

<p>Kid Congo Powers, former member of Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds, shows a few suspicious habits on his Tumblr. </p>

<p>( <a href="https://imgur.com/a/ip3ZO">https://imgur.com/a/ip3ZO</a> )</p>

<ul>
<li>Making <strong>Erudite references to actual Bavarian Illuminati members and strange comments about the tomb at the Skull and Bones headquarters.</strong></li>
<li>Wearing a Bavarian Illuminati-themed Jacket</li>
<li>Showing up at Transformer auction around ambassadors</li>
<li>Vampire Teeth, and references to pizza and blood; so not a normal guy. </li>
</ul>

<p>We can’t forget Alefantis’ hosting of the Roosevelts and CFR-connected reporters like Wolf Blitzer. <strong>1</strong> A pizza owner who just so happens to know media affiliates for years, who would have thought. The fact that he and Dozoretz are closely linked in hosting these parties, and that major news networks seem just as involved in the afterparties, there’s no question why the entire Beltway wanted to shut this all down.</p>

<p>Note that you see the exact same pattern with Susan Alefantis and the Chris Kloman case. <strong>1</strong> Those who defended Kloman include CFR-connected anchors like Charlie Gibson and Clinton cronies like Ken Starr.</p>

<p><strong>Uribe and the Colombian connection</strong></p>

<p>The Colombian ambassador to the United States worked for a law firm that, around the time that Comet Ping Pong first became a household name, became involved in a case of satanic abuse homicide in Bogota. The murder of Yuliana Samboni by Rafael Uribe would not be so intriguing were the diplomatic chair at Alefantis’ 10th annual Transformer Gallery auction not connected to the same law firm as the assailant.</p>

<p>The blog ‘Blueberry Perspective summarizes the link very well. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>James Alefantis has political ties to the same colombian oligarch family where the rich architect son is involved in a <strong>satanic ritual abuse case</strong> with other people of a rape and murder of a seven year old poor girl, and it&#39;s being covered up in the colombian media, and by the colombian police, and colombia is a country that at the same time has the clinton foundation, carlos slim and frank giustra heavily involved in raping the natural resources, fake foundation activities, that all deal with youth and children, and banking regulations, are tied to haiti, robbing oil money killing union leaders and workers rights abuses, running illegal investment slush funds, etc</p>

<p><strong>Art world connections</strong></p>

<p>The reason that the wealthy run art galleries is that they have a lot of money and want to engage in improving civic culture. That would be all fine and dandy if nearly every major family involved in the Skull and Bones network seems to have a connection to this Shipping lines. James Alefantis, in a sense, works for the Maccoby family because of their links to the Folgers, one of the families involved in FAPE.</p>

<p>The Folgers are heavily involved in the so-called Skull and Bones power circle, and they share both the credentials of being an early connecticut settler family and having an ancestor who was ambassador to Belgium. Notice Alefantis’ proximity to the Folger family. From this Voat Post:</p>

<p>( <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1673862">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1673862</a> )</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Folgers, are a secret power elite family since at least the administration of President Dwight D. Eisenhower. Lee’s mother is Barbara Sue (Bitsy) McElroy.[8] She was the daughter of Harvard’s Neil H. McElroy, former president of the multi-million dollar corporation, Procter &amp; Gamble, and October 9, 1957, appointed President Eisenhower’s Secretary of Defense. Neil’s grandmother was Mary Camilla Fry of England- baroness, suspected British Knighthood bloodline lineage.[9]</p>

<p>Neil’s father is financial advisor Lee Merritt Folger– a child sacrifice (Moloch, also spelled Molech) pagan member of the Bohemian Grove.[10] Lee’s father was investment banker, John Clifford Folger (1893-1981), U.S. Ambassador to Belgium (1957-59)- Alfalfa Club.[11] The Folgers are descendants of Peter Folger. Peter was an early 17th century English settler of Martha’s Vineyard.</p>

<p><strong>Ellen Susman &amp; Pay 4 Play</strong></p>

<p>Texas Democrat writes to John Podesta asking to be Ambassador to New Zealand after her and her husband donate to HRC. This fits in line with the pay-to-play allegations surfaced by Guccifer 2.0, when he released the ambassador names and the amounts paid to Obama/HRC to get an ambassadorship.</p>

<p>But what’s more interesting is the Ellen Susman sits on the 2015-2016 National Leadership Board of the Blanton Museum of Art in Austin, Texas.</p>

<p>( <a href="http://blantonmuseum.org/national-leadership-board/">http://blantonmuseum.org/national-leadership-board/</a> <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/19/us/politics/well-trod-path-political-donor-to-ambassador.html">http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/19/us/politics/well-trod-path-political-donor-to-ambassador.html</a> )</p>

<p>Not everyone wants a gilded posting in a European capital. Ellen Susman, a Texas philanthropist who contributed $100,000 to the “super PAC” supporting Mr. Obama, has alerted people involved in the decision-making of her interest in serving as director of the State Department’s Art in Embassies program, responsible for managing the art collection that hangs in American embassies around the world.</p>

<p><strong>Amman, Jordan</strong></p>

<p>But the Transformer gallery not only takes art in from other countries, but also ships the art outward, as well. The presence of art by Matt Sesow, the artist involved in several Transformer auctions and who once painted an uncanny <strong>‘cumpanda’</strong> <strong>1</strong>, was featured in a Jordanian art exhibit. Notice the imagery of the gallery and it’s pederastic “Da Vinci Children’s Exhibition” and the all-seeing eye out front.</p>

<p><strong>1</strong> ( <a href="http://i.imgur.com/bdVvSBg.jpg">http://i.imgur.com/bdVvSBg.jpg</a> )</p>

<p>An interesting tidbit to add is that a Syrian diplomatic cable showcases one of the Jordanian gallery’s <strong>1</strong> exhibitions (Wikileaks - A Shout Out From My City <strong>2</strong>), and explains that the exhibition occurred under the patronage of the Ambassador to France. What is important to note is that the auction at the Transformer gallery hosted by James Alefantis was always patronized by a guest ambassador, who made a special art donation to the gallery. Is it proof that he’s smuggling children? No. But does it prove that his connections—including to the Rockefeller’s through Luzzatto, to the Rothschilds, to Skull and bones.</p>

<p><strong>EXTRA INFO</strong></p>

<hr/>

<p><strong>Historical precedent to Comet Ping Pong -- an 18th century occult club that lured politicians, lobbyists and ambassadors into a web of blood ritual</strong></p>

<p>Germaine de Staël, was not only connected to major American diplomats, but also to a mysterious building in Switzerland that Tony Podesta seems to be visiting today. Given their current relationship with ambassadors and actual nobility, it is highly plausible that the Podesta brothers and James Alefantis are involved in the same type of operation.</p>

<p><strong>Body</strong></p>

<p>During the French Revolution, several notable figures at the highest seats of power in Switzerland and France played decisive roles in overthrowing Louis XVI and guillotining the royal family. It&#39;s worth knowing that Soros-type bankers still lorded over Europe at the time--after all, this was the age of Rothschild. Jacques Neckar, from Switzerland, was one such rival and became a finance minister under Louis XVI for France. During the revolution, he barely managed to hold France together, but according to Wikipedia, he also helped spark one of the bloodiest days of the Revolution:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Necker&#39;s dismissal on 11 July 1789, provoked by his decision not to attend Louis XVI&#39;s speech to the Estates-General, enraged the people of France and sparked rumors that the king meant to attack Paris or arrest the deputies. These fears provoked the storming of the Bastille on 14 July.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But there&#39;s so much more to this. His daughter, Germaine de Staël, was a gifted writer and power player in the French Salons. She would end up being one of Napoleon&#39;s sworn enemies as she tried to subvert his power on several occasions. She was also married to the Swedish ambassador in France. While still young, she ran her own salon in Paris with the ambassador, and they quickly gained a reputation as <strong>being a hotspot for the actual Illuminati and Swedenborgian Cult.</strong> Quotes from the book &quot;Mistress to an Age: A Life of Madame de Stael&quot; reveal she was known to the American political elite as well.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Germaine’s salon in the rue du Bac had become a political meeting place for the liberal aristocracy which soon was to carry out the first phase of the Revolution. Gouverneur Morries, a frequent guest, described Germaine to George Washington as “a woman of wonderful wit, and above prejudices of every kind,” and her house as a temple of Apollo.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Evidence also suggests that the Illuminati/Swedenborgians were involved in some bizarre sorcerer deep-state activities, as we see now with Jimmy Savile, &#39;Especially&#39; Michael Aquino, wikipedia page scrubbed and the &#39;Podestas&#39; activities.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>[Monsieur de Stael] had also turned to the Swedenborgian sect, was deeply involved in the mysticism of the Illuminati, and indulged in conjuring spirits...In the Age of Reason, at at the court of the enlightened despot Gustavus, two opposed schools of sorcerers and soothsayers were engaged in secret and mortal combat. King Gustavus’ clairvoyant, Miss Arfwedsson, whose oracle he consulted on every important occasion, was all-powerful, but she was decidedly outnumbered by the soothsayers who surrounded the King’s brother, Duke Charles of Sudermania, for whom they predicted a glorious future. Most influential among them was the Duke’s friend, Baron Reuterholm, who, before witnesses, had put the <strong>Duke into a hypnotic trance to make him prophesy the role he was to play in the regeneration of Mankind.</strong></p>

<p>Baron de Stael already had attached to his embassy a Swedenborgian named Halldin, whose specialty it was to make spirits appear in mirrors (he thus produced John the Baptist) and <strong>to read the future in books stained with blood.</strong> Under Reuterholm’s influence these innocent pastimes took a more serious turn.</p>

<p>At one of the seances held in 1790 in Stael’s presence, a medium revealed that Duke Chatlr was “in possession of the truth itself” and that Reuterholm be his only instrument…”Mention of the King was also made; what has been said concerning His Majesty is of great interest but of such a nature that I dare not trust it to my pen.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They were literally performing mind control/hypnosis to major political figures to help them carry out political goals. This is congruent with allegations of both the CIA and Globalists blackmailing VIP pedophiles to further their aim. What&#39;s also interesting is that Le Bac was a favorite among lobbyists, and was actually known to court the most powerful American diplomats at the time. Staël met Jefferson, Washington, Adams; but what&#39;s most interesting is that Madame de Staël is (1) in such an identical position to American socialite James Alefantis, who frequently courts ambassadors from his art functions. Think I&#39;m exaggerating? Here he is hosting the Swedish ambassador. <strong>1</strong> Another Transformer event was even held at the French embassy, and Alefantis has helped organize events with actual French nobility. <strong>2</strong> History repeats itself, and there&#39;s even MORE proof.</p>

<p>In some amazing coincidence, Stratfor leaks indicate that Tony Podesta was subscribing to Stratfor from a property in Lausanne. <strong>1</strong> Turns out, he&#39;s actually connected to Lausanne through his family and through the art world: Several pieces by Giovanni Battista Podesta, one of the purported &quot;founders&quot; of Art Brut, appear at the Collection Art Brut, <strong>2</strong> located in a castle in the town called Le Chateau Beaulieu. He is a worshipper of Mammon. <strong>3</strong> If you want a better idea of what art brut is, please look here. <strong>4</strong> Art brut is essentially &quot;trauma art&quot;, <strong>5</strong> where victims of trauma, including satanist abuse and pedophilia, paint their experiences. I have spoken to actual art brut collectors who have confirmed this, and who have also admitted that many of the artists come from &quot;transcendental cults&quot;. Also, abuse victim Kim Noble&#39;s work is Art Brut. <strong>6</strong></p>

<p>We also know that Tony Podesta is connected to this Art Brut art movement for three reasons: (1) He opened the <strong>&quot;Art Blu&quot; café in Venice, where he owns another property, (2)</strong> <strong>1</strong> he owns countless paintings that are or could be deemed Art Brut and (3) <strong>James Alefantis is one of the biggest patrons of art brut on the East Coast, if not America.</strong> And the painters he helps showcase have painted <strong>pedophilia</strong> <strong>2</strong> and <strong>cumpandas</strong> <strong>3</strong> (Matt Sesow, the artist in question, appears to have been a regular at Comet Ping Pong). So what&#39;s the big deal with this castle that Podesta is secretly visiting?</p>

<li><p><strong>It&#39;s the old home of Jacques Neckar and Madame de Staël.</strong> Literal Illuminati members use to live there and held unimaginable financial power over Europe. Now Tony Podesta is directly involved with visiting the same property as one of the top--if not THE top American lobbyist--in the world.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The group at the Chateau Beaulieu appears to be still tied to pedophilia.</strong> 
There is a call to the board at the bottom of the page to go on an excursion &quot;every leap year&quot; <strong>1</strong> to Sciacca in Sicily. It&#39;s the home of a sculpture garden and art brut artist pictured here. <strong>2</strong> Now it&#39;s owned by a <strong>vineyard called Strada Del Vino Terra Sicane.</strong> <strong>This is their logo.</strong> <strong>3</strong> That logo is one we&#39;ve seen time and again--and yes I am going to make the case that Comet Ping Pong is far, far more than just a one-off fake news hoax. I think it&#39;s at the very heart of this organization, whether it be a place to blackmail people or meet secretly with members of the global elite. It&#39;s a perfect cover. </p></li>

<p><a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1955663">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1955663</a></p>

<p>Part of it states: 
&quot;In addition to continuing its support of individual exhibits of American art to foreign nations, the USIA and the Department of State also embarked on new programs designed to acquaint the world with American painting. One new initiative involved working more closely with U.S. businesses that owned large art collections in order to facilitate their exhibition overseas. More spectacularly, the State Department established the Art in Embassies program in 1964, which sought to turn U.S. embassies into small art galleries.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;In 1962, Edward R. Murrow, who was then director of the USIA, proclaimed a &#39;new and, I think, significant development&#39; in terms of art patronage in the United States. This was the &#39;increasing interest of large corporations - Big Business as an institution, as opposed to the big businessman as an individual - in giving financial backing to our performing and creative arts.&#39; As the &#39;interpreter of America to the rest of the world&#39;, Murrow was particularly excited by this development. &#39;The mere fact that profit-motivated corporations in a price-directed economy find good reason to subsidize the arts speaks eloquently against those who see in our system only the grossest materialism.&#39;</p>

<p>&quot;HE WAS PARTICULARLY EXCITED ABOUT THE OFFER BY S.C. JOHNSON &amp; SON, INC. (THE FLOOR WAX GIANT) TO SEND ITS LARGE COLLECTION OF CONTEMPORARY AMERICAN ART AROUND THE WORLD, SPONSORED BY USIA.&quot;</p>

<p>So, in summary, Racine, Wisconsin is a main root of Pizzagate and Global Criminal Corruption across every aspect of the network that is directly tied through Art in Embassies, political parties, major industries, freemasons, Knights of Pythias, Knights of Malta, Pilgrims Society and other groups involved at the highest levels around the world.</p>

<p>Racine is directly linked to the Council of 13 and Committee of 300 through Rothschilds, Rockefellers, Reynolds and Johnson blood lines with connections to British and Dutch royalty among others. This is why corrupt Boy Scouts Paul Ryan and Reince Priebus yield so much undeserved power. They are the front men along with others like Ashton Kutcher covering up the real true evils that we now know as Pizzagate and Global Criminal Corruption.</p>
