       A recent discussion with someone who was saying there never was a final solution revealed something rather worrying.  While he criticised mainstream academia by saying they only believe that there was a straight road to Auschwitz and you aren't allowed to say anything else.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is completely, undeniably false. Most academics now don't think the holocaust was planned out from day one and instead it evolved over time.
      </p>
      <p>
       Suppose this is a PSA of sorts.

       Actually the entire governments of turkey and Japan deny genocide where as the Germans are apologetic ...

       Anyway - I agree with you then original German plan was not gas chambers. I'm just adding they were desperate due to the war turning sour and didn't have the resources that they had when the Madagascar plan was devised

       Much of that is open to interpretation, being that Hitler clearly DID want to eliminate Jewry from Europe altogether and stated that plainly. Whenever specificity is brought about regarding that intention, his plan was always to be removal by planned emigration.

       Well, what's true is the concentration camp system imprisoned many, many people, Jewish and otherwise, and many of them died, probably many were killed illicitly. Barring hard evidence of the actual logistics that supported the alleged extermination operation, a paper trail leading to its initiation, budget, infrastructure engineering, etc., or determinate forensic evidence that establishes the number claimed to have died at various sites, I reserve judgement on the issue only to say that I have extreme doubt about the veracity, and certainly about the level of confidence in the orthodox claims.

       Many of them should be as they've proven bullshit. Others might be exaggerated or embellished. There might be some that are credible, which would be hard circumstantial evidence for illicit execution, but hardly provides substantiation for the entirety of the mainstream account of the Holocaust.

       Another way of saying it if you're desperate to reduce their crimes. Look up the Einsatzgruppen

       That's the sort of thing which is undeniable, if you put a tiny google on it I'm sure you'll find lots

       Why is it that whenever someone avoids MAXIMIZING the implications of Einsatzgruppen actions (or really any facet of the Holocaust looked at with a lens of scrutiny or doubt), then they are immediately seen as trying to MINIMIZE the implications of that activity.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes, the Einsatzgruppen killed many millions on the Eastern front, that includes Soviets and Jews alike, many belligerents engaging in combat as "partisan" militias (now lionized in retrospect, though they acted contrary to international law for warfare at the time). The activities of these groups and their association with local Jews are well known and even depicted in a Hollywood film entitled "Defiance" and starring Daniel Craig, in which he plays a Jew fighting alongside partisans. Many of the Jews executed on the Eastern front were found to be cooperating with partisan militias, just like what is seen in the movie.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is it possible that some "innocent Jews" were killed, perhaps illicitly, by Einsatzgruppen in the USSR? Sure, it's very possible. Should every single Jewish life lost in the fray of combat on that front be included as another casualty of an alleged but largely undocumented genocidal extermination program ordered from the central Nazi command structure? I don't know, you tell me. Keep in mind, the only way to arrive at the popular "6 million figure" is to do just that, and then some.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the assertion of "hundreds of first hand accounts of gassings," well, frankly, I doubt you can point to hundreds or even dozens. And yes, it would be nothing but a matter of course for Soviet Communists to manufacture such testimonies in order to whitewash their own crimes throughout the previous three decades and during the war.

       I don't know whom you are referring to but it doesn't make the mainstream narratives any more credible that one person you know is ignorant of their details. In fact, one wouldn't even have to know the minutiae of all theories about something to disprove some of them.

       Or maybe he is just creating a strawman and therefore arguing from logical fallacy. It's not as if Holocaust "deniers" are exclusively guilty of this. Michael Shermer uses strawman logical fallacy to argue against not only Holocaust "denial" but myriad topics on almost every occasion.
