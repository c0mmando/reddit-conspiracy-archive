<p>Emails hacked by guccifer 2.0 at behest of Putin</p>

<p>Certain emails leaked first by Guccifer 2.0 –russian credentials (fabricated?) added prior to publishing (implicating DNC staffer?)</p>

<p>Why does the IC support the “russiagate” scenario so strongly without evidence, refusing to force DNC to hand over servers? </p>

<p>Comey possibly complicit – see Clinton email investigation
Supports deep state preferred narrative  -  see: war/Syria/Russia etc.
Partisan agents</p>

<p>Possible damage control by DNC: Releasing documents already known to be leaked in a controlled fashion to bolster Russian hacking narrative.</p>

<p>Was the Obama Admin. Complicit?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Susan Rice seems to be at least – re. unmasking/spying
Seems unlikely he wasn’t aware/involved in AG Lynch situation</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why did HRC hire DWS in a move so blatantly corrupt that it hurt her greatly?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>DWS had even more damaging leverage (Seth Rich etc.)?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why has HRC not been investigated for corruption related to the CLINTON FOUNDATION donations and related paid speaking fees (P2P)?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Obama knew, didn’t care? Was involved?
Trumpt biding his time?</p>

<p>Why is the media so intent on promoting Russiagate, despite complete lack of hard evidence? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is possible I may have got a point wrong - did not have the time to trawl through the emails/articles. I did my best to keep established  facts and theories clear and obvious to the reader. People may take issue with what I have described as bad evidence - I am merely applying the same standards a court would. If you go through the various IC or Crowdstrike reports everything is circumstantial or non-conclusive.</p>

<p>I hope this clears up confusion for people, or at the least illustrates to the Russia-gate proponents the rationale for those who view it as a witch hunt.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Im going to add a bit more to this, seeing some more sketchiness (this part would be Obama collusion)</p>

<p>Obama and team knew since August about &quot;Russia Hacking&quot; and decided that it was best to keep campaigning for Clinton thinking that she was going to win instead of handling a national security issue</p>

<p><a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/obama-russia-assumed-clinton-would-win-2017-6">http://www.businessinsider.com/obama-russia-assumed-clinton-would-win-2017-6</a></p>

<p>Obama stated in October to the public that their is no way to rig the American Election (Even though he knew since August?)</p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/ZPpt7-QOGKc">https://youtu.be/ZPpt7-QOGKc</a></p>

<p>It took almost 2 Full months to kick out the 
Russian Diplomats for election hacking</p>

<p><a href="http://nypost.com/2016/12/29/us-kicks-out-dozens-of-russian-diplomats-over-election-hacking/">http://nypost.com/2016/12/29/us-kicks-out-dozens-of-russian-diplomats-over-election-hacking/</a></p>

<p>Its looking as if the Obama Administration might have possibly colluded with either Russia or another country to rig the election, and now they are trying to cover it up. </p>

<p>Im going to add a bit more to the fuckery as it adds to the illusion </p>

<p>When President Trump put Gorsuch up, Chuck Schumer stated to delay while the president was under investigation (publicly)</p>

<p><a href="http://m.huffpost.com/us/entry/us_58d1883be4b05542240222b5">http://m.huffpost.com/us/entry/us_58d1883be4b05542240222b5</a></p>

<p>But Grassley calls schumer out stating in March they knew he was not under investigation </p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/hAhRdhfcVwg">https://youtu.be/hAhRdhfcVwg</a></p>

<p>This would entail a ton of obstruction under false pretenses for a fake narrative</p>

<p>Tons of fuckery on the Democrat side. Wonder what they are hiding</p>

<p>Did you forget about merrick garland? it doesn&#39;t take a conspiracy to say the dems would use any excuse they possibly could to try and stop the seat being filled that was obstructed under false pretenses for a fake narrative.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Im not sure which way your trying to push the story but ill talk about Merrick Garland.</p>

<p>As for Merrick Garland, the GOP filibustered. Which is fine. I would assume that this would be fine on both sides. Just like for Gorsuch. The Dems screwed this up for themselves. They lost many seats, and since it went on for 10 months without Dems attempting to do something, that would mean they either did not care, or were expecting the next president to be a Dem and would sort itself out. Filibuster and pushing a false narrative, when you know what youre saying is a lie, is two different things</p>

<p>If obama would have said something back in August instead of going out and campaigning and then lying about it to the public, at least it would make a bit more sense from a sitting president.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The republicans didn&#39;t fillibuster, they didn&#39;t even hold a hearing on him, which the dems did not have the power to do. And their reasons for not holding the hearing were completely made up because they knew they would look bad voting against a moderate that they had universally praised earlier (i think there were enough republican senators who had said he would be a fine supreme court justice in the past + the democrats to confirm him)</p>

<p>And the dems knew they would get rid of the fillibuster, so it adds more impetus to try anything to stop it.</p>

<p>And it&#39;s still a false point to latch onto trump not being personally investigated at the time, because his campaign absolutely was being investigated, and he is the head of the campaign, it is not unreasonable to think that as that investigation progressed some involvment by trump could be shown(which is what the FBI thought would happen), Schumer saying to delay until we know more isn&#39;t even a lie.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok i may be wrong about the filibuster, but I swear its what i read in a NYT article when I first wrote about it in my post.</p>

<p>Actually it is not false. Chuck Grassley states in the video i put that in March him, schumer, and a few others were told that the President was not under investigation. Chuck Schumer lied saying he was. </p>

<p>They have been investigating the Trump Campain since june. The FBI has still yet to come up with any real evidence, and now the false dossier, that the FBI used to look into trump, is back in play as coming from a pro-clinton group and now stonewalling on who financed it. (Which i believe was first given to McCain. unverified)</p>

<p>Crowdstrike never changed their attribution for the Ukraine hack, once again you are providing false information. </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s not in the report therefore it&#39;s not used as attribution. Perhaps other articles linked the two, in the official report that is the basis of the hacking conclusions, it&#39;s never mentioned. Also, the Ukraine hack attribution was never walked back, merely some ancillary details about it. </p>

<p>You are simply looking to discredit crowdstrike using a completely different campaign from several years back. It&#39;s like calling into question NYPD conclusions due to a report on a completely different homicide. To call them &quot;related&quot; is unreasonable and you&#39;re only doing it to color the commentary. </p>

<p>This still has nothing to do with attribution and the attribution to Russia was not changed, but you imply above a few times that it was. Really the severity of the hack on military operations was the only thing changed. This does not really call the hacking conclusion into question as you say it does. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not implying that Crowdstrike themselves changed the attribution, but that their attribution was bullshit to begin with. The app may indeed have been hacked, however, they walked back a part of their report that is pretty important to the connection with the Russian government (taking out Ukranian artillary), even if they themselves didn&#39;t change the attribution.

<p>That&#39;s absolutely not important to attribution. If you think that, you don&#39;t understand how attribution works. Crowdstrike did not walk back that artillery was taken out, just how much of it, that&#39;s a pretty small walk back. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are totally wrong.</p>

<p>Crowdstrike getting the Ukraine thing wrong is very relevant. Previous occurrences of malware or exploits are used to understand later occurrences or detect them using &#39;signatures&#39;.</p>

<p>The following is from a wired article on Crowdstrike&#39;s analysis of the DNC hacks: <a href="http://www.wired.co.uk/article/dnc-hack-proof-russia-democrats">http://www.wired.co.uk/article/dnc-hack-proof-russia-democrats</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Every action at a system level on the DNC&#39;s computers was recorded and checked against CrowdStrike&#39;s bank of prior intelligence (the company processes 28 billion computer events a day). &quot;Almost immediately, Falcon started lighting up with a number of indications of breaches of the DNC network,&quot; Alperovitch says.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So we see they ran their end point protection and anti-virus software  (falcon) so that it would detect any exploits running. Next paragraph in the article</p>

<blockquote>
<p>CrowdStrike checked its records, seeing whether the methods used for the hack matched any they already had on record. They did. Two groups, working independently, were secreting away information, including private correspondence, email databases and, reportedly, opposition research files on Donald Trump.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So you see, they used their records of previous analysis, CVEs and understanding of the exploits to identify them. The problem is, these exploits can be used by anyone.</p>

<p>If the previous analysis is wrong, they are wrong. You can&#39;t prove anything just from the exploits themselves and Russians aren&#39;t the only ones that use these exploits.</p>

The Ukraine analysis was not wrong about the malware or the signatures, that part of the report was not called out or walked back.

There is nothing at all in this walk-back that applies to the DNC hack.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Crowdstrike had no proof that the Ukrainian military was even hacked in their report. I&#39;ve read it. They found the malicious version of the application developed for artillery on a forum. This does not mean it (the malicious app) was ever used by the Ukrainian military. The Ukrainians deny that they were ever exploited by this.</p>

<p>Following the above, the X-Agent was already known. They detected it in an application posted to a military forum.</p>

<p>If you read the report, you will see they have no issues speculating as to the cause, scope, intent, and origin of exploits they find out in the wild. There is an argument to be made that their was a political motive behind that report as it is complete bullshit speculation and offers almost no real intelligence value. To assume they wouldn&#39;t do this for the DNC who&#39;s candidate they openly support is naive.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>That&#39;s not universally true, some exploits are only available to certain groups.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It was an already known signature, which is why their software detected it in the first place so people definitely already have it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>On the DNC hack: X-Agent is a known tool of choice by Russian state hackers. They may or may not have exclusive control over it anymore but it&#39;s use still telegraphs information about the possible identity of the attacker. If the Russian state government tool of choice is used and the hackers are otherwise highly sophisticated working with operational handoffs inside the system it still points to the Russian state. When you&#39;re dealing with state agents it&#39;s unlikely you are going to find a 100% smoking gun. It seems clear that the FBI and CIA have seen other information (see: recent CIA leak) that also points to Russian state involvement, the Crowdstrike report fit into a larger set of attacks already known to these organizations. You can&#39;t fake a campaign on that scale. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not going to comment on the Ukrainian report in particular because it&#39;s a different campaign with different details. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are many years that build up to this moment.</p>

<p>With the conflict in Ukraine, anti-Russian propaganda really picked up steam in the Western media.  It wasn&#39;t on the same level as Iraq War propaganda, but they kept at it persistently for years.  This was the mind-virus that wormed into the public consciousness to think &quot;Russia bad&quot;.</p>

<p>So when Trump said things along the lines of &quot;we should try to get along with Russia&quot;, the brainwashed masses recoiled in horror.  &quot;But they&#39;re evil!&quot;  This long propaganda campaign, orchestrated by the US/EU and international MSM, was what allowed the &quot;Russia election hacking&quot; narrative to be so effective.</p>

<p>I know this doesn&#39;t help your specific timeline, but the context is important.  The neocon Democrats and Republicans are all easily demarcated by their fervor against Russia, because really, there are no enemies of significance today for America, and the war machine needs one.  Russia is like the asshole cousin of America who isn&#39;t properly respectful and brings up shit they don&#39;t want heard at the dinner table.</p>

<p>I&#39;m also suspecting that the neocons are running out of trustworthy yes-men.  This is why DWS was kept in the fold, and why they are clinging so desperately to keep every neocon in power that they can.  This will all crumble if Trump roots out enough of the &quot;swamp&quot; and we may even see the MSM be unshackled, provided Trump isn&#39;t just another actor for the MIC.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s almost like it is a joke.  They know Russia isn&#39;t doing much more than being active in their immediate sphere of influence.  We&#39;re just bitter we don&#39;t have unequivocal reign over the region and don&#39;t like RT news.  </p>

<p>US/NATO is far, far, vastly more intrusive and aggresive.  It&#39;s comical to me that anyone in the West is scared of Russia or worried in the slightest about them.  Them having influence over some of their neighbors isn&#39;t shocking nor a reason for conflict.   Even if they were hostile, they&#39;re mostly surrounded and contained.  Hacking?  Paper ballots, problem solved.  </p>

<p>Even if Russia was truly hacking the US, the NSA/etc would have mounds of evidence and a massive counteroffensive.  To propose the USA is a helpless hacking victim is beyond ludicrous, they are the most advanced technologically with astronomical budgets.  There&#39;s no way anyone could control the USA with any degree of significance through hacking.</p>

<p>I think China poses a bigger threat to the West, they could wedge into a weak spot if we stupidly get into real conflict with Russia.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How Did The Trump Campaign Collude With The Russian Government To Hack Into The DNC When the Hack Itself Occured Way Before Trump Had Any Even Won The Republican Nomination?</p>

<p>What if he had lost to Cruz or Rubio? The emails would have been released either way.</p>

<p>The hack started in summer 2015. You are telling me Putin had the foresight to bet it all on Trump winning not only the Republican nomination but the election itself?</p>

<p>And what does “collusion” even mean? What, Russia needs help from the Trump campaign to hack into DNC servers? What, the Trump campaign had secret hackers somewhere?</p>

<p>When You Red Pill And Realize….</p>

<p>…the FBI and in extension our government has never independently verified the DNC hack because the DNC refused to let the FBI have access.</p>

<p>…that Mike Flynn’s ties to Russia and his firm’s business dealings with a Dutch consulting firm owned by a Turkish businessman were in the news before the election and inauguration.</p>

<p>…the FBI interviewed Mike Flynn on January 24th, before Sally Yates spoke to White House counsel, and he passed all questions asked of him and it was concluded he wasn’t being deceptive about his discussions in December with the Russian ambassador.</p>

<p>…that James Clapper, former Director of National Intelligence under the Obama administration, was labeled in the media as Mike Flynn’s number one bureaucratic enemy before the Trump administration took office. Clapper was the one who fired Flynn in 2014. Fast forward and Clapper puts in his resignation the exact same day Mike Flynn is chosen to be the upcoming National Security Advisor. Then Flynn’s phone conversation with the Russian ambassador is illegally leaked to the Washington Post by someone in the Obama administration. </p>

<p>…that Sally Yates sole reasoning for being concerned about Mike Flynn was because he could seemingly be blackmailed by the Russian government solely because he lied to Vice President Mike Pence about having spoken about sanctions with the Russian ambassador. Somehow, this decorated general who has been in the upper echelons of government for decades could be blackmailed because he told Pence a fib. Yeah … logically, it makes zero sense.</p>

<p>…that Sally Yates heard about the conversation between Flynn and the ambassador because someone illegally leaked it to Washington Post journalist David Ignatius who then publicized it on January 13th in an article. This leak of classified information occurred while the Obama administration was still in office.</p>

<p>…that proof of collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russian government can only mean one or more of these three things: Emails, tapped phones calls or an individual on the Trump campaign flipping and admitting the collusion happened. There has to be actual tangible proof, not heresay and innuendo. Verbal or a paper trail. </p>

<p>…that Trump could be impeached even if there wasn’t collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russian government. He has a tendency to run off at the mouth and under a spotlight and given his newness to Washington he could very well do himself in.</p>

<p>…that you can dislike Trump and most of his policies yet also believe that the Russia-Trump collusion story is fake. If thinking that the Russia-Trump story is fake meant you were automatically a Republican and/or Trump supporter then The Young Turks are Trump supporters, right? </p>

<p><a href="https://midnightawake.wordpress.com/2017/05/15/%e2%80%8brussia-hack-and-flynn-fiasco-is-political-hit-job/">I wrote this lengthy but in depth analysis of news reports surrounding hacking and Mike Flynn. Here&#39;s a great quote about hacking that was in the Washington Post in 2015: Even so, officials cautioned that it is difficult to pinpoint the origin or perpetrator of such hacks. “Attribution in this business is near impossible. Rarely are you ever able to say with 100 percent certainty” who was behind a particular incident, the official said.”</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think points #1 and #2 and #4 have the most solid foundation. </p>

<p>Just as an interested observer over the past year, just soaking in information from all sides for a long time, I&#39;d put my own personal full confidence behind the accuracy of those statements.</p>

<p>#3 still has some muddy waters that will probably never be resolved.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Personally,</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think Clinton, Lynch, and Rice are guilty as sin and the Media is complicit. I think it&#39;s plain to see that these people should be prosecuted in some manner (but probably never will).</p>

<p>Obama, I think he&#39;s more complicit than we will ever know. He&#39;s not just smart but he was the President. He&#39;s obviously going to have sufficient distance between him and any criminality, so there&#39;ll never be anything significant enough to implicate him. Totally Protected.</p>

<p>Comey is a more interesting case.</p>

<p>On one hand, he seems to be complicit in the cover up, the leaking, the &#39;intelligence community&#39; campaign against the current administration....... On the other hand, I think he knew full well if he recommended prosecution of Hillary Clinton to the Obama DoJ under AG Lynch, that Clinton would walk free. His non-recommendation, at least in theory, kept the door open so that the next (Trump) Administration could actually have a successful prosecution.</p>

<p>Comey seems like a bad guy, but he seems like he might be useful. He DID demonstrate slightly that he&#39;s willing to throw Lynch under the bus in front of Congress. Makes you wonder if he&#39;s a cunning tactician, playing both sides of the fence, and hamming up his adversarial relationship with Trump.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>slightly off topic but the bullet point about the DNC rigging the primary to shoulder out sanders should have an asterix. sanders wasn&#39;t in it to win, so he wasn&#39;t shouldered out (at least not until he got $200 million and basically tied in iowa, and had to be reminded of his role). the DNC&#39;s snarky, bitchy indignation with bernie was due to his renegging and daring to rise above his station (ever since iowa, when he refused to demand a recount, he proved the real left&#39;s pre-primary criticism/identification of him being the DNC&#39;s lovable, loyal st. bernard since 1992).</p>

<p>the DNC didn&#39;t shoulder out sanders, they shouldered out sanders&#39; supporters, which they continue to do, and which those supporters continue to allow like battered spouses. the DNC has basically left bernie alone so he can carry water for them, while using the the occasional &quot;progressive&quot; black swan to keep his supporters enthralled by false hope and distraction, and tethered to the DNC. </p>

<p>and it works, like it always has evervsince that army brat agent provacteur laurel &quot;counter culture&quot; rock god frauds, like morrison (son of the person who invented the gulf of tonkin lie, and thus the person truly responsible for vietnam), launched the glorification of huxley-ian hedonistic slavery by elevating acid, self-absorbtion, self-expression, and the idea that one&#39;s minority identity was all that mattered (tune in, turn on, drop out, was the very same thing the slaves in brave new world were told and it still to this day isvtreated with awe and reverance. fucking baby boomers). </p>

<p>jim morrison and frank zappa and timothy leary stripped economic equality and fighting against the explotation of workers, the be all and end all of the left, from the the left and killed it, poof, over-night.</p>

<p>bernie supporters, out blind faith in him, are refusing to spend their energies working for real change by building a coalition with libertarians, anarchists, greens, lukewarm trump supporters, and the 60% of americans who have given up on our sham political system. they should be working with libertarians to use the libertarians 5% to overturn the system, instead the dreaming of a 78 yr old messiah, like lotus eaters. anarchists and greens agree with libertaritans on 2/3 oftheir platform, civil liberties and anti-imperialism. fixing those two problems would go alo g with fixing the third we don&#39;t  agree on...but noooo, bernie was cheated. bernie is holy. bernie hates third parties. any criticism of bernie is DNC/trump propaganda.</p>

<p>tldr--the DNC didn&#39;t really cheat bernie. they followed the scropt they and bernie drafted in jan 2015.</p>

<p>This is so hilariously stupid.</p>

<p>Susan Rice <em>by definition</em> didn&#39;t know that she would be unmasking people from the Trump campaign. That&#39;s what &quot;unmasking&quot; fucking is. You can&#39;t &quot;unmask&quot; someone on purpose, because you <em>only get to know who you&#39;re unmasking after you unmasked them</em>. Any proposition that there was some premeditated plan to unmask the Trump campaign immediately <em>completely</em> collapses when one acknowledges that fact.</p>

<p>Basic knowledge of the English language and basic capability for rational thinking would tell anyone sane that it is utter, complete bullshit to try to assert that Trump&#39;s campaign officers were the target of some scheme to &quot;unmask&quot; them. How would that even go? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Rice: &quot;Ha I somehow know that it&#39;s Trump campaign officials in contact with these Russians we&#39;re wiretapping, so I&#39;m going to unmask them so I get to know that... they are... Trump campaign officials. Brilliant plan!&quot;</p>

<p>But Grassley calls schumer out stating in March they knew he was not under investigation </p>

<p>This would entail a ton of obstruction under false pretenses for a fake narrative</p>

<p>Tons of fuckery on the Democrat side. Wonder what they are hiding</p>

<p>Wasn&#39;t the correction just the number of artillery affected?</p>

<p>Crowdstrike never changed their attribution for the Ukraine hack, once again you are providing false information. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I seem to recall that part of the justification given for the Russia attribution was the same malware being used in the Ukraine hack</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s not in the report therefore it&#39;s not used as attribution. Perhaps other articles linked the two, in the official report that is the basis of the hacking conclusions, it&#39;s never mentioned. Also, the Ukraine hack attribution was never walked back, merely some ancillary details about it. </p>

<p>You are simply looking to discredit crowdstrike using a completely different campaign from several years back. It&#39;s like calling into question NYPD conclusions due to a report on a completely different homicide. To call them &quot;related&quot; is unreasonable and you&#39;re only doing it to color the commentary. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The central tenet is that there is a completely uncritical belief that it was Russian interference. The Crowdstrike examples are ancilliary to that. Pretty vital aspects were rubbish, according to the Ukrainian military none of the artillary using the app were lost while Crowdstrike claimed that they experienced &quot;greater than average losses&quot; due to russian hacking. Maybe &quot;walked back&quot; was poor wording, but it stands that their report was garbage.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I never claimed to be okay with other nations doing it? It is a given that it is a bad thing, which is the default position everyone already accepts.

    <div class="md"><p>Ok sure, but the point is that, outside of small venues like <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, it gets a vast amount of attention and awareness while western propaganda is essentially ignored and accepted as fact. The entire purpose of this sub is to speak truth to the powers that are ignored by the mainstream. I agree entirely that foreign propaganda should be exposed to sunlight, a function that is already being performed by the vast vast majority of media in the country. I feel like we are arguing past each other here, and it is possible that the topic has strayed into a place where we are both attributing mal-intent where none exists.</p>
