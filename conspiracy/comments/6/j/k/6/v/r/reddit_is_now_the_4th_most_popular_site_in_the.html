<p><a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/309fuf/how_reddit_was_destroyed_ver30/">How Reddit Was Destroyed (ver3.0)</a></p>

<p>The reddit of 5 years ago and the reddit of today are almost polar opposites. This website used to RUN on critical thinking, intelligent analysis, and sourcing credible links to support your arguments.</p>

<p>Yes, even with a front page full of stupid puns and FFFFUUUUUU rage comics, reddit was still an authentic website with a very minor shill problem and a user culture built on upvoting good sources, questioning MSM spin, and crowdsourcing to do actual GOOD in the world. </p>

<p>DON&#39;T BE FOOLED. Plenty of users will enter this comment section and try to push the fake narrative that reddit has always been the same. <strong>Anyone who tries to feed you that story is either purposely misleading you or lacking the critical-thinking skills necessary to properly interpret the world around them.</strong></p>

<p>It was a very different place back then and it was also very obvious to any adult with a ounce of common sense and real-world experience that the energy of reddit was like a glowing fire attracting every agenda-driven, power-hungry, lunatic right to it.</p>

<p>The community was so strong that it would have been very hard to simply come in and try to change things. The communal &quot;bullshit meter&quot; was fine-tuned and there were also site-wide checks and balances in place to keep reddit self-aware and relatively safe from outside influences.</p>

<p>Over the next 5 years, me and many people like me then watched the admins of this site completely sell-out and begin making subtle changes (that they were clearly being directed to make) that would remove all of these checks and balances.</p>

<p>Like everything else in this world, people with power have manipulated something that could have been used for GLOBAL GOOD and turned it into soul-less deception machine to funnel more money, power, and influence into their own hands.</p>

<p>It was sickening to watch and many, many people have been here long enough to have watched it all play out. Unfortunately a good number of those people left or just check-in every once in a while. They were good, real people, who spent years of their lives trying to keep this place authentic and the entire time they were being harassed by fake accounts and people too stupid to understand what reddit was always capable of (&quot;its just reddit, whats the big deal!&quot;).</p>

<p>Well congrats, now we have the 4th biggest website in the US, the largest message board in the world, a main hub of global information and crowdsourcing that has been turned into nothing less than the world&#39;s most influential Western MSM propaganda outlet.</p>

<p>And yes, it will get even worse. I have been saying it every single year for the last 5 years. It WILL get worse. And people (both real and paid) will continue to act like its not a big deal. Watch what happens in this very comment section.</p>

<p>Information is the most powerful thing on this planet. Reddit is the 4th largest source of information for a global superpower that has a larger reach and influence that any other country on Earth.</p>

<p>You should be afraid.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Reddit circa 2012 was a golden age. I miss what she was and despise what she&#39;s become. r/conspiracy managed to escape the onslaught for a while but the sewage is leaking in faster every day. They want to silence our ability to question and discuss their narratives on any kind of large scale. They use sarcasm, ridicule, character assassination, and fallacy to shut down and derail legitimate conversation. Ignore them and carry on. Stay vigilant. Stay skeptical. Never stop questioning.

    <div class="md"><p>That is the point. Since regular people occasionally submit images that have a corporate product in the background, a shill can blend in by doing the same. If regular people never did this, then we would know which posts were submitted by shills. Shills can only exaggerate the existing behavior of online users, otherwise they expose themselves. </p>

<p>I guess the only thing you could do is try to show that the frequency of posts with a corporate product in them has increased, or posts that have a corporate product in them tend to hit the front page more often than others, but you will usually not be able to tell which ones specifically were posted by shills (<a href="http://archive.is/ICGrl">unless the person admits to it</a>). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is a lot of stuff we know about social media advertising that simply doesn&#39;t get enough news coverage. <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/shills/comments/4kdq7n/astroturfing_information_megathread_revision_8/?st=j1y5la6q&amp;amp;sh=75667764">You can view all of that stuff here.</a></p>

<p>This includes major corporations and tons of governments that have either admitted to manipulating social media or have been caught. </p>

<p>Since Reddit has such a large audience, it gives even more motivation for the manipulators to show up here. </p>

<p>I think the most powerful technique they use is &quot;forum sliding.&quot; Say an information-packed comment is sitting on the top of a thread. They may use several accounts to post other comments. If one of those comments slides above the &quot;target&quot; comment, then they can post replies to that comment, pushing the target further and further down a thread. </p>

<p>2/3 of people never venture from the first or second page of a google search. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Instead he uses technology to monitor, for example, what appears on the first page of internet search rankings (it’s only really the first page that matters, as more than two-thirds of users don’t look any further than that). “Then we work in a more traditional way to get stories out there – genuine, new, positive stories – and those will fill the top slots,” he says.&quot; <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2015/oct/30/scandal-company-online-repuation-technology-vw-talktalk">https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2015/oct/30/scandal-company-online-repuation-technology-vw-talktalk</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the same way, most people will become exhausted early when reading Reddit comments. They will read the first or second conversation and then leave. Pushing a comment to the bottom of a thread or even the middle will censor that comment for a large portion of those readers. The same applies to submissions. The vast majority of people only read the threads on their main front page. If a post is pushed down to the number 2 spot on a subreddit, then it is censored for the vast majority of users. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I posted an album about chemtrails and geoengineering - I deleted it because I felt so scrutinized and judged for questioning and spending my time contemplating this idea - this concept that has patents, and photographic evidence. But it felt like an instant reaction, whether on purpose or just a natural distaste for that particular conspiracy theory. But it seemed like I was labeled an idiot immediately for questioning something that has been discussed before. I&#39;ve also seen a rise in association of theorists and investigators with Trump&#39;s camp, and I think this conspiracy community has been lumped with alt-right on purpose, in order to discredit anyone who speaks against the official story. I&#39;m immediately seen as a lunatic who rubs elbows with the ideals of white nationalists. Seeking the truth has become associated with fascism - a hugely ironic symptom of our deadening awareness of reality. Hypernormalization.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>[Here you go] - I had to make a new album. Something happens when I get ganged up on by strangers on Imgur and Reddit. I go into a panic and just delete. I start to wonder if they are right, maybe I am crazy for considering this. Maybe I should just forget it and look at these lines of particulates in the sky and just accept that it&#39;s fucking water vapor that just can&#39;t seem to burn off in the scorching sunlight. Honesty - it&#39;s been a long time since I saw a real contrail, one that dissipated in a few minutes behind the plane. I know what that shit looks like. And when I see what I&#39;ve seen over the past 6 years - I just can&#39;t accept that it&#39;s normal. The Imgur post had people saying that I could live near an International airport and some of this is planes just circling, waiting to land. I live about half an hour southwest of PDX, which is on the other side of the river. And guess what, there are days and days of clear blue sky and then the lines just come on in - nice rows, sometimes Xs, sometimes &#39;don&#39;t give a fuck if you see me&#39; curves and adjusts flight paths. Sometimes with dotted lines because the &#39;contrail&#39; just happened to pause periodically. Honestly it pisses me off that I can&#39;t prove it. But I can only trust my gut feeling. It&#39;s fucked up. I have a clear memory of a couple months after 9/11 happened. I was 13 years old. And my dad was driving. We saw a ton of lines across the sky, driving near his house in Missouri. He said &quot;There they are - the power lines of America. They can&#39;t stop us from flying&quot; and at the time it was a nice sentiment. It meant to him that we were not going to give up our way of life in the face of that huge disaster. Now I just see it as more middle fingers to The People right in our faces, right after all that death and lying. Right after most of The People all swallowed the big lie. There is nothing we can do to stop TPTP/Them. We can only try to point the finger and yell as loud as we can. Because to stop and roll over means we are truly divided and conquered.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I work about a mile away from a smaller airport.. Flights only to Minneapolis, Mesa, Vegas, Florida, and Denver basically...last Thursday, just a few blocks from work I saw a plane leaving a Chem trail, making a large circle... I snapchatted it, but like a moron didn&#39;t save it. It was over the city, had to be 4-5 miles up, and no way it was looping around to land at that altitude as I&#39;ve seen how they come into the airport pretty much daily. I still see contrails all the time, and they are on days when I can already see Chem trails in the sky. So that was a little bit of an eye opener. I&#39;ve never actually seen one changing its flight pattern like that before that was leaving a Chem trail... I&#39;ve been seeing trails several days a week lately.. That&#39;s the most frequent I&#39;ve ever seen them around here</p>

(chemtrails/insert theory here) which leaves me feeling insecure about my post from the beginning. So I just crumbled under a hand full of comments since I don&#39;t have an argument to back up my shit. You know what I mean? I have a bad feeling about lines in the sky that stay there for hours. And I don&#39;t have any information to back it up. But instantly I get links from people refuting chemtrails. I just need a few documents or patents waiting in a word document so I can reference that, make an counter argument. But it&#39;s mostly a psychological thing. I already am not certain, therefore I don&#39;t entirely believe it. There are other things, like 9/11, that I have more solidified opinions about, but without any ground to stand on I am easily manipulated.</p>

But too many people act like they found some kind of “real truth“ that usual humans would never be able to figure out. The problem is most conspiracy theories are too complicated to be proofen or disproofen that easily. Since that, you can come up with a lot of storys and pretend them to be correct, if no one shows you evidence to disproof them. Furthermore since no one is able to disproof you, your believe in the conspiracy will get stronger and stronger. That&#39;s some kind of nature of conspiracys. It depends more on your believe than on empirical knowledge, like religion. That&#39;s why I like to hear people making thoughts about conspiracys, but also beeing able to manage having some distance to them. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s very crazy and obvious to me how much Reddit has shifted and it turns me off from this website from how it used to be. I joined in 2013 and it was mostly just fun stuff to read about and look at it a mix of mostly non biased politic talks. Now I get on here and the majority of it is ridiculously liberal brain washing non sense with no discussion at all and just the biggest circle jerk around. It just takes an ounce of critical thinking skills to realize how corrupt this website has become. That&#39;s why I stick to just a few subreddits and steer clear of the front page or all </p>

    <div class="md"><p>it&#39;s true that the shill problem has worsened dramatically, OP, but I have to say - I was active on reddit 5 years ago. There was a lot of thoughtful and uncontrolled discussion, definitely, but the userbase at large was also much less &quot;woke&quot; overall, having much less comprehension of current events, and much less comprehension of the big picture in the world. The conversation was roughly just as controlled 5 years ago as it is now, the only thing is, it wasn&#39;t controlled by obvious shills, it was controlled by the consensus of what was normal and the deaf ears of the average users. On one hand Reddit has definitely become much more constrained and much worse as a platform, but on the other hand I think average people are definitely tuning in more and more and becoming much more receptive to what is what - hence the dire need to manipulate their conversations.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I disagree. In 2008 and 2012, Ron Paul was reddit&#39;s preferred candidate. Say what you want about the guy, but he&#39;s pretty anti-establishment, and the default mode of reddit was to challenge everything. Now, r/all is basically just establishment PR.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>worth noting though, beyond all the forum sliding and artificial politics threads, Reddit was pretty pro-Bernie too, and Bernie this election filled roughly the same anti-establishment niche that Ron Paul did. A major difference however is that Reddit back then supported Ron Paul after having Ron Paul essentially spoonfed to them, while Reddit more recently supported Bernie even while having the complete opposite spoonfed to them.</p>

<p>This site was libertarian (not fake libertarian, like what that party has become again thanks to hijacking by the TPTB) and now all the default subs and many of the social ones are unabashedly pro establishment and I government.

It use to be all the relevant information up the top of threads, knowledgeable people from all backgrounds being able to scrutinise the evidence made available, to be able to get a better understanding of any and all situations.</p>

<p>Now it&#39;s joke and pun threads where relevant information is downvoted or removed completely.</p>

<p>After reading the ex MMA fighter / ex cop AMA and he mentioned about the corruption within the force and that that they have already infiltrated reddit in big sub-reddit&#39;s moderators positions, it really became clear why reddit has changed. It was user driven content. Now it&#39;s manipulated and controlled content. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s us that needs controlled.

<p>&quot;I know these are supposed to mainly be questions from you, but there is something I need to ask you guys. As you see in this link <a href="http://www.wbur.org/news/2016/12/13/boston-police-social-media-monitoring-opposition">http://www.wbur.org/news/2016/12/13/boston-police-social-media-monitoring-opposition</a> the police are monitoring social media in very scary ways. The ACLU and the other good people in this article actually don&#39;t realize how bad it is. It&#39;s gone way beyond <em>monitoring</em>, they&#39;re actually <em>manipulating</em> and <em>silencing</em> people&#39;s ideas and opinions in favor of themselves, in a way the police should never do in a democratic society. They even (especially) do this in cases where they are being sued for misconduct or inappropriate behavior. They are infiltrating &quot;communities of interest&quot; all over the internet (including the ones here). They become Mods and delete threads and ban people for reasons a government agency never should. And worse, they&#39;re abusing Federal grant money to do it. Is this the kind of policing this country needs? Thought Policing? I&#39;m doing another document drop at FBI headquarters today around 1:30pm (can live stream it if you like). Anyone local is welcome to swing by and show their support (FBI Headquarters, 201 Maple St, Chelsea, MA). I&#39;m submitting my proof (on this and many other issues) to them, but I lack the techie skills you youngins have for some of this stuff. If you guys can reach out to anon...excuse me, I&#39;m a terrible speller...if you guys could reach out to anyone that might be able to help I would appreciate it. City of Boston corruption is best, but they&#39;re a Federal agency, I can hand them anything and they&#39;re bound to investigate. Send it to <a href="mailto:Tales.of.the.BPD@gmail.com">Tales.of.the.BPD@gmail.com</a>.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why assume malice when stupidity serves the same purpose?</p>

<p>I&#39;m pretty sure it&#39;s the same eternal September process that ruined every other website. Normal people are fucking idiots. The average IQ is defined as 100. Smart people will always be a minority, and smart, critical thinkers even more so. When any site gains more people than can assimilate into the site culture, the site inevitably slides into a bunch of sheep blathering like they know what&#39;s up. New reddit <em>is</em> user driven content, but the users are already far too gone to change.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nope. Bots and shills have took over. It&#39;s not just popularity because the site already had millions of users back then.

    <div class="md"><p>Millions of users is still a minority. There&#39;s 300 million in the US alone; the top 1% in intelligence would be 3 million. That&#39;s an IQ of 135 minimum. Not all of the people who first used reddit would be that smart, so the average intelligence of a reddit user then was maybe 115. Let&#39;s say a quarter of the US population joined reddit since 2010. The number of &lt;100 IQ people alone vastly outnumber the smart people, and the smart people had better shit to do, like jobs, than shitpost on this site.</p>

<p>This is one of the most overused phrases out there. Astroturfing is done specifically so that most people believe the comments and posts are organic. In case you weren&#39;t aware, <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/shills/comments/4kdq7n/astroturfing_information_megathread_revision_8/?st=j1y5la6q&amp;amp;sh=75667764">it&#39;s already a well-known fact that astroturfing is occurring on Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, Instagram, and other platforms.</a> Since we know it&#39;s already occuring, we can ask ourselves what the site will look like after it has been infiltrated. </p>

It now feels more like I am feeding a long time addiction coming to this place, rather than an enjoying experience I once had.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not that there was no politics, it&#39;s just that the political stuff was mostly confined to the political subreddits. The political subreddits were still skewed in one way or another, but the comments were more of a spectrum of ideas and less of a polarized battle where nuance is lost to the margins of discussion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I should be afraid? Maybe you&#39;ve figured a lot of it, but the main idea you should come up with is you should not be afraid, that&#39;s exactly what keeps (((them))) on place. Actually they are probably at some point letting out info with the &quot;FEAR US&quot; feeling attached to it, and you are either consciously or not spreading it as someone who believes the &quot;official&quot; 9/11 narrative spreads all the feelings/ideas it carries.</p>

<p>I&#39;m amused if anything. I thought the world an I were just a physical probability and pretty boring.  Then I started realizing shit and I feared, then I realized I am experiencing a world with a plot that could not have come from any movie of how intricate it is, and that is pretty cool.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe, sites like this are made out of necessity they don&#39;t sit around. digg(2004) was for science and political discussion, 4chan (2003) was and English alternative to 2ch, and reddit(2005) was to be the cultural alternative to 4chan. </p>

<p>For while these were all you needed, mostly cause 4chan generated other chans with different themes and focus. unless people go back to chans but those have a negative connotation. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>High five!</p>

<p>BTW, after noticing it happening on VOAT about a month ago I realized that Reddit also has me pretend voting. Yeah the icon shows I voted but my votes don&#39;t tally. Once I even watched my up vote take a post from 100% down to 81% and I know it was me because un voting brought it back to 100. So basically they probably have some of us set with code or whatever doing the job of down voting stuff for them even when we up vote. If I post about it anywhere I just get the usual &quot;it&#39;s normal vote fuzzing&quot;. If that shit is normal then what&#39;s the point of people coming here to pretend to vote, never mind trying to post knowing it will be shilled to death immediately. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Seeing Digg die was such a sad day.  I really liked that old site.</p>

<p>Reddit to me never really matched the Digg at its height.  It&#39;s always been very pro-establishment, loud, rude, arrogant, and dominated by stupid jokes.  It just has gotten much worse these past years.</p>

<p>I think the problem is the voting system and a different type of crowd as joined Reddit (less intelligent, more aggressive).</p>

<p>We are in desperate need of a new social forum site with new mechanisms.  Reddit&#39;s vote system is broken.  Voting takes work and most don&#39;t do it.  A special interest though will take the effort to vote.  Say you create a thread that say that ACME Inc. is planning on poisoning the local water supply.  Most will ignore this, but somebody from ACME Inc. will downvote this.  Interesting posts and comments are being mass censored by our backwards voting system.</p>

<p>There are many reforms that could take place.  </p>

<p>We could segregate users somewhat.  Say you upvote certain type of articles...then maybe the system would respect the opinions of other users who vote in a similar way.  </p>

<p>Some forums could have a pro and con equivalent.  Instead of bickering over whether a politics forum is too conservative or liberal, why not create both...then you can participate in the one you want?</p>

<p>It might be better to create separate down votes for spam, rude behavior and just posts you disagree with.</p>

<p>All moderator actions should be completely transparent, and appealable.</p>

<p>There are tons of ways this system could be improved.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In fact it could be more elegant to show total upvotes and downvotes. But to really tie things down, Reddit should come up with Bias and Effective. Bias could be a number between -1 and +1. Effective can then be calculated as follows</p>

<p>In case Bias is negative then </p>

<p>Effective = Upvotes - Downvotes + (Downvotes x Bias)</p>

<p>In case Bias is positive then </p>

<p>Effective = Upvotes - Downvotes - (Upvotes x Bias)</p>

<p>Now the difficult question; how exactly to calculate this controversial Bias</p>

<p>Naturally it should be based on the types of users voting, how robotic they appear and what is the past history of interactions between the two users (voter and voted) and can be refined iteratively.</p>

<p>For instance, high karma users could get higher weightage. </p>

<p>Users who have machine like usage patterns such as 24 hrs activity or just voting not reading or targeted voting where they arrive at a post unnaturally could get lower weightage. </p>

<p>Similarly if interactions are more uniformly negative or positive regardless of post content or when compared to other pairs, then the voters in question could get lower weightage and so on.</p>

I have a 6 year medal. I was here for that hilarious Ice Shampoo thing. 2011-2012 was indeed the golden era. But it seems the objective now is to oversaturate the user base and comment section with trolls, shills, and oppositional conversations. Everything on this site has been disrupted by a mass migration, whether by bots or idiots, but when you oversaturate the site with negative thought processes or the political social engineers, the ones who critically think and question, and most importantly are here to interact with other truth seekers, we get lost in the pile. We become the minority, even if it is manufactured. You can&#39;t win this fight, especially with the anonymity of usernames and throwaway accounts. Everything you read could be formulated to make you think a certain way. It&#39;s fucked.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You can almost watch the takeover from 5 years ago. It use to be everyone&#39;s opinion on this site no matter how good or bad. Then they started removing comments, banning subs, shadowbans became commonplace, the corporate shill threads for product placement, the constant repost bots, and finally astroturfing.</p>

<p>What they essentially caused was mass cynicism. Nobody believes anyone anymore, most are lies or half truths pushed by people with paid for narratives. The left did this and I hold them 100% to blame for the cry bullying bullshit that happened to this site.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I knew reddit had been infiltrated when, in 2012, I was being interviewed for a camera op job at the local CBS affiliate.  I had only joined a year before.  I was asked in my interview where I got my news, and I listed reddit last, and asked the company&#39;s #1 guy if he had heard of it.  He&#39;s got a terrible poker face.  I thought, &quot;Shit, if this local TV pusnuts knows about reddit, then the higher-ups must be all over it.&quot;  Sure enough, in my 5+ years here I&#39;ve seen a huge change in culture.  Reddit, for all its subreddits, used to be pretty united on a few core principles.  Now we are pitted against one another, and no one seems to stop to ask themselves, &quot;What the fuck happened?&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, ok, it&#39;s been a while, so some of this is probably adjacent to the truth of what went down, but I&#39;ll try to get close. Just before reddit made some big move as a company--perhaps it was putting its stock on the market, I don&#39;t remember--r/atheism was an extremely popular, dynamic sub that routinely made the front page. But that&#39;s not good for business, if you&#39;d like to expand the appeal of your website to the general sheeple, because Americans have a blind spot for religion and hold it up on a pedestal. It would have alientated newcomers to reddit, to constantly see r/atheism content on the front page. Plus, who wants to get the average man thinking about the politics of &quot;belief?&quot; No good.</p>

<p>The mods of r/atheism may have changed up. I can&#39;t remember. But all the sudden they came in with extremely strict rules about what type of content would be allowable, under the guise of making the sub better. They eliminated a lot of memes. They disallowed certain kinds of discourse. </p>

<p>People were disgusted. We felt we were being censored. It was obvious that these rules weren&#39;t about improving the r/atheism community but muzzling it. </p>

<p>Thousands of users migrated to a new sub. Many stayed and usage trailed off as the new version of r/atheism revealed itself to be hollow and boring. </p>

<p>r/atheism lost the content but also the user base it needed to make the front page.</p>

<p>The new sub didn&#39;t have the numbers to reach the new page.</p>

<p>Reddit was ready to be packaged and rolled out for consumption by the average American.</p>
