But as a US Attorney the smallest fuking grain of sand brought by the FBI to him was enough to get a warrant, convey a grand jury and have an indictment?!?! If anyone was,is or knows someone that has come under indictment in the Southern District of NY at any point in time, especially while he was there, you all know what I am speaking of. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What Im trying to say is, if by now everyone doesn&#39;t know, that he is a fuking liar. As a us attorney and fuking evidence brought to him was enough to warrant an arrest. Regardless of what it was. He sent so many people to prison that didn&#39;t deserve it, but bc they had a tiny piece of bullshit they went to jail. The conviction rate in the federal courts is like 98% I believe. </p>

<p>Petraeus got nailed and was actually releasing information to his biographer. He only got a misdemeanor. What&#39;s the hard on for putting 60+ year old women in jail for using emails in the wrong place.</p>

<p>Karl Rove &quot;lost&quot; all the republican emails from around 2001. You know... all the Iraq war stuff? Yet we never hear a peep.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I could care less who you support. Because it&#39;s obvious it&#39;s Trump anyway.</p>

<p>I&#39;m just a realist. I looked through a lot of Clinton&#39;s emails and they were boring. I love classified information and want more of it. I&#39;m not going to be a little bitch and complain about small bits of classified information so I can get my AJ sticker from infowars and feel like I&#39;m doing something.</p>

<p>It&#39;s really not a big deal in reality. You&#39;re completely bias thinking that the emails were nefarious. </p>

Famous baseball player lied to congress, what happened?
She authorized destroying evidence?? Thats considered obstruction of justice. 
She used an unauthorized email server to send and receive emails regarding issues of the government? Whether it was whats for breakfast or here is this nuclear launch codes, it was still illegal. You me anyone on this thread did that, comeys fbi would of been bulldozing your fukin door down</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is based on feels on comey. And you&#39;re absolutely right. It is even more mind boggling now that there is a republican doj and still nothing. Clinton is just a major example of the bullshit with the justice system. Lied on purpose? She said she never once sent or received classified emails!! Pretty sure he said he found at least 17!! And she was pretty dam sure when she told the senate over and over. How abt bengazi!? She should alone be in jail for that. Her husband and lynch for the bullshit tarmac, bush and cheney for 9/11. Etc.etc. 
But i also feel i might be dealing with someone who thinks the right to bear arms was meant for an intruder entering your home and the civil war was actually fought bc of slavery.</p>

<p>Bengazi, she was forewarned and did nothing to act. She even said who gives a shit a few Americans died. One was a freaking ambassador that she was in charge of. If something you were in charge of is under attack and you do nothing about it bc, you were sleeping which is a bullshit excuse bc as a former 1st lady she has secret service protection 24hrs a day they could have easily awoken her. There were cables asking for immediate military assistance and nothing was done. That there is a crime alone. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s what I said. Maybe they could nail her for mishandling classified information which Petraeus got a misdemeanor for while ACTUALLY intending to release the information. From what I remember from the Comey testimony about the emails he said there was no precedent and to go after HRC would be a witch hunt in the context that HRC cut corners and people want her in jail for it. She didn&#39;t intentionally release information nor was a significant portion of the emails classified.</p>

<p>33,000 of her emails were deleted and surely some of those were classified. All her emails around the time of Benghazi were deleted..</p>

<p>May have been may have. Yeah well file a lawsuit. OR write your congressman and tell him to file a lawsuit. You got all the evidence and you&#39;ve read every email and every classified email.
