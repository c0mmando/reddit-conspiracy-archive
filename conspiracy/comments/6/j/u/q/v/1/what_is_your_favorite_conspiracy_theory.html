<p>The (in)famous NASA video &quot;abruptly&quot; cuts off because the astronauts werent particularly interested in it. It was going to burn up in the atmosphere eventually anyway. Time is valuable up in space and they had other things to do, so they moved on.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s an interesting video that goes over some of the common Black Knight mythos and <a href="http://www.express.co.uk/news/science/600953/Alien-hunters-famous-Black-Knight-UFO-myth-solved-by-YouTube-novice-in-just-11-minutes">does a pretty good job debunking it,</a> imo..</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well if you like podcasts, a great place to get started is a &quot;hardcore history&quot; series by Dan Carlin, called &quot;King of Kings.&quot;</p>

<p>It&#39;s like 20 hours long, but it&#39;s an absolutely fantastic jumping off point for learning about this time period. It definitely deals with the, um, mainstream historical views, but gives tantalizing hints into what we may be missing.</p>

<p>For instance, the things I was talking about. Sumerian writing is often considered the &quot;first&quot; writing system, and thus marks the beginning of &quot;recorded history.&quot; So, that was like 5-6 thousand years ago. But Mesopotamia was settled at least 10-14 thousand years ago. </p>

<p>So what was going on in between? From ancient sumer, assyria, babylonia, etc., we DO have <em>some</em> written records that refer to the older time periods. One famous example is called the &quot;Assyrian King List,&quot; and is literally just a list of kings of assyria. But it implies that their kings go back thousands of years. And then there are writings of expeditions going through the desert in the second millennia BC and finding ruined cities of megalithic proportions.</p>

<p>Essentially, there is some solid archaelogical evidence of the existence of sprawling empires that existed for thousands of years, but left no written records that we have ever found.</p>

<p>This isn&#39;t necessarily about lost technology or anything, either, it&#39;s about the gradient of our advancement. We were hunter-gatherer tribes for a hundred thousand years, then the ice age happened. After the ice age ended, humans discovered agriculture and began building cities and societies. </p>

<p>It wasn&#39;t until maybe 8-10 THOUSAND years after the rise of civilization that the &quot;recorded history of mankind&quot; begins.</p>

<p>So just thinking about that time period, to me, is incredibly interesting.</p>

<p>Here is the podcast that can get you started.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Have you read any of Graham Hancock&#39;s books? He writes very interesting books on these subjects. Fingerprints of the Gods is his first, but I jumped in on Magicians of the Gods which is the newest book of his on this. They are different but touch on similar things, and being that I was moderately familiar with the topic, I jumped into his 2nd book MotG and it is amazingly interesting. Filled with facts, pictures, and theories it is a great read. One of the best books I&#39;ve read regarding this topic let alone conspiracies in general.</p>

<p>Piri Reis map</p>
</blockquote>

<p>ok
&quot;The Piri Reis map is a world map compiled in 1513 from military intelligence by the Ottoman admiral and cartographer Piri Reis (pronounced [piɾi ɾeis]). Approximately one third of the map survives; it shows the western coasts of Europe and North Africa and the coast of Brazil with reasonable accuracy. Various Atlantic islands, including the Azores and Canary Islands, are depicted, as is the mythical island of Antillia and possibly Japan.</p>

<p>The historical importance of the map lies in its demonstration of the extent of global exploration of the New World by approximately 1510, and in its claim to have used Christopher Columbus&#39; maps, otherwise lost, as a source. It used ten Arab sources, four Indian maps sourced from the Portuguese, and one of Columbus&#39;. More recently, it has been the focus of pseudohistoric claims for the pre-modern exploration of the Antarctic coast.&quot;</p>

Like, <a href="http://www.ancient-origins.net/sites/default/files/baalbek-lebanon-jupiter-temple.jpg">http://www.ancient-origins.net/sites/default/files/baalbek-lebanon-jupiter-temple.jpg</a></p>

<p>Look at that pic. The middle blocks are 1000 tons a piece. Our largest cranes can move 100s of tons, at peak conditions. </p>

<p>Not saying to change your world view based on a picture, but maybe don&#39;t be so quick to turn yourself off because society says to?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Erich von Däniken is full of crap.  He&#39;s like Linda Moulton Howe in that I think he truly believes everything he says, he just twists the evidence to fit it.   Usually by re-interpreting religious myths as caused by ETs.   I used to love listening to them both on Coast2CoastAM, the bits of truth they provided were always interesting and I really think civilization goes back a lot further than currently accepted.</p>

<p>Nobody can deny we&#39;ve lost a lot of history, but their jumps to &quot;it was aliens&quot; are always so ridiculous.  I think it does a disservice to those lost empires to assume they weren&#39;t smart or clever enough to do great things. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There was an Ancient Aliens marathon or something over the weekend and I was sick and it was hot, so I binged on about a dozen of them, and I completely agree.  While this show embellishes the truly fascinating stuff with hilarious speculative leaps that, to me, narrow the possibilities rather than expand them, it also explores incredibly fascinating histories behind anomalous relics and forgotten yet utterly fascinating folklore, religions, etc.  </p>

<p>The disconnect, I think, is that the success of this show is predicated on the hyperbole, but, to me, it would be so much more provocative if it opened up speculation to more than just extraterrestrials but the entire unseen realm.</p>

<p>I mean..why so many pyramids all over the world? why so many shared symbology (swastikas, god self icons, spirals, etc..) in so many cultures ? Why there is such a thing as the Monomyth? Why so many dragon legends and iconography is human is not supposed (by current scientific paradigm) to be in the same time frame as the big saurians? Why so many longevity myths (people that supposedly lived for centuries, even thousands of years)?</p>

<p>Maybe you should ask yourself why something you don&#39;t think exists has continued to be a part of human history for millenia. Pretty much every culture on the earth has a form of magic.</p>

<p>Because we have very active imaginations, see patterns where their aren&#39;t in, see faces where their aren&#39;t any, and a host of other issues.</p>

<p>We used to think that real monsters existed but, as we learned more, they went away.</p>

<p><em>But I&#39;m guessing you won&#39;t bother looking into any of it because you already know you&#39;re correct...</em></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just because a common theme pops up often in beliefs throughout history doesn&#39;t really mean much. We could go on all day and find various things that regularly are mentioned by people through history and will you also argue each of those are or were real? Because that would not make sense to do that. </p>

<p>Also just by the supposed nature of magic, you can&#39;t use history as evidence. The magic one group of people believe in is not in any way the same type of magic another group may believe in. The very existence  of one type of magic based on description would make others impossible to exist in some cases. </p>

<p>So if magic is real and all these different groups of people agree to believe in a type of magic.. What type of magic  is actually real then? It can&#39;t all be real. </p>

<p>Seems much more plausible that magic is just an easy way to explain things we cannot understand yet. </p>

<p>At one point in time someone would consider a plane or electricity to be magic but is it? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>To be fair, Crowley was kind of a hoaxster, and Blavatsky seems to be to have been the first in a long line of &quot;religious synthesizers&quot;, who use their charisma, yes, but also their captivating stories (Eckhart Tolle: &quot;I was suicidal and I had a vision and everything made sense&quot;. Blavatsky: &quot;I have traveled the world seeking out the paranormal and metaphysical mysteries, conducted seances, acquired strange paraphernalia, and perform odd feats&quot;), both of which are vehicles for a central message of &quot;all religions are one&quot;, with the central tenets being &quot;emotions are controllable; the self is god; no thing matters; &quot;I am&quot; is all the truth there is&quot;.  I think they are fascinating, each of these sorts of people, and I enjoy studying both their ideas and their personalities, but I do think it&#39;s a little weird. Like take Alan Watts, or Terrence Mckenna, they are fucking bad ass in all respects, to me. I have no reservations. The difference between them and a &quot;religion-synthesizer&quot; is that they are reverent in their irreverence. Like Watts and Mckenna will totally be down to say which parts of a religion is shit, but they don&#39;t, as each of them would say, throw the baby out with the bathwater; they still understand that there is something whole and beautiful and valuable in all religions, and I think that they would scoff at the idea of finding some unified spiritual equation, as if this great majesty we all merely wonder at could be reduced to something that could fit on a napkin. The tip of a finger, though..</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To give one solid example of the validity of that ancient mysticism you dislike, &quot;as above, so below&quot; just continues to hold true. Our science itself seems everyday to grow more and more, some might say, conducive to the spiritual, or, you might be more comfortable with the term &quot;non-physical&quot;, in the sense that non-local perception; fields of information subsisting past death; or information being processed within a field generated by the brain, are all being studied in earnest with firm conceptual and scientific standing from which these people base their experimentation. It really is a fascinating time to be alive. I predict that the adjective &quot;Galilean&quot; comes into fashion again soon.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So dmt is in our bodies, tons of animals bodies, and countless living things on this planet.   Its very structurally similar to serotonin,  and when smoked or taken with a mono amine oxidase inhibitor it sends you on the most intense trip of your life. </p>

<p>I will tell you about my experiences​. I&#39;ve seen what seemed like intelligent beings showing me different symbols and things, heard a song that was entirely made of the clearest tones imaginable all made within my own head and basically felt like I was being shown the inner workings of my own head. </p>

<p>So for one dmt is a schedule 1 substance despite being found EVERYWHERE in nature.  I believe the elites are very into this substance, and are being influenced by it, or are aware of it and trying to stifle the knowledge about it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s finally starting to break a little, fortunately, with states decriminalizing weed and MDMA trials for PTSD, etc.  It&#39;s really the power of entrenched monopolistic industries, quite frankly, like pharmaceuticals, liquor, tobacco, and the profit-motivated fearmongering snow jobs they&#39;ve run on the public.  I don&#39;t even imbibe (yet!) but there&#39;s no logic to it, just good ol&#39; fashioned greed - or maybe even something more sinister.  There&#39;s such interesting crossover between DMT &amp; ayahuasca visions and legends, folktales and religion, not to mention NDEs, remote viewing/astral projection, extraterrestrial (or extra-dimensional for all we know) experiences and paranormal experiences.  I would love to just devote my life to a comparative survey of all these different phenomena.  Have you read Hunt for the Skinwalker?  </p>

It&#39;s a chronicle of a stay at the Skinwalker Ranch written by Vegas reporter George Knapp (the level-headed and, to me, entirely credible reporter who broke the Bob Lazar story) and one of the scientists on a research team bankrolled by aerospace mogul Bob Bigelow.  Skinwalker is this twilight zone in Utah where virtually every phenomena you can think of coalesces - UFOs, poltergeists, cattle mutilations, dimensional portals, aliens, Bigfoot, giant spectral wolves, etc.  </p>

<p>I don&#39;t want to spoil what they discover or what it ultimately leads them to conclude, but along the way they lay bare some insane parallels in the legends of the tribal nations in the area and a lot of other research areas including DMT - it&#39;s in this book that I first learned about the clinical study in the doc.  Massive recommend!  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Earth&#39;s magnetic poles are undergoing a reversal that commenced just in the last couple years.This happens every 200000 years or so. This has profound effects on humans. Each human has a frequency they resonate at. This polar shift is causing human frequencies to rise and rise to levels unseen before. The Schumann resonance confirms all of this that frequencies keep hitting record levels. This means people are becoming more and more aware or &quot;awake&quot; and it begins an unraveling process. It&#39;s why so many people are beginning to feel different and reading into conspiracies. This process could take hundreds of years but the conclusion will be 5D consciousness. Humans right now are trapped in a dark 3D world controlled by psychopathic entities that feed off low vibrational energy (fear). In 5D humans will create heaven on earth as it was meant to be. Unconditional love will prevail over everything and humans will be fully in tune with their spiritual selves. We all possess the light of god in us and have spiritual capabilities unbeknownst to the modern human. </p>

<p>If you&#39;re interested in this I highly recommend you begin meditating immediately and research the 7 chakras including the third eye (pineal gland).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, I can tell you first hand since I begun meditating with a focus on the third eye there are tangible differences. I am much more intuitive than I ever was and have been experiencing synchronicity regularly. When I meditate there is a buzz centered on my forehead and it feels like something is pressing or flowing through it. Following a session there is a dark blue/purple ball of energy in my field of vision that I can focus onto different things. Sometimes when it&#39;s focused on a person I can physically feel a jolt of whatever emotion that person is feeling.</p>

<p>You don&#39;t have to take my word to believe in our spiritual capabilities.  The third eye was regularly referenced in ancient Egyptian art and Rene Descartes called the pineal gland &quot;the seat where the mind meets the soul&quot;.</p>

Water is tough to get around there are fluoride free water bottles that are expensive so if you can get a filter on your tap installed do it.

    <div class="md"><p>The third eye refers to the pineal gland. It is the 6th chakra. It&#39;s purpose is to secrete melatonin and DMT. DMT is found in all living things and upon death the pineal gland releases a ton of it. This is thought to be the connection between body and soul. However much of what we eat and drink calcifies the pineal gland and we are shunned from our spiritual capabilities. An active third eye will result in increased intuition and &quot;psychic&quot; abilities.</p>

<p>r/conspiracy is already flooded with Flat Earth crap, we dont need more people checking it out.</p>

<p>The REAL conspiracy is that Flat Earth Theory is a Psy-Op. The most accepted theory on r/conspiracy is that there are external forces constantly posting about flat earth since it makes people focus on discussing FE rather than actual conspiracies. Like, FE is comically easy to disprove, yet FE is the most common subject on r/conspiracy over the past 6 months. </p>

<p>Sure seems like its a distraction </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah man i know what they did making us seem like loons. When i said wrong i mean’t you have the wrong idea about fe and chemtrails. I know they are hard to believe but do your research on it. If you are on the side that they arent real set out to prove your view wrong with info from the other side. The flat earth is real, elites (freemasons, zionists, etc.) know its real and they worship the devil. </p>

<p>We are lied to all the time because we are being taught the exact opposite of what is real. You need to see that all of this is anti-God and anti-good. No one can dispute chemtrails because they are infact real. Contrails are tiny trails of water vapour from plane engines that aren&#39;t very visible and disappear quickly, where as chemtrails are a concoction of aluminium and barium and one other metal i forget the name of. This is all an effort to destroy God&#39;s creation. Aluminium isnt good for us, they put it in the vaccines, it&#39;s in our water and our food is grown with it, not to mention the deception that is fluoride. Soil has been tested in areas with chemtrails and its at exponential rates than should be. This kills plants and is paving the way for Monsanto&#39;s gmo aluminium resistant seeds to be the only way to grow food. </p>

<p>This world is run by secret societies filled with psychopaths who only want destruction (this is anti-creation, death). They are playing everyone like fools but even worse they are playing God.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is actually not just a conspiracy but a semi regular debated theory known as &quot;panspermia&quot;. The theory of evolution only explains the origin of species, not the origin of life. Earth just happened to sustain micro organisms for long enough that we came around. I don&#39;t hold a degree in biology or any science for that matter but it is my own personal opinion that life on Earth came from the ecological death of another planet; perhaps even Mars.

    <div class="md"><p>The most valuable part of the article is the links to primary source evidence regarding tattoo ink toxicity - and in particular, the lack of long-term studies to see if this stuff is safe to put into human bodies. For example:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>…the increasing popularity of tattooing has led to the development of many new colours, allowing tattoos to be more spectacular than ever before. However, little is known about the toxicological risks of the ingredients used.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>From a <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26211826">European scientific study</a> into the matter.</p>

<p>The long story short is this: just like vaccines, these tattoo inks have not been tested long-term on anybody. Those who subject themselves to it are acting as voluntary guinea pigs. It is madness.</p>

<p>It&#39;s presumably a spin off from the theory that the Hawking we see today is a fake and that his name and body double are being used to push science theories to the masses. But I&#39;ve not really looked into that theory, sorry.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good question. After learning about the nephilim I read the Bible with a different perspective. Not trying to impose my opinion.....just explain since you asked. I think ailiens can be demonic and angelic. I think ailiens can be good and evil. Just like humans. We are all parts of gods creation even demons. The fallen ones are out to manipulate and enslave us. The Bible says the devil came to rob steal and destroy. There is a story about 3 blind men describing an elephant. They each describe one part and they are all different and contradict each other but they are all right. So I think the ancients were more literally right than we give them credit for. When I was growing up I was told the Bible was symbolic, now I think it is probably more literal. heaven is another word for universe. Maybe Jesus was from the universe not from a symbolic happy place. But from an advanced evolved world where evil is not in control.? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Elicitations of fear are an indication of self-serving intent. Those who seek to serve themselves even at the expense of others often use deception and fear to create illusions that make others more useful to them.</p>

<p>Demons are adepts at this practice. Their offensive and disturbing appearance is a the product of their choice of how to interact with others, to make others serve them.</p>

<p>Life makes an energy of mind, of joy, in positive emotional states and radiates it in negative emotional states. Bullies, sadists and those who the phrase misery loves company applies to enjoy absorbing this energy without even realizing they are doing it. Even negative people that love to bring others down by pointing out faults and worries are doing it.</p>

<p>Demons are old and find this energy to be the ultimate resource to extract. That&#39;s why they look so scary. It provides utility. They can just be present and most beings will begin radiating their emotional energy, because they are afraid. It&#39;s like a vampire walking into a room and people&#39;s blood starts floating into the vampire&#39;s mouth like veins in the air. How useful to such a being.</p>

<p>This is why you will find that ancient beings that chose to serve themselves even at the expense of others, find demonic or fear inspiring iconography to be of high utility. It gives them control and energy.</p>

<p>This is one way to identify beings that made the choice to be useless eater parasite beings on others. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>something is happening in our national parks. sometimes when people go missing the federal government seems a little too interested in routine search and rescue ops. sometimes green berets are called in</p>

<p><a href="http://www.abovetopsecret.com/forum/thread856284/pg1">http://www.abovetopsecret.com/forum/thread856284/pg1</a></p>

<p>what peaks my interest the most is when they send in troops under the guise of search and rescue they refuse to let park rangers know what they are doing, where their teams are, and no sharing of information even though you would thing local rangers would be the most help seeing as they know the area. something is just spooky about special forces showing up armed for search and rescue in our backyard.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>yes the link above actually discusses the validity of the author of missing 411&#39;s claims. While one above top secret user claims he is just trying to sell books by ommiting details the smmount of strange and unexplained circumstances in a lot of cases still causes me to believe some strange is happening.</p>

<p>An example is clothes of the missing children and items being found months later neatly left near where they disappeared months later and looking like no noticeable weathering or aging. Cases where the military units always being armed as if for combat, and the sheer number of cases.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In the 1970s, AT&amp;T was the only game in town for telephone calls.  (They had a monopoly on the whole USA phone system back then).  In particular, they subcontracted to an Israeli company to do all the long distance billing.  Anyway, this company (forgot the name, anyone remember?) was permitted to essentially tap every phone in the USA so they put together a very well organized blackmail operation which is why Israel gets more foreign aid than all other countries combined and no US politician can EVER say anything bad about the government of Israel.  Since they were doing it first, international bankers wanted in on the game so they made the NSA tap all US phones for them, too.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My favorite conspiracy theory was my very first one. Back in the late 90&#39;s I was getting into hacking and warez/private ftp and computing in general, and I was doing some studying up on supercomputers. Well, during the process of researching supercomputers, I noticed that there was a side-story to a bigger story that involved one at Los Alamos researching the origin of the aids virus.</p>

<p>Some might remember, there was a big fire at Los Alamos, and they evacuated almost the entire facility. At the same time, there were reports of a chinese spy being caught destroying hard-drives or something like that. After the fire was put out though, the researchers in charge of the supercomputer doing the aids origin virus research, which had been going on for years, came back and said almost all their data was corrupted.  </p>

<p>It was then I formed my first original conspiracy theory. The fire at Los Alamos was usedor created as a diversion to evacuate personell so the data could be corrupted to prevent a public lab from discovering the government created the virus in the first place! I sorta laugh now, because besides some irc ranting, I sent an email to the national enquirer about it, but never heard back. There weren&#39;t many conspiracy forums back then.</p>

<p>Haven&#39;t really seen much about it since then, except for Fletcher Prouty mentioning it in a video or two. </p>

<p>BTW, if you haven&#39;t heard of Fletcher Prouty, take the time to view some of the videos of him on youtube. Great stuff.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>i prefer conspiracies based primarily in reality. reading &#39;woo&#39; conspiracies involving alien overlords and secret satanic pedo cults that intertwine literally every person above the middle class is amusing and all, but extremely unlikely and all based on shaky sources, conjecture, subjective/anecdotal &#39;facts&#39; and theories from a lot of people who aren&#39;t exactly mentally stable. the fact is most of these huge conspiracies are self-contradicting and have so much conflicting information by the people who perpetuate and spew them that it would hard to believe any of it is true, especially when a lot of the things they claim to be able to do is physically impossible.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good question. After learning about the nephilim I read the Bible with a different perspective. Not trying to impose my opinion.....just explain since you asked. I think ailiens can be demonic and angelic. I think ailiens can be good and evil. Just like humans. We are all parts of gods creation even demons. The fallen ones are out to manipulate and enslave us. The Bible says the devil came to rob steal and destroy. There is a story about 3 blind men describing an elephant. They each describe one part and they are all different and contradict each other but they are all right. So I think the ancients were more literally right than we give them credit for. When I was growing up I was told the Bible was symbolic, now I think it is probably more literal. heaven is another word for universe. Maybe Jesus was from the universe not from a symbolic happy place. But from an advanced evolved world where evil is not in control.? </p>

<p>Trump got access to his uncle&#39;s inheritance, which included all of Tesla&#39;s original research notes since Trump&#39;s uncle was the scientist tasks with categorizing his original research.</p>

<p>He&#39;s clearly used technology far beyond our grasp to modify the timeline in what I believe to be the opening shots of a temporal war with elites from the distant future.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah man i know what they did making us seem like loons. When i said wrong i mean’t you have the wrong idea about fe and chemtrails. I know they are hard to believe but do your research on it. If you are on the side that they arent real set out to prove your view wrong with info from the other side. The flat earth is real, elites (freemasons, zionists, etc.) know its real and they worship the devil. </p>

<p>We are lied to all the time because we are being taught the exact opposite of what is real. You need to see that all of this is anti-God and anti-good. No one can dispute chemtrails because they are infact real. Contrails are tiny trails of water vapour from plane engines that aren&#39;t very visible and disappear quickly, where as chemtrails are a concoction of aluminium and barium and one other metal i forget the name of. This is all an effort to destroy God&#39;s creation. Aluminium isnt good for us, they put it in the vaccines, it&#39;s in our water and our food is grown with it, not to mention the deception that is fluoride. Soil has been tested in areas with chemtrails and its at exponential rates than should be. This kills plants and is paving the way for Monsanto&#39;s gmo aluminium resistant seeds to be the only way to grow food. </p>

<p>This world is run by secret societies filled with psychopaths who only want destruction (this is anti-creation, death). They are playing everyone like fools but even worse they are playing God.</p>
