       You may have found yourself being called a paid shill and wonder "wtf? I wish I was getting paid!"
      </p>
      <p>
       There are 3 types of people here, conspiracy theorists, paid shills and parrots. Parrots are people who make comments on subjects they know little to nothing about and only repeat the official stories fed to them. A person who makes an idiotic circular comment like "jet fuel can't melt steel beams" are parrots, ignore them.
      </p>
      <p>
       These people are the reasons sheeple is an insult to sheep, in the words of David Icke "sheep need a dog to herd them, people herd each other" and that's what these parrots do. They want to come across as intelligent and the way idiots achieve this is by repeating the words of the people they deem to be intelligent or more to the point, the people they have been told to listen to.
      </p>
      <p>
       School teaches us to copy and repeat in this very same way, it's beaten into us to be this way. So how do we solve the problem?
      </p>
      <p>
       Make then explain, not with links or sources, ask them questions. If they respond angrily then bingo, parrot. parrots hate being held to the flames because they only know what MSM has told them. These people are worse then paid shills.
      </p>
      <p>
       But to find them you have to ask yourself before commenting "do I actually know what I'm saying?"

       I don't think that's what he's said at all though.
      </p>
      <p>
       He actually goes into more detail further down in the comment:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>

       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       While it's a bit extreme, I agree with the general idea of what he's saying. If somebody can't actually explain their thought process/reasoning behind a certain stance (that happens to be a popular one), then they
       <em>
        are
       </em>
       a parrot. This applies in all topics in life.
      </p>
      <p>
       I really don't think it's fair that you have replied to this post in this way. You're putting words in his mouth. Lots of people jump straight to the comments when they open such threads and you seem to be trying to derail this one with a bit of a strawman reply, in all honesty.

       by limiting the avenues which you can pursue to provide proof, you're intentionally trying to curtail the fact-based truth from coming out. providing links or sources is a GOOD thing, it means there's actual SCIENCE behind what you say. to try to stop empirical proof from coming to the fore is extremely anti-intellectual. maybe being PC and beating around the bush (by simply implying the OP is shallow instead of coming out and saying it) is the right way to go about things, but i can understand the frustration.

       it definitely appears to me like what Rockran said is correct.

       No, anyone who only repeats headlines and cannot base an argument beyond that is a parrot or a shill. But the post does say this. Selective reading taking place.

       Provide evidence in support of climate change. I guess we know because before mankind existed there must have been a bloke saying "hey guys, this is the bar, we start here". I've watched both Bill Nye and Tyson make idiots out of themselves talking about climate change because it cannot be proven. However we shouldn't need an excuse to help the planet.

       Pulling gas, coal and oil out of the ground and burning them for fuel adds into the already present gases in the atmosphere. That's the only proof that is needed to say we should be getting on with a different fuel source other than fossil fuels.

       That's not how your OP states. It states to talk it out so let's talk it out. Why do you have the belief that burning fossil fuels does not put extra chemicals into the atmosphere and subsequently doesn't add into climate change? I don't need sources, I want your opinion. (Just please don't say 'carbon tax' and / or CO2 is good for plants... Because I have a retort for both lol)

       You seem to think it's a myth so I am asking how you have came to that conclusion. No sources. Just you and that brain of yours : )
      </p>
      <p>
       I know for a fact that during every mass extinction event, the atmospheric conditions changed which resulted in an ice age. There is data world wide to 'prove' that.
      </p>
      <p>
       I want to know how you have came to your ridiculous speculation that man is not add excess chemicals into the atmosphere which will not push us towards climate change? Saying 'it can't be proven' can be said for most, if not all conspiracies so that is a false statement (especially regarding humans output into the atmosphere and Earths history regarding the changes in atmospheric conditions concluding to an ice age.)
      </p>
      <p>
       I want to know your thoughts, not just disbelief. I don't believe in certain things but I still have my own thoughts about them : )

       You are asking me how I came to a speculation, that has boggled my mind. The answer is in the word speculate. I don't think anything about climate change, I just think we should do something about it regardless. So I don't understand what you are asking me. As you said the atmospheric conditions change during every mass extinction event, prove that this time is any different. :)

       What, do you just disbelieve everything or something along those lines? There must be a reason why you disbelieve that burning fossil fuels adds extra chemicals into the atmosphere which will push us towards climate change therefore next ice age will be sooner.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nothing can be done to stop climate change. Trying to stop it could fuck up the planet big time. The Earth goes through cycles so it essentially needs to happen (who knows WTF would happen if the cycles didn't conclude.)

       There is no 'proof' for what you asked for but I do believe that there could be a Mass Extinction Event on our hands in the future. Hopefully not in my lifetime but who knows...

       So you don't believe because there is no 'proof'? When there is plenty of 'proof' to suggest that the atmosphere changes before an ice age. We are certainly adding into the atmosphere so I fail to see how you have formed your opinion and would like to know what your thoughts on climate change, pollution and ice ages and why you disbelieve we are contributing to the atmospheric conditions. No proof doesn't cut it for me. There's not proof of much of the shit that's spoke about on this sub. Why is human made climate change false?

       See I don't need to explain as I have already told you, my opinion on global warming is that I don't have an opinion. I don't know how much clearer I need to be. I don't need an opinion on it. The point of my post is to question people when they make comments about certain topics they know nothing about. You made the comment on global warming so I asked you the questions, you didn't have any answers because you know nothing about it therefore proving the point of my post. So thanks :)

       Everyone has an opinion, especially regarding pollution from fuels going into the atmosphere. All I'm trying to do is find out how and why you have came to your conclusion. I haven't accused you of being angry. I just said take your own advice lol and answer questions that you are biting at. I have explained what I think I know, so explain what you think you know about it. Having 'no opinion' and 'no proof' doesn't work for me.

       And as I have repeated numerous times I have no opinion on it, but I think we shouldn't argue about it because it will help the planet and that's not a bad thing. I have said this since the beginning yet you can't seem to comprehend it. You seem to be making a lot of assumptions and none of them are correct. You keep saying I came to a conclusion, I'd love to know what conclusion you think I have come to considering I have never stated anything of the like. You made a claim, I asked for proof, it's not my fault you are unable to provide it. That doesn't mean I do or do not believe in climate change. It makes no difference what works for you or not, just because you can't understand it doesn't mean you are right.

       I never asked for a discussion regarding climate change, you did. I've stated numerous times an opinion is not needed from me on the subject. I don't think one way or the other and I think we should do something about it regardless. That is the last time I will type that so if you think you need to reply just read all of my responses for the same answer I've given since the start to your same question that you have asked about ten times.

       You retorted to my original statement so you must've wanted a discussion. You wanted sources for me to 'prove' myself (which went against your OP) and I have been trying to find out what your thoughts and opinions are about man affecting climate change.

       I have answered the question with my first response. And asking for a source isn't....why am I even bothering? All you have done is ask me the same questions i answered from the start. Maybe you should go back and read the post because you clearly mixed the point completely. I've not denied climate change, I merely stated there is no proof, you were unable to provide any evidence of any kind. The point of my post is people talking about topics they actually know nothing about, neither of us know anything about climate change as evident by the responses which is why I refuse to discuss it. Users like you were the point, and you have proven it for me.

       Your OP says not to ask for sources so you are going against your own post lol
      </p>
      <p>
       All I am doing is asking if you think humans affect the climate or not. Yes or no answer. Doesn't matter about proof or sources, I want your opinion since you are harassing me for sources to prove myself (when your OP says to ask questions, which you have failed to do but you went against your OP and started asking for sources to back myself up.)

       Do humans affect the climate with burning fuels?

       I didn't ask for a source I asked for evidence which you failed to supply me with. You're not doing a good job at twisting my words I must say. All I'm doing is telling you I don't care either way, it's a none issue if we try and prevent it anyway which is what I suggested. Have a nice day.

       Burning fuels releases trapped chemicals into the atmosphere. It's that simple. If you want to stick your fingers in your ears and not answer and questions so be it

       What would be a reasonable standard of proof for you?
      </p>
      <p>
       There's plenty of evidence to show that global climate temperatures have risen dramatically over the past couple hundred years (since we started burning fossil fuels), far beyond the rates of the previous few millenia.
      </p>
      <p>
       Are you suggesting that this data is wrong, or that it doesn't represent a continuing trend?
      </p>
      <p>
       Fact is, there is evidence suggesting such a trend. By all means, refute it and we can return to a state of complete ambiguity.

       According to the original posters logic, any scientist that agrees with climate change that hasn't studied it them self is a "parrot".  I think "climate change" has become political talking point and is now a source of tax revenue here in Canada. How about we  make a plan to pollute less in all forms? Nope the government can't figure a way to profit from that. There are cities that drop sewage straight into rivers, that would be a good place to start.

       I agree and I also believe if there is a good reason there should be no debate. The planet can only benefit from us trying to prevent climate change and worse case scenario we are wrong and the world is better off.

       Good post!
      </p>
      <p>
       Many people also can't differentiate between opinion and facts.
That's something I find most frustrating. Like, here are the facts and the only response is, but it's just your opinion man. No, it's not. With different facts I'd have a different opinion. Is that so hard to grasp? Guess it is, because most choose a side and stay on it till it crumbles and fall, no matter the facts. Like a fucking cult.

       I like parroting, it has a more meaningful way for the analogy we're using it fro. Sheeps are way too fluffy and cute and can't harm anyone.

       The ones pushed by government and msm that contradict with evidence. For example: the official 9/11 story is that terrorists hijacked planes with boxcutters and flew them into the twin towers and pentagon because they "hate America's freedoms".

       But also don't be so quick to discard msm news. There is a hard propaganda push from the right to discredit anything and anyone who dares to criticize their master, trump. Be careful you don't simply jump on a bandwagon they are driving just because you find flaws in the press (which has always had them).

       Oh don't worry, I recognise the bias from all sides. I don't disregard any media though. I acknowledge it, compare it to what other media outlets say, try to form the best idea of truth based on what resources I have at my disposal. There's pushes from both the hard right, hard left, neo-liberals, and every "side", and that's because "sides" are controlled. There are no sides in the end. Just differing philosophies and ideologies. Politics should be about taking different aspects of these ideologies and applying them where most relevant to better the greater society. Problem is it's been hijacked and drilled into the minds of the people that politics is about choosing a box to put yourself in and pushing for only that forever. Politics don't account for the very nature of the universe - change. Practicing ideologies is problematic as ideologies don't plan for their own inevitable, eventual obsoletion.

       OP you have it all wrong. There are three types of people: dicks, pussies, and assholes. If you aren't a dick you're probably getting fucked.
      </p>
      <p>
       Pussies don't like dicks because pussies get fucked by dicks. But dicks also fuck assholes. Assholes that just want to shit on everything. Pussies may think they can deal with assholes their way. But the only thing that can fuck a asshole is a dick, with some balls. The problem with dicks is they fuck too much or fuck when it isn't appropriate. And it takes a pussy to show them that. But sometimes pussies can be so full of shit that they become assholes themselves. Because pussies are a inch and half away from assholes. I don't know much about this crazy crazy world, but I do know this. If you don't let us fuck this asshole we're going to have our dicks and pussies all covered in shit.

       You forgot the fourth type:  The open minded skeptic.  Those who want to believe, but in some cases (flat earth) find it hard to do so, and instead ask for non affiliated sources that back up theories. Whether that's scientific reasoning (flat earth as an example), or independent witnesses and sources not aligned with any one agenda.

       That is not proof, those are words. I'm glad I made this thread, a few people who have commented have been a fantastic example of parrots.

       I never asked for a discussion regarding climate change, you did. I've stated numerous times an opinion is not needed from me on the subject. I don't think one way or the other and I think we should do something about it regardless. That is the last time I will type that so if you think you need to reply just read all of my responses for the same answer I've given since the start to your same question that you have asked about ten times.
