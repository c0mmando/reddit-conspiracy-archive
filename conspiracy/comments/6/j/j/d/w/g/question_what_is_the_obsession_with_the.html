    <div class="md"><p>The people who yell at people for not going along with the &quot;gay agenda&quot; are idiots themselves. They are just as &quot;closed minded&quot; as the people they are persecuting. For instance the cake store who wouldn&#39;t sell cakes to gay couples. Just go somewhere else, who cares? Write a review on yelp if you&#39;re so angry this is a capitalistic society. The cake place that sells more cakes will prosper while the one who sells less won&#39;t, or they can both sell cakes who cares it&#39;s their store. There are tons of gay people who also feel that way. We&#39;re just told by the media who try to divide us that it is the way you feel when it&#39;s not when you start talking to individuals one on one were just being divided by the MSM who sensationalise stories to where the outcome is people are taken to court because they didn&#39;t want to bake a cake.</p>

<p>How big does a group have to be to make it stop being OK for a place of public accommodation to discriminate against them? Would you say it was a &quot;who cares&quot; event if a bakery had a sign that said &quot;Due to our religious faith we refuse to serve Black people&quot;?</p>

<p>I mean, think about it:  do you really want some anti-gay person <em>making a cake for your wedding day</em>!? </p>

<p>Honestly, I have no interest in forcing people to do business with me or socialize with me if they would rather not.  The only exception here should be businesses that have virtual monopolies for critical products or services (e.g. pharmacies, large medical clinics that dominate a geographical region).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly. If such a small percentage of the population is transgender, why the big focus on it in the media? It&#39;s not like people are gravitating to it--the Caitlyn Jenner show flopped, &quot;Transparent&quot; has awards but low rating, that show about the trans teen and her doll don&#39;t get watch and don&#39;t sell. </p>

<p>There&#39;s a reason you don&#39;t see movies starring trans characters--no Hollywood studio will finance it because they know it will bomb. On TV, they can force it down your eyeballs and hope it takes. </p>

<p>This is about Baphomet, fucking with the consciousness of the citizenry, leading as many souls astray as possible. </p>

<p>Being transgender is a mental disorder for which we should have empathy and pity. Mockery and violence are wrong. But glorification or normalization are also wrong. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The issue is that people who are not / should not be transgender are being subtly coerced into believing that they <em>are</em> transgender.  For example, socially awkward teenagers, especially those who would, in a different generation, grow up to be an ordinary, garden-variety homosexual, are now being encouraged to go down a path of extreme medical regimens and life-altering, mutilating surgeries. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Feminisation of males is what it says it is. Males being less masculine and more feminine, which can be done through hormones (more so when it&#39;s unintentional since &#39;the pill&#39; puts estrogen into the water supply) and even society helps with feminisation of males. Fake tan, make up, mirror watching. Female traits.</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t say &#39;I think&#39; the world will turn 50%&#39;, I said even if it did go as low as that it would still have a major effect on the population. All I&#39;m saying is the higher the number the worse it is for the human race, same with homosexuality. </p>

<p>Again, where the fuck did you get the figure 10% of males are gay? There is no way to determine that shit. So you are saying there is about 3.5 million gay guys in the world?</p>

<p>Here is an article that goes into percentages of homosexuality in the US and they give past estimates as well. It&#39;s WaPo I know but I just googled real quick.</p>

<p>So what I&#39;m getting here is not that actual gender reassignment surgery but that gender roles are put in place for procreation of a species and if you mess with gender roles that also messes with men wanting to have sex with women and in that it slows down the production of the human species becaus men are wearing make up and fake tan and looking at themselves in the mirror and that&#39;s all that women should be doing. Also that men will stop wanting to have sex with women because they have more estrogen in their body? Do you know how hormones work and how attraction works for sexual intercourse. Testosterone and estrogen do not determine if you want to have sex with men or women. If this were true then all straight female body builders who took large amounts of testosterone to change facial and body structure are now gay, which just is not the case. The reason transgendered people use hormone replacement is to lose or gain breast or to soften or tone muscle and skin.</p>

<p>Why are you defending the feminisation of males?

    <div class="md"><p>I just really don&#39;t think you understand how hormones work. I think you should read up on what testosterone and estrogen do and the reason your body produces one or the other. Because estrogen does not make you use spray tan and look in a mirror. That&#39;s all I&#39;m saying here. I understand where you&#39;re coming from but a lot of your conclusions also come from a lack of medical knowledge when it comes to hormones in the body and their effect on it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Feminisation of males is what it says it is. Males being less masculine and more feminine, which can be done through hormones (more so when it&#39;s unintentional since &#39;the pill&#39; puts estrogen into the water supply) and even society helps with feminisation of males. Fake tan, make up, mirror watching. Female traits.&quot;</p>

<p>I see so here you&#39;re saying that the hormones will cause men to grow breast and have softer features while. Then society makes them wear fake tan and look in the mirror. Then they turn gay? Is that from the estrogen or looking in the mirror that turns them gay? Even if a transgendered person does not cut off their penis they are still straight are they not? They will still use their penis to impregnate a women. So where in this does the population stop. Cause again giving someone too much testosterone or estrogen doesn&#39;t turn people gay it doesn&#39;t work like that. If that were true then all gay body builders who use large huge amounts of testosterone would be straight after.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Subliminal messaging is very powerful and can be used to do a whole multitude of things. I really wouldn&#39;t be surprised if it can be used to alter what someone is attracted to. A bit like me I suppose, I have a couple of fetishes which was created through society, so I do know it is possible...</p>

<p>You keep putting words in my mouth so I am really starting to wonder about you... If someone is trans, it doesn&#39;t mean they are gay but it would certainly be harder to find a healthy relationship to be in, where a woman would accept a trans (she would need to be gay.) Not all body builders use testosterone suppliments. What I am trying to say (but it seems to get lost) is that it is a combination of mutiple things added together that would help to screw up the brain and make people either have fetishes, be gay or trans.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nah man I&#39;m going to apologize I re read out conversation. I get that you&#39;re saying that sexuality is on a spectrum of gay to straight like the Kinsey scale and in that because a majority of people are sexually fluid with who they are attracted to they can be influenced into what turns them on sexually. But you can also see that national or ethnic culture does that already the idea of the ideal female or male body varies country to country there are infographs you can look at to see this. I understand now where you are coming from I get it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Let me try to explain myself one more time and I will now out.
I failed to make the point earlier... </p>

<p>From a biblical (religious standpoint) this is the ultimate manifestation of the battle between good and  evil.</p>

<p>TPTB (evil) are sending a message that in order to attain your optimum form you must alter your body with surgeries and hormones as someone else put it.</p>

<p>They make this option attractive by using celebrities to push the idea but ultimately they want to alter Gid&#39;s creation.
Why? Because the satanic elites hate us and they want us to go to hell. 
The devil and his minions know that at the end of days they will be cast into the lake of fire and they figure the more of us they&#39;re are the less the will burn so they want to deceive us into sinning.</p>

<p>One version I have heard of the endgame (as I understand) is to alter the human genome.</p>

<p>Currently geneticists are treating aging as a &quot;disease.&quot; 
They are trying to change our genetic code so that we will no longer be God&#39;s creation and instead be an abomination. 
At which l point we may not be eligible for God&#39;s eternal gift of Heaven because we are no longer human. 
Okay. I&#39;ll stop </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe that there is a stronger agenda as well, when you hear about the stories of the parents who are telling their young children that they are trans just because their daughter wants to play army or their son likes Barbie. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve read one story where they even c introduced their child as the opposite gender whenever they meet people. I think that a child shouldn&#39;t have anything like that decided for them and I think they should need to wait till they are at least 18 to make any life alerting decisions around procedures. </p>

<p>It&#39;s okay to be confused about sexuality, it&#39;s okay to truly be trans (regardless of personal religious beliefs), it&#39;s not okay to force children who don&#39;t know what the hell is going on into a life path they might never have wanted</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You can take anything you don&#39;t like or understand that is &quot;other&quot; to what you know and get and frame it as a grand conspiracy being perpetrated in order to cause harm. If you just go around calling trans people freaks who shouldn&#39;t exist, you&#39;re just gonna look like a bigoted asshole. Better to turn it into some type of devious scheme being perpetrated against the decent, &quot;normal&quot; people. I imagine those who promote transgenderism as an evil conspiracy probably just don&#39;t understand/hate transgenderism as a concept. </p>

<p>This has been done in response to essentially every social movement, by the way. Trans people having rights like everyone else isn&#39;t really a social movement so much as a campaign for acceptance, part of the goal maybe being less trans people will be murdered or ostracized or reduced to simply being &quot;mentally ill.&quot; A similar thing happened when being openly gay was across-the-board illegal and conversion therapy, always religious-based, was a thing.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Family&quot; should not be in quotations. It&#39;s a real thing that everyone who is born has, regardless of whether they are good family or not.</p>

<p>Babies are born by women. Men inseminate women in order to make babies. This is the difference in genders. Women have to spend their lives caring for the babies, regardless of whether or not she is supported. I don&#39;t care what people want to do in their own lives, but i do believe the trans/pseudo-fem movement is a direct attack on the classic Sacred Feminine and Masculine traits that create good family units. </p>

<p>If you think about it, the feminist movement itself is doublespeak, or newspeak. There is nothing &quot;feminine&quot; about the movement at all. It&#39;s not asking for women to be treated equally when they are in the home, caring for their children and husband. It&#39;s asking for women who act like men to be treated equally as men. The benefit for the government and corporatocracy is 1) get to lower wages/more labor competition within the workplace 2) govt gets to collect double payroll taxes with 2 workers instead of 1 3) with both parents busy at work the state gets to raise your child in endless daycare and public schooling - preparing them to replace their parents like a cog in the corporate workplace once they are used up. Win win win.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is exactly correct.</p>

<p>I&#39;m a gay guy and I strongly believe that gay men and lesbians should be allowed sexual, romantic fulfillment (with one person in a committed monogamous relationship).  However, we are really a small minority.  Most people are heterosexual, and should be encouraged to form <em>healthy</em> families where children grow up with the proper emotional support from both parents.  </p>

<p>All of the cultural messaging in the last 30-40 years has been the opposite of this, incentivizing broken families and emotionally traumatized children.</p>

<p>So my inclination is to agree with people who are concerned about the breakup of the nuclear family, but I wish they&#39;d get off their high horse about gay people.  We are not the problem.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think majority of people give a flying toot what other people do in their own home. Except for the minority of high-horse religious folks who feel it&#39;s their duty to warn everyone about hell, I think most generally religious people would agree. I think that just as someone else here said the media is blowing the gay/trans perspective out of proportion, I think they may also be blowing the religious/anti-gay perspective out of proportion as well. Divide and conquer, eh?</p>

<p>Pretty much.  </p>

<p>My in-laws are devout Christians, and I love them dearly.  They&#39;re fine with me, and appreciate that I make their son happy.  I think they may have an issue around same-sex marriage in the abstract, so we&#39;re on the down-low about the fact that we&#39;re legally married, but other than that everything works pretty smoothly.  (I&#39;m not crazy about the idea of same-sex &quot;marriage&quot;, as I think the organizing principle around marriage in the religious sense should be preparation of the next generation, but the bundle of tax, property and inheritance rights that comes with civil marriage in the US should be available to all couples, and right now &quot;marriage&quot; is the only way to secure them.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The people who yell at people for not going along with the &quot;gay agenda&quot; are idiots themselves. They are just as &quot;closed minded&quot; as the people they are persecuting. For instance the cake store who wouldn&#39;t sell cakes to gay couples. Just go somewhere else, who cares? Write a review on yelp if you&#39;re so angry this is a capitalistic society. The cake place that sells more cakes will prosper while the one who sells less won&#39;t, or they can both sell cakes who cares it&#39;s their store. There are tons of gay people who also feel that way. We&#39;re just told by the media who try to divide us that it is the way you feel when it&#39;s not when you start talking to individuals one on one were just being divided by the MSM who sensationalise stories to where the outcome is people are taken to court because they didn&#39;t want to bake a cake.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just really don&#39;t think you understand how hormones work. I think you should read up on what testosterone and estrogen do and the reason your body produces one or the other. Because estrogen does not make you use spray tan and look in a mirror. That&#39;s all I&#39;m saying here. I understand where you&#39;re coming from but a lot of your conclusions also come from a lack of medical knowledge when it comes to hormones in the body and their effect on it.</p>
