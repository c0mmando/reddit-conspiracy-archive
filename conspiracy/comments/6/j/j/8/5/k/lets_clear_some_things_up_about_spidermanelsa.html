<li><p>There are no proven links to Pizzagate</p></li>
<li><p>There is no proven motive behind all this (except money of course)</p></li>
<li><p>There are several groups making these from all over the world, east Asian and places in the west seem most prominent. ( I made a previous thread talking about one of the Vietnamese groups before and I will link it at the end.)</p></li>
<li><p>This is not as prominent on the kids app as it is made out to be.  There is a shit load of questionable content but, speaking for myself, I could not find the worst offenders on the kids app when I checked for myself.  Still lots of weird syringe/injection stuff and things people might consider as children in inappropriate situations.  I welcome any evidence that contradicts my own brief experience.  (Evidence as in screenshots/videos not anecdotes)</p></li>
</ul>

<p>This does not mean we should not investigate the issue.  I&#39;m sure many, if not most, parents are not even aware of the YT Kids app because the YT app is bundled with all Android phones so why would most people even bother looking?  I think a lot of the anecdotes we are hearing about people catching their children/relatives watching these videos are coming from the fact that they are using the regular YT app. Once again, this does not mean we should drop the investigation. </p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC_mFqVgheE">Supposedly Youtube is implementing restrictions in monetizing these videos.
</a> although through personal research I can tell you this either has not yet taken effect or it is complete lipservice.  My bet is on the latter.</p></li>
<li><p>I found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj33gZDObOo">these</a> two <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIknzuGDU2k">videos</a> from a year ago to be suspicious personally.  No actual evidence is given for us to view why this guy backed off.  The channel in question (Toy Monster) seems to be one of the more innocuous ones but the autoplays lead directly to the crazy and inappropriate things.  </p></li>
</ul>

<p>I have focused my own research into the Spiderman and Elsa trend. I know there are other things out there that are hugely questionable (understatement of the century) including one channel that is mentioned several times that shows up on the kids app quite often.  It seems they are using different thumbnails for the kids app than normal Youtube.  Or maybe that specific video isn&#39;t on the kids app.</p>

<p>Either way my goal here is to clear up some disinformation/misinformation going around.  I have not even mentioned the weird Russian kidnapping/injection videos, the actual CP that was allegedly found (I say allegedly because I have not and will not view the evidence), the disgusting comments in the videos featuring children, or the view botting that seems to be going on.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6j64g4/vietnamese_spidermanelsa_channels_and_their/">As promised the link to my previous thread on what I found researching the Vietnamese videos.</a></p>

<p>I would like to encourage everyone to investigate as far as you are comfortable with.  That is certainly what I have been doing and there are others doing the same.  If you know of a discord to discuss this please let me know as I would like to find a group investigating this and join up if possible.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is a bizarre thread. If you wanted to come across as an agent for shadowy collecvives, then you nailed it. </p>

<p>There are plenty of folks who actually saw their kids watching these videos. Some of the worst ones involving needles, scat, impregnation were also viewed. This is a deceitful thread. Why have the videos not been taken down or at least curbed intensively? Why are they still viewable even after child locks are set in place? Why have we not received any decent answers for why they even exist? All of the answers I have heard generally suck terribly and insulted what little intelligence I had. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is what I want to find out.  Why they are there, why the disgusting comments, why the wildly inappropriate themes, and why nothing has been done about it despite Youtube employees themselves stating that monetization is going away for these videos.  </p>

<p>I gave my personal experience from trying out the kids app tonight and looking for these specific videos and themes.  I even said in the thread that I found <strong>some</strong> but not all of them.  These are the facts, the ones that can be proven with empirical evidence.  I said in the end that I have left a lot out because my focus has been on the Spiderman and Elsa videos.  </p>

<p>If I had the time I could go out and get the evidence to make this thread five times as long as it is with the other allegations that have evidence but, unfortunately, I have bills to pay and sanity to maintain.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Alright. I think it just came across as a thread that is trying to downplay and minimize these videos. I think it definitely is great for people to be as unbiased as possible, and we do definitely get stuck in our own confirmation biases at times. It is good to have a healthy skepticism when doing investigations, but also when you have shit as blatant as this and nothign is being done, it can be touchy ground to go on.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The videos are obviously subversive and disturbing at best. Many are obviously verging on the pornographic. Kids have seen these, even the worst of them. They have been floating around for years and have been reported by many thousands for years and nothing happens. Disney and Marvel have been tipped, google and youtube have been tipped. Nothing has happened. No definitive answers have been given, though a few folks have come up with some fairly decent ideas of what is behind all this. Some of the videos obviously required hundreds or thousands of dollars to shoot. Bit actors were hired, and shadowy producers are paying people to make this garbage. There are strange ties to the art world (which lately has had a fetish/fixation on MKultra and &quot;Monarch&quot; style programming. These are not just made by Bradburry types, but from strange folks from around the world. It is not just a money making scheme.</p>
