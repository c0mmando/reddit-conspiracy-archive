    <div class="md"><p>Thing is, the perfect example of someone who is ~~ a conspiracy theorist~~ &quot;woke&quot; or conscious is someone who you will not find on this subreddit. There may be a few you may find who have been here for a long time but the majority of refugees to this sub in the last 2 years consist of people too unwilling to be open to everything and trust no one. These people here are inclined to align to a specific &quot;side&quot; so they feel a sense of belonging, but really the best sense of belonging is belonging to yourself. People are afraid to let go of their political, racial, economical, etc. stances and alliances and therefore they are not really true patriots of modern day. The true patriots are those who possess a higher state of consciousness and already know that these &quot;sides&quot; such as Republican vs Democrat, Black vs White, etc are just strategies enforced by higher, evil powers used to divide and conquer the people for the very reason that we don&#39;t wake up against &quot;them&quot;. Unity scares them and I can say that they are very scared now. We are in the age of information. More people than ever are waking up but that power of awakness must be used in unity across the world to completely end the rule by the evil powers that be. </p>

These people here are inclined to align to a specific &quot;side&quot; so they feel a sense of belonging, but really the best sense of belonging is belonging to yourself. People are afraid to let go of their political, racial, economical, etc. stances and alliances and therefore they are not really true patriots of modern day. The true patriots are those who possess a higher state of consciousness and already know that these &quot;sides&quot; such as Republican vs Democrat, Black vs White, etc are just strategies enforced by higher, evil powers used to divide and conquer the people for the very reason that we don&#39;t wake up against &quot;them&quot;. Unity scares them and I can say that they are very scared now. We are in the age of information.

<p>You don&#39;t have to even know what the official story is to take the &quot;rational&quot; position on 9/11. The same goes for any number of other issues. They think you can become rational by virtue signalling and don&#39;t realize their intellect is being rigidly controlled through peer pressure.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Haha. This is a question I admittedly fear sometimes. Luckily most people never ask it.</p>

<p>Something I tend to do if I want to ask myself how certain I am of something is, I ask myself how much I would risk on the assumption that I am right. </p>

<p>Am I so convinced that I am right that I would risk my life? </p>

<p>For example, when I climb over a deep abyss, I must be 99.999% certain that the force that pulls me down (what we call gravity) will not suddenly increase.</p>

<p>If I am convinced enough that something is true, I figure, I would be willing to risk my life upon the assumption that I am right. </p>

<p>Note: This does not include things like &quot;Are you willing to give your life if this jury finds that you have been wrong?&quot;, because at that point the to-be-validated truth would no longer be the truth in itself but the assumption &quot;The jury will agree with me&quot;.</p>

<p>The rate at which people are beginning to see the power construct for what it is has been increasing exponentially.

    <div class="md"><p>There was ZERO choice last election.  Bernie is a fraud.  How do I know?  I volunteered for his campaign.  While his supporters were calling out the obvious cheating, favoritism, and fraud of the media and election officials he declared that &quot;The DNC treated me fairly&quot;.  Now he is silent on the DNC lawsuit brought by lawyers for his donors.</p>

<p>This sub sees both parties as different departments of the ONE Party system that deceives and oppresses us.  If you support either party then you are part of the problem.</p>

I&#39;m upset you think the Democrats would do anything different from the GOP, besides being more friendly towards minorities.  You can forget Hillary but you cannot forget the Democrats.  It&#39;s because they offer no real difference that we have Trump.</p>

<p>The pedophile bullshit, the clintons smuggling cocaine and killing a bunch of people along the way.... not bullshit.. </p>

<p>trump and putin may have some type of cahoots going on but as far as I can tell.. its to try and fight the shadow government that is run by Israel and currently controls a vast majority of the worlds countries, military and citizens. </p>
