<p>There is ABC reporting it at 12:45 pm. Well outside the window that the person claimed. As it was supposed to start around 2 &quot;on Twitter&quot; and then be picked up by the media. </p>

<p>Odds are that 4chan/pol just choose Friday because that&#39;s when breaking news always comes out, and 2 - 5 pm is the prime window for breaking news to gain views and traction. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The story broke here on the 7pm news. If it broke earlier in the US, its probably because stories like this from the US, arent really as important to the MSM in Europe and rarely make the headlines. </p>

<p>So yes, for me it broke at 2pm eastern.</p>

<p>It still doesnt go anyway to suggest that Lynch is what that anon/larper was on about. Just that, for me at least, it was in the correct time frame.</p>

<p>What part of that sentence have you got the problem with?</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The Lynch announcement hit Europe at about 7pm
It did (notice the word &#39;about&#39;).</p></li>
<li><p>which is 2pm eastern
It is.</p></li>
<li><p>So the timing was spot on
The Anon said the story would break sometime BEFORE 2pm <a href="http://boards.4chan.org/pol/thread/131053896#p131070438">http://boards.4chan.org/pol/thread/131053896#p131070438</a></p></li>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>So the White House anon was talking only to Europeans on 4chan?</p>

<p>The story broke before 2pm, it broke from ABC on the internet. </p>

<p>It didn&#39;t break just before 2 pm on Twitter, then get picked up immediately by cable news as per Anon&#39;s prediction. </p>

<p>Your point at &quot;around 2 pm&quot; is fair enough, but the time the story hit Europe on your TV news has nothing to do with anything unless you are assuming the White House leaker is communicating with Europeans as his/her main audience in mind. </p>

<p>And regardless, it seems we&#39;re both arguing a moot point because Anon claims it was &quot;between now and no later than 2 pm.&quot; I had thought it said &quot;around and no later than 2 pm.&quot; </p>

<p>So either way debating over the relevance of the 2pm timeframe seems insignificant.</p>

<p>OK something was announced, we would have got the announcement anyways, he didn&#39;t give us anything extra.</p>

<p>What is supposed to happen is he is supposed to give us a bunch of inside info / insight into what is going on that he may not be able to provide direct proof for, but as proof that he is truly an insider and not some kid making up stories, then he tells us that tomorrow a big story will drop and say something like &quot;look for the L&#39;s&quot; Then we could give weight to the other things he said.</p>
