Why do they encourage this behavior, the destruction of the family structure? Its hard enough that no job pays livable wages, but to then take away more just for trying to raise a family? </p>

With divorce rates more likely than not divorcing, your degree will be the one thing that can&#39;t be lost in a divorce agreement.</p>

<p>But good luck with everything.  :). It is nice to see a couple with their heads on together.</p>

<p>Now that gay marriage is a thing though, employers will not cover your partner on health insurance unless you&#39;re married.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Democratic Party created the welfare state , (Franklin D Rosevelt Great Depression,)generations of families on welfare with no way to break the cycle , the people have come to rely on and expect benefits. Welfare and benefits are a great way to keep people from owning anything and keep US citizens dependent on the government . The US government wants to have full control over you , by accepting welfare, food stamps and benefits you are furthering that control. Welfare is supposed to be temporary but people tend to stay on for years , can you blame them? Free money on top of under the table earnings fuck it&#39;s a god damn game and some just know how to play it better than others . &quot;It&#39;s hard enough that no job pays livable wages&quot; this right here is a myth there are plenty of jobs out there that pay plenty  it&#39;s just people want it now and don&#39;t know how to work and don&#39;t want to stoop to a level that is unbecoming of them everyone feels they should make $100k a year doing as little as possible because they are entitled to it . Five years ago I was broke living in the streets no car nothing I was fucked was about to kill myself  ( I didn&#39;t get on benefits my pride wouldn&#39;t let me ) instead I got an hourly job in the trades  10 an hour, would get punked half the time and not get paid (shady fucking business owners) one day i decided I was done and would never rely on anyone for my survival , so I started my own business 2 years later and thousands upon thousand of hours of labor I bought a house in the burbs , last December I bought a full size luxury truck , last night while eating sashimi dinner with my porn star looking gf while wearing my $1000 gold chain I realized how much time I have sacrificed to be able to afford such luxuries and if I can do it ( and keep in mind I&#39;m a fucking loser by design) anyone can do it if they just get off their fucking ass and go . </p>

<p>&quot;Single&quot; and &quot;Married filing Separately&quot; have the same rates unless you make over $233,500 a year. </p>

<p>Whether you are single or married, the federal government and most states provide you with tax breaks and incentives for having a child. It&#39;s generally easier to qualify for welfare programs like food stamps and housing as well. </p>

 The state encourages breeding, and it encourages single parent breeding over two-parent breeding.  But it doesn&#39;t encourage single childlessness over marital childlessness.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The answer lies in the song &quot;Solidarity Forever&quot;.</p>

<p>When the union&#39;s inspiration through the workers&#39; blood shall run,
There can be no power greater anywhere beneath the sun;
<strong>Yet what force on earth is weaker than the feeble strength of one,</strong>
But the union makes us strong.</p>

<p>Chorus:
Solidarity forever,
Solidarity forever,
Solidarity forever,
For the union makes us strong.</p>

<p>Is there aught we hold in common with the greedy parasite,
Who would lash us into serfdom and would crush us with his might?
Is there anything left to us but to organize and fight?
For the union makes us strong.</p>

<p>Chorus</p>

<p>It is we who plowed the prairies; built the cities where they trade;
Dug the mines and built the workshops, endless miles of railroad laid;
Now we stand outcast and starving midst the wonders we have made;
But the union makes us strong.</p>

<p>Chorus</p>

<p>All the world that&#39;s owned by idle drones is ours and ours alone.
We have laid the wide foundations; built it skyward stone by stone.
It is ours, not to slave in, but to master and to own.
While the union makes us strong.</p>

<p>Chorus</p>

<p>They have taken untold millions that they never toiled to earn,
But without our brain and muscle not a single wheel can turn.
We can break their haughty power, gain our freedom when we learn
That the union makes us strong.</p>

<p>Chorus</p>

<p>In our hands is placed a power greater than their hoarded gold,
Greater than the might of armies, multiplied a thousand-fold.
We can bring to birth a new world from the ashes of the old
For the union makes us strong.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not a single parent so much as a single mother specifically. It all works to the state&#39;s design. It takes power away from autonomous nuclear family and essentially the government replaces daddy/father/husband in the relationship. It breeds dependence, locks down the democratic vote which will be more social programs, more welfare, more dependence, and less conscious voting for independent measures.</p>

<p>It&#39;s just a facet of attack to bring down the natural power the country holds within its people, culture and resources.</p>
