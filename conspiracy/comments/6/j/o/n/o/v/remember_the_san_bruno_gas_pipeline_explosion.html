       <p>
        Jacqueline Greig was "..a 17 year veteran with the Public Utilities Commission and specifically the lead of the natural gas section of analysts who devoted their careers to the statutory mission of the DRA (Division of Ratepayer Advocates) of minimizing costs to ratepayers consistent with good safety and consumer protection. Greig spent the summer analyzing the PG&amp;E's request for a $4.2 billion rate increase."
       </p>
       <p>
        "In what I'd call very effective analysis, the DRA (especially Greig, as lead) pointed to so many unsubstantiated cost allegations, including inexplicable doubling of estimates after previously adjusting for wage inflation, that the DRA countered with a $1 billion over three years counter-proposal. That's a difference of $3.2 billion -- and gives PG&amp;E approximately 3.2 billion reasons not to like Jacqueline Greig."

       </a>
       what are the chances that that huge pipeline would explode right next to her house during these negotiations?
      </p>
      <p>
       I got to thinking how are they going to "blow up" a pipeline it's not like they can press a button and make it go boom. And i don't think there were a crew of people with jack hammers trying to bust through the line before it exploded.

       is the were the blast crater is located. If you look at google maps in 2007 on the

        exact same spot
       </a>
       it looks like there could have been not only easy access directly to the pipeline, it looks like they actually knew that line had issues due to the street work done all around the area. There are a lot of patch works done all around that corner and that was 2 years before it blew up. This goes beyond a conspiracy and looks more premeditated.

       As someone who will be the first to tell you that public utility monopolies are mostly money-laundering operations of the deep state, and that there are plenty of valid reasons to oppose pipeline expansion, I really can't endorse the idea of niggling over something as stupid as "wage inflation" after what was done to the money supply in the 2008 financial crisis.
      </p>
      <p>
       Energy companies exist in the real economy.  Californians exist mostly in the hoax economy.  The amount of NIMBY nonsense and magical left-wing accounting bullshit that utility companies have to put up with is quite unbelievable.  And in California, it is truly off-the-charts.  Companies do their accounting in Federal Reserve Notes, not gold, because they have to.  So, guess what?  When the supply of Federal Reserve Notes doubles, the price doubles.  That's just basic economics.

       I have
       <strong>
        a lot
       </strong>
       more respect for Native Americans who protest pipelines going through their land, than these comfortable suburbanites trying to separate themselves from economic reality.  Because the Natives actually have some connection to the natural gas, to begin with.  Do these "utility commissions" ever express
       <em>
        any
       </em>
       concern at all for the fact that those fossil fuels are all stolen wholesale and the profits funneled to foreign bankers?  No, of course not.  They just want
       <em>
        all
       </em>
       the profits to go to a certain group -- the FED.  This is just a group of thieves arguing over dividing up the loot.

       They could have dug up the pipeline and placed a bomb next to it, but I do not think that they would have needed to do that. I know that in oil pipelines they have what they call "pigs" which run thru the pipeline to clean it out or check for corrosion or other problems. It would not be hard to attack a bomb to a pig and blow it up when the pig reached a certain place in the pipe.
