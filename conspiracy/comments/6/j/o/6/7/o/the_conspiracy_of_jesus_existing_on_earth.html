       Remember the Gospels and Acts were written AFTER Paul's letters.
      </p>
      <p>
       Encyclopedia Britannica: "The books are not arranged chronologically in the New Testament. The Epistles of Paul, for example, which address the immediate problems of local churches shortly after Christ's death, are considered to be the earliest texts."
      </p>
      <p>
       According to Richard Carrier, Paul's letters indicate that Cephas (Peter), James, Paul etc. only knew Jesus from VISIONS/DREAMS, based on the Old Testament scriptures.  Not what we would consider real life.
      </p>
      <p>
       1 Cor. 15.:
      </p>
      <p>
       "For I delivered to you as of first importance what I also received, that Christ died for our sins
       <strong>
        according to the Scriptures
       </strong>
       ,  and that He was buried, and that He was raised on the third day
       <strong>
        according to the Scriptures
       </strong>
       , and that He
       <strong>
        appeared
       </strong>
       to Cephas, then to the twelve. After that He
       <strong>
        appeared
       </strong>
       to more than five hundred brethren at one time, most of whom remain until now, but some have fallen asleep; then He
       <strong>
        appeared
       </strong>
       to James, then to all the apostles; and last of all, as to one untimely born, He
       <strong>
        appeared
       </strong>
       to me also."
      </p>
      <p>
       The Scriptures Paul is referring to here are:
      </p>
      <p>
       Septuagint version of Zechariah 3 and 6 gives the
       <strong>
        exact Greek name of Jesus
       </strong>
       , describing him as confronting Satan, being crowned king in heaven, ‘rising’ from his place below, and building up God’s house, given supreme authority over God’s domain and ending all sins in a single day.
      </p>
      <p>
       Daniel 9 describes a messiah dying before the end of the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       Isaiah 52-53 describes the cleansing of the world's sins by the death of a servant.
      </p>
      <p>
       Psalm 22-24, which Mark copies the language of, describes the death-resurrection cycle.
      </p>
      <p>
       Gerd Lüdemann says:
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        "Not once does Paul refer to Jesus as a teacher, to his words as teaching, or to [any] Christians as disciples."
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       and
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        "Moreover, when Paul himself summarizes the content of his missionary preaching in Corinth (1 Cor. 2.1-2; 15.3-5), there is no hint that a narration of Jesus’ earthly life or a report of his earthly teachings was an essential part of it. . . . In the letter to the Romans, which cannot presuppose the apostle’s missionary preaching and in which he attempts to summarize its main points, we find not a single direct citation of Jesus’ teaching."
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       Furthermore, Richard Carrier points out Paul viewed the death of Jesus (who had a human body manufactured by God) as occurring in outer space.

       Yeah I remember watching this presentation by a biblical scholar who basically said no independent person/historian actually met Jesus, everyone was at least ~60 years before he was born or 40 after he died.  In other words it's all 2nd/3rd/4th hand stuff being passed on orally.  We all know how reliable that is

       The mainstream view is that Acts is a completely fictional novel.
      </p>
      <p>
       See Richard Pervo, The Mystery of Acts (Santa Rosa, CA: Polebridge, 2008); and Richard Pervo, Acts: A Commentary (Minneapolis, MN: Fortress Press, 2009), for the most thorough accounting of this fact (see especially the latter, pp. 17-18), with substantial support in Thomas Brodie, The Birthing of the New Testament: The Intertextual Development of the New Testament Writings (Sheffield: Sheffield Phoenix, 2004), esp. pp. 377-445 (on Acts specifically); Dennis MacDonald, Does the New Testament Imitate Homer? Four Cases from the Acts of the Apostles (New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 2003); and John Dominic Crossan, The Power of Parable: How Fiction by Jesus Became Fiction about Jesus (New York: HarperOne, 2012), pp. 196-217. See also Clare Rothschild, Luke–Acts and the Rhetoric of History: An Investigation of Early Christian Historiography (Tübingen: Mohr Siebeck, 2004); Loveday Alexander, ‘Fact, Fiction and the Genre of Acts’, New Testament Studies 44 (1998), pp. 380-99; and P.E. Satterthwaite, ‘Acts against the Background of Classical Rhetoric’, in The Book of Acts in its Ancient Literary Setting (ed. Bruce Winter and Andrew Clarke; Grand Rapids, MI: William B. Eerdmans, 1993), pp. 337-80.
      </p>
      <p>
       Dennis MacDonald points out the shipwrecks of Odysseus and Paul share nautical images and vocabulary, the appearance of a goddess or angel assuring safety, the riding of planks, the arrival of the hero on an island among hospitable strangers, the mistaking of the hero as a god, and the sending of him on his way. Paul’s resurrection of the fallen Eutychus is based on the fallen Elpenor. The visions of Cornelius and Peter are constructed from a similar narrative about Agamemnon. Paul’s farewell at Miletus is constructed from Hector’s farewell to Andromache. The lottery of Matthias is constructed from the lottery of Ajax. Peter’s escape from prison is constructed from Priam’s escape from Achilles.
      </p>
      <p>
       Randel Helms has shown that other elements are borrowed from the Book of Ezekiel: both Peter and Ezekiel see the heavens open (Acts 10.11; Ezek. 1.1); both are commanded to eat something in their vision (Acts 10.13; Ezek. 2.9); both twice respond to God, ‘By no means, Lord! (using the exact same Greek phrase, mēdamōs Kurie: Acts 10.14 and 11.8; Ezek. 4.14 and 20.49); both are asked to eat unclean food, and both protest that they have never eaten anything unclean before (Acts 10.14; Ezek. 4.14).
      </p>
      <p>
       Acts contradicts Paul's own autobiography in this letters.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example, we know Paul ‘was unknown by face to the churches of Judea’ until many years after his conversion (as he explains in Gal. 1.22-23), and after his conversion he went away to Arabia before returning to Damascus, and he didn’t go to Jerusalem for at least three years (as he explains in Gal. 1.15-18).
      </p>
      <p>
       In contrast, Acts 7–9 has him known to and interacting with the Jerusalem church continuously from the beginning, even before his conversion, and instead of going to Arabia immediately after his conversion, in Acts he goes immediately to Damascus and then back to Jerusalem just a few weeks later, and never spends a moment in Arabia.

       No concept of outer space?  There was a concept of outer space going back as far as Ancient Egypt, but Paul lived shortly after the Greeks made great discoveries in Astronomy, he would have had a pretty good conception of an outer space where stars existed, even if he didn't know the specifics of what everything was or was made of.
      </p>
      <p>
       Still lots of miscontextualization, but he would have had a concept.

       I definitely think this is the case, as well. The Piso-Flavian Dynasty fabricated  it (via Josephus) to become Caesar.

       Well, I suppose if you believe in Christianity as it's written in the bible, but if you don't, like myself, it means something far more important.

       If Jesus truly was Caesarion and was forced (by his mother Cleopatra) to travel East for protection and knowledge, and was taught spirituality, then returned to teach it in the West, that would be huge for mankind. Caesarion was the rightful heir to the Roman Empire, who was now taught in the spiritual ways of the East.

       Think about that for a second and the ramifications of it.

       Richard Carrier's "On the Historicity of Jesus"  was blind peer-reviewed and published by an academic publisher.

       and Carrier has been unable to secure any University position, and every formal academic review of his book has been scathing. To have a discourse you have to have two dialogue partners. As of yet it is one person in a field of several thousand. That makes global warming deniers seem mainstream!

       That is a distortion of the facts. Over the past two decades the older methods that have been utilised in the third quest for the historical Jesus have been critiqued. There is nothing unusual in that. The first quest was critiqued by the second, the second by the third, and now by contemporary scholars. That is how scholarship works in every field.  But read Keith and Le Donne, and they present firm reasons, and have advanced current methods for believing in the historical Jesus. One of these authors even has a book on what we can know on the historical Jesus "Historical Jesus: What Can We Know and How Can We Know It" Eerdmans 2011.

       You quote Stanley Porter- are you aware Porter has co-authored a book with Stephen Bedard where he lambastes the idea that Jesus did not exist as pseudo-historical nonsense?

       Jesus was actually based off several different people: his brother, James, a couple "revolutionaries," and Gnostic-type Messianic preachers who lived roughly around the first century AD. Maybe more.

       The notion of a Jesus who walked on Earth only comes about with Luke-Acts.
      </p>
      <p>
       Mark and Matthew were INTENDED as symbolic fiction, and would have been recognized as symbolic fiction by any Greek speaking rabbi living BEFORE Luke-Acts was written:

       The sayings of Jesus in the Gospels were adopted from Paul's letters:
      </p>
      <p>
       Nikolaus Walter, ‘Paul and the Early Christian Jesus-Tradition’, in Paul and Jesus: Collected Essays (ed. A.J.M. Wedderburn; Sheffield: Sheffield Academic Press, 1989), pp. 51-80
      </p>
      <p>
       Lets look at some specific examples of Gospel fictions:
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        The Resurrection
       </strong>
       - Jesus was known as the ‘firstfruits’ of the resurrection that would occur to all believers (1 Cor. 15.20-23). The Torah commands that the Day of Firstfruits take place the day after the first Sabbath following the Passover (Lev. 23.5, 10-11). In other words, on a Sunday. Mark has Jesus rise on Sunday, the firstftuits of the resurrected, symbolically on the very Day of Firstfruits itself. So the choice of what day and year in which to have Jesus crucified is literary symbolism.
      </p>
      <p>
       How was the year decided?
      </p>
      <p>
       In order to have Jesus rise on the third day after his death, while also rising on the Day of Firstfruits, it had to be during that year.
      </p>
      <p>
       The death and resurrection of Jesus borrows ideas and specific language from Psalm 22-24.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        The Donkey(s)
       </strong>
       - Jesus riding on a donkey is from Zechariah 9.
      </p>
      <p>
       Mark has Jesus sit on a young donkey that he had his disciples fetch for him (Mark 11.1-10).
      </p>
      <p>
       Matthew changes the story so the disciples instead fetch TWO donkeys, not only the young donkey of Mark but also his mother. Jesus rides into Jerusalem on both donkeys at the same time (Matthew 21.1-9). Matthew wanted the story to better match the literal reading of Zechariah 9.9. Matthew even actually quotes part of Zech. 9.9.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        The Sermon on the Mount
       </strong>
       - The Sermon of the Mount relies extensively on the Greek text of Deuteronomy and Leviticus especially, and in key places on other texts. For example, the section on turning the other cheek and other aspects of legal pacifism (Mt. 5.38-42) has been redacted from the Greek text of Isa. 50.6-9.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        The clearing of the temple
       </strong>
       - When Jesus clears the temple he quotes Jer. 7.11 (in Mk 11.17). Jeremiah and Jesus both enter the temple (Jer. 7.1-2; Mk 11.15), make the same accusation against the corruption of the temple cult (Jeremiah quoting a revelation from the Lord, Jesus quoting Jeremiah), and predict the destruction of the temple (Jer. 7.12-14; Mk 14.57-58; 15.29).
      </p>
      <p>
       The cleansing of the temple as a fictional scene has its primary inspiration from an ancient faulty translation of Zech. 14.21 which changed 'Canaanites' to 'traders'.

       The cleansing of the temple as a fictional scene has its primary inspiration from an ancient faulty translation of Zech. 14.21 which changed 'Canaanites' to 'traders'.

       There are no historic findings pointing to his existence. Nobody during his time ever wrote about him. His entire childhood and teenage years are a mystery, even in the Bible.

       For being know as the son if God at birth, they sure as shit didn't keep tabs on him for the majority of his life.

       Lemme take a crack at this...

       Your source, "Cold Case Christianity", is not exactly unbiased...
      </p>
      <p>
       Its opening statements attempting to establish parallels between JFK's assassination and Jesus' existence are absolutely laughable as an incredibly disingenuous false equivalency. Modern day people may disagree as to who shot JFK, but the fact remains he did exist, was the POTUS, and was assassinated.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thallus (52AD): Right out the gates it says:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Thallus is perhaps the earliest secular writer to mention Jesus and
        <strong>
         <em>
          he is so ancient his writings don’t even exist anymore.
         </em>
        </strong>
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Wait, what? And not to mention 52 AD is some 16 to 22 years after Jesus' alleged death. It then goes on to profess:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        But Julius Africanus, writing around 221AD does quote Thallus who previously tried to explain away the darkness occurring at Jesus’ crucifixion:
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       So to be clear, now we're talking about a person almost 200 years after Jesus' supposed crucifixion allegedly quoting another person whose own writings "don't even exist anymore"? Well this should be good...
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        “On the whole world there pressed a most fearful darkness; and the rocks were rent by an earthquake, and many places in Judea and other districts were thrown down. This darkness Thallus, in the third book of his History, calls, as appears to me without reason, an eclipse of the sun.” (Julius Africanus, Chronography, 18:1)
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Seriously?? This doesn't even mention him! An earthquake and an eclipse? C'mon! Where's the big chief?? Better go ahead and apologist our way through this one and move on:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        If only more of Thallus’ record could be found, we might find more confirmation of Jesus’ crucifixion.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       But alas, all hope is not lost!
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        But there are some things we can conclude from this account: Jesus lived, He was crucified, and there was an earthquake and darkness at the point of His crucifixion.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Wow. Big leaps there. Somehow a non-proven, second-hand source over a 175-year span simply writing about an earthquake and eclipse = Jesus. Yikes.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd go on tackling the rest of your "sources" but each of them just gets farther and farther away from Jesus' present time. And that's my point that is clearly demonstrated in your "source": During the time he was supposedly alive, no one talked about Jesus. It wasn't until nearly two decades after his supposed crucifixion that anyone started writing things down about him. Did everyone just up and forget he was the SON OF GOD???
      </p>
      <p>
       Come back with irrefutable proof of documentation of his existence that was noted during his alleged time on Earth and you might have something. I won't be holding my breath...
      </p>
      <p>
       Remember: Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence. You'd think if the human-form of God paid us a visit that people at the time would be all over it. But nope -- not a peep, not a trace. Just stories spread far and wide decades later.

       Your question presupposes that we have literature from the time and place that could have mentioned Jesus. That is the actual point isn't it?
      </p>
      <p>
       Why do we have no literature about the fall of the Minoan civilisation? Why do we only have half a page of contemporary evidence about Alexander the Great? Might we believe that these events and individuals weren't famous or important during their time? Or we have no/hardly any extant literature left, and the above question betrays your lack of knowledge about the ancient world?
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, what writers or literature from Palestine (or say within 150 miles of it) do you think should have mentioned him?

       Only read part of that link so far - but Paul not denoting James or any other as biological brothers isn't at all evidence that he wasn't. in fact, in Esienman's book, he points to this very same fact, that Paul specifically, intentionally obfuscates the fact that a historical Jesus had brothers, and these brothers were known, and corroborated outside of Paul himself, some - like James - being significant historical figures in themselves. James existed, and the literature of his historicity seems pretty concrete, and even then, he was known as the first brother of Jesus Christ from the very beginning UNTIL the Pauline Corpus and the Gospel writings based on the letters, texts.

       You didn't understand the article.  In the Greek, it is apparent that Paul is using "brother of the Lord" to distinguish a generic Christian from Peter.

       ...I'm saying there is non-Pauline literature/ influenced literature that points to the fact that Paul, and his Gentile Christian slant/ Church, intentionally downplayed the fact that the historical Jesus had historically verifiable brothers - because these brothers were real people, and were always regarded as such from the very time period in contemporary accounts, because the things James and his camp - the Jerusalem Church, as opposed to the Gentile Church - were saying things contradictory to the doctrine that Paul was trying to establish. Some, for instance, were claiming that Jesus was not, in fact, divine, only a prophet a la Moses - this just would not do for Paul, who was in the process of writing [read: inventing] completely new theology out of thin air - the virgin birth, the concept of Christ Jesus, his divinity and sonship to God, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know exactly what Paul is saying. You're right, he ISN'T referring to James as the brother in the sense of biology but simply as another apostle - but NON Pauline sources point to the very fact that Paul INTENTIONALLY obscures the idea of James being the Brother to Jesus, along with "Judas" and "Simon the Zealot", other "brothers" listed in the apostle lists. In literature uninfluenced by Paul - so, non Gospel writings - it is very clear that James, and others, are not just brothers in faith, but biological brothers with a common mother, Mary, and "Joseph", actually written as Cleophas in many non-Gospel sources.
      </p>
      <p>
       It simply would not make sense doctrinally for the Divine Christ Jesus to have brothers, for he could have "only been born of a virgin" through the "Holy Spirit" [ another phrase and concept first even used by Paul ], and Mary could not be a virgin if she had historically-verifiable other, non-divine children, Jesus' brothers.

       The Shroud of Turin is real and is proof of Jesus existence... please don't tell me about Carbon dating that says it's from the 1500's, as that test was shown to be flawed. Cheers!
