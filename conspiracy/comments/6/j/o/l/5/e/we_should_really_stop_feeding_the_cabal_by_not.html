        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>We give them money when we pay sales tax, income tax, home tax, payroll tax, etc..  This is feeding a corrupt, criminal mafia who is entirely into pedophelia and worships Lucifer.  </p>

<p>In all moral reason, it is wrong to pay into a Satanic, pedophile cult that is trying to enslave and ruin the world. This comes in handy in case anyone is ever taken to court. We can simply tell the judge that we are aware that our government is using our own money to enslave and abuse us and so we don&#39;t want to pay into it. There may be a law that permits citizens from paying taxes if they are paying into a tyrannical state. It can be a form of peaceful revolution which is legal when there are enemies wishin. Basically, if anyone tries to threaten us with court, we threaten back with the hard truth. If we go to court, this truth of Illuminati enslavement will come out on public court. If anyone is taken to court, the rest of the community goes with him fully backing him up through the entire process for support. </p>

<p>Even without our taxes, the Illuminati has an almost endless supply of money that they can use to pay off their government employees. If their agencies start falling apart from lack of payment, the people will make their own upgrades, open source agencies to replace it.</p>

<p>By not paying taxes, we keep the money in house. The problem right now is that there isn&#39;t enough loose cash in the economy. The elite hogged it all so we are working with the scraps. By not paying taxes, we will increase the flow of money within the economy. If the government can&#39;t keep up with governing, we will replace them with our own open source systems. </p>

<p>If we decide to do this, we would have to decide on a date and just do it. Most of our money is being pumped into purely evil jobs anyway. It&#39;s  better to keep that money in house and if we need to fund our own open source agencies, we will setup a donation website that runs 24/7 so we fund it ourselves. </p>

<p>The beginning will be easy. We just set a date and we all go to the businesses we are regulars at and inform them that the people have decided to defund the evil cabal. </p>

<p>Also, since the government will continue to pay their employees for some time, the money paid is recycled back into the general pool leaving more loose cash for us at the end of the day. </p>

<p>This would be a very good start to turn the tables away from slavery and towards freedom. On a side note, we can declare all debts unfair as they are designed to leech money our of the economy without giving anything in return. </p>

<p>Edit:</p>

<p>It is pretty much our legal right to not pay taxes into a sinister system:</p>

<p>&quot;The U.S. Declaration of Independence states that &quot;when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government&quot; (emphasis added).&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As I said, we tell the judge why we won&#39;t pay taxes. It is because we refuse to fund the evil Illuminati system run by Rothschild to enslave us. Also, if the law messes with one of us, we will team up in a giant group and fight the case together. </p>

<p>We won&#39;t starve though. We will have more loose money in the mainstream economy. The government is always paying people to do their bidding so by not paying taxes, we are improving the economy. </p>

<p>At which point the judge brings out the federal budget, shows you where the money is being spent and asks you to identify the line that says &quot;evil satanist rape&quot;. Failing to do so, you will have your assets seized to pay your debt to state and probably be thrown in prison for up to 5 years.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Haha. You mean preserve the measly sheckles they have left. Better 1 sheckle than 0? No risk no reward. By not paying taxes, money increases since the gov constantly pays people but now they won&#39;t get any of those payments back since nobody is paying taxes. Once enough money fills into the economy, the whole economy will truly start booming. There is a minimum amount of money that needs to remain in the mainstream economy. If that quota is met, the entire economy booms. We are aiming to hit that quota. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It wouldn&#39;t help the economy. Think of it like this:</p>

<p>The government extracts money from the economy every second. Stop the bleeding and keep the money in house. Then watch the government pay employees which they do every day thereby adding money to the economy. Once the loose cash increases to maximum efficiency levels, the economy booms. We don&#39;t want too much money but we are way, way under the minimum level as of now. They jacked ten trillion from our economy and this is why the economy is at a standstill. That&#39;s how they cause recessions. Recessions aren&#39;t real. It&#39;s all manufactured. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think Charles Eisenstein misses the big point even though he states it,  he talks about interest as being a problem with which I agree with 100%</p>

<p>He talks about how money is the biggest limiting factor in people doing things they want.  I read somewhere that money is the biggest resistor to change and I agree with that as well</p>

<p>I disagree with his limiting beliefs though.  These 2 problems are easy to fix though without revolting.  Remove usury, remove the fed, increase GDP to 20+%, boom everyone has the standard of living of a millionaire or close to it without hyperinflation</p>

<p>I think big picture, he&#39;s pushing for a Post Scarcity Society which I am in support of but you need to give people time so they can see the world like he does.  You cant just collapse a system overnight and try to put another one into place.  They cant do it, or wont see what you and I see without the time to realize everything they have learned or believed was a lie?  How hard was that for you to accept?  Imagine 7 billion people doing that at the same time overnight?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>here&#39;s another approach that doesn&#39;t risk tax enmity, has the same effect and helps get off the tit.  i&#39;m not trying to be cheeky, btw.  you only get taxed on your consumption and your income, basically.  re: consumption - drop consumption levels (grow your own food, find low tech ways to do things that take energy, etc.) as low as you can go (it&#39;s a process).  re: income - drop income levels down correspondingly to match consumption needs.  seems counterintuitive, i know.  i&#39;m not trying to dissuade anyone from making money - but how you manage that is up to you.  all i&#39;m saying is that the tax suck happens when you are productive.  if you&#39;re not productive in taxable ways, but productive in other ways, then the gov can&#39;t tax you on what you&#39;re not doing.  how you use your time to be productive in non taxable ways is up to your discernment, of course.  but that time could be applied to increasing your resilience against having less cash.</p>

I like the idea, and have been practicing just that for 3 years. That is, I haven&#39;t worked a corporate job, instead doing some odd jobs here and there under the counter, and not paying rent by living with a buddy in his cabin, helping him grow food in exchange for lodging. I have switched to a local credit union and closed my bank account with a major bank, shredded all my credit cards. I also don&#39;t drive a car anymore, and get around by public transit or bicycle. Also, I used to be a regular Red Cross blood donor, but stopped doing that as a protest against the current health care system. As a personal side note: It&#39;s a lot of sacrifices, and my quality of life has diminished. I see it as my spiritual battle, going against the grain of society.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The other day I was in the yard and saw a little bird picking up a wad of dog fur, it then flew away to build its nest. It didn&#39;t go to the bank to take a 30 year mortgage (notice that mortgage literally means death pact in French). It didn&#39;t submit to a bullshit job, with stagnating wages, and increasing competition from globalization and automation. It doesn&#39;t have to take verbal abuse as a form of management. I bet it doesn&#39;t even get heartburn from anxiety over health insurance, nor does it need liquor at the end of the day to take the edge off. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t need to bend down and kiss the cabals ass for allowing me to be free in my own planet. Nobody can hold that over my head. I have a right to live a peaceful and productive life without hindrance from a tyrannical government. Anyone who thinks they should kiss Rothschilds ass for letting you live, albeit in shambles, is wrong. This world is ass backwards because the power we give our government is being used to torment us. How can we morally give them this power? We all know right from wrong. We don&#39;t need books worth of hundreds of thousands of laws that are mostly ignored by cabal who rules us. These pedophiles break every law that they enforce. Think about that.</p>
