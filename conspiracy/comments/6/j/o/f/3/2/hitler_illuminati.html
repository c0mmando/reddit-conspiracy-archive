       Me and you have already been through this. How about those accounts of human soap and lampshades, or the tickling death chambers, or the mobile gas chambers? Fairy-tales, that's all they are. There is no business like the Shoah business.

       History is written by the victors. Also, if it was true historical fact, they would not need laws against questioning it, now would they... Face it, there is no evidence for a final solution. None.

       Did you have any points? For all we know, the guards could've been lying to save their own asses. You know, just tell them what
       <em>
        they want to hear
       </em>
       , hopefully I'll get off easier, kind of thing. Some fucked up shit probably did go down, but it didn't come from the top as an official doctrine/order.

       Yes, so every single guard/ person there is openly lying to this day? Seems extraordinarily unlikely

       This the pointless thing that hitler never signed an order? Yes the holocaust wasn't planned out, but those at the top knew about it certainly. Himmler referenced it and visited the camps. Also  the death squads in the ussr had orders from the top, the rounding up was also from the top

       I'm sure there were death squads. I'm not denying that possible genocide didn't happen. It was a fucked time in history. But, it was not officially from the top.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, it wasn't just Jews being killed, it was Slavs, Christians, Gypsies, homosexuals, etc etc. Jews should not have a monopoly on WWII.

       You clearly don't follow the mainstream historical debate do you?

       This may be true, but if it is, it's because people are questioning it, so they have to keep re-framing it.

       This has been a debate a few decades now at least. No. This isn't just a case of not knowing the tiny intricacies it's a case of not looking into the debate whatsoever while attempting to criticise the mainstream.
      </p>
      <p>
       You claim to know about this issue but it's patently clear you do not, at the very least look at the Wikipedia on this. The different schools are on there! This is shocking ignorance

       Yeah, I've checked that out before. Rome vs. the Sabbatean-Frankists seem to be the final two conspiracy theories. Personally, I see more evidence for the Sabbatean-Frankists holding the power today which I can go into if you're interested.

       Why Sabbatean-Frankists rule not Rome:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        The money flows to Rothschild who are way more culty than Jesuity
       </li>
       <li>
        All current political events easily traceable to Zionist Israel, presumably informed by this cult. What does Rome want in Syria vs. what does Israel want in Syria
       </li>
       <li>
        Hard to imagine Zionists taking orders from Romans
       </li>
       <li>
        Freemasonry infiltrated by the cult, as evidenced by their entire mythos being centered around Solomon's temple, one of the cult's focuses
       </li>
       <li>
        1666 Weishaupt, Rothschild are united by Frank, who carries on the Sabbatean messianish Jewish cult. Perfect place to stop and analyze history without having to go back to BC, Egypt, etc.

       I will defend V_A (main Rome rules dude), the Jesuit theories and r/RomeRules:
      </p>
      <p>
       It's mostly one guy posting but others do too. The number of posters in a reddit sub doesn't mean shit. For example the Donald has a lot and it's rubbish. There are thousands or more here yet a lot of bots shills and losers on this sub. Doesn't make it better (?)
      </p>
      <p>
       There are a lot of trolls. Posts get deleted or chaned here too... I understand your point that he limits free speech is suspicious but no different to say te real world
      </p>
      <p>
       He actually explains and sources the Jesuit control of Zionism pretty well IMHO
      </p>
      <p>
       Lots of people are interested in aliens. I think aliens are fake and the amount Of interest doesn't add greater authority

      <p>
       I will look into the guys you talked about and the points you raise cheers
