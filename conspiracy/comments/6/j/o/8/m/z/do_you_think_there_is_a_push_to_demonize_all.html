       When I bring the importance of ethnicity a lot of people of the "SJW type" tell me it can only bring a racial calamity of epic proportions, do you think the mainstream narrative is to demonize any type of national love as something only crazy people support. Like all nationalism equals being a crazy Trump supporter and all that?
      </p>
      <p>
       It's scary how much we've gone down the rabbit hole. At first people bashed on conspiracy theorists for even mentioning the idea of a globalist conspiracy. Now the idea of not supporting a global government is seen as being a conspiracy nut or a right wing lunatic.

       Everybody (overwhelming majority) are now in two boxes: racist, nationalistic, xenophobic, anti scientific, hateful or the socialistic, anti white, pro Muslim, globist, trans pushing, entitled, welfare receiving box.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its really frustrating now because there is zero room now to talk about any ideas you automatically are one of the other. Its just same tried and true tactic of divide and conquer. I'm still young but I never remember it being this bad.

       The truth is not everyone fits into these categories nicely and neatly. Trying to divide people into one of the two, completely delegitimizes any valid arguments they may have. There's also a distortion in the way certain ideas are presented, for example many would consider republicans as racist whites because they may not support immigration from the third world, however I would argue that the democrats are the real racists for wanting to import people and give them benefits while ignoring the people that are already living here. The democrats are constantly exploiting racial minorities for their agendas. Don't we have a right to exist just as much as the people who want to come here too?

       I disagree, I don't think the overwhelming majority only see this as you have described.  I see that as an idea held by some significant number but possibly not even the majority of conservatives.

       Lots of assumptions here. It does not seem like you've taken the time to understand opposing perspectives. To the point where you're teetering on logical fallacy, false dichotomy mostly.

       The NWO's goal is not only to get rid of whites but to destroy all races. I've talked to it a lot with my friends and we think that while race is not neccesary for nationalism, people have a natural tendency to work together according to the things we share in common. By getting rid of whites they'll kill two birds in one shot, they will get rid of their greatests rivals and they will be able to do whatever they want with everyone else.
      </p>
      <p>
       I honestly fear for my country, right now the elites are using a lot of resources to get rid of the white race so I hope I can get to power before that happens.

       Depends on what your definition of what importance of ethnicity means and what your definition of nationalism means.

       Absolutely, and I don't even agree with a lot of nationalist ideology/ideologies (having pride in your nation or ethnicity is one thing, and can be a great thing, but the tendency for specific people or certain political forces to take that further into an ideology of inherent genetic superiority is real too...I'll let others speculate whether that is due to COINTELPRO-type agitators or something deeper in the ideology itself - or if I've just presented a false dichotomy)

       Dunno but the guy at alt-market.com has a good conjecture, which is that Trump is essentially the guy TPTB wanted, as he would be there to stir up nationalist sentiment. Then they'll pull the plug on the economy, making all conservatives look like tards. Then it will be easier to setup the alleged commie dictatorship. Which makes sense in a way.

       Do these people realize how utterly absurd the commie scare is? Sure, multibillionaires want to set up communism and have their fortunes seized. Come on! Then they wonder why the normies laugh and dismiss them. This kind of crazy talk pushes people to the "moderate" side.

       He is right about something. Back when I became conspiracy aware, the thing that got me hooked up on the idea of "big bad government" was indeed the similarities between the modern left and the communist manifesto, in a way the modern globalist conspiracy still shares a lot of similarities with it such as the "abolition" of nations and create a "nationless people". But it has evolved into something far more terrifiying. I said it a long time ago but one of the things that scared me the most was how they completely "crack" people into accepting the MSM narratives (basically how political correctness works) and I'm confident it can only get worse in the future. Just think about how they could make PC evolve into something worse.

       As for economics, there is no ideological system that will work. Be practical. Use the various forms where they work. Some things are better done by government. Some things are better done by business. Some types of businesses need regulation. Sometimes businesses need to be broken up.

       I'm glad there are people who uphold their roots. Although I'm still think about how to apply nationalism to my own home. Most people in latin america are hybrids of all races and there are some pure people as well, It's kind of hard when you have too much of a genetic diversity I'm thinking of using "civic nationalism" that will eventually evolve into ethnic nationalism of It's own.

       I don't have anything against the US people but I hate the US as a nation, It's a walking bad example...

       He is right about something. Back when I became conspiracy aware, the thing that got me hooked up on the idea of "big bad government" was indeed the similarities between the modern left and the communist manifesto, in a way the modern globalist conspiracy still shares a lot of similarities with it such as the "abolition" of nations and create a "nationless people". But it has evolved into something far more terrifiying. I said it a long time ago but one of the things that scared me the most was how they completely "crack" people into accepting the MSM narratives (basically how political correctness works) and I'm confident it can only get worse in the future. Just think about how they could make PC evolve into something worse.
