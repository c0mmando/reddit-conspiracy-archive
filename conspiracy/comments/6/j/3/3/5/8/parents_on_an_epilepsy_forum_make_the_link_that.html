<p>Some examples pasted below:-</p>

<p>&quot;my son was perfectly fine for 4 1/2 years we go to get vaccinated for school in 12/09 and he starts to have symptoms later that month and in Feb/2010 he is dx with seizures&quot;</p>

<p>....</p>

<p>&quot;my 2 year old daughter received a combo shot (PEDIARIX) of dtap, polio and hep b. 2 days later she has complex partial seizure, secondary generalization, status epilepticus. at the ER, no one paid any attention when i said she&#39;d just had a vaxx. 6 weeks later, another seizure, same type, but needed 4 medical interventions to stop it after over an hour. ambulance, hospitalizations, and now an epilepsy diagnosis&quot;</p>

<p>....</p>

<p>&quot;My daughter had her first seizure about 12 hours after her mmr shot at 12 months. When i contacted the administering GP we were told it was a normal reaction to the vaccination febrile seizure, and it will not happen again. from then on she started having myoclonic seizures where her eyes would roll for a split second. when i mentioned this to the gp they said, those will go away with time. instead of going away they have increased in length and frequency&quot;</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>&quot;My son had his 1st seizure IN THE DOCTOR&#39;S OFFICE 1-2 minutes after receiving two vaccinations. The seizures continued from that day forward. Three years later, the FDA and the CDC began a study to investigate the increase in reports of seizure following the Flu vaccine.&quot;</p>

<p>....</p>

<p>&quot; am a soldier in the U.S. Army and I did not start having seizures until I had vaccanations to go over seas&quot;</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>&quot;My son is now 6years old and has been having seizures since he had his first vaccine at 2mths of age, He had his first seizure about 36 hrs after his needle.&quot;</p>

<p>....</p>

<p>&quot;My name is Joe and my wife and I were also in the Army. She began having seizures days after deployment vaccines as well.&quot;</p>

<p>....</p>

<p>&quot;I just wanted you to know that I agree with you. My son Carter was a healthy baby until his 4 month old shots the night of his shots he started with his first of many seizures. He is now diagnosed with epilepsy and still having seisures. What is unbeleivable to me is the Doctors dont even acknowlege it was the vaccines.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As with most things when dealing with high population numbers that could be true.....but let me tell you about a mothers first hand experience.</p>

<p>Got MMR for her little girl,next day had her first seizure &amp; was rushed to doctors.Doctor asked the parent has anything changed in her life reasantly &amp; after telling him that she got the MMR the day before he said &quot;that&#39;s not it-anything else?&quot;.</p>

<p>The parent knew nothing about possible damages that could arise from vaccines &amp; that one answer sent her looking for truth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Vaccines should be mandatory, it&#39;s nothing to do with programming, it&#39;s about unbiased statistics.   </p>

<p>Take the human race as a whole, you dramatically improve the amount who will reach adulthood and be healthy by mass wide spread vaccines. There have been outbreaks of diseases almost wiped out due to unvaccinated people in recent years which is a step backwards in the overall evolution of mankind. </p>

<p>RE: Your point about more people are talking and complaining about it, that&#39;s true, but as Soshall points out quite correctly, there is no hard proof there is a direct correlation between the cause and reaction.
I can&#39;t imagine how difficult it would be to be one of the parents who write on those sites, but their anger is directed at the wrong people IMHO.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually my point of view has been formed by science, history and statistics. I&#39;m not saying it&#39;s 100% foolproof but it is by far the best option we have at this moment in time.</p>

<p>Your other suggestions are making your points weaker by taking hypothetical situations to the extreme, there are those who are allergic to them so can&#39;t have them even if they want to, those who put themselves at risk by not having them also put others at risk, to me that is much worse than ensuring everyone get&#39;s vaccinated.</p>

<p>If you&#39;ve got some actual science and 100% proof to bring to the table then I&#39;m more than open to take a look at it, but stories by strangers online isn&#39;t enough to reject hard factual science.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You believe your point of view is based on the science and statistics, but you have been misled as the neccessary rigorous and long term studies do not exist, vaccines get to skip the tests which other drugs have to go through, they don&#39;t even use real controls in the safety studies.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Statistics by who?...Science by scientists that are paid to push drugs &amp; never question the drugs as a cause!....&amp; you&#39;re lying about history,as anyone who has gone through archives will know the dangers &amp; lies that they used to push vaccines.</p>

<p>Immunization was a good idea that turned out to not work as intended &amp; causes severe genetic damage that can&#39;t be reversed,the only thing you can do is to stop the chain of damage &amp; hope your dna can heal itself.</p>

<p>As for that hypothetical situation,well it&#39;s not to far off if scum like you have your way now is it?....except it will be me &amp; my offspring on the ground.</p>

<p>&quot;Actually my point of view has been formed by science, history and statistics&quot;.......programmed speak.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t care if YOU want to engage in science experiments but you can keep it to yourself.</p>

<p>But if you want answers then spend some time <a href="http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/">here</a> &amp; get back to me in a few months when you look at some actual history.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The necessary statistics to show that vaccines give a net benefit do not exist, and the pharmaceuticals keep refusing to perform the studies, the former head of the NIH said it is because researchers are too scared of what they may find.  So the pharmaceuticals are not confident enough in their vaccines to allow rigorous long term studies, and they know more about their vaccines than anyone, hence we should not be confident in them either, vaccines are a shot in the dark.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>All you would need to do is look at average life expectancy over the past 30/40 years. How many deaths caused by certain diseases in which countries etc and while you may not accept the data, I do. </p>

<p>Are Vaccines the one and only cause of the improvements, no, clean water, access to better foods &amp; hygiene are also key. But Vaccines are the main reason in the number of cases with some diseases being minimal &amp; continually falling still. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure of the former head of the NIH or the things that was or wasn&#39;t said, but there are studies done, that have been done and continue to be done. Yes I too accept these studies aren&#39;t the final piece of undeniable evidence, but they do point toward vaccines being a benefit for the world as a whole.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Right, but there are a lot of things we choose to do less efficiently for a variety of reasons.</p>

<p>Take governance.  We choose some form of democracy, but benevolent dictatorship is by far the best form of governance that will provide the greatest good and happiness for the most people.  Why don&#39;t we have benevolent dictatorships instead of democracies?</p>

<p>Or eugenics.  We&#39;d save a lot of money and societal harm by removing certain genetic traits from the population.  A robot would make the call for eugenics in an instant, when you weigh the pros and cons there is no question whether you should have at least a minor eugenics program for the more egregious transmissible genetic defects.  You don&#39;t have to kill anyone, just sterilize them to make sure it doesn&#39;t get passed on.  But we don&#39;t.  Why not?</p>

<p>The problem is that human rights are not democratic in nature.  We are not robots, we are not computers.  In most cases, the rights of the individual instantly trump the rights of the collective.  That is not the most efficient way to run a society, but it is considerably safer.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>So this is purely conjecture, but I think it has to do with humans being a social animal, and about trusting each other.  I&#39;ll give my life for you, because I trust you to be there for me (and my family) if things get rough.  And I know I can trust you because I saw you care for someone who should have been left behind.</p>

<p>That&#39;s pure conjecture on my part, it&#39;s just how I think about it and how I explain it to others.  The cost of carrying the weak is outweighed by the benefit of trusting your group to carry you.</p>

<p>Of course, sometimes people do get left behind.  When and where that happens is a long and terrible discussion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s my pleasure, sadly mature discussion with different viewpoints seems to be dying out online.  </p>

<p>I do actually agree with what you&#39;ve said here, personally I am aware that over time I&#39;ve become more critical of people in general. </p>

<p>That I depend on myself for everything and nobody else to do it for me, so by my very nature I&#39;m more inclined to take emotion out of the question and see it as black and white.  </p>

<p>That if my life had been different I could feel and be part of a society where people are good to each other and take care of the weak just as they would the strong... then I&#39;d likely be torn by such a question such as the one&#39;s you mentioned earlier. I would think that I wouldn&#39;t be able to commit to letting anyone pay the price for the greater good.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>im not backing vaccines, i work in the industry and i know there is all sorts of stuff wrong with it. If you heard the stories I have, this stuff pales in comparison, seriously. However, I would be careful because this could be coincidence, I would like to see the stats on overall timing of vaccines vs. severe adverse events (epilepsy, autism, etc.) If we could get that info, it would be eye opening. My personal opinion is that all the issues come from Mercury being used as a perservative. Mercury is a know volatile chemical to the human body (especially the brain), but the manufacturers dont care because its written by the FDA to be ok and its cheap to acquire in bulk.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>yep. Im just saying that the source of the problem is the FDA standards that arent enforcing vaccines that have inert and known preservatives that arent dangerous to the individual. Instead they picked a known dangerous chemicals or unproven ones. Hopefully with this administration there will be focus on the efficacy of a drug, not necessarily the most profitable form. But honestly im not holding my breathe. The Big Pharma lobbying group has more money than just about any other.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We need to figure out the real reason the vaccines are being pushed , the real science around it.</p>

<p>I 100% believe vaccines do the job they are supposed to do ( except flu vaccine never trusted that one ) but its becoming more obvious that there is stuff in the vaccines that really dont need to be there and we need to find out the real reason its in there.</p>

<p>I do not think for a second the seizures are planned this is just an unfortunate side effect of whatever they are trying to do.</p>

<p>Is it possible that vaccines are used in sporadic areas for test subjects. I mean for example a scientist thinks that adding x amount of element Y and Z during the early stages of development might create more depression/anger maybe an addictive personality in some people and they test it out through the vaccines in small areas of the country.</p>

<p>This might explain why the number of children seemingly not effected by vaccines far outweigh those that are thus it can remain a stupid conspiracy. Maybe recently over the last few years they have stepped up the game and increased the testing.</p>

<p>Im just spit balling here the millions of reasons why our vaccines are being manipulated. ( I still do feel the actual science behind vaccines is just and they work in their purest form I just think they are being manipulated with other shit. )</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Of course, Measles is some spots and a runny nose, bit of a fever, just for a week.  When I was a child I went to a Measles party, it was all part of growing up.  As for Polio most people wouldn&#39;t know they have it, it is so mild, it is spread by poor sanitation, so not a problem in the first world.</p>

<p>However, Epilepsy is horrific, there is no contest here at all, I would far rather be getting a vaccine against Epilepsy that can cause Polio or a Measles.  The risks people take with vaccines are not logical.</p>

<p>Epilepsy is a life altering condition, but it can be managed. Scientists and doctors are coming up with new treatments every day.</p>

<p>Just like the treatment for not getting polio - a vaccine.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I find it life altering. I was misdiagnosed for a few years and it was hell. Now i am on a combo medication that comes with so many side effects that it makes living day to day a chore. I havent been able to drive for years now which, at 22, restricts quite a bit of freedom. I don&#39;t have it as bad as others, and for that i am grateful, because some kids have seizures constantly. 
I dont think its fair to speak for everyone. 
He also said that epileptics are treated like &quot;lepers&quot;, which i feel is extremely dramatic and contradicts his point. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What a strange thread, we have people trying to scare fearmonger us against Measles and Polio and then telling us that Epilepsy is not life altering, everything is upside down.</p>

<p>Each time you have an epileptic fit your brain gets damaged, you see people slowly going downhill, their minds not working anymore.  Parents not sleeping at night to be ready if their child has a fit.</p>

<p>The normal meds don&#39;t work, Marijuana the best med of all for Epilepsy being illegal in many parts of the world.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epilepsy">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epilepsy</a></p>

<p>&quot;Epilepsy cannot usually be cured, but medication can control seizures effectively in about 70% of cases.[7] Of those with generalized seizures, more than 80% can be well controlled with medications while this is true in only 50% of people with focal seizures.[5] One predictor of long-term outcome is the number of seizures that occur in the first six months.[24] Other factors increasing the risk of a poor outcome include little response to the initial treatment, generalized seizures, a family history of epilepsy, psychiatric problems, and waves on the EEG representing generalized epileptiform activity.[121] In the developing world, 75% of people are either untreated or not appropriately treated.[29] In Africa, 90% do not get treatment.[29] This is partly related to appropriate medications not being available or being too expensive.[29]
Mortality</p>

<p>People with epilepsy are at an increased risk of death.[122] This increase is between 1.6 and 4.1 fold greater than that of the general population[123] and is often related to: the underlying cause of the seizures, status epilepticus, suicide, trauma, and sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP).[122] Death from status epilepticus is primarily due to an underlying problem rather than missing doses of medications.[122] The risk of suicide is increased between two and six times in those with epilepsy.[124][125] The cause of this is unclear.[124] SUDEP appears to be partly related to the frequency of generalized tonic-clonic seizures[126] and accounts for about 15% of epilepsy related deaths.[121] It is unclear how to decrease its risk.[126] The greatest increase in mortality from epilepsy is among the elderly.[123] Those with epilepsy due to an unknown cause have little increased risk.[123] In the United Kingdom, it is estimated that 40–60% of deaths are possibly preventable.[24] In the developing world, many deaths are due to untreated epilepsy leading to falls or status epilepticus.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>epilepsy is not horrific and your saying that shows you have no idea what you are talking about. managing my epilepsy is as simple as 1 pill in the morning, 1 pill at night, and to be honest sometimes i miss the sort of halo effect in my thoughts before i went on lamotragine. </p>

<p>i&#39;m sure your only vision of epilepsy is some hollywood sterotype of someone on the ground shaking violently and foaming at the mouth. very few epileptics have generalized tonic colonic siezures. most don&#39;t even lose consciousness or convulse. i don&#39;t. epilepsy is an electrical storm in your brain, that storm is the siezure,  not what your body is doing. how it visibly manifests depends on where it occurs. if i was seizing right in front of you, neither of us would gave a clue.</p>

<p>2.5 million babies died annually in the united states from measles as recently as 1980. the kids your cavalier attitude harm the most are new borns. the next group are teens and young adults who neither had measles as a kid nor were vaccinated. measles for 7 yo might be runny nose and spots and a bit of fever for a week, but in a 20 yo it is almost always life threatening, as is chicken pox. so measles in you unvaccinated grade schooler may not seem so scary, but that kid is going to grow up, and then you will have to pray he or she never goes to disney world. or a sporting event. or a 4th of july fireworks display.</p>

<p>are you yourself vaccinated? i&#39;m guessing yes...</p>

<p>stop with the eplilepsy fear mongering and shaming. i don&#39;t need a &quot;vaccine,&quot; but you could seriously do with educating yourself about a condition before telling people they need to vaccinated for it. eplilepsy is not a disease, any more than a heart murmor or myopia are.</p>

<p>i just read that last sentence of yours again. i mean seriously go fuck yourself with your epilepsy blood libeling. it&#39;s people like you that cost people like me our jobs when we eplieptics are outed. </p>

<p>until christians and their vilification and damning to hell of anything they didn&#39;t like or understand, epileptics were revered. the greeks called epilepsy the sacred disease. in most shamanic cultures, eplieptics were those chosen to become shamans. we were seen as bridging the world of man and the world of the gods. bet nothing about you was ever considered sacred and divine.</p>

<p>At this point nobody is going to take you seriously, you&#39;re making up pure lies, you appear keen to downplay the seriousness of Epilepsy so as the risk won&#39;t put people off the vaccine and then to lie about Measles pretending it&#39;s a serious risk which which the immune system can&#39;t easily handle.  You are attempting to rewrite history and reality to misinform the uninformed reader and influence their decision on vaccination.</p>

<p>Between 1971-1975 the average <a href="http://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/pdf/10.2105/AJPH.70.11.1166">Measles deaths per year in the USA was 35, that&#39;s nowhere near your 2.5 million babies dying in the United States annually.</a>  And of those 35 most would have been malnourished, sick or immunocompromised in some way.  In the first world in 2017 Measles would be incredibly unlikely to kill you, unless you were already in a serious condition.</p>

<p>Really. You talk about rudeness when you put the rest of society and children at risk for reintroducing deadly diseases because you&#39;re too brain dead to trust science even though it has proved vaccines eliminated some of the most deadly diseases this world has seen almost entirely.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>By not vaccinating your child, your risk reintroducing antibiotic resistant diseases back into society by breaking her immunity which is our protection against those diseases. Stuff like polio was basically eradicated because of modern day vaccines, but it still exists, and the more it spreads, the more of chance it has to mutate against the antibiotics used to protect someone who has it. </p>

<p>We already have a gigantic problem with over usage of antibiotics and superbugs being created which are resistant to antibiotics causing them not to be as effective as they used to be. </p>

<p>So by extension, not vaccinating you or your kid putting society at risk as well as younger kids who are too young to get vaccinated making spread of sickness easier. Have you ever seen a baby with whooping cough because their parents didn&#39;t give the baby any of the available vaccinations at their age? Yeah. It&#39;s heartbreaking and infuriating. </p>

<p>Right. Because there&#39;s been so many scientific studies that show vaccinations directly cause autism or a higher risk of it. Not that bullshit study from 20 years ago where the researcherd came out and said it was their biggest regret as well as the scientific community disproving it through peer review. But sure, keep acting like vaccinations are going to suddenly change and cause a disease. </p>

<p>And Btw, what the fuck does having kids have to do with any of this. I don&#39;t need to have kids to know that not getting vaccinated is a danger to others and those with weaker immune systems like the elderly and people with immuno deficiencies. Your the one talking out of your ass. Everything I&#39;ve said is scientific fact and backed up by proof. </p>

<p>The burden is on anti vaxxers to come up with some reputable proof that shows the contrary. Guess why they can&#39;t? Because it&#39;s not fucking true </p>

Please, show me one modern vaccine that has had a thorough safety study and efficacy study done.  YOU CAN&#39;T.  You have the chief scientist on Guardasil coming out and saying they fudged their numbers, and that it doesn&#39;t work, and is unsafe.  Then you have people pushing to make it mandatory for 12 YEAR OLD GIRLS.  You have a CDC scientist whistleblowing and saying they are literally throwing negative findings in the garbage.</p>

<p>But please, go on using science as an excuse to trust known charlatans that have only profits in mind.  They don&#39;t give a FUCK about the health of your child.  </p>

<p>You REALLY want to argue that vaccines don&#39;t cause harm?  That they haven&#39;t been linked to autism?  They have.  It just got thrown in the garbage.

<p>You are virtue signaling.

<p>Right, because, you know, they don&#39;t have to go through years of trials and studies and peer reviews before they can even hit the FDA at which point it takes around 5-6 years of more tests and trials as well as regulatory red tape to ensure the vaccinations are safe for the public and finding any possible side effect they possibly can think of.</p>

<p>But no. According to you, pharmacuticals just throw vaccines onto the market.</p>

<p>What black and white thinking? What the fuck are you even talking about. I trust the verifiable proof and peer reviews that have been done over and over and over again on vaccinations and the conclusion is that there is no verifiable link between vaccinations and autism or any disease being caused by a vaccination. You just sit here spewing out your &quot;Facts&quot; with absolutely 0 backing, 0 place in reality or science, and you call me disgusting?</p>

<p>Uneducated idiots like you who start to question science without even attempting to look at the other side are dangerous to society. What studies are you using to back up your claims that vaccinations are dangerous? Where are your links? Who conducted these studies? Was the study peer reviewed by reputable groups or scientists/universities? </p>

<p>Keep claiming shit without linking anything. Once again the burden of proof is on you to prove they are dangerous yet you give nothing to back up your claims. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was going to break them down one by one but it seems copying and pasting things breaks when it&#39;s put into reddit.</p>

<p>So next best thing</p>

<p>The first study and it&#39;s conclusions states that high exposure to ethyl-mercury from thimerosal containing vaccines can contribute to a higher risk of neuralogical development impairment as well as specifically that of autism.</p>

<p>First off. Babies aren&#39;t given their first vaccinations until they are at the very least 6 months old. So that&#39;s out of the question. Secondly, ethyl-mercury, which comes from thimerosal vaccinations were stopped in vaccinations in 1999, coincidentally the same year this study was conducted, which people too dumb to actually look things up would think is definitive proof of autism being caused, except no vaccinations use ethyl-mercury anymore. So that&#39;s out. Thirdly, some of these studies are just flat out bunk or unrelated to vaccinations-autism.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>It may or may not surprise you to learn that an enormous portion of the papers in these lists had absolutely nothing to do with vaccines and autism. Of the 126 papers, there were 31 that were not about autism and 60 that were not about vaccines.</strong> I’m really curious about how a study that never even uses the words “autism” or “vaccine” can prove that vaccines cause autism. To be clear, I was generous in assigning papers to those categories.<strong>I did not score animal studies in that category (even though demonstrating autism in animals is essentially impossible) and I didn’t include papers on thimerosal (even though thimerosal is no longer in childhood vaccines)</strong>. So right off the bat, we have a pretty good reason to be skeptical of these lists.</p>

<p>Some of these papers were so off topic that I have absolutely no clue why they were included. For example, Guy et al. (2015) was on the relationship between pre-term birth and autism, and presented evidence that infants who are born prematurely have a higher risk of developing autism. I have absolutely no clue why Taylor thought that paper was evidence that vaccines cause autism (since it’s not about vaccines), and there were lots of papers like that in the lists (like Carvalho et al. 2011 which was on methods of treating mercury poisoning</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, see above, the studies after the first one I quoted talked about premature birth and the <strong>possibility</strong> of a risk to developing autism later in life. Not an assurance or a link, but a risk. Two very different things and unrelated to vaccines.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Other papers were on extremely tangentially related issues. <strong>For example, there were several studies on methyl-mercury (e.g., Rice. 1989; Charleston et al. 1994), but methyl-mercury has never been in vaccines. The mercury that used to be in vaccines was ethyl-mercury, which is a very different chemical with different properties. You can’t say, “methyl-mercury does X, therefore ethyl-mercury also does X.”</strong> That’s not how chemistry works (also most of those mercury studies weren’t about autism either). Similarly, there were a few papers showing that some component of vaccines were toxic in very high doses, but the dose makes the poison. The fact that chemical Y is dangerous at a very high level is irrelevant to whether or not it is dangerous at the low levels present in vaccines.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, another proven point, chia seeds are toxic to humans and can kill us in high enough dosages/servings, but it is a shit ton more than if you just ate some chia pudding every day. </p>

<p>Many of these studies just flat out don&#39;t even have anything tangentially related to vaccinations in them which causes me to not even want to bother looking past anything after the 40th study on my own. The rest you can just reference to my supporting sources below that I used as well as the fact that if these papers were indeed valid. You would have seen peer reviews come out by now confirming their links and claims, and yet, where are they? I couldn&#39;t find a single peer review that stated vaccinations cause autism. THAT is what matters, because a peer review that is succesful in producing the original experiment means that they are onto something and more reviews need to be conducted to see if they are about to change the scientific consensus on whatever it is they are studying. A great example of this would be the EM drive, whose very existence breaks newtons third law of physics, and yet, the drive produced verifiable thrust the first time, and then went on to pass a peer review. However, the process is not over, many more peer reviews as well as debates will be conducted in addition to the normal experiments Universities and NASA will be conducting on their own. Which ultimately will tell us if we have to take a look at our laws of physics as we understand it, or if the drive itself is doing something we don&#39;t quite understand and staying within the laws of physics.  Here&#39;s a good source on the discussion that goes on about peer reviews as well as the studies conducted and shows both sides of the aisle: <a href="http://www.snopes.com/2016/11/25/results-of-impossible-emdrive-propulsion-experiment-published-in-peer-reviewed-journal/">Link</a>. Criticizing a peer review is a good thing because then it allows further reviews to build off of what was previously done and see if they still get the same results as before but with different parameters and controls. </p>

<p>This is the process things like the vaccination link to autism has to go through before I&#39;m willing to even waste my breath on it anymore. They have gone through none of this because not a single study has been shown to pass multiple peer reviews. Proving that most of these studies can not be reproduced on a larger scale than the strictly controlled state that they use. And sometimes, even just using the same controls and procedures the original study used won&#39;t give the same result because a lot of times these studies are misrepresented in the first place based on the language used. But I&#39;m sure none of this proof and verifiable fact will change your mind whatsoever since if you had done your own research on your source, you would know this already. Yet I&#39;m the one drinking the kool-aid. Go have fun with your homeopathic medicines and let me know how that turns out since you can&#39;t trust science</p>

<p>Oh my god glyphosate isn&#39;t ROUNDUP, it&#39;s used in it as well as in GMO&#39;s</p>

<p>Yet, once again, </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Even disregarding the sloppy mathematics, the claim’s very basis (that glyphosate is the cause of a perceived increase in autism) is unsupported. No mention was made of how glyphosate was isolated and shown to be a cause (or even a factor) in some or any cases of autism in the article. No autism spikes near agricultural facilities were described, nor was any definitive causative link at all cited by the article (and presumably, Seneff) to back up the purported link between glyphosate and autism rates anywhere other than the imaginations of those making the claim. The single link of merit made within the article (to a USDA report) made absolutely no mention of autism at all but was misleadingly arranged to suggest a connection.</p>

<p>Childhood vaccines, as in it is no longer used with young children which was the main concern. </p>

<p>Not to mention even for the studies on thimerosal, none of them were large human trials that were capable of establishing causation. There were lots of small trials, animal trials, in vitro trials, association studies, etc., but large cohort studies were completely lacking. In contrast, remember that several of the papers in the pro-vaccine list specifically looked at thimerosal (as well as the whole vaccine) and failed to find any relationship. These pro-vaccine studies included a meta-analysis with 1.2 million children  (Taylor et al. 2014), a cohort study with 124,170 children (Verstraeten et al. 2003), and a case-controlled trial with over 1,000 children (Price et al. 2010; several of the other studies also used vaccines that contained thimerosal, but they did not explicitly test that component).</p>

You think you come off as the high and mighty, but to me you are just virtue signaling on a subject you refuse to question your trained beliefs on.  My dad is a famous pediatric surgeon, and even he has started questioning US vaccine scheduling and injuries.  Honestly, you make my blood boil, because you are SO convinced you are right.  You tout all the science being behind you, but ignore prominent journals saying they have been bought out, and are no longer trustworthy.  I am not here to argue with you about whether vaccines have helped humans.  I am here to argue to cronyism and corruption big pharma has brought to a once virtuous cause.  I am arguing the unnecessary injuries and deaths caused by vaccines which are not even necessary at the ages they are being administered.  You won&#39;t budge on this.  That much is clear.  You want very badly to be the shiny white knight here, showing everyone how smart and well educated you are.</p>

<p>I recommend you look up Docter Semmelweis&#39; story if you actually want to open the door to what I am trying to discuss.  If not, then go back to your other conversations where you can play the savior of the human race, and insult all those who disagree with your &quot;unquestionable knowledge and education&quot;.

    <div class="md"><p>Herd immunity from vaxx = bullshit.</p>

<p>There is one major elephant in the room that nobody considers in the discussion of herd immunity...</p>

<p>Adults.</p>

<p>Yep for the whole of current medical history only children have been receiving mass vaccinations (for many vaxxes, it stops at about age 5) at any one time less than 20% of the HUMAN population is receiving immunity from vaccinations (assuming they work 100%). Because no vaxx has ever provided life long immunity, many last less than five years, so by the time your an adult any immunity provided by vaxxes has worn off.
Herd immunity requires about 80 - 90% of a population immune to work. Please tell me what is providing herd immunity???
The only thing that has ever provided herd immunity in all the populations studied... natural immunity.</p>

<p>Tl:dr 95% vaccination rates in children, do nothing for herd immunity. 80% of all the humans (adults) are not vaxxed, therefore herd immuntiy = bullshit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>the first question i always ask when talking to vaccine-deniers is where the word vaccine comes from. i figure, if someone claims to be knowledgeable about vaccines and virology, they should at least know what the word means and where it comes from. it is very hard for people who do know what the word means and where it comes from to be anything but exhasberated at best with people who want to return us to the era when 2.6 million infants died annually from measles contracted while they were still in the hospital having just popped out with next to no immunity to anything. this era, most have been a long, long time ago...like...say, 1980.</p>

<p>vaccine comes from vaca, latin for cow. jenner&#39;s observation that milkmaids did not seem to catch smallpox, except mildy on their hands, that lead to his highly unethical experiment on a poor orphan boy, is what enabled the world to begin its counter offence against the most horrible disease that has ever plagued us. </p>

<p>until jenner proved that his theory about why milkmaids did not catch smallpox, which allowed them to be some of the only europeans to reach adulthood with out hiddeously scarred faces, the only way to preempt smallpox was by variolation--purposefully infecting yourself with the pus or scab of a current victim by a cut on your arm, and praying that you where in the the group that came down with a more mild case of smallpox, as opposed to dying (contracting smallpox via the skin is less dangerous than via the lung or the eye. through the eye was particularly leathal).</p>

<p>jenner&#39;s hunch was that the pox marks on the milkmaids hands weren&#39;t smallpox, but cowpox, which they caught and were made immune to the human version. voila, vaccination. and the reason that you have such nice skin.</p>

<p>let me back up a bit. smallpox, measles, the flu etc need populations of a minimum of 250,000 to remain endemic. periodically, the endemic flares up and becomes epidemic, then goes back to being endemic once the number of past and present survivors has reached about 80% of the population. as long the majority of people in the area are survivors, the resevoir of &quot;virgins&quot; is small enough to prevent large outbreaks. however, every generation there comes a point in time where the number of survivors dips below 80% and a new epedimic rages. the babies are the first to go. poof.</p>

<p>that is herd immunity. that&#39;s all it is, a hoover damn of immunes holding back an endemic river.</p>

<p>one other point, populations less than 250,000 are unable to sustain endemic resevoirs and so the number of immunes dies out in one generation. every time so asshole from a place where a disease is endemic shows up, the epidemic that results has the power to lay the community to waste (epidemics in the 250,000ers are less virulent, because they always have some immunes). </p>

<p>one other thing about virgin populations,  when they catch the disease it is significantly  more lethal due to epigentic &quot;immunity.&quot; smallpox in 18th europe, 30% mortality. smallpox in the mandan native american tribe, 98%.</p>

<p>the very people trying to force us back into the age of disease, at the same time that antibiotics are beginning to fail, will be the first ones blaming everyone for their childrens&#39; deaths. look how they screamed at disney world.</p>

<p>i only came to this thread initially to tell you that as an epileptic i find you dragging us into your bull shit is obscene. there are 1000 things that cause epilepsy, and a 1000 ways for it to manifest. most epileptics go undiagnosed or misdiagnosed for most of their lives. i was undiagnosed until 36. i have partial frontal lobe epilepsy that causes 1-2 minute long absence siezures. once i was diagnosed a whole lifetime of weird experiences were explained. my neurologist cannot know, no one can, where my epilepsy came from--it could have been from a fever i had when i was 4 that reached 106 (the doctors at the ER told my parents i would likely be &quot;mentally retarded&quot; when i recovered), it could be genetic, it could be a fluke.</p>

<p>epilepsy is an electrical storm in the brain. when children experience recurrent generalized tonic colonic siezures from a very young age, they were almost certainly born with it. i feel for the kids. severe childhood epilepsy has a high attritution rate. </p>

<p>epileptics are treated like leapers. the look in people&#39;s eyes when the learn you are an epileptic...</p>

<p>This poster is lying and posting pure misinformation, this line here should leave you all in no doubt, he/she is trying to claim that 2.6 million US infants died annually from Measles in the 1980&#39;s, yet the average around that time was <a href="http://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/pdf/10.2105/AJPH.70.11.1166">35 Measles deaths per year</a>.

<p>as we all know, vaccines are not 100% effective, and yet doctors never seem to bother to verify if yours worked or not</p>

<p>The vaccines worked because he did not contract the diseases. 
You know, literally the only thing vaccines are designed for?</p>

<p>And you expect all doctors, who give out any vaccine to give a call back and see if you haven&#39;t gotten the disease?</p>

<p>Do you have any critical thinking skills or do you just repeat whatever bullshit talking points you read without researching a word?</p>

<p>A scientifically and time proven thing is not &quot;faith based quackery&quot; you embarrassment to civilization. </p>

Samsung subs this out to a company that actually builds minisplits and they brand them as ordered. Making a counterfeit ac would be akin to a cuounterfit honda. It&#39;s not happening. The internals are the exact same across 99% of brands, there are no mysterious secrets about its oriigins.. it had to be made in the same place as Samsung units as access to toolING would put you well into starting your own hvac manufacturing company.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Epilepsy is the 4th most common neurological problem – only migraine, stroke, and Alzheimer’s disease occurs more frequently.  It occurs in around 1% of the population. 91% of children under 35 months are vaccinated in america, and 64% of adults are current. If vaccines did cause epilepsy, it wouldn&#39;t be every epileptic in the country is due to vaccines, so maybe 10 people contract &quot;theoretically&quot; epilepsy. We saved millions, every year. But regardless, the numbers aren&#39;t there, of you took every person that claimed they had an epileptic on a message board you would see there&#39;s more of them than actual epileptics. </p>
