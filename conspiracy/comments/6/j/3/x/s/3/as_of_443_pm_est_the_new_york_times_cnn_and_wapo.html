       Fact: Lynch asked Comey to call to the Clinton investigation as a matter to the public. This is the testimony of Comey and I believe it. Problem is no where did he make the claim that she was trying to end the investigation this the thing many people around here need to true because then its is a "SEE THE DEMS ARE TERRRIBLE TOO!" and they can use it to justify Trumps actions.

       No discussing how to address something to the public is not a problem and in no way changes or halts the investigation. Now her talk with Bill Clinton on the airport does seem suspicious but that doesnt seem to be the focus.

       Correct but the DOJ and FBI shouldnt have been talking about an ongoing investigation either but they had to so discussing how to address the topic is not crazy. (I do understand comey's issues with it as it seemed to mirror Clinton campaign talking points)

       The policy is to not confirm investigations in such circumstances.  The Hatch Act is intended to prevent officials influencing the outcome of elections in their official capacity, say by confirming an investigation despite the fact that this is contrary to policy and using the most sensational language possible to do so.
      </p>
      <p>
       You seem to think the duty is to ensure the public know there is an investigation but the usual policy and the Hatch Act meant the duty was to be extra careful to keep that information private.  Circumstances made that impractical but the notion that they didn't have a duty to minimize the harm and further actually had a duty to make sure their unusual departure from policy had maximum impact is bonkers and completely backwards.

       The Bill and Lynch tarmac meeting is enough to start an investigation on its own, but even worse than that is the recent revelation (apparently hinted by Comey) that Lynch promised to "keep the Clinton investigation from going too far." That is the kind of stuff that lands people in jail.

       For what purpose?   Comey's testimony indicates Lynch didn't take any steps to influence the investigation and she's left the job.  It's obviously a stupid and unprofessional thing to do and if she were still at her job it would be absolutely essential to address that but now she no longer has that job, what other than call her actions stupid and unprofessional is there to do about it?

       Because he directly referenced email correspondence in his possession that gave evidence of misconduct on the part of Lynch, and that same email correspondence is what is referenced and expanded upon in further detail in the Senate Judiciary Committee letter that I linked and that you didn't read.

       Er, you need to re-read that letter.  It doesn't say the FBI have an email in which Lynch makes such a promise.  It says there is a Russian document that cites a "supposed" email in which DWS is presented as having told someone that Lynch told this to some yet other person (in Clinton's campaign).
      </p>
      <p>
       You'll note that it is asserted that Comey testified this complicated things but he didn't say it was because he had any concerns about Lynch obstructing justice but rather that the information might leak causing a perception problem.  Why do you think that it is?  Do you think it's because Comey actually believes Lynch said that or is it likely that he believes something else, such as that the Russians produced that document and deliberately ensured it ended up on the FBI's desk despite the supposed email it refers to never having existed?

       So what you are saying is that it is basically okay for Lynch to have Comey publically state that Clinton is not under investigation ("It is a 'matter'") when she was under investigation, but it is
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       okay for Trump to request that Comey state he wasn't under investigation when he in fact wasn't?  And you have the gall to call this a partisan attack?  I mean...  Is this the same "logic" you use in your day to day life?

       Jesus Christ, watch it again.  You are hearing what you wish he said.  The Russia investigation was a consideration that made the decision harder, thus the "never a good time".  My god you people are so fucking brain washed by CNN, it is just mind numbingly stupid.

       The policy is to not call it anything at all - to not confirm it at all.  The Hatch Act obliges them to not negatively impact a candidate's presidential campaign in their official roles.  If they must refer to it at all, it's not suspicious that they use language that best serves the intent of the Hatch Act by minimizing damage to someone's presidential campaign.

       This is why the Dem's are losing, Obama was worried about all the rigged election talk so he did not react as he should have and slammed Russia for what they did. Being politically correct is no longer the path of the strong as we see daily from the actions of the current GOP. And yes I am a conservative but don't know what happened to my party, they have turned into literal savages with pay for play.

       Right. I don't actually have time to be my own journalist. I expect journalists to actually do their jobs. But situations like this remind that I cannot trust a few of these establishment. I actually just went to the LA Times too because they had pretty fair election coverage. It's not there either.

       We should support a fair and equal justice system, no matter who the offender. I doubt this investigation will go any further than declaring her actions inappropriate, though. The comparisons to Trump and his own investigation are too ripe for them to really play this up without getting hammered for it.

       Who gives a fuck...if you think scumfuck politicians or FBI are capable of an honest investigation you need to have your head examined.

       If the written articles are going to be any good, they'll take some time to write and to get actual sources quoted in them. Cable news has an advantage here because they can riff and just talk about the facts as soon as they come out, without having to produce a polished article

       But, it seems like you're not here to actually have a conversation and instead you just want to antagonize people in this sub using your multiple accounts.  Why not find a post you agree with and make some constructive comments instead of whatever it is you're trying to do?  Maybe you'll feel happier instead of angry and confused like you seem now.
      </p>
      <p>
       No matter what you decide to do, our little back and forth is done with.  It's not worth the time and you're not even trying to have an intelligent conversation, so I'm no longer going to waste my energy trying to convince you to do so.  I bid you good day.

       I'm not a Trump supporter, but I've seen a lot of attacks on Trump and very little evidence.  I mean, I don't think Trump is a good president by any metric (he's a self serving sociopathic businessman), but he's certainly no worse than the last four.   Why is the establishment losing there minds trying to take him down?

       On the other hand, the AG of the United States obstructing an investigation is a serious crime, especially if it was for political reasons.

       Youre actually as dumb as all the trumpettes.  Its classic misdirection, if you cant see how theyve been going back and forth with whos under investigation for what youre fucking blind.

        At a Senate hearing earlier this month, Mr. Comey told lawmakers that Ms. Lynch had attempted to change the way the FBI described its probe of Mrs. Clinton’s use of a private email server. The change appeared to dovetail with how Mrs. Clinton’s supporters were characterizing the probe.

       She told Comey to call it a matter, not an investigation.  Comey admitted that under oath.

       Is that not enough to warrant suspicion?

       No discussing how to address something to the public is not a problem and in no way changes or halts the investigation. Now her talk with Bill Clinton on the airport does seem suspicious but that doesnt seem to be the focus.

       The policy is to not call it anything at all - to not confirm it at all.  The Hatch Act obliges them to not negatively impact a candidate's presidential campaign in their official roles.  If they must refer to it at all, it's not suspicious that they use language that best serves the intent of the Hatch Act by minimizing damage to someone's presidential campaign.

       If you feel a post is in violation of the rules, as you so claimed, then why not report it?  Why mention an alleged rule violation in the first place if you were just going to wave it away by insulting the mods?
      </p>

       Why are you even posting in here?
