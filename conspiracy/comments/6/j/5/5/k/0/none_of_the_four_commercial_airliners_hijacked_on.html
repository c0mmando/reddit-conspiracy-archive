        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Ask any pilot what the first thing they do upon even suspecting a hijack, and the answer is always the same. &quot;Squawk 7500 to ATC&quot;. This is the most important thing a pilot or copilot can do, since it takes two seconds, and silently alerts ATC to the situation so that they can escalate to NORAD, take remote control and land safely if plane is outfitted with FTS or similar tech, etc. This also allows for appropriate covert means of communication between ATC and the aircraft so as not to alert the hijacker(s). </p>

<p>Squawking a hijack code isn&#39;t optional, and <em>all</em> commercial pilots and copilots are trained to follow procedure in the event of a hijack or suspected hijack. </p>

<p>This was standard operating procedure before, on, and after 9/11, and the fact that 8 cockpit occupants on 4 aircraft failed to perform this quick but major task to alert the ground is un-fucking-believable. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes it was. And it wasn&#39;t optional. I&#39;ve verified with both United and American Airlines. The 9/11 commission report touches on this briefly, calling it &quot;an anomaly&quot; since none of the 8 cockpit occupants followed protocol. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My ability to answer this question is somewhat limited, but if the means of remote control acquisition is the Flight Termination System module, then yes. Once FTS takeover is initiated, the transponder is effectively turned off. The airplane is 100% controlled by the ground at that point, it can&#39;t be overridden, and the transponder goes dark. The only way an aircraft taken over from the ground can be tracked is by radar. </p>

<p>one crew making the error is within the realm of possibility but four?  even without the influence of military training/indiviuals w/military training, its not plausible.

    <div class="md"><p>What coincidences? You truthers are nuts. It&#39;s not like</p>

<p>A.) A tower fell that was hit by nothing
B.) Both CNN and BBC called it collapsing 15 minutes before it did
C.) Bill Cooper called it months before
D.) WTC had insurance policy renewed two months prior
E.) Hijackers with 40 hours of flight simulation successfully hijacked and piloted four different airliners
F.) Immediately afterwards had the Patriot Act &quot;whipped up&quot; and passed 
G.) Same day NORAD ran a hijacking simulation 
H.) Day after Rumsfeld announced 2 trillion in unaccounted funds at the Pentagon
I.) Records kept regarding these missing funds were destroyed when Pentagon was hit by a &quot;plane&quot;
J.) All four black boxes were destroyed, but a hijackers wallet was found perfectly intact
K.) Only three steel.towers in history have ever collapsed from fires, all happening on 9/11
L.) Only 4 seconds of grainy video of the crash at the Pentagon are available, despite being in the most heavily surveillanced​ area in the entire country
M.) 16 years of war in the Middle East with 9/11 used as the direct launching pad</p>

<p>MAYBE if all the things above had happened, you&#39;d have a point.</p>

<p>It would require 6x the thrust first of all, and the air is so much thicker at 700ft, that the aircraft would be ripped apart if traveling at cruising speed, which is what the official narrative states. </p>

<p>Who though? It adds the Israelis who were set up filming before the attack (documented by FBI). it adds a team of CG artists which Israel could definately provide (they can train by piggy backing on a hollywood film about plane hijacking - this movie was found by investigating the background of disinfo agent Ace Baker). The media would just play the footage without asking questions.</p>

Now - with that said. Keeping the manhattan project secret was a matter of national security, at a time when the people working on it felt it was needed - it was both a major scientific breakthrough and a means to end a war as these people say it. It was easily justified for themselves why they needed to keep it secret. 9/11 in my opinion is not - there is nothing patriotic about keeping silent about 9/11, there is nothing to be proud of. People would have to be bought off or threatened.</p>

<p>I know it&#39;s tough to stomach, but these ultra-patriot government types would willingly keep their knowledge secret, even without being coerced. An example of this is the FBI&#39;s use of a real bomb via Emad Salem in 1993 and subsequent coverup. </p>

<p>Yes but it also takes a little time to know that you are being hijacked. Pilots wouldn&#39;t squawk 7500 without an actual reason. </p>

<p>It wouldn&#39;t be surprising to have the pilots trying to fight off the attackers and thus not having a chance to change codes before they died.</p>

<p>&quot;According to the purported tapes from the cockpit recorder of United 93, it took over 30 seconds for the intruders to break into the pilot’s cabin (Richard A. Serrano, “Heroism, Fatalism Aboard Flight 93,” Los Angeles Times, April 12, 2006). Flight 11’s failure to squawk is discussed here.&quot;</p>

<p>I said it was in the movie to illustrate how ridiculous it would be for them to open the cockpit door right after seeing &quot;beware&quot; in regards to hijackings. </p>

<blockquote>
<p> It was a text message coming by radio, from a flight dispatcher near Chicago. In green letters on a black background, it said, &quot;Beware, cockpit intrusion.&quot;</p>

<p>The message was sent by a dispatcher, sitting at the &quot;transcontinental&quot; desk at United&#39;s operations center near O&#39;Hare International Airport, who had been assigned to follow both 175 and 93, as well as 14 other airplanes that morning. </p>

<p>But it seems he decided to edit all of his comments to say he was banned so people would think he was banned for &quot;making sense&quot; or for relatively benign comments.</p>

<p>These are usually the same people who evade their ban and come back with a new username and proceed to post everywhere saying &quot;I was banned for being anti-trump!&quot; Or &quot;I was banned for hating Russia!&quot; or some other bullshit.</p>

<p>Tl;dr: rule breaking, while conveniently only editing their comment to say they were banned, but not why, specifically so people will post asking why they were banned. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>this is very interesting. my two takes are:</p>

<p>1 - code was transmitted but intercepted and ground control taken over by someone else (perhaps mobile units in...trucks?)</p>

<p>2 - there were no planes in the air but rather drones. or something else?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ahh, you&#39;ll appreciate the hell out of this. What if there was no &quot;ground control&quot;? There were planes in the air that day called E-4B. They are mobile command centers among the US military&#39;s most sensitive aircraft. Check this out:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>ok so im starting to piece this together.</p>

<p>1st tower was hit by a small drone. explosions used to magnify impact to create airliner &quot;impact&quot; scene.</p>

<p>2nd tower was simply explosions. i dont even think a drone was used.</p>

<p>these E-4Bs were used to create a false reading which could then be further &quot;scrambled&quot; or w/e to simulate path of these hijacked planes.</p>

<p>reason why stand down orders is because there were no planes to shoot down. </p>

<p>hijacker identities cretaed to make the false trail. </p>

<p>mossad trucks and other various crisis actors / operatives staged all over to do filming which is then immedietly altered to insert planes hitting towers.</p>

<p>same / other trucks were planned to take out bridges etc.</p>

<p>i think for me the only real remaining question is what happened to the hijacked planes. </p>

<p>i remember a great video about one of the callers saying something like &quot;its a hoax&quot;. perhaps the pilots were compromised. did emergency landings? the terrorists took all the phones away etc but they didnt crash them...they simply landed them and the passengers? probably murdered. dont know. </p>

<p>the planes? dismantled? sold? </p>

<p>question is where the tracking systems hacked? spoofed? planes had to be &quot;replaced&quot; in air so to speak so that these E-4Bs could create false flight paths to a point...and the other planes diverted...</p>

<p>am i missing anything?</p>

<p>type of demolition used imo is irrelevant. the only thing i can tell is that it was precision controlled. thats what sealed it for me about there being no massive planes (even if controlled somehow). all of this screams precision timing. </p>

<p>The phone call to which you&#39;re referring came from a flight attendant came Ceecee Lyle.

<p>At the end of the call, she certainly does whisper something. Best analysis has her saying &quot;It&#39;s a frame.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah but that&#39;s a lot different because people can identify a plane a lot easier than timed explosives. </p>

<p>We could only see pockets of air shooting out 40 stories below the impact on slow motion of videos.</p>

<p>I respect your opinion but I don&#39;t think the &quot;no plane&quot; argument will get us anywhere other than preventing more people from hopping on this search for truth. We can all propose our own theories though. </p>

<p>As for the noise, if I were going to pull off a 9/11 I would make sure to have plenty of things in the sky, presumably some other jets making noise. </p>

<p>There are not &quot;countless amounts,&quot; either. That&#39;s why I say this is a myth about 9/11. People can assume this but there are nowhere near millions, thousands, even hundreds of people you could point to as witnesses who saw a plane hit a building. Not that I&#39;m challenging you to waste your time doing this, but you could not find 20 people who were not media employees who said they saw the strike on south tower. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>First of all there&#39;s not a clear view from ground level, so many fewer people even could have seen it than most people think. In the immediate aftermath of what looks like a terror attack most people aren&#39;t going to stay in the same spot and look up at the attack site which happens to be a burning building. Now of course the building should not have and would not have fallen just because a plane hit it (if a plane really hit it) but people still would not just be looking up at the site. They would be getting out of danger. </p>

September Clues does a pretty good job of showing how that was all faked and recycled. Pretty sure they cover most of those in the first half hour. </p>

<p>Showing a physically impossible act like Iron Man flying or a Boeing melting into the trade center many times does not make it become physically possible. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>well what did he see? </p>

<p>and why need actors? could be intel services..mossad etc. playing their roles.</p>

<p>you dont have to believe me but ive already laid out what i think happened:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6j55k0/none_of_the_four_commercial_airliners_hijacked_on/djbqn6u/?context=3">https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6j55k0/none_of_the_four_commercial_airliners_hijacked_on/djbqn6u/?context=3</a></p>

<p>basically i think the planes were diverted and landed, E-4Bs were used as decoys on scanners (hence stand down orders - who would planes shoot down?) then drones used to simulate the sound, impact &amp; then  help with CGI later used in all the &quot;clips&quot;. </p>

<p>what proof do you want other than raw footage on the day? im just saying for me this solved my question of how a plane could be crashed specifically into a part of the building without setting off all the explosions they had planted there.</p>

<p>unless your saying the planes were hijacked and on their own brought down the towers? are you essentially pushing the official narrative?</p>

<p>i think the reason why this is so disputed is because its one thing for the government to be complicit in allowing 19 terrorists through...its another thing for them to use drones on their own people and false flag it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yup you said it great. They think we don&#39;t have people within our government that pledge zero allegiance to this country.</p>

<p>These close minded individuals think it is absurd to believe a few people in high level positions would be willing to let 3000 people die on 9/11. Yet we bombed the living dogshit out of Iraq which resulted in more than 1,000,000 civilian deaths on zero evidence that they knew was fake (WMD&#39;s)</p>

<p>So they can go to sleep at night with the death of a million civilians, many of whom were completely innocent, yet 3000 people would be against their moral values?</p>

<p>Absolutely, hilariously, ridiculously untrue.  The US does not have fighters within 15 minutes of every place in the US.  Not by a long shot.  The fighters just have to be ready to take off within 15 minutes of a report.  It takes much, much longer than 15 minutes to get them where they need to be.</p>

<p>According to Rumsfeld that plane was shot down. For some reason everyone just ignores this &quot;slip up&quot;. </p>

Cracked insulation on the wires in the aircraft allowed high voltage from the cabin lights to get into the low voltage fuel sensors for the center wing fuel tank.

Now it is without a doubt something not right with no 7500 sqauwk, as they would 100% had locked the cockpit once the warning came out, so <em>at least</em> one, in the most absurd circumstances, would have been able to squawk that code.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>9/11 is just the biggest shit show. Out of the extremely long list of things that are suspicious..at least a few of them have to be right.</p>

<p>Like seriously NORAD happpened to have war exercises that involved hijacked planes going on at the EXACT same fucking time. They were sending out orders for the fighter jets to take care of the real situation (9/11) and people were still confused about whether it was a drill. They finally said something like &quot;god damnit stop all exercise drills now!&quot; This was audio I heard directly from MSM TV.</p>

<p>Our fighter jets ended up flying over the Atlantic ocean? Wtf. The whole government did not have to be involves. Dozens could have pulled it off.</p>

<p>But he had a height of 20 metres to work with and Im not sure how big the target gets if you include the length of the building. He hit the building. I dont think he was specifically aiming for the area he hit.</p>

<p>Its just lucky. These things happen. I bet if it hit an area that held top secret information you would be telling us that it was an excuse to get rid of incriminating files on the JFK assassination.</p>

<p>There were explosives.  I don&#39;t believe it&#39;s physically possible for asymmetrical damage to a steel frame structure (especially one with a massive structural external frame on all sides) can cause it to fall perfectly on its own footprint in a perfect cascading collapse.  To get that you need to cut all the supports nearly simultaneously.  I admit I&#39;m not an engineer, but on the other hand I did study engineering for 6 years at a university.  Also, when the buildings were designed they actually calculated whether they could take an airliner hit, at it should have.</p>

<p>I believe he paid 3.2 billion and received 4.55 billion.  Not a bad payday.  It worked out nicely, since he was already planning to rebuild as of 2000.  This way, instead of paying for demo he got it done on the Saudi dime, taxpayers covered the cleanup, and he made a cool 1.3 billion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fair enough.  Still, awfully fortunate timing.  Òne would think he would take out a policy right after the attack, rather than just before the second one.</p>

<p>It fell almost perfectly.  Asymmetric damage doesn&#39;t lead to symmetric collapse, it leads to toppling.</p>

<p>767 is a few percent larger and heavier than a 707, but slower.  A 707 at top speed (which the buildings were designed to survive) would have a higher impact energy that a 767 at top speed.</p>

<p>Are you referring to something in particular?</p>

<p>Brother, I think the US government planned it.  Silverstein went along because sweet payday and free demo / cleanup.  That&#39;s billions of dollars in profit for nothing. </p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1993_World_Trade_Center_bombing">The World Trade Center was attacked in 1993</a> by Al&#39;Qaeda.  The Clinton Admin talked about the threat constantly.

<p>But, The issue of accuracy in these discussions is important.  There are many statement in this post, and throughout the truther crowd, that are very false.  I just couldn&#39;t resist pointing out to u/rodental, that he/she made a very poor argument.  He/She replied it was a fair criticism, but did not change his/her views.</p>

<p>I think it is important when your logic is challenged, you revisit your conclusions.  That is basic intellectual honesty, and is severely lacking in these discussions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, again, I&#39;m really not here to change any minds on the matter, but here is some info that should increase your skepticism. ( no, I&#39;m not gonna give you good sources, this is off the top of my head, so your mileage may vary).</p>

<p>Osama Bin Laden was a real person who really was planning and executing terrorist attacks against the US.  911 was his third (possibly 2nd) attack against the WTC. He was quite fascinated with the symbolism of attacking that building.  He never denied the attack, even though revealing the &quot;False Flag&quot; would be a bigger blow to the US than the attack itself.</p>

<p>Intel sent the Bush admin a warning that a Bin Laden attack was imminent.  The Bush admin did nothing about the warning, but there is no reason to believe that that info didn&#39;t get out in the business community.</p>

<p>Big money players always find a way to profit during a crisis - terrorism, war, disease, market crash, etc.</p>

<p>The buildings were built in an unusual way.  They were predicted to withstand a small plane impact, but not against the larger planes 30years later.  <strong>The Frontline Doc on this is very interesting.</strong>  </p>

<p>Bin Ladden was surprised by the collapse, and that wasn&#39;t his goal (it seemed that was his goal in the 93 attack)</p>

<p>Bin Laden watched many of his friends die in the ensuing years, and was eventually killed himself, while never giving any solid evidence that the conventional wisdom was untrue.</p>

<p>The 911 commission was a political exercise.  It&#39;s  conclusions may hold many mis-truths, but its purpose was to make people feel better.  Smart engineers on both sides may want to appear as though they have all the answers, but that was a chaotic day filled with paranoia and mis-info, so the truth may be impossible to be determined.</p>

<p>Any investigator who could reveal a dark nefarious US plot would be very rich and famous if he could prove it.  That is why so many try.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>At the very least flight 93 was confirmed to have received a warning. But this quote leads me to believe the pilots would have gotten the idea after the first two planes hit the towers.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The first sure sign of a hijacking was picked up by United Airlines Flight 175, which left Boston for Los Angeles at 8:14 a.m. Just after it took off, the air traffic controller had asked for help from other pilots in finding Flight 11, which was already missing.</p>

<p>&quot;We heard a suspicious transmission on our departure from BOS,&quot; the pilot reported at 8:41 a.m., just after takeoff. &quot;Sounds like someone keyed the mike and said everyone stay in your seats.&quot;</p>

<p>But who the hell trusts  NYT to tell the truth about the most lied about blatant conspiracy. Here is a youtube video with the ATC transmissions. Right around the 5:30 mark the ATC is telling other pilots that American Airlines let them know flight 11 was hijacked. So they knew 11 was hijacked before it hit the tower.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, I&#39;m saying it would put them on alert. Perhaps, closing the cockpit  door at least when you hear about a hijacking and then get a warning transmission to your plane that says &quot;Beware cockpit intrusion&quot;. Which would mean if they saw a suspicious man/men trying to enter cockpit with a box cutter.  That one pilot could at least struggle with the fella while the other punched in the code that takes 3 seconds, and then join in. </p>

<p>Out of eight pilots, with six of them being forewarned about a hijacking, none got to enter that 3 seconds worth of code that is at elbow level and out of sight unless sitting in the chair? I find that hard to believe with some of those pilots being ex-military and used to staying cool under pressure.</p>

<p>Asking for a source is not &quot;jumping down your throat / accusing you of lying&quot;.</p>

<p>That&#39;s what someone who is backed into a corner says. </p>

<p>to view where I&#39;ve provided proof of my claim. </p>

<p>Which you haven&#39;t. Which I&#39;m still expecting. And which you would link if you had it in the first place (instead of resorting to ad hominem attacks).</p>

<hr/>

<p>6-3-4. Special Emergency (Air Piracy)</p>

<p>a. A special emergency is a condition of air piracy, or other hostile act by a person(s) aboard an aircraft, which threatens the safety of the aircraft or its passengers.</p>

<p>b. The pilot of an aircraft reporting a special emergency condition should:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>If circumstances permit, apply distress or urgency radio-telephony procedures. Include the details of the special emergency.
REFERENCE- AIM, Distress and Urgency Communications, Paragraph 6-3-1.</p></li>
<li><p>If circumstances do not permit the use of prescribed distress or urgency procedures, transmit:</p></li>
</ol>

<p>(a) On the air/ground frequency in use at the time.</p>

<p>(b) As many as possible of the following elements spoken distinctly and in the following order:</p>

<p>(1) Name of the station addressed (time and circumstances permitting).</p>

<p>(2) The identification of the aircraft and present position.</p>

<p>(3) The nature of the special emergency condition and pilot intentions (circumstances permitting).</p>

<p>(4) If unable to provide this information, use code words and/or transponder as follows:</p>

<p>Spoken Words - TRANSPONDER SEVEN FIVE ZERO ZERO </p>

<p>Meaning - I am being hijacked/forced to a new destination </p>

<p>Transponder Setting</p>

<p>Mode 3/A, Code 7500 </p>

<p>NOTE- Code 7500 will never be assigned by ATC without prior notification from the pilot that the aircraft is being subjected to unlawful interference. The pilot should refuse the assignment of Code 7500 in any other situation and inform the controller accordingly. Code 7500 will trigger the special emergency indicator in all radar ATC facilities.</p>

<p>c. Air traffic controllers will acknowledge and confirm receipt of transponder Code 7500 by asking the pilot to verify it. If the aircraft is not being subjected to unlawful interference, the pilot should respond to the query by broadcasting in the clear that the aircraft is not being subjected to unlawful interference. Upon receipt of this information, the controller will request the pilot to verify the code selection depicted in the code selector windows in the transponder control panel and change the code to the appropriate setting. If the pilot replies in the affirmative or does not reply, the controller will not ask further questions but will flight follow, respond to pilot requests and notify appropriate authorities.</p>

<p>d. If it is possible to do so without jeopardizing the safety of the flight, the pilot of a hijacked passenger aircraft, after departing from the cleared routing over which the aircraft was operating, will attempt to do one or more of the following things, insofar as circumstances may permit:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Maintain a true airspeed of no more than 400 knots, and preferably an altitude of between 10,000 and 25,000 feet.</p></li>
<li><p>Fly a course toward the destination which the hijacker has announced.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>e. If these procedures result in either radio contact or air intercept, the pilot will attempt to comply with any instructions received which may direct the aircraft to an appropriate landing field or alter the aircraft’s flight path off its current course, away from protected airspace.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, again, I&#39;m really not here to change any minds on the matter, but here is some info that should increase your skepticism. ( no, I&#39;m not gonna give you good sources, this is off the top of my head, so your mileage may vary).</p>

<p>Osama Bin Laden was a real person who really was planning and executing terrorist attacks against the US.  911 was his third (possibly 2nd) attack against the WTC. He was quite fascinated with the symbolism of attacking that building.  He never denied the attack, even though revealing the &quot;False Flag&quot; would be a bigger blow to the US than the attack itself.</p>

<p>Intel sent the Bush admin a warning that a Bin Laden attack was imminent.  The Bush admin did nothing about the warning, but there is no reason to believe that that info didn&#39;t get out in the business community.</p>

<p>Big money players always find a way to profit during a crisis - terrorism, war, disease, market crash, etc.</p>

<p>The buildings were built in an unusual way.  They were predicted to withstand a small plane impact, but not against the larger planes 30years later.  <strong>The Frontline Doc on this is very interesting.</strong>  </p>

<p>Bin Ladden was surprised by the collapse, and that wasn&#39;t his goal (it seemed that was his goal in the 93 attack)</p>

<p>Bin Laden watched many of his friends die in the ensuing years, and was eventually killed himself, while never giving any solid evidence that the conventional wisdom was untrue.</p>

<p>The 911 commission was a political exercise.  It&#39;s  conclusions may hold many mis-truths, but its purpose was to make people feel better.  Smart engineers on both sides may want to appear as though they have all the answers, but that was a chaotic day filled with paranoia and mis-info, so the truth may be impossible to be determined.</p>

<p>Any investigator who could reveal a dark nefarious US plot would be very rich and famous if he could prove it.  That is why so many try.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>At the very least flight 93 was confirmed to have received a warning. But this quote leads me to believe the pilots would have gotten the idea after the first two planes hit the towers.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The first sure sign of a hijacking was picked up by United Airlines Flight 175, which left Boston for Los Angeles at 8:14 a.m. Just after it took off, the air traffic controller had asked for help from other pilots in finding Flight 11, which was already missing.</p>

<p>&quot;We heard a suspicious transmission on our departure from BOS,&quot; the pilot reported at 8:41 a.m., just after takeoff. &quot;Sounds like someone keyed the mike and said everyone stay in your seats.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://mobile.nytimes.com/2001/10/16/national/we-have-some-planes-hijacker-told-controller.html">https://mobile.nytimes.com/2001/10/16/national/we-have-some-planes-hijacker-told-controller.html</a></p>

<p>But who the hell trusts  NYT to tell the truth about the most lied about blatant conspiracy. Here is a youtube video with the ATC transmissions. Right around the 5:30 mark the ATC is telling other pilots that American Airlines let them know flight 11 was hijacked. So they knew 11 was hijacked before it hit the tower.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First of all there&#39;s not a clear view from ground level, so many fewer people even could have seen it than most people think. In the immediate aftermath of what looks like a terror attack most people aren&#39;t going to stay in the same spot and look up at the attack site which happens to be a burning building. Now of course the building should not have and would not have fallen just because a plane hit it (if a plane really hit it) but people still would not just be looking up at the site. They would be getting out of danger. </p>
