I wanted to know what questions do you definitely want me to ask both sides? Any &quot;smoking guns&quot; you want me to bring up and see if either side can respond to? We have a great opportunity here so I wanted to hear what we needed to make sure to not miss. Thanks everyone!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve also heard the theory that it discourages the idea of a creator, we&#39;re no longer in the center with everything rotating around us, now we&#39;re a speck in a huge, vast universe. </p>

<p>So it&#39;s easier to say we&#39;re not special, there&#39;s probably more life out there, don&#39;t worry we&#39;re no biggie. </p>

<p>I watch a lot of videos and like to entertain lots of ideas.  That&#39;s just some stuff I heard if anyone&#39;s curious and wants to look deeper into fringe stuff. </p>

<p>The ring/wall.</p>

<p>A mixture of buoyancy, density, and magnetism? I believe.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why don&#39;t we all go flying off the sides?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why would we? According to them, we are not moving in that direction. Good question for those about spinning ball earthers, though.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why do flight times only make sense if the earth is a sphere?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They really do not, tbh. Also, just fake it via auto pilot. Who&#39;s the wiser?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Who is pushing this ridiculous narrative?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Seems like a coordinated effort by legit questioners, trolls, and intelligence agencies trying to divide groups and dissuade people from looking into more legit theories like Hollow/Expanding Earth, imo.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Where is the ring / wall in relation to the continents?  If the earth is flat I should be able to see it with my telescope as long as I have an unobstructed view over the ocean.  If the flat earth is spinning, why aren&#39;t we being dragged sideways out to the wall by centripetal force?  And if it&#39;s not spinning please explain Foucalt&#39;s pendulum (an experiment I have, btw, tried myself.</p>

<p>A mixture of buoyancy, density, and magnetism, eh?  </p>

<p>Because it&#39;s easy to prove that we&#39;re in a rotating frame of motion.  If the earth is flat that rotation is necessarily around an axis perpendicular to the plane.  This would create a centripetal motion paralell to the plane and outwards from the axis of rotation, which would throw everything off the edges.</p>

<p>Oh, so by using autopilot you can turn a 12000km flight into a 500 km flight?  Tell me more!</p>

<p>So you agree that flat earth is obvious b.s. and that only an utter imbecile would entertain the notion for even a second that it could be true?</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Atmospheric conditions would impede this (ie. rain, dust, fog, etc etc).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If the flat earth is spinning, why aren&#39;t we being dragged sideways out to the wall by centripetal force? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>FE is not spinning.</p>

<p>And if it&#39;s not spinning please explain Foucalt&#39;s pendulum (an experiment I have, btw, tried myself).</p>

<p>Spherical Earth moves to slowly, relatively for this test to precisely demonstrate that it proves spherical Earth via the Heliocentric model.</p>

<p>Supposedly.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Because it&#39;s easy to prove that we&#39;re in a rotating frame of motion</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, how do you prove it?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If the earth is flat that rotation is necessarily around an axis perpendicular to the plane.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Once again, they do not think we are rotating. How are you not understanding this? I&#39;ve said it multiple times.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Oh, so by using autopilot you can turn a 12000km flight into a 500 km flight? Tell me more!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Other way around, but sure. Why not?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So you agree that flat earth is obvious b.s. and that only an utter imbecile would entertain the notion for even a second that it could be true?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Meh, there is something to it. Don&#39;t believe it, entertained it, learned their thoughts, and play Devil&#39;s advocate to challenge others in their beliefs. Honestly, dude, at least entertain the idea and see where they are coming from, before you take a hot shit on them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, I&#39;m going to vancouver for 2 weeks later this summer, I&#39;ll take my telescope.  It can resolve features on the moon pretty well, so I can hopefully see the wall that&#39;s apparently 6000 km high.  It&#39;s weird that when I flew to Australia it seemed like we were over the ocean the whole time, but from your map I can see that we actually flew over Russian and China.</p>

<p>What Foucalt&#39;s pendulum proves is that we are in a rotating frame of motion, which proves that the earth is a sphere, because a rotating flat earth would throw everything off.</p>

<p>Thing is, I do know, because I spent years studying physics.</p>

As you go high up, the horizon gets father away from you, making the individual shapes on the ball appear smaller in relation to the whole object.</p>
