<p>And making sure the wealthy pay their fair share.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Like deregulating banks, having their administrations be handpicked by citibank and being happy to preside over 4 decades where the gap between the rich and poor has been getting bigger and where median incomes have been stagnant.  Their failure to make the &#39;wealthy pay their fair share&#39; should disqualify them from being taken seriously. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>And making sure that all Americans have access to healthcare.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Like how the fight tooth and nail against universal health care? Like how Obama took the public option away? Instead passing an Act written by the insurance industry?   </p>

<blockquote>
<p>And leveling the playing field for women and the LGBT community.</p>

<p>Yeah, such great legislation like don&#39;t ask, don&#39;t tell.   </p>

<blockquote>
<p>You may disagree with their agenda but to suggest they don&#39;t have one is just wrong.</p>

<p>My claim to them having no agenda is about their current political situation.  But you ignored my second claim, and that is that they want to keep the neoliberal order running. </p>

<p>I ignored it because you&#39;re effectively right. There&#39;s no cohesive &quot;neoliberal order&quot; but every national-level politician spends far too much time protecting their own job rather than protecting their constituents.

<p>Well this really pushes as back into history, but again it was the corruption during the Democratic primaries where Wallace was prevented from winning the ticket. </p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1944_Democratic_National_Convention">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1944_Democratic_National_Convention</a></p>

<p>This in was the building of the anti-socialist climate we still have. So again it was the internal corruption of the party that was responsible. </p>

<p>Well I am sorry, but this is just not true.  </p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Consensus">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Consensus</a></p>

<p>They do spend their time protecting their constituents, its just that some constituents are more important, like the members of the Military Industrial Complex, and members of Wallstreet, and the Insurance industry.  It is those communities that count and get representation. </p>

<p>They don&#39;t have ideals.  They are opportunistic pragmatists who buy into Leibnizian notions of best of possible worlds was achieved.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting angle. Kind of a rope-a-dope strategy. Like when Ali fought Forman, he would lean back against the ropes and let Forman swing away at him. According to Norman Mailer, every time Forman landed a powerful blow, Ali would hug him and lean into his ear whispering,  &quot;come on, George.&quot; or,  &quot;is that the best you got,  George?&quot;</p>

<p>For the six weeks leading up to the fight,  Ali promised he would rely on his speed and agility to overcome Forman&#39; s power.  &quot;I&#39;m going to dance&quot;, he would  say, over and over, day after day. </p>

<p>But he didn&#39;t dance. He sat nice and still on the ropes and let Forman exhaust himself throwing punches. </p>

<p>Dems are swinging harder than Forman. Aren&#39;t they the least bit curious about Trump just sitting nice and still on the ropes?</p>
