       I don't really know too many good reads or documentaries about aliens or the like though, you can always look up Dr. Steven Greer (take him with a grain of salt).

       Collier is interesting, but I'd say only as an individual experiencer. He doesn't have the background to bring big-picture, meta-analysis to the subject.
      </p>
      <p>
       Greer did great with his Disclosure Project in 2001, but has basically sold-out and become less than reputable nowadayas.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are far better than these two, IMHO.
      </p>
      <p>
       Jacques Valles' Alien Contact trilogy is probably the best researched meta-analysis out there. He's the originator of the EDH and the man the scientist in Close Encounters is based on.
      </p>
      <p>
       Alternatively, the most unique perspectives I've seen are from the Wingmakers materials. The 'Neruda Interviews' cover a huge range of aspects, including ETs, conspiracy, and spirituality.

        UFOs for the 21st Century Mind - By Richard M. Dolan
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       A great little book that encapsulates the UFO phenomenon from where its been, where we are now, and where it might go from here.
      </p>
      <p>
       A really good summary and introduction to the subject taking in to account lots of the known evidence, documents and testimonies.

       I've read all of Dolan's books, but I'd still recommend Leslie Kean's UFOs for a primer. UFOs for the 21st Century Mind is definitely more asscessible, but I feel he asks too many hanging questions and implies or encourages speculation.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd highly recommend any of his lectures or interviews though. He's incredibly we'll spoken and a great speaker.

      <p>
       some others are "Day After Roswell", "Alien Agenda", "The Halt Perspective", and "Leap of Faith" by Astronaut Gordon Cooper.
      </p>
      <p>
       Gordon Cooper's book isn't entirely about aliens/UFOs but there are several chapters which he explicitly says in no uncertain terms on numerous occasions he has seen UFO's, both in outer space and here on Earth.  There is also a chapter in which he describes a close encounter one of his friends had with extraterrestrials.
      </p>
      <p>
       The book "Disclosure" by Steven Greer was absolutely amazing, because it is filled with testimony from military, police, pilots, and air traffic control people.  I would stay away from any of his other work though, most serious UFO researchers consider him a charlatan.  He seems to crank out books to make money, and a lot of his research seems to be a little hard to swallow.

       The thing I've noticed about Greer is that a lot of these people he trots out for their testimonials do not actually say anything specific now the words there's no real proof of aliens or advanced technology or anything that a normal person might suspect would be evidence of aliens. I've confronted him on this in person and on Twitter and his answer is always the same. At least he's consistent. He says that aliens exist and what more proof do I need than what he's put out there.

       Leslie Kean's book on  UFOs is the best primer and basis for the legitimacy of ufology. It can still be a bit dry, but such is the task of defining something such as UFOs.
      </p>
      <p>
       Jacques Valle's Alien Contact trilogy is the best meta-analysis from a historical and scientific perspective. He's an incredible researcher.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are
       <em>
        lots
       </em>
       of individual experiencers. Dan Sherman, Whitley Stieber, Travis Walton, and Karla Turner are all fascinating examples with significant bodies of work.
      </p>
      <p>
       Personally, I look for unique meta-analysis. The Wingmakers materials are the most distinct, in my opinion, and extremely non-traditional. The author intentionally interweaves his knowledge within a fictional context across multiple mediums. This makes it so much more captivating and sort-of mythic. It doesn't exist in a 'scientific' context, but still discusses science and physics in ways I haven't encountered before. It's really beautiful, and explores a lot conspiracies and spiritually in a whole new way. I'd recommend checking it out.
