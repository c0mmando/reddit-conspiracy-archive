<p>Published 1883. <a href="http://imgur.com/a/LiXkW">Error&#39;s Chains: How Forged and Broken.</a> A complete, graphic, and comparative history of the many strange beliefs, superstitious practices, domestic peculiarities, sacred writings, systems of philosophy, legends and traditions, customs and habits of mankind throughout the world, ancient and modern.</p>

<p>&quot;From authentic and trustworthy authorities&quot; </p>

<p>I&#39;m sharing a few pictures because I think some people on this sub might get a kick out of the book.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What follows has yet to be 100% proven but seems to appear likely.</p>

<ol>
<li>Hitler lost in Europe, &quot;suicided&quot; himself to escape.</li>
<li>Most likely went to argentina where he had friends</li>
<li>Made his way to antarctica where he had bases and cool crafts he made based on occult knowledge found in antarctica</li>
<li>FBI looked for him</li>
<li>Found him and launched Operation Highjump, 4.7k troops, 13 battleships, 33 warplanes for a science research</li>
<li>Byrd is apparently on the record on his way back saying the enemy had crafts that could fly pole to pole in an instant. They got fucked.</li>
<li>Between then and 52, no idea what they did</li>
<li>Washington DC 52, near the white house, a pack of UFOs are spotted and they are there for quite a while, got blamed on military or some shit</li>
</ol>

<p>Now we could speculate those UFOs were not alien but the guys coming from Antarctica. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>We turned the book in, so I don&#39;t have that book, but when school starts back up in Auguest, I am going to look over her new book. I am hoping it&#39;s online this year. If so, I can try to copy and paste anything I find on there. But one example was the use of the confederate flag. It was only talked about as the flag that the KKK used as their symbol of inequality. It did not explain where the flag came from and how it was made and designed when South Carolina succeeded from the Union. Also, my old history books used to go into detail about the Trail of Tears, in her book, it was just a small excerpt, as if it was an afterthought. Many native American&#39;s were captured and forced to walk the trail, many lost their lives. I will try to remember more, for now those were 2 that stood out for me. I am going to check her history book in August when we get it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In high school you mean? </p>

<p>During the cold war his fictional work <em>1984</em> was required. <em>Animal Farm</em> was also popular. I asked an educator once, who was approaching retirement age, if <em>1984</em> was still required reading. She replied &quot;no&#39; and explained because the Cold War was over. Interesting statement I thought. So there may have been a selected approach regarding Orwell. </p>

<p>Was this an attempt on your part to rebuke the idea that some of Orwell&#39;s writing, for whatever reason, may have been overlooked either by the academe or the mass media? I don&#39;t recall any academics going deep into Orwell&#39;s socialist politics. Particularly his observations in Spain.</p>

<p>Which of his works were required reading in your school? And during what era? And think of when you hear the term &quot;Orwellian&quot; used by the mass media. What ideas or images does it conjure up? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I will have to read that. I was very scared after reading it. As a senior in high school, I was old enough to know that society needed a change  but I was still young enough to believe that there were people out there that would not fall victim to power/greed. After reading it, I began to see that greed and power can change anyone. And that even the best laid plans can be messed up by people and their desires. I remember thinking, hey this is working for the animals. This is great, maybe society would benefit with a socialist economy but then Wham...I couldnt believe it! Honestly, I need to reread it, its been many years. I know what i am doing this weekend.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><em>Animal Farm</em> was a criticism of Stalinism. </p>

<p>Orwell remained a devout socialist, though. He was quite impressed by workers&#39; control as he witnesses in Spain:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The Anarchists were still in virtual control of Catalonia and the revolution was still in full swing. To anyone who had been there since the beginning it probably seemed even in December or January that the revolutionary period was ending; but when one came straight from England the aspect of Barcelona was something startling and overwhelming. It was the first time that I had ever been in a town where the working class was in the saddle...There was no unemployment, and the price of living was still extremely low; you saw very few conspicuously destitute people, and no beggars except the gypsies. Above all, there was a belief in the revolution and the future, a feeling of having suddenly emerged into an era of equality and freedom. Human beings were trying to behave as human beings and not as cogs in the capitalist machine. In the barbers&#39; shops were Anarchist notices (the barbers were mostly Anarchists) solemnly explaining that barbers were no longer slaves.&quot; George Orwell - Homage to Catalonia </p>
</blockquote>

<p>It was also the betrayal of the anarchists and other workers&#39; movements (including the POUM militia that Orwell belonged to) by the Spanish Republican forces and their Bolshevik allies that appalled Orwell.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ah, you’ve read it then? I should not have to tell you that the particular quote you used definitely needs context!</p>

<p>I take it all as more incidental to his being there. He went to fight the facists and it so happened that the factions opposed were radical. His observations are of something that was temporary, transitional, and different and largely observations more than ideals, though many would be common to preferences he expresses elsewhere. I’m fairly ignorant when it comes to political theory but I think I’m be right in saying that there are degrees of socialism when it comes to social democracy?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have read the book otherwise I wouldn&#39;t know of the many passages that were posted.</p>

<p>As for the quote, are you familiar with the context? Orwell wanted to return to the frontlines but wasn&#39;t interested in reenlisting into the POUM militia, and so preferred the anarchist as they did (as the quotes illustrate) seem to make a strong impression on him.  </p>

<p>There have been brief references in literature, and even in an article in The Economist a couple of years ago, to Orwell&#39;s socialist politics. But I do not recall any elaboration on those views. Not even definitive mention of his experiences in Spain. Just a brief remarks amounting to  &quot;...oh he was a socialist&quot; vein. </p>

<p>In fact, there seems to be some confusion out there about Orwell. In one forum someone asked if Orwell had been a fascist! I mean come on? </p>

<p>Lawl. You&#39;re going to place the caste system before agriculture even developed in the subcontinent?   </p>

<p>As for the caste system, it was no different from the relationship different classes had in all of the world. Varna translates very loosely into colour and, in case you need proof, look at the colour of skin of Krishna or Draupadi, both Kshatriya. The entire Aryan invasion theory is a pseudo scientific hogwash, with literally no proof of it not being a migration and if you look at the accounts of Megasthenes, you&#39;ll see him talk about how free Indian society was.     </p>

<p>The population structure of the subcontinent is just about the most well-documented phenomenon in history. We have literary sources, linguistic sources, archaeological sources and genetic sources . . . and they all create one unified picture of Population A coming into India from the North (and bringing European genetic haplogroups and languages with them), whereupon they encountered Population B: who all have Dravidian languages and DNA haplogroup M, linking them to Southeast Asia and Australia.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Look, every culture whitewashes it&#39;s history. Most everyone who has survived to modern times is a descendent of people who probably got pretty savage at times. No one want to remember their heroes as the monsters they sometimes were.
Part of this is how we expect history to be, a relentless march of progress, always forward, always better then before. But that&#39;s not how life works. People and nations fall for on their faces sometimes. But it&#39;s embarrassing to remember your mistakes. Especially if you are positing things like manifest destiny and American exceptionalism. Printing and teaching about our many mistakes erodes the confidence we have in our cultures. (This isn&#39;t limited to US history, out just happens to be one of the topics covered in the book mentioned below. As a Canadian I can attest we destroyed our Indians just as throughly as the US did. Just in a different way. Less bloody, but maybe more sadistic) 
If you are catching this in your daughters textbooks, what would your print have found in your texts that they would have disagreed with.<br/>
I would very highly recommend a book called &quot;Lies My Teacher Told Me&quot; by James W. Loewen. It highlights many, many straight up lies about American history.</p>

<p>But history isn&#39;t actually &quot;human history&quot; because it&#39;s not about the life and times of any ordinary human beings throughout the centuries but mainly about no more than a dozen or so ruthless aristocratic families going back all the way to Rome and Venice who eventually became the absolute monarchs of Europe right up until the 1900&#39;s. A similar familial situation also existed among most of the eastern potentates and rajas. </p>

<p>And as everyone should know the majority of elite US families and prominent politicians are either descended from or else connected to many of those aristocratic families by marriage.</p>

<p>At the end of the day it&#39;s all the ordinary people that have been conquered or subjugated by those ruling elites in one way or another who are the losers whose struggles and efforts to preserve themselves and what they valued most against the ambitions of those elites and elitists that has never been written about or studied.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When I lived in Paris &amp; frequented Shakespeare &amp; Company and got to know the (now late) owner, I did reach through some of the books in the rare book room that were older than 200 years, but they were all fiction, as I recall.</p>

<p>The oldest book I own is the second volume of the Freemasonry Dictionary, from the early 1910s. </p>

<p>why do you take that &#39;thousands of years of history&#39; on faith?</p>

<p>Because books tear apart over time and it&#39;s hard to pull a fast one with so many different publishers out there.</p>
