        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The Knights of Columbus are a Roman Catholic military order that operate internationally. Knights are military servants. The Knights of Columbus (KOC) take their name from the Genova born Christopher Columbus who was partially funded by the Doria banking family of Genova who are intermarried with the Colonna family of Rome and Savoy family. The names Colonna and Columbus both mean a column and Christopher Columbus was really a relative of the Colonna family. The District of Columbia takes its name from Columbus. The Knights of Columbus use the Roman fasces symbol for their logo and the Roman fasces symbol is also all over federal buildings and seals in the District of Columbia. The Knights of Columbus are structured like Freemasonic Orders with degrees and initiations. The KOC was developed as an alternative to Freemasonry since Roman Catholics are not supposed to be official members of Freemasonry although that is not always the case. The Knights of Columbus are headquartered in New Haven Connecticut which is also the headquarters for the Yale&#39;s Skull and Bones. Many police officers, lawyers, judges and politicians are members of the Knights of Columbus and are covertly serving the interests of the Vatican. The KOC endorsed Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito who is a suspected member of the KOC. The KOC claims in their endorsement of Samuel Alito that Roman Catholics are not fully accepted in America yet 5 of the 9 Supreme Court Justices are Roman Catholic today.</p>

<p>Jeb Bush is a fourth degree Knight of Columbus and his wife&#39;s name is Columba Bush. Dennis Savoie is the Canadian ambassador to the Holy See and has been Deputy Supreme Knight of the KOC and Supreme Treasurer of the KOC. Dennis Savoie like the House of Savoy which ruled Italy and put in the fascist dictator Benito Mussolini in power who established the Vatican as a nation through the Lateran Treaty of 1929. The fasces symbol used by the KOC is the origin for the word fascism which means a centralization of power. The Knights of Columbus are a secret society directly controlled by the Vatican. They are involved with persecuting those the Pope of Rome has declared as heretics and they carry out this persecution for money. I know of the persecution carried out by members of the KOC from my own personal experiences. The Italian Nobility are the owners of the Vatican, the Society of Jesus, the Knights of Columbus, the Sovereign Military Order of Malta, and the Italian Mafia. The Italian Nobility use their Knights of Columbus to infiltrate police departments and court systems in the United States which assist the Italian Mafia. The Colonna family are the primary owners of the KOC and they also own the Colombo crime family. Carl Albert Anderson is an attorney who worked under President Ronald Reagan&#39;s administration and is the current Supreme Knight of the Knights of Columbus.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Any place using the name Colum is Colonna territory like the District of Columbia, Columbia, Cologne Germany, British Columbia, Columbine, etc. The Colonna family are a real Illuminati bloodline. The Freemasons use columns or pillars in their symbols and the Colonna family are the columns. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great info, OP. If I can make a suggestion, you should add some graphics to your posts. Like this: <a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/565e1ec1e4b042ce34483ec4/t/565f73bde4b01b753bf6dda4/1449096132319/3rdDegreeLogo.gif?format=2500w">https://static1.squarespace.com/static/565e1ec1e4b042ce34483ec4/t/565f73bde4b01b753bf6dda4/1449096132319/3rdDegreeLogo.gif?format=2500w</a>. Shows the Fasces in the middle. It&#39;ll really drive you posts in home run territory, imo.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am sure there are members of the KOC and all of these groups and secret societies that are decent people however the groups are run by criminals and many members are also criminals. They should be considered organized crime syndicates and investigated properly.</p>
