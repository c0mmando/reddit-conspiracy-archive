        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>It seems as if every other school shooter has been thoroughly examined/studied after they committed suicide. All we have is a few pictures of him. In every single photo of him he looks creepy, there is not one normal looking photo of him, nothing candid. </p>

<p>I just started looking into conspiracy theories and why are there so many holes in the story? The whole thing with his brother was weird too. </p>

<p>Sandy hook if it happened was one of the worst school shootings of all time, yet there is so little known about the killer than individuals like Dylan Klebold and Eric Harris. You would think there would just be more information about him. </p>

<p>I do find it interesting that on sites I read about sandy hook such as Daily Mail and other sources that acknowledge it as being a real event, the comments are filled with people calling it a hoax. Even Chipper Jones one of my favorite baseball players tweeted about it being a hoax and then retracted his statement. </p>

<p>I just want to know why do we not have one piece of evidence that the shooting even occurred. It seems to be widely regarded as a hoax across the internet compared to other conspiracy theories. </p>

<p>Even my mom who doesn&#39;t really get into this stuff told me she just believes there&#39;s something off about the whole thing and the lack of information that was given to the public. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sandy hook was a major hoax... Adam lanza isn&#39;t real.. The photos are very photoshopped.. 
The school had been closed for years, and the entire town received compensation after the fake event.. I suspect that its a gov agency town.. Fbi, cia, witness protection.... That would explain the weirdness... Especially when you see some of the hand signals the parents were giving kids during the interviews.. Very CIA like.. 
Don&#39;t forget to look at the hat Adam lanza supposedly wore while killing himself... A hat that wasn&#39;t in production until 2013. (planted evidence) also the blood and hole are no way indicitive of a suicide.. </p>

<p>The hole damn story just gets creepier and creepier the more you look into it... The schools looked like a horror show beforehand , yet all these millionaires sent their kids there... </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Also supposedly some of the kids went down the road to a neighbor&#39;s house who did not call 911 or make any attempt to help them in any way.</p>

<p>You&#39;d think there would be more yearbook photos of Adam Lanza, or any photo that doesn&#39;t make him look like a photoshop composite, but there aren&#39;t any.  Also according to the official police report he was shooting at a rate of fire experts would have trouble maintaining.</p>

<p>There is so much information on the Columbine shooters and practically zero on Lanza.  Even if he was a spergy loner there would have at least been some people who knew him, but nobody has ever spoken up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My good friend&#39;s wife, who is american, knew one of the children that died. The kid had been living in the UK and went to the preschool she worked and moved back to the US then went to that school. She was so upset upon hearing the news that he had died. That makes the whole &#39;school didn&#39;t exisit&#39; thing hard to believe for me, unless it reaches out to an even bigger cover up.</p>

<p>It&#39;s weird because there are so many things that stand out as questionable that day and align with the most common conspiracies about the whole thing.</p>

<p>I would lean more to it being an actual functioning school with students and there were other sinister goings on.</p>

<p>The figures in black exiting/entering the school, the lack of/photoshopped images, the lack of info on Lanza, the amount of questionable  things makes me think something isn&#39;t right, but because of the above, I find it hard to believe the school didn&#39;t exist.</p>

I once read of a MKULTRA type conspiracy where rich and powerful people&#39;s children were manipulated and if the parents stepped out of line then the children would be made to crack. Doesn&#39;t mean they&#39;d go on shooting sprees but they&#39;d just lose their minds.

    <div class="md"><p>A lot of pilots were involved in the research here, and that was the conclusion of many of them. When Lanza happened, much of the attention went to that and the popularity of 370 dropped really suddenly. Since then, there has been a tremendous amount of strange activity in Antarctica.

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know what pictures you&#39;re talking about, but I will tell you a little bit about Sega Dreamcasts in case you didn&#39;t know: They are basically the &quot;cult classic&quot; console of console gaming. Games were easy to pirate and even create (lots of home-made titles were playable with the console). To this day it remains my favorite console of all time. It had a defect and was prone to breaking down. I was into fighting games and owned about 6 dreamcasts in my time, as it was the go-to console for such a thing and gamestop and other trade-in places sold dreamcasts and dreamcasts peripherals fairly cheap when the the new generation of consoles arrived.</p>

<p>They were basically the pez candies of console gamings and it wasn&#39;t unusual for people to own multiple dreamcasts in certain &quot;scenes.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not yo invalidate your opinion, I always thought they were one of the worst consoles of all time, similar to the Atari Jaguar or 3DO.  </p>

<p>As someone who played a lot of games, I would have only ended up with one of these if I received one as a gift and I probably wouldn&#39;t have used it much at all.</p>

<p>It is a very niche console, indeed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ryan Lanza, supposedly Adams brother, was taken into custody and has never been seen again. Im not sure why this isnt talked about more often.</p>

<p>I believe that they had to get rid of Ryan because his brother Adam didnt actually exist.  They had to get to him before he started to say that to the press.  Of course Ryans mother was also conveniently killed.</p>

<p>Why would they arrest Ryan when  his brother Adam was supposedly dead at the scene?</p>

<p>Ive been looking for information about what happened to Ryan for years.  There are profiles that are obviously fake after some scrutiny.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lanza_(family)">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lanza_(family)</a></p>

<p>Lanza (or Lancia) are an important family of the sicilian nobility descended from the Dukes of Bavaria. Over the centuries they have accumulated a lot of feuds.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manfred_I_Lancia">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manfred_I_Lancia</a></p>

<p>Manfred I (fl. 1160–1214), known as Manfredi Lancia,[a] was the second Margrave of Busca, famous for his financial difficulties[b] and his Occitan poetry. He was the first person to adopt the surname Lanza or Lancia, giving rise to the Lanza family.</p>
