        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Hunger Games seems to be about a dystopia that resembles the prison planet of the future that we sometimes speculate the elite have planned.</p>

<p>But, after watching this: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Se7i0gWDLp0">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Se7i0gWDLp0</a> my mind has changed.   The video is about the idea that an ancient human civilization was space-faring, had a war, and the losers were stuck on Earth and forced to be tributary slaves kept in poverty and low technology in perpetuity.</p>

<p>Maybe the Hunger Games describes the outcome of an ancient cosmic war?  Maybe the author knows something (New England elite family).  It exoterically has two levels.  First, as speculative fiction written on the level of understanding had by teens.  Second, as a &quot;red herring&quot; esoteric reading, as a description of the elites&#39; blueprint for a future prison planet.</p>

<p>But the esoteric meaning is that this is our reality today.  Earth is district 12.  It could be that the UFO thing is extradimensional, and that suffering itself is a spiritual energy tribute to our ancient cousins.  Or, maybe it&#39;s more mundane.</p>

<p>According to Joseph Pharrell who made the youtube video, sacrifice is a political act.  By giving up your wealth or firstborn or whatever, you&#39;re engaging in an act of submission.  You&#39;re willfully submitting because the oblivion that awaits otherwise is even worse.  So maybe these &quot;archons&quot; or basically enemy spies of other worlds have instituted political and religious systems on Earth meant to keep us spiritually trapped and exhausted.</p>

<p>Maybe the technology we&#39;ve seen in the past 200 years is a product of shifts in cosmic politics.  Despite the Verseilles treaty, Hitler rearmed as politics changed.  Maybe something like that is going on.</p>

<p>What this implies is that there are other humans living on nearby worlds, that that&#39;s being covered up, and that we are on the edge of a vast enlightenment.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>FBI anon when asked if aliens existed he said:
&quot;If you want to call them aliens...&quot;</p>

<p>there is the theory though that aryans originate from space, i believe they come from inside the earth though.
There are cultures from all around the world talking of blonde/red haired, blue eyed people with white skin that came over the sea and brought civilization, including the sumerians. Where did those come from when the sumerians where the first, and why are the people discribed always the same if they were just made up?
The sumerians believed the blue eyed white people where gods, the annunaki. The Aztecs as well, and describe them from coming over the sea with a ship that moved on its own. The chinese talk about blue eyed and blonde haired people who created the first civilization and ruled in the early time. A lot of egyptians mummies are shown to have had blonde hair etc.
The nordic gods, thor, odin, all blond and blue eyed, and (((coincidently))) asgard is on a map that supposedly shows the inner part of the earth
Hitlers Ahnenerbe tried to find out about the origins of the white people, and maybe he did find out something (((they))) absolutely fear which is the reason (((they))) try to destroy whites so furiously, more than any other ethnicities.
Later on Hitler went to antarctica, created New Swabia and again a lot of cultures speak about a realm beneath the earth, like shangri la for example, and civilization is said to exist there as well.
Did Hitler find out that the whites, or at least those people who spreaded knowledge (which may have nothing to do with whites today) came from the inner earth, the biblical paradise, and from there spread their knowledge with others. Is this why (((they))) w
Another interesting thing is that &quot;Paradise&quot; in the bible originally came from the word meaning &quot;walled enclosure&quot; which would be pretty much fitting to the inner earth.
the hopi indians, also have the swastika. and their legends involve humanity coming from out of a hole on earth, and during the end of the 4th world/cycle (i think it was the 4th) when the flood hit (whch probably was the same the bible mentioned as well as many others cultures) other people came out of the earth, the ant-friends or ant people, brought them underground and ensured their survival until the earth above is habitable again. further more. further more the word &quot;anu&quot; means for the hopi indians &quot;ant&quot; and naki &quot;friend&quot; while the sumerian gods were called anunaki, so probably those were the same.
however from what i found the description of the ant people doesnt really fit, they seem humanoid but not human. but maybe there are multiple races living in hollow earth living peacefully there together. sumerians and hopi also used the swastika</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Whether I am or not is irrelevant. The Nordics work FOR the Reptilians; that&#39;s why many are negative. They are not to be confused from certain factions from the Inner Earth, such as the Anshar who also look Nordic. </p>

<p>As for the Inner Earth folk they have helped humans in the past, but they generally went back underground; they did not intermingle with surface humans for too long. </p>

<p>There were many ET influences and also Inner Earth influences. You can&#39;t lump them all with the Nordics in order to prove that the white race is somehow better. And by the way, whites as a group have only been attacked recently. It was the blacks for thousands of years who have been suppressed, by Greeks, Arabs and Europeans.</p>

<p>Note I am not black. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You should check out Graham Hancock. He theorizes that an ancient celestial body wiped out North America. The people of the world would have felt it, but the North American people would have been decimated. Perhaps the few survivors eventually crawled out of their holes and began disseminating knowledge. At any rate, you should check out Hancock if you&#39;re interested in ancient civilizations. Dude has blown my mind.</p>
