       So, I did somewhat of a responsive experiment yesterday at
       <a href="/r/askreddit">
        /r/askreddit
       </a>
       . There was a post that took off titled
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/6jbyu1/serious_people_who_have_lived_under_sharia_law/">
        [Serious] People who have lived under Sharia Law, what was it really?
       </a>
       . To no one's surprise, the post went front page with thousands of upvotes and comments. I decided to make a post titled
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/6jgll5/seriouspeople_who_have_lived_under_zionism_what/">
        People who have lived under Zionism, what was it really like?
       </a>
       . Now, you'd figure, since we feel the effects of Zionism globally everyday much greater than Sharia Law, upvotes and comments would flood in. I waited 45 minutes. What did I get? I got downvoted and garnered one comment and a reply to my comment. That was it. The state of Reddit is a reflection of the planet and WILL get worse before it gets better.

       Most people have no idea what zionism is. They have been brainwashed into believing that it's just agreeing that israel needs to exiist because of the holocaust and all arabs and muslims want to drive jews into the sea. Naturally, they think that opposing zionim means you're a muslim nazi who wants to kill all jews.

       Well, you have to admit that the community of people opposing Zionism does tend to have some overlap with actual antisemites—you know, the kind that deny the Holocaust, think the Protocols of the Elders are real, believe Jews are the source of all greed and corruption, etc. To an outsider, it would be easy to conflate the two camps.

       Considering how vague the Protocols were, this isn't really surprising. "The media will be used as a propaganda tool, morals will change, society will become less religious, there will be global wars, and Jews will continue to be common in the financial world." Wow, I'm shocked.
      </p>

       Is it so hard to believe that greed and corruption might be universal human problems, instead of blaming one ethnic group? Yeah, we gentiles are just so snowy-white pure that we really needed Jews to corrupt us. Sure lol

       Well, my own greed and corruption is not about to start world war 3. If your greed and corruption isn't doing that either, you're welcome to it. But when one group's ideology is reshaping the world and plunging us into war;  well, that is kind of a problem that effects all of us.

       Of course greed and corruption are universal problems. But Zionism is terrible in every aspect. In the most innocent aspect it states that one ethnic group is entitled to one terroritory of land that belongs to them and everyone else is below them.

       They've been considered forgery since the 1920s, after an investigation by the London Times. The Times didn't just label them a forgery—they provided evidence for this claim. Now the burden is on you to explain why they were wrong and why I should consider the Protocols a genuine historical document.

       Have you actually examined the so called evidence they used to claim it was a forgery? The clim is based on a loose paraphrase from an earlier work by a guy named Maurice Joly, and Joly himself had plagiarized it from someone else. The existence of that paraphrase only implies that the author likely read Joly's work, or the work Joly plagiarised. If genuine, the Protocols were never intended for wide publiation. To claim that the paraphrase is proof that the document is a forgery is laughable.

       However you look at it, the existence of the paraphrasing of a satirical text puts a pretty big dent in the idea that the Protocols are an actual account of a meeting of Jewish elders. Not to mention the strong resemblances to earlier canards, as well as Goedsche's novel. If you want to split hairs about this, that's fine—I'm not trying to stop you. I just think it would be important for you to remember that the world might not be as black and white as you believe it to be.

       My point is not to say that there aren't probably some Jews aiming for world domination, but rather that it isn't
       <em>
        only
       </em>
       Jews aiming for world domination. Off the top of my head, the Jesuits and the Rockefeller family come to mind.

       People who publicly and vocally oppose zionist actions and policies are often viciously attacked and browbeaten by pro zionists, most of who are jewish. Anti- zionists may not start off as antisemites, but after an extended  period of attacks and accusations, the feeling grows.

       The funny thing is the question "People who have lived under Sharia Law, what was it really like?" is impossible to answer as not a single group, country, entity, etc., is even coming close to being a decent representation of Sharia Law. Yet, Redditors go into their patented Islamaphobe frenzy like flies around shit. My question is pertinent to literally everyone. Yet, Reddit turns into crickets. As you said, very few even realize the true definition, aim, and scope of Zionism.

       Zionists aren't the only ones abusing their power.  They may be at the top of the food chain, but I seriously doubt this, personally.  Not to excuse their misbehaviour or anything - they just seem like a convenient front to keep eyeballs off the other bad actors.
