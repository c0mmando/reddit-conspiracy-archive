Sure they &quot;let us&quot; use wind and solar power as well, that is the controlled opposition. They know that these technologies are fairly inadequate and not a real threat. </p>

<p>Also, the energy companies have figured out how to extract maximum benefits in terms of favorable tax credits, concessions, etc. for going along with the plan of converting to renewable energy at a pace which will never really allow a conversion to take place.</p>

<p>There are countless whistle blowers, scientists and researchers who have explained having the dark side show up and destroy the equipment and/or kill people as soon as you fire up your perpetual motion machines, cold fusion generators, torus-based generators, reverse-engineered extraterrestrial technology, etc.</p>

<p>It makes me so angry when I think about all the crimes perpetrated against humanity. We must overthrow our corporate overlords.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Modern physics is being proved wrong every day. It&#39;s funny this argument is still being tossed around. We should strive to break our modern understanding of science, yet so many stubborn people think we have reached all the understandings we need to.</p>

<p>Bull shit.</p>

<p>Modern physics is built upon false mathematics on purpose, so that it would hold off free energy for humanity as long as possible.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t believe me?</p>

<p><a href="http://awakeningforums.com/thread/300/pulling-energy-vacuum-thomas-bearden">http://awakeningforums.com/thread/300/pulling-energy-vacuum-thomas-bearden</a></p>

<p>We live in an abundant universe but are taught to believe everything is finite and you can&#39;t produce net gain electricity. This is the biggest lie in physics.</p>

<p>I can provide you with dozens of links but the above linked video does a pretty great job.</p>

<p>Also, there was a scientist at a university that managed to develop some kind of energy device from quartz crystals.</p>

<p>He fired it up, took notes that night at the university, and went home to bed. Next morning, he wakes up to a knock on his door, black SUV&#39;s, all his notes and research were stolen.</p>

<p>It&#39;s obvious that the cabal has the means and capability to pick up on the thumb print or signature of this and suppress the information.</p>

<p>There&#39;s countless articles, videos, information on this subject that I cringe every time I see someone ignorantly repeat &quot;but modern physics says it&#39;s not possible&quot;</p>

<p>We are on conspiracy damnit. Do some research man</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You don&#39;t get it man.</p>

<p>These devices give off a thumb print. If he made it again, they would have seen the signal created again and cracked down on it again.</p>

<p>If you want to develop this technology, you move outside the United States and go underground. I&#39;m not even kidding.</p>

<p>&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;</p>

<p>Mark McCandlish: I met a scientist who has since sort of taken himself out of circulation. He&#39;s vanished. His name was Mark Comings.</p>

<p>0 Mark McCandlish</p>

<p>He was a physics professor working as a teaching assistant at UC Berkeley, in their physics department.</p>

<p>And he had been . . . He&#39;d become aware of the fact that in the basement of the physics building on campus was a lot of this old surplus equipment – frequency generators and oscilloscopes and power generators – all these different kinds of things.</p>

<p>So he asked the head of the department if he could go down and just tinker and do some experiments. He had some ideas he wanted to play around with. And they gave him the okay.</p>

<p>So he had this idea that, as you may know, there are certain kinds of crystals, like quartz for example, that . . . It&#39;s the whole basis for the original phonograph record, the stylus.</p>

<p>When you would put a small crystal – I think it was like a diamond crystal – under pressure, it would create a mild electrical current. And if you amplify that current, you could then hear what the impulses were coming through that stone, that gem. And you could actually hear the vibrations that were recorded in a disk of plastic. That&#39;s how the phonograph works.</p>

<p>And so his idea was that, okay, crystals, when they&#39;re put under pressure – physical pressure – will create an electrical charge. But he wondered if you augmented the process by putting electrical coils that wrapped around the crystal, and you essentially applied an electrical pressure to the crystal, that the crystal would do not only the same piezoelectric process of creating an output of electricity, but that it might actually be more than what you would get with just putting physical pressure on it.</p>

<p>That by taking advantage of the lattice – the crystalline structure of this object, this stone – that you could then get it to resonate in a way that would kick out even more energy than you were putting into it.</p>

<p>And so he had a barium titanate crystal. It was about eight inches long, double terminated – in other words, a point on each side – had a cross-section that was kind of like a stop sign, sort of an octagon shape, had it fabricated by a facility outside the San Francisco Bay area where he lived.</p>

<p>And he had two different coils. One had a lot of fine windings, and another coil wrapped around the outside of that, all completely insulated, that had a lower number of windings.</p>

<p>And he experimented with putting a variety of different electrical charges, different voltages, frequencies, in different combinations, until eventually one night, about 1 o&#39;clock in the morning, working late on this apparatus, the crystal began to glow a bluish-green, and it began to ring.</p>

<p>You know how when you&#39;re at a wedding, and you take your glass – your wet finger on a champagne glass, and it makes that high pitched ringing sound? He said it was like that.</p>

<p>And he looked at the scale – the dials on his equipment that showed input voltage and output voltage.</p>

<p>And this thing was putting out 125% more – in other words, everything it was getting plus an additional 25% over and above what he was putting into the crystal.</p>

<p>Of course, he was very excited, you know, took his notes, shut everything down, went home, went to bed. And by 8 o&#39;clock the next morning, his house was surrounded by black SUVs and guys with ear buds and dark glasses.</p>

<p>They kick in the front door. They tossed the whole house. They arrested him. They confiscated all his notes. They confiscated his equipment.</p>

<p>And they basically said that they&#39;d found a closed circuit TV system that he&#39;d set up to view some of the women in the Phys Ed building, the locker room, the women&#39;s locker room in the next building. And, you know, he was in trouble.</p>

<p>And they wouldn&#39;t tell him what he was being charged with. They kept saying, “You know what you&#39;re charged with. You know what&#39;s going on here.”</p>

<p>And the reality of the whole thing was that he had created an apparatus that had accomplished what is supposedly impossible.</p>

<p>And I asked him, I said, “When you did this, when this thing finally worked when you found all of the right ingredients to make it work, do you believe that this thing put out some kind of a footprint in the environment that someone in the know was listening for and were ready to clamp down on?”</p>

<p>He said, “Absolutely, without a question.” He said, “Somebody triangulated my position, found out where I was, found the equipment, got ahold of the administration of the university, and they were at my house by 8 o&#39;clock the next morning.”</p>

<p>That&#39;s how fast it was. And so he&#39;s gone into hiding. And I&#39;ve heard that he&#39;s working somewhere in the Far East.</p>

<p>He&#39;s well-funded and continues his research, but all underground.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think you&#39;re making the connection here. If those findings were public, let alone accessible, the general public (or atleast people familiar with this understanding of physics) would be up in arms!</p>

<p>That&#39;s why this kind of information isn&#39;t public. Because the energy sector/the cabal would lose their means of profiting off something that should be free.</p>

<p>You realize energy is worth trillions of dollars? Free energy would revolutionize the world, and provide abundance for so many third world impoverished citizens.</p>

<p>You ask how I can believe this. I ask you, how can you not believe this?</p>

<p>How can you not believe that in this world of fear, control, anger, power, and money, that something like free energy would not meet resistance with those in the energy sector.</p>

<p>It&#39;s easy to demand scientific reviews, scientific journals, when reading shit like this. But you gotta realize man. Most the time, if something threatens a monopoly, it&#39;s going to be buried. Wether that&#39;s the war on drugs, or the energy sector, remains the same. Follow the money. Follow the power. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your hostile attitude really does no one any favors.</p>

<p>It&#39;s easy to scoff at the idea of free electricity, but instead of being a wet blanket about it and implying I should go build a free energy device and being a smart ass, put your energy into deciding for yourself if this holds merit or not.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not gonna hold hands and I&#39;m sick of people bashing others for things they think are plausible, but not themselves.</p>

<p>Do. Your. Research.</p>

<p>I used to think free energy was not possible. I had the same thought process as you.</p>

<p>Then, I actually looked into it, and verified it for myself.</p>

<p>So again, I implore you to research it yourself instead of wasting energy trying to hold onto the belief that it can&#39;t be possible.</p>

<p>I believe free energy is possible. And that is my opinion I have the right to have. I&#39;ve provided links, sources, and my own opinions. Now do your own work instead of attacking other people&#39;s ideas because you fear change and fear &quot;being wrong&quot; </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve told you three times man, I reached these conclusions by doing my own research. Watching videos on the subject. Taking notes. Reading into it.</p>

<p>I formed my own opinion, and my opinion supports what they are saying. I&#39;m not blindly trusting anything, except my own research I have already done.</p>

<p>Something I encourage you and anyone to do. Discernment, intuition, and your own understanding and opinion of things goes a lot further than someone merely telling you what to believe and handing it to you on a silver platter.</p>

<p>I&#39;d love for this type of information to be universally known, universally accessible. But we are a primitive species, and we move slow. At one point we believed cigarettes were good for us. So how can you tell me it&#39;s hard to believe in the idea of free energy? When looking back on history we&#39;ve made more than enough mistakes to realize we could be wrong, perhaps yet again?</p>

<p>I recommend the video above for starters. It lays a great foundation and can go more in depth than I will here in these comments.</p>

<p>Good luck to you and others in your pursuit of truth, but never bash someone else&#39;s version of reality or truth or reality filtering. We are all at different levels of awareness, perspective, and perceive reality in many ways, so trying to fit your version of reality into someone else&#39;s and saying they are wrong really does no one any favors. And I mean that for everyone really.</p>

<p>Good luck man! The truth is within you. I don&#39;t have it for you, and neither does anyone else. Searching outside of yourself for answers only proves you don&#39;t have the truth in the first place! Always go within and ask yourself.</p>

<p>Cheers, much love.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>OP&#39;s conspiracy theory seems like hogwash.  But, let&#39;s say that I did unlock the key to Zero Point Energy.  What should be my approach?</p>

<p>It seems obvious that in addition to the huge benefit I&#39;m giving the world, I should make some money from it, if possible.  So, I should approach big energy companies (eg. BP) to sell my ideas.</p>

<p>But, I think that I would need some way to ensure my own safety also.</p>

<p>Are there any legit sites I could upload my charts, diagrams, instructions, etc. with the instructions that they should be made public on a given date, unless I give a codeword to silence them?  If so, how should I use them?</p>

<p>These are open ended questions, here&#39;s what I would do if I had solved the world&#39;s energy problems:</p>

<p>I&#39;d put my detailed instructions on how to reproduce my results up with three different timers: 6 months, 3 years, and 10 years.</p>

<p>I&#39;d tell all the big corps that if they buy my technology, they would have exclusive access to it for 3 years.  I&#39;d start taking bids.</p>

<p>If I get a buyer, I would destroy the copy of the information that was guarded by the 6 month timer, and reset the 3 year timer to be 3 years from the date I gave my details to the winning bid.</p>

<p>The 10 year timer would have no kill code.  If I am unable to find a bidder within 10 years, the world gets my plans free of charge.</p>

<p>Well science can change it&#39;s mind and why ought I believe some guy on the internet over peer reviewed papers?</p>

<p>People have been trying to make perpetual motion machines for literally hundreds of years.  They aren&#39;t possible. Just like cold fusion, the people who &#39;did it&#39; lied to get attention and no ones been able to reproduce their results </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Modern physics is being proved wrong every day. It&#39;s funny this argument is still being tossed around. We should strive to break our modern understanding of science, yet so many stubborn people think we have reached all the understandings we need to.</p>

<p>Bull shit.</p>

<p>Modern physics is built upon false mathematics on purpose, so that it would hold off free energy for humanity as long as possible.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t believe me?</p>

<p>We live in an abundant universe but are taught to believe everything is finite and you can&#39;t produce net gain electricity. This is the biggest lie in physics.</p>

<p>I can provide you with dozens of links but the above linked video does a pretty great job.</p>

<p>Also, there was a scientist at a university that managed to develop some kind of energy device from quartz crystals.</p>

<p>He fired it up, took notes that night at the university, and went home to bed. Next morning, he wakes up to a knock on his door, black SUV&#39;s, all his notes and research were stolen.</p>

<p>It&#39;s obvious that the cabal has the means and capability to pick up on the thumb print or signature of this and suppress the information.</p>

<p>There&#39;s countless articles, videos, information on this subject that I cringe every time I see someone ignorantly repeat &quot;but modern physics says it&#39;s not possible&quot;</p>

<p>We are on conspiracy damnit. Do some research man</p>
