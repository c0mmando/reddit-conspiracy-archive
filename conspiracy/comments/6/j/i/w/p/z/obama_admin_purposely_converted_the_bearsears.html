        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">25</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2017-06-26 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/politicalbaron.html">politicalbaron</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>After the presidential elections and right before the end of Obama&#39;s term on December 28th, 2016 the Obama administration converted 1.3 million acres of land called the &quot;Bears-Ears&quot; into a National Park.  There was a huge controversy in the area because many locals who lived in the Bears-Ears area did not want it to become a national park.  Some locals were fooled into thinking that the sacred area full of Indian artifacts, paintings, remains, and historical monuments would be protected under the national park designation.  Lobbyists with money formed coalitions pretending to represent the Indians.  The Navajo of San Juan county initially supported environmental conservation efforts, but they were not told that the area would turn into a National Park, which would confiscate their land and give it to the U.S. govt.  So the local Navajo rescinded their support and actually protested in front of the state capitol to voice their opinions.</p>

<p>The Obama admin did this not to support the local Indians but to force the Trump admin to act by listening to the locals and modifying the park boundaries.  Trump recently created an executive order to look at all national parks because of this issue.  The Democrats quickly seized the moment to create news headlines to make it appear Trump was anti-environment and was destroying national parks.  Environmentalists quickly jumped on board against Trump not realizing the core issue was the Bears-Ears area being converted to a National Park, which the local Navajo and other residents oppose.</p>

<p>The conspiracy is that the Democrats purposely sabotaged the Trump admin by plotting to overreach the national park boundaries and upsetting locals causing chaos and forcing Trump to fix the problem.  Note that this was done right after the elections and before the end of the year.  Also note that there were protests against the Bears-Ears National Park proposal prior to the elections so it did not make sense to confiscate the land immediately for national park designation.  In addition, the local Navajo did not support this effort.  Money was involved and a coalition of Indians from outside the region was formed to make it appear there was Indian support when in fact, there was not.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why post an actual conspiracy here?</p>

<p>You should know by now r/conspiracy is a compromised sub that exists to gaslight people into believing this place is the last layer of truth.</p>

<p>In reality, every actual conspiracy I have ever seen posted here which seems credible yet politically inconvenient for democrats, it magically has a low vote count and numerous comments about how ridiculous it is (which is exactly what this sub exists to not do).</p>
