       I figured this would be the best place to find answers to this but here goes. My father is a fairly decent level mason, high 20's of what I've read to be 33 levels ... I am NOT a stone mason, I was adopted, so not born into it. I have a friend who is going around saying he is a high ranking member of the masons, he seems to know a lot of things I know to be true about the masons , but he could have easily been told by a mason ... but when I asked him about when he was initiated he said that he was not, he was born into it from a long family line of masons. Is this possible, or do all members have to go through the process ... this friend is also only 28, isn't rich and is known to .... stretch the truth....  it is my understanding that you have to be granted an application through one or more members of a lodge ... my father is Scottish Rite , my friend claims  to be Irish .... I don't know if rules vary each way ... but can anyone please turn this down so I can be certain he's full of shit? Lol.

       So any random on Reddit can come along and say
       <em>

       And you'll believe them?

       Whether your friend is telling the truth or not, i'm sure they'll laugh at this regardless.

       Well there are many places on the Internet that masons have answered questions before, just not this specifically ... I'm hoping that there is a knowledgable mason out there that can tell me, my father and I are not on speaking terms at the moment as he is not a fan that I am covered in tattoos lol... otherwise I'd ask him. If no one comes forward with information I'll let you all know at a later date when my dad gives up and realizes they're permanent and there to stay, and also that I'm 30, live 5 hours away, haven't lived at home in 11 years, am successful and not putting up with his shit lol

       You CAN leave stone masonry at any time you wish. I know this because my fathers lodge almost disbanded over a quarrel from the inside and the head grandmaster basically took their lodge until t was resolved and was willing to let a group of 10+ men leave Masonry forever.

       So we've had a few great posts by high level people doing AM(almost)A.  Seems the truth is, anyone can quickly work up to level 33.  Sounds like tasks you can grind out if you really want to.

       Why not ask your adoptive dad about it all?  The secrets they can't tell you are kept secret so as you learn things as you work your way up.  It isn't diabolical.

       Hey.  It's me.  :)
      </p>
      <p>
       Here is some more evidence.  William Cooper interviewing someone who claims to be a 32nd degree Freemason who infiltrated the lodge:
      </p>
      <p>
       [WC]: So most Freemasons, do they really believe that Freemasonry is a Christian organization?
      </p>
      <p>
       [WM]: No, no, they really don't. They may themselves be Christians and most in America are, but it is a strict rule and law of the lodge, written their own constitutions, that no discussions or debates concerning religion or politics ever be brought into the lodge. They do not want your Christianity broadcast, they do not want it mentioned at all. In fact I had a personal friend of mine, who was a police officer in the lodge of which I'm a member, and when he was asked in whom he put his trust, he said, “The Lord Jesus Christ,” and from that day forward, even though he's a law enforcement officer and vitally important to the New World Order, he has been ostracized, and he has been left out of many of the activities that got me to where I am in the Craft today. And I do not think that he will even be allowed to progress any farther because of that.
      </p>
      <p>
       [WC]: In fact, I think you told me the other night, that that was the first time that you ever heard the name of Jesus Christ mentioned in that lodge ever and is that true?
      </p>
      <p>
       [WM]: (laughs) Absolutely, or any other Lodge or any Masonic publication, or any writing, or even any words out of another Freemason's mouth. It is just not part of their vocabulary. In fact, I have very firm beliefs that the name itself brings actual pain to their ears.

       Is this only at the lodge?  I've been to church with Masons as well as dinners where they've said grace and they can definitely say Jesus outside the lodge.

       I dunno man, my dad still attends church , he definitely says Jesus, as do many of his Masonry friends ... as do a few of the others that have told me about this believing in a higher power, and if I ever spoke of Lucifer my father would not be appreciative of it. And the folks that I also know that have told me of this, are not Lucifer worshipers ... I have read many things from AMAs on other sites and in books and the masons all seems to say that your faith may vary , but it is just you must believe in a higher power. However...... to the rest of the world that doesn't know that Lucis stems from Latin meaning "The Light" , they may be wary to anyone who says that they worship Lucifer, so that maybe a good way of concealing beliefs to save face with the general public. I am neither sure nor unsure.

       Hey.  It's me.  :)
      </p>
      <p>
       Here is some more evidence.  William Cooper interviewing someone who claims to be a 32nd degree Freemason who infiltrated the lodge:
      </p>
      <p>
       [WC]: So most Freemasons, do they really believe that Freemasonry is a Christian organization?
      </p>
      <p>
       [WM]: No, no, they really don't. They may themselves be Christians and most in America are, but it is a strict rule and law of the lodge, written their own constitutions, that no discussions or debates concerning religion or politics ever be brought into the lodge. They do not want your Christianity broadcast, they do not want it mentioned at all. In fact I had a personal friend of mine, who was a police officer in the lodge of which I'm a member, and when he was asked in whom he put his trust, he said, “The Lord Jesus Christ,” and from that day forward, even though he's a law enforcement officer and vitally important to the New World Order, he has been ostracized, and he has been left out of many of the activities that got me to where I am in the Craft today. And I do not think that he will even be allowed to progress any farther because of that.
      </p>
      <p>
       [WC]: In fact, I think you told me the other night, that that was the first time that you ever heard the name of Jesus Christ mentioned in that lodge ever and is that true?
      </p>
      <p>
       [WM]: (laughs) Absolutely, or any other Lodge or any Masonic publication, or any writing, or even any words out of another Freemason's mouth. It is just not part of their vocabulary. In fact, I have very firm beliefs that the name itself brings actual pain to their ears.
