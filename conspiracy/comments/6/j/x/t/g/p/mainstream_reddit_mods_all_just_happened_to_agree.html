It didn&#39;t use to be this way. There used to be discussions, not 10-15 word responses to ruffle feathers, insult and misdirect. Maybe it&#39;s just our culture changing but whatever it is it&#39;s bad. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I did manage to document some <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/WayOfTheBern/comments/6fpiwe/new_type_of_sneaky_censorship_in_popular/dijz53z/">questionable activity</a> in mainstream subs.</p>

<p>There is clearly a bot that deletes comments from some users, but <em>only</em> if you comment in a popular thread. I am not sure about the exact threshold, but my experiment was commenting in a thread that reached r/all and a thread that only got 4 upvotes.</p>

<p>My comments in a poplar thread were instantly deleted (multiple times), and comments in a thread with low upvote count stayed without any issues.</p>

<p>Instant deletion means that it is clearly a bot. The exact reason they do this to me is open to interpretation, but there is no good explanation for <em>why</em> they have a bot that works like this to begin with.</p>

<p>It is clearly not to protect the users of the sub or to enforce the rules, otherwise they wold either ban me or delete <em>all</em> my comments, not only the ones in popular threads.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Every discussion about the video is so illogical. Look at the one on r/uncensorednews for example then compare with other subs. So many comments say almost the same thing with slightly different wording. Even when a redditor does find the video or r/all the immediate impression from ALL the comments gives the illusory impression that it doesn&#39;t matter what the media writes regarding Trump/Russia because they have moral high ground due to Trump being guilty of Russian collusion (without evidence) </p>

<p>The last 5-6 years I&#39;ve watched the large subreddits become a fountain of opinions that all point you to the same conclusions, tell you how you should feel about something. Then it went full patio with the big revision to how r/all works and plethora of new subs. </p>

<p>I think it is a huge deal, it can have sever ramifications from a campaign-finance standpoint since churches are exempt from many reporting requirements. There is a reason the Johnson amendment is in the tax code.</p>

<p>More senior controlled mods remain more passive, only stepping in to defend he agitator if necessary, in order to preserve seniority ranking on the mod list.</p>

<p>Eventually genuine mods get tired of the daily battle in mod channels, or personal targeting/harassment, or life happens and they leave the team. More mods are hired on to take up the load which is where additional compromised mods get in. Repeat the process.</p>

<p>Now most accounts are compromised mods. Everything becomes Democratic majority vote wins. Long standing founding mods can get singled out and kicked out at this stage. The harassment campaigns intensify and as soon as someone blows up fingers are pointed for why to remove them from the sub.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was scrolling through the politics and worldnews subs the other day and it was literally endless pages of anti Trump posts. This was on a day that had only good news about Trump, and terrible news about dems and the establishment in general...but not one single positive Trump post, and not one single negative post about the dems/establishment. </p>

<p>It has reached the point where they simply stopped caring about allowing any dissenting opinions. Rather than try to fight them with shills, or even basic debate between two people, they have decided to go 100% authoritarian. </p>

<p>This is going to backfire and has already. The majority of people on reddit already lean left anyways, so their resources being spent on bots and shills is going to waste only reinforcing already cemented opinions. The few who are still questioning things and are more in the middle can see this bias, and reach out to other sources or subs like T_D for some kind of alternate viewpoint. Often times this leads to conversion. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s one big sub for conservatives. R/conservative is a joke. R/politics is huge and completely liberal. Try posting some conservative shit in any main sub. You&#39;ll get clowned immediately. Go ahead, make a pro trump meme and post it to Advice Animals. If you are unaware that Reddit is mostly full of liberals, then obviously you aren&#39;t spending time on any of the most populated subs.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That still doesn&#39;t mean anything.  If you are trying to push &quot;memes&quot;, you will get &quot;clowned&quot;, because memes are dumb.  They are funny, but not intelligent.  Not many, at least.  And if the &quot;popular&quot; subs are so biased, you have to wonder why, especially if you do believe that politics is a load of bull to begin with.  Didn&#39;t the DNC show us that as best as they could?</p>

<p>Why is r/conservative a joke?  And why are you SOOOO interested in the discussion on this sub for being such a short time user?  Inquiring minds want to know!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No one here cares for your tone, viewpoint, casual ignorance of most of what people say, and starting arguments about nothing, really.  I would argue most of reddit is fully CENTRIST at heart, and that is why I am on here.  The popular subs are liberal, because the mods made them that way.  Tell me, how often do you hear about Trump&#39;s connection to Nikola Tesla, one of Reddit&#39;s favorite people to talk about, especially on r/conspiracy? </p>

<p>And this video has nothing to do with the political make-up of Reddit, at all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Liberals know all about O&#39;keefe and his antics. He&#39;s been doing this shit for years. Why don&#39;t you go post the video to r/politics and see just how much great value it is to the liberals over there. I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll totally shock them. </p>

<p>The video is corny because it makes a big deal out of nothing. Some guy that works at CNN health said CNN focuses a lot on Russia because it&#39;s good for ratings. No shit Sherlock, the president is under a criminal investigation. Fox talked about Hillary&#39;s investigastion all day every day for months because it was good foe their ratings. News is a business. What a shocker. </p>

<p>Then after being asked a thousand times if the story was mostly bullshit, this dude says it &quot;could be, don&#39;t have a whole lot of evidence yet.&quot; So that&#39;s his opinion. Cool beans. CNN didn&#39;t make up Russia. They didn&#39;t male up these criminal investigations. They didn&#39;t hire Flynn and Manafort. They didn&#39;t send Kushner to meet with Russian bankers. But they sure as hell report on it because it&#39;s juicy as hell and good for the ratings. This isn&#39;t even unethical. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I never said they &quot;owe&quot; me anything.  Why would they &quot;owe&quot; anything to anybody? Focusing on a &quot;story&quot; is a top-level choice, but there are plenty of ethics behind those decisions, and not good ethics either.  But they should not be able to label themselves as &quot;news&quot; if what they are presenting is a false narrative.  THAT IS WHAT PEOPLE HAVE A PROBLEM WITH.

    <div class="md"><p>Bullcrap, it is selective information release, and harmful to humanity as a whole.  News implies information, not drivel.

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, they report on things that have had virtually no closure, and propagandists hype up the worst case scenarios, all while doing a poor job of it.  I don&#39;t watch, and it isn&#39;t informative or entertaining, and i actually think they are propagandizing THEMSELVES out like whores because they are dying.  As their sphere of influence shrinks, they are talons out trying to scrape together some semblance of importance, even if it means shitting on themselves, pardon my language.  But it&#39;s really the lack of intelligence that is a giveaway.  If a clip from a &quot;news&quot; outlet can turn you off in seconds, it&#39;s best to steer away entirely.  From personal experience.  Local news, while similarly shoddy, at least has some element of humanism to it.   </p>

<p>isnt what I said.</p>

<p>What I said was <strong>if you hate him</strong> ask yourself why, and be honest.</p>

<p>I actually would call his tweets obnoxious, belligerent, ballsy, and brazen. Bold, and possibly impetuous.</p>

<p>You characterize his tweets as &quot;immature&quot; and show him to be &quot;unprepared for the job&quot;.</p>

<p>First of all, he is a grown man over 70 years old who has been in the public eye as a (mostly) self made billionaire for decades.  Prior to this campaign, I dont know if you know his history, but he was rich and famous, and nearly universally well liked.  He didnt become the inhuman monster until ---POOF-- the media portrayed him that way. That should tell you all you need to know right there.</p>

<p>As for how his tweets appear and read, you may rather have maturity and &quot;preparedness&quot;.  But the people who voted him in didnt <strong>WANT</strong> a politician, they didnt want someone polished, prepared, scripted. They literally WANTED someone obnoxious who didnt give a flying fig about convention and what he was supposed to do. Because only THAT kind of personality could fight the system and have any chance at making the changes that were being demanded.</p>

<p>You may not get it, and I would guess you arent an american. If you judge him harshly for his tweets, well at least to me you base your feelings on what he truly says, so I cant argue with you on that.  The mainstream media of course tries to tell everyone what each tweet <strong>really means</strong> and what he is think and feeling, and they hate that he tweets at all, so do realize that with 140 characters to work with Im not sure what he tweets comes out exactly as he would intend every time, but thats at least the raw him.</p>

<p>And if you dislike him on that basis, I wont attack you for it, but it doesnt change my initial point re the media.</p>

<p>I think you are imagining every trump voter to be an impassioned supporter, when I suspect a considerable percentage voted for him because he WASN&#39;T HILLARY CLINTON, and the low voter turnout, loss of the popular vote, and low approval ratings seem to indicate that as well.</p>

<p>At the end of the day, he is taking time out of his day to STILL attack the person he defeated in an election on a semi regular basis, trying to blame democrats for obstructing bills they are physically incapable of obstructing, and really hasn&#39;t actually accomplished very much of his agenda. No wall is being built.  No one has &quot;locked her up&quot;.  Health care reform appears dead in the water because hes never gonna get the hard core &quot;No healthcare ever&quot; wing of the party on the same side as the &quot;if we take away healthcare completely we wont get re elected&quot; side.  The travel ban is sort of in place?  Pending a SC hearing.  </p>

<p>He got gorsuch through.  Which is something.  Except that seat will likely forever have an astrix by it due to the senates refusal to even vote on Garland, which I suspect history will not view kindly, as it essentially set the stage for no president ever being able to put someone on the supreme court without control of the senate as well.  </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>I suspect a considerable percentage voted for him because he WASN&#39;T HILLARY CLINTON</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think this is true.</p>

<p>HOWEVER, my initial point was the unmasking of the media to be complete propaganda and a massive smear campaign. Are you American? If you are then you know Trump was popular prior to running (for issues aside from politics, which he wasnt a part of except as a donor). If you arent, then you know what the media has told you since the campaign started, which is, as you put it &quot;horseshit&quot;. And this incredible over-the-top hatchet job during the campaign by the media - once they realized to their horror that he could win - surely turned just as many people into rabid Trump <strong>haters</strong> who wouldnt be if they knew what he was like from honest reporting.  And in a similar way, dont believe the &quot;approval ratings&quot; that are put out, they are put out by the same useless turds that gave Trump a 2% chance to win the election, and they are as reliable as those predictions. WHY? Because they are PROPAGANDA intended to produce an outcome, not honestly report anything. This isnt rocket science.</p>

<p>If you see things clearly, and again not just as the leftstream media tries to portray them, Trump has done or at least attempted nearly <strong>ALL</strong> of what he promised. Anything not completed yet has been the result of congressional and judiciary slow walking and obstruction, which is of course by design and intentional, the swamp does NOT want to be drained.  His legislative agenda is very simply not in his power to enact on his own. He has very limited powers as granted to the chief executive, and even those have been under constant attack, for political reasons of course, damn the actual average american. Every roadblock SO FAR has been because of congress or the judiciary. You cant blame Trump, he is head of the party only in name, most them are VERY anti Trump, as for true Trump-agenda loyalists, there is a very tiny minority, that is the reality like it or not. So at least lay the blame where it belongs.  Healthcare is a good example. He cant do it himself.</p>

<p>One thing I look forward to is bouncing out the congresspeople obstructing his agenda, because regardless of what the leftist media says, his agenda is what the average american WANTS!!! Its why they voted for him!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>ok, so that means you ARENT american.</p>

<p>If you were, you would know that he was very popular. I grew up admiring him and following his various ventures.</p>

<p>A friend gave me an autographed copy of Art of the Deal many years ago, way before he even talked about politics.</p>

<p>I was a little dismissive as to some aspects of his business success - like for example the fact that he was essentially handed $1M seed capital by his father and his father also let him take over his already massive NY real estate empire, so he isnt truly &quot;self-made&quot; - but I knew him to be a master at branding and promotion, and again no matter what the leftstream media tries to say <strong>NOW</strong>, he had a hit reality show and was popular.</p>

<p>He didnt become the great Satan until he began running and even then not until the media realized he could win.  And then, all of a sudden, he was this, he was that, he was racist, he was a predator, it would have been funny if it wasnt so disgusting.  Even now because the media calls him liar 24/7, so many people just assume this is true.  It isnt. <strong>THEY ARE  PROPAGANDA</strong></p>

<p>And I know you get an even MORE extreme version outside the US, its all CNN all the time.</p>

<p>So keep on hating if you will, but know this - the media is propaganda and do not blindly trust what they say.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>lol.  Ok buddy.  And you haven&#39;t bought into ANY propaganda at all.</p>

<p>No.  I&#39;m not american.  But I lived there for a decade.  And I live a 4 hour drive away from there now.  </p>

<p>Guess what?  We get ALL of your media sources here.  All of them.  Always have.  If you genuinely believe that Trump was universally liked by anyone but wanna-be rich douche bags prior to his presidential run, I suggest you take a long look in the mirror at yourself.</p>

<p>By the way, for someone who apparently came of age jacking off to a guy with a comb over, you sure dont seem to actually know much about his history, seeing as art of the Deal was released in 1987 and he was openly talking about running for president in 1988.  So unless your friend was  traveling back from the future you didnt get an autographed copy of art of the deal &quot;way before he even talked about politics&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And do not blindly trust what your media says either.  That&#39;s the problem. You dog people who &quot;trusts the media - but you follow and blindly trust as well.  FOX is a 24/7 protrump commercial.  If that&#39;s all I ever watched, I&#39;d think Trump is Godlike just like you do. You can constantly accuse everyone of disliking him because of the (left wing) media, just know that you are a blind hypocrite for doing so. </p>

<p>It&#39;s funny to hear you make him sound like a hero or something. He&#39;s a dirtbag &quot;businessman&quot; who stiff people left and right. Are you denying the actual stories of people - from their own mouth - that said he fucked them over? And because he had a hit reality show and was &quot;popular&quot; you want people to be convinced that he&#39;s not who we all see him to be? </p>

<p>And yeah - I agree.  It is pretty disgusting that he&#39;s a predator. When he makes comments like the ones he mad in that bus - he&#39;s a predator. No need for Anderson Cooper to &quot;PROPOGATE&quot; that. </p>

<p>So if works both ways.  You wanna points fingers at left wing media for all the &quot;hate.&quot;  Then I will point to your ultra right wing pro trump media and accuse you of being blind too. It&#39;s either that / or you re just really young and immature.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, I see what you mean. Its certainly MUCH more plausible that an actual billionaire with a successful reality show (so he is <strong>literally rich and famous</strong>) throw that ll away - FOR NO GOOD REASON - knowing that he, and his family, will be ruthlessly (verbally) attacked in the media and his (and their) personally safety even threatened.....all because he is so evil and such a loser.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not sure how you measure &quot;universally well liked&quot; - was he somewhat successful - yes (had he just put his fathers money in a fund that grew along with S&amp;P 500, he would have done better), and he did have a hit reality tv show - does that translated into &quot;universally well-liked&quot; - not so sure. In any event, well before the mainstream media decided to portray him as satan, he made the pivot all on his own, from businessman/entertainer to conspiracy theory, Obama-birther nut job. I even remember him on Howard Stern well before he was running for President, and Howard was begging him to stop with the conspiracy theory stuff because he was ruining his own reputation/legacy and turning himself into a laughingstock. </p>

<p>With regards to his Tweets - if there is some issue where the 140 character limit makes it hard to know what he meant or intended to mean, perhaps, he could use some other method of communicating directly to the people that doesnt have a 140 character limitation. Just think, if he didnt limit himself to 140 characters, perhaps there would be no misunderstandings.</p>

<p>I think his tweets are hilarious, and most of the time right, even though when he makes them the media goes nuts. THEY <strong>hate</strong> that he can end around them and speak direct. Its awesome. Makes them irrelevant, and leftists HATE that. Loss of control.</p>

<p>Is he <strong>always</strong> right? nope. And some of the stuff he says is obnoxious and turns out wrong, he isnt perfect. But great example - him tweeting about Obama surveilling his team. Media goes nuts, another accusation of liar, blah blah blah, on and on for days.</p>

<p>Months later, who was right? Its a huge scandal, he WAS surveilled, just as he said. OOOOPSIE!! Sorry left wing media! Caught out once again! Such losing!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, he DOES frequently edit his videos in a way to make people look bad and put together quotes in a way that tells a story that the conversations might not have reflected. He uses the same tactics as Michael Moore. Even appears prominently in his own videos to make himself the star.</p>

<p>If he wasn&#39;t doing that, then he&#39;d be releasing unedited, slightly redacted conversations to prove that he was on the up and up.</p>

<p>Just as an example, this video shows a guy unaffiliated with CNN politics or news that is expressing a personal opinion about the way they do things, but if you introduce it by saying he is just a CNN producer and hint that he&#39;s talking about policy instead of opinion, then it looks much more damaging.</p>

<p>If you want to make the argument that contemporary news exists primarily for ratings, you don&#39;t exactly need this video to do it. Not to downplay what&#39;s being said, but the bottom line is that it&#39;s not a smoking gun. Sure, this producer is expressing opinions consistent with what most of us who pay any attention at all to how the news works already agree with, but it&#39;s not going to bring down CNN.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Of course what people have been saying is O&#39;keefe has paid people in the past to say things on camera and pretend they were totally caught out. This kid being filmed wasn&#39;t in a position where he would ever touch a story that had vaguely to do with Trump or Russia. </p>

<p>Just look at it this way. This PV guy totally randomly ran into a CNN producer, who totally trusted him out of the blue for no reason, who just happened to repeat literally every single Trump team official talking point. PV is also funded by Donald Trump himself. </p>

<p>Oh and it just happened to drop on the same day that the CBO scored the healthcare bill as dog shit. </p>

<p>Now either this is the craziest occurance of coincidences ever. Or O&#39;keefe paid another kid to act for him. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>CNN already acknowledged the individual and supported him having his own opinions.  Thats pretty much all the video was.</p>

<p>The reason it was of interest is because this guy <strong>IS</strong> a CNN producer, not a dept that would handle a russia sotry, but not a low level grunt either. So his educated opinion carries some weight. The stuff he said Zucker said is credible. He didnt &quot;repeat every Trump talking point&quot;. In fact, he was somewhat noncommital. If he was paid, he could have been FAR more damning and convincing.  To say he was paid is a pretty weak sauce defense.</p>

<p>You dont want to believe it, because you dont want to. Thats fine. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The other bullshit strawman I see is people deflecting from the CNN producer&#39;s authority by repeatedly saying he&#39;s only in charge of reporting on health issues.</p>

<p>As if the top CNN producer covering health would be incapable of attending meetings with the CEO wherein he was directed, along with the other top producers, into covering Russia.</p>

<p>And as if he also wouldn&#39;t be privy to insider CNN knowledge of some kind of Russian evidence that wasn&#39;t being shared publicly. Or the habits of his peers when such leaks can be confirmed: that they get published loudly and broadly.</p>

<p>Bullshit strawmen everywhere. What kind of accusation is &quot;Russian collusion&quot; anyway in our globalized modernity. Countries are illusions for the poor masses. The rich have no borders. Well, fewer anyway.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your reasoning doesn&#39;t make sense. Tmz reports 1000 things a week no one listens to. And just because CNN said it was was thier employee doesn&#39;t mean anyone will listen. Like it or not no one trusts O&#39;Keefe any more and very few will listen to what he has to say. Just look at any other thread on a different sub reddit, no one cares because no one trusts O&#39;Keefe anymore.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The piss tape(s) was never debunked.  The fact is, a respected and reliable intel source claimed it exists, and the MSM refused to report on it because the report was unsubstantiated by hard evidence.  However, it&#39;s easily the most researched thing in the Steele dossier, and the President spent an inordinate amount of time personally asking the FBI Director to investigate it, long after most of us assumed it was fake.  The president&#39;s own interest in the recordings is what certified their existence to me.  Up to that point, I also had assumed it was debunked.</p>

<p>At this point, enough of the Steele dossier has been corroborated that we have probable cause to believe the piss tape to be genuine.  The Senate and the intel agencies are acting under that supposition.  Remember- Ted Cruz and the GOP commissioned the dossier, and John McCain leaked it.  So, it&#39;s not like this is some crazy left-wing conspiracy.</p>

<p>The only reason Trump has supported the hard-line GOP agenda is that they own him.  If he loses the vote of 10-15 Republican senators, he can be successfully impeached.  He&#39;s just their little tool until they decide they&#39;d rather have president pence.</p>

<p>Politically, the President is dead in the water.  His party controls both houses of Congress, the Supreme Court, and the White House, and these dumb motherfuckers are still so incompetent that they can&#39;t get their agenda through.  He has zero political capital at this point, and he can&#39;t even protect republicans who sided with him in the election from being targeted by right-wing ads.</p>

<p><strong>Losers.</strong>  Lolz, lemme know when you&#39;re sick of winning.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>that article didn&#39;t mention the possible piss tape at all.  It specifically said that a particular part about hacking was unverified raw intel, which was acknowledged as such in the dossier, and it was only part of his third dossier delivery when he started delivering for the Clinton camp. The piss tape is part of the original dossier, and it&#39;s sourced by about a dozen contacts.</p>

<p>If you read the dossier, and you read the Comey docs (which the President has now himself stated are the truth), you can see that the piss tapes likely exist.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Again, it was not &quot;debunked,&quot; no matter how much people say it was debunked.  Debunking would mean it was proven false, which hasn&#39;t happened, much to the president&#39;s chagrin.  However, it hasn&#39;t been proven absolutely true either, merely suggested as being likely.  As I&#39;ve said, there is probable cause to believe that it exists, and it hasn&#39;t been proven false.  If there&#39;s a 40% chance that the President of the United States is being blackmailed by a foreign power, that&#39;s a big deal.  But then again, you spend a lot of time circlejerking on thedonald, so I don&#39;t really care about your ignorant opinion. I&#39;m only engaging with you so that others can see the some holes in your arguments and viewpoints that I see and aren&#39;t misled by your sycophantic lying.  Your typical MO: post an old story from the rightwing fake news, claim something was debunked months ago, and act like you have credibility. </p>

<p>If you wanna defend the_doofus, feel free, but you&#39;re not in your circlejerky ban-happy rightwing troll safe-space anymore, so get used to being called out for being wrong af.  Tell me- what does the President think about healthcare and marijuana, and what has he done to further those policy goals.  Why does Donald support Paul Ryan, the cuck of cucks, like a little bitch?  Why does he nominate Jeff Sessions, who&#39;s just a racist drug warrior, a gnomey HR Haldeman drinking sweet tea?  The hypocrisy is downright scandalous all on its own.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve spent a large chunk of my life debating against fatuous &quot;conservatives&quot; such as yourself.  I&#39;m from the south, so it&#39;s nothing new to me.  While Trump may seem new and special to you, he&#39;s just an uglier version of the same bullshit that has kept America down in the world for years.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;ve linked to one article that said that it was unverified with further hard evidence.  That does not make it false; see my above post on what &quot;debunked&quot; means.  And take a moment to remember, this is r/conspiracy, not r/politics.  This is a highly speculative sub.  Based on info that has been made public, as well as certain things I&#39;ve been privy to in my own dealings, I&#39;m specifically alleging a criminal conspiracy between the president of the united states and a cabal of foreign billionaires led by a sociopathic dictator.  A dictator whose representatives the president invited into the Oval Office, to whom he personally proceeded to give highly classified intel from our allies.  I think I could probably lay out everything for you, connect all the dots, and you&#39;d still say that the argument doesn&#39;t hold because I don&#39;t have video evidence.</p>

<p>But, and I&#39;ve said this before, there&#39;s a special prosecutor on the case, we&#39;ll all find out soon enough if there&#39;s more meat on these bones, and we shall see how this turns out.</p>

<p>In the meantime, I suggest you read <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/republicans-are-risking-becoming-the-party-of-putin/2017/06/28/78e8e1ee-5c24-11e7-9fc6-c7ef4bc58d13_story.html?utm_term=.4c3130d2a84d">Evan McMullin&#39;s new op-ed piece on Russia and the GOP.</a></p>

<p>He said Obama wiretapped him and he&#39;s had to back off on that. </p>

<p>He said Russia didn&#39;t interfere, now he&#39;s backed off on that. </p>

<p>He said his health care plan would cover everyone, he&#39;s backed off on that. </p>

<p>He questioned the &quot;One China&quot; policy and then backed off on that immediately. </p>

<p>He said he&#39;d have a plan to defeat ISIS, he doesn&#39;t. </p>

<p>He said he&#39;d institute a Muslim ban, then backed off to call it a &quot;travel ban&quot;, and the latest SC ruling indicates at least part of even that won&#39;t pass. </p>

<p>He talked about ditching NATO, he&#39;s backed off that too. </p>

<p>He abandoned calling China a &quot;currency manipulator&quot;. </p>

<p>He attacked Hillary about connections to Saudi Arabia and then he sold them billions in weapons. </p>

<p>Hell, how about his huge one, he&#39;s backed off on going after Hillary for indictment. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Chris Steele isn&#39;t just some yokel.  He&#39;s a Five Eyes intel operative.  When he vets something, it&#39;s as good as intel done by our own people.  Like I said, he&#39;s classified as a reliable source.  Intel sources are rated as 20% reliable, or 60% reliable, or just plain reliable.  If you read the dossier, some claims he admits are less verified than others, but the piss-tape/kompromat intel is pretty much the most vetted thing in there.  Sources that he trusts within FSB claim to have seen the kompromat themselves.  Enough so that John McCain, a Republican who has seen his fair share of intel dossiers, believes it to be true enough to leak. </p>

<p>But it doesn&#39;t really matter what I say or think, there&#39;s an FBI special investigation currently underway, and I await their findings into the matter.  If Mueller exonerates the President of any wrongdoing, then I&#39;ll happily admit that I&#39;m wrong and that our nation has not been infiltrated at the highest levels by a foreign adversary.  We shall see.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not about someone being good or bad at intel. That&#39;s never really the case. The problem is that one of the functions of intel agencies is to spread propaganda, and you never know if you&#39;re getting the truth. These people could say anything and only they, legally, have the right to know the truth.  You shouldn&#39;t be trusting anyone, certainly not these types of people or McCain. Unless they show something, their word is worthless.</p>

Conservative subs and posts show up on r/all front page all the time. You&#39;re just wrong. The reason its not at the very top is because its not a bombshell and never will be, cnn is not going anywhere and the republican producer said generic shit that wasnt all that fascinating. Tv channel works for ratings? Republican thinks trump investigation is fake? Yeah nobody gives a shit.</p>

<p>Not to mention james O&#39;Keefe gave himself the public perception as a con man by getting his ass beat in court for trying to slander planned parenthood with another doctored video payed for by rich republicans to rile up the voter base. If you&#39;re a decent human being you should never support a guy whos been guilty of doctoring videos and peoples speech to push a political narrative. That is lowly EVEN if it did not occur in this video. Why would you ever post a guys videos when he has a reputation like that? He should not be rewarded for any of his future work.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It was the #1 trending video on all of YouTube today.  Now it sits at #3. </p>

<p>1.6M people have watched it just on the PV channel alone.  It should be front page news.  Especially since it&#39;s a major political &quot;news&quot; scandal... bigger than the day before when CNN fired three people for making fake news.  </p>

<p>Part two is due out around noon today and it&#39;s supposed to be even more salacious.  Pay attention this time to CNN&#39;s fellow leftist media allies and their orchestrated efforts to downplay and/or censor.  Then head over to the &quot;politics&quot; section and watch as its vote count stays at 0 and eventually gets removed.     </p>

    <div class="md"><p>They acknowledged that he <strong>did say</strong> those things, which kills all of the leftist defenders 1st line of predictable defense, which of course would be that the video was somehow doctored.  Im sure that has been posted already, I guarantee it. CNN wrecked that.</p>

<p>So you are now down to level 2 of defense, which is O Keefes reputation. Like that makes any difference. Predictable and sad, but irrelevant. The produycer said what he said, and it shows very clearly that even the people <strong>AT</strong> CNN know that the whole russia thing is nonsense.</p>

<p>Thats the point, I know you are frantically, desperately trying to spin it otherwise, but this was evidence, if nothing else, that CNN is a dirtbag outfit, all else aside.  Zucker is out, guaranteed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Liberals know all about O&#39;keefe and his antics. He&#39;s been doing this shit for years. Why don&#39;t you go post the video to r/politics and see just how much great value it is to the liberals over there. I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll totally shock them. </p>

<p>The video is corny because it makes a big deal out of nothing. Some guy that works at CNN health said CNN focuses a lot on Russia because it&#39;s good for ratings. No shit Sherlock, the president is under a criminal investigation. Fox talked about Hillary&#39;s investigastion all day every day for months because it was good foe their ratings. News is a business. What a shocker. </p>

<p>Then after being asked a thousand times if the story was mostly bullshit, this dude says it &quot;could be, don&#39;t have a whole lot of evidence yet.&quot; So that&#39;s his opinion. Cool beans. CNN didn&#39;t make up Russia. They didn&#39;t male up these criminal investigations. They didn&#39;t hire Flynn and Manafort. They didn&#39;t send Kushner to meet with Russian bankers. But they sure as hell report on it because it&#39;s juicy as hell and good for the ratings. This isn&#39;t even unethical. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Of course what people have been saying is O&#39;keefe has paid people in the past to say things on camera and pretend they were totally caught out. This kid being filmed wasn&#39;t in a position where he would ever touch a story that had vaguely to do with Trump or Russia. </p>

<p>Just look at it this way. This PV guy totally randomly ran into a CNN producer, who totally trusted him out of the blue for no reason, who just happened to repeat literally every single Trump team official talking point. PV is also funded by Donald Trump himself. </p>

<p>Oh and it just happened to drop on the same day that the CBO scored the healthcare bill as dog shit. </p>

<p>Now either this is the craziest occurance of coincidences ever. Or O&#39;keefe paid another kid to act for him. </p>

<p>It really <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6ja7uo/jake_tapper_calls_out_dncs_bs_on_russia_hacking/djcqb77/">stands out</a> compared to submissions on just about any other topic.</p>

<p>And there is a pattern that shills likely will never be able to avoid, and that will keep giving them away. Most downvotes come in early after the submission, and the upvote percentage you will see in the 1st 10-20 minutes will be very different from what you&#39;ll see in a few hours.</p>
