    <div class="md"><p>This is hilarious. The last dying gasp of a reactionary regime. Pure Republican propaganda that means nothing but trying to crush those who don&#39;t perfectly comply with the Republican Oligarchy.</p>

<p>Fact one: James O&#39;Keefe is paid six figures a year by Republican oligarchs to make deceptive videos to discredit political &quot;enemies&quot; and specifically by the Donald Trump campaign, the oligarch Robert Mercer and his outlet Breitbart, and the Koch brothers and their Donors&#39; Trust Dark Money organization. </p>

<p>Fact two: James O&#39;Keefe&#39;s political &quot;enemies&quot; are Democrats and only Democrats or their supporters.</p>

<p>Fact three: James O&#39;Keefe got into legal trouble and political trouble for faking a video about Acorn and misleading people about Planned PArenthood.</p>

<p>Fact four: James O&#39;Keefe has been a highly paid political infiltrator of CNN for years now.</p>

<p>Fact five: Donald Trump supporters consist of a large pluraity of the population -- possibly as many as one in three.</p>

<p>Fact six: CNN is a large company with thousands of employees.</p>

<p>Fact seven: given probability and enough time, James O&#39;Keefe was bound to find a Donald Trump supporter working at CNN.</p>

<p>NOTHINGBURGER.</p>

<p>And what are we supposed to learn from this? We are supposed to learn something we already know -- that CNN is bad. One great form of propaganda is to deliver something to &quot;prove&quot; their beliefs -- then to use that to distract from reality.</p>

<p>Reality is:</p>

<p>James O&#39;Keefe supports the Current Government in Power -- something that we haven&#39;t seen here at Conspiracy until recently. James O&#39;Keefe masks his well-paid support for Republicans in scandal and subterfuge. The <em>real</em> reason that James O&#39;Keefe supports Republicans (aside from his six figure paycheck) is because he wants MORE REPUBLICAN POLICIES.</p>

<p>And that&#39;s what is missing from these games of finger-pointing and corruption ...</p>

<p>Republican policy is to end Medicare, Medicaid, all regulation, sell of the United States to unaccountable oligarchs, fully privatize and monopolize the internet, etc.</p>

<p>In other words, Republicans want to take us back to the societal structure of the 1800&#39;s. This is the end game.</p>

<p>Hmm, well, depends if Israel has stated objectives in American Government/Politics...</p>

<p>&quot;America is a thing you can move very easily...&quot;</p>

<p>Is Israel friend or foe? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>a 34-year cover-up of Israel&#39;s air and sea attacks on the National Security Agency spy ship USS Liberty June 8, 1967, killing 34 and wounding 171.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Odd that Israel and the NSA patched things up after that incident. Good thing they can share your data now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I simply noted you were using <em>buzzwords</em>. Try to use some higher brain function. If I defended 1488, it would be a rational defense. Much of the buzzwords you are using are irrational. Remember calling people  &quot;Trump Cultists.&quot;</p>

<p>The words being tossed around are very cult like. I said you sound like you were brainwashed with an Antifa manual. This is because its verifiable Antifa is being funded by NGOs, for the sole purpose of destabilization. Surely you can see the rational and logical reason of why that is not good for a country. </p>

<p>As for &quot;far right&quot; &quot;the right&quot;, or &quot;alt-right&quot;...the Alt-Right never existed. It was a fiction made by Hillary&#39;s campaign to discredit her detractors at the time. Currently it&#39;s been co-opted. By who? No idea. Maybe break that story and you can really bring them down.</p>

<p>1488, and the rest are silly memes. Some made by people genuinely thinking themselves satirists and Im sure some Black Propaganda. Anyone stupid enough to fall for that or glorify that is stupid. </p>

<p>Thats my defense. No defense. If you use it you are an idiot. If you vilify it, you are in the same boat. Use higher brain function. Live life.</p>

<p>Most liberals don&#39;t even know this but I do because I spent time learning about the new right wing ideology. Blaming Hillary for the term alt-right when Richard Spencer exists is the last straw. You can comment at me, but I won&#39;t be engaging with you anymore. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Already said the &quot;Alt-Right&quot; was co-opted immediately. It wouldn&#39;t be surprise if it was planned from the beginning. </p>

<p>Timeline: Hillary detractors building large numbers</p>

<p>Hillary&#39;s campaign website labels them alt-right</p>

<p>Suddenly &quot;personalities&quot; pop up. Spencer et al. No one identifies with them or knows who these people are within the anti-Hillary group.</p>

<p>They are essentially two groups. One organic, one manufactured. Now Poes Law is taking effect and people are falling for the meme.</p>

<p>I&#39;m happy to hear you don&#39;t consider CNN to be real news. By Bonifield&#39;s own words CNN&#39;s constant baseless reporting on Russia is for the ratings, therefore taking themselves out of the news industry and into the entertainment industry. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly!!! CNN doesn&#39;t actually care about causes or issues, they just want more money and ratings and the Russia story gives them that. It&#39;s easier to eat people outraged about Trump/Russia than it is about police militarization and never ending wars, which is ridiculous to me. The government has been stripping our rights and solidifying their power for decades (centuries?), but that gets ignored because it doesn&#39;t get the ratings or the clicks. It&#39;s fucking ridiculous. CNN, Trump, Fox, and Hillary are all pieces of shit because they&#39;ve all allowed/created the massive government powers that destroy our rights as American citizens. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is hilarious. The last dying gasp of a reactionary regime. Pure Republican propaganda that means nothing but trying to crush those who don&#39;t perfectly comply with the Republican Oligarchy.</p>

<p>Fact one: James O&#39;Keefe is paid six figures a year by Republican oligarchs to make deceptive videos to discredit political &quot;enemies&quot; and specifically by the Donald Trump campaign, the oligarch Robert Mercer and his outlet Breitbart, and the Koch brothers and their Donors&#39; Trust Dark Money organization. </p>

<p>Fact two: James O&#39;Keefe&#39;s political &quot;enemies&quot; are Democrats and only Democrats or their supporters.</p>

<p>Fact three: James O&#39;Keefe got into legal trouble and political trouble for faking a video about Acorn and misleading people about Planned PArenthood.</p>

<p>Fact four: James O&#39;Keefe has been a highly paid political infiltrator of CNN for years now.</p>

<p>Fact five: Donald Trump supporters consist of a large pluraity of the population -- possibly as many as one in three.</p>

<p>Fact six: CNN is a large company with thousands of employees.</p>

<p>Fact seven: given probability and enough time, James O&#39;Keefe was bound to find a Donald Trump supporter working at CNN.</p>

<p>NOTHINGBURGER.</p>

<p>And what are we supposed to learn from this? We are supposed to learn something we already know -- that CNN is bad. One great form of propaganda is to deliver something to &quot;prove&quot; their beliefs -- then to use that to distract from reality.</p>

<p>Reality is:</p>

<p>James O&#39;Keefe supports the Current Government in Power -- something that we haven&#39;t seen here at Conspiracy until recently. James O&#39;Keefe masks his well-paid support for Republicans in scandal and subterfuge. The <em>real</em> reason that James O&#39;Keefe supports Republicans (aside from his six figure paycheck) is because he wants MORE REPUBLICAN POLICIES.</p>

<p>And that&#39;s what is missing from these games of finger-pointing and corruption ...</p>

<p>Republican policy is to end Medicare, Medicaid, all regulation, sell of the United States to unaccountable oligarchs, fully privatize and monopolize the internet, etc.</p>

<p>In other words, Republicans want to take us back to the societal structure of the 1800&#39;s. This is the end game.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>LOL so you really think the &quot;left&quot; is &quot;done&quot;. </p>

<p>You think those people are going to vote for Trump in 2020 or what? </p>

<p>What exactly does that mean, &quot;your time is over&quot;. The left just got done with 8 years of a president beloved around the world. Republicans are the ones with Trump as their face. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>We weren&#39;t talking about Trump - even though SA is a destabilizer in the region, the Trump deal was done in public, not secret emails. There&#39;s no relevance besides your obfuscation.</p>

<p>We were talking about spying. You implied that noting the Israeli spying operations was anti-semitic wherein I responded with criticisms of SA (simply showing criticisms exist not just for Israel). </p>

<p>This was in response to you claiming some kind of existential spying threat from Russia. </p>

<p>Try to stay on track.</p>
