<p>is definitely not &quot;something spewed by the MSM&quot;, it&#39;s my original thoughts. Yet it was 60% downvoted in the first 60 seconds after I posted it! WTF. It&#39;s not enough time to even read the first paragraph.</p>

<p>Now it&#39;s picking up a bit, but I&#39;ve heard that the first 3-5 votes make all the difference and basically decide if the post will be visible to people or not..</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is random chance. Your post is the perfect example of a post which will always get upvoted in the long run. As you can see in other posts on here, there are non-believers who are here just to mock us and convince us of the mainstream narrative, and these are likely the people who downvoted your post. The ratio of these non-believers to real conspiracy posters will determine if you get upvoted initially or not.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s true, but the fact that they make posts here insulting anyone who believes in certain conspiracies and have subs dedicated to mocking posts they find here make it seem possible that they are real. Also I think another reason people initially downvoted your post is because it had the word lizard in the title, and they instantly assumed it was associated with a conspiracy theory they disagree with, without even reading your post.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t really know if any of them are being paid but it wouldn&#39;t surprise me. A lot of times people just don&#39;t see things the way others do. You don&#39;t have to pay people to believe something.</p>

<p>This place is very divided but there are strong contingents who believe certain theories. The problem is, these contingents believe them to such a feverish degree that they likely downvote what they don&#39;t agree with.</p>

<p>I&#39;d think the book sellers have a lot more to gain by hawking their information with some bots getting their message to the top than the MSM would by messing around on here.</p>
