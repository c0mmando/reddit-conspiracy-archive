       Any post that is actually conspiracy related and offers an interesting link to research, and not just something being spewed by the MSM gets upvoted. Somehow some of these MSM posts still end up making it to the frontpage after a few hours though anyway.

       is definitely not "something spewed by the MSM", it's my original thoughts. Yet it was 60% downvoted in the first 60 seconds after I posted it! WTF. It's not enough time to even read the first paragraph.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now it's picking up a bit, but I've heard that the first 3-5 votes make all the difference and basically decide if the post will be visible to people or not..

       It is random chance. Your post is the perfect example of a post which will always get upvoted in the long run. As you can see in other posts on here, there are non-believers who are here just to mock us and convince us of the mainstream narrative, and these are likely the people who downvoted your post. The ratio of these non-believers to real conspiracy posters will determine if you get upvoted initially or not.

       I find it hard to believe that real people are dedicating their lives to obsessively refreshing the NEW page, just to downvote everything out of spite. But then I'm constantly being surprised by how strange some people can act ;-)

       That's true, but the fact that they make posts here insulting anyone who believes in certain conspiracies and have subs dedicated to mocking posts they find here make it seem possible that they are real. Also I think another reason people initially downvoted your post is because it had the word lizard in the title, and they instantly assumed it was associated with a conspiracy theory they disagree with, without even reading your post.

       It was lizard in the topic. Lizard, Flat earth, and anti vaccer are destined for down votes. even if they have a good premise.

       I didn't down vote that post, but I saw it when watching /new, read the title, clicked through, scanned the beginning and decided I couldn't commit the time to fully read it.  (It'd practically be a full time job to read all content posted here)
      </p>

       The length of the post, with no quick 'summary' to catch my interest, is why I skipped over it. I'm not posting this to say it's bad content or anything, just giving my thoughts since they may mirror others'.

       Plenty of discussion is had in the proper contexts.  People who will outright dismiss anything (like you are with discussions) obviously don't help create the right context.

       There are some people who come here with the "muhrussia" thing and questioning Seth Rich's murder at all is dumb. I believe these folks are paid. Anyone really interested in conspiracies would be able to parse these subjects with at least a degree of curiosity. Shutting down questioning is not why we come here.

       Some people here do shut down questioning though. That's why it's hard to have discussions. It's a lot more than just the Russia, and Seth Rich stuff too.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't really know if any of them are being paid but it wouldn't surprise me. A lot of times people just don't see things the way others do. You don't have to pay people to believe something.

       Divide and conquer.  We're much easier to divert and suppress if our energies are split amongst two lesser forums.

       I always try to browse
       <a href="/r/new">
        /r/new
       </a>
       here and honestly some times you will see the same content with a different title get posted a bunch of times. I donwvote duplicates or if the titles are the same I will take a look at them and see if it looks like something that is just bullshit or posted by bots. but really a lot of the posts on
       <a href="/r/new">
        /r/new
       </a>
       are junk old news or non conspiracy related or some echo chamber bullshit from td or anti td.

       Almost everything here is being shilled in one way or another.

       This place is very divided but there are strong contingents who believe certain theories. The problem is, these contingents believe them to such a feverish degree that they likely downvote what they don't agree with.

       I'd think the book sellers have a lot more to gain by hawking their information with some bots getting their message to the top than the MSM would by messing around on here.
