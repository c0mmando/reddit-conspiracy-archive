       Guy said in Iowa that he would rather have a rich person in his cabinet than a poor person. It's "the kind of thinking he wants". A rich person who only knows how to be rich and keep his money and self from failure is the kind of thinking he needs.

       I've tried to not put too much stock in the looks or acts guilty thing. If he is innocent of everything and being politically slandered, he would definitely act this way regardless. I just don't see the point of constantly bringing these issues up. There's a purpose to aligning the terms "collude" and "obstruct" with Obama, basic counter-accusation. Would make more sense if Obama was the leading Trump-Russia cheerleader, but he hasn't made a single statement tying the two together in deviousness. It does make sense that he appears to support the Russian interference claims only once a lengthy article was written in which the Obama admin looks weak or incompetent. Claiming that this was done with some devious political goal in mind seems absurd though, just convenient spin to feed his base, a specialty.
      </p>
      <p>
       This does make me think he's trying to get ahead of coming stories, framing the narrative preemptively.

       That's been my thinking all along. That regardless of if he has colluded with Russia, whatever we end up deciding that means, I think he would react in these same stupid, reactionary ways. I would not be the least bit surprised if Trump got impeached for obstruction, but then was found to be innocent. People are being mean to him, and he wants it to stop!

       This is exactly my point. I think he keeps trying to do this over and over while deflecting. Comey testified under oath that Trump came to him to talk about Russian hookers being fake months after the fact. He keeps bringing it up and paying attention to it.

       As for resistance, it just depends on who is the president at the time. Right wingers were ready to go to war because Obama was a muslim destroying the country.

       at this point, it's being shoved down everyone's throat, so there's obvious resistance to that narrative. I do think that where there's smoke there's sometimes fire....but right now all the media coverage is too much.  It's burning everyone out

       No fire. Lots of smoke and now they are changing their tune.

       At first it was election meddling! Now its Russian ties! Why? b/c they couldnt prove election meddling. DNC wont even turn over their server. (Sidenote how the f is the fbi taking no for an answer? If it was anyone else they would kick in the door and take the server..)
      </p>
      <p>
       The American people can tell when its a real claim and spin doctoring.
      </p>
      <p>
       When most of the wealthy democrats have ties to Russia as well people tend to shrug and ask the real issues:
      </p>
      <p>
       wages, cost of living, cost of housing, jobs, environment.
      </p>
      <p>
       But the corporate democrats are too busy furthering perpetual war for their donors and using it, they think, as ammo for the next election.

       He did, but it was ignored by his base, and he has since brought up the FBI not examining the DNC servers thing multiple times, and that's one of the most common talking points made by Russian interference deniers. Not that it's not a relevant point, but when he brings it up he fuels that counter-fire. He's gone back and forth on it subtly.

       Russia is one of the few countries fighting the Zionist world order. That's why they are demonized. Enough of this anti-Russian propaganda on this sub. I'd rather have Trump be friends with Russia than Israel, but apparently that's too evil for liberals. We'll never have peace with Russia because you people keep falling for the propaganda

       Wikileaks is fed from Russian intel. Just read what a member of Pussy Riot said about it.

       A claim like Seth Rich was the leaker is an absolute statement. You seem pretty confident in that knowledge? May I see your proof so I may be enlightened?

       Julian Assange hinted that Seth Rich was the leaker in this video:

       WikiLeaks even offered a reward for info on his death. Also, Kim Dotcom confirmed that Rich was the leaker, and kim is a known affiliate with WikiLeaks.

       It's because Trump is a narcissist. He
       <em>

       the idea that people think anyone but HIM is responsible for his victory. Remember how pissy he got when people started talking about how Bannon got him elected with his brilliant media strategies?

       This is very true, while at the same time anything that goes wrong or is bad in any way, he is never at fault. Good? All his doing. Bad? Anyone but him. Alot of people admire this quality in leaders, I think it's a 15 year old football stud's way of portraying themselves to the world.

       Other presidents and leader-type figures have utilized this strategy, including Hilldawg. But man, Trump is making it an art form.
