    <div class="md"><p>Trolling and shilling are not the same. A shill is basically a paid marketing position, whereas a troll is simply trying to get reactions out of people. So a paid shill could be very polite and represent their company in a non-trolling manner. </p>

<p>I would disagree with this. First, as a shareholder (and I think no longer involved in operations at all), he&#39;s not really being paid by Microsoft. But even if he were, I wouldn&#39;t consider that to be shilling. At least in the traditional sense of the word, shill implies the person is paid but makes the appearance of having no financial connection. </p>

<p>So I wouldn&#39;t consider a PR person for Microsoft or any other company advocating their products or services to be a shill, but I would if it were a person providing a positive review without disclosing a financial arrangement. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know what the difference is. Trolling and shilling are treated the same, that&#39;s why I said both. </p>

<p>Also if you looked at previous shill campaigns (Correct The Record), a lot of the shilling is actually just trolling. They can be the same thing in a way. I mean obvious shilling is the guy that only posts about how great Coke products are. Political shilling is usually trying to downplay (troll) certain narratives and only push other narratives. </p>

<p>For example, people that only post about one political party&#39;s problems, but then downplay/ignore their side&#39;s problems are usually shilling, but doing so with trolling tactics and mannerisms. However they could just be a political activist, but not a shill. Usually the burden of proof for shilling is pretty high, but trolling tactics are usually public and easy to see. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Be very careful people. Shill accusations break rules and will be removed and the user may be banned if egregious.</p>

<p>However, there is nothing in the rules that says you can&#39;t <em>prove</em> it. Just remember, the burden of proof for this is going to be high. Like higher than most of what we generally accept as proof around here.</p>

<p>You should also try to keep your language as respectful as possible. You make a fantastic case against a guy and call him a &quot;lying ugly motherfucker that should be hung&quot; 20 times, you are just breaking a ton of rules, and you kill your own case on a technicality.</p>

<p>Do not take this as an invitation for witch hunting. And this is my personal interpretation of rules that anyone else is perfectly able to override.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are easier ways to out shills than overtly proving it as well. Play to the skeptical nature of this sub and be nice while doing it. Make sound arguments and don&#39;t pretend to know more than you do. The regulars here will see the same things you do.</p>

<p>I have seen a number of user handles come and go over time. They lose patience when it becomes obvious they are treading water.</p>

<p>At the same time, try to recognize the true believers. Not everyone who disagrees with you has an agenda.</p>

<p>I had a similar issue the other day in the thread about the mars rover being fake, where I refused to take a side pretty much, and one user took that as me clearly being opposed to their stance. It didn&#39;t bother me, but I could see how it might someone else. </p>

<p>I simply said &quot;I don&#39;t pretend to know&quot;, and they took that as a slight that either they WERE pretending to know or that I was disagreeing with them. It reminded me of the kind of arguments I would get into with girlfriends in high school. </p>

<p>I notice you bring up my comment, but not the ones I removed. Ok</p>

<p>I mean, if the mods are readily available to help people fish for IP addresses, how can users who go against the dominant narrative feel like speech isn&#39;t controlled here. That is crazy to me. You basically said that my controversial standpoint causes people to call me a shill. I&#39;m wondering if it has anything to do with emboldening people to actively hunt for people they think are bots. And why do they think they are bots? Because they don&#39;t think pizzagate is real and refuse to bow down to the fash. </p>

Because I see a bunch of concern trolls here all the time they usually start their posts with phrases such as , &quot;Friendly reminder&quot;or &quot;an open letter to&quot; or something along those lines. Do you know what I mean ? It&#39;s like people think that if they post all day and night non stop they are some kind of hero or activist. When in fact people look at that like damn does this person have a life or is this their life , if this is their life I feel really bad for them and hope they get better, sending positive vibes to hose poor people </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Most users that reach a certain level of karma will use an alt account to argue , fight , name call and be disruptive so they don&#39;t ruin that precious karma they have accumulated on their main account. We should call them coward accounts instead of alts. Then you have users that have several accounts because every time they open their fucking mouth around here and disagree with the narrative/s of the week they get banned .

    <div class="md"><p>I just caught your meaning with the honeypot. That is a funny idea, and would probably be especially funny to anyone that is actually familiar with me around here. </p>

<p>Hell, maybe it can be? I think all the shill accusations are as much of a problem as the actual shills. If the low effort &quot;everyone that disagrees with me is a shill&quot; kinda users were gone, would you object to that?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Accusing another user of being a troll or shill can be viewed as an attack, depending on context.</p>

<p>But maybe Rule 2 is the one you should best familiarize yourself with:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>No accusations of rules violations in comments. Please report violations.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Can someone explain why any of that has any bearing on his message? If he literally just told you to check his own post history where you would inevitably see what this guy posted - surely he knew it would happen.</p>

<p>So how the fuck does any of that have a negative effect on his message? Don&#39;t we all benefit?</p>

<p>lol, for a conspiracy sub, people around here critically think for about 3 seconds.</p>
