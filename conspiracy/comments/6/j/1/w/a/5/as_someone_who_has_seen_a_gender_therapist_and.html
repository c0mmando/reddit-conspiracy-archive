        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Apologies for my terrible writing, I&#39;m really tired/sick right now.</p>

<p>Hi. I&#39;ve never been much of a conspiracy theorist, but after thinking about things that happened to me a few years ago, I think I may have nearly been taken advantage of by nefarious actions from the pharmaceutical  industry. I really want to get the word out, and find other people with similar experiences, and this sub seems like a good place to start.</p>

<p>I went to a very stereotypical high school, with all the standard cliques and shit you would expect. I was, and still am, not a very masculine person and because of this I didn&#39;t fit in. I was far more intrested in music, fashion, anime and film than sports or &quot;getting pussy&quot;, which made me an outcast. As a result, I struggled with self esteem issues, and generally was confused and annoyed for most of this time. Then, when I was 17, I found something that made my life make sense: transgender forums. These websites told me that my feelings were classic transgender feelings, and that I needed treatment immediately. Over the next years I began the process of changing my gender. I saw a &quot;gender therapist, attending support groups, and even put myself on the waiting list for female hormones. Then, when I went to University, I got a wakeup call. There were loads of guys like me, who may not act like the &quot;manly man&quot; ideal, but still have no intention to change there gender. That&#39;s when I realized that I was going down a dark path, and quickly abanded the idea of me wanting to become a girl. </p>

<p>During my year in the transgender world, I noticed some things that made me uncomfortable. The following is common retoric from support groups, forums and therapists.</p>

<p><strong>Everyone who feels confused is transgender</strong>. If you make a single post on a transgender forum saying you think you might be trans, you will be validated in those feelings. No matter what the story, whether it&#39;s about enjoying &quot;female&quot; intrests, or something that sounds more like a sexual fetish than a legit medical condition, you are trans according to the user&#39;s.</p>

<p><strong>Any gender non-conforming is proof of trans status</strong>. Like certain movies, music or TV? You are trans. Like wearing bright colored clothes? You are trans. Have more female than male friends? You are trans.</p>

<p><strong>You are trans, and don&#39;t trust anyone who says otherwise</strong>. The most common complaint on these websites is that doctors are &quot;gatekeeping&quot; them. Anyone who doubts you in your feelings is evil, and you should lie and cheat your way into getting the treatment you &quot;need&quot;.</p>

<p><strong>Asking questions is evil and dangerous&quot;</strong>. Trans people commit suicide all the time, and asking any questions about trans ideology just makes the problem worse. Accept what we say, or gtfo.</p>

<p><strong>If you are trans, you are amazing</strong>. Trans people love boosting their own and each other&#39;s ego&#39;s. When you are a depressed teenager who doesn&#39;t fit in, this can be huge.</p>

<p><strong>So where&#39;s the conspiracy?</strong> </p>

<p>When someone takes the hormones they need for &quot;treatment&quot;, they are prescribe to expensive medication for life, one that requires lots of medical attention. These people are cash cows for the medical industry. Unfortunately, there are not a lot actual transgender people in the world today. So why not make more? I think that big pharma is shilling forums and paying off doctors and therapists to convince people that they need these hormones.</p>

<p>The average trans person, when discussing there time before transition, fits a simple mold. An awkward nerdy teenager who doesn&#39;t act like a stereotypical manly guy and doesn&#39;t fit in with jocks and &quot;tough guys&quot;. However, that description probably describes a large portion of the population. That&#39;s where the medical company&#39;s take advantage of people. By convincing competely normal and healthy people that the need help during a low point in their lives. High school sucks for people like me, but once you leave it gets better. University and the real world isn&#39;t high school. But pharmaceutical companies are convincing people that the problem isn&#39;t that high school sucks, but instead they are suffering from a serious medical problem, and they need treatment now.</p>

<p>What are your thoughts on my theory? Do I have a point, or am I just rambling?</p>

<h1>** TL:DR: Big pharma is using the internet to take advantage of insecure yet competely normal teenagers and create lifelong customers**</h1>

    <div class="md"><p>From 8th grade until 12th grade I wore boys and men&#39;s clothes pretty much exclusively, and at the time there were a few other girls who did the same. It was partly not being secure with my body but also just preferring the style of men&#39;s clothes at the time (and this was 15-20 years ago) and I hung out with what was called the &quot;skater&quot; crowd at the time.</p>

<p>After I graduated, I eventually and slowly started preferring more feminine clothes. I think partly because I started being more secure with my body and felt good wearing tighter clothes that actually showed my shape. That didn&#39;t fully happen until I was well into my early 20s!</p>

<p>It just makes me wonder if I was in high school <em>now</em> instead of back then when I&#39;d never heard of anyone my age being transgender, if <em>I</em> would have felt like I was the wrong gender since I didn&#39;t quite feel right in my body. Which obviously would&#39;ve been a huge mistake considering I&#39;m totally great with being a woman.</p>

<p>I just know that if I didn&#39;t quite feel comfortable and secure with my body until I was like 21 or 22, there <em>must</em> be others out there who are the same. It&#39;s pretty worrisome to think some teenagers could take hormones thinking they&#39;re the wrong gender because they prefer men&#39;s/women&#39;s clothes or simply have body image issues they will grow out of, when it&#39;s very possible they won&#39;t feel the same way in just a few years.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>THIS!!! From me too! I come from a time when &#39;gender&#39; was considered a social construct &amp; the solution was to accept individuals as they were. This idea that your genitalia define you seems crazy to me &amp; in fact a bit of a slap in the face to someone who has spent their life working against gender stereotypes in the workplace. I don&#39;t define myself based on my genitalia and no one else should either. I am me.
Saying a man who likes feminine things might be transgender is pretty much telling me that I should accept that I can&#39;t be &#39;me&#39; but instead must be all things that this word, &#39;woman&#39; (which is 99% a social construction &amp; 1% a biological definition) defines me as instead.
It&#39;s all bollocks, I say!</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Yeah I get that, but then if it truly doesn&#39;t define you then the idea of having to change it to feel complete doesn&#39;t make sense.</p>

<p>That&#39;s what drives me nuts about all of this, sex changing is basically cosmetic surgery. If someone feels the need to do that because they are not happy with what they physically can do or look like then I don&#39;t begrudge them their desire to do so but don&#39;t go telling my children that it will make them complete if they have a personality that doesn&#39;t fit in with societal expectations.</p>

<p>Even the little things like wanting to wear make-up or dresses or wear your hair long that doesn&#39;t make you a person who should be a woman, I don&#39;t wear make-up, I rarely wear dresses (been over two years since I have &amp; even though I wear my hair long &amp; have worn dresses that is for my husband&#39;s sake not because I am woman and like such things. </p>

<p>If the &#39;transgender&#39; movement wants to be effective they need to work on changing societies expectations of what it is to be a man or woman and cut the crap about wanting to be the opposite sex, because I am woman and I get pissed off by being told these people want to be a &#39;woman&#39; because by doing so they are backhandedly reinforcing all of the things society has tried to tell me I am supposed to be like that I have been fighting against all my life.</p>

<p>Okay I get it, maybe you want a dick or want boobs or want a vagina and you may want it for cosmetic reasons or because genetically you lean biologically more that way despite the equipment you were born with. That&#39;s fine, that&#39;s your call as an individual but the big problem is that the young are being told that if they don&#39;t fit the &#39;gender&#39; stereotype then perhaps they were born in the wrong body and that&#39;s bullshit. </p>

<p>If you want to be physically a woman or a man just for the physical nature of such an existence but aren&#39;t  that&#39;s fine but don&#39;t go confusing the &#39;idea&#39; of personality traits, likes &amp; dislikes of either sex with physicality as these are just prejudices of gender.</p>

<p>And I&#39;m not stupid, I get that some people are probably pushing this towards the young because if it is just a feeling of a physical lacking then you need to take action before hormones &amp; growth make some things irreversible but this sentiment is not what I am seeing in the media, it&#39;s he likes dresses &amp; being pretty &amp; girly things, and she likes football, playing with trucks &amp; guns &amp; wearing &#39;boys&#39; clothes, they should be allowed to become as much like the opposite &#39;sex&#39; as they like....nooo they should just be allowed to do the things they like and not be judged for it.</p>

<li>Gender is a construct, a &#39;performance for the gaze of the Other&#39; as it were. You wanna wear dresses or suits or makeup or fake facial hair, that&#39;s fine, but at the end of the day, you should be able to take your costume off and just be you.....If you get gender-reassignment surgery, you&#39;ve just permanently put on a costume you can&#39;t take off. We all wear a &#39;mask&#39; of sorts. All of us. The key is to learn to be happy with who you are...not change what you look like for the sake of others.</li>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree. But sex and gender are not the same thing. Sex is your genitalia and who you are physically. Gender is how you express yourself. Many people say that millennials are forcing labels, but labels simply make it easier to explain how they feel to others. If you say you&#39;re transgender, you are easily explaining that you feel like the opposite sex. Most trans people experienced dysphoria and get depressed that they don&#39;t look like the sex they wish to have. I&#39;ve never talked to anyone who forced a gender identity on a person, it&#39;s all been encouragement to figure out who they are and saying &quot;you do you&quot;. A lot of people say that millennial are making up genders and sexuality, but sexuality and gender is more complicated than boy or girl, straight or gay. Since the world is becoming more and more accepting, more people are feeling comfortable with coming out who they are. </p>

<p>there is also another great one, &#39;sexing the body&#39;

<p>Americans have only been exposed to a very narrow transgender identity. It&#39;s odd to me how it seems to keep getting narrower even as it popularizes and should become more broad/adaptive. </p>

<p>I studied sexuality and gender at college in 2005. This was right before transgender issues went mainstream. Most cultures have a &quot;third&quot; sex or understanding of a sexual spectrum. They don&#39;t &quot;embrace&quot; transgender people by telling them to mutilate their bodies in order to fit into a binary gender box. Americans need to educate themselves that the trans agenda worldwide doesn&#39;t contain mandatory sterilization and genitalia surgery. What is going on in the USA scares me FOR transgender people.</p>

<p>A therapist should be helping them get to a place where they accept and feel comfortable with their biological sex AND their psychological gender. The pharmaceutical response is reinforcing their pathology that there is &quot;something wrong with them&quot; (there isn&#39;t) and they need to &quot;do something&quot; to fix themselves in order to be acceptable (they don&#39;t.) It should be perfectly acceptable to have a drivers license with sex AND gender fields that cover everyone. It doesn&#39;t need to be so confusing ...so why is it in the USA? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for sharing your experience. I can definitely imagine these support groups and forums being little more than echo-chambers where the &#39;support&#39; is only available in one direction i.e. towards deciding to change gender. And I can imagine that someone who volunteers that they are having doubts about that direction would quickly sense a frosty chill from those who had formerly &#39;supported&#39; him/her.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I actually don&#39;t hear much about it anymore, but a few months ago it was a buzzword being pushed alongside &#39;fake news&#39; and I sometimes think about this concept for that reason.  It refers to a particular viewpoint - one I do not agree with - that somehow truth no longer exists in an objective way.  That as a society, everything is now valid and therefore anything goes.  I&#39;ve seen variations on the term, specifically &#39;post-gender&#39;, and have experimented with this concept myself when I speak of a &#39;post-money&#39; world.  It&#39;s a highly charged term for sure, I often wonder why it was being pushed so hard.</p>

<p>Now, I&#39;m not going to go and fact check every little thing because I don&#39;t feel like it, but I&#39;m pretty sure all that happened roughly in the last 100 years. </p>

<p>Also</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Similarly, sequencing the genome is a miniscule step compared to realizing DNA or cells exist <em>at all.</em> </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The discovery and model of DNA was also developed withing the last hundred years.</p>

<p>I NEVER denied we are &quot;standing on the shoulders of giants&quot; because the entirety of human history relies of the actions and consequences of the past to move forward. Obviously without simple inventions and concepts, more complex theories and designs couldn&#39;t be done. But to try and diminish the importance of all the work we&#39;ve done by saying it&#39;s not as revolutionary as the wheel is ridiculous and to claim our advancement in the last century hasn&#39;t been astounding or revolutionary is pure ignorance.</p>

<p>It&#39;s been a long time since we&#39;ve had a true groundbreaking discovery.  Everything is just small improvements and small steps forward.  A lot of that is because of the stifling effect of regulations and cartels, but most of it is just things happen in waves-- we have golden ages of discovery, then we all settle down to enjoy the results of the golden age.  We&#39;re in such a lull now-- we&#39;re taking the pioneering work of the men who learned to harness electricity at all, and simply adding higher resolution to electrical arrays.  We&#39;re taking the pioneering work of people who discovered DNA exists and all, and we&#39;re just organizing all the facts of it.  We&#39;re a generation of cataloguers and bookkeepers.</p>

<p>It&#39;s the next phase of these hierarchical victim politics that have been steadily and incrementally ingrained into our social fabric.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a denial of personal responsibility, self awareness, consequences. It is a rendering of the adult into a perpetual child of just enough competence to exist and survive within a system. </p>

<p>It is the attempt to equalize all things down to the lowest common denominator and the eradication of any true exceptionalism. It is the very oppression of all and their potential. Self improvement has been usurped by self promotion.</p>

<p>We don&#39;t treat depression by suiciding people, why treat gender dysmorphia by hacking off genitals?  Are you aware that the suicide rate among transgender people actually <em>rises</em> significantly after gender reassignment surgery?  How can you call that effective treatment?

    <div class="md"><p>It changed because the DSM-4 was outdated and not reflecting research accurately. Also the change should have happened when they went from 3 to 4 but it was held back by some peopled personal belfies instead of the science. It probably will change in the future as research continues just like every single classification in the DSM has and will continue to. Psychiatry is at a stage where our knowledge is rapidly increasing. We&#39;re unlikely to see a major change though. What were seeing lately is more of a focusing of the field as opposed to the huge paradigm shift we saw over the past couple decades. </p>

<p>Idk who you spoke to on this but the first step of any good psychiatrist will be to try hormone treatment and other ways of correcting any chemical imbalance that may ne causing such feelings. Surgery should and is treated as the last option and should take a couple years at least to reach as a conclusion. </p>

<p>As to why people who speak out are attacked its just human nature. In younger kids I&#39;ve noticed that their gender identity is part of how they define themselves. Criticizing the idea probably is just too close to criticizing them for people to approach it logically not defensively.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Rejection by friends and family increases suicide risk
Transgender people who are rejected by their families or lack social support are much more likely to both consider suicide, and to attempt it. Conversely, those with strong support were 82% less likely to attempt suicide than those without support, according to one recent study. Another study showed that transgender youth whose parents reject their gender identity are 13 times more likely to attempt suicide than transgender youth who are supported by their parents.</p>

<p>Discrimination increases suicide risk
Transgender people in states without LGBT legal protections are at higher risk of suicide. Other studies have found that transgender people who have been discriminated against are at a higher risk of suicide. What makes this worse is that discrimination against transgender people in health care, employment, accommodations, and housing is very common. Even in places with legal protections for transgender people, like Washington D.C., cultural bias and discrimination remains.</p>

<p>Being seen as transgender or gender non-conforming increases suicide risk
People who are seen as transgender or gender non-conforming are more likely to have attempted suicide. Also, people who have had access to surgery which allows them to “pass,” such as facial feminization surgery, report qualities of life not significantly different from the general population. This is perhaps the most damning study, since it strongly suggests that when transgender people are treated the same as cisgender (non-transgender) people, the risk of suicide becomes no different than for anyone else.</p>

<p>Those are the main parts I&#39;d feel are important, although I am sure there is a percentage of people that regret their change, most people are happier and feel that society feels they aren&#39;t people and they aren&#39;t accepted now for being them. </p>

But we haven&#39;t even stopped racism yet so who knows? But I definitely see your point, even though that ideology is what was tried for years before hormones and SRS became the accepted treatment. Maybe there is another treatment out there we&#39;ve yet to find that would work better, altering epigenetics but that little excerpt you showed me was not conclusive of a true treatment for everyone in any way, even if it&#39;s a start or idea towards one. Reducing dosage just brings back gender dysphoria at least in that specific case, it is in no way a real treatment or cure for the whole populous.

<p>So a depressed persons true self is a self loathing mess then.  Got it.  I can use this analogy for a myriad of diseases that require constant treatment that you would never consider their untreated condition to be their &quot;true selves&quot;.

That&#39;s my point, is that short of fixing the genes and receptors themselves without something that isn&#39;t hormonal which I said may be a possibility, treatment with transition is a real treatment or cure because it fixes the underlying problem. There are many arguments that can be made, but at this point in time modern medicine has accepted transition because it works the best most the time. If you truly believe you can find a better treatment or cure, become a scientist and do it. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>I would argue that it actually makes it worse.  The symptom is believing you are a different gender.  The treatment is making you a different gender.  That is like saying murder would be a treatment for suicidal people.  It exacerbates the symptoms, while at the same time doing nothing to address the underlying concern.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>I think that the treatment I linked appears to be a better course of action.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It&#39;s definitely a form of evolution though, as we figure out how to control all of our internal structures and fix them. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, it is not evolution in any way.  Like I said, evolution does not select for traits that hinder reproduction.  It may be a mutation, which can be argued is a precursor for evolution, but in this case it would be a dead end mutation.  It is not a trait that will be selected for through the process of natural selection.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But I was suggesting a spiritual evolution anyway.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I would say it is a spiritual disease.  If I believed in spirituality anyway.  As it stands, I am of the opinion that it is a physical disease, the treatment for which seems very Agenda based, and is close to a violation of ethics.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t get me wrong in all of this.  I am not advocating for discrimination.  I raise these questions from a place of empathy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, were going to have to agree to disagree here because were getting redundant and just see things differently. If you are right, we&#39;d need lots of studies on that drug, and possibly a different drug with a more direct mechanism of action before it becomes a widely agreed treatment. One case study doesn&#39;t make hypothesis in theory, although I agree it could lead to something tangible if studies were done. Thanks for the mostly polite discussion. Have a nice day and for providing another perspective&#39;s insight.   </p>

The surgeons lie and tell these teens they can cut nerves and all the sensation will still be there. Doctors lie all the time to make a quick buck.

    <div class="md"><p>I just want to say everyone is special and unique, existence doesn&#39;t make replicas because it&#39;s damn near impossible. It&#39;s how the capitalistic approach manipulates everyone into buying their crap that makes vulnerable and lonely people feel like they have to &#39;choose.&#39;</p>

<p>This is not a disorder, it&#39;s a social seclusion created by mass manipulation. By nature we have to &#39;belong&#39; to something to survive, it&#39;s part of being social animals. How advertisers go nuts and create their own culture is what causes the pharmaceutical industry to be able to provide a sense of belonging in exchange for money. </p>

<p>If we regulate their neglect of morality then we lose rights as well, so we have to recognize their bullshit for what it is and let it go. The destruction of family probably plays a significant role in this as well, because usually the family unit is enough to provide a sense of belonging and deep roots. But if everyone&#39;s working all of the time, there isn&#39;t any time to bond with loved ones.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lol, using pornography for masturbation necessarily means it affects a person, since it sexually arouses them.

<p>I think you give people far too much credit for distinguishing between reality and fantasy. I would agree that, sure, if you straight up asked most people &quot;do you think the scenes you&#39;re watching are real-life&quot; they would say no.

    <div class="md"><p>Aside from the retarded notion that people should inherit the sins of their fathers, all of human history is filled with people conquering other people- it&#39;s not specific to Europeans. Do you think Mongols, Arabs, etc. should be displaced in their own homelands too, or just Europeans?</p>

<p>And another thing, native Americans and Australians resisted being conquered- because that&#39;s what you&#39;re supposed to do. As far as I know, no one in the history of humanity has ever laid down and allowed themselves to be conquered. That would be pathetic.</p>

Almost everything good in this world was born out of European culture and you want to let it die because you feel bad that your ancestors were strong conquerors? If your dog got shot would you just be like &quot;meh, whatever, he deserved it for eating that rabbit.&quot; No you&#39;d probably be upset because you love your dog, despite that.

<p>This nihilism and apathy that has been fashionable for the last couple decades is starting to dissipate but sometimes I read comments like yours and it&#39;s just... lame. I guess none of this applies to you if you&#39;re not European but if you are then this is just a weak perspective.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I actually got in a heated argument in another forum for asking questions regarding transgenderism. I was simply asking IF this could be a phase someone is going through,or if it&#39;s actually something biological. I was attacked for asking some questions, trying to UNDERSTAND something that doesn&#39;t make sense to me, and I was quickly branded a transphobe, a gay-in-the-closest, and called many different names. This is my issue with the far-left or these SJW&#39;s. Anyone who DARES to question something is met with personal attacks and name calling. Let me tell you. I&#39;m a straight man. But growing up, I had a great relationship with my mother. So I&#39;ve learned to respect and appreciate women and the woman struggle. I&#39;m not a guy that supports stereotypes, but stereotypes is ALL i see lately, especially from those who DON&#39;T WANT TO BE STEREOTYPED. I&#39;m perfectly comfortable with my sexuality and I don&#39;t fall for the pressure from society to be this overly masculine dude who&#39;s only interested in sports, drinking beer and fucking pussy. Life is SO much more than that, regardless of age/gender/sex/sexuality/race. So, just because I&#39;m into Pop Culture and into Music(I actually studied Music in college), I was branded a gay because apparently, only gay people like Music/Pop Culture. Ironically, gays don&#39;t like to be stereotyped, yet they stereotype themselves. I was branded gay because I watched the TV show Desperate Housewives with my mom, growing up. Mind you, this show taught me a lot about women and how they are treated in society and how much they struggle. It made me really see life through their perspective. This trangenderism or all these SJW terms are confusing people, they are confusing teenagers and I fear for the new generation of kids who will have to grow up in such a confusing and all over the place, environment. Just because I can appreciate a show that centers around women don&#39;t make me want to be one. Just like, as a white man, watching and enjoying a show with all Black people don&#39;t make me wanna be black, or watching a show with gay people or lesbians don&#39;t make me gay. WE are the ones placing these stereotypes. Instead of finding this a GREAT thing, because THIS is how you bridge the gap between different groups of people, we take this as something to attack others or call them names. To finish this little essay, you having thoughts is completely normal. You liking &#39;feminine&#39; things is completely normal. It doesn&#39;t mean you want to be a woman, it means you are able to appreciate and enjoy many different things, not just those who are &#39;assigned&#39; to you by society. I&#39;m not saying transgender people don&#39;t exist, I&#39;m not saying it&#39;s not a thing. But it&#39;s like they are pushing it so hard, almost like forcing it on people, and with so much pressure from society and the internet, people get carried away by movements who THINK represents them. It&#39;s all too messed up tbh. </p>

<p>As an adult, the new SJW culture even confuses me and I&#39;m well past my formative years of it really impacting me. Growing up, kids my age used to throw around the word &quot;gay&quot; to mean that something was bad.  Most of us grew out of that as it became unacceptable, and the reasoning made perfect sense, but the new &quot;rules&quot; don&#39;t make the same amount of sense.  I&#39;m all for respecting people, but I&#39;ve stayed out of certain social interactions or stopped myself from giving positive compliments/feedback solely to prevent stepping on anyone&#39;s toes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It confuses me too. I watched a friend of mine in SanFran get called transphobic, because him (hetero-male) wouldn&#39;t be okay dating a trans women if she still had a penis. He was told he had to be okay with having sex with a woman with a penis, otherwise he&#39;s transphobic. In their mind, everyone has to be bisexual otherwise you&#39;re transphobic because you have a sexual preference.

    <div class="md"><p>gooble gobble...one of us - is how it goes in every echo chamber. </p>

<p>Good thing you realized for yourself that this is the wrong path, especially when it was for the wrong reasons, that you just not felt &quot;manly&quot; enough. You are a perfect example of things I always preach, that feeling &quot;manly&quot; has nothing to do with the propagandized image of a hairless, big muscle dude that still has the heart of an 8 year old boy.
This image is as fake as Pamela Andersons tits.</p>

<p>For men and women, nature defined what they could and could not do. The rest is in our heads and no body shape or cloth should define how we act.</p>

<p>I just don&#39;t understand what the endgame for trans people is. If I really feel so out of place in this world that I want to change from a man to a woman, is it really enough to only keep the charade up for the outside world? It&#39;s not that they menstruate, get pregnant, have a real pussy or female orgasm. It&#39;s just to fool other humans, but nature can&#39;t be fooled so after this realization I&#39;m not sure how trans people deal with the problem. If it doesn&#39;t matter, they aren&#39;t really female, right? So why all this work just to be a painted dude in female clothing? Because, if you want this, there are enough examples in history and recent past to not feel ashamed about it.</p>

<p>The simple idea, that we still have this very strict concept what men/women wear, should give you an idea about it, but it has nothing to do with gender. </p>

<p>Yes, thank you!! This is what I have the hardest time with. You can have the plastic surgery, the fake tits, the big lips, all the makeup, the long hair, the pretty dresses, but 4 or 5 times a day when you need to go use the bathroom you&#39;re still staring down at a penis. 
Even if you get it removed, you&#39;re staring at mutilated scar tissue made to look like a vagina, but it&#39;s <em>not a vagina</em>. </p>

<p>It never will be. How can walking around being a &#39;fake&#39; female possibly bring them that much happiness? Spending all that time, money, energy, just to live your entire life in a lie. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hi there OP. I&#39;m glad you turned away from a dark place. You should take your experience over to <a href="/r/gendercritical">/r/gendercritical</a>. There is plenty of info on the truth of what you&#39;re saying, and you&#39;re not alone in feeling like you have been pressured into making a huge life altering decision.
I have seen that big pharma companies are the platinum sponsors at transgender conferences, conferences ostensibly about &quot;finding out the real you!&quot; but &quot;better living through chemicals!&quot; is never far behind...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>True. That doesn&#39;t change the fact that pharmaceutical companies like Pfizer purposely downplayed the addictive properties of oxycontin and flat out lied about how long the effects last by 4 hours in most cases, keeping patients in a cycle of withdrawal. Not to mention spending millions lobbying doctors to prescribe this drug. Essentially creating a whole generation (I guess two generations now) of opioid addicts. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey look. It&#39;s my original point. These are powerful drugs that may get abused for profit to some degree (hormones much less so as they aren&#39;t addictive and are much cheaper), but in the end both have valid applications. There are many trans people that use hormones because we are trans, and there are some who are transtrenders or misdiagnosed. Addiction to opioids and misdiagnosed &quot;Trans&quot; people are both bad, but that doesn&#39;t invalidate trans people or people with debilitating pain, like so many here seem to suggest. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually they lose effectiveness over time. You build up a tolerance to it. Eventually a patient will develop more pain as a result of taking the drug because it no longer block the pain receptors adequately. The patient in agony returns to the md begging for more. It is not the lack of the opioid that causes the pain but in fact the opioid that is causing the pain. Doctors know this and then will switch to a nerve block or to a synthetic drug. Upping the drug will cause more pain in the long run and raging addict as well.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just because you build a tolerance doesn&#39;t mean it doesn&#39;t work. You are mistaking working less effectively for not working at all.</p>

<p>Opioids are synthetic drugs. Nerve blocks are perhaps even more transient than opioids.</p>

<p>It has serious abuse potential, but that doesn&#39;t mean the risks outweigh the benefits. Docs are changing prescription patterns due to the epidemic we have in this country. It may not be rapid and it may not be everywhere, but it&#39;s happening.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I used to know this better... opioids are great for pain relief, especially acute pain. But not only do you build up a tolerance, after awhile it increases pain. It has to do with the pain receptors. So the patient thinks they need more . But more will increase pain. This leads to the ER visits with the pain in agony. It is really sad to watch a person suffer with pain, and addiction too. I am not a doctor, I personally know a few pain doctors. You are right the industry is changing. One person I spoke with saw marked recovery in patients who added physical therapy. Only about half the patients in the practice agreeed to try it. Most people want a quick fix. My opinion we all have to take personal responsibility for our health, Blind trust in health care can literally be deadly.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think this is like 50% of the problem, the other half being the way the LGBT community treats itself. I&#39;m bi, have been for as long as I can remember, but have never fit in well with the larger LGBT community of today. They constantly promote open-mindedness and inclusivity, but often don&#39;t see that they are actually pushing an anti cis straight mindset. Consider when OP says:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Everyone who feels confused is transgender. If you make a single post on a transgender forum saying you think you might be trans, you will be validated in those feelings. No matter what the story, whether it&#39;s about enjoying &quot;female&quot; intrests, or something that sounds more like a sexual fetish than a legit medical condition, you are trans according to the user&#39;s.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For a lot of these people it is not enough to be accepting and helpful, they feel the need to force something on the confused. It&#39;s the same problem when religious people tell someone confused about their orientation that no matter what they are straight. Well, guess what, people can be confused but still be straight or gay, cis or trans, whatever.</p>

<p>The LGBT community, in its modern form, is just as destructive as those it used to fight against. Idk if this is the product of infiltration from intelligence agencies or just a weird byproduct of the SJW&#39;s etc. but I don&#39;t particularly like it.</p>

College tuition began to skyrocket when society deemed everyone should go to college (which is ridiculous unless you&#39;re studying to be a doctor, lawyer, engineer, etc.) and then became even worse when the government took over the student loan business because they&#39;ll approve anyone who applies regardless of the area of study or likelihood you can actually pay it back once you graduate and secure employment in that field. Insurance premiums and deductibles skyrocketed with the ACA.  (Health care is different than health insurance -- we should be asking why health care is so expensive!) I totally agree about Comcast and monopolies in general. There are laws against monopolies however lobbyists do their thing and then corrupt politicians approve the mergers anyway. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If OP&#39;s theory was true, that would be <em>nothing</em> compared to the long list of shit the pharmaceutical corporations have been caught doing red-handed. </p>

<p>Some doctors pretend to diagnose people, including children, and prescribe unnecessary psychiatric medications in exchange for bribes. </p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/jul/03/glaxosmithkline-fined-bribing-doctors-pharmaceuticals">The pharmaceutical group GlaxoSmithKline has been fined $3bn after admitting to bribing doctors and encouraging the prescription of unsuitable antidepressants to children. </a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/17/us/among-experts-scrutiny-of-attention-disorder-diagnoses-in-2-and-3-year-olds.html?_r=3">More than 10,000 American toddlers 2 or 3 years old are being medicated for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder outside established pediatric guidelines.</a></p></li>
</ul>

<p>This also goes for pain medication. </p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://fortune.com/2016/12/08/insys-execs-charged-bribing-doctors-fentanyl/">FBI agents arrested former Insys Therapeutics CEO Michael Babich and five other former company executives on Thursday for allegedly bribing doctors to prescribe fentanyl to patients who didn’t need it.</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/10/business/11drug-web.html">In Guilty Plea, Purdue Pharma to Pay $600 Million. The company that makes the narcotic painkiller OxyContin and three current and former executives pleaded guilty in federal court to criminal charges that they misled regulators, doctors and patients about the drug’s risk of addiction and its potential to be abused.  Company sales officials were allowed to draw their own fake scientific charts which showed a lower addictive potential, which they then distributed to doctors.</a></p></li>
</ul>

<p>The world of medicine is full of dark, deranged psychopaths who takes bribes in exchange for pushing unnecessary psychiatric medication on toddlers. Why would anyone be surprised if they were going after confused 17 year olds? </p>

<ul>
<li><p>In 2009, Dr. Marcia Angell of the New England Journal of Medicine wrote: <a href="http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2009/jan/15/drug-companies-doctorsa-story-of-corruption/">“It is simply no longer possible to believe much of the clinical research that is published, or to rely on the judgment of trusted physicians or authoritative medical guidelines. I take no pleasure in this conclusion, which I reached slowly and reluctantly over my two decades as an editor of The New England Journal of Medicine.”</a></p></li>

<p>Just because something is abnormal doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s wrong. You being so dismissive (I&#39;ve seen you post this link multiple times here already, usually with an extremely dismissive comment) is holding back the study of the transgender epidemic.

<p>There is a comment below that taps into an actual conspiracy (chemicals making men less manly)that could be upstream to your situation though. </p>

<p>Ladyboys have been around for ages though... so, I&#39;m not sure I buy any nefarious conspiracy on it (even that theory isn&#39;t nefarious just happenstance and then covered up.)

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with your point, but I think this fits into the whole sick-care rather than health-care industry. I don&#39;t think you have much to say that trans people are the only ones being singled out. The incentive is to get everyone addicted to something they are selling. long term patients generate more revenue than one time patients.</p>

<p>So attach this to autism, depression and drug abuse, then you can see that ypou&#39;re just another checkbox on the same form that fits you into their system.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>One thing to note, these people on the forums who seemingly want you to come out as being a transgender probably want to normalize themselves.  </p>

<p>Lets be honest.  They&#39;re weird.  They&#39;re different.  They&#39;re outcasts.  Not that there&#39;s anything wrong with these things, but it is what it is.   They want to see more people who are trans so they feel more normal.  They want to see other weird stuff so they feel normal.</p>

<p>There is nothing wrong with a dude that likes feminine things.  I have some girly interests and I&#39;m a dude and never questioned it.</p>

<p>I have some issues with the lgbtqxyz community as a whole for a number of reasons, this being one of them.  I don&#39;t have a problem with these groups of people for the most.  But I do have a problem with encouraging young, hormone crazed people to make such a huge impact on their development, mentally and physically.</p>

<p>Hormone therapy and surgery should be the last options since they&#39;re so life changing.  Sucking it up for a while, patience, and then therapy with professionals should be the first options.  I feel bad for the few people who have to go through this, but I don&#39;t think they should encourage others to join them unless its absolutely necessary, and to determine that, you need time and other alternatives first.</p>

<p>Sorry for the aside.  I was triggered.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey OP-</p>

<p>Thanks for this post. I, myself, have felt the way you do/did, although I never went as far as attempting to transition (too many factors in my life that prevented it i.e. kids, etc). I resonate with your story, and agree with you. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve been in and out of psychiatry and counseling for almost 20 years, and have legitimate mental illness issues that require medication (although recently I&#39;ve been trying to manage without it in an effort to get away from &quot;big pharm&quot;). I&#39;ve struggled with &quot;gender dysphoria&quot; for almost my whole life for the same reasons you&#39;ve described, and once I started trying to ask questions in forums, I received the same responses you described. Through more study into these issues, and the trans community in general, I can conclude that there is definitely a conspiracy here. There is a definite &quot;cult-like&quot; vibe in the community, and it&#39;s highly disconcerting, at the very least. Luckily I&#39;ve had a great support structure between my wife, dad, and little brother (all my best friends) to help me work through these things and find a sense of balance in my spirit. </p>

<p>On the autism link you mentioned, I could see that. I&#39;ve been tested (informally...saving money to get formally tested rn) and I&#39;m on the spectrum (closer to Asperberger&#39;s); others I&#39;ve talked to in the same area definitely have a connection between their Autism Spectrum diagnosis and supposed &quot;gender dysphoria&quot; issues. I think that&#39;s a worthwhile connection to look into. </p>

<p>All in all, thanks for sharing. As someone who&#39;s still struggling with finding and maintaining that balance, your post here was encouraging. </p>

<p>There&#39;s definitely a link between autism and transgerderism. I&#39;ve also never been formally diagnosed with autism, but mu therapist did tell me she thinks I&#39;m farther up on the spectrum than most of the population.</p>

<p>An ways, good luck in life man. Its great to hear you have a support system in place,that&#39;s huge when fighting something like this. I thinking making good friends that I can trust and talking this out with them was a big part of of me getting out of the trans cult.</p>

<p>I must say, I am in a better place now. When I was going through these feelings, I had no support structure (I had no friends, and parents who were too busy to pay attention to me) bit over the past year,  I&#39;ve made some close friends who helped me through this, and I have a girlfriend who is very supportive if me. I think social isolation is a serious problem in society that leads to people getting caught up in stuffike that, but I think that now that I have friends and get out more, my mental health has improved tremendously.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You just confirmed something I&#39;ve always had a suspicion about. You said your parents were too busy to pay attention to you. I have always thought that is people were more &quot;secure inside&quot; that they wouldn&#39;t be confused. And how do we become secure inside? I believe it is the job of the parents to instill this security by always being there for their children, and loving them unconditionally.</p>

<p>I have two teenage boys. They KNOW they are loved. They KNOW they can always depend on me. They KNOW I will always be there for them, no matter what.</p>

<p>And guess what? They are very secure inside. Neither of my boys are into sports and they are not tough guys. But they have always been secure and comfortable with who they are.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sorry that your parents were not there for you. I&#39;m a Mom and a good listener. You can always PM me, if you need someone that cares!  :-)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>its the porn.. people don&#39;t want to hear it but its the truth.</p>

<p>never before has a generation (i mean 30s and younger) had access to so much instant porn from a very young age, kids as young as 8 and even 6 have already watched lots hardcore porn without even understanding what they are watching.</p>

<p>remember, this is the first generation, there are very FEW studies of long term affects of porn on children.</p>

<p>i know this is hard to hear, because every young male likes porn, but its an addiction, with severe consequences. im not advocating nofap or anything like that, just that maybe just MAYBE watching countless clips of porn throughout the years might actually affect you negatively in some way. it starts as normal but then as you find out new fetishes it just moves to more shocking and shocking types of porn, looking for that porn &quot;high&quot;.</p>

<p>please guys, check youtube for &quot;porn addiction&quot; there&#39;s countless testimonials of people that became so addicted they even got to the point they couldn&#39;t get sexual arousal with a real person instead of porn, and how they started feeling transgenderism feelings because of porn.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are making a <em>lot</em> of assumptions here and none of it is &quot;the truth.&quot;</p>

<p>It&#39;s the truth - assumption</p>

<p>Kids as young as 8 and 6 have already watched lots of hardcore porn - assumption</p>

<p>Every young male likes porn - assumption</p>

<p>It&#39;s an addiction - it&#39;s not. It <em>can</em> be an addiction, just like alcohol <em>can</em> be an addiction or too much ice cream <em>can</em> be an addiction.</p>

<p>It starts as normal and then you find new fetishes for that porn high - assumption</p>

<p>All you have done is listed a bunch of possibilities depending on the circumstances; no truth whatsoever. I have watched a lot of porn in my life and I have <em>zero</em> problem fucking my fiancé and I have a hard time looking at random hot women and <em>not</em> wanting to fuck them.

<p>Porn addiction is a thing, but it is certainly no cover-all truth that applies to an entire generation. Don&#39;t be silly.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m 24, MtF trans, have been on HRT for a year and a half. My brain works better on estrogen than it ever has, and I&#39;m a far better person now. I&#39;m on this sub everyday, and some of these comments make my heart sink.
Trangender/gendernonconforming people have always existed for as far back as we know, some amount of the human population has a female brain and a male body (or vise versa). It <em>happens</em>, and those people can escape a terrible life of dysphoria and live happily as their self identified gender if they&#39;re caught early enough. In my experience in trans communities you know very fast when transitioning is right for you or not, it&#39;s just estrogen and an androgen blocker you&#39;re taking-- half the world runs on estrogen already. If it&#39;s not for you after a few months fine, no known permanent effect, but it&#39;s a life saver to others.</p>

<p>Hormones work better the younger you are. And many very trans people have a lot of hurdles between them and their treatment, this causes already transitioned people to project their regrets onto the younger generation, pressuring them to get hormones sooner.</p>

<p>I agree that it&#39;s scary how many people are pressured into transitioning when very fem males and very masc females exist, the transgender movement has a scary way of erasing these groups. I imagine a future where you more easily choose/experiment with your sex hormone for what&#39;s best for you. But I&#39;m biased because estrogen tremendously improved my life. And I think a whole lot of what holds transgender people back are the sexist and homophobic who feel your genetalia defines how you should think-- that is not authenticity.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m curious about your statement &quot;some amount of the human population has a female brain and a male body&quot;. But surely these people still have a HPT feedback system in their brains to regulate the testosterone equilibrium that their genetic predisposition dictates? </p>

<p>Is the goal to force the body into maintaining serum levels of estrogen/testosterone found in the average female by perpetually introducing exogenous hormones? Doesn&#39;t the brain constantly fight this by releasing LH and FSH? </p>

<p>I may be looking at this wrong, perhaps you don&#39;t literally mean that there is the equivalent of a female brain transplant in some individuals who were born as male. Maybe you mean it more as a spiritual/supernatural kind of thing? (Not my thing, but everyone has a right to their opinion) </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting thoughts. I can&#39;t imagine a literal transplant. I am phenotypically male (pre HRT), The Y chromosome must alter brain structure to some non-zero extent. I imagine our brains are pushed to be our biological gender, but sometimes in the absurdity that is creation of consciousness the &quot;incorrect&quot; gender is coded. I haven&#39;t thought about it before, but for my brain to &quot;force female hormones&quot; would be futile and self destructive to life&#39;s end goal of reproduction. Pre-HRT i was perfectly capable of having children. Either gender exists elsewhere in the brain than hormones regulating centers, or evolution has adjusted for these cases. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, trust me I am in no way opposed to hormonal manipulation in order to achieve goals. I just think that it is important to figure out where the &quot;starting point&quot; is per se. If we could define something as such then it might make it easier for a therapist to say &quot;you just need a good friend and counselor&quot; to some people and &quot;you need a serious change in physiology to feel normal&quot; to others. It may seem subjective, but everything does before it is explained well. What if it were possible to pinpoint a set of genetic or epigenetic traits or states that correlated with positive outcomes in gender transformations. That would make &quot;I&#39;m an X brain trapped in a Y body&quot; an identifiable and treatable condition. It would clear up the whole thing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree. My biochem background only gets me so far here, and we&#39;re delving into neuroscience. How could you quantify brain receptiveness to sex hormones? Maybe my tissues have different receptors than a cis-male? We have a long way to go from brain-scans to understanding these kinds of things (afaik), maybe with enough raw data it could be ballparked. 
There are a lot of variables. My brain is working subjectivity &quot;better&quot;, but I&#39;m also experiencing mental changes -- it&#39;s a second puberty. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s what I&#39;m talking about! We could easily assess the binding sites for sex hormones using immunofluorescent binding assays. Who knows, we might find something interesting. But the kicker is that you would need to assess people before and after a transformation. First with a binding assay and second with a quantitative measure of the outcome. Unfortunately I don&#39;t see a grant coming out of this :/ </p>

<p>Also, hormones are amazing in their capacity to alter genetic expression. So you would really have to control for people who have already taken hormones. They are so powerful that they can change the nature of their own binding. I know that a single administration of exogenous testosterone can actually increase androgen receptor sites (there is a study, but I&#39;m lazy).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well the reality is that this is a multifaceted issue and often unpacking these things can be difficult. However for those of us who are &quot;initiated&quot; and have read up on these things the connections start to become obvious. </p>

<p>In particular the rise of the radical left (read marxists) within the education system has been happening virtually unimpeded for close to 50 years. The evidence is obvious to those who are willing to look past the indoctrination and explore these topics with an open mind. </p>

<p>However recently the radical left has started to shift the narrative where now the mere discussion of these issues is being branded as &quot;wrong think&quot; and people like Dr. Jordan Peterson are now being branded as transphobic, homophobic or simply the catch all bigot. </p>

<p>The drive now is being focused entirely on shutting down all discussion around these topics much as the OP has described on the trans boards he was surfing. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for bringing this up. I completely agree. I stumbled across a website a long time ago of transgender regret stories, and it was horrifying. People who had spent so much money and time transitioning because they thought this is what they needed, only to really realize one day that all they needed was someone to sit down and tell them, no, you don&#39;t need to become a female/male. you need therapy.
 but no one ever did that for them, because like you said- anyone that &#39;questions&#39; your transgenderism is evil and not to be listened to. 
I don&#39;t know if Big Pharma is behind it all, I think the movement started on its own then snowballed because - internet, then snowballed because -everyone has to be special and unique!- then snowballed because let&#39;s treat transgenders like heroes and put them on TV and make &#39;brave&#39; documentaries about them- etc. But I&#39;m guessing Big Pharma is keeping transgenders in our faces as much as they can now. I&#39;m sure they pulled a lot of stuff behind the scenes... like getting &#39;transgender bathroom policies&#39; little political things like that. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>thanks for the insight OP, very informative and a great view into a complex topic. I truly believe your theory has some merit. Confusion in adolescences is quite a trying time for an individual; but for the solution to any confusion and awkwardness is that your are trans is way off mark. People need to grow and find themselves. Pushing and prescribing life long expensive hormone treatments... there is so much incentive (profit) for big pharma to not participate, much the same way they pushed perspiration pain meds. Hmm, can you take hormone treatments and be hooked on pain meds? Seems like you are big pharmas dream victim, er i mean patient. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve chosen to support them because they&#39;re family and I want them to be happy, but I can&#39;t help but notice and be confused by certain things.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Wearing a long dress in the middle of summer.  Last time we hung out, she was burning up.  She is very large, and needs long clothes to feel fem.  Any regular girl that day was wearing short shorts, skirt etc.  It was over 100.</p></li>
<li><p>Making sure everyone knows she is a she know.  Cute facebook pictures, license plate that says &quot;cat lady 62&quot; or some shit, just making sure its really obvious to everyone that she needs to be referred to as she.</p></li>
<li><p>Getting upset at me when I refer to her as Andrew instead of Arianna when talking about our childhood.  You were Andrew to me for 25 years, who you choose to be now doesn&#39;t change the fact that I grew up with a brother named Andrew.</p></li>
<li><p>Using an over the top voice.  She has a deep, husky, manly voice.  The voice she uses is over compensating for that and sounds very forced and unnatural.</p></li>
<li><p>Always talking about getting her nails done, going bra shopping, etc.  Making a point to let everyone know how girly her hobbies are.  Its weird, I&#39;ve never seen a girl make a big deal about doing these things.  Shit I&#39;ve even helped a few of my female friends paint their nails and it wasn&#39;t as big of a deal.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Before this I was neutral on the trans issue.  Didn&#39;t affect me, didn&#39;t care, if that&#39;s what makes you happy then go for it was my attitude.</p>

<p>After this I don&#39;t know.  She makes it feel so forced and awkward that is giving me a negative imoression.  Society tells me I&#39;m wrong and bigoted to feel that way but I don&#39;t know.  I feel weird letting me kids hang out with her.  I don&#39;t really want to have that talk with a 5 year old you know?  I don&#39;t want them growing up thinking that&#39;s normal, because in my heart I don&#39;t think it is.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know that I&#39;d go so far to say they&#39;re mentally ill but I agree with you here.  My brother / sister will never be a true woman in my eyes.  They grew up as a bigger than average male that intimidated his peers.  His first 25 years in life did not reflect what a woman goes through when they transition from a kid to a teen to adulthood.  Its more than genitals and breast size.</p>

<p>Up until the recent past, transgenderism was diagnosed with a mental illness called gender dysphoria. It is a little similar to body dysphoria and explains the high suicide rate in the transgender community.</p>

<p>Enabling people who are mentally ill is not doing them a service. These people deserve proper treatment but corrupt doctors are exploiting them and the media is encouraging society to enable them.</p>

When people do not focus on self-improvement, they lose attention of others - so they investigate cheat codes.</p>

<p>There are more cheats for women: Makeup, breast implants, botox, bum implants, tummy tucks, hair coloring, etc, etc.</p>

<p>For men, there are cheats:  Stealing, drugs, steroids, being a clown, etc.</p>

<p>Attention also comes in going against the grain.  Changing race, gender, weight, any extreme you can think of.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m certainly not trying to invalidate your experience, but as a trans woman myself and someone who has been through the full process of transitioning from male to female this has NOT been my experience!  I actually call BS on your post.  </p>

<p>Every single medical professional I have seen since starting my transition at 19 years old has been just that...professional!  There was never anyone pushing me from a medical or pharmaceutical stand point, my family were supportive and took everything in strides along side me, my psychiatrist warned me of all the potential risks of a social and medical transition.  I pursued a medical transition because it was right for ME!  Not one single person was pushing me into something I didn&#39;t want to do.  </p>

<p>That said, I firmly believe everyone has a different experience and that is totally okay.  I&#39;ve known others who initially thought they were trans, but ended up realizing they were just gay and/or effeminate.  I&#39;ve known trans men and women who identify as gay, straight, bi, etc., I&#39;ve known trans women who decide surgery is not right for them.  Again, it was the right choice for ME!  And I have no regrets and I&#39;m the happiest I have ever been in my life.  </p>

<p>If anyone wants to engage me in a healthy discussion on my experience, I welcome you to message me.  </p>

<p>I simply cannot get behind this idea that there is this alleged counter culture of people pushing for others to be trans because they&#39;re in some sort of vulnerable place in their lives?! </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Jeffreys identifies transsexualism with misogyny and describes it as a form of &quot;mutilation.&quot; She and her feminist allies encountered prolonged difficulties in securing a London speaking venue because of threats and agitation by transgender activists. Finally, Conway Hall was made available: Jeffrey&#39;s forceful, detailed lecture there in July of last year is fully available on YouTube. In it she argues among other things, that the pharmaceutical industry, having lost income when routine estrogen therapy for menopausal women was abandoned because of its health risks, has been promoting the relatively new idea of transgenderism in order to create a permanent class of customers who will need to take prescribed hormones for life.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think transgenderism, away from maleness, is a natural evolution of humanity. It&#39;s a movement alongside feminism and transhumanism. We don&#39;t really need male humans, and if you aren&#39;t capable of being a strong alpha type then there will naturally be a lot of pressure on you to switch. From individual perspectives it&#39;ll be freaky and painful, although perhaps no worse than during any other human epoch.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your theory is spot on. There is no such thing as medical genfer dysmorphia. Johns Hopkins University did a study showing it to be a mental illness, which when treated with good psychotherapy, will alleviate the mental confusion. </p>

<p>Not all boys will be like Hulk Hogan, and not all girls will be Miss America. But their gender personas and sexual genders are what they are born as. Rare cases exist, but not like the trans movement is displaying</p>

<p>Trans still need to be loved and cared for, but the approach of pharma treatment is an erroneous method of treatment; treatment needs to be through hypnotherapy and psychotherapy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think you should be taking hormones to change who you are. Jordan Patterson would say that life always has difficult times. There are two ways to deal with you problem 1. Live in a safe box where you ignore what troubles you or 2. You face your troubles straight on.</p>

<p>The first one is unsustainable because the longer you are in the safe box the more and more you have to ignore to remain there. Until you are so dissoluted you lose all sense of what is real anymore. Only by facing your fears straight on can you over come the hell you are going through.</p>

<p>The longer you go down this road pretending you are something different than what you are, the more negatively reinforces your argue will become. You have to realise that the only person oppressing you is yourself by running away from reality and living in the safe box. No amount of purple hair dye and lipstick is going to make you feel better because deep down in you self-conscious your mind knows what you are running from.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ehh no. The thing is that trans people do face a ton of bullshit from disbelieving family members and practitioners, getting treatment, keeping jobs/employment, so when someone says they&#39;re having x problem, they&#39;ll be believed and championed in these spaces because the OP is talking to people who dealt with worse. Included in this are people who were actually confused or in denial for several years or decades. It is considered bannable faux pas to be antagonistic toward people posting those kind of things, or antagonistic at all, because those groups and forums want to nurture a place where people can talk without being harassed. It does go too far some times. For example, I was banned fromr/ftm for pointing out that someone who was able to complete all of their medical care by 19 was lucky, because they are. It&#39;s not some George Soros funded shill experiment, it&#39;s touchy people who&#39;ve been through a lot of shit and have to redirect that hurt somewhere.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for this post, it is very interesting.</p>

<p>My belief is that transgenderism correlates with mental illness. If you believe and tell yourself that you were born the wrong sex, that is not normal, I&#39;m sorry. If people truly want to mutilate their genitals, Godspeed. What truly is bothersome is the amount of propaganda being shoved down our throats. The LGBTQ community are humans wanting to live their peaceful lives just like everyone else, but there has been a push by msm (that does not speak on behalf of lgbtq) to normalize and attribute this mindset to a lot of people. </p>

<p>I am in no way attacking anyone or intend to, but we got to see this for what it is. My beliefs do not stand in the way of my humanity. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I work at a mental health facility for teenagers, and this is pretty common. A lot of times the treatment or evaluation for gender Dysphoric, or questioning people is just to separate them from that community. It almost always works.</p>

<p>What baffles me is that transgenders make up less than like .01% of the population but they are portrayed to be much more plentiful. I&#39;ve never understood that part.</p>

<p>That&#39;s what makes all of this very questionable. Why is such a tiny, insignificant section of the population having such a huge impact? This is why a lot of people think there is a hidden agenda and they&#39;re trying to find out what it is.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll just say this tangent. After being on social media talking to primarily millennials, I&#39;ve found that this generation has been led to believe that they must fall into some category, some label, some group, etc. They&#39;re all about fitting in a certain category or spectrum. They have labels for everything defining themselves. I&#39;m asexual or I&#39;m an introvert or I&#39;m this or I&#39;m that. I&#39;m sorry but being 16 and feeling anti-social doesn&#39;t mean you&#39;re now defined as an introvert. Just means you&#39;re 16 and fucking normal. That and you will change allot throughout your life. I am no where near the same person I was 15 years ago. What you feel at certain times through out your life doesn&#39;t define you. Why can&#39;t you just be you and not have to group yourself in anything? You&#39;re feeling feminine tendencies and society tells you you must be trans, why can&#39;t they just be a man feeling feminine tendencies why must they be told where they fall on the spectrum and what&#39;s expected of them and who they should be? Why try to separate yourself even further from your neighbors. Stop trying to make yourself seem important, special, or different some how. We&#39;re all the same, just be yourself and stop worrying about what category you fit into. It only makes you believe bc of this one defining difference that you aren&#39;t the same as your neighbors and they/you couldn&#39;t possibly understand each other cuz he&#39;s that and I&#39;m this. Aside from all that if you feel that you really are a man trapped in a women&#39;s body and vice versa and medicine and surgery is what you feel is right for you then all the more power to ya do what makes you happy but you better make sure that&#39;s what you want bc you came to that conclusion yourself and you weren&#39;t influenced somehow by societal norms, social media, or pharma propaganda. Don&#39;t let anyone tell you who you are or who you must be. Just be you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree but I want to add that we also do this with the way we label all the things external to ourselves as well. &quot;Boy things&quot; &quot;girl things&quot; &quot;gay things&quot; on and on. I feel like so much of my childhood was defined by having to listen to all the things that I shouldn&#39;t want/have/say/do because I shouldn&#39;t want the label associated with them. &quot;You can&#39;t play drums, that&#39;s a boy instrument.&quot; &quot;Let your little brother play with your comic books. They&#39;re for boys anyway.&quot; &quot;Only dykes cut their hair like that.&quot; &quot;Don&#39;t be such a prude.&quot; &quot;Only sluts dress like that.&quot; As a kid you question more if wanting these things makes you the things they say you are. I wish we could just let people be people without deciding for them what it means. A whole world full of people who don&#39;t know who they are but can sure as hell tell <em>you</em> what you <em>shouldn&#39;t</em> be.  </p>

<p>I think one of my favorite examples of this is Eddie Izzard. He has a great quote about &quot;women&#39;s&quot; clothes here <a href="https://youtu.be/gHPh9j7lc58?t=140">https://youtu.be/gHPh9j7lc58?t=140</a>.  Eddie Izzard is &quot;labeled&quot; a transvestite. Why the fuck does it need a label? Dresses can be fucking comfortable. Pant&#39;s can be comfortable. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So I&#39;m actually trans myself and have been transitioned for about six years now. I understand exactly what you mean about the push to transition in the queer community, but I want to explain a few things based on my own experiences that may help you make sense of what&#39;s happening here. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Everyone who feels confused is transgender</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is because of two things. Like most LGBT issues, there is an actual understandable factor and a batshit crazy extremist factor that takes the understandable issues and takes them to ridiculous places. </p>

<p>The understandable factor is that most people are so deep in the closet that that they can&#39;t even see the light under the door. Transition is fucking terrifying and requires changing your entire life. Combine that with likely rejection from friends and family and it&#39;s easy to see WHY people remain closeted. When someone finally starts questioning consciously, they will often go through cycles of indulgence and purging (basically you buy a bunch of stuff to crossdress and explore your feelings, something happens or changes, then you get spooked or whatever and then throw it all out) and other trans people are trying to counter all the repression with validation. </p>

<p>However, the trans community and trans culture in general is fucking bonkers and more than a little cultish. They are overzealous and do way too much talking and no listening. Once you reach the level of &#39;fuck it&#39; required to go through with transition, you&#39;ve probably overly developed your selective listening skills by simple necessity and just disregard anything that doesn&#39;t fit your world view. I&#39;ll expand on this a lot more in a bit. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Any gender non conforming is proof of trans status</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Trans people are something like 0.1% of the total population. We are utterly insignificant as a demographic. The cause of this is very similar to the reasons I stated above. Basically, they get excited at more people joining the club. Combine that with the fact that most trans people, especially trans women, almost exclusively limit their close associates to other trans people and you can see why this happens. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>You are trans, and don&#39;t trust anyone who says otherwise</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, what begins reasonably is taken to crazy places. </p>

<p>Doctors used to be horrendous at trans people. Gender dysphoria is a real thing with probably biological causes (though admittedly medical evidence is currently too scant due to lack of comprehensive studies), but that doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s wrong to be skeptical. My doctor won&#39;t give me antibiotics just because I ask for them, and neither should they give you hormones just because. Evaluation needs to be done, but historically doctors just made us jump through hoops to fuck with us. Stuff like the &quot;real life experience,&quot; which usually involved spending a year living and dressing as your identified gender before prescribing hormones. This doesn&#39;t sound like a bad idea if you don&#39;t realize that nearly no one passes without HRT, and that just paints a target on your back. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Asking questions is evil and dangerous
You are trans and you are amazing</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is just narcissism run amok. It&#39;s bullshit, it pisses me off, and it&#39;s why I avoid trans communities. People typically age out of the trans community, which is very unlike the LGB parts, and I think it&#39;s partly because we just outgrow all of this. I don&#39;t really care that I&#39;m trans, it&#39;s not an important part of my identity. Some trans people ONLY care that you&#39;re trans, and I avoid them.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Big pharma conspiracy</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Admittedly, this is where you kinda lost me. I don&#39;t know how far you got in the process, but the drugs used for HRT have been generic for decades and are dirt cheap even in the US. Without insurance I&#39;d pay less than $100/mo. Now I absolutely believe big pharma pulls shady bullshit like this, but is it really worth it to do this for 0.1% of the population? How are they even breaking even on this? </p>

<p>The trick, of course, is to convince people who don&#39;t have gender dysphoria that they&#39;re trans. This sounds logical, but when cis men take estrogen, they DEVELOP gender dysphoria in the opposite direction. Look up any study relating to hormonal prostate cancer treatment. The side effects are item for item a description of the things trans women feel before transition.</p>

<p>So, I&#39;m being honest here. I see most of your logic, and agree with some of it, but do you honestly think big pharma would bother when there&#39;s real money to be made with more expensive drugs targeted to larger populations? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s two drugs and in higher doses than are typically prescribed for other applications. I take 4mg of estrogen and 150mg of spironolactone per day. Estrogen as given to menopausal cis women is typically half to a quarter of that dose. Spiro is actually primarily a blood pressure medication and comes in 25-50mg tablets.</p>

<p>Note also, there are no drugs in the market that are actually approved for the application trans people use the for; it&#39;s all off-label. Big pharma would make a shitload more cash if they just slightly altered these drugs, patented them again because they can do that, and got them approved for treatment of gender dysphoria. This would cost next to no investment as trans people have been using these drugs in this way for decades and effects and side effects are already well known. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Please do, let me know your thoughts on it as well.</p>

<p>This video sort-of goes in line with that seemingly ludicrous/joke claim of &#39;the government is turning the frogs gay,&#39; or something similar.</p>

<p>What most people don&#39;t realize is that there is actually a lot of evidence to back this up. High concentrations of certain plastic chemicals (acting as estrogens) are causing male animals to become hermaphroditic.</p>

<p>The symptoms are even being seen in humans at an astounding rate- boys born today are more likely to be infertile, and have more problems with their genitals becoming malformed or &#39;feminized&#39; than ever before in recently recorded human history.</p>

<p>Our modern way of life is changing male anatomy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Everyone who feels confused is transgender. If you make a single post on a transgender forum saying you think you might be trans, you will be validated in those feelings. No matter what the story, whether it&#39;s about enjoying &quot;female&quot; intrests, or something that sounds more like a sexual fetish than a legit medical condition, you are trans according to the user&#39;s.&quot;</p>

<p>That&#39;s just what people who live in echo chamber forums do. Go to any lgb forum and claim you might have same sex feelings or like a certain type of porn and you will get people making claims about your identity as well. There are reasonable people who will ask you further questions about how you feel and then tell you to COME TO THE CONCLUSION ON YOUR OWN. Only you know you best.</p>

<p>&quot;Any gender non-conforming is proof of trans status. Like certain movies, music or TV? You are trans. Like wearing bright colored clothes? You are trans. Have more female than male friends? You are trans.&quot; 
By who&#39;s standard? Random people on internet forums? This is why the decision about your identity shouldn&#39;t be put in other people&#39;s hands as I stated previously. No one can tell you who you are no matter how much you think they can. </p>

<p>&quot;&quot;You are trans, and don&#39;t trust anyone who says otherwise. The most common complaint on these websites is that doctors are &quot;gatekeeping&quot; them. Anyone who doubts you in your feelings is evil, and you should lie and cheat your way into getting the treatment you &quot;need&quot;.&quot;</p>

<p>If you have already established you are trans ON YOUR OWN, then you should know that doctors do infact gatekeep. There is still a stigma surrounding transition and doctors are reluctant about pretty much everything because many know little about trans healthcare. This is just a fact of the matter. </p>

<p>&quot;Asking questions is evil and dangerous. Trans people commit suicide all the time, and asking any questions about trans ideology just makes the problem worse. Accept what we say, or gtfo&quot;</p>

<p>In trans echochamber communities, they often consider it to be a safe space so people asking questions about suicide can be triggering to them. Trans people tend to be an emotionally vulnerable group. If want to ask me about trans perspective, then I invite you to do that. I enjoy educating in these topics.</p>

<p>&quot;
If you are trans, you are amazing. Trans people love boosting their own and each other&#39;s ego&#39;s. When you are a depressed teenager who doesn&#39;t fit in, this can be huge.&quot;
Yes, you can say this about any specific community however. Gay people, body builders, conspirators, feminists, etc. You will see lots of positivity and congratulations in those communities for simply being accepting and part of them. Most social media has like buttons, Reddit is no exception. These things boost ego when you get lots.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not going to touch the conspericy aspect much besides saythig that the only conspericy I see in regard to big pharma and trans people is that doctors will push hormone therapy onto trans people (usually non binary trans people like myself) and we end up realizing we are non binary and medically &quot;detransition&quot; because the HRT does not help with the dysphoria, just changes it to a different part of the body. Non binary trans people are also often pressured by the binary trans community to transition medically. Which, not cool man.</p>

<p>Another conspericy I believe is actually there is the medical system pressuring trans people into GRS or &quot;the surgery&quot;. This is where BIG MONEY is made. Society tells trans people that they aren&#39;t &quot;real x&quot; until they get some kind of surgery. Trans person consults with the doctor and the doctor reinforces society and makes the trans person feel like this surgery will change their life and they will have &quot;completed&quot; transition with it.</p>

<p>Trans person gets surgery and thinks their life will completely change. Trans person realizes after the surgery that actually no, people will still discriminate against you forever and always over your assigned gender at birth and the trans person is devastated and kills themself believing nothing would have ever been good enough. </p>

<p>Then society just looks at the statistical data about suicide after GRS and makes the false correlation of &quot; they killed themself because transition is bad!&quot; Which completely ignored the trans persons actual experiance in what happened and was ironically the complete opposite reasoning. </p>

<p>But the medical system doesn&#39;t give a shit that they built this trans persons ego up so high only for them to come crashing down after surgery because the medical system already have their pockets filled and surgery is often a one time deal, so no one stops and says to the trans person that &quot; ACTUALLY NO, THIS SURGERY WILL NOT MAKE YOU CISGENDER IN THE EYES OF SOCIETY, YOU WILL STILL FACE DISCRIMINATION&quot; because no one wants to lose money by making a trans person reconsider </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve read up on a separate theory that I believe about transgenderism. It&#39;s s just a plot by the NWO for population control. Right now they&#39;re having trouble controlling us so they need to make sure we don&#39;t keep reproducing at high rates so the population evens out to a &quot;sweetspot&quot; where there are enough of us to be productive and make them money but not too many to keep track of. </p>

<p>They do it by destroying the nuclear family. Pushing things like transgenderism and gay rights down our throats in a way that makes people who aren&#39;t even questioning think twice about how they really feel about themselves. Normalizing divorce or it even marrying at all, etc.</p>

<p>Think about how many years now you&#39;ve constantly heard that divorces are at an all time high, ___ amount of marriages end in divorce, it&#39;s all a sham to discourage people from getting married and starting a family. Brainwashing people into believing that they are something they&#39;re not is another one of their tactics.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve also come across supporting conspiracy theories that fit the same theme stating that there are chemicals in our food and water supply that feminize men at a rate we&#39;ve never seen before. That&#39;s why your grandpa is a &quot;real man&quot; your dad is a &quot;man&quot; and you aren&#39;t by their standards. It&#39;s because they weren&#39;t as exposed to as many of these chemicals at a young developing age like millennials. </p>

<p>The deeper you into the rabbit whole the more evidence and separate theories you find to support that it&#39;s all just a population control scheme. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re not alone. Growing up, I definitely wasn&#39;t typical. I had a lot of feminine mannerisms due to being the only male in the home and liked ballet and gymnastics. Although I had girlfriends, I wasn&#39;t much interested in sex and got a lot of &#39;&#39;You&#39;re gay and just don&#39;t know it&#39;&#39;. In my late teens, I was very androgynous and dressed accordingly and many would refer to me as though I was a girl. As I aged, I became more certain of who I am. I&#39;m not gay nor Transgender.</p>

<p>It&#39;s alright to be a male that likes things not typically associated with males. Hobbies and aesthetics have little to do with sexuality or gender. It&#39;s ironic that those pushing the non-binery agenda are the same pushing people to conform their sexuality and fender to their preferences. And you are correct; big pharma has a lot to gain from a lifetime of dependency. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re right that hormone replacement is a cash cow, and all involved parties are in on it to some degree. People do all manner of shady things on the internet. So sure, pharma shills are absolutely a thing.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s the catch though. This is just your experience. Lots of people who&#39;ve transitioned are happier than they&#39;ve ever been. That&#39;s what coming out does. That&#39;s worth the money to them, even if it&#39;s hard.</p>

<p>I think the bulk of the problem the trans community faces on a personal level comes from miscalculating the financial burden. It sucks, but to do it right you have to be pretty rich. It&#39;s like any other large investment. High risk, high reward.</p>

<p>Some perspective. Far more teens are brainwashed into dying or being permanently disabled for their government. For those that appear healthy, veteran suicide is insanely high. Or teens are brainwashed it to participating in mass dehumanization disguised as law enforcement.</p>

<p>At least trans people die, get mangled and suicide over something unarguably real for themselves. Instead of an empty cause like wars on &quot;terror,&quot; or &quot;crime.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I feel like this is less of a conspiracy and more of a start to an industry emerging around a generally new psychological/emotional concept.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I think I may have nearly been taken advantage of by nefarious actions from the pharmaceutical  industry</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This shouldn&#39;t come as a surprise. I mean, it&#39;s the pharmaceutical industry. They try to make money off everyone for everything. As I pointed out, this is still a new social concept and so any therapy or medication is going to be less standardized and more expensive, especially since I&#39;m sure most insurance companies consider these procedures voluntary/unnecessary  (I don&#39;t feel this way, but it&#39;s not hard to imagine they do).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I found something that made my life make sense: transgender forums. These websites told me that my feelings were classic transgender feelings... I needed treatment immediately... I began the process of changing my gender... Then I got a wakeup call. There were loads of guys like me, who may not act like the &quot;manly man&quot; ideal, but still have no intention to change there gender.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I gotta be honest here, and I really don&#39;t want to offend you, but what it seems like is you were at a vulnerable stage and we&#39;re grasping at something you felt made you feel special/part of a community. Nobody really made you believe what you did. You were just uncomfortable in high school and that&#39;s an almost universal feeling. People are still developing their personality and body at that point, it&#39;s pretty much a given.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The following is common retoric from support groups, forums and therapists.</p>

<p><strong>Everyone who feels confused is transgender</strong>. If you make a single post on a transgender forum saying you think you might be trans, you will be validated in those feelings. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>This isn&#39;t surprising. The LGBTQ community is open and inviting and I doubt they&#39;d tell you what you&#39;re feeling is wrong. That&#39;s what the forum is all about: questioning gender and feeling like you&#39;re not alone. </p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Any gender non-conforming is proof of trans status</strong>. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>As stated above, the chances of them trying to disuad you from being who you think you are is almost nonexistent. </p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>You are trans, and don&#39;t trust anyone who says otherwise</strong>. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Cmon, it&#39;s the LGBTQ community. They have very VERY strong feelings against sexual and gender persecution. Obviously they&#39;re going to equate anyone who says &quot;you can&#39;t be ______&quot; as a hateful douche. </p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Asking questions is evil and dangerous&quot;</strong>. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Despite being more open minded and accepting, the community will still be subject to the &quot;us vs them&quot; mentality. Criticism or questioning ideology will more often than not be met with some level of hostility. </p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>If you are trans, you are amazing</strong>. Trans people love boosting their own and each other&#39;s ego&#39;s. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, you said it pretty much how it is. This point relates directly to the other points. In a sense, they want you to agree with them. Besides trying to help you accept what you feel, it will also help them validate their own beliefs. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>When someone takes the hormones they need for &quot;treatment&quot;, they are prescribe to expensive medication for life, one that requires lots of medical attention. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, you are directly conflicting your own genetic make up. OF COURSE you&#39;re going to have a life long hormone regiment. And changing your body chemistry drastically could cause problems, so they&#39;ll probably want to monitor you for long and short term effects. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>These people are cash cows for the medical industry. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yeah, just like every other specific ailment. It&#39;s a new pharmacological practice, they&#39;re certainly not gonna make it cheap. </p>

<p>I have Crohns disease and the medications I&#39;m on are stupid expensive. Unlike gender/sexual reassignment, my disease is considered a life affecting ailment. If I didn&#39;t have decent insurance I&#39;d be spending thousands a month for what I need to take. </p>

<p>Insurance companies aren&#39;t going to pay out for something they don&#39;t deem necessary. This shouldn&#39;t surprise anyone. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Unfortunately, there are not a lot actual transgender people in the world today. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because it&#39;s new. Sure, people have probably always felt that way, but it&#39;s only now being focused on as an actual condition. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>So why not make more? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>.... because there&#39;s not a lot of openly  trans people, as you just said. Why would they focus their resources on a broad spectrum of treatment when theirs other ailments deemed more necessary to research? They&#39;re definitely not going to keep making medication that reduce cost of the therapy. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I think that big pharma is shilling forums and paying off doctors and therapists to convince people that they need these hormones.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There&#39;s really no avoiding this. Pharmaceutical companies and lobbyists will push their products to make money. Do doctors get bribed? Sure, but definitely not the majority of them. And therapists are meant to help you with your psychological problems. They can only work with way you give them so if you go in and say &quot;I am a man and feel like I should be a woman&quot; they&#39;re going to help you cope with that. Their goal isn&#39;t to tell you you are or arent, especially since geder/sexual orientation is something very delicate and not a &quot;you definitely are/arent&quot; subject. It&#39;s not cut and dry.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The average trans person fits a simple mold... that description probably describes a large portion of the population. That&#39;s where the medical company&#39;s take advantage of people... High school sucks.. but it gets better. University and the real world isn&#39;t high school... pharmaceutical companies are convincing people that the problem isn&#39;t that high school sucks and they need treatment now.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, they didn&#39;t seek you out and brain wash you. You visited a forum filled with members of a community that not only will try to help you cope with your feelings but WANT those feelings to be true. Are they wrong for doing so? No. You&#39;re your own person. In the end you believed it because you wanted to. Then you went to a therapist with the idea that you were trans and they worked with you to help you cope. Now, they might be a bit at fault because they should have told you that those are all normal feelings, but I doubt it was to intentially lure you into a pharmaceutical plot. Then you went to a doctor after deciding that you wanted to change your gender and the doctor was helping you to do so. Are you going to blame them for that? Because that&#39;s kind of their job. The pharmaceutical companies and insurance aredefinitely are to blame for the cost, but did you think it was going to be cheap/simple/quick to do? </p>

<p>You are the one who made those decisions. You found something that made you feel accepted and went with it. To say that big pharma is actually trying to convince people they&#39;re trans is a huge stretch. They&#39;re taking advantage of it, sure. But you are the one who decides what to do about all of it. In the end you realized what you felt is perfectly normal and became more comfortable with yourself. </p>

<p>Tl;Dr- no, not really </p>

<p>When someone takes the hormones they need for &quot;treatment&quot;, they are prescribe to expensive medication for life,</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Minor nitpick: these &quot;expensive medications for life&quot; consist of generic drugs that cost, without medical insurance in the US, between <a href="http://health.costhelper.com/hormone-replacement-therapy.html">$10 and $85 a month</a>. There&#39;s nothing magical or special about these drugs, since - like every other medical procedure used to assist transgender people, including surgical procedures - they were developed to treat conditions experienced by large numbers of non-transgender people and adapted for the very small population of transgender people. A trans woman will take the exact same estrogen supplements prescribed to a cis woman whose body doesn&#39;t make estrogen, say after a hysterectomy. A trans man will take the exact same testosterone treatments as a doctor would advise for a cis man whose testes weren&#39;t functional.<br/>
Since the drugs have been in production for a half century or more and are in such wide use there&#39;s very little markup, and thus very little profit to be made by pushing them on more patients.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>These people are cash cows for the medical industry.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Consider that there are only a handful of doctors in the US who treat trans patients - only about thirty who do &quot;the surgery&quot; (genital confirmation surgery, popularly known as &quot;sex change surgery&quot;) in the whole country of 340 <em>million</em> people. The number of such surgeons is growing at an astonishingly slow rate, as the specialty requires not only a rare set of surgical skills, but also the willingness to work with trans clients. If this were a planned &quot;cash cow&quot;, it doesn&#39;t look like there&#39;s much interest in actually cashing in on it.</p>

<p>Trans people also tend to be <em>freaking broke</em>. Their trans status makes it harder for them to find employment or housing, they&#39;re far from all being Caitlyn Jenners when it comes to their pocketbooks. Does it make any sense to target a community of people who tend to not have any money as your &quot;cash cows&quot;?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A lot like how in Canada you could (potentially) have your kids taken away for not conforming to the gender science they learned in school. The plan is ingenious: Send gullible kids to public schools, where they are taught about &quot;non-conventional gender.&quot; Then, the susceptible young student comes home and makes remarks about being a different gender (while still in the stage of life where they also want to grow up to be a horse). If you don&#39;t accept these fantasies or potentially even take chances to prevent them you might get your kids removed and take to &quot;pro LGBT&quot; households. Not to mention this will most likely target certain demographics and will rarely be used against religions like Islam.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think so man. 
I think it&#39;s because the trans community feels so outcasts that they are quick on trying to recruit others for their cause. So in the trans community you get alot of &quot;yes you&#39;re definitely trans&quot; reactions and a lot of huggy, hand holding acceptance along with it. </p>

<p>This is actually pretty prevalent if you browse any new (post 2010-ish) trans forums and it&#39;s really unfortunate for those who are like you and just don&#39;t fit into specific gender molds. </p>

<p>Now, since the trans community has reached spotlight, therapists and pharma&#39;s probably have teamed up for anyone going to talk it out with a gender therapist. </p>

<p>This is why research is important for therapists and anything of this nature. And most of all, for anyone reading this who might be &quot;confused&quot;-- trust your damn self! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is completely fucked and 100% plausible. I see such a push in the LGBT community to identify as trans. It&#39;s the &quot;in&quot; thing now and I think many &quot;trans&quot; people are just experiencing the normal confusion of puberty and adolescence. 
There is a desperate need to belong at that age and I think this is less a biological reality for most people and more that they are getting caught up in a movement, in being a part of something that feels positive and affirming. </p>

<p>Many trans kids are just confused because they are kids. But if you state this, you&#39;re a bigot who hates trans people. Of course there are some genuinely trans people and I don&#39;t mean to diminish their struggle. However I just don&#39;t think it&#39;s that prevalent.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, you are describing normal confusion during teenage adolescence. It is a period of time when people are extremely susceptible to influences from religions, cults, Scientology, multi-level-marketing scams, and whatever you want to call the GLBTQ+ culture. Does big pharma make money off this? Sure, but they are providing a service demanded by their customers. I think we would all be better served helping people learn to be comfortable in their own skins instead of validating their fears that something is &quot;wrong&quot; with them. If people still want to become GLBTQ+, bravo for them, but I bet we would have a lower suicide rate if we helped them realize they are normal and okay exactly as they were born first.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Excellent post, seems like a valid theory. Definitely wouldn&#39;t put it past big business to try some shady stuff like this. On a side note to OP, I have a close friend that recently made the switch and is now post-op, but I remember he had to go through therapy first and one of the first things they did was to run a hormone test. They discovered he was extremely low in testosterone. They suggested he take supplements to increase T levels and see if that changed his perspective. He declined as he was sure he was meant to be a girl, I mean everyone was reaffirming his choice at that point and he had already come out to his friends and family. I&#39;m sure by then he felt trapped into sticking with his decision. I don&#39;t hear this talked about much. I mean balancing hormones should be almost mandatory first before going through something as drastic as a sexchange. The rate of depression and suicide in that community is staggering, and a lot of the medication they put them on makes it worse! Seems like they are being set up for failure either way.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Bit of a tangent here in regards to the low testosterone bit. Testosterone Replacement Therapy is usually prescribed for men with low Test values, but as of late the health industry has been making this increasingly difficult to get. </p>

<p>The, already wide, range of what used to be 350-1200ng/dL has had its lower end decreased to 270ng/dL. </p>

<p>So now when men come to their doctor feeling unmotivated, lethargic, and depressed; all symptoms of low testosterone, instead of getting accurately diagnosed they get prescribed antidepressants or anti anxiety medication. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know if this is tied to the constant war on masculinity or plot to sell more drugs to make people more docile. Maybe this sounds crazy, but this has been on my mind.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll respectfully disagree here.</p>

<p>We can attach all kinds of causes for this problem - consumerism, culture of instant gratification, lack of actual tribulation in life.</p>

<p>However, going by what you conveyed here. You seem to be in a biological sense, born a male runt. Both physically and mentally.</p>

<p>Reading through your post, the moral of your story; from beginning to end you blame others or things supposedly not in your control. &quot;genetics&quot;, &quot;the others (don&#39;t like what I like - I must be a woman)&quot;, &quot;big pharma&quot;. </p>

<p>There is no conspiracy here; you are simply weak-willed, and weak-minded. Always looking for someone else to blame for your frustrations.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think that all of this is much easier to explain if you consider that often people who actually are affected by gender dysphoria go through. Most of them are/were dismissed as just going through &quot;a phase&quot; because, honestly, most people that claim to be transgender are going through a phase, like you did. So the ones who actually experience gender dysphoria, so the ones who end up actually changing gender, and hang out on the forums, feel like everyone, just like them, was being denied actual and important treatment, or being dismissed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I want everyone to be happy in their lives. I don&#39;t begrudge anyone wanting to change anything about themselves. But I do have some reservations. Not long ago, I read an interview of one of the first men to travel to Sweden for a sex change. He&#39;s quite old, and I&#39;m not sure he&#39;s still alive. He said he felt he had made a mistake going through with the operation. That what he actually  suffered from was something like body dysmorphia, but the doctors and therapists he met with felt he really wanted to be a woman, and steered him in that direction. </p>

<p>Another thing I worry about is the parents who might promote the transgender idea, whether consciously or unconsciously--because they want to show they&#39;re cool and accepting--like it strokes their own ego. Especially the ones who don&#39;t allow their child to enter puberty. How will they truly know who the are if they don&#39;t?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Pharma did the same with the opioid crisis by the way. They marketed OxyContin and claimed addiction is different than dependency. They paid doctors to prescribe it in the way of speakers fees. Doctors handed it out like candy, that was the beginning of our opioid crisis. It climaxed with prescription fentanyl using the same promotional tactics. Now some doctors are in jail and some executives have been arrested. 
I think what you describe is the same thing. Same business model, using trickery to identify &quot;appropriate patients&quot;. Doctors accept the marketing propaganda because they are also getting paid to prescribe, meanwhile many young impressionable teens lives are getting destroyed. It is criminal malpractice. Thank you for figuring this out. This is a big issue.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>For the past 4 years I&#39;ve been wondering and connecting the transgender movement to the rise of social media. It is a very appalling thing to study and ultimately try and comprehend. It seems the rise of the internet and phone tech suck as apps(grinder or tinder for example). I&#39;m it gives people(especially confused people) a safe zone where others can manipulate them to thinking they are not the true person they were born as. This isn&#39;t only apps like grinder either, it&#39;s been happening since the old school messenger sites. Only now have I really seen the push to feminize our youth, it&#39;s disgusting how they are doing it to. I with I had know sooner so my sister wouldn&#39;t have been exposed to such otracitites. Now she admires Kylie Jenner and Nikki Minaj, trying to get their Bodies while being so ignorant about their plastic surgery.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When money is available somebody will always stoop lower than you can imagine to get it. It&#39;s very easy for a person to rationalize damaging behavior, especially if it&#39;s levels below their direct involvement. E.g the marketing director knows that some hotshot young hire is &quot;engaging social media&quot; and that there is a budget and numbers to show return on investment. The hotshot young hire is throwing everything at the wall and running with whatever sticks. If that happens to be astroturfing on transgender forums then so be it. There is always somebody who wants a nicer car or a nicer house and is willing to do whatever it takes to get it. </p>

<p>When I was 17 I hadn&#39;t a clue about anything. I thought I did but I really didn&#39;t. I don&#39;t know if my experience was typical but I can&#39;t understand how so many people that age are able to make the decision to change gender. I&#39;m not saying nobody that age can make the decision. But I do think that changing gender is being pushed as a solution like you said. Or maybe not pushed so much as made to seem like a good solution for too broad a range of problems.</p>

<p>Being a teenager is especially awful if you have a disproportionate amount of self-awareness or intellect. And that&#39;s not uncommon. But it&#39;s ok. The world and the people on it are confusing and contradictory. They always were and they always will be. You cannot rationally analyze the irrational. It takes time and experience to become comfortable with that and you will be awkward until you become comfortable. So go have more experiences. </p>

<p>Everybody is experiencing the same world in different ways, drawing different conclusions and forming different internal paradigms and worldviews. Of course there is a lot of overlap between people but most people will not think or react in the same way as you. You have to be prepared to change how you think and react in order to understand other people. And that&#39;s literally what &quot;fitting-in&quot; is. You don&#39;t have to permanently change or give up or compromise anything, your core is your core. But you can change your interface moment by moment. It&#39;s not superficial or contrived, it&#39;s simply being social. </p>

<p>If I had known that when I was 17 my life would have gone waaaaay smoother.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I miss the old days! I&#39;m a 49 year old woman (born with a vagina). I knew a few &quot;Tom Boys&quot; (butchy girls) growing up. We just called them Tom Boys. They even called themselves Tom Boys. No big deal. NONE of them ever said they were really a boy trapped in a woman&#39;s body.</p>

<p>And yes, I knew a few feminine guys growing up. They were fine with the way they were.</p>

<p>When I was growing up, if someone said they were born in the wrong body then we knew they were mentally ill.</p>

<p>Funny wording, that.  I don&#39;t think they are faking it, I think they have a treatable mental illness that does not require surgery.</p>

<p>We don&#39;t treat depression by suiciding people, why treat gender dysmorphia by hacking off genitals?  Are you aware that the suicide rate among transgender people actually <em>rises</em> significantly after gender reassignment surgery?  How can you call that effective treatment?  Are you <em>trying</em> to kill transgender people?  Are you literally Hitler?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>People shouldn&#39;t be discriminated against because they are being who they are. I argue that drug is blocking their true self because discontinuing it rapidly brings back the wants, but I&#39;ve said that before. Maybe in the end, this whole thing is part of humanity&#39;s evolution and we can stop ostracizing and discriminating against each other for differences. But we haven&#39;t even stopped racism yet so who knows? But I definitely see your point, even though that ideology is what was tried for years before hormones and SRS became the accepted treatment. Maybe there is another treatment out there we&#39;ve yet to find that would work better, altering epigenetics but that little excerpt you showed me was not conclusive of a true treatment for everyone in any way, even if it&#39;s a start or idea towards one. Reducing dosage just brings back gender dysphoria at least in that specific case, it is in no way a real treatment or cure for the whole populous. One case study of a drug that has sexual side effects on prolactin.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Aside from the retarded notion that people should inherit the sins of their fathers, all of human history is filled with people conquering other people- it&#39;s not specific to Europeans. Do you think Mongols, Arabs, etc. should be displaced in their own homelands too, or just Europeans?</p>

<p>And another thing, native Americans and Australians resisted being conquered- because that&#39;s what you&#39;re supposed to do. As far as I know, no one in the history of humanity has ever laid down and allowed themselves to be conquered. That would be pathetic.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Except I gave backing to all on my claims in a comment already. Well done idiot...</p>

<p>Here&#39;s what I said in case you are to lazy to look:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.cumc.columbia.edu/publications/in-vivo/Vol2_Iss10_may26_03/">&quot;National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) added estrogen to its list of known cancer-causing agents.&quot;</a></p>

<p>The political is hard to prove because their aren&#39;t polls on that but we all know <a href="http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2016/07/transgender-woman-makes-history-democratic-national-convention/">democrats pander to the trans  community.</a></p>

<p>Trans are wimps, is pretty self-explanatory. A man wants to be a women...... don&#39;t know what else to say..</p>

<p>If gender doesn&#39;t matter does age. <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-3356084/I-ve-gone-child-Husband-father-seven-52-leaves-wife-kids-live-transgender-SIX-YEAR-OLD-girl-named-Stefonknee.html">I&#39;ve gone back to being a child&#39;: Husband and father-of-seven, 52, leaves his wife and kids to live as a transgender SIX-YEAR-OLD girl.</a></p>

<p>Trans is also known as gender dysphoria. 
<a href="https://www.psychiatry.org/patients-families/gender-dysphoria/what-is-gender-dysphoria">People with gender dysphoria may often experience significant distress and/or problems functioning.</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/19uwok/mtf_hormones_and_sterility/">Here</a> is a talk about how hormone replacement therapy causes infertility. I.E. trans can&#39;t have kids.</p>

<p>I hope I cleared all of that up for you now get out of the conspiracy sub or maybe just have a look around. Either way be open minded. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think you should be taking hormones to change who you are. Jordan Patterson would say that life always has difficult times. There are two ways to deal with you problem 1. Live in a safe box where you ignore what troubles you or 2. You face your troubles straight on.</p>

<p>The first one is unsustainable because the longer you are in the safe box the more and more you have to ignore to remain there. Until you are so dissoluted you lose all sense of what is real anymore. Only by facing your fears straight on can you over come the hell you are going through.</p>

<p>The longer you go down this road pretending you are something different than what you are, the more negatively reinforces your argue will become. You have to realise that the only person oppressing you is yourself by running away from reality and living in the safe box. No amount of purple hair dye and lipstick is going to make you feel better because deep down in you self-conscious your mind knows what you are running from.</p>
