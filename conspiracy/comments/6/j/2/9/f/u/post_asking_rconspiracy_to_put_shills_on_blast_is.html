<p>I&#39;m suggesting people look through the account activity of someone who is doing &quot;shill-esque&quot; things. Stifling discussion, pushing &quot;whataboutism&quot;, things of that sort.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Look dude, I didn&#39;t even read the thread. I just saw the title of the post and thought it was weird there was a post suggesting we break the rules was on the FP. I see now that you said screenshots in the title, but that didn&#39;t even register at the time. Which means that if this isn&#39;t what you meant in the post, then you worded the title in a way which could be misleading to people that don&#39;t click on it and actually read it. Therefore the people calling you out on it still have a point. </p>

<p>Looks to me like the reason your responses are getting to heavily downvoted isn&#39;t because of brigading, it&#39;s the way you&#39;re going about it. I&#39;d recommend trying to avoid going the angry route and insulting people, and stick to calm and concise rebuttals. You make good points, but no one will listen to you if you&#39;re a dick about it.</p>

<p>I know this post has been deleted, so I&#39;m just writing this for you really. If you don&#39;t agree with what I&#39;ve said, reply or PM me why. Trying to be an ally here, not an enemy.</p>

<p>The only time you should call a person a shill is when you cant attack their argument or cant defend your own.</p>

<p>If everyone kept to the topic this wouldnt be an issue, every statement needs to be investigated. Shill accusations are a way of getting the conversation away from the topic or conspiracy at hand and now it becomes about the shill or about the user. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here is the comment from the mod <a href="/u/mastigia">/u/mastigia</a> that said as long as we followed the rules, there is nothing wrong with sharing evidence of a suspected shill.</p>

<p>You guys are making it very obvious that you are up to something with this post and the character assassination of me....It got deleted (of course, by <a href="/u/Sabremesh">/u/Sabremesh</a>, who else), so Let it go, and stop following me around. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So let me get this right; it&#39;s okay for shills to harass us and astroturf the shit out of this sub. But, it&#39;s not okay to devise a way to out them that falls within the rules? Because that&#39;s what I saw in that thread; people talking about how to prove a shill is a shill without breaking rules. </p>

<p>And for the record, I didn&#39;t see u/mastigia encouraging the breaking of the rules. I saw him discussing how to go about accusing a suspected shill while not breaking any rules. </p>

<p>There is literally no problem with that, and the only people that would have a problem with it are the ones we want gone from this fucking sub. </p>

<p>I find it kinda fucked up that it&#39;s so hard to get rid of shills without getting banned. It&#39;s like there is built in protection for them. They&#39;re like fleas. You get one, and before you know it, you&#39;re infested. Only difference is we aren&#39;t being allowed to use a proper flea medicine to eradicate the issue ... </p>

<p>It&#39;s hard to see with your eyes closed! Since you&#39;re woefully uninformed, here you go buddy -</p>

<blockquote>
<p>mastigia - there is nothing in the rules that says you can&#39;t prove it. Just remember, the burden of proof for this is going to be high. Like higher than most of what we generally accept as proof around here.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Where did he break the rules? </p>

<p>He said you will NEED proof, and the burden of said proof would be very high. </p>

<p>He also made it clear rule breakers would be banned. </p>

<p>He never said go call people names, and accuse them of being a shill with no proof. THAT would be breaking the rules. </p>

<p>There is literally no rule saying you can&#39;t go about proving someone is a shill.</p>

<p>I suggest YOU open YOUR eyes, buttercup. </p>

<p>Except for the ban you&#39;ll receive after &#39;proving&#39; someone is a shill. You will never have enough proof to label someone a shill unless they make a copy of their paycheck and distribute it online. Of course people like yourself will say &quot;it&#39;s fake&quot; thus effectively eliminating the very users who aren&#39;t shills.</p>

<p>He&#39;s encouraging users to break rules. You can deny and obfuscate all day. It&#39;s a wasted effort. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Honeypot confirmed by your own bias. Well done, Inspector Gadget. :) </p>

<p>I&#39;m not gonna be banned if I out a shill on my own accord, and then privately go to a mod with my information, nor will anyone else. </p>

<p>I think the bigger concern for me is your sudden which hunt of said user. He has been around awhile, a lot of us know him. And we know he isn&#39;t a shill, nor setting a honey pot for existing users. </p>

<p>So why the hard on to go after him? Do you have a crush on him? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That post has been removed, and I am removing this one as well. </p>

<p>If you have genuine evidence that a user is being paid to push an agenda, please inform the mods and we will deal with it. If you only have a suspicion that someone is a shill, but no actual evidence, keep it to yourself - pretty much every user of this sub has ten people who think they might be a shill. Assume everybody is a shill and carry on.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Look dude, I didn&#39;t even read the thread. I just saw the title of the post and thought it was weird there was a post suggesting we break the rules was on the FP. I see now that you said screenshots in the title, but that didn&#39;t even register at the time. Which means that if this isn&#39;t what you meant in the post, then you worded the title in a way which could be misleading to people that don&#39;t click on it and actually read it. Therefore the people calling you out on it still have a point. </p>

<p>Looks to me like the reason your responses are getting to heavily downvoted isn&#39;t because of brigading, it&#39;s the way you&#39;re going about it. I&#39;d recommend trying to avoid going the angry route and insulting people, and stick to calm and concise rebuttals. You make good points, but no one will listen to you if you&#39;re a dick about it.</p>

<p>I know this post has been deleted, so I&#39;m just writing this for you really. If you don&#39;t agree with what I&#39;ve said, reply or PM me why. Trying to be an ally here, not an enemy.</p>
