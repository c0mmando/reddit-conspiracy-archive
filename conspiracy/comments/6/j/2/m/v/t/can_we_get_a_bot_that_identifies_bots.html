<p>Using his method, having a bot do it, seems like it could be powerful.  If you publish that, we could then possibly import it into RES to mark those accounts.</p>

<p>My worry though are the false positives.  People on mobile might trip as false positive because of their fast reply time as they are in app and see instant notification of messages.</p>

<p>Also a worry would be adaptive bots.  Bots that don&#39;t read their messages right away, don&#39;t click on links. Etc.  </p>

<p>Maybe we could somehow use google human verification?  Likely not.  Maybe it adds trouble as it reduces anonymity.</p>

<p>doxxing is exposing public identity.  by collecting IPs he was only slightly getting into this territory.  what he was really doing was, as you accurately point out, making a list of shills.  that&#39;s not doxxing.  that&#39;s making a list of shills.  </p>

<p>There&#39;s several users he&#39;s done this to. There&#39;s more evidence of that than there being bots on this board. If you could, find me some examples. I personally can&#39;t find anything that would be considered evidence that shills and or bots are even on here.</p>

<p>Nah that&#39;s an overgeneralization.  Bots are bots because they conform to certain limited interactions.  Shills conform to talking points.  Both can&#39;t scale their effect in a conversational way before outing themselves.  If we want to filter out bots we have to filter out people who pass the Turing test.  If we want to filter out shills we have to filter out by opinion/behaviour.  The former is way easier to do and reduces the set so that performing the latter is thus made much easier.  Either way, if we&#39;re using a single platform to keep 2 different sandboxes (unvetted, vetted) then this introduces the potential of coercion by the platform itself.  Better to have heterogeneity of platform for sandboxing, to mitigate that concern.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You probably want multiple metrics (think of them as lens filters) to identify actors who behave with specific behaviours.  But let&#39;s say that such a thing even exists, and it&#39;s shared on a platform where the data can&#39;t be corrupted/coopted, and it&#39;s transparent, etc - a non trivial challenge in itself.  Big Whoop, as they used to say.  You&#39;d still be deferring actual thought for the analysis of a 3rd party, and that&#39;s gonna be a bad time.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s look at the shill/bot problem itself.  Bots and shills can be scaled.  That means that in the firehose of info that this board gets, bots/shills can scale their influence and drown out the other data.  Are tools going to help identify this?  Sure, but it becomes a cat and mouse game like radar detectors and radar radar detectors, ad infinitum.  So probably only so useful.  </p>

<p>What else do we know about bots n shills?  They can&#39;t scale their longitudinality.  What does this even mean?  They can&#39;t maintain a detailed conversation without repeating themselves or identifying themselves as acting in a less than transparent or honest way.  They out themselves, in other words.  </p>

<p>So given this, what&#39;s a more effective way of filtering them out.  By filtering out everybody and only taking users who pass the longitudinal smell test.</p>

<p>That&#39;s how you deal with shills n bots.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My idea was along those lines but simpler.  It would allow all members to imput who they trust are humans.  Other people would have their list.  So the system could show a thread marked with the levels of separation people have.  Example, my friends would look one color, friends of friends maybe a second shade.  Friends of friends or friends (2 layers of separation)</p>

<p>Clicking on a user could show the friend path, so as to see who trusts who.</p>

<p>You can start to mark people negatively.  So if there is a corruption in the system, the flaw becomes &#39;rotten&#39;.  This would happen in the instance if someone sold their account, or if their account was taken over against their will.</p>

<p>It would also show negatively on anyone trusting bad entities.  So those that just trust anyone innocently would slowly lose their integrity rating.</p>

<p>Tl;dr: essentially it takes everyone&#39;s RES tags and merges them, showing people trends</p>
