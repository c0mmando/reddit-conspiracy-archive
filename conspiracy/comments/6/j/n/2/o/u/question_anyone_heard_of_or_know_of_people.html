       Someone close to me is having severe health issues and they confided in me that they think their brain is being hacked....they close there eyes and can see a chat where people are harassing them....says he can see the program boot up on his head....it's called dio something or other.....is it crazy??

       sure.  the brain is electrochemical.  technologies exist to affect this and are in the patent record.  the infrastructure to implement these broadcasts are in place and ubiquitous.

       No. You can maybe affect someone's mood or trigger a mental state with electric or chemical means, but actually "hacking" the brain suggests interacting with it on an informational level, implanting thoughts or memories or extracing those things. The actual, low level organization of the brain is still extremely mysterious to even the most advanced neuroscientists.

       yes well that's probably more or less what the public domain state of the art is.  the brain is very much a neural net, and programming neural nets in the domain of code is well understood.  if research was done converting this knowledge into physical application, you'd be well in the area of remapping neural nets.
      </p>
      <p>
       completely hypothetical, of course.  what techs could potentialy be used to interface with neurons at this resolution?   nanobots, engineered life, an externally broadcasting grid that could, like a sound field, initiate a high-resolution (to neural sizes) magnetic wobble.
      </p>
      <p>
       the plausibility of the tech is there.  Michael Crichton wrote about neural enhancement thru nanobots and brain implants, sourcing in the appendix the research supporting these applications.  we have one incident in recent memory where a politician was shot in the head and had an astounding recovery - exactly as Crichton wrote about.

       Really??? See I'm very interested if this is something people have experienced before....he says he asked why they are fucking with him he's inconsequential...they said it was for stuff that he said in certain online circles...it's not really a chat room but it's a company and it's their software....he's been told it's been around 30 years....it's only been happening to him since last week....I know he's had issues in past from his deep online stuff..I.e. He got SWATTED few years back....he definitely feels like they're targeting him and fucking with him and he says he's standing up to them ...some will continue to harass while others laugh like...ok,he's no fun to fuck with...and just zing one liners....I know this sounds crazy and stupid and I'm having a hard time relaying the situation on here...but honestly...I lean more towards believing him than thinking he's loosing his marbles....it's not like he's a mess of a person...he's not...it seems he's stumbled into some next level shit but idk

       ) then you're funnelled into certain behavioural coercions.  this might explain the gangstalking allegations.  anyway, if this thesis is true, then it would make sense for people on the margins would be targeted because they're less capable of enlisting support for their case.

       No he hasn't....he's usually very intelligent and articulate ...he is very red pilled I'd say...he is into deep computer stuff ...spends most of his time on various sites I've never heard of...he turned me on to this sub years ago but has advanced past Reddit etc....so it's hard for me to explain....he's said that he's getting gang stalked using some digital remote software....he closes his eyes,while awake, and can see the program that boots up...called diotesus or something...he says people chat ,show him pics from relatives instagram...photos he hasn't seen before...other stuff......I trust him that he believes this is happening...he doesn't seem crazy, mentally disturb or unhinged in any way....he hasn't told anyone but me...I'm just curious if anyone has heard of or experienced anything similar?

       Yea that's my initial reaction but he's very normal...I've known him since he was born...and him confiding in me was because I'm the only one who is somewhat redpilled so to speak....he knows I love this sub and I'd be somewhat open minded to what's happening...idk...I'm worried and very curious

       Any chance he dabbles in drugs like disassociatives or meth or psychedelics or research chemicals?   Because shit like that, used over time, can make one believe things are happening to him.

       No...not that I'm aware of....he's a normal person honestly....smarter than most I'd say....I know he drinks on occasion but nothing in excess...my gut says he's gotten into something deeper than I can relate too...but my mind screams that he's going crazy....if it wasn't for him confiding in me...I'd never suspect anything was out of the norm

       It's something to keep in mind.    I've done more than my share of strange and obscure drugs that are available online or over the counter even and they have made my brain talk to me in ways that were quite strange.   I can easily see abuse of some substances bringing about these sorts of delusions.

       There are so many methods it seems to be easy and common.
      </p>
      <p>
       I had previously researched on understanding human behavior, specifically addiction which I never felt was a result of "bad choices," but a product of early childhood damage.  I have been gratified to have my belief that it is a brain dysfunction  not an intellectual or conscious or unconscious choice but not many focus on the origins of the damage only that it is a brain path dysfunction.

       You have to be careful. Like it's incredible how much you can affect your reality through your beliefs.
      </p>
      <p>
       If someone has paranoid thoughts constantly, they draw people's eyes towards them and sometimes even being scared that people will approach you randomly causes that to happen.
      </p>
      <p>
       If he had a mental break, then he will act differently causing people to act differently around him and cause a feedback loop which feeds into his paranoia.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can always cling to specific scenarios and ask why they're happening, but he should focus on logic based things like has he been stolen from? Are the same people stalking him? Things that aren't just weird circumstances but are based on actual tangible evidence.

       Your friend really needs to see a mental help professional. Even if brain hacking were possible (it isn't, yet) it wouldn't manifest in any way where closing your eyes would make a chat room appear. Your friend may be having a mental break.

       So your friend tells you that he thinks someone is hacking his brain and when he closes his eyes he sees a chat room with people harassing him. And your first instinct is to post on
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy

       No...definitely not my first instinct......I've confided in another person in medical field who also suggested mental   Evaluation...tried to do some research....it's so out of the normal with him ...I came here to ask if anyone has head of anything similar that wasn't a direct correlation to mental illness....but thanks for your judgements reply

       I doubt it was their

       instinct.  I'm sure many of us, conspiracy theorists or not, might suspect a mental illness first, possibly schizophrenia. I probably would.

       <em>

       , if this person isn't a danger to themselves or others, and has family or something watching over them, then yeah.. I'd probably come here too to see if anyone has heard of what his friend is talking about, or at least look it up.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean, you can tell, ask or suggest that a friend seek mental help, but that's literally all you can do in that situation unless they're a danger to someone.

       Just look into it for your friends sake. If they trust you enough to share this stuff with you, you might be able to help convince him to seek help for himself.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have had a friend who had ALWAYS been really smart and then at some point in their early to mid 20's started seeing patterns in things that weren't actually there, projecting their interpretations of events and the  assumed intentions on those around them. Long story short, he ended up abandoning his fiance and kids and became a drifter.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just be careful how you approach this topic with them, if you do. You don't want to ruin the chance you might have to help them through this.

       Yes thank you....I'm trying to be understanding and sensitive.....I'll definitely be pushing for some kind of mental health care in a non evasive way....but there's a part of me who actually believes him and worries this is a legit possible scenario and not a mental breakdown

       Yea that's my initial reaction but he's very normal...I've known him since he was born...and him confiding in me was because I'm the only one who is somewhat redpilled so to speak....he knows I love this sub and I'd be somewhat open minded to what's happening...idk...I'm worried and very curious
