       Back in 2016 the New York Times took it upon itself to aggressively defend a certain pizza shop in Washington, pushing out article after article aimed at stifling reasonable discussion and ridiculing those who were concerned. And despite 'pizzagate' being
       <em>
        such
       </em>
       a ridiculous hoax, for some reason they still found it necessary to specifically insist that this place has no basement.

       This I found curious. So I was a little hung up on this photo

       Which was posted by Comet Ping Pong and just happens to look exactly like a level beneath

        this one

       (also Comet Ping Pong) should look. Thoughts?

       The art is specifically tongue in cheek pedo talk though.  It's like thinking your neighbor has a grow-op because he wears green 420 shirts all the time;  maybe he just
       <em>
        really
       </em>
       likes 20 times 21, oorrr...

       Man, I thought maybe you were actual passionate about pizzagate. I guess you're just another person who has been duped by fear-mongering media personalities who profit from your outrage...

       I could easily provide sources (that's my point) - I just enjoy exposing your intent. I think some other users on here will chuckle at this.

       I'm not denying anything. Merely pointing out the incredibly spurious nature of the arguments.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also enjoy seeing people flounder when you apply the Socratic method to pizzagate.

      <p>
       The more questions you ask a pizzagater, the less sense they make, and the more hostile they become. It's an amusing pattern, actually.

       Tell me which one specifically is "suspicious" to you.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is it the one with a halloween costume involving blood? Ohhhh so spooky and suspicious.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or what about the one with children eating pizza at a sleep over? Super fucking creepy for a pizza shop to post pics of happy children eating pizza, right?
      </p>
      <p>
       I guess maybe the one with a gay man making a joke about cum pandas is pretty suspicious. Except, you, that gay men make jokes about cum fetishes sometimes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hmmm... maybe the first one where Obama is shown playing ping poong with a kid is direct evidence of a satanic pedo ring. Oh wait, no, it's a PR stunt in a public place with the POTUS playing a game with some kid.
      </p>
      <p>
       Although, now that I think about, a pizza place posting instagram photos of a baby eating it's first slice of pizza is actually incredibly suspicious. Oh fuck, I meant incredibly normal.

       You're a fucking shill. He cited a bunch a sources we've all seen from the CPP and others' instagram account. Now you claim those don't count or he needs links? You're a fucking shill and cancer on democracy. There are victims you're mocking and criminals you're assisting. Fuck off.

       I'm not a bot and I just down voted you because you don't know what you're talking about. Alefantis (owner of CPP) posted to a photo to his instagram of a baby and added the hashtag "hoe tard" beneath it. This is one of more than a dozen super-creepy and questionable photos that he posted to his instagram before making his account private when pizzagate blew up. These posts are archived and can be found by googling them. The only reason you "haven't seen one instance of this" is b cause you haven't looked.

       The basement floor under CPP is not physically linked to CPP. It is an extension of Buck's Fishing and Camping's basement, which is also owned by Alefantis.

       By saying there's no basement in CPP, they're truthful in their statement but simply dodging the real question.

       This is the real kicker.  It's pretty much public knowledge that DC is covered (undercovered?) with tunnels. CPP is right there, along w/ several other alefantis related properties across the city similarly close to known tunnels.
