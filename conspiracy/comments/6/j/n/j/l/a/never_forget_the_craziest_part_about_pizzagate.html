<p>Or is this just new reddit algo where the numbers go all over the place randomly within some bounds?</p>

With Trump is was a toss up until he filled out his administration.

    <div class="md"><p>The MSM is the entity which provides narratives, as evidenced by the recent video of the CNN producer admitting that their &quot;stories&quot; are all about the ratings and money. Journalistic integrity is gone in the mainstream news. So I agree that the MSM&#39;s portrayal of pizzagate is dishonest and lacking any actual true investigative journalism. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My comment was actually sarcastic, if you were familiar with it you would totally get it. </p>

<p>Anyhow, this post here is about the original FBIanon post, afaik it was the original. And in it he specifically states that he put some red herrings in the mix to obscure his identity, or to build plausible deniability. So, he made this post on pol that outlined a series of predictions and infobites about Hillary Clinton, the Clinton Foundation, and a bunch of the behind the scenes skulduggery that was happening during the election. This was just prior to the DNC leaks and Pizzagate getting unearthed. The most emphatic thing this guy said was the key was the Clinton Foundation, and follow the money. My personal theory is he was trying to point us to the Haiti incident, where a Clinton associate got caught trying to kidnap a bunch of children. He was hinting at Pizzagate before there was a Pizzagate to talk about.</p>

<p>See lines 829-831</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Q:  Are the people leading the investigation blackmailed pedophiles?</p>

<p>A:  No. The people under the magnifying glass do have an affinity for children.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Lines 1240-1242:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Q:  Please, before you sleep, speak a little on the child prostitution ring.</p>

<p>A:  Sex rings are popular in all governments, but pedophilia is primary in British parliament and Saudia Arabia, and that&#39;s why Hillary and Bill love foreign donors so much. They get paid in children as well as money. Dig deep and you can find it. It will sicken you.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There were many more  &quot;FBI anon&quot; variants or whatever, but imo the only one that actually came true to any great degree was this one. I think there may have been one other real one, but I think it is more likely this guy was identified and killed after posting this. It seems we had a reason to believe that, but my memory is hazy in that regard. And subsequent FBIanon posts were likely larp or outright disinformation. </p>

<p>I think someone else can give you a better sequence of events and fill in the details. But that is the gist.</p>

The Germans hated the Jews and thought the Jews were up to evil fuckery, including causing WWI and the German&#39;s defeat.

    <div class="md"><p>The Jews caused a civil war in Germany before Hitler, machine gunning down innocents - that is one reason they were put in Labour camps and hated
<a href="http://i.imgur.com/dHs7xBy.jpg">http://i.imgur.com/dHs7xBy.jpg</a>
They were also trying to institute Communism across Europe and controlled the press
<a href="http://i.imgur.com/M3gj4I0.jpg">http://i.imgur.com/M3gj4I0.jpg</a></p>

<p>Jews worldwide were in an ideological battle with Nazi germany from the beginning for no good moral reason. International Jews used their power to force both Britain (through Winston Churchill controlled by the Rothschilds) and later America to invade Nazi Germany and shut it down at all costs because it was a threat to worldwide Jewish power over us.</p>

<p>The Jews needed an excuse for why so many westerners died fighting this pointless war and they also had to drown out news of the 10s of millions of Europeans and Russians who were genocided by Jewish Communism - they also needed to make sure Hitler NEVER happened again anywhere in the world - they created the lie about the Holocaust. There were no gas chambers for killing people. There was no campaign to wipe out Jews. Far less than a million Jews died during the war by accident (10s of millions of non Jews died). Jews that died in these labour camps died at the end of the war due to the Allies bombing all the German supply routes, starving camps and stopping medical supplies which led to typhus epidemics.  </p>

<p>The Holocaust lie is repeated ad infinitum because it quashes anyone being &#39;antisemitic&#39; which really just means anyone the Jews don&#39;t like. It stops people investigating the Jewish power structure to this day, the mainstream lying media is Jewish, the Central banks are Jewish, Academia and social engineering are Jewish.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nevermind. I looked it up:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The German Revolution or November Revolution (German: Novemberrevolution) was a civil conflict in the German Empire at the end of the First World War that resulted in the replacement of the German federal constitutional monarchy with a democratic parliamentary republic that later became known as the Weimar Republic. The revolutionary period lasted from November 1918 until the adoption in August 1919 of the Weimar constitution.</p>

<p>The causes of the revolution were the extreme burdens suffered by the population during the four years of war, the strong impact of the defeat on the German Empire and the social tensions between the general population and the elite of aristocrats and bourgeoisie who held power and had just lost the war.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How terrible. They overthrew a monarchy and started a democracy. The Weimar Republic was pretty progressive, as far as I recall.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It was a claim by a local reporter Brenda Corpian that two police officers spoke to her anonymously about Howell calling 911 and needing protection.  The police chief that morning tweeted that Howell was going to the parade to cause harm, which seemed ominous.  I thought he had more of an arsenal in his vehicle, including stuff he would&#39;ve been hard-pressed to put together himself, but now that I&#39;m looking back it&#39;s tough to convince myself that Brenda Corpian didn&#39;t just make it all up.</p>

<p>Q:  Is plausible deniability the reason why you have brought up things that would get us insta-discredited if we tried to bring up this conversation as a source? I mean, even if we humor your argument that aliens are real and the Jews are trying to dominate the world, it won&#39;t be accepted by the public as credible no matter how much truth about the Clinton Foundation you intermingle with it. This is a protective strategy, I presume?</p>

<p>A: <strong>I said life exists elsewhere. Some people chose to interpret that as aliens.</strong> My protective strategy is posting outrageous claims on /pol/ with no evidence, which is standard protocol and raises no alarms. &quot;Fake and gay,&quot; just remember.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yea and I researched it, you apperently didnt, use google search and search by date (when the fake news spike happened). You claimed they invented the term &quot;fake news&quot; to discredit it but from the graph you can clear see it existed before and it spiked before pizzagate. Besides corrolation does not mean causation. I posted on a thread like this 2 months ago:</p>

<p>Trump actively popularized the term &quot;fake news&quot;, in fact some of the spikes coincide with trump tweets. Go to google trends search them both. Now look when his tweets are made;</p>

<p>1: Big spike when trump tweets;</p>

<p>-Any negative polls are fake news, just like the CNN, ABC, NBC polls. in the election. Sorry, people want border security and extreme vetting. 6 feb</p>

<p>2: Big spike when trump tweets;</p>

<p>-FAKE NEWS - A TOTAL POLITICAL WITCH HUNT! 10 jan And -Intelligence agencies should never have allowed this fake news to &quot;leak&quot; into the public. One last shot at me.Are we living in Nazi Germany? 11 jan</p>

<p>-I win an election easily, a great &quot;movement&quot; is verified, and crooked opponents try to belittle our victory with FAKE NEWS. A sorry state! 11 jan</p>

<p>-&#39;BuzzFeed Runs Unverifiable Trump-Russia Claims&#39; #FakeNews 10 jan</p>

<p>-Dishonest media says Mexico won&#39;t be paying for the wall if they pay a little later so the wall can be built more quickly. Media is fake! 8 jan</p>

<p>-Kellyanne Conway went to @MeetThePress this morning for an interview with @chucktodd. Dishonest media cut out 9 of her 10 minutes. Terrible!</p>

<p>-In his press conference, calling CNN very fake news 11 jan</p>

<p>3: First spike;</p>

<p>-Was mostly about fake news being spread on facebook and all kinds of stories connected to it. Including stories about zuckerberg (attacking him) -Sean hannity apoligizing for airing a fake story about obama etc</p>

<p>So it kinda correlates with all these things instead of pizzagate. Why didnt you research it?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When are you the final authority on a lie? The term was targeted at pizzagaters. Is your issue semantics? A label specifically targeted by the media to discredit a movement is synonmymous with a label used inventively at the pizzagate movement to discredit. You are arguing for no reason and it&#39;s sliding the conversation. Maybe find a post you enjoy and can contribute to positively. You would probably enjoy a lot more.</p>

3. Was it used by alt media and grass roots investigators on propaganda pushed by MSM to discredit their competitors? Yes. 
See sometimes to win you have to use your enemies tactics against them. The media exposed their hand by using the fake news term to discredit and ended up discrediting themselves. The MSM are a bunch of actors pretending to be journalists. Now more people than ever know how much the media lies with their psy op techniques.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I associate it far more with Trump supporters dismissing anything that paints Putin (weird) or Trump in a bad light, then I do with Pizzagate. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t watch MSM, though, so, understandably, I hear it much more from Trump fans than a source I don&#39;t listen to at all. </p>

<p>I guess my point was that it wasn&#39;t a concerted coordinated effort to &quot;Discredit Pizzagate.&quot; It&#39;s a term that&#39;s been around a long time and is used by both wings of the same rotten bird. </p>

<p>While the left/right paradigm is mostly a divide and conquer sham, some of us really rely on medicaid, and it&#39;s troubling to me that masses of Trump supporters seem totally apathetic about that. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are lumping all trump supporters into one group. I am in my forties and I have only heard that term used by the media once it was when the pizzagate investigation was blowing up, it coincided with the Ben swann expose, and the mike Flynn tweets. The fake news label was targeted to stop the momentum that pizzagate was literally going viral. Now was it used against any other group strategically like that? I don&#39;t know, I never saw a coordinated effort like that before. Maybe you have? I am not the expert on this, I am only speaking from personal point of view. I did follow the pizzagate issue very closely. I can say it was a coordinated planned discrediting attack. Was it used in the past? I never saw anything like that before. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I haven&#39;t heard any Trump supporters complaining about the guy they got in office appointing as heads to administrations people who want to destroy those administrations and openly say they shouldn&#39;t exist, worrying about those of us who benefited greatly from the ACA and are going to be in horrible shape if Medicaid and mental health funding get slashed, worrying about how he filled his cabinet with extremely wealthy Goldman Sachs people when he promised to Drain the Swamp, etc, etc. </p>

<p>Like I said, I don&#39;t watch the MSM, but every time I communicate with someone from The_Donald on here and show them something that portrays Putin and/or Trump in a bad light (why do Trump supporters love this ex-KGB spymaster billionaire who runs Russia? He&#39;s like the epitome of a rep of The Deep State) they, almost invariably, respond with, &quot;That&#39;s just Fake News!&quot; They do this when I show them direct quotes by Putin. It&#39;s bizarre. </p>

<p>The term first came to my attention, not due to pizzagate, but bc Trump and his supporters started using it. As it&#39;s been documented to have been in use for over 100 years, I think it&#39;s impossible to argue it was literally &quot;coined to discredit Pizzagate.&quot; </p>

<p>Was it used to diminish the public&#39;s opinion on the veracity of the Pizzagate story? Absolutely. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>ACA is a mess. The government is broken, believe me if they are going to get rid of it there is nothin you or I could do. We have no power as provate citizens. Unless you want to bring out the pitchforks and tar and feather the lot. 
I qualify for ACA but I canceled it. True story: I would pay my monthly premium, they would say it was not recieved. Suddenly at the end of the month they would apply it to the month. Except it was too late to utilize the insurance. doctors won&#39;t charge your insurance unless they preauthorize and verify your insurance. You know what blue cross and blue shield would say to me? If it is life and death go to closest emergency room. So after 10 months I canceled it. What good is an insurance plan that only covers you the 4 days of a month? Just because they say people have coverage does not mean they actually have coverage. Trump hikacked the fake news term against the fake news outlets that were labeling the pizzagate movement as fake news. More power to him. The media and the deep state are the real culprits. I qualified and had a lovely plan under the ACA, yet I had no plan. Supposedly the new package will triple spending on Medicaid under the republicans. Supposedly the other side of the aisle is saying there will be death panels. Meanwhile, nothing will change yet we fight each other. Instead of fighting the clowns in dc, that keep linking health care coverage to employment when it should just be a buying group like belonging to credit union or a costco. But the media will create these fake news ploys ( medicaid people will be dropped) to distract from the real issue, no one is dc will change anything....and they are above the law. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You may be right, I was following pizzagate very closely, the Russia issue came after I think when Flynn started tweeting about pizzagate. Suddenly the Russia story was on every news outlet. I think the Russia story was how they discredited the higher ups who legitimized the pizzagate story with their public comments. Flynn Alex jones and Steve pezniack were all accused of Russian collusion only after they spoke publicly of pizzagate. </p>

<p>As to the ACA, I can tell you my story if you like. Simply put just because there is a law on the books does not mean there is any actual service or benefit behind it. I paid my monthly premium on time every month. And every month Blue cross and Blue shield lost the payment and only credited the account for the last 4 days of every month. Their solution when I complained was to tell me to go to the ER. After 10 months of paying for health insurance I voluntarily cancelled and pay the fine instead. Thanks Obama for nothing! 
Washington DC is broken nothing will change. Insurance should not be connected to employment. We should be able to form buying groups similar to credit unions, or Costco and buy insurance. That will never happen because our government has priorituzed military spending over health care. So when you worry about Medicaid their is nothing you can do. Or I can do unless you are ready to tar and feather all their asses, left and right and the deep state too. Nothing will change Medicaid is great only if doctors would accept it. There are very few doctors who take Medicaid so good luck gettting access. Sorry for sounding negative but they want you focused on Putin and Medicaid meanwhile they make their back room deals and enrich them selves. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am very glad it worked out for you. It does not for most people though. Medicaid is in crisis since there are very few docs that take it. Doctors don&#39;t want Medicaid patients because the reimbursement rate is low. So you have no choice in choosing a doctor. That is class warfare. Same with the VA. A government plan should benefit the most people possible. Some states did not expand Medicaid and some people could no longer afford their health insurance. It&#39;s a tangled mess that just ensures the poorer classes have less choice and poor people should not be ok with that. The ACA is a mess. But then what do I know I am just a private citizens that believe in equal acsess for all people despite ability to pay. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The ACA provided equal access regardless of income in a much better way than the &quot;mean&quot; Trumpare bill will. </p>

<p>I go to group with many mentally ill people on Medicaid. They&#39;ve all found therapists, nurse practitioners or psychiatrists to rx psych drugs, and group therapy through Medicaid. Trump wants to cut that. That&#39;s not &quot;equal acsess for all people despite ability to pay,&quot; no matter how you look at it. </p>

<p>Previously you said mental health services were already lost. I know from personal experience that&#39;s not the case. However, if the Medicaid budget slashes go through, I guarantee you that good people I know are going to suffer. Some of us may become homeless, as the housing budgets are being threatened as well. Some of us may lose the ability to contribute to society as well, as their vocational program is in great jeopardy. </p>

<p>Real people, good people, rely on and benefit from Medicaid and other social services for the disadvantaged. It&#39;s heartless to take that away, especially when it will only primarily benefit the ultra-wealthy.  It&#39;s not good for the average guy who voted for Trump thinking he was going to MAGA.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is used to control us. But why would you say it&#39;s fake? The Germans hated the Jews and thought the Jews were up to evil fuckery, including causing WWI and the German&#39;s defeat. There&#39;s no reason to fabricate the holocaust as a justification to form Israel. The reason they formed Israel was the intense persecution of the times. So why would you need to lie about the level of persecution?</p>
