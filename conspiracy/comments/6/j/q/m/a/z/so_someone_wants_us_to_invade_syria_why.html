       I noticed that after Assad agreed to the oil pipeline with Russia, ISIS popped up. Now that they are being defeated, "chemical attacks" are occurring (as apparently the White House is saying Assad is planning another one.)
So, why? It's all BS. Were they trying to nationalize their banks or is it to stop Russia from stabilizing their economy so THEY can nationalize their banks? 
or is it something else?

       Yes. They are trying to destroy history. No different than the burning of the Library of Alexandria... They are erasing history, while people are focused on "IS", oil, and god damn knows what else. Why would Muslims destroy Muslim History? They are not Muslims. This is the modern day crusades, just reframed. Wake up people. Oil is not finite. TPTB control the ME, because that is where are history comes from... Honestly, I'm waiting for another Deluge, this is what they will do.. They did it in the past..

       Oil is not finite? Y'know, I hear a some oil workers say the same thing but geo scientists tend to disagree.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if you think that oil will replace itself within the earth eventually, (I don't get how this is expected but lets run with it) there is a finite supply. Your body will replace lost blood, but that doesn't mean you don't have a finite amount of blood.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sucking oil out of the ground depletes the earth of it's natural lubricants that ease tectonic shifts. I don't really know what to expect when a plate goes to shift and can't due to lack of viscosity but I know that lack of lubricant can make even the most fun activities very painful.

       Biogenic or abiogenic is irrelevant to whether or not oil is a finite resource.

       If you're a flat earther then oil doesn't even make any sense. Neither do volcanoes. I'm not interested in that conversation in the slightest.

       In Afghanistan, at least, most of the history that was destroyed was Buddhist.

       Afghanistan was a war for minerals, position (keep Ruskies from Indian ocean) and publicity. Iraq was a war for oil.

       I feel we may be generalizing several different occurrences and trying to shoehorn the same meaning (destroy history) into them here.

       "Basic nonsense: the fight is over Iran vs Syria pipelines. Assad = Iran pipeline, "Rebels" = Saudi pipeline.
      </p>
      <p>
       Next level: the fight is about blocking both pipelines. Look up the Leviathan oil field discovery in 2010. Syrian conflict starts shortly thereafter. Offshore deposits are more expensive, so Iran AND Saudi pipelines need to be blocked to make Leviathan field viable. You'd want to drag out the conflict in this scenario (as is happening).
      </p>
      <p>
       Woke level: The triangulation described above is only a small part of the picture, capable of deceiving smart but uninformed people. Read about ISIS obsession with destroying ancient sites. When you realize that Syria, Iran, and North Korea are some of the only places in the world where ancient sites haven't been covered up / destroyed, then you start seeing that the war machine is really about covering up human history. Mystery Babylon doesn't want people getting exposed to incontrovertible evidence that almost everything they know is a lie, down to basic 101 facts you learned in history class.

       The entire purpose of the war in Syria is about fulfilling prophecy from the bible.

       <strong>
        Isaiah 17:1
       </strong>
       - The burden of Damascus. Behold, Damascus is taken away from being a city, and it shall be a ruinous heap.

       Revelation 16:12 - And the sixth angel poured out his vial upon the great river Euphrates; and the water thereof was dried up, that the way of the kings of the east might be prepared.

       the US is going to invade Syria. Remember that Orwell told us that wars are fake, and we only believe them because they are on our telescreens. Orwell also told us to question

       How could you read the book three times and miss this part:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Once when he happened in some connexion to mention the war against Eurasia, she startled him by saying casually that in her opinion the war was not happening. The rocket bombs which fell daily on London were probably fired by the Government of Oceania itself, 'just to keep people frightened'. This was an idea that had literally never occurred to him.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The masses only believe in war becuase of what they are taught in school (which Orwell points out is indoctrination) and what is on their TVs. Another quote from the book:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Life, if you looked about you, bore no resemblance not only to the lies that streamed out of the telescreens, but even to the ideals that the Party had to achieve.
       </p>

       1984 alludes to its best to be suspicious of the official narrative of war indeed - yet by an large Orwell doesn't say war is fake. Homage to Catalonia is excellent and a first hand account of the Spanish civil war...

       You're missing his point. He isn't saying all war is fake. He is saying in the context of 1984 the story, the state was faking wars.

       Lol you serious? He references 1984 and all you do is tell him he's wrong and bring up another book.

       That part of the book was eye opening for me. Because I had never considered that either and once you read that part you will forever become a conspiracy theorist. LOL
