<p>Yes. They are trying to destroy history. No different than the burning of the Library of Alexandria... They are erasing history, while people are focused on &quot;IS&quot;, oil, and god damn knows what else. Why would Muslims destroy Muslim History? They are not Muslims. This is the modern day crusades, just reframed. Wake up people. Oil is not finite. TPTB control the ME, because that is where are history comes from... Honestly, I&#39;m waiting for another Deluge, this is what they will do.. They did it in the past..</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oil is not finite? Y&#39;know, I hear a some oil workers say the same thing but geo scientists tend to disagree. </p>

<p>Even if you think that oil will replace itself within the earth eventually, (I don&#39;t get how this is expected but lets run with it) there is a finite supply. Your body will replace lost blood, but that doesn&#39;t mean you don&#39;t have a finite amount of blood.</p>

<p>Sucking oil out of the ground depletes the earth of it&#39;s natural lubricants that ease tectonic shifts. I don&#39;t really know what to expect when a plate goes to shift and can&#39;t due to lack of viscosity but I know that lack of lubricant can make even the most fun activities very painful. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>See <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/64efor/why_did_obama_back_down/dg1ie0e/">this post</a> by u/ClosedSociety404:</p>

<p>&quot;Basic nonsense: the fight is over Iran vs Syria pipelines. Assad = Iran pipeline, &quot;Rebels&quot; = Saudi pipeline.</p>

<p>Next level: the fight is about blocking both pipelines. Look up the Leviathan oil field discovery in 2010. Syrian conflict starts shortly thereafter. Offshore deposits are more expensive, so Iran AND Saudi pipelines need to be blocked to make Leviathan field viable. You&#39;d want to drag out the conflict in this scenario (as is happening).</p>

<p>Woke level: The triangulation described above is only a small part of the picture, capable of deceiving smart but uninformed people. Read about ISIS obsession with destroying ancient sites. When you realize that Syria, Iran, and North Korea are some of the only places in the world where ancient sites haven&#39;t been covered up / destroyed, then you start seeing that the war machine is really about covering up human history. Mystery Babylon doesn&#39;t want people getting exposed to incontrovertible evidence that almost everything they know is a lie, down to basic 101 facts you learned in history class.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Once when he happened in some connexion to mention the war against Eurasia, she startled him by saying casually that in her opinion the war was not happening. The rocket bombs which fell daily on London were probably fired by the Government of Oceania itself, &#39;just to keep people frightened&#39;. This was an idea that had literally never occurred to him.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The masses only believe in war becuase of what they are taught in school (which Orwell points out is indoctrination) and what is on their TVs. Another quote from the book:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Life, if you looked about you, bore no resemblance not only to the lies that streamed out of the telescreens, but even to the ideals that the Party had to achieve.</p>
