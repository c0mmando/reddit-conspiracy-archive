<p>They will smugly ask for evidence, or say that the current evidence isn&#39;t good enough, and will then proceed to make haughty comments deriding <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> members as nutbags. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying we should lower our standards for evidence in any way. </p>

<p>My issue however is that we are usually talking about conspiracy <em>theories</em> here. Theories! For genuine members here, it is implied that we have to take everything with a grain of salt, but to also keep an open mind. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Of course, the theory should have a foundation or premise that could be believable.</p>

<p>Where it gets a bit deraily is people asking for hard evidence when they know it doesn&#39;t exist (remember, they&#39;re theories), or if they&#39;re not happy with what evidence exists currently. Some theories need time for the evidence to gestate. People should also have an imagination to entertain connecting seemingly disparate dots. </p>

<p>A conspiracy theory could even be finding out a friend of a friend is cheating on their spouse. You tell another friend (who knows them too) what you suspect but don&#39;t have any hard evidence. Ideally they&#39;d take that info on board and play it by ear until further developments. They could also demand for hard evidence : &quot;Do you have photos? I won&#39;t believe you until you have them. Greg has been happily married to Christine after his conversion therapy succeeded 
Father Rob told me it worked and I believe him. He even showed me a certificate saying it worked.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I actually really enjoyed reading this interaction. Thanks to both of you.</p>

<p>I would just like to add what i think is an often overlooked, but very important thing to remember: If a conspiracy theory is actually true, there is an automatic handicap of evidence. It is being hidden and suppressed. That means making sure evidence is not a concern for the conspirators. So there needs to be a platform which accepts this and functions accordingly, whilst still maintaining the integrity of the scientific method and basic (and advanced) investigative skills. For both sides of the argument. It has seemed to have disappeared.</p>

<p>I&#39;m always skeptical of conspiracy theories, but I have learned that there is a reason to consider them. Some of them turn out to be correct, when before it&#39;s globally accepted as fact, it seemed there was never enough evidence for it to be true to most people. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The best way to support any given conspiracy is through logic, reasoning and analogy. Why?</p>

<p>Any time you try and say a conspiracy theory is true because of whatever evidence, the skeptics always reject the validity of the evidence. Why? Mostly because of cognitive dissonance.</p>

<p>It would take a lot of mental effort to change up their worldview to accommodate the new evidence/information. So they react emotionally and reject the information in an irrational way.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a lot better to ask questions and get a skeptic to defend their position. You only have to ask 2 or 3 questions until you reach the point where a false perception starts to look absurd.</p>

<p>e.g. Federal Reserve was set up by a few rich people to keep everyone in debt slavery. Here&#39;s the evidence. To which a skeptic will say &quot;No that&#39;s crazy, no way that&#39;s how things work because it would never be tolerated!&quot;</p>

<p>Alternative tactic... ask the skeptic if they know how the Fed Reserve system works. Usually they say no. Then you ask them if they knew how fractional reserve banking works, what are the implications of debt based money etc.</p>

<p>This way works better because now you&#39;ve got someone asking questions and thinking for themselves. You&#39;ve got them involved in a learning process instead of provoking a defensive reaction.</p>

<p>The best way to support any given conspiracy is through logic, reasoning and analogy. Why?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Empiricism, evidence, and healthy skepticism help us figure out if something is true. If you should be skeptical of the mainstream, why not be skeptical of alternative theories as well? It&#39;s not like infowars, naturalnews, or some Sandy Hook blog don&#39;t have financial motivations to make you click their site.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Any time you try and say a conspiracy theory is true because of whatever evidence, the skeptics always reject the validity of the evidence. Why? Mostly because of cognitive dissonance.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Or, maybe the &quot;evidence&quot; in these cases doesn&#39;t withstand basic scrutiny. You&#39;d have to be more specific.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>A skeptic&#39;s position is &quot;claims require evidence&quot; which is <em>healthy</em> for investigation. Are you anti-investigation and anti-research?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>e.g. Federal Reserve was set up by a few rich people to keep everyone in debt slavery. Here&#39;s the evidence.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You didn&#39;t provide evidence. I don&#39;t even disagree, but you didn&#39;t.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>To which a skeptic will say &quot;No that&#39;s crazy, no way that&#39;s how things work because it would never be tolerated!&quot;</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t say that.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>I mean, a skeptic <em>starts</em> by asking questions. It has nothing to do with defensiveness. </p>

<p>Considering you have &quot;tactics&quot; to &quot;deal with&quot; skepticism, it sounds like you&#39;re the defensive one.</p>

Obviously, evidence is <em>ultimately</em> the only thing that matters - but some people really, really will deny solid evidence that is presented to them by a &quot;regular&quot; person (cousin, coworker, random Internet stranger, etc) but they will find it much more difficult to deny evidence that they collect on their own. That doesn&#39;t mean *don&#39;t provide anybody with evidence ever</p>

<p>No, what I&#39;m getting at is a well understood phenomenon. Once you choose to believe something, it becomes established in a very interesting way.</p>

<p>People will actually react to an ideological challenge the same way (at a neurological level) they react to a physical threat. Namely, they get fearful/hostile/emotional.</p>

<p>Once this reaction is set off, you&#39;re no longer dealing with a rational person. So all the empiricism, evidence, and healthy skepticism in the world isn&#39;t going to change their mind.</p>

<p>The point I was trying to make (not contradicting you btw) is that you need to <strong>use a strategy that bypasses this reaction</strong>. If you know how people think and react under different circumstances, you have a better ability to communicate effectively with them.</p>

<p>tldr; How the message is delivered is just as important as what&#39;s in the message itself.</p>

<p>Isn&#39;t this what you said?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I mean, a skeptic starts by asking questions.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So if you&#39;re going to turn someone else into a skeptic, don&#39;t you have to get <em>them</em> to start asking questions too?</p>

<p>I do believe this, I&#39;ve seen it over and over again. BUT...</p>

<p>BUT, a rational person CAN put their emotions aside and listen to a reasonable argument with which they fundamentally disagree. I mean, it does happen.</p>

<p>I do agree with you on a whole, though. It&#39;s not really my fault if people react so emotionally that they&#39;re incapable of listening to someone. That&#39;s just a point where it&#39;s more about their inability to reason than my inability to reason. I&#39;ll at least listen to and consider a flat-earther if they actually debate in some good faith. </p>

<p>Haven&#39;t seen that one yet, but I would try!</p>

<p>The evidence for it is scattered, distorted, hidden, often poisoned by absurdities intentionally injected into the discourse.  But if you study all the separate small-c conspiracies, sifting the wheat from the chaff, discerning what is probably True from what is probably False, you&#39;ll start to see how they all support the main Conspiracy.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I, personally, would not put it in those exact terms, but I think it is a tolerable description of my understanding, if viewed from a slightly different perspective.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>God has allowed another dominion over this world for a time.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is central to the issue, especially the nature of &quot;another dominion&quot;, as well as an understanding of its interests and its methods.  Keep in mind, though, that the concept of &quot;time&quot; may not be a faithful representation of the organizing principle that matters for this issue.  Or, put in other terms, there may be no &quot;final battle of good and evil&quot; in the &quot;last days&quot;, the final battle may be eternal, outside-of-time, and within the heart of each individual.  In fact, time itself may be either one of the traps set by &quot;another dominion&quot;, or at the very least is one of the theaters of conflict that must be transcended (or at least understood for its true illusory nature). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>God conspired against himself by creating beings that thirst for others fear and suffering. They are incentivized to conceal the nature of God from God&#39;s incarnations. They are who teach us that believing God is in all things, even ourselves, is blasphemy. It is ironic how people seek salvation in a slave seeking overlord who only feigns love for them. It&#39;s a game of forgetting we are God. It&#39;s hard for Abrahamic religious people to accept. </p>

<p>&quot;NIST&#39;s entire investigation included no physical evidence.&quot; NIST on WTC7</p>

<p>&quot;Out of 329 core column sections in the fire and impact zones, NIST obtained portions of four.&quot; NIST on the Twin Towers</p>

<p>Most conspiracy theories have a lot of dots that seem to connect very suspiciously lowering the odds consistently of any coincidence.</p>

<p>When you are redpilled and you start to go down the rabbit hole I will admit you do start to believe that the most random of dots start to look connected like a conspiracy and you do have to check yourself from time to time to make sure you are being objective with the evidence shown to you.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve decided to spread information if someone wants to know about it.</p>

<p>People won&#39;t believe or will believe whatever they want and it&#39;s super infuriating to me to try and have a &quot;debate&quot; or &quot;conversation&quot; with people that aren&#39;t open minded enough to realize that, &quot;just because the news (or whatever) said this, doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s true.&quot; </p>

<p>It makes me want to slap them sometimes. The only way I can explain this annoyance is - It&#39;s about on par with arguing with a flat earther (Sorry if you&#39;re a flat earth person) that just says NO to the basic scientific information that is supplied.</p>

<p>So I stopped.</p>

<p>Normally I only talk about this stuff with people that have the same view points as me, or people that want to know what my viewpoints are or <em>why</em> my views are what they are. There is no sense in trying to educate one that <strong>doesn&#39;t want to be educated</strong>.</p>

<p>Everyone is entitled to think or believe whatever they want, I just don&#39;t understand <em>why</em> people care that other people don&#39;t have the same beliefs as them. This is making me want to go on a tangent about religion so I&#39;m going to stop myself.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>These people have no ability to think for themselves. They lack any kind of critical thinking skills. </p>

<p>They have many beliefs about how the world works, while deluding themselves into thinking they have no beliefs. Something like anomalous cognition is an &quot;extraordinary claim&quot; that requires &quot;extraordinary evidence&quot;. Then when you link to papers on the subject there are never enough or not in the &quot;credible&quot; peer reviewed journal of their choice. They may attempt to discredit the works based only on who did the studies. </p>

<p>What is &quot;extraordinary evidence&quot; anyway? That&#39;s simply a phrase to be conveniently used by closed minded believers when they are confronted with ideas that contradict their beliefs. Whenever they encounter something they deem is an &quot;extraordinary claim&quot; they can deny any evidence they are presented because it&#39;s not &quot;extraordinary&quot; enough. </p>

<p>The fact is, the difference between a &quot;standard claim&quot; and an &quot;extraordinary claim&quot; is subjective. It depends on the beliefs of the individual. To these people, something like the existence of black holes is a &quot;standard claim&quot;, but anomalous cognition is &quot;extraordinary&quot;. However, the opposite could be argued since black holes have never been seen or measured and many people have experienced some form of anomalous cognition. Why isn&#39;t the existence of black holes an extraordinary claim?</p>

<p>In the end &quot;extraordinary claim&quot; is nothing more than a buzzword for pseudo intellectuals to arbitrarily deny anything that doesn&#39;t fit their worldview.</p>

<p>Your post, and especially the part I quoted above, is semantical bullshit.</p>

<p>Just because we lump it all together as &quot;conspiracies&quot; or &quot;conspiracy theories&quot; and discuss it in a sub set up for conspiracy theories does not mean that we are not talking about facts or a true factual conspiracy.</p>
