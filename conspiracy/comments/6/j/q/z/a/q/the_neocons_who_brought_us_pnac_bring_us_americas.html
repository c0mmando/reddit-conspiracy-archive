<p>This is a document from the Institute for the Study of War.</p>

<p>It contains some valuable information about what the neoconservative faction are concerned about. </p>

<p>Plan to invade Iran...check.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A major US-Iran conflict is likely in the next five years. Iran has developed a functioning, interoperable, and 
deployable  coalition  of  its  proxies  with  Russia’s  help,  which  will  invalidate  US  planning  assumptions.  Iran  seeks<br/>
conventional capabilities as well. It will counter US pressure on nonnuclear issues, resist efforts to control Iraqi 
Popular Mobilization Forces, and escalate in the Persian Gulf, the Red Sea, and elsewhere, using its own forces and 
its proxies.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is a big time crunch for their plans.   There are 2018 elections which worry them significantly.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The US must develop a plan to achieve American interests with limited or no ability to base in Iraq. Iran and Iraqis 
aligned with Tehran are preparing to use the 2018 elections to replace Iraq’s Prime Minister Haider al Abadi with a 
pro-Iranian candidate, who will likely order US and coalition forces out of Iraq or curtail their actions below levels 
required to destroy ISIS and other jihadists.</p>

<p>Implementing a no-fly zone in Syria... check</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The US implements a no-fly zone in Dera’a Province, demonstrating US commitment to addressing the grievances 
of populations under jihadist control and facilitating a local cessation of hostilities with Russia and between pro-
Assad and US-backed anti-Assad forces. The US must also help partner forces in Dera’a destroy ISIS and al Qaeda, 
which would help facilitate a negotiated settlement of the Syrian war. The US should execute this step after the first 
phase and coincident with clearing operations in southeastern Syria.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Oh you see folks, the combating plan for battling Isis is all wrong:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Principles of Current Strategy
The  erroneous  principles  behind  the  current  American<br/>
strategy are:</p>
</blockquote>

<p>• ISIS is the most serious threat to American security; </p>

<p>• ISIS  will  collapse  when  America’s  proxies  have<br/>
retaken Raqqa and Mosul; </p>

<p>• The US should only support allies against ISIS; </p>

<p>• The  US  must  temporarily  align  with  Russia  and<br/>
Iran to defeat ISIS; </p>

<p>• America  must  act  primarily  through  proxies  and<br/>
airstrikes; </p>

<p>• The  US  can  manage  al  Qaeda  in  Syria  through<br/>
targeting its leadership; and </p>

<p>• America can rely on others to solve Iraq’s political 
problems</p>

<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/t8A83oU.png">https://i.imgur.com/t8A83oU.png</a></p>

<p>Russia and Iran are going to bake it more difficult for the American Empire.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Russia and Iran are building a regional 
order  based  on  their  shared  near-term  interests,  which<br/>
will  not  diverge  any  time  soon.
8
  This  developing  system<br/>
denies  America  the  freedom  to  protect  its  own  interests.<br/>
The Russo-Iranian coalition will make it more difficult for 
the US to respond to terror threats against it, defend key 
allies such as Israel, and ensure unfettered access to trade 
routes the US economy depends on. </p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/fRe2zbV.png">https://i.imgur.com/fRe2zbV.png</a></p>

<p>Of course lets get to some recommendations. The US should establish a base in Syria.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There are multiple options for how to execute this concept 
of operations. The first is to seize and secure the entirety of 
Abu Kamal and the nearby airfield. US forces would need 
to seize, secure, and expand the Hamdan Military Airfield 
north of Abu Kamal to turn it into a base of operations. 
US Special Mission Units can conduct an airborne assault 
onto the airfield or establish a nearby lodgment before 
advancing to seize the field by ground movement. The 
US must then build necessary field-expedient facilities to 
support transport fixed- and rotary-wing operations, as 
well as a significant Special Operations Forces presence 
secured by the requisite conventional forces. US forces 
should  consider  using  Osprey-equipped  Marine  units 
during the initial phase to increase the base’s operational 
radius so that it could support Special Mission Units and 
other targeting operations in Iraq’s Anbar and western 
Ninewah, in addition to ISIS-held eastern Syria. The base 
will  ultimately  need  to  support  forward  operating  bases<br/>
(FOBs) along the ERV toward Deir ez Zour and possibly 
into Iraq’s Anbar province.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/EhuEcF1.png">https://i.imgur.com/EhuEcF1.png</a></p>

<p>All these plans of course depend on the following conditions:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Planning Assumptions</p>

<p>For the purposes of this report, a planning assumption is 
an  assumption  that,  if  invalid,  would  negate  the  viability<br/>
of the course of action. The most crucial assumptions are:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Russia  will  not  attempt  to  shoot  down  American<br/>
aircraft.</p></li>
<li><p>US  and  coalition  forces  will  not  be  ejected  rapidly<br/>
from Iraq in a manner that forces a retrograde under 
fire.</p></li>
<li><p>The   US   intervention   in   southeastern   Syria   will<br/>
incentivize  local  Sunni  Arabs  to  accept  American 
training, and they will fight alongside the US against 
ISIS.</p></li>
<li><p>Jordan’s King Abdullah will support the operation.</p></li>
<li><p>The  US  will  not  accept  restrictions  on  US  activities<br/>
as  a  component  of  international  negotiations  for  a<br/>
settlement of the Syrian war.</p></li>
<li><p>Iran will not launch a full regional war against Saudi 
Arabia or Israel.</p></li>
</ol>

<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/vruqdy5.png">https://i.imgur.com/vruqdy5.png</a></p>

<p>If Russia does shoot down a jet, well its world war 3. But these guys a little more optimistic.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Russia  attempts  to  shoot  down  American  aircraft 
in  southeastern  Syria. </p>

<p>The  ISW-CTP  planning  team  assesses  that  a  Russian  escalation  is  least  likely  in  the  terrain southeast of the city of Deir ez Zour because it is not  strategically  critical  for  the  Syrian  regime.  We  have  therefore  assumed  that  Russia  will  not  attempt  to  shoot  down an American aircraft. Nonetheless, it is possible and is dangerous enough to require contingency planning. The  US  must  be  prepared  to  conduct  a  full  suppression  of  enemy  air  defense  if  necessary  and  to  use  alternative  sources of leverage over Putin to deter him from attacking US forces. The US must position a joint package of strike and  air  defense  assets  in  theater  before  beginning  this  course of action to strengthen this deterrence. The package must be obviously able to attain air supremacy throughout the theater and maritime supremacy in the Mediterranean if required.</p>

<p>Russian  forces  in  the  area  cannot  survive  in  the  face  of  a  fully resourced American air campaign. Moreover, Putin cannot  afford  to  replace  the  air  and  sea  assets  he  has deployed  to  the  Middle  East.  The  challenge  to  the  US  is  therefore not fighting the Russians, but rather persuading Putin that we will fight and fully defeat him if necessary to  obtain  freedom  of  action  without  engaging  in  a  direct  military conflict with Russia.</p>

<p>End goal is of course regime change:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Full   regime   change   acceptable   to   all   major<br/>
population subgroups; </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nice post. So, I&#39;m guessing US troops in the Ukraine and US troops stay in Sweden extended to one year after it was just supposed to be a training exercise are the alternative leverage to be used against Putin.</p>

<p>Which means Iran regime change is the goal.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s the PDF for the Washington Institute &quot;White House Transition Papers 2017&quot;.</p>

<p>Very informative and explains specific behaviors by Trump regarding Saudi Arabia.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Between Iran and Israel there is Iraq and Syria. The neocons want to break down Iraq and Syria into smaller states that can barely challenge anything.</p>

<p>After the Syrian government collapses, Israel will re-invade Lebanon after their failed attempt to wipe out Hezbollah in 2006.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, expansion of Israel is certainly a goal, at least complete annexation of the West Bank.   They are engaged in a population transfer. Cause a refugee crisis from neighboring states.... I wonder if they are just making room for a future displacement of Palestinians.   </p>

<p>At least we know what their geographical interest is in Iran.</p>
