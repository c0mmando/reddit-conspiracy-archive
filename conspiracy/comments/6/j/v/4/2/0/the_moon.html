    <div class="md"><p>Launch twice. Play second one backwards for landing. </p>

<p>The landings on the ocean appear to be legitimate landings. Although I timed the decent rate from the cloud ceiling and its impossible to be a rocket the size they say it is. I do not believe they have showed one enter from earth orbit or does this exist?</p>

<p>So Stage 2 is around 160KM when they cut into the Stage 1 descent feed. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBhKH2ajtiY">Notice this one at 1:50 seconds</a></p>

<p>Cloud ceiling in Florida is 9000ft, on a good day (that&#39;s the lowest). This Stage 2 passes through the clouds and lands a second later. Was it going 1/4 mile per second?</p>

<p>Note that at 1:40 the feed cuts out. This is fabricated. It&#39;s absolutely falsifiable with this video. There is no way it descended for 1:40 seconds and then in 5 seconds after the feed cuts it hits the cloud ceiling, then 5 seconds later its on the pad. It&#39;s ridiculous to believe this.</p>

<p>Think about the physics involved too. It&#39;s travelling avg of 1.7 Miles a second, then it stops to zero. And you can barely see the rocket firing to change the speed to 1/4 MPS. There&#39;s no speed change until it touches the pad.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Did you even go through the supposed evidence?</p>

<ol>
<li><p>SELENE photographs - <strong><em>CGI</em></strong> - doesn&#39;t even look the same.</p></li>
<li><p>&quot;the Terrain Mapping Camera of India&#39;s Chandrayaan-1 probe <em>did not have enough resolution to record Apollo hardware</em>.&quot;</p></li>
<li><p><em>&quot;It claims to have spotted traces of the Apollo landings, though the relevant imagery has not been publicly identified.&quot;</em></p></li>
<li><p>Aside from NASA, a number of entities and individuals observed, through various means, the Apollo missions as they took place. <strong>A probe could do the same thing</strong> - why did they send the feed to Aus and record it off a monitor?</p></li>
<li><p>Soviet Union - <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6jv420/the_moon/djhaudw/">See: This post here</a> </p></li>
</ol>

<p>Also research how Russia got it&#39;s &quot;Nukes&quot; (technology) and where they got shipments for raw materials from.</p>

<p>Space is a lie. I don&#39;t mean space doesn&#39;t exist I mean the public was sold a lie about space. It&#39;s a fictional representation. It&#39;s easier to lie to people than convince them they were lied to. And absolutely other countries benefit to the exact same degree, also even if Russia or China or anyone started claiming the US faked the moon, the US would simply call it &quot;Propaganda.&quot;</p>

<p>Essentially humanity &amp; its beliefs move with momentum and pendulum swings. Get enough momentum on any issue and people will fall into place as &quot;experts&quot; and there will be tons of seemingly independent confirmation. Coincidentally anything that contradicts that narrative will end up in the state secrets vault. Contending with a narrative is political suicide and Im sure there are larger forces at play but even from an outside know-nothing perspective it&#39;s easy to see how these things relate to a common belief.</p>

<p>Now consider this: if the government isn&#39;t hiding anything why do they have millions of documents which will never be declassified. Why spend 1 trillion a year on defense - a large % going to classifications and secrecy. </p>

<p>If you do nothing wrong you have nothing to hide....</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lol you&#39;re funny. I never said &quot;the government isn&#39;t hiding anything,&quot; and such an assertion would be nothing but lunacy. To disregard every single photograph, image, video, etc. from space as somehow another perfect manufacture of NASA and some massive worldwide conspiracy to &quot;hoax space&quot; would be equally as insane, the sheer number of personnel required to become lifelong devotees to the lie would obviate the story coming out eventually, not to mention I don&#39;t think some of the images CAN be effectively faked without leaving solid evidence that isn&#39;t explainable by a plausible physical means. Are you insinuating that even the ISS is a hoax mission?</p>

<p>Okay.</p>

<p>With the logic you provided everyone in the company would have to be aware of the sham. Yet, it only takes a few. The rest adhere to the social engineering, hierarchy.</p>

<p>In many many cases, like let&#39;s say 9/11 for example, I&#39;d agree with you wholeheartedly, they can be pulled by a few perps in strategic places. But the moon landings is a different story. Thousands of engineers knew exactly what they were working on, had hands on experience with the technology, worked out the math and science necessary for us to acquire the technology needed to get to the moon. They all believed we did it because they knew it was possible... because they MADE it possible. What reason would they have to doubt, furthermore what reason would there be to fake it if it was possible. Far from something like 9/11 which involves, if any advanced technology at all, something developed in a black box and not advertised to the world upon its exercise.</p>

<p>That fact in tandem with all the live moonwalk videos, which I have seen numerous refutations of, none of them I am convinced by, for me provides the insurmountable evidence. There&#39;s a point where I just have to go &quot;yep, that&#39;s enough evidence.&quot;</p>

<p>Now, I have to say I&#39;m STILL open to the idea that some of the events were hoaxed, like the very first moonwalk maybe, or maybe even just parts of it, but right now I&#39;m on the other side of the fence where I believe it until DISproven fully.</p>

<p>Okay. So that&#39;s suspicious for sure, but leads you to believe they were &quot;staged&quot; why?</p>

<p>I mean it&#39;s an interesting scenario, but it sounds like you yourself are writing the script of a Hollywood movie. I mean, sure let&#39;s say it was to condition them to follow orders. Does that somehow diminish the engineering skills of any of the employees, or their ability to discern whether they were making accomplishments with their work? Why would it mean that?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Early faked footage</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not sure what this is, who made it, what it purports to show, which part of it is fake, nor least of all what relevance it has to NASA in the 1960s allegedly putting men on the moon and broadcasting live footage of the event to the American public. I have literally no clue why you are presenting this information to the debate other than it&#39;s footage of a rocket that looks a bit cheesy and you thought that would add to the array of convergence of evidence against the moon landing. But it doesn&#39;t any more than <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FrdVdKlxUk">this</a>.</p>

<p>Officially the Rockefellers had a hand in Russian politics and business via their &quot;philanthropy&quot;.

<hr/>

<p><a href="http://www.academia.edu/20535160/Giving_and_Taking_across_Borders_The_Rockefeller_Foundation_and_Russia_1919_1928">The Russian case highlights several of these conceptual issues. Rela-tions between Rockefeller and Russia unfolded during the ‘years of silence’, when America and Soviet Russia lacked diplomatic ties.
4</a></p>

<p>Here&#39;s the kicker:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Indicative of this was a strange event which occurred in October of 1964. David Rockefeller, president of the Chase Manhattan Bank and chairman of the board of the Council on Foreign Relations, took a vacation in the Soviet Union.</strong> This is a peculiar place for the world&#39;s greatest &quot;imperialist&quot; to take his vacation since much of Communist propaganda deals with taking all of David&#39;s wealth away from him and distributing it to &quot;the people.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>A few days after Rockefeller ended his &quot;vacation&quot; in the Kremlin, Nikita Khrushchev was recalled from a vacation at a Black Sea resort to learn that he had been fired.</strong> How strange! As far as the world knew, Khrushchev was the absolute dictator of the Soviet government and, more important, head of the Communist Party which runs the USSR. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>So if the US faked the moon landing and I assume the Russian powers knew about it, it&#39;s very possible Kruschev was not happy or willing to agree to it. But whatever powers over him forced him into submission shortly after. </p>

<p>Rumours exist that the actual moon missions happened 5 years or so before the real ones. That after going there it was decided the fake version would be made public instead later in the decade.</p>

<p>Why hasn&#39;t Russia, china, or another country been to the moon?</p>

<p>Russia sent a few rovers up which are still sitting there (Lunokhod&#39;s I and II), supposedly you can see them with a <em>really</em> nice telescope. They also have laser reflects mounted to them that can bounce signals back to Earth if your aim is good enough.</p>

<p>China sent a rover up a couple years ago but it had a dust problem just after it landed, major disappointment.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why don&#39;t they go to the moon to put their flag like America has done? Why haven&#39;t we colonized the moon yet? I know the cost would be ridiculous but what&#39;s actually stopping us or them from doing so?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The thing is that there&#39;s not really much of a reason to. We have decades of identical or similar science experiments we can do in lower Earth orbit at a fraction of the cost. There&#39;s nothing of value up on the Moon that&#39;s worth lifting a rocket up into space to retrieve. Maybe one day we could use it as a staging area for long-range missions...but even then it makes more sense to build a space station instead.</p>

<p>In short, the Moon is just, well, kind of useless in and of itself. It was a nice propaganda victory in the Cold War, but aside from that, it&#39;s really just a barren rock. It&#39;s got some interesting questions around it, but nothing so interesting as to out-prioritize questions we can answer in low Earth orbit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not really sure what you are implying with this question, but I&#39;ll try to answer.</p>

<p>First off, people still climb everest because it is the highest mountain on earth and thus a great achievement. Also, it is actually more expensive to climb everest now than it was then- the difference is, it is significantly less dangerous now. So you are paying for the premium of having pre-roped routes with ladders across crevasses and such, plus a team of highly experienced mountain guides to take you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Im not really sure of what you are implying with your answer.</p>

<p>Flying to the moon completely shits on climbing Mount Everest in terms of accomplishment.</p>

<p>And whilst it is more expensive today as well, surely with the circa 50 years of advanced technology surely it would be much safer than flying to the moon 50 years ago.  </p>

<p>No one went to the moon in a machine with the computing power of my microwave.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How many more ways can I explain it?</p>

<p>It&#39;s ridiculously expensive to go to the moon, most of the money goes into fuel, not scientific instrumentation or anything like that. </p>

<p>If your goal is maximizing your science-per-dollar-spent, that money is better spent in low Earth orbit for now.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re in it for prestige...there&#39;s not much prestige in being #2 to do something, and it&#39;s especially silly to spend a ton of money just to be #2 and not get much else out of it.</p>

<p>People don&#39;t understand just how rich the US was and is compared to other nations. Our budget is <em>huge</em>, not just because of wealth per capita, but also because we&#39;re #3 in terms of population, second only to China and India.</p>

<p>You tell me <strong>why</strong> anyone should care to go to the Moon when:</p>

<p>A) It is expensive as fuck</p>

<p>B) You can only at best be #2</p>

<p>C) There is still a list a mile long of fresh, new, innovative science that can be done in orbit for a fraction of the cost</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I like your analogy, and I agree that the cost of going to the moon is very high compared to the potential gains (that we know of anyway). Hopefully we are nearing the point where this kind of travel will be more affordable as new technologies are invented, like SpaceX&#39;s Falcon rockets.</p>

<p>As for your other point, I see what you mean, but it still does not make sense that no one has even attempted to leave low earth orbit with a manned mission. Other countries who may be behind the US in the space race would stand to benefit from achieving something that hasn&#39;t been done in over 40 years, in order to prove themselves as a world player in the space race (like China, India, Mexico, etc.) Technology and rocket efficiency has significantly improved since the Apollo missions, yet not one country or organization has enough money to even attempt leaving low earth orbit just once? America was able to do it 7 TIMES! If it was so expensive that no one since has been able to afford it, then how were we able to afford going that many times? We even started bringing collapsible transforming Moon-buggys! </p>

<blockquote>
<p>What pushed humans to the moon wasn&#39;t the science, it was the Cold War propaganda victory. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s exactly what I think the whole thing was, a Cold War propaganda victory. They faked going to the moon, and instead used that massive budget for god knows what (same place the money from the Star Wars Defense System boondoggle went I imagine). And why would the Russians just completely give up after that if they were already so close to doing it? Especially during the Cold War, where both sides were extremely paranoid about the other&#39;s weapons capabilities like with the whole Sputnik thing. Wouldn&#39;t they want to make sure that we weren&#39;t putting nukes on the moon that could be launched at them undetected?</p>

<p>Bear in mind, I&#39;m not trying to say that this is 100% fact, this is just my belief based on what I&#39;ve seen and read over the years. I appreciate your counterarguments, as I enjoy having my beliefs challenged.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes it did, according to NASA. Not sure what that other guy is saying. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve always flirted with the theory that the moon is an artificially constructed object which was placed there in order to originally terraform the Earth. We know it influences things like the tide, but it could be serving other purposes that we can&#39;t even fathom yet. Who or what put it there, is then the real question.</p>

<p>Aside from the potential of a hollow core, the most intriguing aspects to support this theory are </p>

<p>A. the moon&#39;s orbit and rotation, which have multiple irregularities from most other satellites (like the fact that it rotates at the prefect speed to only ever reveal one side to earth). The wiki is pretty interesting <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit_of_the_Moon">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit_of_the_Moon</a></p>

<p>And B. It&#39;s distance from earth is very close to appearing as the exact same size as the sun when viewed from earth. This is why only a small portion of the world are able to witness a total solar eclipse when they happen.</p>

<p>Just some food for thought.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it&#39;s entirely possible they went to the moon, just not with the listed technology or operations they claimed to do it with. It makes much more sense from a strategical standpoint as well. If you go but cannot disclose the technology, method, or &quot;help&quot; (whichever it may be) you fake a low tech version that people hold arrogantly. Should anyone catch wind of the real operation Black Propaganda that it was faked is released. Instead of the real OP being discussed it becomes a Fake vs Real argument with no in between or logical discussion on the who, how, why, when, etc.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The video includes multiple instances of talking heads, not necessarily from NASA, saying basically this. Here is a quote from NASA that is specifically talking about interstellar radiation, yet this would have also been a show-stopper for any moon mission. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>“NASA’s focus now is on sending humans beyond low-Earth orbit to Mars… We are trying to develop the technologies to get there, it is actually a huge technological challenge. There are a couple of really big issues. For one thing – Radiation. Once you get outside the Earth’s magnetic field we are going to be exposing the astronauts to not just radiation coming from the Sun, but also to cosmic radiation. That&#39;s a higher dose than we think humans right now should really get.”</p>

<p>That&#39;s not saying we&#39;ve never been beyond it.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>This region being previously impassable <em>zones</em> of the belts. That&#39;s not a statement claiming we have never passed through the belts, nor is it claiming we have never gone beyond low Earth orbit.</p>

<p>&quot;The Apollo missions marked the first event where humans traveled through the Van Allen belts, which was one of several radiation hazards known by mission planners.[31] The astronauts had low exposure in the Van Allen belts due to the short period of time spent flying through them. Apollo flight trajectories bypassed the inner belts completely, and only passed through the thinner areas of the outer belts.&quot;</p>

<p>With current craft. We don&#39;t currently have active craft specifically for low earth orbit. That&#39;s different than claiming we never have gone beyond it.</p>

<p>Actually none of your quotes claim we never have gone beyond low earth orbit, just that the Orion craft will allow us to do so again.</p>

<p>Also, this stupid video claims we filmed landings from the moon&#39;s surface. LOL.</p>

<p>nasa scientists have repeatedly said, yes there is a belt of radiation, but think about it, density, it&#39;s not thick the same everywhere, you have patches of more and less dense radiation if that&#39;s acceptable terminology</p>

<p>and secondly, it&#39;s not like it spans all the way to jupiter, it&#39;s a small belt, small in the terms of astro distances, not down the road to your local chemist</p>

<p>When JFK announced in 1961 that America would land on the moon he was blissfully unaware of Van Allen and interstellar radiation and had no idea what he was signing the nation&#39;s space program up for. Well, the space program was really only ever a sort of entertainment Branch of Central Intelligence. They faked the entire Apollo program and the space fakery has not stopped. </p>

<p>Yes, I second the recommendation someone else made about Wagging the Moondoggie. Read it. It&#39;s free online. </p>

<p>The idea that &quot;there&#39;s no reason to go to the moon&quot; for any other country is the most idiotic concept anyone could ever try to tell you and one that I can easily refute multiple times over. </p>

<p>Here&#39;s a discussion I also wholeheartedly recommend that would answer some of your good questions and leave no doubt that Apollo was an elaborate hoax. </p>

<p>What your arguing, against the mountains of publicly available evidence and information, is that people are still faking missions (not to mention the laser responses) for no other reason than to keep backing up a 50 year old story. Instead of keeping it closed in they are now expanding the fraud to include other countries who are faking launches, radar information, equipment and more just to keep up the ruse.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The moon is semi transparent. I will link some stuff about the moon if anyone is interested in how the moon is in actuality an astral body. Everything in what we call outer space is a light body in the astral plane.</p>

<p>The sun, moon, stars. There are other types of astral bodies you can&#39;t see because they don&#39;t necessarily light up within our perception. Nonetheless they still emit a different type of light within a different spectrum.</p>

<p>First of all space is not what NASA fakes it as. They create a totally false paradigm and everyone buys it. Well not everyone, I don&#39;t. And I have researched enough about consciousness to know there are different areas of consciousness, and what NASA tells you is space, is actually one of those areas. That area is known as the Astral Plane. The density is different as the density materializes as almost no density at all. </p>

<p>So the moon, is essentially a light body. Though it&#39;s also a creation within the environment it resides in. Some being, or groups of beings with a reality within the astral plane has made the moon. And on a lighter density than we currently perceive ,they are using it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He is right. Unfortunately you don&#39;t see that yet. Also he was saying you can barely see planes so how do you see satellites that are farther up? I highly doubt you can see satellites, first of all they are supposedly traveling at 17000 mph. So no, you don&#39;t see them. So are you talking about?</p>

<p>You most likely saw flat earth and your bias kicked in.</p>

<p>&quot;The light moving around the moon was pretty cool&quot; </p>

<p>Anyway, back to planes and satellites. Welp if I can&#39;t see satellites what am I seeing when I see planes?  He says in the video people can&#39;t see planes.  Also, why are satellites and flat earth mutually exclusive?  So many things I don&#39;t understand. Also, what do the astral bodies moving across the moon have to do with the shape of the earth?

    <div class="md"><p>Actually you engaged me for info and then didn&#39;t make any sense after that so I think you are curious and questioning things so I have no problem with it. I will gladly call you dumb too. People need it. They are fucking duuuuuumb. :p don&#39;t be so uptight you know it&#39;s true. I was one of them. I was fucking duuumb. </p>

<p>Ok , let me explain the vid. There are other astral bodies eclipsing the moon. There is actually a legend about it called Raku and Ketu</p>

<p>In Hindu tradition, Rahu ( ) is the severed head of an asura called Svarbhānu, that swallows the sun causing eclipses. He is depicted in art as a serpent with no body riding a chariot drawn by eight black horses. Rahu is one of the navagraha (nine planets) in Vedic astrology and is paired with Ketu.</p>

<p>Now that aside, what are we looking at? The video clearly, to best a camera can record this, it captures this legend in action. It was there, you saw it. Let go of your bias and conditioned perception. There is clearly something eclipsing the moon and it&#39;s not the earth. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ever day dream? It&#39;s not that fucking hard. :p I mean really, it&#39;s not that complex of an idea. You dream every night ,where do you go? Connect these dots...Night, sleep, dreams, &#39;space&#39; are all interconnected. Think about it. We each have a personal relationship with each area of consciousness and it&#39;s not really hidden inside.</p>

<p>We are each in area 1 now. Dense Waking reality. Waking is also connected to the dream state, area 2, or the astral area of consciousness. </p>

<p>Though, through their efforts it has been extremely separated. This is the reason for the fake space is to artificially separate the consciousness of waking and dreaming. Because the knowledge of their connection Is quite powerful and wouldn&#39;t be controllable, like they want. They actually use the astral in ways that are highly symbolic in nature and with a type of forced prediction that is difficult to explain in one post.</p>

<p>But again, it is a simple perception that our consciousness is reflected into our world. We dream, we go to the astral, this is what space is a reflection of. Our world reflects our consciousness.</p>

<p>As for controlling the astral body , or being more in control of the astral experience. You have to understand that your being while awake and dense ,and your being while asleep and light are in fact overlapped. Or in other words you are a dense version of a dream body.</p>

<p>So is practically everything in space to some extent. Only in the astral our area 1 is too dense. So man-made satellites are not in the astral plane as a physical dense object. Nothing we are sending to space is an astral body, therefore nothing goes to space. Density more or less is the next level down from the astral. Hope that is clear.</p>
