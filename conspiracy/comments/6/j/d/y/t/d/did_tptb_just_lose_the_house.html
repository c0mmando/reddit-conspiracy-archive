       The house has always been close. True liberals and true conservatives really are out there. Add to that the harm it's doing to the EU. Doesn't necessarily mean we have a fully functioning republic. Perhaps just a splintering of TPTB. Either case is desirable.

       Why exactly don't we want the sanctions that the Senate almost unanimously supports against Russia, as Russia invaded, annexed, and started a civil war in Europe?
      </p>
      <p>
       And before "why do you want to start WW3" as the expected response, please realize that sanctions are meaning you can't do business with certain people and industries, it isn't a war.

       Because that narrative is fake and wrong and provided to you by the CIA that simply wants to protect its $700 billion a year budget, so it manufactures war all over the world even though our military is more
powerful than the next 8 countries combined.

       The article you linked says 6.5 trillion. Which is still an unthinkably enormous amount of taxpayer money that there is no accounting for. Literally theft on the grandest scale.

       I figured it was an honest mistake. I'm sure you are aware that just before the September 11, 2001 attacks, Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld admitted the DOD could not account for 3 trillion dollars in a similar situation. I believe it was September 10, 2001. Odd, no?

       The media has misrepresented what went down in Ukraine, who plotted it, who instigated it, and why.
      </p>
      <p>
       It wasn't a "civil war", it was a coup planned and instigated by the US and other Western spook agencies. We know this because a conversation between Victorian Nuland, Spokesperson for the United States Department of State, and U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, Geoffrey Pyatt was recorded and leaked to the press.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the conversation, they discussed WHO was going to be in charge AFTER the coup - and the conversation took place ~January 28, 2013 -
       <strong>
        <em>
         fully three weeks before
        </em>
       </strong>
       the "demonstrations" erupted that would eventually lead to the ousting of the democratically elected government and the installation of Western-backed stooges.
      </p>

        Please note that the following BBC article was PUBLISHED 11 days BEFORE the "demonstrations" erupted:

       </a>
       - 7 February 2014
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, the entire event was instigated by agents of the US, EU nations and the MOSSAD - and though there were many motives, one of the plotters primary goals was to force Putin to ignore SYRIA by keeping him busy dealing with the Ukraine/ Crimea crisis.

       Interesting thought. It is important to remember that although our government has become a tool of the elite, it is not entirely controlled by them. The House of Representatives is the citizenry's best chance at thwarting the agenda of the powerful. However, I expect that anytime this comes close to happening there will be some event or crisis that allows circumvention or diversion of the will of the people.
