       This is so false. Trans has been openly discussed in the west for the last 25-30 years maybe more. Don't make up stuff. We've had plenty a celebrity bring it to the forefront time and time again going back to the 70's really.

       Name one celebrity before Chris Jenner who had a sex change. Also acceptance of it and talking about it are two seperate things.

       It's not a matter of that. It's that because of acceptance a celebrity was able to come out and do what they felt they needed in thier life without fear of persecution. Which again is why you see people who are transgendered  more predominantly in your every day life.

       Ah yes Bruce now Caitlyn sorry I don't keep up with this stuff. And yes they did thank you back in 2012 I looked it up. Still goes with the times of acceptance rather than persecution also both of them are millionaires so what do they care what people think but still it isn't a taboo to where they would lose everything. The wachowskis are successful directors you think back in the day if they did this they would still be directors?

       Everything the Wachowskis did for 20 years is part of the Illuminati blueprint. Matrix and then the transgender BS(unification of both sexes). I don't believe in such coincidences at that level.

       The internet (as well as increased technological proficiency in youth) has allowed environments to exist that support transgenders and enforce the idea. Im sure the number itself isn't increasing significantly, but the number of people who feel comfortable in identifying themselves that way publicly definitely has.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not trying to say that I believe transgenderism is manufactured, but places like Tumblr for example are very quick to accept and support people who either identify or show traits of possibly being transgender. There was a good post on the front page in this sub about this the other day

       There's 2 important conspiracies to consider. (This isn't meant to shame transsexual people --- I couldn't think of a more difficult path to have to walk.)

       <li>
        "They turned our frogs gay" --- Alex Jones
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       Up until a few years ago, the additives in our plastics, particularly the plastic that lining our tin cans like soup, beans, pasta ect. contained a chemical that no, lie, in testing, turned the male frogs female. So there's that.
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        Female Contraceptions --- "the Pill" (this is just a rough explanation) tricks a women's body into thinking she is already pregnant. Now when when women pee, that pee, with all these jumped up female hormones, eventually make it into our water supply. Filtration or not.

       Any evidence the pill gets into the water supply in sufficient amounts to affect anything? Because I really doubt that it would be in anywhere near enough concentrations

       If it gets through and isn't filtered out of the water properly, that means that all animals and humans will be getting contaminated from these hormones. Just need to see the connection to males eating too many eggs and developing breasts to see that female hormones do affect males in high concentration. Who knows what happens at a lower concentration but it is happening and I suppose we'll find out in a couple of generations how severe it is. Feminised males = reduced population.

       WTF you on about? If hormone replacement therapy is used during a transexuals transition from one sex to the other, and if things like this could happen 'unintentionally' it is still the same fucking thing and does relate to the OP. What game are you trying to play here... First sticking up for the British political structure and now sticking up for people unknowingly ingesting excess / opposite hormones. There's something about you...

       No. I'm not defending that.  I'm saying I haven't seen evidence of accidental transition and it wouldn't make you transgender if you psychologically don't believe you are. (Especially since if you read the post you'll see how there has Been a 'recent increase')

       You think democracy in Britain is fine the way it is, power with the population... Yawn.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hormones play a bigger role in sex / gender that what you are making out. Testestorone comes from the testes. You know, the sexual organ. Hormones are directly linked to gender so no matter if it is intentional or unintentional that hormones are in the body, it's still going to cause transgenderism due to having an abundance of the opposite sex's hormones. Wither the person thinks one way or another is irrelevant, the hormones will be taking affect.

       During our last conversation, you agreed it was a good system... Funny that you've changed your tune since then...

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Women synthesize most of their estrogen in their ovaries and other reproductive tissues. Since men lack this female anatomy, they need to produce estrogen through a process involving an enzyme called aromatase that transforms testosterone into estradiol.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Mem don't have or produce estrogen. How long as the pill been a viable contraception? There 'could' be an upsurge in transgenderism since there is more women taking the pill since men are taking in hormones that they do not have.

       I'm not the one that's lying here. I even said to you about if the world was governed the way the UK is, China would have the control of the world but you still thought the UK was a good democratic system lol
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm no scientist so I'm speculating although there does seem to be reports out there suggesting the same thing. Who knows what would happen with an abundance of estrogen in women. Even more reactive? lol Turn them gay / bisexual? Who knows, just postulating, but it is a worry having hormones not being filtrated out the water systems.

       It's the latest fad, a craze, pushed by the media.  Easily impressionable, attention-seeking idiots are buying into it hook, line, and sinker for all those delicious social brownie points.

       I get the impression that at least some transgenders, especially those who search for praise and attention consider themselves such based on preexisting gender stereotypes. Let's say you get born with a male body but your life experience teaches you that you do not fit into the classic manly expectation of character. Somehow these people conclude that therefore they can't be true men. The correct assumption would be that the existing stereotypes are stupid.
      </p>
      <p>
       On expects a "true" man to be hard, he does not cry, he takes charge, etc. But few men are naturally like that, many just act like they are because their minds are enslaved. From childhood they learned that this is how a real man acts and try to imitate it. In this case the transgender identity would be an attempt to resist the mental slavery, but while the intent might be pure, the method is not.
      </p>
      <p>
       Doing so does nothing to abolish stereotypical thinking. The contrary is true. If all "unmanly" men started to consider themselves women it would pressure other unmanly men to denounce their menhood, thereby enforcing the stereotypes. Men who do not fit the stereotype should not renounce their malehood, they should accept it in a effort to be the living embodyment of the truth that preexisting stereotypes are stupid.

       I try to be peaceful and honest and those are the attributes I use to judge others. A peaceful and honest woman has more in common with me than a violent and dishonest man. A peaceful and honest muslim has more in common with me than a violent christian. A honest black guy has more in common with me than a dishonest white guy. An honest child or an honest senior is more similar to me than a dishonest millenial. I prefer honest an dwarf over honest people of normal height, honest fat people over dishonest thin people. Honest ugly people over dishonest beauties. There a rich and poor people who are honest and middle classers who are not.
      </p>
      <p>
       Honesty, Truth, Virtue and the desire for peace are most important in me and everyone who shares these beliefs from a position of understanding and 100% voluntarily is a person I would consider my kind, no matter their lot in the gene lottery.

       There are a lot of things that could contribute to this.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I'll will focus on the political/ideological side of the question.
      </p>
      <p>
       Marxism teaches that the family is the base of the capitalist structure.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, as logical conclusion, if you destroy the base, the whole structure falls.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thus, during the propaganda phase of the implementation of the regime, all things that could lead to the decay of the family unity, are to be nourished. Anything that can be used to harm and/or deconstruct the family, will be used as tool to dismantle the System.
      </p>
      <p>
       In this specific case, the whole rise of the transgenderism is being weaponized by politics.
      </p>
      <p>
       We are almost reaching a point where everything is considered family. And guess what: If everything is purple, nothing is purple, because how can you tell something is purple without the contrast of yellow, for example.
      </p>
      <p>
       Did you see the Batman: Lego film? In the closing credits they chant "friends are family". That's how deep it goes..it's everywhere..

       Wrong,  I repeatedly said I didn't think it was good. Lets not lie.

       'Could', well there's no evidence you've provided. Surely you need to look at the growth in acceptance for having more people being comfortable? And what about female- male?
