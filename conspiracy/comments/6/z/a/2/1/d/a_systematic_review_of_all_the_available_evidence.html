<li><p>&quot;Reproducibility in science is not very sexy. Because our scientific culture generally rewards innovation over cautiousness, replicating a study conducted by others will not get a researcher a publication in a high-end journal, a splashy headline in a newspaper, or a large funding grant from the government. Only an estimated <a href="http://sitn.hms.harvard.edu/flash/2015/reproduce-or-bust-bringing-reproducibility-back-to-center-stage/">0.15% of all published results are direct replications of previous studies.</a>&quot;</p></li>

<li><p>Richard Horton, editor in chief of The Lancet, recently wrote: <a href="http://www.thelancet.com/pdfs/journals/lancet/PIIS0140-6736%2815%2960696-1.pdf">“Much of the scientific literature, perhaps half, may simply be untrue. Afflicted by studies with small sample sizes, tiny effects, invalid exploratory analyses, and flagrant conflicts of interest, together with an obsession for pursuing fashionable trends of dubious importance, science has taken a turn towards darkness. As one participant put it, “poor methods get results”.</a></p></li>
<li><p>In 2009, Dr. Marcia Angell of the New England Journal of Medicine wrote: <a href="http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2009/jan/15/drug-companies-doctorsa-story-of-corruption/">“It is simply no longer possible to believe much of the clinical research that is published, or to rely on the judgment of trusted physicians or authoritative medical guidelines. I take no pleasure in this conclusion, which I reached slowly and reluctantly over my two decades as an editor of The New England Journal of Medicine.”</a></p></li>
<li><p>&quot;I can&#39;t tell you exactly what percentage of the trials are flawed, but I think the problem is far bigger than you imagine, and getting worse...it is so easy to manipulate data, conceal it or fabricate it...there is almost a code of silence not to speak about it.&quot; -<a href="http://www.spiegel.de/international/zeitgeist/spiegel-interview-with-whistleblower-doctor-peter-wilmshurst-a-1052159.html">Whistleblower Dr. Peter Wilmshurst</a></p></li>

<li><p>Nature: More than 70% of researchers have tried and failed to reproduce another scientist&#39;s experiments, and more than half have failed to reproduce their own experiments. <a href="http://www.nature.com/news/1-500-scientists-lift-the-lid-on-reproducibility-1.19970?WT.mc_id=TWT_NatureNews">40 percent of scientists admit that fraud always or often contributes to irreproducible findings.</a> </p></li>
<li><p>&quot;The neuroscientific community needs to challenge the current scientific model driven by dysfunctional research practices tacitly encouraged by the <a href="http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2015-09/aof-rnw092515.php">&#39;publish or perish&#39; doctrine, which is precisely leading to the low reliability and the high discrepancy of results.&quot;</a></p></li>
<li><p>Estimating the reproducibility of psychological science <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/content/349/6251/aac4716.abstract">(Ninety-seven percent of original studies had significant results (P &lt; .05). Thirty-six percent of replications had significant results)</a>  </p></li>
<li><p>Back in the 1960s, a sugar industry executive wrote fat checks to a group of Harvard researchers so that they’d downplay the links between sugar and heart disease in a prominent medical journal—and the researchers did it, according to historical documents reported in the journal JAMA Internal Medicine. One of those Harvard researchers went on to become the head of nutrition at the United States Department of Agriculture, where he set the stage for the federal government’s current dietary guidelines. <a href="http://arstechnica.com/science/2016/09/sugar-industry-bought-off-scientists-skewed-dietary-guidelines-for-decades/">All in all, the corrupted researchers and skewed scientific literature successfully helped draw attention away from the health risks of sweets and shift the blame solely to fats—for nearly five decades. The low-fat, high-sugar diets that health experts subsequently encouraged are now seen as a main driver of the current obesity epidemic.</a> </p></li>

She has a science degree and is worse than a Christian on this shit: how could a group of people who literally don&#39;t know everything ever be wrong? If you do not know the causal reasons then you are always just speculating. And guess what there is a LOT science does not know, and the faculties and paradigm within which they work could are mostly materialist, any non chimical or physical explanation isn&#39;t even worth investigating to them more often than not. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe Peer Review, like all human faculties, can indeed fall victim to our bias&#39; but I don&#39;t think we should abandon it. The more people look at, repeat, and criticize all discoveries and history is essential to bettering our study of it. We need to improve the method, bring in more observation, accountability, reviewers. And we need a cultural change in publishing/grant funding to support more studies into previous ones, and testing of experiments and previously found data. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>We&#39;re going to have to change the culture, which is way more easily said than done. People have to be willing to accept refutations of previous data and really, we need to <em>test</em> it. From my understanding, a big part of the problem is that after their first Peer Review, many papers in fields like Clinical Psychology go untested for years. We need to get the Public to demand that more Grant money, Federal and Private, also be given to examinations of previous experiments in all fields- that&#39;s actual science. </p>
