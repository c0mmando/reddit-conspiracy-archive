On 8/31, I warned 9/2 might be action day that a Korea war would follow. On 9/3, North Korea detonated a hydrogen bomb. If Trump reacted with &quot;fire and fury&quot; he promised, then my predict would have become true. </p>

<ol>
<li>The September plot (8/27/2017)</li>
</ol>

<p>The Feds end the August plot, to continue it with September plot. My wife is arranged a trip to Canada from 9/2 to 9/9. </p>

<p>A week ago, my wife said she wanted to find a suit case in garage for trip.  My wife rarely go to garage. She always buys a new case and left the used one in garage.  It&#39;s unusual that she wants old one. I helped her. When we reached the bottom and she still couldn&#39;t find the case she wanted, I realize it was something didn&#39;t exist. She was doing a search job for the Feds - that&#39;s why the Feds tried to damage the garage door for an unreasonable search. I left her alone. </p>

<p>Next day, I saw her taking a case away. I thought it was to the Feds for examination. I think something will take place in early September. It&#39;s easy to plant when someone is in trip or to create an accident when victim is in travel.  </p>

<p>A framed case will happen on September 2. </p>

<ol>
<li>September 2nd is action date (8/31/2017)</li>
</ol>

<p>Why the Feds abandoned the planed &quot;Hurricane Harvey&quot; and &quot;Charlottesville racial riot&quot;? Because they focus on murdering Kat Sung. 9/2 plan is a one they think can certainly killing me. </p>

<p>In murder case, They used to perform action on Friday. Jail won&#39;t release detainee on bail in week- ends. So the Feds have two days(Saturday and Sunday) to do the killing. I have no income, I have no available working phone. If I were arrested when my wife was absent, nobody would have known that I was in prison. This time my wife travels to Canada from 9/2 to 9/9. The Feds could have seven days to do a &quot;suicide&quot; death. </p>

<p>What will be big event used to distract public&#39;s attention? I think it is war in Korea Peninsula. </p>

<li>See how big the bubble is (1/25/2017)</li>
</ol>

<p>17 years ago, I found the Feds moved the area residents away and bought in houses in large scale. (see #733, 734, 736. CASH FOR HOUSE). As early as 2003, I warned of a housing bubble. (see #180. Beware of housing bubble (11/16/03))That bubble keeps growing up until now. I think that&#39;s because They failed to eliminate Kat Sung. The result is: San Jose becomes No.1 highest median house price city (where I live) and San Franciso is the No.2. (Where my mother and sisters live).</p>

<p>Here is a chart of median home sale prices of San Francisco. The curve is accordant to the persecution course the Feds apply on me. The unusual upward price started from 1993. Though the chart author thought there were two bubbles, it is still a big one in fact. The bubble stopped growing up in 2008 due to financial tsunami but the Feds managed to prevent it from breaking. The down turn was mild. Even in lowest point of 2011, it&#39;s 695,000. Double the amount of starting price.</p>

<p>Image: <a href="http://wolfstreet.com/wp-conte...015-05.png">http://wolfstreet.com/wp-conte...015-05.png</a></p>

<p>From steep curve you may see how big this bubble is.</p>

<p>Report: San Jose, Not San Francisco, Has Highest Median Home Price In Country
BY JACK MORSE IN NEWS ON AUG 12, 2016</p>

<p>San Jose, with a median home price of $1,085,000, currently ranks as the most expensive metropolitan area for would-be home owners. The second most expensive? That would be San Francisco coming in at $885,600.</p>

<ol>
<li>The 2017 bubble(2/1/2017)</li>
</ol>

<p>It was the popping up of the housing bubble that caused the financial tsunami in 2008. The bubble hasn&#39;t been cleaned up completely. The real estate loan were lent from banks. No big bank collapsed. They were bailed out by government with tax-payers&#39; money. The banks still held large quantity of foreclosed houses. Then we saw Federal Reserve&#39;s Quantitative easy programme. That money took over the foreclosed houses for a larger bubble. QE3, where the central bank had spent close to $40 billion per month in mortgage-backed securities. So much money injected into real estate&#39;s area, that&#39;s why I said there is only one bubble - the 2007 one hasn&#39;t been cleaned up and the residue has been extended to a even bigger one - I call it 2017 bubble.</p>

<p>A bubble needs money to keep it to inflating. Federal Reserve had spent nearly four trillion to blow up such a big real estate balloon. It seems they don&#39;t want to pour money into that hole any more. So a crook is pushed out to take that responsibility.</p>

<p>I say 2017 bubble because: 1. Federal Reserve said it likely will increase interest twice this year - that will pop up the housing bubble.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The unprecedented 2016 election in US that put an unqualified man on president seat. I said something big will happen that nobody (party) want to take the responsibility. (see &quot;902. Trump&#39;s job (2) (5/7/2016)&quot;)</p></li>
<li><p>Something big (other then the coming economic crisis) will take place in Europe: War; natural disaster; terror attack.... to distract people from that economic crisis, and drive the money in Europe to US to take over the bubble too. It relates to Russian. I believe Putin is bribed by the Feds to cooperate on this. Trump&#39;s Russian love is not a coincidence.</p></li>

<p>nline whistle blower WikiLeaks unveiled a new batch of compromising materials. This time correspondence of American diplomats was leaked, which clearly shows that the U.S. did not stop its subversive activities against other countries. The published papers can also adversely affect the relationship between certain countries. The main question is who benefits from it.
On November 28 online whistle blower WikiLeaks unveiled another portion of compromising materials. While earlier the website published documents about the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, this time they made public secret correspondence of American diplomats. Most materials relate to the period of 2004 - 2010.</p>

<p>Most of them are recordings of conversations of American diplomats with foreign politicians, officials and individuals in different countries, as well as reports about the events in different countries and analysis of the situation. According to Der Spiegel, these documents are interesting precisely because diplomats and politicians did not expect them to be published and openly expressed their opinions. The psychological characteristics of foreign leaders devised by American diplomats are particularly of interest.</p>

<p>Russia Today: WikiLeaks expose the trust deficciency of US diplomacy</p>

<p>For example, Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad is compared to Hitler in U.S. diplomatic files, while German Chancellor Angela Merkel is called &quot;risk averse and rarely creative.&quot; French President Nicolas Sarkozy was nicknamed &quot;the emperor with no clothes.&quot;</p>

<p>0
SharePrint version Font Size Send to friend Diplomats talked of Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi as &quot;physically and politically weak&quot; and &quot;feckless.&quot; He is particularly disliked by the American diplomats for his friendship with Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.</p>

<p>In turn, the latter is called by American diplomats the &quot;alpha male,&quot; &quot;Batman&quot; and &quot;brutal politician.&quot; Dmitry Medvedev, in contrast, is called &quot;pale and hesitant&#39;&#39; &#39;&#39;who plays Robin to his strongman Prime Minister Vladimir Putin&#39;s &#39;&#39;Batman.&#39;&#39;</p>

<p>However, the greatest harm to the United States could be caused by making public methods of work of the American diplomats. Judging by the documents available in open access on WikiLeaks, Washington spied on UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon, as well as the representatives of this international organization in Russia, China and other countries. Allegedly, the secretary of state Hillary Clinton gave an executive order to do so in July 2009.</p>

<p>he third housing babble (10/1/2012)</p>

<p>This was what happened in 1990s. The Feds started to buy in the real estate property from 1990 when they drove down the housing price. In 1997, when they found I trying to buy a house, the Feds passed the “Taxpayer Relief Act” to check other buyers from competition. Then they pushed up the housing market with the “dot com” babble. Why? Because the area where I live is the Silicone Valley where the high tech. companies gather in and where the Feds hold a lot of property they bought in my case. The tactic was to encourage the establishment of new company. The high salary employee would boost the property price. </p>

<p>The “dot com” babble exploded in 2000. The Feds might have made good profit in property market in elsewhere but the San Francisco Bay Area where they invested heavily in my case. How to release their wealth? Then came the second babble. </p>

<p>In April 2001, Pentagon created EP-3 spy plane collision incident in South China Sea. In secret deal with China to release the spy plane crew, the Feds bribed China to frame a drug case in US. As a payback to Pentagon, the Feds helped Pentagon prepared 911 terror case. Silverstein leased WTC at that month. 911 also gave the Feds the Patriot Act they have longed for. (See: “695. The collusion of D.O.D. and D.O.J. (11/28/2011)”)</p>

<p>With Patriot Act and a framed drug case in hand, the Feds now was sure Kat Sung would be eliminated. What needed was a booming housing market. How to get it? By manipulate the Federal Reserve. </p>

<p>You can see how dramatically the interest rate dropped to the bottom in 2001 that created a housing babble US ever had which finally caused financial collapsing in 2008. </p>

<p>However, the property the Feds hold in Kat Sung’s case is still there, how to deliver the hot potato into other people’s hands? It’s still the mission of Federal Reserve. 
Reuters – Wed, Sep 26, 2012.. .</p>

<p>(Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Reserve launched a new round of monetary stimulus this month, saying it will buy $40 billion in housing-backed bonds each month until the labor market improves substantially.</p>

<p>The Fed has kept interest rates near zero since December 2008 and now says it expects weak economic conditions will warrant keeping them there through at least mid 2015, half a year longer than it had earlier expected.</p>

<p><a href="http://news.yahoo.com/factbox-fed-of...-business.html">http://news.yahoo.com/factbox-fed-of...-business.html</a>
When Federal Reserve exhausted their interest rate tool, to help the Feds to break away from their straits, Federal Reserve will turn papers into money by printing 40 billion dollars each month – all of them will poured into the real estate market in order to create a third housing babble. This time, the babble will come with severe inflation, I foresee.</p>

<p>HOLY SHIT IT REAL How Feds murder people
By kathaksung</p>

<p>My American nightmare</p>

<p>New high tech weapons such like radiation material, microwave kill people without trace, leaving death look like heart attack, blood cancer, etc.</p>

<p>In 1991, because an acquaintance was arrested for drug smuggling, I was under surveillance by law enforcement agent. They used isotope money as tracer which hurt my health badly. After I complained this I found I was frequently under microwave radiation which cooked my blood, solidified them to form clog, caused severe chest pain. As pressure intensified,I could not bear the torture of EM wave, I went abroad in 1999. There I still was under surveillance of local police. On Mar. 22 2000, attempts of frame me up to a drug case forced me seeking political asylum in Thailand.</p>

<p>What made an U.S. citizen drift abroad and ask for political asylum? The black box practice covered criminal activities of U.S. law enforcement agency. New high tech weapons enable them to murder people without being aware of. To prevent U.S. become a fascist country, an independent organization which can check the conduct of law enforcement agency is necessary.</p>

<p>It was a big case ten years ago.</p>

<p>I was a seller in San Jose Berryessa Flea Market. I sell porcelain figuring. On Sept. 1990, a lady, named Mrs. Chen, came to my stand, saying that she was an importer of porcelain. I bought some merchandise from her because she offered a good price.</p>

<p>On June. 1991, Mrs. Chen was arrested for drug smuggling. The newspaper titled: &quot; Heroin bust called U.S. record&quot;.(See San Jose Mercury, 6-21-1991). There was a lot of harassment since then. I was followed, bugged, business turned downward, etc..  <a href="http://www.unforumzed.com/showthread.php?910-Continuation-to-quot-My-American-nightmare-quot/page3">http://www.unforumzed.com/showthread.php?910-Continuation-to-quot-My-American-nightmare-quot/page3</a></p>
