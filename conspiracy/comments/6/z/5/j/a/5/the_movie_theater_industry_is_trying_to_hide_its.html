        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>When I was a teenager, going to the movies on a Friday night in the summer was almost as normal as working during the week. And then there was Netflix, and then there was streaming services, and then all of the sudden it cost an arm and a leg to eat and drink at the movies. And then it cost a crap load to actually see the movie as well. Then I read article after article saying that attendance at theaters is down everywhere</p>

<p>Not to mention Hollywood&#39;s only &#39;blockbusters&#39; over the past 5-6 years have been reboots, sequels, or rehashes.. Honestly the age of original content in the  main stream movie theater is dead and gone.. </p>

<p>After I learned that &quot;It&quot; is breaking box office records.. It got me thinking.. Are all of the articles wrong? Or are people actually into the movie theater still?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agree. I just read something about this, seems the industry is stagnant. I admit I love movies but won&#39;t pay to see ill-made/re-made crap. When I was a child we used to the matinee on Saturdays.</p>

<p>I think there&#39;s still a market, just has to be what people are willing to pay for. Dinner theaters tried to trend but ppl complained about the food or service. Video service has changed everything, still, there&#39;s nothing like watching a good film in a theater.</p>

<p>Enter “It,” Warner Bros. and New Line’s adaptation of the Stephen King novel, which is expected to scare audiences back into theaters with a record-breaking opening. A $65 million opening is expected from 4,000 locations (3,500 spots for Thursday previews).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok, I get that it was expected to break records.. But <em>why</em> was it expected to break records?</p>

<p>The Stephen King Novel is decades old. I&#39;m almost 30 and I&#39;ve never read it. So who was titillated by this and why did they rush to whatever poll or movie theater &quot;test site&quot; that was able to pull together the data to gather this &quot;$65 million&quot; debut?</p>

<p>Honest to God all I see in the previews is a clown on the sewer and I&#39;m like &quot;eh, I&#39;m all set&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You know Stephen King is a <em>major</em> writer. I read the novel (well, TBH, I&#39;ve read a lot of his books). Evidently &quot;It&quot; really &#39;struck a chord&quot; with readers; seems like A LOT of ppl have a fear of clowns.</p>

<p>The first movie was shit (imo), so now, the REMAKE (!) It irks me that a book can be good but the screenplay for the movie sucks; could be that the author &amp; the director/Hollywood aren&#39;t on the same page. </p>

<p>Can only suggest that you read one of novels first -- but only if you like the genre. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually most readers of IT are not scared due to Pennywise the clown.</p>

<p>Its how King somehow connects with our fear and innocence around that age and somehow manages to put it onto paper.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s not a conspiracy any more than saddle makers going out of business when cars became popular. </p>

<p>Thirty years ago moviegoers were complaining about sequels, the price of tickets, and the price of concessions. The difference is back then then the average home had rabbit ears and maybe a vcr, and now people have HDTV and thousands of viewing options via streaming. </p>

<p>The premium theaters and blockbuster movies will continue to thrive, but the days of going to the theater once a week are never coming back.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>See, that insanely smart. People come freely, sometimes buy a soda or popcorn.  Makes the theater a busy happening place vs a ghost town.  The last 2 movies I&#39;ve seen, we were the only group of people watching it in the theater.  Felt eerie and not too comfortable.</p>

<p>What I am unsure is, does the theater have to pay a licensing fee for each person watching the movie?  If so, there is a chance they could lose money if you get a lot of people (seniors, kids) watching too many movies and not buying items.</p>

<p>The issue is the movie studio makes their money selling tickets, and the theater makes theirs selling concessions. People on the $10 plan are unlikely to buy overpriced concessions. If the customers aren&#39;t buying tickets or concessions, they&#39;re not profitable. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey there friend, I work in the industry so maybe I can shed a little light:</p>

<p>Movie genres change with trends involving public sentiment. It&#39;s an up &amp; down industry. The largest blockbusters in the last 5-8 years have been teen dramas coupled with anti-government rage. Think &quot;hunger games,&quot; &quot;fifth wave&quot;, &quot;divergent&quot;.   This brought in the millenials &amp; was a solid formula. Strong teen heroine - week ass supporting male. It mobilized an entire generation &amp; made lots of money. But it wore off. And Hollywood is sometimes slow to see the changing tides. </p>

<p>Next up - because there are no ideas - REBOOT EVERYTHIHG! Keep
showing those badass heroines with week males &amp; remake it all. Easy formula, right? Flops. Wtf went wrong? </p>

<p>Now - it&#39;s remake it, but keep it like it is - works for the music industry! Mediocre returns. </p>

<p><em>WHY WONT AMERICA COME SEE OUR SHIT??</em></p>

<p>Let&#39;s do original content. Flops. Aggghhhh</p>

<p>Why is this happening?</p>

<p>They can&#39;t read GenZ. They are terrified to look into the eyes of their consumers, so they won&#39;t. </p>

<p>It&#39;s nothing to do with tickets or popcorn or a big-ass soda, but rather an inability to face their audience. Actors being political, studios being willfully blind. It&#39;s a tsunami of crappola &amp; their audience is already on higher ground. </p>

<p>Hollywood needs a major come-to-Jesus moment. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not only &quot;The Agenda.&quot;</p>

<p>This is also the closing of ranks and increased secret society membership and &quot;initiations&quot; to make sure everybody is blackmail-able and even the minor &quot;sinners&quot; (a gay actor who plays macho heroes, or a friendly TV day who likes hand jobs from 16  year old blonds, say) won&#39;t &quot;out&quot; the horrific criminals (the A-listers and top execs who enjoy raping and killing young boys and kills, for example).</p>

<p>People with morals and conscience can&#39;t go through the initiations and are gradually weeded out of good roles. Or they compromise even a bit and look the other way, and then it&#39;s into the cesspool.</p>

<p>Over time, more and more of the Hollywood population is only perverts, criminals, pedophiles, immoral and amoral scum. So the entertainment reflects that. And general, decent people flee from it. </p>

<p>The movie theater business is in deep shit. They may actually be the only people with the power to make Hollywood create better product, so it puts butts in their seats. But Hollywood may not care and just keep making shit for the entire world and say F.U. to USA theaters. </p>

<p>No idea. Other than I rolled in Hollywood in the late 90s for about five years and it was seriously fucked up and full of occultists then. I can only imagine what it&#39;s like now. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is a brilliant reply to the idea that conspiracies can&#39;t exist because &quot;that many people couldn&#39;t keep a secret.&quot;  Of course people aren&#39;t going to hide other people&#39;s dirty laundry for no reason, but when other people&#39;s secrets are mutually entangled with your own dirt, there&#39;s a healthy dose of self-interest.</p>

<p>That was definitely my own experience working corporate jobs.  At a certain level, everyone is complicit in some level of fraud, or your career simply stops advancing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes. People should keep in mind that ANY big star you see on screen has almost certainly:</p>

<p>1- Eaten a turd and drank piss.
2- Fucked while people watched.
3- Gotten fucked in the ass (male or female), while people watched.
4- Killed somebody. </p>

<p>Ever listen to William Shatner&#39;s phone call to the cops when he &quot;found&quot; his dead wife at the bottom of the pool. Pretty bad acting. I especially like when they tell him not to hang up and he immediately hangs up. </p>

<p>John Travolta, Eric Clapton, Bill Cosby, Robert Plant, Sly Stallone, Prince, Willie Nelson, Roy Orbison (BOTH sons), Paul Newman, Marlon Brando, Gregory Peck, Charlie Chaplin, and so on. </p>

<p>Many, if not all, made deals with the devil and had to give up their kid to buy some time. Or so I&#39;ve been told by people who claim to know such things. No matter how you slice it, it&#39;s pretty unsettling the numb of Big Stars affected by such familial tragedy. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>They used to not make such shitty movies. Even if you go through the Oscar list, how many &quot;classic&quot; movies do you see there that will stand the test of time? &quot;Moonlight&quot;? &quot;Spotlight&quot;? &quot;Birdman&quot;? &quot;12 Years a Slave&quot;? &quot;Argo&quot;? &quot;The Artist&quot;? &quot;The King&#39;s Speech&quot;? &quot;Hurt Locker&quot;? &quot;Slumdog Millionaire&quot;? &quot;No Country for Old Men&quot;? &quot;Million Dollar Baby&quot;? &quot;Crash&quot;? &quot;The Departed&quot;? </p>

<p>I just went back 15 years. I see ONE movie--&quot;No Country for Old Men&quot;-- the people still talk about, that still registers in the cinephile&#39;s consciousness as a &quot;great movie.&quot; All the others were &quot;good movies,&quot; but nothing special, and, in a couple cases, not even all that good. </p>

<p>Hollywood has lost its mojo. It&#39;s magic is fading. The Holly Wood magic wand is now limited to casting a spell upon only the very young and very stupid. And they&#39;re panicking, for sure. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yep. The last three movies I saw in theaters were Deadpool, Keanu, Get Out because I felt they would be worth the money, I trusted the creators to put out a solid film. Unless I am pretty sure I&#39;m gonna like a film I don&#39;t even consider going to the theater and paying money on what I see as entertainment gambling lol. That&#39;s why most people I know don&#39;t go to theaters much anymore either, there&#39;s too much mediocre and often straight up garbage. Most of it seems to be these days </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not the fault of the theater chains- they&#39;re totally beholden to the Hollywood industry. That&#39;s where the problem is. They have to PAY to get copies of movies, and are dictated which they&#39;ll get, and often forced to buy multiple copies for multiple screens often just to help boost the appearance of a blockbuster. Raising the cost of food is literally their only profit, because ticket prices basically cover the cost of renting the movie (now just a disc!) and rent, operational costs and wages. </p>

<p>Theaters having to pay so much for a physical copy of a film used to make sense back when theaters would recieve multiple canisters of limited print film stock- but now it&#39;s literally just getting a disc in the mail and popping it in a player. Theaters have also had to foot the bill to upgrade to digital HD equipment in recent years or else go out of business.</p>

<p>The problem is totally with the film industry and Hollywood- movies cost entirely too much even though the means to make and distribute have gotten cheaper.</p>

<p>As far as dim projectors, we could always tell when a bulb was about to go and we&#39;d even stop the film to change it if we had to. Can&#39;t speak for cheapskate managers and cheap bulbs- we used what the corporation sent us that fit our old machines. They were a pain in the ass to change out, and could explode. You had to wear a leather apron and gloves and a welding type mask. Perhaps the pain in the ass was to much hassle for some places, but we did it. </p>

<p>Again I can&#39;t speak for the 3D stuff but occasionally someone would forget to change the lens from scope to flat, as projectionists we sat and watched all the previews for each film as a means to fine tune any focus, scope or brightness issues before the film started.
One of the most ridiculous complaints we had was an irate old man screaming that the previews were playing but there was no sound and the lights were still on. I ran upstairs to fix it- and realized he was an idiot. It was the ad and trivia slideshow, which was meant to be silent. His movie didn&#39;t start for another ten minutes. </p>

<p>Anyway, at our theater we weren&#39;t a franchise, we were beholden to the distribution region, which was beholden to the corporation, which was pretty much one of 5 theater monopolies that Hollywood let&#39;s show films. </p>

<p>Its how King somehow connects with our fear and innocence around that age and somehow manages to put it onto paper.</p>

<p>I think IT is one of the greatest books ive ever read but it has nothing to do with clowns.</p>
