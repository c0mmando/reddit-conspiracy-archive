<p>It&#39;s easy to find info on a myriad of subjects related to conspiracy but I struggle to find anything that is easily accessible on the discussion of the entity most people call god being a false and malevolent spirit.</p>

<p>This isn&#39;t ment to be an edgy &quot;religion is false&quot; atheism conversation. While I do think all religions of Abraham are evil I do believe in a higher &quot;light&quot; that binds in universe. </p>

<p>How has a false &quot;god&quot; been so successful in committing genocide on any line of thought that does not bow to its existence?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not exactly. The Jews were around the Mesopotamia area prior to coexisting with the Egyptians. It&#39;s thought that the origins of Judiasm was an offshoot of the Canaanite religion.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_(deity)">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_(deity)</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>According to The Oxford Companion to World Mythology,</p>

<p>It seems almost certain that the God of the Jews evolved gradually from the Canaanite El, who was in all likelihood the &quot;God of Abraham&quot;... If El was the high God of Abraham—Elohim, the prototype of Yahveh—Asherah was his wife, and there are archaeological indications that she was perceived as such before she was in effect &quot;divorced&quot; in the context of emerging Judaism of the 7th century BCE. (See 2 Kings 23:15.)[33]  </p>

<p>How has a false &quot;god&quot; been so successful in committing genocide on any line of thought that does not bow to its existence?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Hebrew G-d was angry. He killed Jews and Gentiles alike. He told Jews he loved them and that they would be &quot;a people for his name&quot;, and then kill them when they had sex with a shiksa. I can&#39;t speak for all Jews who grew up believing in G-d, but having a mass murderer for a Higher Power all of my life explains why I am an obsessive/compulsive paranoid neurotic with an inferiority complex. This must be why we build things up, and create things, to only later tear down and destroy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Hebrew G-d was angry and liked to kill. Jesus came on the scene and talked about showing love to your enemies and showing mercy and forgiveness. Jesus was about character development; having a good heart that isn&#39;t deceptive, and he was all about &quot;love&quot;. In contrast, G-d (his father), was about demanding obedience, commandments, laws, punishment and death. Yet, Jesus said &quot;if you have seen me, you have seen the Father&quot;.

<p>You think God is Evil, ok you are entitled to your own opinion. I&#39;m not sure how much of the bible you&#39;ve actually read, but God doesnt do anything arbitrarily. God has a plan, and wheter you believe it or not is up to you. </p>

<p>I take exception to people who say God was just invented to control dumb people. Again, ok that is YOUR opinion, one you cant defend or prove (neither side really can to the other sides content), but now you are just trying to belittle us who believe.</p>

<p>Im not really understanding what questions you are asking? It seems you are more just making a series of statements.</p>

<p>If you think the bible is only about being a better person, Im afraid you only read the back cover. Its so much deeper than that.</p>

<p>Really we are to blame for the woes of humanity, God is just trying to save us from ourselves. Maybe read the bible a bit and you will have a better understanding of the subject.</p>

<p>Im still here if you have anymore specific questions</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m in no way defending the genocide of a people in God&#39;s name (Inquisition). People are sinful, and will find ways to justify their desires. The fact is though, that God says to save wrath for him, he will deal with the unjust and all we are to do is love our enemies like we love our friends.</p>

<p>I kind of disagree slightly with the notion that Christians havent been persucuted. They have been dragged out of their house and stoned. Paul was beheaded, Peter crucified upside down, and many more have endured persecution all over the world. Watch the movie Silence by martin scorseses, it&#39;s about the persecution of Christians in Japan, where they are killed for their beliefs. </p>

<p>Just because you don&#39;t witness persecution where you live and it isn&#39;t in the news, doesn&#39;t mean it doesn&#39;t exist. Even to this day there are parts of the world where being christian can get you killed.</p>

<p>The similar is true with God&#39;s Law. God&#39;s Law was always meant to show us right from wrong, but while everyone is subject to it&#39;s punishments, he also provided a way for us to be seen as righteous, and recieved the punishment for us.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Morally and ethically God&#39;s law is not subjective. </p>

<p>I wouldn&#39;t say Gods law is subjective at all to be honest. Its the wrong word to use in this situation. Some may treat it subjectivly but that&#39;s another story. Some may have disagreements on meaning, but again not subjective, someone is right and someone is wrong but God has Grace so it is covered. Read Romans 14 it gives a good example of 2 different people with 2 different views coming together and how to handle it.</p>

<p>So I would disagree with the notion that God&#39;s Law is subjective. Complex yes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, i indeed could be wrong, but i severely doubt that i&#39;m wrong.
My opinion is based on the past, facts and logic. I&#39;ve done alot of amateur research into religion and their origin and this is my personal conclusion.</p>

<p>One example is norse mythology, don&#39;t you think the germanic people was just as devoted and believed just as much in those gods as we do now in the current gods? I think humans has a need to worship something, humans want a purpose that is bigger than themselves so they turn to worship.</p>

<p>Stephen Hawking explains perfectly how i think about how the universe was formed, here is a link to a detailed explanation :</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No I totally get what you are saying. Sometimes it is hard to believe things that require faith. But the average person excerises faith everyday in things that have nothing to do with God. Yet when it comes to God a lot of people find it harder. </p>

<p>There is a huge difference though as Christianity has occured in the recorded timeline of civilization from multiple sources outside of just the bible. I dont think the question is if Jesus existed, but rather was he who he says he is. </p>

<p>The question I most would like answered, that Mr Hawking sidesteps by saying it isnt important, is what is the origin of matter? For the generally accepted theory on creation one must just assume that the matter that was involved in the Big Bang has no orgin. Yet even with this major unknown variable people blindly latch on to this theory as fact. </p>

<p>And as far as Christianity being based on Astrology? I dont buy it. People have the ability to make false correlations with things that are unrelated.</p>

<p>I think a better theory is that the actual events of the bible occured as written. All these other tales that bear similarities are just influenced by the actual events that really happened and were prophesied about in the beginning, before the actual Bible was put together in the counsel of nicea. Example, the flood, if the flood actually occured you would expect multiple accounts of a flood, which you can see in many ancient writings. It doesnt mean the bible plagiarized, it just means it tells the actual account of what inspired the other writings.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting, we got some different opinions on things but thanks for a sane discussion.</p>

<p>&quot;What is the origin of matter?&quot; That is indeed a very interesting question that&#39;s hard to answer but there is some theories, one example is Kusenko’s theory.</p>

<p>Judaism, Christianity, and Islam were all born in the Middle East and are all linked to one another and i think there is just to many correlations for it to be false. I also think it makes total sense that the Abrahamic religions is based of ancient astrology worship that the egyptians practised. </p>

<p>Sure, some of the events in the bible could have happened (probably most of them that can be explained by science) but that&#39;s why a good LIE is always based on truth. There very well could have been a MAJOR flooding and it was recorded in many ancient writings but that does not mean that it was holy in any way.</p>

<p>A freeman or a slave to your stubbornness and pride?</p>

<p>God simply states right and wrong, along with the consequences for each. It&#39;s our choice to live in the love of the creator or die as a result of sin.</p>

<p>Kusenko’s theory: The theory starts 1 decillionth of a second after the big bang (sound like an arbitruary number, but ok). I want to know what happened before the big bang, but according to Steven Hawking it&#39;s unimportant.</p>

<p>And Buddha never claimed to be a God, he was a man who learned and read things just like us. He encouraged people to reach a state of enlightenment (which could be described as contentment, happiness, etc..) through study, meditation and personal discovery. The bible says seek and you shall find, and that God is a rewarder of those who diligently seek him.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, he states what HE think is right and wrong. In my opinion right and wrong is subjective and depends on the person.
You call it pride and stubbornness and i call it freedom to do as i choose.</p>

<p>I never said that i agreed with Kusenko&#39;s theory but i wanted to state that their is a few of them. It&#39;s a incredible hard question to answer that will probably never be answered, just because it&#39;s behind human comprehension religious people seem to think there is a higher power behind it.</p>

<p>I know that Buddah never claimed to be a god, he was just helping people to seek for enlightenment. Wait, are you claiming that Buddah was seeking for god?</p>

<p>And i&#39;m guessing i can&#39;t change your mind, haha. I had enough power to do extensive research on this subject and form my OWN opinion, that requires alot of will power my friend, more than most people that practise blind faith, wheter it&#39;s blind faith in religon, media or government, blind faith is ignorance.
I&#39;m not looking to change i&#39;m content with myself and my beliefs just as you are with yours i guess.</p>
