        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>A couple weeks ago I was listening to audio from 9/11 whistleblower Richard Andrew Grove&#39;s project constellation. Specifically the audio he sent in to Meria Heller which she played on her radio show. 
<a href="https://tragedyandhope.com/th-podcasts/project-constellation/">https://tragedyandhope.com/th-podcasts/project-constellation/</a>
In it he talks about how hard it is for him to get his story out. So I started thinking about how to communicate to others that all is not right with the official theory. </p>

<p>The esp8266 Internet of things(IoT) chip is a inexpensive chip that has a full tcp/ip stack, microprocessor and some flash memory. It is called the Arduino killer and is pretty damned impressive way to spend &lt;$3.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.aliexpress.com/item/5pcs-lot-New-Wireless-module-NodeMcu-Lua-WIFI-Internet-of-Things-development-board-based-ESP8266-with/32266751149.html">https://www.aliexpress.com/item/5pcs-lot-New-Wireless-module-NodeMcu-Lua-WIFI-Internet-of-Things-development-board-based-ESP8266-with/32266751149.html</a>?</p>

<p>My project utilizes this chip and the Arduino ide to create an access point and walled garden with a webserver. The chip has very limited flash space(4MB w/ 1MB for programming and 3MB SPIFFS storage). This is plenty of space for html, css and javascript and can hold images as long as they are optimized. The idea is to create a device to help spread 911 awareness. Check out the video below for a better understanding. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQM-GHY6VJ8">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQM-GHY6VJ8</a></p>

<p>The dev board draws less than 300ma from a 5 volt source so you can power it from your cell phone or it&#39;s wall wart.  It will run for 15 hours or so on a typical cell phone battery. </p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/wcat13/Project-For-9-11-Awareness">https://github.com/wcat13/Project-For-9-11-Awareness</a>
I have a bit more work to do adding content and making it clearer to build your own but it is good enough for now. </p>

<p>the projects webpages are also on github pages here.
<a href="https://wcat13.github.io/Project-For-9-11-Awareness/index.html">https://wcat13.github.io/Project-For-9-11-Awareness/index.html</a></p>

<p>Hope that at least someone will use this tool and even if it helps one person it will be worth it.  Help spread the project and thank you for your time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you watch the video(the one where the guy is playing trumbone...skip ahead) you&#39;ll get a better idea of how it works.  Basically creates an open wifi access point that people can connect to.  Once connected any http request from your browser redirects to the projects pages being hosted on the device.  So by running this sucker you can spread 911 truth to anyone within range of the device.  Say 30 yards give or take.  I plan on creating a couple that can solar charge and run till charge deplete then charge up again the next day.  Think college engineering depts, coffee shops anywhere really.  The idea is to get a bunch of folks making them.  I can make them and send them to people but it is all open source and easy enough to make your own.   Also great gift ideas for friends and family.</p>

<p>I can&#39;t think of any other way to get this info to general public.</p>

<p>Critique welcome by all means, thanks for your interest</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Mossad and its American associates are the obvious culprits. Who benefits from the crime? The attacks against the twin towers started at 8:45 a.m. and four flights are diverted from their assigned air space and no air traffic controller sounds the alarm. And no Air Force jets scramble until 10 a.m. That also smacks of a small scale Air Force rebellion, a coup against the Pentagon perhaps? Radars are jammed, transponders fail. No IFF -- friend or foe identification -- challenge. In Pakistan, if there is no response to IFF, jets are instantly scrambled and the aircraft is shot down with no further questions asked. This was clearly an inside job. Bush was afraid and rushed to the shelter of a nuclear bunker. He clearly feared a nuclear situation. Who could that have been? Will that also be hushed up in the investigation, like the Warren report after the Kennedy assassination?</p>

<p>The whole world already knows this. This is a simple restatement of what everybody already knows.</p>

<p>Everywhere except in America, where Jewish dominated media envelops everyone in a poisoned darkness, everybody knows that Jewish kingpins pulled off 9/11 as an excuse for making war on every obstacle to their world financial hegemony, and killing as many non-Jews as possible in the process to further consolidate their domination of the whole world.</p>

<p>This widening war on the Islamic world, already responsible for millions of unnecessary deaths, is a direct result of the 9/11 hoax, everything based on false spin concocted by Jewish strategists not for U.S. best interests, but for the demonic master plan of the Jewish Sanhedrin, which rules the Jewish moneymen who buy the presidents and the generals, to kill or enslave the rest of the world. They control you, whether you want to admit or not. They control your bank account. And they make you support their insane war program by all this wall-to-wall patriotic spin.</p>

<p>The totally Jewish-controlled U.S. media have long ago suspended their journalistic capabilities in favor of blatant cheerleading about their favorite subject - Muslim terrorists. Every day they urge you to kill them. If there ever was a systemic hate crime, this is it.</p>

<p>Yet, as the infamous list of the 19 hijackers was released by the FBI two days after the infamous event, and except for two feeble-minded patsies, no other perpetrator has ever been arrested for the greatest crime in American history, what kind of conclusions are we to draw from the fact that all of the people who were in charge of America when this dark day happened, instead of being fired for incompetence, were promoted and allowed to continue their criminal activity?</p>

<p>What does all this say about the American mind?</p>

<p>It is not functioning, thanks to the poisoned blanket of U.S. media, and a deliberately twisted educational system that has produced killer Jewish robots instead of fully invested philosophically clean humans.</p>

<p>Every cop in the world should be brought up on charges of willful obstruction of justice for not blowing the whistle on President George Bush, Vice President Dick Cheney, and all their Jewish handlers - in the White House, in the Congress, in the media, and most especially in the banks) for their stunningly criminal behavior in both lying about the events and implementing a totally illegal coverup of the crime scenes.</p>

<p>But the Jewish judges atop the U.S. legal system said it was all OK, and the media, led by the New York Times and CNN, never mentioned all those Jewish fingerprints visible in the pyroclastic dust covering the disintegrated corpses in the rubble of the Twin Towers.</p>

<p>In an interview only a mere weeks after 9/11, Hamid Gul - former head of Pakistani intelligence (ISI) from 1987-1989 - told Arnaud de Borchgrave, United Press International, of who he thinks was behind the attacks. Here are a few exceprts from the transcript:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>De Borchgrave: So who did Black Sept. 11?</p>

<p>Gul: Mossad and its accomplices. The U.S. spends $40 billion a year on its 11 intelligence agencies. That&#39;s $400 billion in 10 years. Yet the Bush Administration says it was taken by surprise. I don&#39;t believe it. Within 10 minutes of the second twin tower being hit in the World Trade Center CNN said Osama bin Laden had done it. That was a planned piece of disinformation by the real perpetrators. It created an instant mindset and put public opinion into a trance, which prevented even intelligent people from thinking for themselves.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://www.upi.com/UPI-interview-with-Hamid-Gul/60031280349846/">https://www.upi.com/UPI-interview-with-Hamid-Gul/60031280349846/</a></p>

<p>Immediately after the attacks Bin Laden was interviewed by Pakistani newspaper Ummat. When asked if he was involved in the attacks he stated:</p>

<p>&quot;I have already said that I am not involved in the 11 September attacks in the United States. As a Muslim, I try my best to avoid telling a lie. I had no knowledge of these attacks, nor do I consider the killing of innocent women, children and other humans as an appreciable act. Islam strictly forbids causing harm to innocent women, children and other people. Such a practice is forbidden even in the course of a battle.&quot;</p>

<p>He went on to say:</p>

<p>&quot;In the same way, whether it is President Bush or any other U.S. President, they cannot bring Israel to justice for its human rights abuses or to hold it accountable for such crimes. What is this? Is it not that there exists a government within the government in the United States? That secret government must be asked as to who carried out the attacks.&quot;</p>

<p>He further goes on to state:</p>

<p>&quot;I have already said that we are not hostile to the United States. We are against the [U.S. Government] system, which makes other nations slaves of the United States, or forces them to mortgage their political and economic freedom. This system is totally in the control of the American Jews, whose first priority is Israel, not the United States. It is clear that the American people are themselves the slaves of the Jews and are forced to live according to the principles and laws laid down by them. So the punishment should reach Israel. In fact, it is Israel, which is giving a blood bath to innocent Muslims and the U.S. is not uttering a single word.&quot;</p>

<p>You know all this is true. You know you are living a lie every day, by accepting what the TV robots tell you is true.</p>

<p>Yet you wring your hands and kvetch that you don&#39;t know what to do, when in fact you do. You just don&#39;t have the courage to do it, because you&#39;re a robotized American dreckdroid, who goes out and kills other people for reasons simply because you have been ordered to by those who control you. Despicable. You are despicable, because you don&#39;t have the courage to say what you clearly know, even though you about to lose everything you ever loved because of your failure to say what you know and confront the beast. And now it&#39;s too big to stop.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have been working on using hello mesh in that way. With a chat window as well as ace editor. 433 or 900 mhz would be better distance but the hello mesh worked well with my first test and 3 esp&#39;s. I decided for this project to make as much space for images as possible. </p>

<p>I think I will mail a couple of these things out to ae911truth, maybe Chandler.  If I could get an organization to give them out on donation or at events.</p>
