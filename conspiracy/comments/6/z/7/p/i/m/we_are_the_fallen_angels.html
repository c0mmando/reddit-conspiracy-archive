        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;ve come to realise through my own experiences, personal study and through what is happening around the world today that the monotheistic religious texts are all reinterpretations of far more ancient knowledge.</p>

<p>I am a dualist, which is to say that there is a distinct separation of body and spirit. The body is a vessel which is used by the one spirit (a culmination of all consciousness in the universe) to answer questions or at least gather more awareness about existence.</p>

<p>Whilst inhabiting the physical world all people experience trials and tribulations of varying degrees then die, returning back to the underlying spirit. All people commit sin, however small.</p>

<p>My theory is that there is no heaven and hell in the literal sense but if you were to separate it out in a distinction such as that then the physical world is hell and when we return to the spirit that is heaven. The physical world is hell because it is the manifestation of existence that we face trials in and are fallible. The spirit is heaven because it is a unity of all consciousness. When we return we enjoy all the understanding of the universe and are therefore infallible. There is no need for sin as the spirit because it has all been experienced and understood in one way or another through the physical world.</p>

<p>Until we come together and solve the issues created by us in the physical world and create heaven on Earth we will continue the cycle of birth, trial (through experience) then death endlessly paying for the sins of previous lives in ironic ways.</p>

<p>In the coming years I think we will be given partial disclosure of hidden history of the earth (read into theories about Antarctica, perhaps an ancient civilisation has been discovered under the ice) but it will be controlled by TPTB through deception (project bluebeam) to establish a new world order. In this time we will see a huge leap in technology and state of living and we will be deceived into giving up the concept of God. We will give up personal freedom and buy into the farce. Technology such as rfid chips and brain augmentations will grant TPTB total Monopoly on our existence in the physical world. There prerogative is to become God&#39;s on Earth with total control of it&#39;s people. Essentially we will have sold our souls for a golden cage. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Essentially yes. I believe that life is common in the universe but most is very primitive. This is because of the Fermi paradox. If life evolves to the level of conscious intelligence it will either destroy itself or evolve through artificial means (technology) toward the singularity in an exponential fashion. We are at that gate right now. Either we collaborate with one another and advance outside of biological constraints or we destroy ourselves. </p>

<p>All life regardless of whether it is terrestrial or otherwise forms part of the same collective consciousness we call god, but we are most likely to reincarnate from a terrestrial past(s) due to biological similarities.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We&#39;re already in the end times... and i got here by conspiracy theorying ;).</p>

<p>They are faking the end times and the apostles and prophets saw it because of astral projection which allows them to see in the future or past. Thry are using HAARP to do the hurricanes and earthquakes and they will fake an alien invasion/rapture/coming of jesus with project blue beam.</p>

<p>If you like esoteric works you should read thoths emerald tablets. He also speaks of it and hes regarded as a great mage in the occult world who was reincarnated twice and his final reincarnation was as hermes trimegistrus or thrice great.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>See, I had the opposite path in. I was an atheist that started experimenting with fasting for health reasons and then decided to try to see if using spiritual practices outside of a structured context would produce results. They did, I had some extremely amazing, unsettling, life altering experiences and then as part of integrating what I experienced I found a bunch of conspiracy theory stuff that dovetailed remarkably well with what I felt like I had experienced.</p>

<p>Yeah, I&#39;m pretty sure we&#39;re in the end times too, but which form they take is the big question. Knowing that &#39;they&#39; are lying to you and to trust your own heart, intuition and feeling of what is right or wrong before even what your eyes show you will probably be extremely important when the shit really starts to go down.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My path here was the same as yours. Atheism is the entrapment of choice these days. It used to be that TPTB would use religion to indoctrine you into service but people began finding spirituality for themselves outside of the standard template, which is bad for those who want to keep control. So they make atheism fashionable as the path of reason. They&#39;ve taken science and used it against itself. Made it a cult. And sold the thought that anyone who even entertains the idea of searching into the concept of God as a crackpot, or someone of lesser intelligence and reason. </p>

<p>Spirituality isn&#39;t something that this book or that will teach you. But through critical thought and your own research you can find the right path for yourself. Nobody has all the answers, knowledge is knowing that you know nothing. We are all on a journey with the same ending whether we fit in to whatever egotistical trend is fashionable or not. So why waste time pretending to be like everyone else.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re missing souls from your equation. Maybe you don&#39;t believe in them, but I think they work nicely as a link between the physical body/person and the spirit. I basically think of them as the essence of the person on a spiritual level that&#39;s a unique personality as opposed to the spirit which I think of as the part of the person that is more or less merged with the collective totality and thus &#39;lacks&#39; some of the individual distinction that a singular personality would have.</p>

<p>At our core, we&#39;re all creator gods, that, for whatever reason(I think it&#39;s collective self imposed trauma that damaged our memories and the psychic stability of humanity&#39;s collective consciousness, but your guess is as good as mine) have lost/forgotten our divine powers. The nature of miracles, weird &#39;matrix glitches&#39; and a whole bunch of weird supernatural phenomena is actually a demonstration of the conscious mind&#39;s ability to sculpt reality both individually and collectively, but most of us aren&#39;t aware of this and those of us that are aren&#39;t always in a position to fully exploit it. </p>

<p>TPTB are fully aware of the hidden potentialities in the human body and mind and various factions have been working for longer than recorded history to steer/suppress/direct those abilities in specific ways, primarily with the goal of keeping people in the dark as to their true nature and actual abilities. The gateway to heaven lies within and so does the living word of the living god and both heaven&#39;s majesty and the true nature of god are far more incredible than any religious or spiritual system has taught us to believe. The &#39;god&#39; within when fully awakened has access to the treasuries of heaven, but activating it is one hell of a task, one might even call it The Task and fundamental purpose for existence and it&#39;s nature and how to access and develop our connection to it has been hidden from us for a very long time.(In a technical sense, we actually hid this knowledge from ourselves rather than having it taken from us, but it&#39;s a bit of a mindfuck to go around in a conceptual place in which another person/group of people that terrorized/traumatized you and hid the truth from you are actually aspects of one&#39;s own divine nature &#39;hiding the truth&#39;.)</p>

<p>One of the big tricks TPTB like to play with the consciousness stuff is to only encourage stuff that channels our consciousness into idealized psychically peaceful spaces, think monks meditating in caves, suffering pacifist martyrs Idealizing pacifists as being more spiritually evolved and other stuff like that. You can&#39;t productively control a lot of these forces if you&#39;re not coming from a position of inner peace, but the jesus imagery/iconography and the stuff like that from other spiritual leaders can also function as an insidious mental cage that results in one accepting their own psychic/conscious imprisonment here out of a mistaken belief in how exactly the unseen realms interact with the conscious mind.</p>

<p>If we were brave enough and awake enough, we would realize that the &#39;demons&#39; &#39;angels&#39; &#39;aliens&#39; &#39;fairies&#39; and all other manner of things of that nature actually &#39;work&#39; for &#39;us&#39;(pardon the excess of quotation marks). The concept is really quite hard to properly express since many spiritual entities take forms that match the expectations of the perceiver. The deceiver is ever present and deception is actually a major part of the reason for existing in a state of separation from &#39;god&#39;. A consciousness can&#39;t train itself to remember it&#39;s true nature if it starts the journey with full knowledge and never needs to work to discern illusion from reality.</p>

<p>Anyway, there&#39;s my probably incoherent ramblings. I believe very strongly that something exceptionally big is coming down the pipeline in the next months or maybe 1-3 years. The full scope and scale of it is beyond anyone&#39;s ability to predict, because conscious mental states actually literally shift probability fields and alter potential possible futures, so once you realize that playing prophet beyond super vague &#39;we&#39;ve got something fucking huge on its way&#39; is a fool&#39;s errand.</p>

<p>Also, as a final aside. Always bet on jesus. I can&#39;t go into too much detail on this, because the reasoning is long, convoluted and unnecessary, but suffice to say it doesn&#39;t matter whether the stories about jesus are true, or if the entire religion is a huge fraud or whether you&#39;re an atheist. You can believe me or not, but there&#39;s an aspect of &#39;jesus&#39; that pre-dates the actual figure that may or may not have existed and exists hidden within the minds of any conscious being. You can think of it as &#39;jesus&#39; or &#39;the sun&#39; or &#39;the son&#39; or as a jungian psychoanalytic symbol for the self created child of god. There&#39;s a reason a lot of people who encounter &#39;psychotic delusions&#39; start feeling like they&#39;re a reincarnation of christ or something like that and then feel all embarrassed after they come down. The truth is, everyone actually has the capability inside to access the same part of themselves that is represented by the jesus myth, but our understanding of hings has become so warped that people think of jesus as an external person as opposed to a narrative representation of an internal psychic force that always wins if it&#39;s allowed to do it&#39;s work. Each one of you is the son/sun/daughter of the living god inside you and never trust anyone who tries to distance you from it. I fucking hate priests and religious communities so much for this reason. They hide the real rules fro us and give us fake rules that they expect us to feel bad about deviating from, even though no one should need any rules beyond the one&#39;s imposed on them by their own little slice of the living word.</p>

<p>That&#39;s my story I hope you liked it....</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m using these terms for want of a better way of saying it. I&#39;ve read the Bible and Quran and both have striking similarities to Egyptian mythology. For instance the goddess ISIS bore a son Horus without physical conception and the imagery associated with ISIS and the baby Horus is thought to have been borrowed into the imagery we see of Mary and baby jesus.</p>

<p>When I speak of God what I am actually referring to is energy. Think about it, energy is omnipotent, omnipresent, omniscient. Everything that exists is energy. You could replace the word God in all monethiestic texts with energy and in that context a lot of what is discussed makes more sense. The people that wrote these texts were writing with far less knowledge of the world that we have today and so wrote about things they experienced in words that made sense to them. Chariots riding on flames coming from the sky. Does that not sound familiar to something we have today? </p>

<p>without physical conception</p>

<p>I&#39;m going to give you some more quotes:</p>

<p>&quot;All religion to the extent that it is meaningful must be interpreted esoterically. Do you think a virgin birth is literal? No, of course not. It&#39;s so silly that it is meant to provoke you to question what the symbolism could be. </p>

<p>Christianity is correct to emphasize the virginal birth and sacrifice. What the virgin birth means is that he rose to consciousness outside of the mystery schools, which laid bare the fraud of them concealing knowledge. His entire life was lived as a sacrifice spreading the truth to ensure that connection to higher consciousness / the godhead would never be the exclusive possession of the corrupted schools.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you&#39;ve hit the nail on the head in that quote for half of the story. In the post I mentioned that the Bible, Quran and I think the Torah are all reinterpretations of a teaching  that was passed on to humanity by a far more ancient civilisation. (I haven&#39;t read the Torah on the account of not being able to find an English translation)</p>

<p>To give you an idea of where I&#39;m coming from this is going to be a very long comment so try and stay with me though it may be a little painful. </p>

<p>The book of Genesis is a reinterpretation of the original teaching but uses terms familiar to the people that wrote it and first describes how the universe came to be. On the first day (read as era) Heaven and Earth were created. These can be interpreted as the physical plane of space-time (earth and all other matter) and the non physical plane of consciousness (heaven). </p>

<p>I think In the first &#39;day&#39; it is referring to the big bang when all the fundamental forces were created. &quot;the earth was without form, and void; and darkness upon the face of the deep.&quot; Set about by the beginning of the force time. Earth in this context refers to matter in general. After, the book states &quot;god said let there be light&quot;. In a literal interpretation this could be the time in which gravity began to form which caused matter to clump and eventually form stars including our sun.</p>

<p>In the second &#39;day&#39; the sky is formed. &quot;And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters.&quot; This to me is suggesting that the next part of the creation of life on Earth was an atmosphere forming around the planet, thus allowing stable temperatures required for water. Again in line with modern understanding of physics.</p>

<p>In the third &#39;day&#39; &quot;God said, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry [land] appear: and it was so.&quot; As the atmosphere formed and in conjunction with volcanicity the earths geography changed to form distinct landmasses and oceans. It&#39;s believed that early Earth was 98% covered in ocean.</p>

<p><a href="http://metro.co.uk/2008/12/31/early-earth-was-covered-in-water-274995/">http://metro.co.uk/2008/12/31/early-earth-was-covered-in-water-274995/</a></p>

<p>In the fourth &#39;day&#39; &quot;God said: ‘Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days and years;&quot;. I think this refers to the explosion of new stars as the universe matured.</p>

<p>In the fifth &#39;day&#39; &quot;God created the great sea-monsters, and every living creature that creepeth, wherewith the waters swarmed, after its kind, and every winged fowl after its kind; and God saw that it was good.&quot; This is of course is referring to how evolution has seeded the planet with life of all variety, first starting in the oceans, again as we understand it today. What&#39;s important to note is the phrase &#39;after it&#39;s kind&#39;. I.e speciation through evolution.</p>

<p>In the sixth &#39;day&#39; &quot;God said: ‘Let us make man in our image, after our likeness; and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.’&quot; this one refers to our own evolution. We are one of the youngest species and came after all the other &#39;kind&#39;. Importantly here &#39;god&#39; specifies we are made in his image. Something I believe was added in for influence by the ancient civilisation and will get to that.</p>

<p>And we are now in the seventh &#39;day&#39;.</p>

<p>The other books that form these religious texts including the book of Enoch and Daniel etc I believe are interpretations of things that other humans witnessed that they had no way of explaining so judged as miracles caused by God or the angels/watchers. </p>

<p>As for the watchers, to me this can only be explained by there being an ancient civilisation (terrestrial or otherwise) that made contact with these people. My hunch is that it was a terrestrial race of humans that lived in modern day Antarctica that shared their knowledge of the universe to the other people and interbred with them (nephillim). </p>

<p>That civilisation, I believe, was rediscovered some time ago and will be used by TPTB to establish a new world order on the back of their technology and history.</p>

<p>Hope this helps explain my post a bit better, I&#39;m happy to try and answer any questions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s exactly what it is. This wouldn&#39;t be a change just an acceleration to the end goal. I believe that end goal is a significantly smaller population, ran by an autocratic government that has total control of every facet of your life, down to your thoughts. That&#39;s what the roll out of those hand RFID chips are for (GPS, vital signs) and elons neuralink (mind control/reading).  </p>

<p>These people are the richest that exist. They have every material thing they could want. Money doesn&#39;t buy happiness though, they want to be worshipped. </p>

<p>It all comes down to greed and power. If those two things didn&#39;t exist all of humanities problems would seem trivial to solve. We could reforest the planet in a decade, provide food and water for all, even teraforming Mars could be done in our lifetime.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Beware that duality is insane people fighting insane people. Duality is an illusion. Light vs dark is an illusion. It hides obvious lessons from our minds that facilitate evil. The faux light disarms us like HIV. </p>

<p>Evil is simply self-serving behavior even at the expense of others. All other things labeled evil are unfortunate experiences with causality in ignorance. Parasites are by definition self-serving at the expense of others. They infiltrate and undermine systems in order to serve themselves. They rely on deception and coercion to overcome the lack of consent for their behaviors. They knowingly choose to take freedom and value from others. It&#39;s their nature.</p>

<p>The real conflict is parasites vs their hosts. It&#39;s clear in this framing of the conflict that hosts do not need parasites, but parasites need hosts. Contrast this idea with what we&#39;re told about the light dark duality paradigm. We&#39;re told the dark must exist to even give value to the light. It&#39;s bullshit. No, the faux light needs to exist or we will do the natural instinctual thing which actually works to get rid of them. The faux light calls it dark to deter us from doing it. They&#39;ll say it&#39;s to prevent war. They aren&#39;t preventing the parasitic feeding that provoked the war though, how strange.</p>

<p>Every human and every complex organism has an immune system that identifies, targets and eliminates parasitically intentioned organisms. They need them, because opportunistic parasites will always emerge and when they do the organism deals with them effectively or suffers and dies. Why turn it off? Who benefits?</p>

<p>When most intelligent beings, even many animals, witness the behavior of parasitic beings, they have fear. They want to get away from them or kill them. As intelligent beings, we know intelligent parasites being free is a threat to freedom and value. When we see them operate we want to restrain or kill them, depending on the severity. This initial reaction is universal and doesn&#39;t have to be taught.</p>

<p>So, what is the merit in forgiving, instead of restraining or killing, parasitic beings that don&#39;t want to stop? Is that not a recipe for AIDS? (Autoimmune Deficiency Syndrome) won&#39;t that let parasitic diseases thrive? Why do we as consciousness want that outcome? Is there not a better way, that doesn&#39;t even need to be taught? </p>

<p>We should regard our corrective emotional attributes as sacred for our independence. How can we live free without them? Yet, the faux light would have us forsake fear, because it takes us out of love. Why not embrace its purpose? It&#39;s there to protect what we love. We fear that which threatens what we love. That is the way its supposed to work. Should we abandon it and be like the Eloi from the movie Time Machine? They didn&#39;t resist being harvested and consumed by an underground parasite species and they were beautiful. They remind me so much of what the faux light apparently wants for us. We are to be easy prey for the dark, cry, forgive them, and repeat. </p>

<p>I&#39;m going to give you some more quotes:</p>

<p>&quot;All religion to the extent that it is meaningful must be interpreted esoterically. Do you think a virgin birth is literal? No, of course not. It&#39;s so silly that it is meant to provoke you to question what the symbolism could be. </p>

<p>Christianity is correct to emphasize the virginal birth and sacrifice. What the virgin birth means is that he rose to consciousness outside of the mystery schools, which laid bare the fraud of them concealing knowledge. His entire life was lived as a sacrifice spreading the truth to ensure that connection to higher consciousness / the godhead would never be the exclusive possession of the corrupted schools.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My path here was the same as yours. Atheism is the entrapment of choice these days. It used to be that TPTB would use religion to indoctrine you into service but people began finding spirituality for themselves outside of the standard template, which is bad for those who want to keep control. So they make atheism fashionable as the path of reason. They&#39;ve taken science and used it against itself. Made it a cult. And sold the thought that anyone who even entertains the idea of searching into the concept of God as a crackpot, or someone of lesser intelligence and reason. </p>

<p>Spirituality isn&#39;t something that this book or that will teach you. But through critical thought and your own research you can find the right path for yourself. Nobody has all the answers, knowledge is knowing that you know nothing. We are all on a journey with the same ending whether we fit in to whatever egotistical trend is fashionable or not. So why waste time pretending to be like everyone else.</p>
