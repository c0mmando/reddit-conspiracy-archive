       This isn't a new theory I'm sure but I just wanted to post a few thoughts on the subject.
      </p>
      <p>
       As most of us on this sub are aware, there is a huge amount of propaganda being pushed onto the web to influence public opinion on various subjects. YouTube, Google, Facebook and many other sites are now using advanced AI to alter what information any given user is subjected to. I believe Reddit too is using similar tactics.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/amp/s/thenextweb.com/artificial-intelligence/2017/08/02/youtube-unleashes-google-ai-crack-extremist-content/%3famp=1">

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       I have noticed posts and comments I have made to distinguish patterns in votes and have found that karma changes up and down regardless of how many new views they have, which tells me that they are not necessarily correlated with one another. A post will be downvoted without actually receiving any new views so can only mean that either this is automated (AI interpreting whether the post fits an agenda then adjusting accordingly) or mods have the power to alter this manually.
      </p>
      <p>
       The purpose of Reddit isn't to stifle information as much as it is to influence users into believing that certain mentalities (pro-war, nationalism, race inequality etc) are the norm and therefore what you should believe.
      </p>
      <p>
       A take away to combat this is to think more critically about information and opinions presented and make up your own mind without taking heed too much of the apparent "public" opinion and use the power of democracy to combat the influence. I.e use the voting buttons much more frequently and comment regardless of how you expect your opinion to be received.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: I have assumed it to be the CIA that is causing this social engineering phenomenon but it could just as easily be other intelligence agencies or a mix of many. The point is that content and commentary on here is being used as a means to manipulate it's population.

       In other words, to make everyone think that everyone thinks this way.  Have you considered why would they feel the need to do this? Isn't it a rather desperate attempt? Have you considered how majority of people
       <em>
        really
       </em>
       think and feel in private?  The feeling that you have of being isolated or alone is really just a carefully cultivated illusion.

       Stay positive and hopeful that the truth eventually wins. A single, well-sourced lucky comment can negate all of the propaganda that was fed to thousands of people on a topic.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here is a list of news articles and other information about shilling:
       <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/shills/comments/4kdq7n/astroturfing_information_megathread_revision_8/">

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       The best thing we could do to mitigate some of the effects of this social media control is to spread information about it. The more people who know about it, the more people will be skeptical of vote tallies and what they see at the top of comments sections and their front page. The only reason the propaganda is so effective is because people aren't aware of it. A person is much more likely to engage with and be convinced by an ad if they don't even know it's an ad. It's basically just a giant peer pressure machine. They pretend to be your peers (fellow redditors), and manipulate the votes in such a way as to make you think the general consensus is this or that.
      </p>
      <p>
       They can hide links from most of the public by simply using a bunch of accounts to downvote posts early on so they don't gain traction. They of course cannot hide everything, so the other tactic is to just keep participating instead of giving up just because your content was buried a few times.

       I wish I had your confidence.  As George Orwell demonstrated and warned about, deception might not last forever under normal conditions, but combined with the usage of social engineering/social revision it can certainly last indefinitely.
      </p>
      <p>
       So much money has been poured into mapping out human psychology and devoloping propoganda/methodologies to influence the human brain and manipulate the public in addition to all of the monitoring that I think there's a real risk of a 1984 situation if the wrong person ever holds the key (Snowden's idea of a latchkey government supports this nicely).
      </p>
      <p>
       That's not to say that the people who run the show right now aren't awful.  However, lets say somebody like Hitler, Napoleon, or Stalin (Trump doesn't really compare imo though people do equate him with such figures) takes control of the government.  Somebody with the drive and intelligence to really seize control of the reigns.
      </p>
      <p>
       America has become so consumed with war that as a society we've sort of rationalized/normalized what our government gets away with.  Personally, while World War 3 is a terrifying prospect, that's really only the tip of the possible outcomes that worry me.

       I would agree with you that such an act is ideal if it could be carried out successfully.  So far however, this metholdogy has proved very ineffective.  Pretty much
       <em>
        all
       </em>
       of the people who have acted in this way have been disposed of.  Modern society is essentially designed to stack the cards against such individuals not only through setting up mechanisms to be used against them, but by engineering the public's thought patterns in such a way that they become resistant to such revelations.
      </p>

       New methodologies have to be created if one is to fight the beast.

       True.  It's a complicated situation.  Both anonymity and publicity carry certain pros and cons.  The importance to me though isn't whether you're anonymous or public.  It's how you play the game.
      </p>
      <p>
       The old school way of trying to bring things to the public eye and that they'll somehow sort themselves out doesn't work anymore, if it ever did in the first place.  But you are right that sitting on information/working behind the scenes runs the risk of having even less of an effect if you do get targeted.

       That is the big question. There doesn't seem to be very many viable options to win this game. Being vocal is the only option I can think of really.

       I do believe though, if we can wake up enough people to what is going on we can force a revolution and stop the descent into destruction that we are currently on.

       True.  But what do you mean by world?   How do you define world?  How does one "save the world" without also saving the sister worlds  the multiverse being what it is?

       We are here to learn and in some cases to serve but not in the way most expect.  There's a lot more going on behind the scenes than just earthly politics.

       Mmm...and so I ask again.  With that in mind...which part of that plane?  Which reality?  Which point in space-time do you hope to save?

       "Existence" is such a nebulous term lol.  We're more than just meat suits.  Are bodies are temporal as well as physical.

       It's being revealed.  As we speak.  The curtain is being pulled back gradually but also inevitably.

       Our conceptualization of "reality" as you put it is false and illusory.  And that's part of the game.

       I'm sorry you've lost me a bit here. I'm just using the terms I have best at my disposal. If you'd write a post about your theology I'd love to read it to understand where you're coming from though.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think you're referring to dualism in a sense which I agree with, I think body and spirit are two separate entities. Also you seem to be insinuating simulation theory too which is another theory I buy into and coincides with dualism.

       It worked to an extent.  Though the circles that made up the East German government were never fully dealt with and likely continue to affect the nation to this day.  Not to mention that most Soviet officials have maintained their allegiance to Russia/the SU even after its collapse.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would also argue that it was more than just the protests that did it though that certainly played a part.

       Yet your assertion was that it was the protests themselves that led to the deconstruction of the wall.  Not any of the other numerous factors that put pressure on the Soviets to destroy it.  I think the protests were more the straw that broke the camels back than the actual defining reason for the collapse of the wall.  Protests had been occurring for some time before its fall without the wall collapsing.

And indeed, free speech reemerged when the Eastern Communistic Bloc regimes - more or less peacefully - collapsed.

       You should have probably explained this at the start in order to prevent individuals misconstruing your meaning like I did.

      <p>
       Anyways the discussion between me and him had very little to do with freedom of speech so I don't know where you're pulling that from.  I mean, I guess it could be seen that way in a roundabout fashion, but it had less to do with freedom of speech itself and more about how to disclose certain uncomfortable truths to the public in a way that they would believe and act upon.  But I think you're sort of missing the point of what we were talking about.  Which is probably
       <em>
        why
       </em>
       I misconstrued what you were saying since it's built around a slightly different discussion/point.
      </p>
      <p>
       Free speech already exists in America.  It might have started to become slightly restricted in recent years, but it's never been the main issue of this nation until very recently and during the McCarthy era.  But that was more of the exception than the rule.
      </p>
      <p>
       My argument that "that has never at any point in history worked out though" was more in regards to discrete information being disclosed to the public in a way that leads to revolution/realization vs.  Revolution being the means of recreating freedom of speech which seems to be what you're arguing for.  The fall of the Berlin Wall had absolutely nothing to do with intelligence information getting leaked to the general public, and like I demonstrated in the articles I provided, that information was largely buried and obfuscated by the fall.
      </p>

      <p>
       I mean I get where you're coming from but the "truth" you're talking about doesn't seem to be the same "truth" I'm talking about.  Not to mention the Fall of the Berlin Wall is a
       <em>
        very
       </em>
       different situation than, say, Edward Snowden's leaks.  So I think it's hard to compare the two since one is more about disclosure of deep state secrets and the other is about a social movement built on oppression.

       Not physically no, but they let it happen.  It takes two to tango. They could have just as easily said "fuck off" and shot everybody.  That seems to be a much more common approach these days.

       You accuse me of twisting your words and yet here you are trying to dictate what OP and I talked about.  I
       <em>

       what we were talking about, and it wasn't free speech.  Just admit that you made a mistake dude.  It's not that hard.

       This doesn't mean that continuing to pursue the same goal or ideal, even after repeated attempts have proven unsuccessful, is insane. One's perspective might intelligently evolve to compensate for past shortcomings, and new moments in time and space can be seen as unique opportunities.

       It would never happen successfully. Revolutions are almost always vicious and chaotic, they also never end in utopias and free societies. This nation and the world in general is way too divided to ever agree enough to start an insurrection with common goals.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whats more likely is a bunch of warring factions (civil war on a grand scale) after hitting a certain economical and cultural tipping point like we seem to be at right now.

       They haven't ever ended in Utopias and free societies yet, but what's the harm in trying? By revolution I don't mean in the physical warring sense but in our collective culture. Change comes from within after all.

       Sounds nice but the reality is people are to vested in their own interests and pleasures. Even if you could get people to give a shit, they would all have differing goals and ideas of what is right or wrong.

       The only way we'll truly put change into effect, I believe, is through a literal consciousness awakening for humanity. Our reality has been inverted long before you or I were alive. What I mean is, there has been a focus on self-service for thousands and thousands of years, as Satan or Lucifer or whomever would want. In order for such a reality to be maintained for so long, the people who make up the society that lives this reality have to believe themselves to be something they are not. Today, the majority of humanity literally believes they are their self-image. A very small percentage of humanity fundamentally understands that what each of us truly is is consciousness, or awareness. This small percentage understands that one's entire understanding of one's self is just a thought, and all thoughts happen
       <em>
        within
       </em>
       the totality of what we actually are. Meditation opens a space within the meditator to be able to see this fact experientially, which is life changing. To see this truth is to awaken. Once one awakens, one's attachment to the world and to one's self dissipates. And such a person is most inclined to speak fundamental truth, and only truth, because no longer is there some self-image within the person for whom the person lies to get what the identity would want. I hope this makes sense. Long story short, once humanity takes a break from following the narrative that society puts in front of us on TV and radio, and once humanity looks
       <em>
        within
       </em>
       and realizes that we are all literally the same no-thing'ness, we will finally let go of this mind virus (ego, or allowing one's self-image to control one's life) and truth will reign free.

       There's no such thing - that's akin to asking the tooth fairy or one of Santa's elves to raise up n' maintain. The Pierces, the Soroses, the de Rotchschilds of the world consider themselves at war with the rest of the world, and until we agree we are at war with them they will win all the skirmishes, until eventually the war is over- and we didn't fire a shot.

       I wonder if there was some kind of way to use the spectacle's power against itself... as in, let the world's instantaneous flow of information carry the play by play of a trance-breaking event, or series of trance-breaking events, around the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       Almost like reverse-engineering the 9/11 spectacle spell. Instead of conducting terrorism, this would conduct a variation of absurdism. An event to shatter this paradigm of control, a constructed reality that many have accepted as

       Aren't some collective myths better to live in than others? Is this the best collective myth we're capable of creating?

       Once we agree that this reality is only a shared myth, then perhaps we can begin thinking creatively on which one better serves our needs.

       Given that across the world, myths have given a better life to many people, and also have given them negative experiences. Since myths are scattered throughout history, it is important to learn lessons from these many tales. There are many myths, however some can lead others into dangerous territory. This makes it an absolute necessity to ensure that a correct path is chosen, because sometimes the results are unforgiving.

       No, unfortunately, it is not the best myth we can collectively create. It is the myth we live in, so we have to make the most and best out of what we have and know, despite flaws that may exist.

       Right, the list of lies is even longer, IMO. Just some more examples of such lies, off the top of my head:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         resource scarcity is real, there will be soon not enough food and water for everybody, the Earth cannot support so many people
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         the USA and Russia are historical enemies, no way for any peaceful, productive, mutually beneficial cooperation
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         or a favourite example of mine - a space elevator is not possible to build because we have no carbon nanotubes to build 40,000 km long tethers
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       All lies to prevent you searching alternative solutions to our problems.

       Now I don't really think the Earth is flat but I've had good discussions with one of my friends about it and (correct me if I'm wrong) the spherical model gained steam around the year 1500 and seemed to be heavily influenced by the same families holding dominion over things today.

       Although you can look at from a different perspective which is reddit users use to be able to see both comment and post up votes to downvoted separately and then the combine score.  Then they took that away and started "fuzzing" the voting system.  Wouldn't surprise me if that's so that users wouldn't be able to see manipulation.

       You also have to realize most of reddit didn't have any mods and wasn't controlled by mods.  Then
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/ibr9r/new_subreddit_moderation/">
        6 years ago they took over
       </a>
       and now act like gatekeepers on stories they don't like.  For instance, go search "Awan" in r/news, 20 house democrates had they electronics and data stolen and accuse IT staff of it and asked for an investigation, which would seem like huge news.  Although r/news won't allow any posts related to it because they claim it breaks the politics rule, but most days there are blatently political posts all over their front page.  Even right now  [r/politics is removing any post about Hillary criticizing Bernie as being off topic](corrupt_ctr_mod_utherealdanhill_is_still_deleting).  This kind of thing happens on the regular as you probably know.  To think that the 5th largest website in the US isn't controlled seems naive to me.

       I agree, but the title is somewhat misleading, The CIA hasn't "taken control" of Reddit, the powers that be created Reddit, it's unfortunate that people in 2017, would assume they aren't influencing Reddit at all times, through AI, and other means, Reddit has never been a legitimate place for discussion since its creation, then again, no place on the internet has been, either.

       I personally believe they started taking interest in 08 after Aaron Swartz led the SOPA resistance movement and we saw huge, grass roots support for Ron Paul. The concerted effort to actually take it over didn't start until 2013-14, if

       He helped created RSS and was the brainchild behind reddit and was a believer in the open-source movement and sharing of information. Reddit was kind of built with this purpose originally.
      </p>
      <p>
       Unfortunately, he supposedly commited suicide while being made an example of by the institutions and was facing life something like life in jail for trumped up hacking charges.

       We lost one of the brightest minds of our generation. He could've been the next Elon Muk, but with more of focus on the internet/communication/information as opposed to practial engineering like Musk.

       Reddit's actually a pretty good example of what's going on. There's plenty of information available on the internet. Some of it is actually pretty good and reddit does a good job of concentrating it all on one site.
      </p>
      <p>
       But there's a lot of effort to flood the good stuff out with noise. So there's shit stories and fake upvotes and shitposts and shilling.

       I don't think the CIA is directly involved with reddit. Below their pay grade. The people spooging crap links and assbag comments are minimum wage shareblue losers, or they're doing it for free.

       if the CIA has Operation Mockingbird to control public opinion, why wouldn't the CIA have similar operations to control public opinion on social media?

       also, would the CIA monitor social media for chatter about the CIA, and if so, would the CIA have any motive to "correct" info or even censor info?

       i think I've noticed a pattern.
      </p>
      <p>
       through TV, they lead you to believe that theres a serial killer in every town.
      </p>
      <p>
       then they lead you to believe that hard working feds are working around the clock to stop these serial killers.
      </p>
      <p>
       thats why there are fake serial killers like the Zodiac Killer, BTK, Son of Sam, Unabomber, smiley face bomber, Sandy Hook...
      </p>
      <p>
       thats also why they put out fake stories about busting huge pedophile rings...
      </p>
      <p>
       to make you believe that the government is doing their job and/or protecting you and your loved ones.

       Of course the CIA monitors Reddit. And it wouldn't surprise me if the mere mentioning of the CIA by both of us hasn't put this in a database somewhere for someone to look at.

       The CIA has the largest budget out of every intelligence agency and has hidden nondescript office buildings throughout the country with tens of thousands of workers in front of computer screens all day.

       It's weird how this sub always complains about shareblue, or CTR before that, when the only group that has solid evidence supporting that it manipulates reddit politically are the russian troll farms who spread disinfo and pose as conservatives. That shit is legitimately happening but most of you fucking ignore it. Does anyone have proof shareblue or CTR exists in the way you claim, like having 1000s of commenters on reddit? I've never seen any proof they operate that way but a section of users always state it as if its a fact. Meanwhile, there is actual proof they're overflowing with russian trolls subverting their groups and none of them/you seem to care. Some of you need to stop chasing boogeymen and wake the fuck up to the real threats. The alt-right is being manipulated online alright, but you guys are chasing phantoms and accusing all the wrong people. It's baffling.

       I definitely agree that Russia is astroturfing on here too, as well as China, UK and all other parties with a vested interest in social engineering the populace of Reddit. I think the US is playing a major part though as this sites primary set of users are American.

       If you have any specific evidence of Russia's interference here please post it and spread the word. We need to shine a light on it and raise awareness to reduce it's effectiveness.

       Stay a while you might find out something, Everything around you is a Psyop. Everything! Think for a second about any fact you just accept as true with no validation available to you. The rabbit hole is dark, deep and lonely. You need a sound mind and strong spirit.
      </p>
      <p>
       very few people can thrive in the realm of truth. It's a lonely path. This sub is full of cointelpro and bots. There are few real users here, but it doesn't matter, it mimicks the real world. I like to come here and shout some words down on this sub. The truth has its own intrinsic value even if no one believes it. Everyone is dead asleep here and everywhere. Awakening is a spiritual thing. The Truth is inconvenient to material beings cause they don't know the truth about themselves.

       I've found the further I've delved into the rabbit hole the more spiritual I've become too. Nothing like realising your whole world is a lie to kill the ego. You're not alone, keep digging, keep publishing your thoughts, keep believing in a better future.

       4chan, especially /pol/, is blatantly seeded and astroturfed with brainwashing bullshit. whoever's behind it is trying to start a race war. i think Leftbook groups on facebook are the equivalent on the other side of the political spectrum. Divide and conquer, get people to de-humanize the enemy and channel their frustration at their own life into hatred for 'the other side...'

       This has been evident and talked about for awhile.
      </p>
      <p>
       Instead of out and out deleting content bots are used to quickly UPVOTE or DOWNVOTE content.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is a thread something that doesn't align with the entity's viewpoint? Set the bots to work and downvote into oblivion.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is a thread something that fits the entity's narrative? Set the bots to upvote and any comments within the thread that dissent are downvoted.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's how any entity—the US government, foreign governments, private corporations, etc—can easily manipulate Reddit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bots are a real thing and can be bought. We know this.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can go a step further. Have the bots create content that fits your narrative. Or hire actual people to blanket Reddit with posts that you want in the public realm.

       This age of lies is birthing two kinds of people: the man who recognizes the true depths of corruption and who then evolves to think critically and for himself (and who might also find an interest in 'enlightenment'), and he who enjoys the thrill of the illusion of fear and who fundamentally believes that the world is in secure hands. He who opposes person #2 with truth and objective fact is labeled a conspiracy theorist or schizophrenic, or is attacked ad hominem

       There's absolutely nothing wrong with nationalism, why the heck would the deep state advocate for something that would limit their control?

      <p>
       Pro-war is not an issue, there is nothing wrong with fighting just wars, unfortunately we haven't had any just wars since ww2. Just bullshit zionist wars.

      <p>
       Race inequality is the natural state of mankind because the races are different and can never be equal for as long as those differences exist. This also dovetails into the reason why we need ethno-nationalism, as it seperates the races and ensures that people cannot be treated unfairly, because humans prefer to be with their own. Race relations continue to get worse because borders existed between different peoples for a good reason, we're slowly rediscovering this fact and it will sadly end in blood.

       I don't think there have been any just wars ever. That's not to take away from the hero's that died fighting for freedom in the world wars but they were casualties of an ultimately unjust war.

       Borders are arbitrary boundaries to divide us, when the reality is we are all one people. Race should only be an indicator of one's heritage, not privelige. Heritage should be cherished but I consider all people to be my kind, regardless of background.

       Wars are necessary because evil exists, you need war to confront evil. Evil wants to destroy, it doesn't want to reason. Think of evil as a cancerous cyst, and war as the knife that can cut it off.
      </p>
      <p>
       We're not one people, we are many people, with different customs, languages, ideas and so forth. What one people prefer will differ from nation to nation, from race to race. Some groups enjoy collectivism, other groups are more individualistic and so forth.
      </p>
      <p>
       When you force people to come together, they tend to bunker down and isolate themselves to their own communities, creating micro-countries within countries, this is the natural state of man. We enjoy being around others that look like us because we ultimately prefer our children to the children of the foreigner. The family is a microcosm of the nation, and for as long as you prefer your own family over the family of the foreigner, racism and racial inequalities will always exist. To destroy it is to destroy your preference for your own child, which is a terrible thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       When borders fail, wars will begin and humanity will rediscover why borders existed in the first place. We're not going to realize this until it's too late and a lot of people will die.

       It's true people do tend to stick within their "own" but I don't think that is natural, I think it is learned behaviour. Children do not exhibit the same boundaries. We tend to fear the unknown when really we should be curious of it.

       well said
      </p>
      <p>
       it is worse than this though
      </p>
      <p>
       i can testify that this summer reddit posts i have made, and basically my entire online history, has been used for various undercovers to harass me with various scenarios to entrap me into crimes.
      </p>
      <p>
       i believe but cannot prove that only a small portion of these numerous incidents are actual law enforcement.  NoDapl reports similar types of encounters with the specific private 'security' firms that have been paid to attack them.
      </p>
      <p>
       there is a definite change here, where 'precrime' is a thing.  they decide who they would like to see in jail based upon how much your online life goes against certain narratives (in my case,  i can't stand israel, have posted a lot on r/psychonaut and am actively investigating #pizzagate/Arizona's apparent child abuse ring inside of their cps)
      </p>
      <p>
       plus my graphic about the pyramid where I list a ton of actual entitities that are bound to be also already surveilled...but the game has changed, they aren't just gathering anymore.  the little gambits they run are things like dressing up like my ex girlfriend and her current husband, or like a woman who i had a problem with at a job.
      </p>
      <p>
       my family doesn't believe me, they can't imagine cops would go to these lengths, but they don't understand it's private now.  stratfor etc has all the same information the fbi does because it's all either been leaked or they get it from fake facebork friends i have.
      </p>
      <p>
       im a comedian and writer, i can't live my life without being a public person and speaking my mind freely.
      </p>
      <p>
       it does appear that the united states may no longer be the place for me.  baiting someone, even if with shallow psych 101 crap, is a form of intimidation where you are saying 'we want you in jail, we are following you, we think you are one of the bad guys, maybe we will just frame you, or who knows what, but we are just always here expecting the worst of you, gathering more information'
      </p>
      <p>
       friends and even a girf i was with i believe turned out to be long term operatives.  it's been very tricky to determine who is real in the last few years of my life.
      </p>
      <p>
       be VERY WARY at any festivals or public events, they are out there, spying, instigating, obstructing.  it's a very scary time to be alive.  it's exactly like the matrix, all of the agents are actually the same person, and nearly anyone could turn into an agent at any moment.
      </p>
      <p>
       and the people in your life who are like 'aw gosh golly, the police dont have time to get into all that' dont have a leg to stand on, the stratfor docs point it out clearly
      </p>
      <p>
       im also afraid they are siloing us, where even if we message or email or tweet to some people, they just say, no.  or if they dont like you, then they fuck up your matches on okcupid or tinder.  or your resumes dont get to where you send them.
      </p>
      <p>
       they could totally decide who is allowed to even exist economically without you even knowing your life is being quietly ruined.
      </p>
      <p>
       again, scary times.  hiding under a rock isn't going to make it go away either.
      </p>
      <p>
       i am looking for other sites where i might be able to contribute and actually be seen and get credit for content based on the quality thereof, rather than whether or not i kiss israeli ass.

       I too have noticed that since investigating into things like pizzagate, project bluebeam, mkultra and all these other conspiracies that my internet connection is constantly bad to the point of not being useable, I am consistently being targeted by phishing and other hacking attempts. Fake PayPal emails, Honeypot traps on FB, texts with suspicious links etc and calls from actual PI numbers. It's like they are trying to find dirt on me to put me out of commission. That's why I've opted to use my real name in all my online presence. The way I see it if these people wanted to find out who I was irl they would so I may as well insure myself by letting everyone else know who I am too.

       wow, this post where i totally go out on a limb at risk to myself only has 2 votes.

      <p>
       and then what are votes here anyway but puffs of wind?
      </p>
      <p>
       so for the sake of maybe someone seeing something i write i post here, but at this point it's become clear how really risky that is, and that in the united states there is no real freedom.  only if you are a willing to be delusional enough to believe the official narrative.

       see, you respond but you don't address any real issues, and that is the exact pattern of the fake law enforcement types i encounter.

       I believe it. Often times when I read comment threads I notice a comment that doesn't quite fit or seems to support an agenda that isn't forthcoming. I'll usually click on the profile of said individual and so often they will be a redditor for 1 month.

       Yet your assertion was that it was the protests themselves that led to the deconstruction of the wall.  Not any of the other numerous factors that put pressure on the Soviets to destroy it.  I think the protests were more the straw that broke the camels back than the actual defining reason for the collapse of the wall.  Protests had been occurring for some time before its fall without the wall collapsing.
