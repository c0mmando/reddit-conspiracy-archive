<p>I believe they control most of the media we consume and use it to get us to follow their agenda and keep us divided against each other.</p>

<p>I believe they hide hints about their upcoming plans within said media through the use of symbolism and subliminal messaging. I don&#39;t think they do this to warn us, but to mock those who see it.</p>

<p>It&#39;s also occasionally very on the nose, for example a lot of big budget dystopian sci-fi movies aren&#39;t just fantasy, but a look into our future.</p>

<p>I believe they plan events decades in advance. For example, I believe 9/11 was planned decades before it actually took place. Numerology is very important in these secret societies and the numbers have meaning.</p>

<p>I believe WW3 will be started with a massive bomb detonating is Israel. When? Idk. </p>

<p>Before raging at me, keep in mind I prefaced everything with the words &quot;I believe.&quot; This could all be bullshit, but there&#39;s a lot of dots that connect together and it&#39;s interesting to think about nonetheless.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Satan&quot; as an extraterrestrial identity might not be too far from the truth.  However, once one comes to understand &quot;Satan&quot; as an extraterrestrial, one becomes so far removed from any classical biblical connotation that the name itself should simply not even be used as such at all.  Saying &quot;It&#39;s Satan&quot; creates too much confusion in people, as many immediately, knee-jerkingly, mistakenly think of the biblical version instead of - more accurately - what is likely an extraterrestrial identity.  &quot;Satan&quot;, again, connotes biblical associations that are ultimately in no way what is really happening as it relates to the extraterrestrial identity otherwise called &quot;Satan&quot;.</p>

<p>William Bramley in his book breaks down and entirely demystifies the brouhaha behind &quot;Satan&quot; and other such biblical figures in his book The Gods Of Eden (<a href="http://whale.to/c/Gods_of_Eden_Bramley.pdf">pdf of it right here</a>).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mess sroujd with similar categories, albeit aware of category fallacies.</p>

<p>But my definition of Satanism is probably different than the overloaded religious one.  </p>

<p>Its simply the inversion of Truth, Honesty and Morality.  Usually cleverly disguised as Truth, Honesty amd Morality.  The false light.  False leadership.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>By some definitions.  Sure.  Not by others.  Heck, according to some biblical sources, Satan is <em>the actual</em> truth, and it’s the other side that involves enslavement and the inversion of truth.  I’m not on any particular side, as existence is quite a lot bigger than Christianity itself.  However, the point here is that even if you want to go by biblical interpretation - which, again, is an extremely limited perspective - Satan <em>isn’t</em> only “the inversion of truth”.  According to some interpretations, Satan’s the one who had THE ACTUAL truth.  It’s the “Jesus” side that was keeping it all from humanity.  Satan’s the one who was trying to set humanity free by giving them the actual knowledge of how things <em>really</em> are.</p>

<p>Therefore, even the “Satan as the inversion of truth” perspective is certainly not the only one.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Usually cleverly disguised as Truth, Honesty and Morality. The false light =&gt; false leadership.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, I would strongly suggest reading William Bramley’s “The Gods of Eden” (<a href="http://whale.to/c/Gods_of_Eden_Bramley.pdf">pdf here</a>).  While he isn’t the only source you could refer to, he gives a pretty good breakdown of how this above perspective you mentioned here is most certainly not the only one - and may not even be the most correct.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Im also open to Satan, as an extra terrestrial /alien, or even the bibical definition, but there is scant (or even non-existent) physical evidence for either so its hard to jump that way with any type of concrete belief.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, it seems that the point here then is that looking upon a figure called “Satan” as some sort of identity involved in what the elite are doing might not be the most correct way to go.  I for one don’t entirely disagree with that.</p>

<p>Regardless, I don’t think that the main influencers of things on this planet come from the bible.</p>

<p>THE BIBLE COMES FROM <em>THEM</em>, if you will.  In other words, if nothing else, the truth is that there are ET beings that have wielded influence upon this planet that have over time come to be written about and known in biblical texts and had religions formed around them.  As such, it’s not so much about “Satan” one way or the other in any sort of biblical or religious “fire and brimstone” sense.  It’s more about an ET figure (or figures) whose true nature the bible texts ultimately confuse, and who would likely be better and more accurately understood if bible references and names were entirely discarded and the being (whoever it is/might be) were looked upon and regarded on its own away from and independent of any religious connotation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you really want to look into the potential truth of the Luciferian history I highly recommend you check out the Hidden hand material from ATS. Its alledgedly the tellings of some of the interworkings of the bloodline from this fellow who is of the spiritual branch of the family. Every so often the family has to disclose information about themselves to an audience of however many. They do this as a sort of freewill loophole so that they can say that they told us albeit if it was only one person. This stuff was conducted back in 2008 pre depression with much of what he predicted coming true and much not coming true aswell. He says that the ultimate end goal/assignment of the family is to get the masses to polarise in service to self(negativity) like themselves as opposed to service to others the positive polarity. This soul group is a soul group of the sixth density negative moving towards non-polarity. Both paths left hand/right (positive/negative ie the polarisation of choice) hand are viable paths back to the creator supposedly. This is also described in depth in the Law of one material which hidden hand claims is one of the purest and undistorted pieces of channelled material of our time(80%+ correctness)

    <div class="md"><p>I dont know to much about this but I belive they are not Satan worshipers (Satanism) but follow Luciferianism, they look at lucifer as a god and bringer of light. Not some devil that is going to bring on rapture, but a god who will show us the light. I use to laugh at the idea of god and lucifer but i very slowly begun to belive that some of these forces may actually exist on higher and lower planes of life.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is some evidence that suggests there are members of the elite that subscribe to and participate in occult practices, some of which perhaps could be linked to a form of Satanism, however it&#39;s far more likely that many of the people that have investigated this occult behavior were Christians themselves, which informs these investigations with a great deal of confirmation bias. Christians tend to think any spiritual belief that isn&#39;t Christian is a product of Satan and thus Satanism.</p>

<p>Both classes survived the Great Deluge. I think those in the Far East, are the &quot;good ones&quot;. They are not as organized, but are far more powerful, in the long run. You will not find these people in various agencies, they are the one&#39;s who are outcast. I have a bloodline to some of these families, from the Eastern world. We are in the Great Awakening/Unveiling. The light knows this, and lets it. The Dark knows this, and tries to smother it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>From an anonymous writer at the economist:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In reality, <em>(Bilderberg is an annual conference for a few dozen of the world&#39;s most influential people</em>*. Last year Bill Gates and Larry Summers hobnobbed with the chairman of Deutsche Bank, the boss of Shell, the head of the World Food Programme and the prime minister of Spain. One or two journalists are invited each year, on condition that they abstain from writing about it. (Full disclosure: the editor of The Economist sometimes attends.)</p>

<p><strong>Because the meetings are off the record, they are catnip to conspiracy theorists</strong>. But the attraction for participants is obvious. <strong>They can speak candidly, says Mr Davignon, without worrying how their words might play in tomorrow&#39;s headlines</strong>. So they find out what other influential people really think. Big ideas are debated frankly. Mr Davignon credits the meetings for helping to lay the groundwork for creating the euro. <strong>He recalls strong disagreement over Iraq: some participants favoured the invasion in 2003, some opposed it and some wanted it done differently</strong>. Last year the debate was about Europe&#39;s fiscal problems, and whether the euro would survive.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, i think the worlds most influential people are meeting to discuss how to manipulate the world in secret, because they tell us this.</p>

<p>Enjoy a free internet while you can
Speaking of personality disorders – when Peter Mandelson, who pushed through the digital economy bill, sits down with Keith Alexander – the director of the NSA and head of United States Cyber Command to discuss &quot;Social Networks: Connectivity and Security Issues&quot; you can be pretty sure they aren&#39;t hammering out how best to preserve the freedom of the internet. Add a liberal sprinkling of cyber power in the form of Mark Hughes (Facebook), Eric Schmidt (Google) and Craig Mundie (Microsoft) and you have the perfect formula for a lock-down. Let&#39;s hope Neelie Kroes, the European commissioner for digital agenda, got to push her &quot;No Disconnect Strategy&quot;. I&#39;d pay good money to have heard the head of the NSA&#39;s views on that one. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Are those people like Alex Jones and some commenters here designed to make conspiracy theorists look nuts?  Now we are getting into sociel manipulation which the CIA and FBI have been involved in for a long time and I bet so is the NSA.  Wouldn&#39;t surprise me if that&#39;s discussed at Bilderberg either.   In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cass_Sunstein#.22Conspiracy_Theories.22_and_government_infiltration">2008 Cass Sunstein proposed the Government &#39;conspire&#39; to infiltrate conspiracy groups</a>. Then in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2011/mar/17/us-spy-operation-social-networks">2011 it was revealed the military was running programs with multiple sock puppets</a> to manipulate social media. </p>

<p>Also it&#39;s not the armed guards that&#39;s the issue, it&#39;s the part where they are having an off the record meeting annually discussing how to manipulate the world.  Maybe, like they said with Iraq, they are pushing the Syrian situation for monetary/peto dollar policies and using the refugee crisis to creates to make social instability in Europe.  I don&#39;t know, but I definitely question it.</p>

Perhaps it&#39;s because those who were immediate survivors of WWII survivors have been dying off, perhaps it&#39;s just because they&#39;ve realized it&#39;s that much harder to convince people to abandon their cultures and nationalities so long as they protect the Israeli Jewish state. But I think the globalists are turning against Israel slowly, and will continue to do so. Some have started saying that Israel can not be both a democracy and a Jewish homeland, etc.</p>

<p>They&#39;ve gone all in on Islam for the tool to dismantle western states. It&#39;s a violent trans-national ideology that&#39;s very amenable to being ruled under tyranny.</p>

<p>No.  I don&#39;t believe any such thing.</p>

<p>The possibility that both may be wrong and that the real truth may lie somewhere else altogether never enters the debate and yet that almost always turns out to have been the case at some other and later point in time when and where it was least expected.

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>being thoroughly convinced about the reality of something is a very important topic, in and of itself and you can&#39;t actually separate it from &quot;knowing&quot;.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You can be thoroughly convinced of something which happens to be entirely false - in which case, it’s actually <em>not</em> knowledge even though it might involve quite a lot of belief.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What is more important? To believe what we know, or to know what we believe?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I would say it’s the former, as belief can be subject to falsity, while something that has proven itself to be actual knowledge (i.e. valid, factual data) is by its very nature <em>not</em> falsity.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Better still do we even know what we believe?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, one can, of course, postulate a type of relativism that qualifies all of existence and calls everything into question.  However, within the context of the perceived constancy of this third dimension as we understand it, it seems that it can indeed be said that there are things we can in fact “know”.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>How many things do we merely happen to believe simply as a result of being taught certain things in a certain way from a certain perspective; or simply inculcated to believe by an established culture and society we were merely born into that we have never at any time bothered to question before accepting and going along with because &quot;everyone else does, don&#39;t they?&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A lot, it seems.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>That&#39;s all extremely important in a forum such as this where &quot;the belief&quot; that there either was or had to be some other and alternate reality that actually took place or some other explanation for the actual events that did, than was actually and &quot;officially&quot; provided for it, is the prime driver behind why any of us are here and having these particular conversations.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Logical, critical thinking is an important component behind being able to sift the wheat from the chaff as it relates to proposing alternative theories to mainstream beliefs or perspectives, however.  Not all alternative perspectives are equal, after all.  Some alternative perspectives are quite sound and valid while others are rather devoid of merit or substance.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A belief that has a far stronger presence and reality in our own minds than all the so called &quot;evidence&quot; and the way it was subsequently interpreted and presented to us has.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is why critical thinking is so very important.  Critical thinking helps individuals discern which perspectives are more sound than others; which viewpoints are worthy of being pursued further and entertained, and which ones should be discarded.  If one is capable of discerning properly, then one can stave off merely believing in a thing with no evidence.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Evidence is only evidence&quot; it&#39;s existence may be factual but any of the so called facts that we or someone else &quot;gathers&quot; or is &quot;led to believe&quot; based simply and solely on the existence of that evidence is always subjective and always open to question.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Of course it is.  Correct.  However, if one has a particular subject that may not be conclusively resolved one way or the other, but has a great deal of evidence pointing in a particular direction, then one would be considerably foolish to not move in the direction that the evidence points.  In other words, although evidence is indeed subjective to a great extent, there absolutely <em>are</em> circumstances when the amount of evidence accumulated is sufficient to draw a correct conclusion upon.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We sometimes say &quot;it just doesn&#39;t feel right&quot; even though it may look or sound alright or &quot;good enough&quot; on the surface of it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here we are dealing with matters of the gross verses the fine.  In other words, there are dynamics that are readily discernible if the thing in question is more obvious, but the more detailed one gets into the minutia of the issue, the more difficult it gets to assess the validity of certain perspectives.  This is often why many say things are “good enough”.  It’s because the thing in question is fine on a “gross assessment” basis even though it may be found lacking upon “fine assessment”.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Sorry but there is no greater enemy of &quot;the good&quot; than that which is merely &quot;good enough&quot;.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>While I understand that it’s always better to work on a thing until one is thoroughly satisfied with the result, there are also times when the individual in question is unable to know <em>when</em> exactly that point is actually reached.  When this occurs, it actually isn’t a horrible idea to simply leave the issue as being “good enough”, since there is such a thing as overworking an issue.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Call it whatever you will, we suffer from some overpowering hunch, intuition, or nagging suspicion whose own reality in our minds is always stronger and refuses to be ignored or dismissed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I wouldn’t call it “suffering”.  I would say we’re “gifted” with the hunch.  That seeming sixth sense is a <em>good</em> thing, not a bad one.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Try as we might it keeps on coming back. We aren&#39;t being true to ourselves or honest with ourselves in attempting to accept what was given to us. Others may be but we aren&#39;t.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And that feeling isn’t necessarily “belief”.  It, in fact, can be just that:  A feeling - and the validity of certain feelings, especially if experienced before with positive results, can stretch beyond being categorized as a mere “belief”.</p>

<p>Perhaps this is being a bit pedantic at this point, however.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Our conscience demands something more from us before we can pass judgement and warns us that it is better to live with the uncertainty until we have enough we can truly be certain of whether we ever discover or encounter it or not.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I try to stay as far away from this uncertainty as possible.  I understand that there is a lot that we simply don’t know.  However, under those circumstances, I simply say “It seems to me that…” and leave it at that.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Our world isn&#39;t going to collapse or fall apart for the lack of it. Life will go on</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Certainly.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>our happy moments won&#39;t be diminished.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’m not sure that I would go that far, however, as one can certainly believe in the wrong thing and consequently get one’s happy moments <em>VERY</em> diminished as a result.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>One of the most important and truest statements William James makes in that treatise about the nature of belief and beliefs is that the opposite of &quot;belief&quot; is simply &quot;doubt&quot; and not &quot;disbelief&quot;.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I work on withholding my perspectives if I have either doubt or lack of understanding or knowledge of a thing - or at the very least I let it be known that what I’m saying, thinking, or feeling is only something that <em>seems</em> to be the case to me, but could be entirely incorrect.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>okay so full disclosure i am a member of an international fraternity, not the biggest but one of.</p>

<p>joining this during my college years is 100% the reason i am here. first off you are 100% right, but its not one its literally dozens of them. its a system, its not the masons, its not the rosicrucians, its not even the bohemian grover&#39;s its ALL OF THEM.</p>

<p>a good place to start philosophically is neitzsche, good and evil, and the concept of the higher man. this is what drives these guys, and i know many of them by way of the fraternity (again this is why i ended up coming here)</p>

<p>i was from a blue collar background and just happened to get lucky with a golden ticket, and was let in to this world.</p>

<p>the idea of the New world Order is old, like really fucking old, and that end state means almost as many different things as there are people pursuing it. each of them see it as their duty to bring that view of a utopia in to reality and so they lean on each other, and make deals to get closer to it.</p>

<p>this in of its self is not really sinister, or even a bad idea, the problem much like any system is in the actualization of that goal.</p>

<p>these sort of organizations attract psychopath/sociopaths like bees to flowers and that is the real danger, you have those people coming up with ideal worlds, who have no moral compass, and they are given access to large networks of people who have a tendency to share that same lack of empathy.</p>

<p>i dont believe there is one big multi tentacled singular society running things, just a collective of self serving sociopaths with access to a large network of more sociopaths all with their own little schemes helping each other out when it serves them.</p>

<p>in the end im sure there are a few top tier scumbags directing their power pyramids to do their will, but as far as it all being one big unified group i have my doubts (there are just too many sociopaths in the room for them to all agree to do one thing with out their own goals interfering)</p>

<p>in the end all they want is more power and control and they see themselves as the ones who should rightfully be the boss. every one knows a shadow of this, that one bossy person who always thinks they know better than everyone else (usually to a laughable degree) well, take that person and add being a sociopath, tons of influence (power or money) and you get 90% of the people who view themselves as &quot;the elite&quot;</p>

<p>the scariest part about these people is they actually think they are doing good by any means necessary....</p>

    <div class="md"><p>the people who really scare me are the ones who truly believe they are making the world a better places by enacting their vision of how the world should be. there is nothing more frightening than a true believer because there is nothing that will deter them.</p>

<p>i think sociopaths and psychopaths should be a much greater concern for people in general, that really is the common thread you see weaved between these &quot;elites&quot; that holds them together. </p>

<p>if you&#39;ve noticed a tendency for society to avoid dealing with mental illness i truly believe those same people are the reason. if we dig too deep in to the whole mental health thing it wouldn&#39;t be long before people are able to identify the sociopaths among us and send them in to treatment or single them out for what they are.</p>

<p>instead we&#39;ve allowed our society to pull towards that direction, rewarding these people with big money and positions of control.</p>

<p>one of the things i learned going through the whole college frat thing was if you want a good leader, under no circumstances let it be the person who WANTS it, the best leaders in my experience were the reluctant ones who were dragged to the throne kicking and screaming against their will lol.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe that a great many wealthy people are involved in any number of occult and secretive groups that engage in all kinds of strange, bizarre, perverse, decadent, and yes even depraved activities for wide variety of purposes and that some of those groups have actually existed for many long centuries with many members coming from the same powerful and influential families who have been involved in such activities for as long as they&#39;ve been around. </p>

<p>I can&#39;t say for sure but it seems entirely likely that they may in fact actually attribute the long lasting power and influence they&#39;ve managed to exert over others to some of those very activities.</p>

<p>Stop and consider what is known as &quot;heraldry&quot; with all of it&#39;s various signs, symbols, insignias, coats of arms, etc. originally used to denote the power and character of European aristocratic families and that came out into the open sometime in the 13th century. </p>

<p>The actual meaning and purpose of such signs and devices still remains virtually unknown to most of us. We are given a variety of explanations but they all fall short when it comes why such odd and strange representations would ever be created to denote what they supposedly do since those meanings are by no means obvious or decipherable just from looking at any of them. </p>

<p>That practice continues on in the insignias, logos, and seals of many powerful and influential corporations that all appear to pay tribute to some occult &quot;signs of power&quot; whose origins and whatever they genuinely meant or were used for has been lost in time as far as we&#39;re concerned.</p>

<p>When you take that into consideration and simply look around you it&#39;s plain that we&#39;re all walking around in the presence of something that we are completely oblivious to. </p>

<p>The open and unabashed  display of signs and symbols of some hidden and controlling power that may and most likely does go well beyond those signs or those who&#39;ve chosen to display and use them not so much to simply identify themselves, but to identify themselves with and as loyal agents of that power.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think that you can model the world this way.</p>

<p>At one end, the are those who have almost nothing. They have their own intelligence and talent, they have their health... and not much else.</p>

<p>At the other extreme, are those who have these same things... plus vast capital resources. </p>

<p>People with nothing can&#39;t exert much influence on others except for two ways. One is force of reason. Explain to your neighbor why you should be treated fairly (not equal, just fair). The second is the force of physical violence. e.g&#39;s are American and French revolutions.</p>

<p>Those with vast capital resources have more options to exert influence on others. They can use money to affect the political and legislative process. They can buy and control media resources to put out their narrative. They can pay for security forces (police, army) to keep everyone else in line.</p>

<p>So, at one end, not much... at the other, lot&#39;s of power. If you were to secretly observe 100 random people, you&#39;d find that most of them just want control over their own lives. A few of them won&#39;t give a fuck about anything. A few of them actively seek as much power as they can get.</p>

<p>This seems perfectly reasonable. So now when you talk about </p>

<blockquote>
<p>a secret society of wealthy people control the world and conspire together on how to further their agenda and control over the common people</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It doesn&#39;t seem so far out. Maybe there&#39;s an actual secret society, but you don&#39;t need this to explain how the world works. All you need is for the greediest, most selfish and power hungry to make it to the top and run everything in the way that benefits them the most.</p>

<p>So ordinary people who just want a good life and control over their own affairs (ie. independence) always have to put up with interference from the people at the top. If they can live a decent life with minimal interference, they&#39;re OK with that. </p>

<p>What it looks like these days is that the people at the top are starting to get out of control, wanting more wealth and more influence over the rest of us.</p>

<p>We&#39;ll see how long this can last.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Speaking of leaving subliminal messages through media outlets. Chances are it is their way of warning humanity about their existence. There are many ways to look at it and one of them is that the &#39;illuminated ones&#39; are throwing signs at us to warn about certain things. They keep away esoterical knowledge from society. Imo if sacred knowledge was handed to humanity it would destroy itself. So lets be honest, they might be doing this for a greater good. </p>

<p>Once we start getting our &#39;&#39;collective thinking&#39;&#39; straight, changes will happen overnight! And the best thing is, it doesn&#39;t need everyone to agree, just the &#39;square root&#39; of the number of people involved ... which for 7billion people is only a few hundred million of us need to be Red Pilled, &#39;awake&#39; and in agreement about &#39;&#39;what needs to change AND what will replace it&#39;&#39; ,, for major changes to begin to happen!</p>

<p>A world with nobody in charge likely seems like a scary fucking place to them as well.  So I&#39;m sure they try to be in charge, try to run things and slowly make the world into whatever they think is a better place.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No is the short answer. Yes the media is controlled by the rich and powerful. Yes the political parties like to keep us divided.

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think the world is &#39;controlled&#39; I think rich people have common interests that causes them to act in concert, but with minimal direction or coordination.</p>

<p>There is not a group of Satan worshiping, child fuckers secretly playing with human society for some nefarious purpose. There are greedy, lustful, and evil people manipulating others for their own good.</p>

<p>Most conspiracies are bunk, but many are real. Those that are real are largely carried out by governments, sometimes with other organizations involved. Most of these conspiracies are about advancing ideologies at any cost. </p>

<p>Numerology, aliens, lizard people, etc are rantings of the mentally ill. Government surveillance, experiments, casual disregard for human life are real. Millitarys and intelligence agencies generally act in the national interests of the nations they are associated with. Sometimes, perhaps most of the time, without regard for basic human decency. They often do so in secrecy, for operational reasons. These two facts combined, Secrecy and Unethical behavior lead to the &#39;conspiracies&#39; we see in the world.  Often those conspiracies are actually just hubris and incompetence.</p>

<p>There is no Illuminati, the bohemian grove is a boys club for rich people, George Soros is just a rich guy with a political agenda... Hillary isn&#39;t a lizard, she just kinda sucks. Trump isn&#39;t a hero or villain, he is just a bit of an idiot, wars happen for economic reasons and are often sold to the public as &#39;moral.&#39;</p>

<p>Exposing the behavior of bad people is good. We should all strive to remain, skeptical, rational, and considerate.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>God fucking damn, I&#39;m so sick of people in this sub being <em>so close</em> to realizing that the problems facing society stem from capitalism itself, yet being so far away. </p>

<p>Every day there are posts about &quot;the bankers&quot; or &quot;Wall Street&quot; (hint: <em>finance capital</em>) or media conglomerates (hint: <em>capitalist owners</em> utilize the media for their own purposes) or Agribusiness (hint: insane levels of capital accumulation have given ridiculous power to companies like Monsanto, Nestle, Kraft, etc). While you&#39;re all shrieking about the plastic in the water and the poison in our food and air you might want to think about the <em>systemic issues</em> which <em>allow those things to happen.</em></p>

<p>Top post in here is about Bilderberg, but it&#39;s not a bunch of spooky old people in their wizard&#39;s caps and robes doing this shit. Kill everyone at Bilderberg and what will you get? Given enough time, <em>a new Bilderberg</em>. A <em>new illuminati</em>. </p>

<p>You know why? Because collusion among the rich and powerful makes them all richer and their power more secure. It&#39;s almost like they&#39;re part of the same fucking class and have interests in common aligned against the rest of us. </p>

<p>It&#39;s not like this is a fucking secret either, but I guess this sort of ignorance is happens when you reflexively and emotionally recoil from any criticism of <em>the ruling class ideology- capitalism- even in the face of that ruling class&#39;s abuse</em>. So many dig their heads in the sand, so many arguments I&#39;ve had with idiots literally stating &quot;capitalism is freedom&quot; unaware that they&#39;re not making an argument but rather spewing ideology. Even as those same idiots pile in to whatever post of the day highlights whatever new fucked up shit our class masters have perpetrated in order to express their outrage against it. </p>

<p>And before anybody pulls some strawman bullshit about muh tyranny, </p>

<p>1) LightbringerFlex gets hundreds of upvotes almost every time he posts his vaguely socialistic gift economy crap. These ideas are popular, even here, but once you frame them in <em>terms</em> like capitalism, socialism, they are met with a pretty emotional response. Maybe you should reflect a bit on what that means. </p>

<p>2) Libertarian socialism is a thing. No, it&#39;s not an oxymoron, you&#39;re just ignorant. Try looking it up. Try asking yourself &quot;why would the powers that be want to make this more widely known? Is there advantage to their position in attempting to frame a false dichotomy between runaway capitalism (which favors their position) or government-owns-everything socialism (which does the same)?&quot;</p>

<p>If my post sounds mad it&#39;s because I am, I don&#39;t know how else to feel to see a group of people so close to the realization of truth yet see it held from them by such a paper thin membrane of false consciousness. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can appreciate your frustration but the main problem regarding some more fair and equitable plan or system to replace what we have and that can&#39;t be similarly compromised and corrupted by a few rotten apples still hasn&#39;t been found. </p>

<p>Without some intelligent and logical replacement that meets that criteria there is no impetus and really no reason for attempting to diverge and break-away from the existing system no matter how bad it is or gets.</p>

<p>You have to have some viable and sustainable way for people to disengage from the one system to embrace a more completely fair and equitable one in it&#39;s place in a way that would make it nigh unto impossible for the arch-capitalists to ever stop or prevent it.</p>

<p>One that&#39;s successful enough to create a mass exodus from their thoroughly contrived, corrupt and self-serving economic system.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s one of the better ones that never actually gained any traction but it addresses any number of issues that still remain hidden from the vast majority of people.

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d say that much of the same groups that controlled trade in the 1600&#39;s are still at it. Basically organizations that started out as pirates or highwaymen (your typical organized crime, no less), but later coming to some agreements, and eventually legitimized as merchant associations and later on into government banking. What could be seen as the very first pay-to-play scheme in effect, either through insurance or some other toll or tax agreement with such organizations. The ones still calling the shots now still have ties to them. From Europe it&#39;d be Dutch, Swiss, Corsican, and Cicilian organizations. Then there&#39;s the lower Mediterranean and mideastern. (Some will claim that one is Zionist, but that alliance is spread out more than just Israel.) And then you have Silk Road and East Asian groups.</p>

<p>Most of the time the interests of these cabals do align, but sometimes you get a real shit-show or major conflicts when they don&#39;t. And some in the fray will often play more than one side.</p>

<p>OP can you explain HOW in your personal belief system they would accomplish that? In this secret society theory you are proposing, HOW would they (the wealthy secretive people) be able to plan something DECADES in advance? I feel like there are way too many variables to be able to accomplish something like that. Or another question would be HOW are they (wealthy secretive people) that much smarter than the rest of us? To be able to plan events out in decades you would have to have the wool pulled over nearly EVERYONE&#39;S eyes. </p>

<p>What&#39;s really fucking crazy is that if your belief is right, our entire lives have been a lie and society is a complete work of fiction. </p>

<p>Looking forward to your response OP. </p>

<p>The bad guys are basically <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL11E33A6AEEB2674F">Freemasonry</a> which also includes the Jesuits, secret policy groups like the Council on Foreign Relations, the intelligence agencies, etc.</p>

<p>The good guys are led by an organization that calls themselves <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5ee4wk/updated_for_anyone_interested_in_high_level/?ref=search_posts">Three</a>. They were behind Athenian Democracy, the Roman Republic, and the American Revolution. These are huge red pills, let me know if you have any questions.</p>
