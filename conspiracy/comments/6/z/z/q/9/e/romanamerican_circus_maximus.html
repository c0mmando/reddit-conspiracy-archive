        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The national sports teams in the NFL, MLB, and NBA are part of the control system. They are ran by corrupt billionaires who rig the sporting events and create idols. Sports are propped up for entertainment and used as distractions in society similar to ancient Roman gladiator fights at the Colleseum and chariot races at the Circus Maximus. Sports are often used to distract from the political corruption. Many athletes are criminals and the most popular athletes are the ones who sell out and can be used as idols for promoting political agendas. For instance LeBron James is known for supporting Barack Obama and his agendas. Aaron Hernandez played for the New England Patriots and was convicted of murder. Many football players are involved in crime to the extent that there seems to be a violent criminal organization tied in with the NFL. OJ Simpson is another criminal and former football player that has spent 9 years in prison for armed robbery. Former NFL player Lawrence Taylor has been arrested numerous times for drugs and plead guilty to sexual misconduct with an underage prostitute. Former NFL player Michael Bennett was arrested for wire fraud and stealing several hundred thousand in cash. Former NFL player Irving Fryar was convicted or mortgage fraud. The former New England Patriot Jimmy Hitchcock was convicted of mortgage fraud conspiracy, bank bribery conspiracy and money laundering conspiracy.</p>

<p>Robert Kraft is the owner of the New England Patriots and worth over 4 billion. He is the founder and the Chairman of Kraft Group which is involved with real estate, investments, sports and manufacturing. Robert Kraft is a Zionist businessman involved in manufacturing plants and financing sports in Israel. Kraft and his wife have also donated to College of the Holy Cross and Boston College for Judaic studies and both colleges are Jesuit universities. His son Jonathan Kraft is President of Kraft Group and the New England Patriots. Woody Johnson is the owner of the New York Jets and a multi billionaire whose family created Johnson &amp; Johnson. Woody Johnson is the US Ambassador to the United Kingdom. The Johnson family are from New Brunswick New Jersey named after Brunswick Germany which was ruled by the House of Hanover. Han in Hanover is short for Johannes the German version of the name John. The Johnson family are relatives of the House of Hanover which are closely related with the House of Windsor and they rule the United Kingdom. This is why Woody Johnson was appointed by Donald Trump to be the Ambassador to the UK. The Johnson family are believed to be worth around 6 billion and the family also founded the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation a health group with 9 billion in assets. Many charitable foundations do the opposite of what they claim to do. John W. Henry is worth about 2 billion and owns the Boston Red Sox and his partner Tom Werner the Chairman of the Red Sox is close friends with the Bill and Hillary Clinton. John Mara is co owner of the New York Giants and was Jesuit educated at Fordham University and Boston College.</p>

<p>Sports are heavily fixed including in the MLB, NFL, NBA, and NABC. The earliest known example was the Black Sox Scandal with the mobster Arnold Rothstein paying off White Sox players to throw the World Series so Rothstein and his mafia associates could win their fixed bets. This still goes on today and not only do the mafia use pay offs but also threats to get players to fix games. This is even more common in boxing and in mixed martial arts. These fights often take place in Las Vegas Nevada which was built up by the Chicago Outfit. The Nevada Athletic Commission oversees and manages these fights and has been infiltrated by the mob. They issue licenses for fights and appoint the referees and judges. Anthony Marnell III is the Chairman for the Nevada Athletic Commission today. This commission can ban fighters so it is another avenue for them to control the fights. The Italian Mafia are also known for fixing soccer matches in Italy all the time. They make tens of millions a year fixing sporting events. Businessmen work with the mafia which have a willingness to use violence. In many cases businessmen like team owners are front men for the mafia. The mafia finds someone with a clean background and prop them up while they operate covertly as their enforcers and deal with their competitors. Their front man businessmen then enable crimes like fixing sports.</p>

<p>Ran, is the past tense of the verb &quot;to run&quot;, run is not used in combination with another verb. It is used alone to describe the action. Run, when used as the past tense, can be used with a form of the verb &quot;to be&quot;. Therefore your sentence should read, &quot;They are run by...&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The basis for claiming ran is past tense is the act of moving ones legs like running or he ran a mile which is an established act with a defined beginning and end. This type of running is not synonymous with running or controlling a company. &quot;He controlled a mile&quot; makes no sense. Again I would argue that ran infers I am speaking presently in the moment and not speaking for the future. If I put they run the companies it would imply continual. For instance if someone reads the post after these people retired or sold these companies it would not be accurate. The way I worded it was as if it is in the moment. </p>

<p>I am not aware of your Theism, but I would suggest the idea that the hack mechanism can be done through spirit in a determined and righteous intent by the hand of G.  I would know.  I hope you do too.  The key is - artificial vs. natural and one is Truth and one is False - G is Truth and the source of all power.  They lock mechanism is goodness - locking out evil ( rather than a masterlock with a googleplex number system - even that is not secure ).  Merely decoding what they have done using their own decoder-ring ( so to speak ) will only yield an awareness of knowledge - not a change in reality itself.  This is how to conduct the warfare.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If baffles me, that people think the world has changed since the Roman times. Nothing has changed, simply just re-branded or re-worded. Gladiator fights were notorious for being rigged, for various reasons, and usually for x,y,and z. Money, popular support, political means, etc etc. How people do not see this in modern times, truly baffles me. Same players, same controllers, same tactics, different wording and execution. Great post, once again!</p>

You can make a shit ton of money if you know the winner to each season. Doesn&#39;t matter which sport it is.</p>

<p>You mentioned MLB, NFL, NBA but those are not the only ones. Look at the Olympics, they are always full of shit. Look at FIFA, completely corrupted and full of shit. Some major e-Sports are corrupt af! Tour de France used to be full of cheaters.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Right! Blanketing all sports as fixed? 90% of the guys in the mlb, nfl, nba are trying to keep that million dollar job they just landed. Like, a 23 year old pitcher will not be walking the yard to give away the win..... because he will be cut and lose his job.  Probably end up as a pitching coach for a rural travel ball team of 14 year old kids, for 35k a year. Hmmmm... any logic here?</p>
