       I'm not much of a conspiracist but I was watching Comedy Central last night and they had an ad on about "full frontal with Samantha bee" I honestly have no opinion on the show but when I saw the ad there was a quote about how it was the best late night show on tv. So I checked who the source was and it was tvonline.com I've never heard of them and every time I try googling them it just shows random shit but not tvonline.com. So please answer

       Your answer is as follows.  You are a prisoner mentally to not only yourself, but every box that you have in your life and you and most everyone else is completely oblivious and ignorant to it.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can't find the website you are looking for because they made the shit up.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why did they make the shit up? Because everyone but you did not to go and check its validity.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why would the tv lie to you?

       You now have a purpose in life to figure out how much of your reality that you perceive is actually reality at all.

       But how can they quote something like that? Without a source. I know it's pedantic but it just seems weird they would broadcast such a weird source.

       Well, tvonline is clearly some sub standard agency (not sure if they even produce original content) so it would make sense that they are more than happy to sell reviews. 
Whoever works in the marketing department of CC either knows somebody there (kickback) or just thought the name sounded good enough (like something local) and their prices were fine.

       The majority of quotes or blurbs are paid for, even from reputable sources.

       Your answer is as follows. You are a prisoner mentally to not only yourself, but every box that you have in your life and you and most everyone else is completely oblivious and ignorant to it.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can't find the website you are looking for because they made the shit up.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why did they make the shit up? Because everyone but you did not to go and check its validity.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why would the tv lie to you?
      </p>
      <p>
       You now have a purpose in life to figure out how much of your reality that you perceive is actually reality at all.

       That was actually kind of hard to read, but I completely agree with you. Btw I really respect how you don't beat around the bush and gave a real answer without being too much of an asshole. Thanks for the reply.

       Drunk, stoned and on ghb trying to answer.  Usually leaves my thoughts abstract AF so writing them out takes significantly longer.

       I went and cleaned it up a bit :)

       I have a spade tattooed on me for a reason. I don't bullshit. Life has too much of it everywhere we look. Finding honest entities is few and far between.

       I wouldn't say I'm going ape shit. I just saw something and thought I would bring it up to this sub. I've got my answers and I thank those people for providing me one, but why is it that so many of you are so triggered all the time. Like this was a pretty fucking simple question and most of the replies are "hur dur figure it out" like go fuck yourself with that attitude you virgins, like who really gets so defensive about a post that they literally only think I'm just noticing false advertising. What the media is doing is pretty shitty, but you people on this sub really suck ass for getting so condescending over a simple post. Go outside and start realizing not everything is as polarizing as you people on this sub make it out to be. It's not Armageddon it's 2017, grow the fuck up.

       Do yourself a favor: turn off your TV and never turn it back on again.  I guarantee you will be happier, smarter, more free thinking, less desensitized, and after a few months you'll be shocked you ever watched it in the first place.
