        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;m not much of a conspiracist but I was watching Comedy Central last night and they had an ad on about &quot;full frontal with Samantha bee&quot; I honestly have no opinion on the show but when I saw the ad there was a quote about how it was the best late night show on tv. So I checked who the source was and it was tvonline.com I&#39;ve never heard of them and every time I try googling them it just shows random shit but not tvonline.com. So please answer </p>

<p>Edit. Changed now to not.</p>

<p>But how can they quote something like that? Without a source. I know it&#39;s pedantic but it just seems weird they would broadcast such a weird source.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, tvonline is clearly some sub standard agency (not sure if they even produce original content) so it would make sense that they are more than happy to sell reviews. 
Whoever works in the marketing department of CC either knows somebody there (kickback) or just thought the name sounded good enough (like something local) and their prices were fine. </p>

<p>The majority of quotes or blurbs are paid for, even from reputable sources. </p>

I&#39;ve got my answers and I thank those people for providing me one, but why is it that so many of you are so triggered all the time. Like this was a pretty fucking simple question and most of the replies are &quot;hur dur figure it out&quot; like go fuck yourself with that attitude you virgins, like who really gets so defensive about a post that they literally only think I&#39;m just noticing false advertising. What the media is doing is pretty shitty, but you people on this sub really suck ass for getting so condescending over a simple post. Go outside and start realizing not everything is as polarizing as you people on this sub make it out to be. It&#39;s not Armageddon it&#39;s 2017, grow the fuck up.</p>
