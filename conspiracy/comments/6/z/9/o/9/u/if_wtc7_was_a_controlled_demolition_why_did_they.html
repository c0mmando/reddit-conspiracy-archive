        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>After reading into it for many hours and listening to the University of Alaska presentation, I am entirely convinced that tower 7 was not brought down by fire.  IF it was controlled demolition, why was it necessary to do it this way by whoever was calling the shots?  I&#39;m trying to imagine the scenario..  </p>

<p>Two planes successfully bring down the twin towers, the elite warmongers are cracking open their champaign, and one of them pipes up, &quot;Hey, let&#39;s finish the job!  Tell them to pull it for tower 7&quot;.  Continued cheering continues as Podesta shows up with pizza.</p>

<p>Unfortunately I can&#39;t wrap my head around what motive there could have been there.  Why didn&#39;t they just say &quot;okay, that was some serious shit we pulled there, let&#39;s fuck off to our private islands for awhile now while we tell Bush to invade Iraq&quot;.  What was the point of bringing down that one smaller building?</p>

<p>That&#39;s a key element that seems to not be brought up in discussions of wtc7 and I think it&#39;s quite important.    </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting.. but they use the word &quot;claim&quot; as if conspiracy theorists aren&#39;t flexible with their thinking.  I think for the most part we do a good job at stepping back and looking at the entire picture, rather than MSM tunnelvision</p>

<p>Aside from not being able to spell very easy words... you suck. You are in no position to even consider someone else to be rude.</p>

<p>Here are just a few....</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Better not respond. Otherwise everting you said previously goes out the theoritical window. That mean&#39;s it&#39;s fake dumbass!</p></li>
<li><p>Down voted because fuck you ;). And better not respond otherwise your a dishonest asshole.</p></li>
<li><p>How can you think it (you&#39;re) you fucking idiot? Holy shot you stupid people amaze me. And stop being so angry ;)</p></li>
<li><p>Didn&#39;t expect to say gaaaaaaay and not mean it. But seriously gay AF!!!!</p></li>
<li><p>Downvoted because why not?</p></li>
<li><p>Wow can&#39;t believe OP tried to kill his brother. Maybe stop browsing r/conspiracy?</p></li>
<li><p>How has this comment chain got this long without any of you fucking idiots answering the question.</p></li>

The destruction of the two towers was the shock and awe part, and I&#39;m sure that amid all that chaos as they came down WTC7 was supposed to come down too, but something went wrong, so they improvised and waited, so they could use the fires as an excuse.</p>
