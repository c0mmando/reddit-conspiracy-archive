    <div class="md"><p>Hey Putincat, sorry to hijack your top comment but I feel like people should be warned against rallying at One World Trade Center areas without proper planning.</p>

<p>Here are the rules for the 9/11 memorial an parks areas: <a href="https://www.911memorial.org/visitor-rules-and-regulations">https://www.911memorial.org/visitor-rules-and-regulations</a></p>

<p>The rules specifically outlaw any leaflets or protests. Creepily, just in case they want to arrest anyone, they (paraphrasing) outlaw anyone making facial expressions that may be deemed as drawing attention.</p>

<p>I&#39;m all for getting the word out on 9/11 lies, but I also don&#39;t want any good hearted but ignorant protestor getting arrested. I&#39;m pretty sure most New Yorkers know about the OTC and 9/11 memorial security tho and wouldn&#39;t fall for this.</p>

<p>Within minutes of the first air strike on the World Trade Center September 11, 2001, an NYPD Bell 412 helicopter with a 250 foot hoist and a three man crew trained for rooftop rescues, piloted by Detective Greg Semendinger arrived at the WTC.</p>

<p>In 1993 after a bomb exploded in the WTC basement garage sending thick smoke up through the stairwells, Semendinger had lowered two men to the roof of the same North Tower, who removed antennas to clear a landing area from which twenty eight workers were airlifted to safety.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Notwithstanding any other facts or evidence S remains culpable for refusing to deploy the trained rooftop rescue team that day, to free those trapped behind locked fire doors directly after the first strike at 8:47 am, the North Tower went down at 10:28 am he had plenty of time .. sod him! <a href="http://www.dockersunion.net/vb/showthread.php?6-The-Most-Shameful-Act-on-a-Day-of-Shame!&amp;amp;p=6#post6">The Most Shameful Act on a Day of Shame!</a>.</p>

<p>The Talmud: &quot;If you see a Christian in difficulty or drowning do not go to his help, and if he is in danger of death do not save him,&quot; the lack of effort was Jews responding to the mores of Judah.</p>

<p>Semendinger should be prosecuted as a capital offender for making no effort to save them, his arrest should be at the Precinct House where the rest of New York&#39;s foulest in situ will be required to disarm, while any that don&#39;t will be regarded as enemy combatants! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You edited that Talmud line </p>

<p>The line does not say Christian because Christian never appears in any line in the Talmud since Christians did not exist at the time of its compiling.</p>

<p>The term Christian was created after the conversion of Constantine to Christianity, which at that time was just an off shoot of Judaism. Constantine compiled the Christian church and bible and most of the terms</p>

<p>The word that was used was &quot;Goyim&quot; which in ancient Hebrew means Idol worshippers. The line from the Talmud makes more sense in that context since idol worship is against the 10 commandments.</p>

<p>But it&#39;s still no perfect sell.  However, there are some related things that happened right after.  &quot;IRAQ HAZ WMDS!&quot;</p>

<p>We know this to be false and lied about.  No question.</p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/soohikNdbWs?t=16">https://youtu.be/soohikNdbWs?t=16</a> Bush says no WMDs. <a href="https://youtu.be/eHDDQVZ-A98?list=RDhxjtOKFErRA&amp;amp;t=456">https://youtu.be/eHDDQVZ-A98?list=RDhxjtOKFErRA&amp;amp;t=456</a> Rumsfeld says same.</p>

<p>We went to iraq, slaughtered many innocent people over lies, and still to this day we occupy Afghanistan.  These are actionable ideas.  Our dead military men and the innocents we slaughtered in those nations.  <a href="https://youtu.be/3NCLfhmWvJ8">https://youtu.be/3NCLfhmWvJ8</a></p>

<p>This too is worthy of action and holds present day consequences.  We may one day find opportunity for justice concerning 9/11, but their propaganda against 9/11 is hard to beat.  Not trying to stop you from protesting.  I am saying if people like you and I want justice and action, I know of a path that we can walk if we are passionate and dedicated about.</p>

<p>This is the short of it, this effects the entire world from pole to pole.</p>

<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/eoChcXj.png">http://i.imgur.com/eoChcXj.png</a> This is the illegal usury that enslaves and oppressed Americans, this wealth (over a trillion a year) goes directly to the owners of the federal reserve. This makes them the unseen oligarchy of the USA. This is why the .1% are so insanely wealthy and have more wealth than the bottom 90% combined.  Nearly every nation on Earth has a central private bank.</p>

<p>On the platform of ending pointless wars, innocent deaths and 16 year occupations we can make efforts to end the federal reserve, IRS, federal income tax, and re-claim our stolen wealth.  One time wealth re-distribution followed by voting out the entire government at last and getting justice and answers.  This doesn&#39;t end here this, the objective is to do the same for places like mexico and beyond.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yep.  The Federal Reserve needs to be properly addressed.  Well, realistically, the real battle has always been consciousness expansion.  And with the States legalizing marijuana, victory on all fronts seems ensured.  All we gotta do is field a team and, run the ball, play defense, and we&#39;re gonna win.  So join me you bastard.  Protest on 9/11.  Field a team.  And run for office.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Doesn&#39;t matter who runs for office now.  Unless you had absolutely -everyone- replaced simultaneously, they will bribe, hire, intimidate, murder or buy the small number of individuals you may actually succeed in changing.  The problem is the world bankers immense wealth and the already huge existing number of incumbents.</p>

<p>Nothing changes without the federal reserve gone.</p>

<p>I have much to say on the election system and voting being massive issues within them selves, but the federal reserve is the crown here and on the back of ending war and removing out enslavement we can unify many.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Will you tell passers by about Israel&#39;s apparent role in the attack?</p>

<p>911 was a cheap magic trick - only bad magicians use CG. Want proof that CG footage was used?</p>

<p>A Pentagon employee crawled through the hole and saw no evidence of a plane:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIy9hjB3DGk">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIy9hjB3DGk</a></p>

<p>Major General Stubblebine confirms that the wreckage at the pentagon is consistent with a missile and not a plane:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jc1ql4TfCZw">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jc1ql4TfCZw</a></p>

<p>This WTC witness insists it was a bomb, no plane:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bq1-BCeNcm0">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bq1-BCeNcm0</a></p>

<p>These firemen said they counted 3 explosions. The Police/FBI are reported to have attributed this to vans with explosives in the WTC basement:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfxkcBmZfK0">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfxkcBmZfK0</a></p>

<p>You can also see raw footage (ie. not altered to show a CG plane) that shows the missile impacting the WTC (no plane):</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wF74zTLjNg">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wF74zTLjNg</a></p>

<p>You can see a comparison showing the NBC footage showing no plane was digitally altered to show a plane (as well as adjust the colors to make the buildings appeared white and sky blue for increased psychological impact):</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPKq2K2dh6k">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPKq2K2dh6k</a></p>

<p>The altered footage in some cases is obviously fake, for example tiling smoke:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkzfKRe0gbc">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkzfKRe0gbc</a></p>

<p>But what wasn&#39;t CG was the explosions and the plane cutout shape they created. You can see those small explosions here (6 minute mark):</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rT1z90BB8E4&amp;amp;feature=endscreen&amp;amp;NR=1">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rT1z90BB8E4&amp;amp;feature=endscreen&amp;amp;NR=1</a></p>

<p>The cutting charges were planted by Israeli Mossad posing as art students who rented a whole floor and got construction permits at the site, and made a temporary balcony. They even made a book about their &quot;art&quot; - which showed them standing next to boxes and boxes of explosives fuses in the WTC!</p>

<p><a href="http://winteractionables.com/?p=25207">http://winteractionables.com/?p=25207</a></p>

<p>Mossad agents filmed the missile impacts/explosions (to add CG planes later and pass on to media) and later went up to the roof to plant radio jamming devices. They were arrested and this is documented by the FBI. There was traces of explosives in their van and they were set up filming BEFORE the attack:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.scribd.com/collections/4010452/9-11-The-Dancing-Israelis-FBI-report">https://www.scribd.com/collections/4010452/9-11-The-Dancing-Israelis-FBI-report</a></p>

<p>Let me stress that again, the FBI arrested dancing Israelis on 911, not muslims. They refused to take lie detector tests for months, and when they did, they failed. So much of that FBI report is redacted, proof positive of guilt.</p>

<p>They needed to fake plane impacts because a real plane would be shredded by the WTC like cheese through a grater. That&#39;s why when the Transasia plane collided with a taxi, the wing broke off, and the taxi wasn&#39;t sliced in half at all:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQ29Zr7wWnw">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQ29Zr7wWnw</a></p>

<p>According to a WTC architect in a 80s interview, the impact of a plane (300 tonnes) is nothing compared to the 13,000 tonnes of force trying to push the WTC over simply because of its enormous surface area.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E15GbdVaV-Q">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E15GbdVaV-Q</a></p>

<p>WTC project management engineer atttests the buildings could survive multiple plane impacts.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fQlC2AIWrY">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fQlC2AIWrY</a></p>

<p>The WTC designers did a study for 600mph-1 impact which showed the towers would easily withstand the 911 attack.</p>

<p><a href="http://911research.wtc7.net/wtc/analysis/design.html">http://911research.wtc7.net/wtc/analysis/design.html</a></p>

<p>Someone planted an engine (though wrong make) to further the plane deception:</p>

<p><a href="/r/conspiracy/comments/34o4y0/911_engine_that_shot_out_of_the_south_tower_was/">/r/conspiracy/comments/34o4y0/911_engine_that_shot_out_of_the_south_tower_was/</a></p>

<p>Essentially the media got punked by Israel, because journalists just report what they&#39;re told. You can see another example of newscasters being fooled by a movie set into thinking it&#39;s a real plane accident. At the 7 minute mark in this video:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wozTHxykDwQ">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wozTHxykDwQ</a></p>

<p>The larger 911 plan required the destruction of the Washington bridge and Lincoln tunnel. That would take out the fiber optic cables linked to stock market/banking, markets would have crashed and there would be martial law introduced. You can see this TV report on the other Israeli vans that were intercepted, one of them exploded:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmpWe2Rhi_I">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmpWe2Rhi_I</a></p>

<p>Israeli companies moved out of the building months before the attack. Israelis in America were warned in advance through an Israeli messaging service:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.haaretz.com/odigo-says-workers-were-warned-of-attack-1.70579">http://www.haaretz.com/odigo-says-workers-were-warned-of-attack-1.70579</a></p>

<p>Hundreds of Israelis were flown out of America, despite a flight ban, to avoid them being arrested by the FBI, including the &quot;art students&quot;:</p>

<p>Israel is the almost only country that benefited from the September 11 th attacks. In the words of Netanyahu, &quot;it&#39;s good for Israel&quot;.</p>

<p>If self-immolation is not eye-catching enough for a protester to be noticed maybe we should just realize that protests don&#39;t really work.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Mossad and its American associates are the obvious culprits. Who benefits from the crime? The attacks against the twin towers started at 8:45 a.m. and four flights are diverted from their assigned air space and no air traffic controller sounds the alarm. And no Air Force jets scramble until 10 a.m. That also smacks of a small scale Air Force rebellion, a coup against the Pentagon perhaps? Radars are jammed, transponders fail. No IFF -- friend or foe identification -- challenge. In Pakistan, if there is no response to IFF, jets are instantly scrambled and the aircraft is shot down with no further questions asked. This was clearly an inside job. Bush was afraid and rushed to the shelter of a nuclear bunker. He clearly feared a nuclear situation. Who could that have been? Will that also be hushed up in the investigation, like the Warren report after the Kennedy assassination?</p>

<p>The whole world already knows this. This is a simple restatement of what everybody already knows.</p>

<p>Everywhere except in America, where Jewish dominated media envelops everyone in a poisoned darkness, everybody knows that Jewish kingpins pulled off 9/11 as an excuse for making war on every obstacle to their world financial hegemony, and killing as many non-Jews as possible in the process to further consolidate their domination of the whole world.</p>

<p>This widening war on the Islamic world, already responsible for millions of unnecessary deaths, is a direct result of the 9/11 hoax, everything based on false spin concocted by Jewish strategists not for U.S. best interests, but for the demonic master plan of the Jewish Sanhedrin, which rules the Jewish moneymen who buy the presidents and the generals, to kill or enslave the rest of the world. They control you, whether you want to admit or not. They control your bank account. And they make you support their insane war program by all this wall-to-wall patriotic spin.</p>

<p>The totally Jewish-controlled U.S. media have long ago suspended their journalistic capabilities in favor of blatant cheerleading about their favorite subject - Muslim terrorists. Every day they urge you to kill them. If there ever was a systemic hate crime, this is it.</p>

<p>Yet, as the infamous list of the 19 hijackers was released by the FBI two days after the infamous event, and except for two feeble-minded patsies, no other perpetrator has ever been arrested for the greatest crime in American history, what kind of conclusions are we to draw from the fact that all of the people who were in charge of America when this dark day happened, instead of being fired for incompetence, were promoted and allowed to continue their criminal activity?</p>

<p>What does all this say about the American mind?</p>

<p>It is not functioning, thanks to the poisoned blanket of U.S. media, and a deliberately twisted educational system that has produced killer Jewish robots instead of fully invested philosophically clean humans.</p>

<p>Every cop in the world should be brought up on charges of willful obstruction of justice for not blowing the whistle on President George Bush, Vice President Dick Cheney, and all their Jewish handlers - in the White House, in the Congress, in the media, and most especially in the banks) for their stunningly criminal behavior in both lying about the events and implementing a totally illegal coverup of the crime scenes.</p>

<p>But the Jewish judges atop the U.S. legal system said it was all OK, and the media, led by the New York Times and CNN, never mentioned all those Jewish fingerprints visible in the pyroclastic dust covering the disintegrated corpses in the rubble of the Twin Towers.</p>

<p>In an interview only a mere weeks after 9/11, Hamid Gul - former head of Pakistani intelligence (ISI) from 1987-1989 - told Arnaud de Borchgrave, United Press International, of who he thinks was behind the attacks. Here are a few exceprts from the transcript:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>De Borchgrave: So who did Black Sept. 11?</p>

<p>Gul: Mossad and its accomplices. The U.S. spends $40 billion a year on its 11 intelligence agencies. That&#39;s $400 billion in 10 years. Yet the Bush Administration says it was taken by surprise. I don&#39;t believe it. Within 10 minutes of the second twin tower being hit in the World Trade Center CNN said Osama bin Laden had done it. That was a planned piece of disinformation by the real perpetrators. It created an instant mindset and put public opinion into a trance, which prevented even intelligent people from thinking for themselves.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Immediately after the attacks Bin Laden was interviewed by Pakistani newspaper Ummat. When asked if he was involved in the attacks he stated:</p>

<p>&quot;I have already said that I am not involved in the 11 September attacks in the United States. As a Muslim, I try my best to avoid telling a lie. I had no knowledge of these attacks, nor do I consider the killing of innocent women, children and other humans as an appreciable act. Islam strictly forbids causing harm to innocent women, children and other people. Such a practice is forbidden even in the course of a battle.&quot;</p>

<p>He went on to say:</p>

<p>&quot;In the same way, whether it is President Bush or any other U.S. President, they cannot bring Israel to justice for its human rights abuses or to hold it accountable for such crimes. What is this? Is it not that there exists a government within the government in the United States? That secret government must be asked as to who carried out the attacks.&quot;</p>

<p>He further goes on to state:</p>

<p>&quot;I have already said that we are not hostile to the United States. We are against the [U.S. Government] system, which makes other nations slaves of the United States, or forces them to mortgage their political and economic freedom. This system is totally in the control of the American Jews, whose first priority is Israel, not the United States. It is clear that the American people are themselves the slaves of the Jews and are forced to live according to the principles and laws laid down by them. So the punishment should reach Israel. In fact, it is Israel, which is giving a blood bath to innocent Muslims and the U.S. is not uttering a single word.&quot;</p>

<p>You know all this is true. You know you are living a lie every day, by accepting what the TV robots tell you is true.</p>

<p>Yet you wring your hands and kvetch that you don&#39;t know what to do, when in fact you do. You just don&#39;t have the courage to do it, because you&#39;re a robotized American dreckdroid, who goes out and kills other people for reasons simply because you have been ordered to by those who control you. Despicable. You are despicable, because you don&#39;t have the courage to say what you clearly know, even though you about to lose everything you ever loved because of your failure to say what you know and confront the beast. And now it&#39;s too big to stop.</p>
