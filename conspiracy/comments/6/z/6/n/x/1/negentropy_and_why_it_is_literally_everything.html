       Negentropy is a scientific measure of complexity and order. It is the opposite of entropy, which is a measure of chaos and disorder.
      </p>
      <p>
       The second law of thermodynamics says that the entropy of the universe is always increasing. This is why the big bang was highly ordered, and we have been trudging on a one-way path towards disorder ever since, leading to the eventual heat death of the universe, where every atom of hydrogen is near aboslute zero and is almost infinitely far from every other atom. The universe is expanding, this is where we are headed in several trillion years.
      </p>
      <p>
       However the beauty of it is that despite the inevitable heat death of the universe, there can be local pockets of negentropy, where order takes over in a regional area. An example of this is DNA, which is able to repair itself and self-replicate. It preserves precise data over millennia.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another example is the sun. Instead of gasses all spreading apart, gravity pulls them together and they become so dense and hot that they ignite nuclear fusion explosions by the trillions, even creating new elements due to the intense gravity in the center. The elements get sorted by density:
       <a href="https://helios.gsfc.nasa.gov/onion.gif">
        https://helios.gsfc.nasa.gov/onion.gif
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       This is highly organized. This is a process of negentropy. Negentropy is the only reason we exist at all in this sea of ever-increasing entropy. It's like making a wave in a draining pool that allows the water to go higher for just a moment in a certain spot, even though the pool is still draining overall.
      </p>
      <p>
       Every time you clean your room, you create negentropy because things take on a more ordered state than they had previously. Every time you write a song, or write an essay, or think a high-level thought, you create negentropy in your brain and in your culture. If you create a house of cards, you create negentropy. However when you knock it down, you create the same amount of entropy. And the energy used to make the card house also created entropy. So there's always a net loss.
      </p>
      <p>
       Human culture is the billion-person effort of keeping alive our most negentropic concepts and ideas against the decay of time and entropy itself, so that we can see the universe from the highest perspective and stand on the shoulders of giants.
      </p>
      <p>
       When two people form a relationship, with inside jokes and subtleties, this is creating an arrangement of complexity. Then when the relationship ends, it creates entropy of an equal or greater amount. It is just like a complex industrial machine that engineers spent decades designing, that is now obsolete and sits rusting, unused. Complexity that is lost.
      </p>
      <p>
       When central banks were created, this is an arrangement of high complexity. When you have a deep conversation, even with yourself, this can be a discovery of new layers of complexity, and thus negentropy.
      </p>
      <p>
       But always remember, when creating negentropy, thermodynamics requires expending an equal or higher amount of entropy in the process. We cannot beat entropy in the long-term. Only in the short term, in little pockets of space. Michelangelo created the beautifully detailed statue David, but he still died. However David persists. And thus so does the cultural memory of Michelangelo.
      </p>
      <p>
       The arrangement of a computer is probably among the most negentropic creations of mankind. Along with things like rocket science, and thermodynamics. These highly organized systems of thinking and creation are so complex they were literally invisible to us until the last few hundred years. It makes a person wonder how much farther we can see. How much there is to know.
      </p>
      <p>
       Negentropy. It is us, we are it. It is the journey. Life and consciousness itself is negentropy. The sun. Our DNA. Love. Every laugh you've ever had. World history. Not a single one would exist without negentropy.
      </p>
      <p>
       A human being will die. Negentropy cannot be fully destroyed in our universe until the death of heat itself. Until then it can only change forms. This is why the ancient Egyptians said "Every person dies twice. Once with the death of their physical body, and again when their name is mentioned for the last time"
      </p>
      <p>
       It seems that life is negentropy. Is it possible that negentropy is the experience of consciousness itself?

       resonance is the physical phenomena that shows "lines of slack/least energy".  nature, naturally, aligns to this.

       Yes, resonance is like water going down the path of least resistance. If the shoe fits, wear it. So to speak.
      </p>
      <p>
       My favorite example of resonance: There was this earthquake of a certain frequency that happened in Asia. All the 20 story buildings fell down, but the 30 story buildings and 10 story buildings were fine. Because the earthquake was exactly the resonance frequency of only the 20 story buildings. I just think that's amazing

       Thanks for introducing me to this concept. I've seen the thing with the sand on the vibrating plate where it settles in to these modes of vibration that sometimes have startlingly complex shapes, but I've never thought about applying it to a broader variety of things.

       What do you mean by phi/narrative design? Not sure I get that part. Phi as in the golden ratio? Can you give example of some phi designs in nature?

       I feel like that last paragraph of yours could probably be expanded in to a whole book.

       the cymatics thing is the same deal as introducing energy into a system and it finding another balance, like say knocking a wine glass over moves it from an upright stable position to a sideways stable position.  electron rings operate on the same idea.
      </p>
      <p>
       phi design is this formula writ large and fractally :  old + now = new.  as you mutate you become a new thing.  this is the same idea as the hegelian dialectic.  the deal here being that things
       <em>
        append
       </em>
       .  designs
       <em>
        append
       </em>
       .  language, in general, is a decorative/appending design.  words are made up of other words.  sentences are appending in nature.  paragraphs.  chapters.  language is phi.  the asian languages like kanji also manifest this design principle, but their symbology is decorative/phi.  it's a fascinating design pattern.  in software it's called The Decorator Pattern.
      </p>

       re: tomato sauce.  so if you look at say how broccoli looks -
       <a href="http://www.laesieworks.com/thoughts/pict/Romanesco.jpg">
        http://www.laesieworks.com/thoughts/pict/Romanesco.jpg
       </a>
       - you can see the golden ratio.  but you also see symmetrical patterns.  i'd posit that you're seeing symmetrical patterns
       <em>
        move
       </em>
       or
       <em>
        slide
       </em>
       against each other in the broccoli pic.  that the phi-ness or appending-ness is manifested in the golden ratio-y arrangements, but the things being appended to each other are symmetrical structures.  so you get both symmetry and phi-ness.  humans, being mostly phi, are able to adapt their energy arrangements whatever the circumstance.  we're very adaptable.  adaptability is much easier to do when you have a narrative design vs a hierarchical design, because cross cutting changes are easier to introduce into models.  hierarchical designs (like say oo type hierarchies in software) scale combinatorically (ie. badly) to cross cutting change.  narrative designs handle these situations by appending information to the existing set of information.  it's just night and day in terms of scale.  i'd argue that humans are more like the phi lubricant than they are the "rigid design".

       Very interesting theory. I will have to chew on that one for a while. Thank you.

       How do fractals fit to in to this? Also I feel like the concepts of "top-down design" and "bottom-up design" are right there as well. How do these concepts fit in?

       So let's say we have a hierarchical structure.  We add a child node under a node.  How is that child node composed?  If the child node is a hierarchical structure itself, I'd call the design fractal.  The same pattern at each layer.  Same thing applies to phi.  Not only is there a narrative to the construction of a larger thing, there are narratives to the construction of each of the things that compose the larger thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       I reckon reality as we experience it is a fractal phi existence.
      </p>

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Yes this is hierarchy vs phi yet again!
      </p>
      <p>
       Top-down Design or "big design up front" imposes a structure.  This approach works ok initially, but when you want to extend cross-cutting behaviour across the entire model it starts to introduce scale burdens very quickly to how much the design can change.  This is same the phenomena of a system getting brittle over time.  Or a db schema getting unmanageable over time.  Or how some/most computer languages themselves tend to reach a final point because adding new syntax becomes unusable past a certain point.   Notice I'm talking about the ability of the modelling approach itself to add additional sub-models.  All of those problems don't exist with phi designs, really - only hierarchical/categorical ones.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bottom-up or "organic" design is phi - you grow something from a seed.
       <br/>
       This same general dualism is also found in Eric S Raymond's book
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cathedral_and_the_Bazaar">
        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cathedral_and_the_Bazaar
       </a>
       .  The Cathedral being the Top Down and the Bazaar being the Bottom Up.  In software you really see this idea explored much more than you see in other fields.  It's why things have moved to agile programming (a phi kinda model).  It's why we have no-sql storage now (a document kinda model.  documents (they're fucking books!) are phi).
      </p>
      <p>
       The software world is realizing that phi is better, and you're seeing this general transition away from hierarchical design, even though most of what you currently see in tech is hierarchical design.

       Really well said, fascinating stuff, especially about the no-sql databases and computer architecture. A lot to think about here.
      </p>
      <p>
       This reminds me of an experiment where they programmed an FPGA using genetic/evolutionary algorithms, and it programmed itself using a seemingly nonsensical arrangement of transistors, that weren't even connected. Yet it accomplished the job. There's a great story about it here:
       <a href="https://www.damninteresting.com/on-the-origin-of-circuits/">
        https://www.damninteresting.com/on-the-origin-of-circuits/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       I consider this experiment a breakthrough in computer programming that has yet to be fully explored. One of the most interesting things I've ever heard about, and ties right in to what you're saying. This would be a highly phi design, unlike the "big design up front" like most computer systems, to use your words. We see this some in software, like you pointed out, but this is a hardware version of that.
      </p>
      <p>
       And likewise, the resulting program only works on that specific FPGA, another FPGA of even the same model board cannot be loaded with the same evolved program; It won't function because it all depends on extremely minor circumstantial design properties in each individual FPGA chip.
      </p>
      <p>
       Very interesting stuff. Seems like evolution tends toward phi designs, and humans tend toward hierarchies. Probably because hierarchies are easier for our simple brains to keep track of, whereas phi networks are complex and patchwork and have no governing overarching rules.

       Yeah the GA stuff is cool.  Dig John Koza's stuff.  The wheel spin traction thing that one of the bots evolved was very informative of how much context matters in the evolved code.

       yeah this is it.  we live the first few years in a constant state of learning and growing needing guidance and stewardship the whole time.  this inculcates a sense of hierarchy.  and the phenomena of heroes doesn't help either, as we tend to organize around heroes, which all have predictable/repeatable/canonical modes of failure.  at a deep level many people instinctively understand that authority is a sketchy idea, and are distrustful of it.  but i really don't hear public dialogue as to how authority as a design pattern is flawed.  i'm trying to help change that.

       The world is filled with death, sadness, and hate.  The world
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       chaos.  The universe is chaos.  There is no order to things.  There is no guiding plan.  The world is what we make it and we have made it cruel.  Nothing will change what we have created.  Religion is just another way to make men feel superior over other men.  The only thing that has the potential to make things right is within us; empathy for our fellow man.  Embrace it.  There are no magic words.  There is no all mighty being.  We are alone.  That doesn't mean we have to give into our savage nature.  Judge others as you would judge yourself.  Let your empathy guide you and you can help to change the world.

       i would recommend anyone who is interested in the concept of entropy to read 'Demon Box' by Ken Kesey. it deals with the relationship between entropy, personal growth and change, and the evolution/rise and fall of movements and civilizations. the main question is: how to defeat the entropic energy exchange that seems to dictate the human condition, and doom everything to eventual decay?
      </p>
      <p>
       his answer: entropy only exists in a closed system.
      </p>
      <p>
       i've spent years thinking about that sentence.
