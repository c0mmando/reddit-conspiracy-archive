        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>

<p>I have written much about modern education, and this post is more of an expansion on some issues that have been troubling me lately. Here are the following disclaimers (seriously, I have to do this!):</p>

<p>1)  I sometimes generalize and I realize there are always exceptions</p>

<p>2)  Despite my critical views, I think change is possible (and I don’t think it is all bad)</p>

<p>3)  I am speaking from my experience at times, and there is no way I can encompass all experiences in one post (or the experiences of other teachers)</p>

<p>4)  If you disagree, don’t attack me. Discuss</p>

<p>5)  I am not criticizing YOU. I am criticizing the system.</p>

<p>The argument I am mostly making with my post today is that if we want to fix the issues in our schools, we need to change how our children are being raised at home.</p>

<p><strong>Schools Raise Our Kids</strong></p>

<p>No matter how involved you are as a parent, ultimately, you are leaving your child to be raised in schools. Much of what should be taught at home (hygiene, sex education, etc.) has now been thrown into control of public education. Sure, maybe parents are involved and care about their children’s grades, but ultimately, they really do not know what is actually happening the majority of the day. They are trusting the schools to properly take care of their children, while they try to manage their insanely busy schedules. Now, do not think I am criticizing parents – I am not. Our society is shaped so that teachers, in many ways, have become substitute parents so parents can work an excessive amount. I’m criticizing the structure of society. By the way, in wealthier areas, this may not be the case, but the focus of my post is more on the poorer areas of society (my experience).</p>

<p>More and more students are starting kindergarten without basic skills that should have been learned at home:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2796533/40-five-year-olds-lack-basic-skills-start-school-250-000-pupils-fall-short-targets-reading-writing.html">http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2796533/40-five-year-olds-lack-basic-skills-start-school-250-000-pupils-fall-short-targets-reading-writing.html</a></p>

<p>It’s hard to believe that public education did not always exist. At one point, parents gave up their rights to raise their children (at least on some level). Does public education need to exist on some level? I think it does. However, I also believe that if it does exist it needs to be completely transformed. </p>

<p>Also note that I used to mock people who home-schooled their children, but now I can see their concerns. </p>

<p><strong>The Ideal Classroom</strong></p>

<p>In a perfect world, teachers and schools would have the resources to individualize instruction as much as possible in order to properly move students as they take into account their unique needs/specific pace in learning. If you have ever been bored in school, you probably know this isn’t happening, or alternatively, if you have ever struggled in school, you probably know this isn’t happening. </p>

<p>Well let me give you a crash course as to why it is not, and it’s not because your teachers suck:</p>

<p>*Classrooms are overstuffed: There should never be more than 20 kids in a classroom. To me, 15-17 should be about the max number before it becomes too many. Unfortunately, many schools have classes of 30 or more students. And as more and more teachers leave the profession, the more overcrowded classrooms become:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.philly.com/philly/news/breaking/364812441.html">http://www.philly.com/philly/news/breaking/364812441.html</a></p>

<p>Now, before you say that 30 is not that bad – think about all of the needs of just 1 learner. Now think about a classroom with this mix:</p>

<p>5 English Language Learners (many definitions, ask to know more)</p>

<p>5 Students with a disability/IEP (Individualized Education Plan)</p>

<p>2 Gifted Education students (tested into gifted program)</p>

<p>5 Advanced Students (surpassing grade level)</p>

<p>5 Lower performing (not meeting grade level)</p>

<p>5 Average students (on track)</p>

<p>3 Other Issues (social, emotional, etc.)</p>

<p>On top of that, now imagine that of these 30 students, they are all from completely different socioeconomic backgrounds, cultures, and home lives. </p>

<p>Teachers are told in college that they must properly differentiate individually for every student in that classroom. Do you think that sounds tough? It absolutely is. By the way, this is just 30 students. Many are packed with 35+, even when there are state laws that forbid such practices.</p>

<p>So really, the solution would be to make classrooms as small as possible, but in reality, that is not happening. Instead, teachers are trained to “differentiate” instruction to reach every student. Of course, differentiation needs to happen no matter how many students you have, but when your classrooms are overstuffed, even the best teachers cannot reach every student (Except me – jk!!)</p>

<p>Now, a classroom of 30 in maybe an AP course – that’s different because the students are more leveled However, the more inclusive we are, the more we need to take precautions to ensure all needs of every students are met. Inclusion is advocated in education today, and I’m all for it – just lower my class sizes so that I can reach every student with their unique needs. 
Before you say, “This doesn’t happen at my school!” Then you’re lucky. The fact is more and more teachers are leaving the profession, and I have no doubt it is partly related to too many kids and not having enough time to do everything to meet their needs. </p>

<p><strong>Funding/Resources</strong></p>

<p>One day I was watching some talk show where a teacher was being commended for bringing food to feed kids every morning. I thought, great, I do that, too, but then it hit me:</p>

<p>TEACHERS SHOULD NOT HAVE TO DO THAT. The article reads, &quot;Amazing teacher brings food for students&quot;, but it should read &quot;Children are going to school hungry.&quot;</p>

<p>I wish I could go into my receipts and add up how much money I have actually spent on my classroom. I would say it’s more than anyone would probably believe. </p>

<p>There are many issues with funding and resources for classrooms, and I wanted to touch on a few:</p>

<p>1)  They want all students adequately using technology, yet most districts refuse to spend money on proper updates for technology. Every student today ideally should have their own laptop provided by a school district. If school districts test students on computers now, then they should prepare students on computers.</p>

<p>2)  Some schools make the process of requesting resources so long and difficult, that it is just not worth the time. For example, requesting posters or paper can take months in some schools. </p>

<p>3)  The more students you have (the overcrowded classroom) the harder it is to buy the materials you need. There is big difference in money when I buy supplies for 70 students versus 100 students. I’d complain less about spending money for my classroom, if I had less students to buy for. </p>

<p>4)  Good learning takes good resources. That’s the end of it. Even the best teachers need the best tools. </p>

<p>5)  Schools’ funding is always being cut. Always. Federal education funding is plummeting yearly:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/blogs/data-mine/2015/06/24/report-federal-education-funding-cut-by-5-times-more-than-all-spending">https://www.usnews.com/news/blogs/data-mine/2015/06/24/report-federal-education-funding-cut-by-5-times-more-than-all-spending</a></p>

<p>Well, guess who picks up the slack as they continually cut funding – teachers! So, not only do we have these overcrowded classrooms, but we also must take a huge cut of our paycheck weekly on supplies and materials. </p>

<p>I admit I buy more than I should for my students, but I do not know what else to do anymore. It has just become a necessary expense, so that my students can properly learn. In an ideal world, the school system would provide me with the necessities, and then any extra would be to my own discretion.</p>

<p><strong>School is a Waste of Time</strong></p>

<p>Now, don’t get me wrong – I think education is of the utmost importance, and I do everything, and I mean everything I can to teach well. But ultimately, students are in schools for too long, and they are not being taught efficiently. I especially believe that as students get older, the school day should be shortened, and there should be alternative paths for students who want to intern, start classes at local colleges, etc. Instead, students are stuffed into classrooms for 9 hours a day, and in much of that time, they are learning the same things over and over and over. 
The research on longer school days is mixed, and often biased, so I am not going to include that here. However, I would argue that more quality instruction in shorter days is better for students. 
If there are 30+ kids in a classroom, then maybe teachers need those longer days. But, if we have smaller classrooms, with the proper resources, then shorter days would be no problem. Teachers could get through with what they need to, and everybody would be happier and less stressed.</p>

<p>Instead of actually fixing the system (which never happens), more and more schools are increasing the time students are in school to try to close achievement gaps.</p>

<p>Look at the articles advocating for longer school days. They are about low-performing schools and charter schools:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2014/05/extended-school-days/371896/">https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2014/05/extended-school-days/371896/</a></p>

<p>Now, come on – for many in poor areas, school is an escape. It’s a way NOT to be home. I have no doubt there’s a reason that longer school days work in areas in poverty. Quite frankly, students may not even have parents at home to raise them.
It’s a harsh truth that nobody wants to hear, but I guess I’ll say it.
Again, it goes back to schools raising the children. </p>

<p><strong>Being Smart Isn’t Cool</strong></p>

<p>I remember being made fun of constantly for reading in high school. I remember I was maybe 1 of the 200 students in my grade level who actually would sit and read a book just to read. Other students would come up to me and ask me why I was reading in study hall. </p>

<p>I realized something as a teacher these past few years. It really is not valued to be intelligent in our society. The fact that we have a social group called the “nerds” or “geeks” is evidence of that – and the words usually have negative connotations (unless the nerd becomes rich, right?)</p>

<p>I see the struggle daily with my students. Many are very smart, but quite simply, they want to fit in, and being really smart doesn’t help you fit in. So they have to have a balancing act of being smart and succeeding, but not being <em>too</em> smart. Ultimately, it pushes many students to not live to their full potential. And by the way, the larger the classes, the more this pressure exists. In smaller classrooms, it is easier to get to know one another as humans. In larger classroom, it’s easier for your mind to group others into categories. </p>

<p>It is no surprise that students with higher intelligence are often bullied:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/11/20/survey-finds-more-than-90_n_2166734.html">http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/11/20/survey-finds-more-than-90_n_2166734.html</a></p>

<p>This is really a larger issue though. Once you are an adult, there really is no time for deep-thinking, so no wonder it is undervalued. Think about the typical adult in our society. After work, they are too exhausted, so it is easier to do something that is more mindless. Very few have the mental energy to read philosophical books after working for 12 hours.</p>

<p>Yet, in schools, we are telling kids about how learning is so important, and they need to dream big and push themselves.
But students are not stupid. They start to see the lie as they get older. They see their exhausted parents, and they realize that they only have to do the bare minimum to actually get where they want to go…or need to go. Is it really a choice? </p>

<p>There is no culture of learning in our society. Not only is there not time for it, but it is not even promoted on a fundamental level. </p>

<p><strong>Modern Values</strong></p>

<p>If being intelligent is not valued, then what is? </p>

<p>Technology: </p>

<p><a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/internet/10029180/Children-using-internet-from-age-of-three-study-finds.html">http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/internet/10029180/Children-using-internet-from-age-of-three-study-finds.html</a></p>

<p>So, now, more than ever, children are being raised by a screen, but are they sitting there, reading the Odyssey by Homer? No, this is what they are doing in their free time now, outside of school:</p>

<p>*They are abusing themselves to look like Kylie Jenner:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2015/04/21/kylie-jenner-challenge-the-dangers-of-plumping-that-pout/?utm_term=.6e45040541f3">https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2015/04/21/kylie-jenner-challenge-the-dangers-of-plumping-that-pout/?utm_term=.6e45040541f3</a></p>

<p>*They are looking for ‘likes’ online because they are not getting the proper validation or attention elsewhere:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.newportacademy.com/resources/mental-health/teens-social-media-addiction/">https://www.newportacademy.com/resources/mental-health/teens-social-media-addiction/</a></p>

<p>*They are losing the ability to socially interact. Actual conversation is becoming a thing of the past:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/12/09/children-texting-technology-social-skills_n_1137570.html">http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/12/09/children-texting-technology-social-skills_n_1137570.html</a></p>

<p>*And they are becoming wired for distraction – not education:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/21/technology/21brain.html?pagewanted=all&amp;amp;mcubz=3">http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/21/technology/21brain.html?pagewanted=all&amp;amp;mcubz=3</a></p>

<p>And as always, they are worshipping celebrities who seemed to magically obtain their riches, thinking if they were just beautiful and rich enough, they would be just like them. </p>

<p>Also, children are just not reading anymore. They have apps, and games, and youtube, of course:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/appsblog/2013/sep/26/children-reading-less-apps-games">https://www.theguardian.com/technology/appsblog/2013/sep/26/children-reading-less-apps-games</a></p>

<p><strong>Bringing It Together</strong></p>

<p>Not only do teachers have to deal with lack of funding, over-work, and so much more, but now the students they are getting in their classrooms are more disconnected than ever. 
Teachers have absolutely been villainized. Parents (and society) blame teachers for growing educational problems, never thinking that it really starts at home.  </p>

<p>Scenario 1: The teacher is trying to get Johnny to learn at school, but at home, Johnny has no support from parents because they are working. Johnny is being raised by his phone/tablet. Johnny thinks school is a waste of time because he can get rich and famous and become a youtube star. Parents come to conferences and yell at teachers, when in reality, they are frustrated with Johnny and do not know how to change their child because <strong>somebody else raised him!</strong></p>

<p>Scenario 2: Sarah comes from an extremely dysfunctional family. Dad is not involved, and mom is on and off drugs. Sarah goes to a good school and gets great support from teachers. Sarah relies on school for hope, but school does not last forever. Will Sarah be successful after her school years end? Can she rise above the dysfunctional environment?</p>

<p>Scenario 3: Parents are very involved in Noah’s education. Noah is an excellent student, but he is only motivated because his parents will expect nothing less than perfection. Noah’s parents do not help him develop an intrinsic value for learning, but he associates doing well in school with the love of his parents. He only does well because he parents expect it, and he cannot wait to get out of school. One day, though, he will repeat the same thing for his children because that is what he learned. There is no inner love of learning developed or perpetuated. Learning is directly connected to success – not intelligence.</p>

<p>Intelligence is not valued in our society. Success is valued.</p>

<p>I could do these scenarios all day. What do these scenarios always go back to though? THE PARENTS. </p>

<p>More than poverty, more than race, more than any other factor, parents are the key to student success:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/opinion/readersrespond/bs-ed-segregation-letter-20170323-story.html">http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/opinion/readersrespond/bs-ed-segregation-letter-20170323-story.html</a></p>

<p>It’s quite simple isn’t it?  The environments we are raised in will ultimately determine our values, our beliefs, our successes. Now, there are people who somehow escape and rise above their environments, and I am not dismissing individual responsibility (In fact, I’d say I was one who escaped a pretty terrible childhood).</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I’d say most do not, and now that parents are raising children less, then schools become the parents.
So, students become products of their school environments, where in many ways, they become robotic members of society – not thinking, just doing, trying to survive the school day.</p>

<p><strong>It Isn’t All Bleak</strong></p>

<p>I know when I write I am highly critical, but I want you to know that I do not think it is all bleak. I do think there is good, and I do think that it is possible for many to rise above. Society may be flawed, but we can all rise out of this sad environment if we want to…but how?</p>

<p>Well, first and foremost, I think all people should be reading. Books are our teachers. I really, really think that maybe people should go back to reading hard copy books. I think it is just too easy to get distracted reading on a technological device (I AM NOT AGAINST IT IF YOU WANT).  In fact, I tell my students they don’t really even need me (for the most part). They need to learn how to teach themselves, and they can if they really, really want to. </p>

<p>Next, if you have kids, be a parent. They have to go to school, but educate them at home when they’re home. Don’t just say – do. If you want them to read, read with them. If you want them off their phones, get off yours and establish some rules. Maybe no phones at the dinner table? Maybe actually sit down and talk to your kids. I know there are some amazing parents out there by the way, but I am asking you if you are a parent, are you doing what you should for your child? If your child has issues, it starts at home. What is happening at home to create those issues? </p>

<p>Finally, be the change you wish to see. If you are like me, and you’re tired of this mindless society, then start changing things. Our society is a result of what we value. If we spend all of our time watching youtube videos about Kim Kardashian and cats, then what are we really doing for the world?</p>

<p>If we want to make the world a better place, it is starts at home. Whatever we feed our children is what they will ultimately produce in society. </p>

<p>I hope to hear your thoughts 😊</p>

<p>I never expect these posts to get so long btw!</p>

<p>Just an anecdote that I&#39;ve posted about before, a few months ago, I was visited by CPS. The reason? An anonymous complaint (that we&#39;ve narrowed down to the librarian at the public library,) that my son&#39;s dad and I were lying about my child&#39;s age <em>to keep him out of school</em>. She claimed that he was 6 or 7 (he&#39;s four,) and that he is delayed because he acts like a four year old (because he&#39;s four, lol.)</p>

<p>Luckily, the CPS gal met my family and closed the case immediately, but I still shake my head over it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great tldr from<a href="/u/c-novo">/u/c-novo</a></p>

<p>You&#39;re absolutely right. And I think this goes hand in hand with the slow collapse of society we&#39;re witnessing today. </p>

<p>Schools almost function more as daycare services for overworked parents than actual learning institutions. Natural curiosity is suppressed in favor of prescribed curriculum. Critical thinking is sacrificed for regurgitation. And intelligence is bullied into hiding. </p>

<p>These underfunded daycares don&#39;t have the capacity to personalize education. Overcrowded classrooms necessitate standardized teaching which then leads to standardized intelligence. No Child Left Behind™ sounds wonderful until it holds back any who wish to progress. </p>

<p>Compound that issue with the proliferation modern technology. Real learning doesn&#39;t take place when attention spans are robbed by the black mirrors in our pockets and in our living rooms. Like moths to flames, children can hardly resist flashing images in favor of boring books. </p>

<p>Society can only decline when its members have devalued intelligence. Authoritative obedience seems to be the only successful outcome of our prussian education system. This dependence on authority then leads to the ever-increasing Nanny-State where people forget (or don&#39;t even want to) think for themselves. </p>

<p>I know calling people &quot;sheep&quot; is cliché, but that&#39;s what the wolves designed the system to produce. However, your articulation through this post and others you&#39;ve written gives me hope that there still are godsent teachers out there that could actually give these children a chance.</p>

<p>Once again, great post <a href="/u/polkadotgirl">/u/polkadotgirl</a>, you seem to always hit the nail on the head.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been where you are. I was dreading the school thing before we had kids. Take heart, you won&#39;t ruin your child&#39;s social development by homeschooling, if you make an effort. You can make friends with other homeschool families, join a network of them, homeschool through a charter school, join a church with lot of kids, drive her to sports if they aren&#39;t in your area... We are very, very fortunate to live in a county with charter schools, several offering hybrid homeschool options (2-3 days at school, the rest at home). It&#39;s amazing! It took a lot of effort to find the school, and gain admission as we are not residents of that city. I also drive 40 mins each way, with preschoolers in tow. It isn&#39;t easy, but there are options out there. And you have lots of time to look into it! Homeschooling is the fastest growing educational trend in the country- in 5 years time the options will only  have expanded.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You know, I totally bought into that myth that the homeschooled kids are all socially stunted weirdos... because it&#39;s what the public schools indoctrinated me to believe.</p>

<p>Now that I&#39;ve been in the real world for a few years, I can say unequivocally that the homeschooled kids that I work with are head and shoulders beyond public school kids in every category, except for maybe drug use.</p>

<p>Homeschool your fuckin kids. Find a way. Make the sacrifice.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh man, education. One of our most dysfunctional systems. I&#39;ll qualify myself before I get on my soapbox. 😊</p>

<p>I have worked with kids professionally since I was 18 (34 now) and teaching preschool. I&#39;ve worked in charter schools, big districts (I lasted a week!), as a therapeutic preschool teacher, as a consultant and as a nanny. I also spent my time in the system as a bright student and got a psychology degree. But I dropped out of high school and got my GED at 17 because i just didn&#39;t fit.</p>

<p>As an adult I love teaching. I love kids, I love seeing them make connections and fostering their natural curosity. Which is why I am not a teacher! I couldn&#39;t do that in most classrooms because they are so restrictive. When I was a consultant I worked with families and schools to help meet the needs of kids that were struggling. And a lot of the time it was a just a sensitive child in an intolerable environment. I would leave some observations and just cry because these kids are being ruined. </p>

<p>So I am back to being a nanny and care for just two families. One is a baby and the other is a 5 year old with ADHD. I can&#39;t fix the system but I can do my little part to shield a couple kiddos from its harm.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Very good post and hits on a number of factors. I&#39;d imagine that most of the problems with public education and the deliberate dumbing down and building of subservience of the population is by design via the corporations and moneyed industries and interest of the World setting the pace of the state in order to have total control of the populace and to make sure their unremarkable progeny and kept at the top by eliminating any competition from the middle classes.

    <div class="md"><p>I was in school in the 90s, and the cultural meme at the time was &quot;parents are bone heads&quot;. So I think anyone who watched TV and went to high school at that time is going to have a similar story, if they&#39;re being honest. </p>

<p>I remember reading a fun conspiracy about the Harry Potter book series being written to drive kids away from their parents, intellectually. Some other things about JK Rowling not being the person she says she is etc. Not clue if it&#39;s true, I&#39;m just here for entertainment. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fellow public school teacher here. Bravo. </p>

<p>I have been teaching for more than ten years and am finally starting to make a path for myself to leave education for good, primarily for my own physical and mental health, and because I would like to have a family and actually be able to watch my children grow up. I currently work such absurd hours that I would maybe see my children for one to two hours each evening and on Sundays. Maintaining a marriage is hard enough. Sadly, my reasons for wanting to leave have nothing to do with the kids. I teach wonderful kids. But the system is so broken that I will likely homeschool my own children. It&#39;s so sad that it&#39;s come to this. My senior colleagues who are five or six years away from retirement all tell me &quot;I can stick this out for another five or six years but I don&#39;t blame you for wanting to get out if you&#39;re staring down another twenty years.&quot; </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is not the kids. I see a lot of educators who hate kids but they are looking in the wrong direction.</p>

<p>Thanks for your insight!</p>

<p>Are you familiar with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eP98ZKt709A">John Taylor Gatto</a>? tl;dr New York &#39;Teacher of the Year&#39; looked into the <strong>history</strong> of education and discovered it is literally designed and intended to make the masses more stupid, homogeneous and pliable.</p>
