    <div class="md"><p>Bullshit.  If the DNC, HRC, and the media didn&#39;t collude with each other and conspire against Bernie, he would be president.  Trump didn&#39;t win the election, Clinton lost it.  She lost despite him.  The powers that be put Trump against Clinton thinking it would give her a an easy victory.  What they failed to estimate in the game was that Americans were finally ready to say fuck you to the establishment. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Mkay, so what are you arguing about?  That the press created his movement by relentlessly attacking him and demonizing him to the point of comparing him to Hitler?  Faulty logic there.  Trump is insanely popular with a vast amount of Americans from different walks of life.  That&#39;s not manufactured.  The devotion of the people that voted for him was definitely not manufactured either.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s my point.... I understand he had a swell of support, but you have to understand the role of the media. His campaign could&#39;ve been treated like the farce it was by the media, but at least during the primary, the media helped legitimize his candidacy. We know HRC&#39;S team, the DNC, and the media colluded to make this happen.   We also know they worked to destroy Bernie&#39;s campaign.</p>

<p>Once Bernie was out of the way and Trump got the nomination, they unleashed all of the bad press.  The thing is, while Trump got a swell of support from people who were sick and fucking tired of the establishment, those on the left who desired change were left without a viable candidate. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Trump&#39;s popularity had nothing to do with Bernie&#39;s, they were popular for similar but different reasons with entirely different crowds.  Treating his campaign and supporters as a spectacle for racists and bigots populated with deplorables in the media helped &quot;legitimize Trump&#39;s candidacy&quot; by exposing how much the media was lying about the man more than anything.  Bernie got railroaded because he would have beaten Clinton for the nomination, and that was the fault of the DNC and the media and Clinton&#39;s campaign, not Trump.  Both ran as anti-establishment candidates and had a similar message on many levels, and lots of Bernie supporters went to Trump after he got screwed.</p>

<p>We clearly were not watching the same campaigns or the same media coverage.  The second Trump became the front-runner in the Republican Party and even before that he was being ridiculed and slandered by everyone, it only got worse once he became the actual nominee.  The left being unable to get behind a candidate who actually stood behind his principles - meaning Sanders and his lack of a spine - isn&#39;t Trump&#39;s fault either.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>i think its proof that the system works. the media the establishment, every one fought tooth and nail to make it about jebby boy and hillary or anyone but trump throughout the entire election process. he blew them away and they couldn&#39;t fudge it in any way. it was obvious. the crowds during debates, cheering donald and in many cases booing hillary, independent and established polls showed it. so now the game is to smear him in any way possible, and all of these attempts have failed.   people like donald, and they cant do anything about it. all they can do is bash, bash, bash. im not even a trump fan im independant.  the whole thing just cracks me up to no end.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s true that he was elected by the people, technically. He did lose the popular vote by 3 million. Also, the majority of America disapproves of the work he has done thus far. Besides the medias coverage of him isn&#39;t entirely negative, Fox News likes him.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The vote was almost entirely fraudulent, it&#39;s probably more likely than not that Hillary Clinton actually lost if you count all the illegal voters and dead people.  The polls that determine how much of Americans actually support Trump&#39;s policies are created in disseminated by the very same media that hates him and said he would never win.  Fox News is hardly as pro-Trump as they were pro-Bush, an establishment Republican that was infinitely worse than Trump.</p>

<p>Crazy. Maybe one day we can get direct democratically elections just like the country of..... Wow only switzerland. The only one. </p>

<p>Really activates my almonds. Bet all countries of the world are just dumb to not implement this. Sure there no nuances that would make this a terrible idea. New York and LA making america bend to their will i&#39;m sure would make our country super great. Damn founding fathers getting in the way. </p>

<p>But they don&#39;t. Maybe you think that people should count for less if they live in densely populated areas, and that&#39;s your opinion. But the Electoral College is specifically designed to <em>not</em> elect by &quot;the will of the people&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>More than Clinton?  Come on dude.  You&#39;re comparing an establishment darling with 40-plus years of insider political experience versus a man who was never ever a politician.  Trump was smart to surround himself with some of the smartest guys in the room in their respective fields.  Trump and the government are currently negotiating a way to transition the dollar into a gold-backed currency and they need people with insider knowledge and knowledge of the banking system... like, say, ex-Goldman Sachs employees, many of which quit because they did not agree with the company&#39;s ethics.</p>

<p>Who do you think put Trump into the Presidency in the first place?  A faction of military, intelligence, industry and financial insiders that wrested control of the country and election away from the Cabal.  <em>Nobody</em> said Trump and his backers were clean, but they are not a part of the same ruling class of criminals that have been in charge since at least the days of JFK, and that is fundamentally important to have proper context with what&#39;s going on behind the scenes right now.</p>

<p>Trump is just a front man of a civil war between the Elite that has been going on behind the scenes for a while but only recently exploded into full-on Rebellion.  Trump represents a group of American Elites that want to restore America to being a Constitutional Republic, regain its former role as an example to other countries via a focus on innovation, rebuilding infrastructure, nationalist trade deals and a goal of general meritocracy.</p>

<p>They are <em>not</em> the same people that were backing Hillary, Obama, Bush and the Cabal/globalist factions.  They we&#39;re planning to kickstart World War 3 with Russia, China, Syria and Iran and bring about the depopulation of 90% of the planet.  Hillary Clinton was to preside over the real start of the New World Order for them.  She had the US election electronically rigged to win in what was essentially a civilian coup d&#39;etat that would have been a repeat of what happened to Bernie Sanders, only on a national scale and with the Presidency on the line.  Trump&#39;s backers intervened behind the scenes to make sure this would not happen, and his when is why a lot of their establishment mouthpieces in the media and in politics have been frothing-at-the-mouth to get Trump out.  They fear him and what he is doing because it could lead to the end of the line for their little party at our expense.  This has been documented by several government insiders and prominent figures in the intelligence community such as Dr. Steve Pieczenik, Robert David Steele, FBIAnon, and Field McConnell, truthseekers such as David Wilcock, Corey Goode, and Alex Jones, various campaign and personal insiders and friends such as Bannon, Roger Stone, Newt Gingrich, etc.  The evidence is more than sufficient to prove that Trump is not one of them, and the reaction of the media to the things he does is fairly obvious proof of this.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t agree with everything Trump does or says, but he&#39;s on the right side of History here.  Hillary Clinton winning would have been the beginning of the end.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He gave Donald a million dollars to start his businesses, according to the man himself.  Yes he did hobnob with the Elite and make business deals with them, but he&#39;d also be the first person to tell people that none of them really like him because he was their competition.  You can&#39;t make it big in the business world without shaking hands with some shady people, but you also can&#39;t link it casually and just say well it just means he&#39;s one of them, or that he&#39;s owned somehow by these people.  Please show me how <em>anywhere</em> in Trump&#39;s agenda or what he&#39;s done so far how it in any way feeds into the machinations of George Soros, also.  You&#39;re talking about the same guy that is currently funding counter-protests to have him thrown out of government, violently if necessary.</p>

<p>Trump is an outsider because he&#39;s not &quot;initiated&quot; like the rest of them.  The political clique is not the same as the business clique.  Just watch the video with Rudy Giuliani or Newt Gingrich or any of his close supporters and friends who are all saying the same thing, &quot;he&#39;s not one of them&quot;.  There&#39;s DC, and there&#39;s everybody else.  Trump might have rubbed elbows with some of them and could even be friends with a few of them, but Tucker Carlson wasn&#39;t exaggerating when he said that out of the three million people working in the government, maybe 50 of them actually like him.  Your mistake is that you think the legitimate and real hatred coming from mainstream media outlets and establishment is an act, when it&#39;s not.  And the fact that these people - who are the mouthpieces of the Elite establishment - are unified in opposition to him and his policies, that means he&#39;s not on their side.  Pretty simple.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is a massive exaggeration and a discredit to how smart Trump actually is.  I find it hilarious how people on Reddit who have no fucking experience running a multi-billion-dollar company that is a household name in several different industries honestly think that a man like Trump who has accomplished what he has is an idiot, or crazy.  </p>

<p>Maybe you&#39;re not seeing things the same way I am.  Trump has been solidly advancing his agenda (when he can) and generally keeping to more campaign promises than most Presidents in recent memory, hands down.  People think draining the swamp is like an instant thing, you&#39;re talking about an entrenched bureaucracy of corruption that&#39;s hundreds of years old.  If he just locked up the household names and political opposition without having ironclad cases he&#39;d be crucified.  Just look at the progress in the Awan Brothers the progress in the Awan Brothers/ DWS case, that one thread could literally bring down a huge segment of the government, and that never would have happened without Trump being in office.  Or you could bring up the thousands upon thousands of pedophiles and human traffickers that he&#39;s locked up since he took office.  These actions alone when exposed to the public could absolutely destroy the fabric of this country and government with the revelations that will come out that will utterly shatter everybody&#39;s views on what we truly are as a nation, especially in relation to the rest of the world.  So far he&#39;s been very cagey and almost always ahead of his enemies, while also making some pretty obvious gaffes.</p>

<p>Halt globalist agenda - umm, gutted TPP and the Paris climate change agreement, reportedly switching the dollar to a gold-backed currency, negotiating out of NAFTA, massive drive for infrastructure rebuilding and economic nationalism, massive tax reform, every single one of those things is NOT what globalists want.</p>

<li><p>He earned the billions.  Ever try turning $1,000 into a million?  LOL you make it seem like he literally was handed billions of dollars and just became Donald Trump.  He&#39;s a household name in several industries for a reason, and has lost most of his money before and gained it all back.  &quot;Self-made&quot; is another term to use that applies.</p></li>
<li><p>Yeah his &quot;FBI informant&quot; Uncle was John Trump, a brilliant scientist and the guy that studied and cataloged Nikola Tesla&#39;s patents and was a Doctor at MIT.  Your implication is stupid.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Ex</em>-employees, many of whom quit because they did not like the company or its ethics, and have invaluable experience and connections in the banking and financial sectors.  That designation is sort of important, no?</p></li>
<li><p>Yeah, Rex Tillerson, probably the most qualified Secretary of State to ever take the post due to the fact that he has business and personal contacts and relationships with virtually every leader on the planet, thanks to ExxonMobil, that company that produces the gas your car runs on LMFAO.  Welcome to meritocracy.  And capitalism, I guess.</p></li>
<li><p>Got some sources for that?</p></li>
<li><p>LMFAO what kind of logic is this?   He was a registered Democrat and then a registered Republican and happens to be old, therefore he&#39;s a politician?  TIL; being registered to Parties gives you &quot;political experience&quot;.  Shit, I&#39;m entering my 17th year of political experience now!</p></li>
<li><p>This is a blatant lie.  Looks to me like they were just casual friends and business associates.  Trump was never a passenger on the plane OR a guest at his island, and Trump actually had him thrown out of Mar-A-Lago and banned because he sexually assaulted an underage worker.  In fact Trump has locked up something like 3000 to 5000 pedophiles/traffickers ever since he&#39;s taken office, by far more than any other President in history, so your implication is probably false.</p></li>
<li><p>Gorka is not a Nazi, you hyperbolic twit, wearing a medal in honor of your heritage from a conservative Christian group <em>alleged</em> to have some ties to the Nazis doesn&#39;t make you a literal Nazi.  In fact, he made several statements to the media explaining that he wore the medal to honor his late father, Paul Gorka, who was awarded it for his fight against <em>communism</em> during Hungary&#39;s period of communist rule.  Oops!  He has given a similar reasoning for occasionally using the initial &quot;v.&quot; in his name — a mark used by Vitezi Rend members to show the order has been bestowed upon them.  He said it was in remembrance of his dad.  NAZI!!!!!!</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Doesn&#39;t matter how much you hate the guy, Trump is clearly opposed by the establishment at every turn, in both parties, and in the media.  That is just objective fact, and the occasional positive piece from Fox News does not invalidate any of that.</p>

<p>Anybody that thinks Trump is even in the same league of establishment corruption as the Clintons, Bushes, Obama or even Reagan is deluded, or an absolute moron.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s all a scam. He was blessed for the position like everyone always is. Remember the statement two wings of the same bird. They painted Trump is anti-establishment candidate in order to make people go that way because they felt that they were going that way anyway. You can tell he&#39;s not the antiestablishment candidate for the fact that when he Got in three weeks later he was lobbing cruise missiles  at Syria just like H would have.</p>
