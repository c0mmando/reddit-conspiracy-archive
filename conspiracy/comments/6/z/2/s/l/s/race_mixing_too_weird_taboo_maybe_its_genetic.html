<p>Some if not most of all same race couples in ALL races seriously look like they could be siblings. Two brown haired whites? Two same shade blacks? Then you see somehow two Chinese or pale redheads together, somehow, in America the most diverse country in human history.</p>

<p>To me they all look like they could be siblings. Just breeding with the same looking traits or the same culture. Maybe this is where conservativism starts in any culture. Preserving your color and traditions.</p>

<p>I start to think about how all of human history has led to a moment where a child can be born from two completely different looking people from the same species from different parts of the world. It can only be a benefit to the human species.</p>

<p>There&#39;s an easy way to gauge how racist or prejudice you are as well. Just answer the question. If racism is no big deal, would you trade your skin color now to be black in America? </p>

<p>If you answered anything other than yes... </p>

<p>inb4 there are couples with real differences in the same race group. Yeah, they don&#39;t count because brown eyed whites are destroying the blue eyed whites. We talking, near same skin shade, near hair color, eye color, body build etc. </p>

<p>Yeah, the studies of Freud would be a big help here. People seem to think it&#39;s ego. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My family has many mixed race pairs.  It seems to be most common in the generation after me.  But even so my (white) dad remarried to a mexican.  I&#39;m (white) attracted to indian and mexican women.  Two of my nieces have children with black men, a third is dating one, and a fourth is dating a mexican.  My theory is finally the newer generations are mixing a lot more.</p>

<p>Though I agree through observation there are many couples out there that seem to pair up with people very similar to themselves.</p>
