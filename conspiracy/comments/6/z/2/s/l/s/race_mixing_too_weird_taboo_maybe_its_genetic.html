       My body is ready for the accusations.

       Some if not most of all same race couples in ALL races seriously look like they could be siblings. Two brown haired whites? Two same shade blacks? Then you see somehow two Chinese or pale redheads together, somehow, in America the most diverse country in human history.
      </p>
      <p>
       To me they all look like they could be siblings. Just breeding with the same looking traits or the same culture. Maybe this is where conservativism starts in any culture. Preserving your color and traditions.
      </p>
      <p>
       I start to think about how all of human history has led to a moment where a child can be born from two completely different looking people from the same species from different parts of the world. It can only be a benefit to the human species.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's an easy way to gauge how racist or prejudice you are as well. Just answer the question. If racism is no big deal, would you trade your skin color now to be black in America?
      </p>
      <p>
       If you answered anything other than yes...
      </p>
      <p>
       inb4 there are couples with real differences in the same race group. Yeah, they don't count because brown eyed whites are destroying the blue eyed whites. We talking, near same skin shade, near hair color, eye color, body build etc.

       Subconscious symmetry has a greater role in how we percieve around us than I think most people appreciate. I read a great article one time that basically made the case that, more than any other thing, bilateral symmetry was the objective basis for beauty.

       Well i do have to admit that myself and Mrs Tron are very similiar looking as we both have similiar mixed heritage. But on the other hand i often find a good looking girl from a different race, to be quite attractive.

       We've always had an amount of Muslims here and there's very little animosity towards them. Most of them integrate into the communities although there are smaller groups that act more privately..

       humans are so unbelievably alike in so many ways, its mind blowing. I suspect what people see or act out  is culture clash, mainly not biology (though certain biology does influence culture). The freud type psychology is an interesting topic- how much is culture and how do humans want to marry their parent?

       Yeah, the studies of Freud would be a big help here. People seem to think it's ego.

       I learned in my psych class (that I slept through a lot) when we are looking for our mates/lovers, our subconscious mind that handles 140 billion bits of information a second is trying to find similarities between our own physique &amp; the other individual out of both narcissism &amp; the innate understanding that a similar mating partner would lead to a hopefully higher success rate in rearing of offspring.

       My family has many mixed race pairs.  It seems to be most common in the generation after me.  But even so my (white) dad remarried to a mexican.  I'm (white) attracted to indian and mexican women.  Two of my nieces have children with black men, a third is dating one, and a fourth is dating a mexican.  My theory is finally the newer generations are mixing a lot more.
      </p>

       Though I agree through observation there are many couples out there that seem to pair up with people very similar to themselves.

       It's almost like people have preferences for who they would like to mate with, whether conscious or subconscious. Birds of a feather, flock together.

       I was added to their fucking list for an upvote on a post about dual citizenship. That has nothing to do with race, its about nationality. I PMed them to take my name off but I guess its legal to claim people are racists. 2013 court case ruling

       Eh, nations often have one race within them. I dunno what your post upvote was about, but I'm pretty jealous of dual citizenship.

       It's a reactionary subreddit. I could care less if they think I'm racist or prejudice. And I'm obviously liberal as fuck and will continue to be.

       Evolutionarily speaking, it's far more advantageous to date outside your group.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since interracial marriage has been legalized it's increased almost every year. The law and conservative social mores seem to suppress the natural desire to mate outside of your group.
