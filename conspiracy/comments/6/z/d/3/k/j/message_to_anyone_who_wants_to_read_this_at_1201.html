        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The entire narrative that has been ingrained into our society over the last two decades speaking of evil Muslim boogeymen who are hellbent on destroying western civilization was created by the United States and Israel when they conspired and killed 2977 human beings in a false flag attack on September 11th, 2001. They used this attack as pretense to push an agenda in the Middle East, where hundreds of thousands of innocent people have died since 2003. Terrorist groups like Al-Queda and ISIS rose to power thanks to CIA/Mossad funding during the Soviet-Afghan and Iraq wars respectively, and exist as enemies of the United States only on the News, when in fact they are tools used by our military industrial complex to grant us casus beli and garner diplomatic and public support whenever we please.</p>

<p>You are witnessing the exact same thing now with North Korea; they are puppets being dangled and manipulated in front of us while our country continues to wage war-for-profit worldwide in the name of goodness and democracy. Whatever happens to North Korea in the end will not be their own doing, but the bidding of the puppeteers, who have been putting on a show for the American people since November 22nd, 1963 when they began silently destroying privacy, free speech, and the vision of the founding fathers. Make no mistake my friends, Republican or Democrat, Donald or Hillary, all rivers lead to the same ocean and we will never again regain control of our country while the two party system masquerades around as an illusion of democracy. Social media has supplanted religion as the opiate of the masses and primary tool for controlling and subverting the will of the people.</p>

<p>To those of you like myself who prefer substantive primary resources and objective, fact based research instead of long-winded political statements on reddit like the one above, please don&#39;t hesitate to comment below or private message me and I&#39;d be happy to share my work and answer any questions you might have about the claims that I am making, however in the end I urge everyone to do their own critical thinking, research, and arrive at their own conclusions! This isn&#39;t Fox News or CNN where you are told what to think and how to feel.</p>

<p><strong>Edit: To fellow humans in other countries, I don&#39;t care if you&#39;re a 14 year old paraplegic from Thailand, a 73 year old lesbian from France, or a 40 year old North Korean farmer, if you believe in a system of government which provides the freedom of speech, information, and privacy while striving to serve the best interests of its people in a transparent and fair manner and not bowing to billion dollar corporations and those who would seek to control the world, then you&#39;re a god damn American in my book...this isn&#39;t one of those Scandinavian countries where we can all trace our ancestors to the same five families, what brings us together is a kindred spirit for goodness and collective desire to make our community and the world a better place for all of humankind. Thank you.</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Absolutely, I&#39;ll save this comment box for later, is there anything in particular you want to talk about regarding 9/11? I&#39;m not some self-proclaimed know-it-all, I love hearing different perspectives and challenging my own critical thinking skills, I&#39;ll probably have some questions for you as well! I guess I&#39;ll get the ball rolling, the biggest red flag for me personally is how conveniently some of the connections were established by the 9/11 commission linking Al Queda and OBL to the attacks, the recovery of passports specifically had me thinking....I could imagine a passport or other items surviving the impact and being found amongst the rubble, but to find the passport just hours after the plane hit, and to thankfully have the passport still in recognizable condition and turned over to an FBI agent that same day, it is so difficult for me to imagine a scenario where that passport is recovered by the authorities so quickly.</p>

When you&#39;re saying they found the passport in the rubble are you sure you&#39;re not mistaking it for the authorities checking the records in order to identify the hijackers?

<p>Here&#39;s the quote from that report :</p>

<p>&quot;109 The passport was recovered by NYPD Detective Yuk H. Chin from a male passerby in a business suit,
about 30 years old. The passerby left before being identified, while debris was falling from WTC 2. The
tower collapsed shortly thereafter. The detective then gave the passport to the FBI on 9/11. See FBI report,
interview of Detective Chin, Sept. 12, 2001.&quot;</p>

<p>Here is Susan Ginsberg&#39;s statement on the al Suqami passport from the 9/11 Commission hearings:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>MS. SUSAN GINSBURG: Beginning with passports. Four of the hijackers passports have survived in whole or in part. Two were recovered from the crash site of United Airlines flight 93 in Pennsylvania. These are the passports of Ziad Jarrah and Saeed al Ghamdi. One belonged to a hijacker on American Airlines flight 11. This is the passport of Satam al Suqami. A passerby picked it up and gave it to a NYPD detective shortly before the World Trade Center towers collapsed. A fourth passport was recovered from luggage that did not make it from a Portland flight to Boston on to the connecting flight which was American Airlines flight 11. This is the passport of Abdul Aziz al Omari&quot;&gt;  <a href="http://govinfo.library.unt.edu/911/archive/hearing7/9-11Commission_Hearing_2004-01-26.htm">Source</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>In 1932 Mussolini wrote (with the help of Giovanni Gentile) and entry for the Italian Encyclopedia on the definition of fascism. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Fascism, the more it considers and observes the future and the development of humanity quite apart from political considerations of the moment, believes neither in the possibility nor the utility of perpetual peace. It thus repudiates the doctrine of Pacifism -- born of a renunciation of the struggle and an act of cowardice in the face of sacrifice. War alone brings up to its highest tension all human energy and puts the stamp of nobility upon the peoples who have courage to meet it. All other trials are substitutes, which never really put men into the position where they have to make the great decision -- the alternative of life or death....</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Mossad and its American associates are the obvious culprits. Who benefits from the crime? The attacks against the twin towers started at 8:45 a.m. and four flights are diverted from their assigned air space and no air traffic controller sounds the alarm. And no Air Force jets scramble until 10 a.m. That also smacks of a small scale Air Force rebellion, a coup against the Pentagon perhaps? Radars are jammed, transponders fail. No IFF -- friend or foe identification -- challenge. In Pakistan, if there is no response to IFF, jets are instantly scrambled and the aircraft is shot down with no further questions asked. This was clearly an inside job. Bush was afraid and rushed to the shelter of a nuclear bunker. He clearly feared a nuclear situation. Who could that have been? Will that also be hushed up in the investigation, like the Warren report after the Kennedy assassination?</p>

<p>The whole world already knows this. This is a simple restatement of what everybody already knows.</p>

<p>Everywhere except in America, where Jewish dominated media envelops everyone in a poisoned darkness, everybody knows that Jewish kingpins pulled off 9/11 as an excuse for making war on every obstacle to their world financial hegemony, and killing as many non-Jews as possible in the process to further consolidate their domination of the whole world.</p>

<p>This widening war on the Islamic world, already responsible for millions of unnecessary deaths, is a direct result of the 9/11 hoax, everything based on false spin concocted by Jewish strategists not for U.S. best interests, but for the demonic master plan of the Jewish Sanhedrin, which rules the Jewish moneymen who buy the presidents and the generals, to kill or enslave the rest of the world. They control you, whether you want to admit or not. They control your bank account. And they make you support their insane war program by all this wall-to-wall patriotic spin.</p>

<p>The totally Jewish-controlled U.S. media have long ago suspended their journalistic capabilities in favor of blatant cheerleading about their favorite subject - Muslim terrorists. Every day they urge you to kill them. If there ever was a systemic hate crime, this is it.</p>

<p>Yet, as the infamous list of the 19 hijackers was released by the FBI two days after the infamous event, and except for two feeble-minded patsies, no other perpetrator has ever been arrested for the greatest crime in American history, what kind of conclusions are we to draw from the fact that all of the people who were in charge of America when this dark day happened, instead of being fired for incompetence, were promoted and allowed to continue their criminal activity?</p>

<p>What does all this say about the American mind?</p>

<p>It is not functioning, thanks to the poisoned blanket of U.S. media, and a deliberately twisted educational system that has produced killer Jewish robots instead of fully invested philosophically clean humans.</p>

<p>Every cop in the world should be brought up on charges of willful obstruction of justice for not blowing the whistle on President George Bush, Vice President Dick Cheney, and all their Jewish handlers - in the White House, in the Congress, in the media, and most especially in the banks) for their stunningly criminal behavior in both lying about the events and implementing a totally illegal coverup of the crime scenes.</p>

<p>But the Jewish judges atop the U.S. legal system said it was all OK, and the media, led by the New York Times and CNN, never mentioned all those Jewish fingerprints visible in the pyroclastic dust covering the disintegrated corpses in the rubble of the Twin Towers.</p>

<p>In an interview only a mere weeks after 9/11, Hamid Gul - former head of Pakistani intelligence (ISI) from 1987-1989 - told Arnaud de Borchgrave, United Press International, of who he thinks was behind the attacks. Here are a few exceprts from the transcript:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>De Borchgrave: So who did Black Sept. 11?</p>

<p>Gul: Mossad and its accomplices. The U.S. spends $40 billion a year on its 11 intelligence agencies. That&#39;s $400 billion in 10 years. Yet the Bush Administration says it was taken by surprise. I don&#39;t believe it. Within 10 minutes of the second twin tower being hit in the World Trade Center CNN said Osama bin Laden had done it. That was a planned piece of disinformation by the real perpetrators. It created an instant mindset and put public opinion into a trance, which prevented even intelligent people from thinking for themselves.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://www.upi.com/UPI-interview-with-Hamid-Gul/60031280349846/">https://www.upi.com/UPI-interview-with-Hamid-Gul/60031280349846/</a></p>

<p>Immediately after the attacks Bin Laden was interviewed by Pakistani newspaper Ummat. When asked if he was involved in the attacks he stated:</p>

<p>&quot;I have already said that I am not involved in the 11 September attacks in the United States. As a Muslim, I try my best to avoid telling a lie. I had no knowledge of these attacks, nor do I consider the killing of innocent women, children and other humans as an appreciable act. Islam strictly forbids causing harm to innocent women, children and other people. Such a practice is forbidden even in the course of a battle.&quot;</p>

<p>He went on to say:</p>

<p>&quot;In the same way, whether it is President Bush or any other U.S. President, they cannot bring Israel to justice for its human rights abuses or to hold it accountable for such crimes. What is this? Is it not that there exists a government within the government in the United States? That secret government must be asked as to who carried out the attacks.&quot;</p>

<p>He further goes on to state:</p>

<p>&quot;I have already said that we are not hostile to the United States. We are against the [U.S. Government] system, which makes other nations slaves of the United States, or forces them to mortgage their political and economic freedom. This system is totally in the control of the American Jews, whose first priority is Israel, not the United States. It is clear that the American people are themselves the slaves of the Jews and are forced to live according to the principles and laws laid down by them. So the punishment should reach Israel. In fact, it is Israel, which is giving a blood bath to innocent Muslims and the U.S. is not uttering a single word.&quot;</p>

<p>You know all this is true. You know you are living a lie every day, by accepting what the TV robots tell you is true.</p>

<p>Yet you wring your hands and kvetch that you don&#39;t know what to do, when in fact you do. You just don&#39;t have the courage to do it, because you&#39;re a robotized American dreckdroid, who goes out and kills other people for reasons simply because you have been ordered to by those who control you. Despicable. You are despicable, because you don&#39;t have the courage to say what you clearly know, even though you about to lose everything you ever loved because of your failure to say what you know and confront the beast. And now it&#39;s too big to stop.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great post. I believe it to be true. We need more people to come to this conclusion. This is the truth that so many deny every day of their lives. We&#39;ve been lied to our collective faces for a long, long time. Our interests are sold out to greed, our media is used as a tool to manipulate us (the exact opposite of what it should be intended to do), and our teachers and priests have betrayed us. Knowledge and truth are the most precious friends mankind has. Our lives have been void of them for too fucking long.  </p>
