       Well I don't necessarily think Loose Change is the best documentary about 9/11 out there but it strikes me how so many people responds in the same way. Just shows how little credibility the US government has world wide. Even colleagues normally far out right in Norwegian politics gets carried away.

       You should have seen my father's expression when I told him about 9/11 conspiracies over dinner. I then showed him Google Video, and some of the less objectionable parts of Loose Change (Final). Now he's utterly convinced that it was an inside job. He's a smart guy.
      </p>
      <p>
       But then, he also believes that the moon landing was faked, so I don't know what to think.

       you have to admit though, when watching the moon landing it looks pretty fucking fake because of the video quality. infact it does look like a shitty 60's movie.

       Lol. I don't know if the moon landing was real or not (I wasn't there to witness it personally), but I can say that there is a hell of a lot of difference between getting out of the moon's gravitational well and getting out of a planet's gravitational well.

       that depends on which of the 3 versions of Loose Change you have seen.  The first two suck ass!  Final Cut was just released and is actually a whole new film with new footage and narrative.  I liked it much better for it gave credible sourcing and avoided speculation
Better Films than Loose Change are:
Fabled Enemies,
Terrorstorm,
Everybody's Gotta Learn Sometime,
Press For Truth,
In Their Own Words,
Truth Rising,
9/11 Mysteries,
Improbable Collapse,
Blueprint For Truth, and many others

       Loose change ignores certain key facts.  The best documentary I have seen on 911 is 911 missing links.  Alex jones won't even touch on certain key facts about the Israelis involvement.

       Loose Change brings up more questions then answers, and there´s not many good answers to all the strange things that happend on that fatal day 9/11. But all questions must up on teh table. It´s a good dokumetry...

       "Loose Change" is what's called "partial hangout". They give you a good dose of truth to gain your confidence, then lead you away from the actual perps.  A plane DID hit the Pentagon.  And it was the Israelis who perpetrated 9/11.

       So you prefer to believe that 19 terrorists armed with nothing but box cutters managed to hijack 4 airplanes, got past the Norad air defence network and planted them into 2 buildings that both collapsed even though they were designed to withstand an impact from a commercial airliner.

       Wow, it was nice to meet you Mr. Cheney, because the fact you "know it" must mean you are privy to information the average person hasn't got access to. You need to question things more rather than just accept the lie. The "official" story isn't even plausible much less believable.

       Maybe they could take an impact, but they didn't include the effects of the jet fuel into the equation. It was that that weakened the supports enough to cause the towers to collapse.

       You people are always so overwhelmingly arrogant. You truly believe that it is not possible to question the official story and yet come out largely agreeing with it. When you say "Question things" you don't really mean question things, you mean "Agree with us, for we are correct". Well, fuck that, and fuck you for suggesting as such. Because the fact of the matter is, I did question it - for a long time, I was just another troofer, then I carried on questioning it and finding other evidence, and came to my own conclusion. One that, by chance, thinks the attacks were planned and executed by pissed off Muslims.

       FAIL (again) - The building is designed to withstand fire and there is no other case in the history of the world where a fire has brought down a tall building of that kind. Jet fuel (kerosene) does not burn at a hot enough temperature to melt steel and cause the structure to collapse, if this was the case, demolition companies would save a hell of a lot of money on explosives by bringing buildings in a controlled manner down with fire.

       Troofer? lol. Listen, you may find me to be arrogant, but you sir are naieve to the facts. There is more evidence to suggest that things aren't as published in the official story than evidence exists to prove the official story. I am not a truther at all, I am just a person who has spent a lot of time looking into the events of 9/11 and a lot of it is inconsitant with the story that the government released. I can't make you change your mind, and I respect your opinion. However, you must come to terms with the fact that the official story DOES contain a lot of inconsistencies and lies which have been exposed.

       How do you explain the fact that a number of the accused hijackers are still alive? how did passports from the hijackers survive the impact and not incinerate? Comon man, if you asked these questions then you would be upmodding me, your just upset because you want to believe the lie because its more comforting the think that it was foreign insurgents rather than your own damn government.

       "Loose Change" is what's called "partial hangout". They give you a good dose of truth to gain your confidence, then lead you away from the actual perps.  A plane DID hit the Pentagon.  And it was the Israelis who perpetrated 9/11.
