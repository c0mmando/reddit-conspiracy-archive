    <div class="md"><p>that depends on which of the 3 versions of Loose Change you have seen.  The first two suck ass!  Final Cut was just released and is actually a whole new film with new footage and narrative.  I liked it much better for it gave credible sourcing and avoided speculation
Better Films than Loose Change are:
Fabled Enemies,
Terrorstorm,
Everybody&#39;s Gotta Learn Sometime,
Press For Truth,
In Their Own Words,
Truth Rising,
9/11 Mysteries,
Improbable Collapse,
Blueprint For Truth, and many others</p>

<p>You people are always so overwhelmingly arrogant. You truly believe that it is not possible to question the official story and yet come out largely agreeing with it. When you say &quot;Question things&quot; you don&#39;t really mean question things, you mean &quot;Agree with us, for we are correct&quot;. Well, fuck that, and fuck you for suggesting as such. Because the fact of the matter is, I did question it - for a long time, I was just another troofer, then I carried on questioning it and finding other evidence, and came to my own conclusion. One that, by chance, thinks the attacks were planned and executed by pissed off Muslims. </p>

<p>FAIL (again) - The building is designed to withstand fire and there is no other case in the history of the world where a fire has brought down a tall building of that kind. Jet fuel (kerosene) does not burn at a hot enough temperature to melt steel and cause the structure to collapse, if this was the case, demolition companies would save a hell of a lot of money on explosives by bringing buildings in a controlled manner down with fire. </p>

<p>Troofer? lol. Listen, you may find me to be arrogant, but you sir are naieve to the facts. There is more evidence to suggest that things aren&#39;t as published in the official story than evidence exists to prove the official story. I am not a truther at all, I am just a person who has spent a lot of time looking into the events of 9/11 and a lot of it is inconsitant with the story that the government released. I can&#39;t make you change your mind, and I respect your opinion. However, you must come to terms with the fact that the official story DOES contain a lot of inconsistencies and lies which have been exposed.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>the attacks were planned and executed by pissed off Muslims.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How do you explain the fact that a number of the accused hijackers are still alive? how did passports from the hijackers survive the impact and not incinerate? Comon man, if you asked these questions then you would be upmodding me, your just upset because you want to believe the lie because its more comforting the think that it was foreign insurgents rather than your own damn government.
