    <div class="md"><p>Thats what im saying, even if you don&#39;t believe pizzagate because it is indeed a bunch of stringed information from the net;  Then why did a guy who appeared on Megyn Kellys show did not have a legitimate reason to meet with obama. Infact all through the year.</p>

<p>Can&#39;t give a legitimate reason why his shop is next to besta pizza, why he met with obama, why his exbf is the head of media matters</p>

<p>At your very worst, pizzagate is true, best case though? Best case is that the entire street is operating as a money laundering front</p>

<p>But the republicans and the leadership! Alleging for years how liberals are trying to make frogs into gayfrogs,that democrats are pushing &quot;satanist&quot; values like incest, pedophilia and beastality.</p>

<p>And the republicans won&#39;t touch it? Suddenly worrying about the dems PR huh?The thing they&#39;ve been saying for years while pizzagate allegations are floating around and NOTHING. It stinks to high heaven that republicans don&#39;t wanna investigate this.</p>

<p>So you have Alex Jones and Fox and some extreme conservatives alleging the things you talked about, and then there&#39;s some less extreme that act like they&#39;re the Christian party with morals.  They&#39;re not better people that anyone that&#39;s not a Republican, they just try to make people think that.</p>

<p>The reality is, there&#39;s nothing to investigate, and they&#39;re not even trying to score political points.  Trust me, if they wanted to try to make Obama and Hillary look bad, they would.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m sure I&#39;m not gonna convince you of anything, but I was curious so I looked up Alefantis&#39; meetings with Obama- I found 5 not 4 on the site white-house-logs.insidegov.com, which seems legit. </p>

<p>Based on the info there it doesn&#39;t seem like Alefantis &#39;met&#39; with Obama in the sense of sitting down with him and discussing something. Of the 5 visits, Alefantis&#39; groups numbered 758, 498, 19, 4, 4. The larger numbers to me indicate big dinners or meet-and-greets, the parties of 4 are labeled as tours of the White House, and they were not personally hosted by Obama. I looked up a couple of his companions for those, 1 was a photographer and the other (I think, a couple different people with the same name) was an assistant to a Congressperson or something. </p>

<p>But more tellingly, if you look at all visits hosted by Obama, there were tons of them, sometimes more than one in a day and often with dozens or hundreds of people. So to the degree that Alefantis &#39;met&#39; with Obama, so did many thousands of other people who were not policy experts or Senators. Keep in mind Bush did not readily give up his visitor logs, and Trump has generally avoided it (I believe- might be wrong).  If you looked at visitor logs for Trump&#39;s White House or his place in Florida, I suspect you would see a lot of similar big events.</p>

<p>As for why a pizzeria owner would be at the White House for these events, I believe he owns two pretty well-known restaurants and an art gallery. He seems to be a popular figure in DC, labeled in the top 50 most powerful in DC by GQ a few years ago, for whatever that&#39;s worth. </p>

<p>Again I&#39;m not hoping to change your mind, but if you&#39;re curious about a different viewpoint from a doubter (but not a &#39;shill&#39; in any sense of the word), I don&#39;t know much about the whole conspiracy but it seems much more likely that a popular figure in the art and food scene would go to large events which were common, than him organizing a prostitution ring with Obama or whatever the theory is. One just seems much more believable than the other, by a huge margin.  </p>

<p>All of what you said is plausible, but so are pizzagate allegations. No republicans want to investigate.  The geopolitical norm is smashed with this one issue. Why don&#39;t republicans wanna drag the dems through mud just to have the dems clear the allegations?</p>

<p>So you have Alex Jones and Fox and some extreme conservatives alleging the things you talked about, and then there&#39;s some less extreme that act like they&#39;re the Christian party with morals.  They&#39;re not better people that anyone that&#39;s not a Republican, they just try to make people think that.</p>

<p>The reality is, there&#39;s nothing to investigate, and they&#39;re not even trying to score political points.  Trust me, if they wanted to try to make Obama and Hillary look bad, they would.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know why Alefantis was at the White House, but they weren&#39;t one-on-one meetings, and anyway, you don&#39;t get to decide people are guilty of something and expect them to prove they&#39;re not.  You&#39;re making the accusation and the burden of proof is on you.</p>
