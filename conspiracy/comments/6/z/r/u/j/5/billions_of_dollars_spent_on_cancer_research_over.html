  You are dealing with protein factories within human DNA which is at its understanding is in its infancy.  I guess people to expect that suddenly one day, instead of research, someone just says, &quot;Oh shit, how can we have been so stupid and just using baking soda to cure all cancer&quot; ot something like that.  Immense amount of research need to go into figuring out how human biology works.  Should a company charge 100s of thousands for treatment?  Hard question. Should they go bankrupt curing people until the company exists?  That&#39;s a whole different question.</p>

<p>Living older, yes.  Just another silly question for you.  What private company will invest 10s of billions to decode the human protein factory at the DNA level to understand the how and why of cancer, to then just ignore that cost of that when pricing a drug?  Should a drug cost 1000 a pill?  No, should the company bankrupt itself to not do so?  If that was the business model, there would be many more dead people and lots less research, unless you can show us how your model works in this case?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Saw this on New, just thought I&#39;d chime in.</p>

<p>Cancer rates are increasing worldwide because the world population is increasing. The biggest increase in population is in poor countries where getting cancer is more likely.</p>

<p>On your second point about prevention  I&#39;m guessing you&#39;re talking about a conspiracy by drug companies to not find a cure so they can keep people buying drugs for the rest of their lives and increase their profits. But.. people who get cancer dont, on average, live long lives compared to people who have something like a mental health problem, where maybe big pharma is putting people who could be &#39;cured&#39; on a lifetime of medication (drugs that in the long term worsen their condition as well).</p>

<p>In terms of cancer though there is no conspiracy, Its just a fucking horrible thing to treat no matter how much money you throw at it. And obviously prevention is part of the solution.</p>

<p>That soundbite is designed to misinform, Pancreatic Cancer kills the majority within a year, Steve Jobs lived 7 years, his life ended prematurely after he received both chemotherapy and radiotherapy.</p>

<p>Also the soundbite makes it sound like all the famous people who receive Chemo and Radiotherapy actually get cured and don&#39;t still die of Cancer.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>when every official cancer expert eschews any type of natural remedy, you get a system that is broken in a fundamental way that has very little chance of curing cancer.</p>

<p>If you get cancer go on a keto diet, take a ton of fresh garlic, Pepper+Turmeric, Mushroom/watercress smoothies, plenty of iodine, D, C, D. Lots of Ginger.</p>

<p>Take everything that  has anticancer potential. Don&#39;t rely on a system that is proven to kill 90% of it&#39;s patients over a 5 year period. Chemo is worse than the disease.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Holy fuck all this misinformation in this thread. Cancer is a catch-all term for a huge number of diseases caused by uncontrolled cell replication, and most can be cured if you can catch it early enough. Let&#39;s take melanoma for example. It&#39;s easy to deal with when it&#39;s still just a dark spot on the skin, but let it sit and it makes its way to your brain. Then there&#39;s leukemia, which involves white blood cells. How does one target only the cancerous cells while leaving the good ones untouched when they&#39;re all mixed together in the bloodstream? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Have you ever heard of Ryke Geerd Hamer? He has a theory about the cause and cure for cancer that I believe is correct.</p>

<p>In short, &#39;cancer&#39; is a natural process of tissue growth in the body that is a reaction to a certain mental/emotional crisis. As long as the crisis is unresolved, the &#39;cancer&#39; tissue grows. But when the crisis is resolved, the tissue is eliminated naturally by the body.</p>

<p>For example, a person has a strong fear of dying, or not getting enough oxygen, and the body responds by producing more tissue in the lungs in order to absorb more oxygen. As long as the sense of threat or crisis remains, then the tissue may grow until it ultimately kills the person. But if the crisis or fear is dealt with, then the cancer will cease to grow and then be eliminated.</p>

<p>His approach to cancer treatment is referred to as the German New Medicine. It is widely dismissed and slandered, but that actually to me makes it even more interesting. :-)</p>
