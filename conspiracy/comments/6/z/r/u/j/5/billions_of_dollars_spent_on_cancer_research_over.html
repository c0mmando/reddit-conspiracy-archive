       Cancer increasing due to people living longer and more toxins introduced into people's lives.  Cancer "cure" as a pure generic cure is a long time away
  You are dealing with protein factories within human DNA which is at its understanding is in its infancy.  I guess people to expect that suddenly one day, instead of research, someone just says, "Oh shit, how can we have been so stupid and just using baking soda to cure all cancer" ot something like that.  Immense amount of research need to go into figuring out how human biology works.  Should a company charge 100s of thousands for treatment?  Hard question. Should they go bankrupt curing people until the company exists?  That's a whole different question.

       Living older, yes.  Just another silly question for you.  What private company will invest 10s of billions to decode the human protein factory at the DNA level to understand the how and why of cancer, to then just ignore that cost of that when pricing a drug?  Should a drug cost 1000 a pill?  No, should the company bankrupt itself to not do so?  If that was the business model, there would be many more dead people and lots less research, unless you can show us how your model works in this case?

       Saw this on New, just thought I'd chime in.
      </p>
      <p>
       Cancer rates are increasing worldwide because the world population is increasing. The biggest increase in population is in poor countries where getting cancer is more likely.
      </p>
      <p>
       On your second point about prevention  I'm guessing you're talking about a conspiracy by drug companies to not find a cure so they can keep people buying drugs for the rest of their lives and increase their profits. But.. people who get cancer dont, on average, live long lives compared to people who have something like a mental health problem, where maybe big pharma is putting people who could be 'cured' on a lifetime of medication (drugs that in the long term worsen their condition as well).
      </p>
      <p>
       In terms of cancer though there is no conspiracy, Its just a fucking horrible thing to treat no matter how much money you throw at it. And obviously prevention is part of the solution.

       Most people I think see cancer as a virus or bacteria where it can be cured. They dont get that it is literally part of your body fighting itself.

       A lot of people believe that a cure would be a one-size fits all type of situation. Finding a cure for cancer that developed in one part of your body doesn't mean it would cure cancers that originated elsewhere. A finding like that would absolutely help, but it wouldn't cure all types of cancer. Even cancers that originate in the same part of the body may act different from person to person.

       Yep, we rely on our immune system to fight off most diseases. That's why AIDS, which directly cripples the immune system is hard as hell to treat. Similarly the immune system cannot recognise our own cells as an external threat.
      </p>
      <p>
       Cancer is our own cells dividing uncontrollably, anything that kills cancer cells will similarly damage other cells within our body.

       Do you remember Jerry Lewis and Muscular Dystrophy?  Same thing.  That guy raised millions and millions of dollars.  If the thing was cured the funding source would dry up.  Simple as that.

       cancer is not even what people think it is....   its just a catch all term.
      </p>
      <p>
       many cancers are preventable and cureable...   don't believe big pharma lies.   if you want to cure your "cancer"  all you have to do is eliminate the cause of it.

       Our immune systems fight off Cancer every day, so for a Cancer to grow it is a sign that your immune system is not doing it's job properly.  The problem with Chemotherapy and Radiotherapy is that they destroy the immune system, so make it unlikely that we'll recover fully.

       You're right that's it's not a common cold, but cancer is still basically bad cells that your body misses in its everyday fight against the numerous bad cells developing in your body. Eventually, your body like all machines will cease working at 100% efficiency, ultimately letting cancerous cells survive and thus... cancer.

       therre are loads of people who have got over cancer by looking at their lifestyle and making the correct changes.  its the people who would rather go to doctors for drugs and surgery who die from cancer.
      </p>
      <p>
       i'm not being an ass ii have first hand experience of this... i want peaople to have hope.  cancer is not a death sentence its not even what people think it is... you can have a tiny bit of skin cancer is not the same as other cancers.   just found out what caused that cancer and eliminate that CAUSE.  the cancer can and will be healed.

       People have to learn to take charge of their own lives and have confidence in their own body's ability to heal itself if given the kind of help that genuinely strengthens and promotes good health and vitality.
      </p>
      <p>
       Psychology also has a tremendous amount to do with it with far too many people that aren't simply terrified of dying but also unhappy with and stressed-out by the very lives they're so worried about losing.
      </p>
      <p>
       One thing is certain, you have to lose the life that made you sick one way or the other. If you haven't or aren't willing to create a completely new life for yourself with a positive and grateful outlook on every day it brings you, it won't be long before you're pushing up daisies.

       The same medical disinformation and pressure as everywhere else. Same thing for technology. Look at china and their "wonder" em drive that will take people to mars in a matter of weeks: they just had enough of censorship and decided to do it.

       You are missing some facts.  Jobs had a form of pancreatic cancer that was very rare.  Like 5% of pancreatic cancers are the type he had.  It is very slow growing, which is why he lasted years versus one year, and since it is so slow growing surgery can treat it very effectively.
      </p>

       He tried his natural method, regretted it, and then died.

       Don't you know they're simply more "useless eaters" just like everyone else as far as the PTB are concerned. Taking up space and using up resources of "their world". It's not simply population control, they want the entire world for themselves and only as many slaves as they need to serve their every whim.

       when every official cancer expert eschews any type of natural remedy, you get a system that is broken in a fundamental way that has very little chance of curing cancer.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you get cancer go on a keto diet, take a ton of fresh garlic, Pepper+Turmeric, Mushroom/watercress smoothies, plenty of iodine, D, C, D. Lots of Ginger.
      </p>
      <p>
       Take everything that  has anticancer potential. Don't rely on a system that is proven to kill 90% of it's patients over a 5 year period. Chemo is worse than the disease.

       Holy fuck all this misinformation in this thread. Cancer is a catch-all term for a huge number of diseases caused by uncontrolled cell replication, and most can be cured if you can catch it early enough. Let's take melanoma for example. It's easy to deal with when it's still just a dark spot on the skin, but let it sit and it makes its way to your brain. Then there's leukemia, which involves white blood cells. How does one target only the cancerous cells while leaving the good ones untouched when they're all mixed together in the bloodstream?

       Have you ever heard of Ryke Geerd Hamer? He has a theory about the cause and cure for cancer that I believe is correct.
      </p>
      <p>
       In short, 'cancer' is a natural process of tissue growth in the body that is a reaction to a certain mental/emotional crisis. As long as the crisis is unresolved, the 'cancer' tissue grows. But when the crisis is resolved, the tissue is eliminated naturally by the body.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example, a person has a strong fear of dying, or not getting enough oxygen, and the body responds by producing more tissue in the lungs in order to absorb more oxygen. As long as the sense of threat or crisis remains, then the tissue may grow until it ultimately kills the person. But if the crisis or fear is dealt with, then the cancer will cease to grow and then be eliminated.
      </p>
      <p>
       His approach to cancer treatment is referred to as the German New Medicine. It is widely dismissed and slandered, but that actually to me makes it even more interesting. :-)

       You are missing some facts.  Jobs had a form of pancreatic cancer that was very rare.  Like 5% of pancreatic cancers are the type he had.  It is very slow growing, which is why he lasted years versus one year, and since it is so slow growing surgery can treat it very effectively.
