<p>Google Sky Map is censoring Nibiru:

<p>It&#39;s going to cross our sky within the next week or two, and black out the sun.  A &quot;suprise&quot; eclipse - for 3 hours, according to some.</p>

<p>Further, this planet is even on the NASA website:
<a href="https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/planetx">https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/planetx</a></p>

<p>Of course, they downplay it as &quot;hypothetical&quot;.</p>

<p>Still, I disagree with Step2TheJep that this is a distraction. I think it&#39;s a central element of the Great Cycle, but I&#39;m not convinced that &quot;THE END IS NIGH!&quot; or whatever. I can see additional earthquakes and flooding and widespread panic, for sure, but nothing we couldn&#39;t recover from. Perhaps I&#39;m just optimisitic.</p>

This is something I have experience with, I did it as a part of a physics laboratory course, and got reasonably close to the accepted value for the gravitation constant.

    <div class="md"><p>Naw, never read the original paper. We had a handout with an explanation of the experiment, and were told to justify the equation relating the angle and the gravitational constant for the static approach to the experiment. The justification for relating the two is actually pretty straightforward. I know that it took quite a while for the system to equilibriate in the original experiment, how long exactly I don&#39;t remember. We let our experiment sit for 4-5 days on an optical table to reduce the impact of vibrations from outside sources. I don&#39;t understand why the length of time would affect the results validity, could you explain?</p>

<p>If you&#39;re interested, I can link you to a procedure for a non-static technique to the experiment, where you essentially &quot;pump&quot; the balance by rotating the larger balls. You can then relate the frequency of oscillations of the balance to the gravitational constant. This technique gives more accurate results (iirc), and can be done in a 2-3 hour session. The math for this one is a bitch though. </p>

<p>How long did you run your experiment for?</p>

<p>How long did Cavendish run his for?  Why?</p>

<p>I&#39;ve seen people repeat the experiment and it goes like this,  first there&#39;s lots of &quot;random movements&quot; that don&#39;t match the equation, so they have to wait for it to &quot;settle&quot;.  Then eventually they&#39;ll see it move to a point they wanted it to move to (according to the equation they&#39;ve been told to match) and declare the experiment a success.  They don&#39;t wait and discover that it carries on moving at random, just until they get what they want. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is a criticism of the experimental method, not of the validity of the derivation of the equation relating the gravitational constant to Theta(D). What is wrong with the underlying <em>principles</em> of the experiment? The equations I presented are a simple combination of Newtons law of Universal Gravitation, and the torque exerted by the tungsten wire holding the balance. Do you not &quot;believe&quot; in the universal law of gravitation, or torque?</p>

<p>Certainly measuring the value of Theta(D) is difficult because of the sensitivity required to get a good measurement, but with proper equipment a lot of the noise can be eliminated. In our experiment, we used a glass enclosed balance to prevent stray air currents from moving the balance, and placed the balance on a gas cushioned table to reduce the impact of of vibrations. The whole setup was in a closed room. We left it there for several days to allow it to equilibriate, and then took the average of Theta(D) over a period of several thousand seconds.  We didn&#39;t cherry pick our data. </p>

<p>Additionally, the driven resonance method, an <em>entirely</em> different way to obtain Theta(D) using the same equipment, gave the same result. This method works by placing the external boom in one position, allowing the internal balance to reach its closest point to the external boom, and then rotating the boom so that the internal balance moves in the opposite direction. This is done until the internal balance reaches resonance, and a plot of time vs the angle of the boom is sinusoidal (the external boom is rotated at the maxima and minima of the sinusoidal plot). By measuring the frequency of oscillations (which is very well defined, either by fitting mathematically or by manually counting the time between peaks), you can determine Theta(D). It would be almost impossible to cherry pick this method because there the frequency of a sinusoidal function is pretty cut and dry, especially if you have a good number of periods. </p>

<p>The fact that the same (or nearly the same) gravitational constant has been experimentally determined by Cavendish, hundreds of replications of the same experiment in the 200 years since are a testament to it&#39;s reproducibility. Other experimental methods have found the same result, see the article below.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v510/n7506/abs/nature13433.html?foxtrotcallback=true">http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v510/n7506/abs/nature13433.html?foxtrotcallback=true</a></p>

<p>It is true that the gravitational constant is one universal constant that we do not know with as much precision as we&#39;d like, but this is due to limitations in our ability to measure something so small, not the <em>underlying principles</em> behind the experiments we perform. Yes, <em>some</em> science is experiment based, but countless physical realities were equations on paper before they were experimentally verified. Theoretical and computational physics/chemistry are both very real, non-experiment based disciplines. Please don&#39;t condescendingly tell me what science is and isn&#39;t. I have a B.A. in physics, a B.S. in chemistry, and am working towards PhD in chemistry. I feel like I&#39;ve got a pretty good grasp of the scientific method. </p>

<p>TL;DR: Just read the post.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How do you explain multiple methods returning the same result? The driven resonance, the static method, <em>and</em> cold atom interferometry? </p>

<p>Attached is a plot of our static method results, we averaged the angles found between 0 and ~9000 seconds, or 1.5 hours. The maximum difference between a &quot;max&quot; value of the balance angle and a &quot;min&quot; value of the balance angle is less than 0.2 milliradians. This is absurdly small. <em>and</em> this was consistent over multiple trials. I&#39;d say our results are plenty for statistical significance. The large spike at the end corresponds to us entering the room the experiment was housed in.</p>

<p>You still have not provided any evidence of your claims whatsoever beyond &quot;you&#39;ll find what you want to find&quot;. Show me why the math is wrong. Show me where I cherry picked my data (hell, show me where the hundreds of people who have reproduced this experiment have cherry picked their data). Show me why the underlying principles are wrong. Why did Cavendish get so close to the now accepted value of G hundreds of years ago? Why are hundreds of undergrads able to replicate his experiment with reasonible accuracy and precision every year? Why is a cold atom interferometry experiment able to obtain nearly the same result for G?</p>

<p>Probably because it was right. Your lofty arm chair science will never convince anyone because you don&#39;t have any good arguments.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I looked through your comment history and see that you have argued against the Cavendish experiment in the past. I don&#39;t think I will convince you that you are wrong if the arguments I have already presented have not. Instead I offer you this:</p>

<p>Do the experiment yourself. Many universities will have a Cavendish experimental setup that they will allow you to use, as it is probably only used for several weeks a year. Collect the data yourself, write an article, and post it here. Create a compelling evidence based argument. You say</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Science isn&#39;t about debugging equations, it&#39;s about testing hypotheses and being able to repeat them.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So test your hypothesis. My hypothesis was that the math was correct, and my results backed this up. Your hypothesis is that the math is incorrect, or that this angle cannot be accurately measured. Test it.</p>

<p>If you are gaslighting people on this subreddit intentionally with your denial of the Cavendish experiment, I have to say bravo, you&#39;ve done a wonderful job. If not, I suggest you take a good long look at what you believe in and why you believe in it. Why do you believe a blog author over a peer reviewed scientific journal. Why do you dismiss scientific results because they sound crazy. </p>

<p>I think that for many conspiracy theorists, it&#39;s comforting to believe that there&#39;s a &quot;plan&quot; or &quot;reason&quot; for everything, even if it is nefarious. It can be more comforting to believe that some especially baffling science is falsified, rather than having to accept that reality is just <em>that</em> crazy. For other conspiracy theorists, I believe that preservation of their ego is the driving factor. They want to believe that they are smart enough to see beyond what the sheep see, that they are part of the intellectual elite. I think that this is the group that you belong to. Take a look at your scientific achievements, your credentials, etc. Look at what you have contributed to science, the kind of thing you could put on a resume. Is there much to speak of? It&#39;s easy to be a science skeptic online, but far harder to actually produce a scientific result of meaning in the real world. Which group do you think you fall into?</p>

<p>I don&#39;t expect an answer to any of these questions, just hoping to foster some self reflection. Take a look at where you are currently, what kind of job you have, what kind of work you&#39;re doing. I&#39;m working towards a PhD in chemistry, and hoping to make a change, however tiny, in whatever field I wind up entering. I&#39;m doing research that makes the world just a tiny bit better. What kind of positive change are you making?</p>

We did have to use an electronic system to measure the angle of the masses off center, as the angle of our balance only changed by a few milliradians.

<p>and yet we are the most open society in the world.. how scary is that?</p>

<p>and for &quot;planet x&quot; if it&#39;s a brown dwarf it would be near impossible for an amateur to spot. </p>

<p>The earth is rotating constantly on its axis, while it travels around the sun. No matter where it&#39;s supposedly located at some point it would be lined up with an amateur astronomers lens.</p>

<p>This clearly illustrates the real conspiracy here. Fuck RT news.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You do not know how look angles work, nor the axis and rotation and orbital path of earth. You do not need to be anywhere near an area to eventually see what will be there eventually, unless for months the rotational speed has been fully matching the EXACT blind spot off the tip of Antarctica as the earth circles the sun.</p>

<p>It would have to be matching rotational and orbital speeds of earth, meaning at BILLIONS OF MILES AWAY it would have to be going fast enough to match the earth&#39;s perfect orbital plane around our sun, and as we&#39;re moving at 67,000 miles per hour around the sun, the extended orbit of Nibiru at 60 billion miles away staying up with us in our blindspot in the highly improbably orbit would need to have an insane orbit to match our axial tilt and an astronomical speed to match the 67,000 mph extended to 60 billion miles.</p>

<p>Basically, the planet would need to be sentient to able to control itself for it&#39;s insane orbit to be even remotely possible, especially at the RIDICULOUS speeds it would have to perform that oval-helical orbit at.</p>

<p>Which it isn&#39;t.</p>

<p>It would be a good explanation of our planets weird weather phenomenon over the last few years, but the size would surely have to be massive to affect such a thing I would have thought. Then surely there would also be other effects on gravity/ electro magnetic field of the planet?</p>

<p>Interesting nonetheless.</p>

<p>I suppose something of that size coming in may well have an effect on our planets gravity /magnetic fields and weather system. Perhaps its time I take another look at the whole thing, thanks everyone for the info.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Brother the lie is so deep.  For countless years we have been conditioned through media and movies that the coming beings will be ET&#39;s, but rather, they are fallen angels from the beginning and we are all about to see the final showdown.

Anything other links would be great too. Always wanted to bone on that kinda stuff. Does this have relation to the Book Of Enoch? What do you know about that?

    <div class="md"><p>Enoch is true and at one time was a part of the Bible.  The origins of the battle in heaven, the fall of the angels, all of it - the deception, the sexual perversion with women, the disembodied nephilim spirits, its all true and it&#39;s all coming to a head and the world will be shaken from what is coming.  All I can say brother is repent now to Christ and try to convince everyone around you that IT IS GOING DOWN as we speak.  No religion, no church, only Christ can save.  He is coming to take His children out of here before it pops off, which I now believe could start as soon as the 16th</p>

<p>I found an old book from the turn of the century that talks about a &#39;spirit orb&#39; that traverses the stars and comes into contact with earth every few thousand years and I sort of wonder whether this is the &#39;spirit planet&#39; the occultist was referring to. He claimed it&#39;s visits were always accompanied by massive spiritual activity and technological advances.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Honestly, I have no idea. I haven&#39;t bought into the whole nibiru story myself, but the basic idea with multidimensional beings/objects is that they can appear invisible and intangible to lower dimensional consciousnesses unless they &#39;want&#39; to be seen.</p>

<p>Think fairies from folk lore. They could make themselves visible or invisible to mortals at will and there was very little a mundane person could do about it in the folklore. The idea is that aliens/gods/djinn/multidimensional high consciousness etc. works much the same way. The highest level entities would be manipulating reality through sheer consciousness and the lower level ones would be utilizing technologies that straight up don&#39;t exist fully on our present plane of existence. I know this all sounds absurd, but I&#39;m just trying to report my limited understanding as best I can.</p>

<p>Presumably nibiru advocates would believe that the planet will either intentionally reveal itself or somehow be forced to reveal itself at some point around September 23rd. It&#39;s gonna be incredibly easy to tell if they&#39;re right and it hardly seems worth worrying about either way because actual spiritual apocalypse events aren&#39;t really the type of thing you should be packing canned goods for anyway, so I see it as more of an amusing thought experiment where I&#39;ll be &#39;pleasantly&#39; surprised if we end up with an unannounced eclipse knocking at our door.</p>

<p>Like you, I would be pleasantly surprised if a massive mystery planet does show up but slightly annoyed if it scrambles the space time continuum, I have things to get done.</p>

<p>It does sort of make me wonder what the chances of a cataclysmic astronomical event involving unknown planetary objects besides asteroids really is.  What if there is some dark body mass out there we can&#39;t see, hurling at us from beyond the plane of the ecliptic?</p>

However, there is a huge telescope in Antarctica which may have better views but their feeds are not accessible.  Why would that be?  Didn&#39;t they use our tax dollars to build it?  Why are they using our tax $ to build cities underground *secretly?&quot;  Forgive me for being suspicious.  </p>

<p>I can&#39;t say w certainty bec we are not being given (possibly) all the info available.  We pieces of facts and this cryptic prophecy --it may mean something else, but it sure seems to fit.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>People stopped listening to me about it because there isn&#39;t a reliable date, I just say sometime before 2022. No one wants to hear it and even if they do, because they haven&#39;t read and researched all the sources, they won&#39;t adopt it into their lives and stop concerning themselves with all this petty material and social bullshit. And it&#39;s not like I&#39;m going to tell everyone &#39;I told you so&#39; when the ocean is a 2km high wall of water rushing over the continent. I&#39;ve just resolved to enjoy the time left with those I love and develop my spiritual self so that I may find balance before we have to reincarnate :).</p>

<p>For the curious, I think this is going to happen because of the following:
- Mayan history which talks of different &#39;suns&#39;. The current sun is old and there will be a new &#39;sun&#39; soon. By that I interpret that the earth will be shifted around so that our sky is different. Also their 2012 calender I don&#39;t feel was supposed to be super accurate, and besides our calander has been messed with by the church so our 2012 probably isn&#39;t the time they predicted anyway.
- The Law of One stated in 1981 that our planet&#39;s time of harvest was somewhere in the next 30-40 years.
- Velikovsky makes a very compelling case that whatever it is comes around every 2600 years, and we are due for the next around now.
- American Indian myths that this world is about the end for the final time. 
- Hindu mythology about the planet going through cataclysmic cycles.
- Evidence of the US government spending billions on creating underground cities that they hope will be able to ride it out. As well as the reports of retired army and navy commanders relocating to higher areas of the States.
- Chinese myths about the planet going through cataclysmic cycles.
- The work of Graham Hancock slowing piecing together the evidence of the previous civilisation before the last cataclysm. </p>

<p>One of these would arouse interest, but this many of them all saying the same thing demands to be listened to. And again, hearing them in passing like this is a lot different to reading entire books on each of them. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Roughly a week before the supposed arrival of Planet X in May 2003, Lieder appeared on KROQ-FM radio in Los Angeles, and <strong>advised listeners to euthanize their pets in anticipation of the event as she had done</strong>.</p>

<p>This led the Fortean Times to conclude that she had put down her dog(s) to save them from further suffering during the Pole Shift.[16] </p>

<p>Later, in a 2004 interview she said that she had euthanized her dog because it was acting aggressively.[17] After the 2003 date passed without incident, Lieder said that it was merely a &quot;white lie ... to fool the establishment.&quot;[18] </p>

<p>She refused to disclose the true date, saying that to do so would give those in power enough time to declare martial law and trap people in cities during the shift, leading to their deaths.[19] </p>

<p>Though Lieder herself has not specified a new date for the object&#39;s return, many groups have taken up her idea and cited their own dates. One frequently cited date was December 21, 2012. This date had many apocalyptic associations, as it was the end of a cycle (baktun) in the long count in the Mayan calendar. </p>

<p>Several writers published books connecting the encounter with 2012.[20] Despite that date having passed, many websites still contend that Nibiru/Planet X is en route to Earth.[21]</p>

<p>In 2012, Lieder claimed that U.S. President Barack Obama futilely attempted to announce the presence of Nibiru near the sun.[22] After 2012, she claimed that several world leaders had intended to announce the presence of Nibiru near the sun on October 20, 2014. </p>

<p>Two weeks after the supposed date of announcement, she claimed that it did not occur because of consternation amongst the establishment.[23]</p>

<p>In 2017, a conspiracy theorist named David Meade revived the Nibiru cataclysm by tying it to various Biblical prophecies and passages, which he claimed foretold its arrival in that year. </p>

<p>Initially predicting the arrival for October, he later revised it to 23 September, citing the solar eclipse of August 21, 2017 as a harbinger. His claims proved provocative enough to appear in the British press.[24][25]</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No one has brought up the association with the cryptic biblical prophecies of Revelation 12.  It is quite amazing all these heavenly bodies will align in a way never before seen in history, and the mention of the dragon, which is suspected to represent nibiru. The natural disasters prophesied in Revelation would make sense with this physical configuration of heavenly bodies. On 9/23/17 from Jerusalem, it is predicted by astronomy calculations, that Leo will come up in the morning horizon followed by 3 planets (Venus, mercury and mars).  The sun will follow and be at the shoulder of the next constellation, Virgo. Jupiter will be between the &quot;legs&quot; of Virgo. And the moon will be at the end of the procession, at Virgo&#39;s &quot;feet.&quot;  The dragon  is supposed to appear near Jupiter, which would attract nibiru because of its greater mass (gravitational pull), compared to earth.  Regardless of what else happens or not, this configuration is unprecedented and therefore very significant as a &quot;great sign in the heavens&quot; from God signaling the very brutal last days of earth. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey OP I have a question for you. Why do you trust google? Have you tried to observe the location being censored with some sort of infrared filter on a telescope? I wouldn&#39;t trust google , you may wonder what I mean. Well maybe they censored that location just to feed the fire to the nibaru people. Because after all if you believe in space as nasa tells it then Google and nasa are happy. We all know google is basically a government entity they have many contracts with many different branches including nasa. They rather send you down the niburu rabbit hole than any another different rabbit hole that might make google look bad. </p>

<p>even if there is a niburu or rahu or whatever black sun I don&#39;t think it&#39;s going to crash into earth. We literally have no reason to think that would ever happen. </p>

<p>let me ask you this op , do you think water curves and sticks to a sphere? by some magical force which we can&#39;t explain called gravity? These are experiments that we can&#39;t do, sure you can drop an apple and say it&#39;s gravity. But I say it&#39;s buoyancy. 
Do you believe the pictures we have of earth from space are real? they are all inconsistent and obviously cartoon like. We even have nasa employees saying the photos of earth are photoshopped because they have to be.
Do you ever wonder why we don&#39;t have a 24/7 camera on earth from the moon?
Have you ever seen a real photograph of  a satellite? go ahead google it. you can look at cartoons only. 
We also have no video of the whole earth rotating . The math for curvature doesn&#39;t add up. So many more things. Just look into it before you buy into some skymap from google who is not to be trusted. </p>

Google is govt, NASA was formed to lie to the public, and the censored spot on Google Sky is only there to reinforce the notion that we live on a globe through triple reverse psychology.  the entire reason they created the heliocentric model lie is so they could convince us that the aliens are extra terrestial, when in fact they are INTERDIMENSIONAL.  sound about right?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No you haven&#39;t, because it is impossible. But im not surprised u lied, as it is the only possible defense for the ball. 
Also, there is only one celestial pole, which is fairly obvious as well considering the distinct lack of evidence for the other pole. There is a plethora of information on Polaris and northern star swirls, but when searching southern stars, the information comes to a screeching halt. Almost like they want us to rely on all the information there is for the north pole and just make assumptions and apply it to the south, despite the fact that there is just not as much info on the south as there is for the north. It&#39;s a conspiracy man</p>

<p>Wrong.  </p>

<blockquote>

<p>950 Million people can see it every night.  You don&#39;t seem to know the difference between the celestial poles and the pole stars.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>but when searching southern stars, the information comes to a screeching halt.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Uh, here are 10 amateur timelapses of the South Celestial Pole.  Note the direction of rotation and lack of Northern Constellations like Cassiopea and The Big Dipper.</p>

<p>You want there to be one, but there isn&#39;t.  There is a South Celestial Pole and the earth is round.</p>

<p>Go ahead and explain why BOTH celestial Poles (we&#39;ll just use the North one as an example) <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/flatearth/comments/5d4gvb/flat_earth_cant_explain_why_polaris_is_seen_at_an/">only appear at a height angle equal to your lattitude.</a> This makes no sense on FE but is required on RE.</p>

<p>The IRAS image later turned out to be the Peanut Nebula - the brightest object in infrared, only visible from above our atmosphere. It&#39;s between 390 and 490 light years away and no threat to Earth.
<a href="https://debunkingdoomsday.quora.com/Debunked-The-IRAS-infrared-satellite-found-Nibiru-in-1983">https://debunkingdoomsday.quora.com/Debunked-The-IRAS-infrared-satellite-found-Nibiru-in-1983</a></p>

<p>The &quot;planet 9&quot; does not remotely resemble &quot;Nibiru&quot;. If it exists then it is 200 au from the sun at its closest and currently must be close to the most distant point in its orbit, 1200 au away. By comparison, Neptune is around 30 au from the sun (and Earth is 1 au). From its skies our sun would just be the brightest star in a starry sky during its &quot;daytime&quot;. Such a planet is no conceivable threat to Earth. It is one of many hypotheses and astronomers are searching for distant planets beyond Neptune. So far they haven&#39;t found any. But many think they will eventually. When we find a new planet, it will just be like Neptune, Pluto etc a new addition to the family of our solar system but much much further away or we&#39;d have found it decades ago. It&#39;s no conceivable threat to Earth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If it exists in the universe, with extremely rare exceptions, behavior can be predicted due to the mechanics of the universe.</p>

<p>If someone is saying this is an unknown entity of unknown type, which can or cannot be seen that may or may not even exist, and if it does it may or may not abide by the laws of the physical universe.  Serious.  I have some very nice expensive things to sell you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You do not know how look angles work, nor the axis and rotation and orbital path of earth. You do not need to be anywhere near an area to eventually see what will be there eventually, unless for months the rotational speed has been fully matching the EXACT blind spot off the tip of Antarctica as the earth circles the sun.</p>

<p>It would have to be matching rotational and orbital speeds of earth, meaning at BILLIONS OF MILES AWAY it would have to be going fast enough to match the earth&#39;s perfect orbital plane around our sun, and as we&#39;re moving at 67,000 miles per hour around the sun, the extended orbit of Nibiru at 60 billion miles away staying up with us in our blindspot in the highly improbably orbit would need to have an insane orbit to match our axial tilt and an astronomical speed to match the 67,000 mph extended to 60 billion miles.</p>

<p>Basically, the planet would need to be sentient to able to control itself for it&#39;s insane orbit to be even remotely possible, especially at the RIDICULOUS speeds it would have to perform that oval-helical orbit at.</p>

<p>Which it isn&#39;t.</p>
