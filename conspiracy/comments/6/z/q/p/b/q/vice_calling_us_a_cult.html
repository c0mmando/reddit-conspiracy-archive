<p>There&#39;s a few others that could be Nazis depending on the circumstances.  If you&#39;re a white male and you&#39;re at alt-right rally holding a Nazi flag, then you&#39;re a Nazi.</p>

<p>There&#39;s lots of negative comments about Hillary.  It&#39;s not like some Hillary love fest.  It&#39;s just that most people don&#39;t say she&#39;s a child-eating Satanist.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not true. Many &quot;fair&quot; comments never get approved on politics or world news unless they agree with the narrative. It&#39;s obvious on politics, look, there is zero posts or comments that are from the rightMs perspective, or Pro-Trump, etc.</p>

<p>I have no problem with The Donald because they are are exactly what they claim to be. </p>

<p>Politics pretends it is fair and balanced, that they show both perspectives, and have no agenda. But they hide behind the generalized term politics and pretend to be all inclusive. </p>

<p>If politics was truly fair than the sub&#39;s name would accurately reflect their gatekeeping, such as r/ leftistpolitics, or r/DebbieWassermanFanClub , or r/DNCSeattleMayorAllegedUnderAgeSexualAssaulter</p>

<p>The Donald is strictly pro-Trump, they don&#39;t claim to be anything else, they don&#39;t claim to be r/EveryOnePostYourTrumpOpinion then only allow the positive stuff. </p>

<p>No seriously, the objective here is so clear. Conflate all arguments that go against mainstream thought as conpsiracies, and relate all people who believe any of these together. Believe 9/11 was an inside job? Immediate association with flat earth. Believe theres some dark shit happening at Bohemian Grove?

And lumping us all together is a good tactic for msm. We just have to call out those who are posting conspiracies that have little to no evidence supporting it. That&#39;s my 2¢!</p>

<p>I get it. People who call themselves conspiracy theorists can be dumb/crazy, and so using critical thought and rational consideration is important. You should always be a skeptic (as long as it&#39;s general and not for a specific thing).</p>

<p>But that&#39;s not what this article is advocating. It&#39;s sneering at the very concept of questioning the official narrative. It&#39;s this sort of blind, fanatical belief that is so dangerous. Case in point, he positively sneers at the idea of chemtrails, and while I agree that the average plane isn&#39;t dropping chemicals, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unethical_human_experimentation_in_the_United_States#1950s">THE GOVERNMENT HAS LITERALLY DROPPED CHEMICALS FROM PLANES.</a> It&#39;s been done by the government&#39;s own admittance.</p>

<p>Now, if you want a good primer on how &quot;All the media&quot; might not serve all (or any) of your interests, watch this: <a href="https://youtu.be/AnrBQEAM3rE">Manufacturing Consent</a> </p>

<p>It&#39;s dated, but it&#39;s fairly easy to take the model and extrapolate it for the internet age, at least when it comes to big outlets, or &quot;small&quot; outlets owned by big outlets. If you don&#39;t watch it, then you&#39;ll be the one avoiding the stuff you don&#39;t want to hear. Enjoy!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>From any perspective someone who specializes their time into a subject that requires a lot of reading could be considered a cult member. Conspiracy theory is interesting because even when your proven correct people still act like the stuff never happens or don&#39;t care as most people are only interested in themselves or the image of what they think they project to the outside world aka how they think others see them.  They follow trends and basically allow society to control what they do. Gluten is bad, vegan is good, I should watch keeping up with the kardashians and talk about sports, wear gym clothing all the time so people think I work out, get that masters degree so people think I&#39;m educated, drive a electric car because I care about the future, buy an apple device because it&#39;s a status symbol but argue with people about how it&#39;s actually better then other devices because it&#39;s innovative doesn&#39;t matter if the innovations are years behind everyone else.  The point is they are useful in that state willfully expending money and time to project an image so other people see them as they want to be seen and the people who supply them with the tools get rich. Life is easier to accept in a world where you don&#39;t look at things that might upset you or worry you or make you question things or ignore things that they feel they can&#39;t change.  You can&#39;t change some people perspective on some things even with a mountain of evidence baby fed to them hence the saying you can lead a horse to water but you can&#39;t make them drink it. </p>

<p>Now onto the article it&#39;s not very informative and simply states the lady who was part of a small conspiracy group decided to read up on the topic she pushed for years when a friend stopped believing in it and came to the conclusion it is all fake. It doesn&#39;t go into details of why she thinks it&#39;s fake simply that it&#39;s fake now because I now believe the evidence against it. Yes this small conspiracy theory makes all conspiracy theory fake now lol. Also people in the conspiracy theory communities are cults because they think like each other lol furthest thing from the truth I have ever heard as a lot of theories have different opinions on who is doing it, why it&#39;s being done etc. Vice was bought out years ago and is total crap now</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly!  Some conspiracy theorists are so open minded their brains have fallen out, they will believe anything even if there&#39;s no evidence. And lumping us all together is a good tactic for msm. We just have to call out those who are posting conspiracies that have little to no evidence supporting it. That&#39;s my 2¢!</p>

<p>Murdoch’s 21st Century Fox has procured a 5 per cent stake in Vice Media for $70m (£45m). The deal values the free underground magazine-turned-global entertainment/news brand at $1.4bn.</p>
