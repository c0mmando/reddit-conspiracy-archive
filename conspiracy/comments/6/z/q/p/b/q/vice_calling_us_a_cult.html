       I mean we can have more than one option. If you're going to kill off the congregation, you can at least use new organ fund for a nice spread. Not like a wonky air piano does anything when your dead.

       It's absolutely fucking hilarious that you'd say that.  1920s-1940s germany acronyim, Na-national zi-socialist german workers party.  Calling anyone in the USA a nazi, especially fucking EIGHT of those on this list, you are insane and it gives me little hope for the future knowing you exist.

       There's eight because there's lots of names that are basically the same people.  Neo-Nazi, alt-right, white supremacist, white nationalist, KKK, skinhead, NSDAP, yeah, they're Nazis.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's a few others that could be Nazis depending on the circumstances.  If you're a white male and you're at alt-right rally holding a Nazi flag, then you're a Nazi.

       Seems like they quoted her. The article is about some woman who used to be a conspiracy theorist now isn't and started "educating" conspiracy theorists that chemtrails are not real or something. She also got harassed online by men probably.

       You know, I never thought about it before reading this, but Vice's North Korea coverage is probably responsible for the misinformed and adversarial attitudes held by many 20 and 30 somethings in the US.

       Is it possible to have a cult that is online only? Seems impossible to me.

       If you want to leave the world of online conspiracy, you just stop going to those sites, stop posting on those boards. Easy peasy.

       You can compare them because they are both subreddits on Reddit. Lol.

       And every subreddit has rules. The Donald doesn't allow bashing of the president. Every other sub does. What happens in the "incomparable" r/politics when an article bashing Clinton is posted?

       Every thread in politics that has to do with Trump, there's always a bunch of people saying "but Hillary."  I see those comments.  I see all the comments that say "muh Russia" and "MAGA."
      </p>
      <p>
       There's lots of negative comments about Hillary.  It's not like some Hillary love fest.  It's just that most people don't say she's a child-eating Satanist.

       What if I were to go to the donald and say "ya know, maybe Hillary's not that bad"?  I'd probably be banned in two seconds.

       I don't think you did get banned for that.  Just go to any thread in politics, and there's all kinds of positive Trump comments.  The only people that get banned are the ones being insulting toward other users.

       Not true. Many "fair" comments never get approved on politics or world news unless they agree with the narrative. It's obvious on politics, look, there is zero posts or comments that are from the rightMs perspective, or Pro-Trump, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have no problem with The Donald because they are are exactly what they claim to be.
      </p>
      <p>
       Politics pretends it is fair and balanced, that they show both perspectives, and have no agenda. But they hide behind the generalized term politics and pretend to be all inclusive.
      </p>
      <p>
       If politics was truly fair than the sub's name would accurately reflect their gatekeeping, such as r/ leftistpolitics, or r/DebbieWassermanFanClub , or r/DNCSeattleMayorAllegedUnderAgeSexualAssaulter
      </p>
      <p>
       The Donald is strictly pro-Trump, they don't claim to be anything else, they don't claim to be r/EveryOnePostYourTrumpOpinion then only allow the positive stuff.

       The difference is at politics you actually have to back up any assertions with factual evidence, otherwise it'll be regarded for what it is.
      </p>

       At TD you can pretty much say whatever the heck you want, as long as it's compatible with whatever narrative TD is pushing at that moment.

       No seriously, the objective here is so clear. Conflate all arguments that go against mainstream thought as conpsiracies, and relate all people who believe any of these together. Believe 9/11 was an inside job? Immediate association with flat earth. Believe theres some dark shit happening at Bohemian Grove? Obviously youre in the same exact group as people who believe the Nazis are in Antarctica.

       Exactly!  Some conspiracy theorists are so open minded their brains have fallen out, they will believe anything even if there's no evidence. And lumping us all together is a good tactic for msm. We just have to call out those who are posting conspiracies that have little to no evidence supporting it. That's my 2¢!

       It's pretty gross how the article glorifies blind belief in one's government.
      </p>
      <p>
       I get it. People who call themselves conspiracy theorists can be dumb/crazy, and so using critical thought and rational consideration is important. You should always be a skeptic (as long as it's general and not for a specific thing).
      </p>
      <p>
       But that's not what this article is advocating. It's sneering at the very concept of questioning the official narrative. It's this sort of blind, fanatical belief that is so dangerous. Case in point, he positively sneers at the idea of chemtrails, and while I agree that the average plane isn't dropping chemicals,
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unethical_human_experimentation_in_the_United_States#1950s">
        THE GOVERNMENT HAS LITERALLY DROPPED CHEMICALS FROM PLANES.
       </a>
       It's been done by the government's own admittance.

       If conspiracies didn't exist then there would be no such thing as whistleblowers. Nobody denies that whistleblowers exist, and I don't don't see how you can have one without the other. In fact u could probably classify conspiracy theories as pre whistleblower and post whistleblower. This is largely a site for pre whistleblower theories :-)

       I agree with her I would never reveal personal info here, you people are dangerous. It's not a debunker it's government agent of course. That is dangerous thinking, and you see it even in this thread. Of course it's not a hipster magazine writing about conspiracies, it's government propaganda. All the media is, because they are saying stuff you don't want to hear.

       It's always dangerous to reveal personal information online!
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, if you want a good primer on how "All the media" might not serve all (or any) of your interests, watch this:
       <a href="https://youtu.be/AnrBQEAM3rE">
        Manufacturing Consent
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       It's dated, but it's fairly easy to take the model and extrapolate it for the internet age, at least when it comes to big outlets, or "small" outlets owned by big outlets. If you don't watch it, then you'll be the one avoiding the stuff you don't want to hear. Enjoy!

       From any perspective someone who specializes their time into a subject that requires a lot of reading could be considered a cult member. Conspiracy theory is interesting because even when your proven correct people still act like the stuff never happens or don't care as most people are only interested in themselves or the image of what they think they project to the outside world aka how they think others see them.  They follow trends and basically allow society to control what they do. Gluten is bad, vegan is good, I should watch keeping up with the kardashians and talk about sports, wear gym clothing all the time so people think I work out, get that masters degree so people think I'm educated, drive a electric car because I care about the future, buy an apple device because it's a status symbol but argue with people about how it's actually better then other devices because it's innovative doesn't matter if the innovations are years behind everyone else.  The point is they are useful in that state willfully expending money and time to project an image so other people see them as they want to be seen and the people who supply them with the tools get rich. Life is easier to accept in a world where you don't look at things that might upset you or worry you or make you question things or ignore things that they feel they can't change.  You can't change some people perspective on some things even with a mountain of evidence baby fed to them hence the saying you can lead a horse to water but you can't make them drink it.

       Now onto the article it's not very informative and simply states the lady who was part of a small conspiracy group decided to read up on the topic she pushed for years when a friend stopped believing in it and came to the conclusion it is all fake. It doesn't go into details of why she thinks it's fake simply that it's fake now because I now believe the evidence against it. Yes this small conspiracy theory makes all conspiracy theory fake now lol. Also people in the conspiracy theory communities are cults because they think like each other lol furthest thing from the truth I have ever heard as a lot of theories have different opinions on who is doing it, why it's being done etc. Vice was bought out years ago and is total crap now

       Exactly!  Some conspiracy theorists are so open minded their brains have fallen out, they will believe anything even if there's no evidence. And lumping us all together is a good tactic for msm. We just have to call out those who are posting conspiracies that have little to no evidence supporting it. That's my 2¢!

       You know, I never thought about it before reading this, but Vice's North Korea coverage is probably responsible for the misinformed and adversarial attitudes held by many 20 and 30 somethings in the US.

       Well it's 5%, via Google:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Murdoch’s 21st Century Fox has procured a 5 per cent stake in Vice Media for $70m (£45m). The deal values the free underground magazine-turned-global entertainment/news brand at $1.4bn.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       This could be Fox doing it, there are so many people at Fox and they're in the news industry.
