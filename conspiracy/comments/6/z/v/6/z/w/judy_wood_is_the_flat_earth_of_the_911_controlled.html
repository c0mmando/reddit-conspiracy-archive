       <strong>
        What’s Your Assessment of the Directed Energy Weapon (DEW) Hypothesis?
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Written by Jonathan Cole, P.E., Richard Gage, AIA, and Gregg Roberts
      </p>
      <p>
       (Editor's Note: We continue to make enhancements to this article as time permits, including supplying additional hyperlinks. The article should be finalized in a few days at the most, but we wanted to get something published sooner rather than later for the benefit of all those who have questions about Judy Wood's new book.)
      </p>
      <p>
       Some have suggested that much of the structural steel of the World Trade Center skyscrapers was turned to dust, or “dustified” – a term used by Judy Wood, the primary proponent of this hypothesis – with some type of directed energy weapon (DEW). Some of the observations cited by Wood include the voluminous dust created during the Twin Towers’ destruction, the “craters” in WTC 5 and 6, “toasted” cars, and small holes in glass windows.
      </p>
      <p>
       While Wood and AE911truth agree that the official story of an “inevitable” collapse by gravity alone is impossible because it conflicts with laws of physics, we completely differ on the mechanism of the destruction. Crucially, once there is proof and consensus that the official story violates elementary laws of physics, our major scientific task has been accomplished. The remaining task is the political challenge of mobilizing support for a legitimate investigation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course the science of the collapse of the Towers and Building 7 can be advanced beyond the mere conclusion that the official story must be false. But it is imperative that anyone serious advancing understanding of the mechanisms of collapse hew closely to scientific methodology. This is crucial to earn the 9/11 movement the public respect it deserves, rather than to cast it into the role of perpetrating "junk science."
      </p>
      <p>
       The scientific method requires us to look at all the available evidence and then assess various explanations for their ability to account for the evidence. At some point, the inferior explanations must be discarded if there is to be continued progress in an investigation, just as in pure science. It is our opinion that the DEW hypothesis is not just weak; it is not supported by the evidence at all. We provide only a general discussion here, referring the reader to references for a thorough understanding.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        A Hypothesis in Search of Facts
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       One of the observations that seems to have motivated Wood to come up with her directed energy weapon hypothesis is that the debris pile at Ground Zero does not seem to be tall enough to contain enough steel to equal what was in the Twin Towers before they came down. She departs from verifiable fact quite early with this claim. FEMA, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, performed the first technical review of what brought down the Twin Towers and WTC 7. Even in its report, FEMA acknowledges (inconveniently for the official story, which cannot account for this fine destruction of the Twin Towers) that roughly 90% of the Twin Towers' mass fell outside their footprints. Indeed, the entire plaza was covered with steel pieces and assemblies. Some of the structural steel was thrown as far away as the Winter Gardens.
      </p>
      <p>
       Given all this, there is no reason to expect a taller debris pile at Ground Zero than the photographs show. Wood's belief that some of the steel must have been turned into dust rests on a completely spuriously interpretation of the visual evidence. Her hypothesis is an attempt to solve a nonexistent problem. As we will show, it can be sustained only by additional poor analysis and leaps of faith, just like the official explanation.

       In other words the collapsing towers violate the laws of physics, QED, and thank you very much. By not investigating the mechanism, one could effectively be obscuring the people responsible, e.g., if thermite alone were used, then it's possible that the perpetrators would not be exactly the same as those who would be in charge of a DEW.
      </p>
      <p>
       Judy Wood (and others) have video and stills of craters, toasted cars and other strange pieces of evidence that are just dismissed here by using quotation marks. There's also clear video of large pieces of the central columns turning to dust – yet they're calling this a "spuriously [sic] interpretation of the visual evidence."
      </p>
      <p>
       90% of the mass fell outside their footprints? I find this one impossible to believe, but hell, if FEMA said it, then it must be true.
      </p>
      <p>
       My question is why spend so much energy sidelining this expert in structural materials and mechanics?

       <em>
        Toasted Cars
       </em>
       - Wood suggests that the tops and other portions of damaged vehicles near Ground Zero may also be attributed to DEW yet doesn’t provide a possible scenario as to how DEW might account for this phenomenon, particularly in view of the fact that the towers reached high above ground while the cars were on the ground.
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        Spire
       </em>
       - upon studying the video of the “spire,” we find that the steel did not “turn to dust” (see for example the next to last segment in
       <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W0-W582fNQ">
        http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W0-W582fNQ
       </a>
       ). The spire clearly simply fell after being attacked by explosive charges, leaving behind, in mid-air, the pulverized concrete that had been resting on, or statically stuck to, the steel. As is well known, air resistance causes dust to fall slower than macroscopic pieces of structural steel.

       The hutchsion effect is the mechanism for the toasted cars. She has explained this and you clearly have not read her full explanation for any of this stuff. It all boils down to a hijacking of the field of quantum mechanics to make you think that something like a DEW is completely impossible.

       Whatever conclusions they're drawing from the evidence of this event, one would be hard-pressed to label it disinformation and/or propaganda. Towards what purpose and for what agenda?

       It's a theory based on observed phenomena that are difficult to explain with a traditional controlled demolition model.

        Spire
       </strong>
       - upon studying the video of the “spire,” we find that the steel did not “turn to dust” (see for example the next to last segment in
       <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W0-W582fNQ">
        http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W0-W582fNQ
       </a>
       ). The spire clearly simply fell after being attacked by explosive charges, leaving behind, in mid-air, the pulverized concrete that had been resting on, or statically stuck to, the steel. As is well known, air resistance causes dust to fall slower than macroscopic pieces of structural steel.

        Toasted Cars

       - Wood suggests that the tops and other portions of damaged vehicles near Ground Zero may also be attributed to DEW yet doesn’t provide a possible scenario as to how DEW might account for this phenomenon, particularly in view of the fact that the towers reached high above ground while the cars were on the ground.

       Spire: It looks like it turns to dust to me. Sorry. Also, you rightly say that charges/explosives can turn concrete to dust, but I don't really think that's true for steel – and all the furniture and other materials that were in the building.

       if the structural steel was "dustified," one would expect to see at least some evidence for partially "dustified" steel members in the debris, yet
