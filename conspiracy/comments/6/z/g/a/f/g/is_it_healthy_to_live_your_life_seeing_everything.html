<p>It is a fair question. I am also interested to know how people can live normie lives when they know that the TV is lying to them, and most/all of their friends/family/coworkers believe the lies.</p>

<p>I would imagine that a fair degree of compartmentalisation is necessary. As in, &#39;switch off critical thinking&#39; from 8.30am-5pm. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t believe that it fully went the way they explain it, but I don&#39;t think it was fully 100% rigged either, I think that&#39;s too convenient of an explanation, of it was all set up, i think hat if it was all rigged, than it was the. It&#39;s perfectly executed plan in all of history, and that&#39;s why I don&#39;t think that, but to me, the government&#39;s explanation is also pretty underwhelming. </p>

<p>To be honest, I still think that no one really knows what happened.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That used to be why I didn&#39;t believe 911 conspiracies, it was too well executed to be a false flag, but now I realize that it probably wasn&#39;t that well executed, its just that the media refused to report on inconsistencies and shut down open debate and investigation that the public might have had by labeling it conspiracy theories that they didn&#39;t have to respond to.

    <div class="md"><p>You asked what showcased Eddie being a moron. Is not the fact that his source for his beliefs is a YT video, rather the content of the video that leads me to believe he is a moron. Consider his response when  asked why he thought Dubay was right and scientist are wrong,&quot; why can you cite the internet but I can&#39;t?&quot; That is a childish point of view. That being said, Yt has a lot of great content (Corbett)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think everything is a conspiracy, I just notice when things don&#39;t add up. For example the ISIS thing, after every western terrorist attack, some politician would claim they were going to go after ISIS. Months and months went by and then I noticed they were still using this line while ISIS was beheading away happily as ever. So it caused me to dig deeper and find out why the west was dragging its feet.
It happened today with the Burma/genocide claim being pasted everywhere showing a very simplistic narrative. I dug deeper and came across a report by the international crisis group explaining that there was a Muslim insurgency group among the Rohingya population being coordinated by an expat group in Saudi. It&#39;s like a missing piece of the jigsaw puzzle that makes you think ok, that would trigger a military backlash. 
So in short, I don&#39;t see everything as a conspiracy, I see things in terms of making sense or not making sense.</p>
