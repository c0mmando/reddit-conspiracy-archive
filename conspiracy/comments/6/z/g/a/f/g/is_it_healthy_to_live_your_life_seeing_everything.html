       Is it healthy to live your life only believing what a small group of wealthy human beings tells you to believe? Is is healthy not to question authorities? Is it healthy to scorn and ridicule other people for having an opinion that didn't come from the mainstream media or the government?

       Some people believe that we're living in an artificial matrix reality, which is supported by several ancient belief systems as well as modern scientism proponents like Elon Musk. If that is the case then the doors are wide open for everything being a conspiracy. For those people that only get their information from mainstream sources and can't comprehend doing research on their own, this is too overwhelming when viewed from any level.

       It is a fair question. I am also interested to know how people can live normie lives when they know that the TV is lying to them, and most/all of their friends/family/coworkers believe the lies.

       I would imagine that a fair degree of compartmentalisation is necessary. As in, 'switch off critical thinking' from 8.30am-5pm.

       What's your point of view with regards to 9/11?  Do you think it went down like the Government says, did they allow it to happen, was it all rigged?  Just curious.

       I don't believe that it fully went the way they explain it, but I don't think it was fully 100% rigged either, I think that's too convenient of an explanation, of it was all set up, i think hat if it was all rigged, than it was the. It's perfectly executed plan in all of history, and that's why I don't think that, but to me, the government's explanation is also pretty underwhelming.
      </p>
      <p>
       To be honest, I still think that no one really knows what happened.

       I think at the least they knew it was going to happen and allowed it.  Just the put options on American Airlines &amp; United alone made me realize TPTB knew it was going to happen.

       That used to be why I didn't believe 911 conspiracies, it was too well executed to be a false flag, but now I realize that it probably wasn't that well executed, its just that the media refused to report on inconsistencies and shut down open debate and investigation that the public might have had by labeling it conspiracy theories that they didn't have to respond to. So basically it wasn't perfect, we just weren't allowed to see the messy details.

       No, seeing everything as a conspiracy is not a healthy state of mind to live in. Of course it's not. But I believe there is a healthy level of skepticism that needs to be applied to any information we digest.

       One podcast comes to mind. I think the subject is flat earth. 
Joe asked Eddie for a source, Eddie said his source was a YouTube video, to which Joe replies with something along the lines of "it's always a YouTube video, what are the chances that one guy(Dubay) has got it right and all the worlds scientist are wrong?"
      </p>
      <p>
       Eddies response "How come you can get sources from the internet but When I try you shut them down?" Forget a dumb child, he's a fucking moron.

       How does that showcase Eddie being a moron? He's a moron for not providing a specific YouTube link? Or just that he's using YouTube in general? Eddie had a good point too. Joe does use YouTube on the show and Eddie was getting ridiculed for trying to do the same. Simply because of the change in subject matter.

       For starters, joe doesn't thing the earth is flat. Eddie believes the earth is flat. That is why I feel he is a moron. And why does he believe the earth is flat? Because some guy said so in a YouTube video.

       That didn't make sense and it seems like you don't have an argument here except to say that you don't buy into the Flat Earth theory and you vehemently believe everyone who does is a complete fucking moron (and should be treated terribly at any opportunity). It also sounds like you don't understand what YouTube is, as it's not a centralized entity for you to criticize but rather a hosting platform for everyday people to post their content to. Credibility of information isn't lost simply because it's been posted to YouTube by someone.

       You asked what showcased Eddie being a moron. Is not the fact that his source for his beliefs is a YT video, rather the content of the video that leads me to believe he is a moron. Consider his response when  asked why he thought Dubay was right and scientist are wrong," why can you cite the internet but I can't?" That is a childish point of view. That being said, Yt has a lot of great content (Corbett)

      <p>
       What!? That's not his point of view. He's defending himself against what Joe was saying/doing, which was attacking Eddie's argument simply because some of the information was on YouTube. And again, for you to say "Yt has a lot of great content (Corbett)" tells me that you don't really understand. YouTube is a public video hosting platform, not a centralized entity like Netflix producing and controlling its own content. It makes 0 sense to critique YT as a whole in this case as a means of argument.

       The only source of physical health would be avoiding certain 'nutrition' additives. Maybe even avoiding vaccinations.

       I don't think everything is a conspiracy, I just notice when things don't add up. For example the ISIS thing, after every western terrorist attack, some politician would claim they were going to go after ISIS. Months and months went by and then I noticed they were still using this line while ISIS was beheading away happily as ever. So it caused me to dig deeper and find out why the west was dragging its feet.
It happened today with the Burma/genocide claim being pasted everywhere showing a very simplistic narrative. I dug deeper and came across a report by the international crisis group explaining that there was a Muslim insurgency group among the Rohingya population being coordinated by an expat group in Saudi. It's like a missing piece of the jigsaw puzzle that makes you think ok, that would trigger a military backlash. 
So in short, I don't see everything as a conspiracy, I see things in terms of making sense or not making sense.

       For starters, joe doesn't thing the earth is flat. Eddie believes the earth is flat. That is why I feel he is a moron. And why does he believe the earth is flat? Because some guy said so in a YouTube video.

        Consider his response when asked why he thought Dubay was right and scientist are wrong," why can you cite the internet but I can't?" That is a childish point of view.

       What!? That's not his point of view. He's defending himself against what Joe was saying/doing, which was attacking Eddie's argument simply because some of the information was on YouTube. And again, for you to say "Yt has a lot of great content (Corbett)" tells me that you don't really understand. YouTube is a public video hosting platform, not a centralized entity like Netflix producing and controlling its own content. It makes 0 sense to critique YT as a whole in this case as a means of argument.
