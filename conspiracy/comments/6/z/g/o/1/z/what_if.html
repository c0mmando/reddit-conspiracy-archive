        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Just throwing this out there. So in magik a spell is cast. the reason the spell works is because of the spell casters INTENT or FOCUS on the spell. This is why individuals can create thier own spells that do the same thing. the spell ritual isnt as important as the intended effect.</p>

<p>So we know about Bohemian Grove, etc. we hear about the children disappearing and pedogate, we hear about govt involvememt in media and entertainment, etc.</p>

<p>So what if TPTB are a satanic cult doing rituals and casting spells through the media? People pull up weird stuff from movies that seem to predict future events (back to the future/911 for example) what if thise werent clues as to what would happen but the actual spell to make it happen? what if by watching the movie we are subconciously giving power to that spell. because our intentions are not what the spellcaster intends the script is written in a way to get you to match the intentions. even if its just ine scene. im not saying this is exactly going on but if they are into the occult and doing sacrifices, maybe we should be discussing why they do this and maybe have some magik practitioners offer some insight. i just want to see if there are other avenues we havent explored that xan better explain all this stuff going on.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>exactly! i have this idea, since i was a little kid, that LITERALLY anything you can think of can exist.  maybe if you thought of a unicorn and said, see it doesnt exist, but what if i genetically modified a horse to grow a horn on its head? does that not count? this line of thinking, i feel, is ine that should be explored by persons more intellectually capable than myself.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If that genetically modified horse had an Alicorn which when touched, heals what it touches, then perhaps.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve studied unicorn mythology and it seems perhaps the original intention of the image, was to describe either a Rhino, or another, single horned, actually existent creature.</p>

<p>The image of the unicorn transformed into a magical creature much later, and for a long time represented Jesus Christ (or the bloodline of). </p>

<p>For more information, see &quot;The Hunt of the Unicorn&quot;, which refers to several tapstries currently hung in the Rockefeller Museum in NY.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is where i am in my journey and i think your dead on. I think we create our own personal realities with physical/non physical actions and thoughts and then the collective reality (earth) is created by the collective. Almost like a remote, Which every group has the strongest grip on the remote gets their reality more than the others. </p>

<p>In regards to Bohemian Grove and child sacrifice, everything works on a equal and opposite scale. Yin and yang. What it looks like these people are doing is destroying life,creating fear/pain as a collective and intending for the goals to happen with the negative energy. If we were to do the equal/opposite. It would be creating life/growing plants/caring for people/animals and creating positive emotions. I think monsters inc. was a good lesser magik film explaining this idea.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>yes, thank you for expanding on this.  i too think to combat this the answer is peace and spread live.  for one thing it is harder to come between neighbors if we are kind to each other and care for each other.  someone attempting to manipulate us would stick out more in a society based around peace and love.  i think thats why jfk, mlk jr, bob marley, john lennon and more have been killed.  they were pushing the one and only answer to all of our problems, togetherness..</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m by no means a all-knowing sort and don&#39;t have a depository of info to point you to but I just have a gut feeling that whoever has been running the show (and I do mean show) behind the scenes has always been from the same blood line dating far back to egypt and beyond. Therefor WAY before Satan. </p>

<p>For instance the Order of the Temple of Solomon. The temple predates the bible  and the Templar predates the Freemason. I&#39;m just saying that Oz has always been behind the curtain before the Jews wrote the bible.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>how about not just throwing some piece of info aside just because you believe it to be nonsense.  there is plenty of evidence to support that people in positions if power are in secret cults doing rituals and the like.  it doesnt have to be real but it is certainly going on.  stop trying to waste my time with your personal opinion and state what you think is going on.  your just going to ignore all the stuff to do with people who run the country and the fact that they practice this? your cool with that because you think its not real? your either  in here to distract me from actually continuing the discussion or you dont give a crap about it either way you can show yourself out.</p>
