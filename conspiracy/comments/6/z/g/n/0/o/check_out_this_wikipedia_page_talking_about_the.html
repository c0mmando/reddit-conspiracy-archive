<p>&quot;The Pythagorean concept of a spherical Earth offers a simple surface that is mathematically easy to deal with. Many astronomical and navigational computations use it as a surface representing the Earth. While the sphere is a close approximation of the true figure of the Earth and satisfactory for many purposes, to the geodesists interested in the measurement of long distances on the scale of continents and oceans, a more exact figure is necessary.&quot;</p>

<p>Look at the references at the bottom, google scholar should take you to the papers with additional sourcing. </p>

<p>Essentially the real accurate measurements use saltellites to do both visual, laser and gravitational potentials to get a very clear idea of how the Earth is shaped. There should also be info in there combining cartography techniques with gravitational measurements. </p>

<p>Basically ask a cartographer or post in there sub for more info on how they do measurements. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thats one way to look at it because you chose one sentence out of context to refute the entire idea. </p>

<p>Another sentence you skimmed over</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We estimate, for example, that the root mean square errors of the geoid heights deduced from models by Lerch et al. and Gaposchkin are about 3 m and that maximum errors may exceed 10 m in some places.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They arent saying &quot;We have no idea what the shape of the Earth is&quot; they are saying that the differences between the techniques (Which they also briefly explained why differing techniques produce slightly different results) used to measure can be off by up to 10 m in certain places. </p>

<p>Now remember the circumference of the Earth is about 24,901 miles and a difference of 10 m is 2.5099393598650656600136540701177e-5% difference. </p>

<p>So pretty good considering. But yes you are correct those scientists did say that we can only know the shape of the Earth to an error margin of about 10 meters.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Geodetics proves the Earth is flat when we are on it. Which is why they use geodetic frames. It may very well be round from space, but on Earth it&#39;s flat.</p>

<p>This really shouldn&#39;t be controversial when quantum physics is turning waves into particles by observation.</p>

<p>What&#39;s interesting is that there&#39;s a very simple experiment which could be done to prove the geodesy (the larger globe shape) yet, except for an account from <a href="http://www.mathpages.com/rr/s8-06/8-06.htm">Gauss as an experiment in 1855 while topographically and geodetically mapping Germany</a></p>

<p>If this same experiment were performed today it would be a nail in the flat earth coffin. Similar experiments are conducted very often where they measure the height of mountains, so why not add in measurement of the angular deviation from 2 other mountain tops, since they are there anyway?</p>

<p>It&#39;s bizarre there is no standard for this experiment, or that it has never been done.</p>

<p>The whole point of the spherical triangle measurement is it&#39;s nearly impossible to interpret wrong or to be used in a different model of Earth.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a legitimate experiment. One that they <em>do</em> to find other measurements (heights of mountains), there&#39;s no reason for it not to be done. If the world is geodetic like the entire industry that is Geodesy and Geodetic surveys suggests, it also makes Erastothenes measurements irrelevant.</p>

<p>Here is the easiest way to conceptualize how and why angles would differ on a globe vs a flat plane. </p>

<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/oFD5ley.gifv">http://i.imgur.com/oFD5ley.gifv</a></p>

<p>You cant ever have 3 right angles intersecting on a piece of paper, try it out. </p>

<p>This example is obviously an exaggeration but should demonstrate that we will see differences in those measurements. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Did you read any of the previous posts. The triangular deviation is exactly what is determined in the geodetic 3-mountain test. But its a direct observation. Using light is indirect from the sun is indirect.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Using light from the sun is indirect, plus you need to cover hundreds of kilometres for it to work [which would require a map or model to calculate which would be useless].</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again Im not following. We can create two different hypothesis regarding the 3 mountain experiment as you put it. </p>

<p>If we assume the Earth is flat, the distance of the sun doesnt really matter at least for this. </p>

<p>If we believe the Earth is flat then we take our measurements of the 3 mountains we should expect to see a certain measurement, we agree that 3 points on a plane will produce a different result than on a globe, right? </p>

<p>Then we assume the Earth is a globe and when we take our 3 measurements we should expect to see a certain measurement, right?</p>

<p>So when this test is performed they are mutually exclusive, we will not see the correct measurements for a plane, we will see them for a globe. </p>

<p>Even over hundreds of km with a decent error margin we will see one or the other, not evidence for both. </p>

<p>if more its spheroid, if it hasn&#39;t changed its flat.</p>

<p>And yet the experiment doesn&#39;t exist. You claim something without any proof or evidence of the claim. <em>If</em> its flat there&#39;d be no deviation in the angle. <em>If</em> its convex-sphere, a positive angular deviation. <em>If</em> it&#39;s concave-sphere, a negative deviation.</p>

<p><strong>The experiment has never been performed</strong>, except for the ~1850s account of Gauss which was in numerous textbooks, but it has been declared &quot;myth&quot; by &quot;scientists&quot; who write papers proving a negative (impossible). They could have simply repeated the experiment but chose to &quot;study&quot; it not existing instead.</p>
