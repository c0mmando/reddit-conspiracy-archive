Right now 2/2 civil engineers who are PEs (Professional Engineers) in my office both know that the main 9/11 story is bullshit but you certainly won&#39;t catch them mouthing off about it to clients or affiliates.

<p>This one for example says there isn&#39;t a link between use of LSD, Mushroom or mescaline and mental health problems or suicide.</p>

<p><a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0269881114568039">http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0269881114568039</a></p>

More and more people are coming to learn about the event because they&#39;re too young to remember. While there&#39;s plenty of shady things that actually happened that day, I read a lot of pretty blatant nonesense here that would be disproven by anyone&#39;s first-hand experience. If you don&#39;t trust the news, talk to your teachers. If you don&#39;t trust your teachers, talk to your parents. Keep an open mind, but not so open your brains fall out. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I partially disagree. It is a real disorder and those meds are very helpful at times. That said I didn&#39;t start taking them till I was an adult. I was lucky enough to go to small and private schools as a kid, where teachers catered to my unique needs. I was able to thrive in such an adaptive learning environment. I did well in school and eventually went to college and grad school. I agree that children shouldn&#39;t be medicated as much, it is simply a crutch to help them fit into a non-ADHD world. IMHO nothing is wrong with people who have ADHD, they simply think and function in ways that most other people don&#39;t so they have a hard time fitting into the molds that most people do. They tend to be more focused on the big picture and capable of making connections between various concepts that normal people would miss. But their attention to detail is sometimes lacking as a result and they aren&#39;t always able to articulate their big picture ideas clearly because they rush into it and sometimes forget that what is obvious to them won&#39;t be obvious to others. Some psychiatrists describe their thought process as multi-threaded, to give an analogy to computers. They appear distractible because they are thinking about much more than most people are at any given moment. It&#39;s more of a social incompatibility than a disorder in this sense. I think alternative schedules and more loosely structured curriculum would be more appropriate than medication. But in schools with limited resources, medication might be the only way these kids succeed because it will allow them to narrow their thought process and act more like everyone else. Lastly, the testing is very rigorous and complex. Suffice it to say that it wouldn&#39;t be easy, especially as a kid, to fake having the disorder and pass medical scrutiny. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This. </p>

<p>I was diagnosed with ADHD/ADD when I was in the third grade and immediately prescribed adderall.  Even as I&#39;ve aged, I maintain an intense struggle to tune in and pay attention to things as detrimental as my driving or simple shit like a conversation with [person]. Despite taking 50 mg of adderall (which, don&#39;t get me wrong, does help a TON) daily, I often times find myself failing a test at the end of the week, awaked by the realization that I had not paid attention to fucking squat all week. </p>

<p>Extremely. Frustrating.</p>

<p>Like dude if it&#39;s this bad <em>with</em> medication, imagine how gone I am without. I&#39;m by absolutely no means a professional lmao but I don&#39;t think this is normal or healthy and for me, medz are necessary to at LEAST secure a decent school career.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Uh no.  It&#39;s a condition that corresponds with two main genes, one that affects the level of dopamine transport protein (DAT) in the synaptic cleft of your neurons and another that affects dopamine synthesis.</p>

<p>Deficiencies in either or both of these directly affect the amount of dopamine in the synaptic cleft, and if you don&#39;t have enough of that neurotransmitter certain neural pathways related to reward will not fire.</p>

<p>If you don&#39;t feel reward for your actions, you have no motivation to do them.  The only things that you are physically motivated to do are impulsive, reckless, or instantly gratifying activities because all of those increase dopamine levels.  You also have limited executive function and perception  of time (planning is not rewarding, and you only think about time in terms of planning future actions)</p>

<p>While I don&#39;t necessarily agree with perscribing stimulants to children in most cases, there is compelling literature to suggest that by taking stimulants you develop previously underutilized neural pathways.   This is most likely more beneficial to children who have increased neuroplasticity.</p>

<p>Also no one gets perscribed meth.  Lol.</p>

<p>If you just make claims contrary to what you are told in every instance you&#39;re just as bad as the people who are telling you what to believe.</p>

<p>Do your research.  You&#39;re the reason the conspiracy theorist label works.</p>

<p>Was trying to allude to the idea that abductions being not for pedophilia, but for a secret society thats being programmed and indoctrinated. I suck at conspiracy, I guess.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, and take it a step further. Like.. I believed &#39;parts&#39; of pizzagate and the pedo/satanic shit was just bs and invalidated all of it initially.. Look at it again and think.. what if parts are true and the other are bs just there TO invalidate...</p>

<p>Ok.. what the fucking hell do they want kids for???</p>

<p>You can tie that part to other conspiracy theories already out there.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Google.com/scholar will be your best bet.</p>

<p>I&#39;m finding some interesting information.</p>

<p>This one for example says there isn&#39;t a link between use of LSD, Mushroom or mescaline and mental health problems or suicide.</p>

<p><a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0269881114568039">http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0269881114568039</a></p>

<p>It is from 2015 so this is newer information available than I am was familiar with.</p>

<p>But this is not specifically about use by teenagers. </p>

<p>Best of luck to you. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Salvia is one of the last psychedelics i&#39;d recommend to someone who has never tripped. It&#39;s a very intense experience</p>

<p>a very light dose of lsd or mushrooms would be my first recommendations. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.nature.com/news/no-link-found-between-psychedelics-and-psychosis-1.16968">https://www.nature.com/news/no-link-found-between-psychedelics-and-psychosis-1.16968</a></p>

<p>There&#39;s plenty of other research available on psychedelic drugs in general. The rule of thumb is that if you don&#39;t have a history of severe mental illness in your family, you&#39;ll be fine tripping</p>

<p>Erowid.org is generally a good resource as well. And of course, r/drugs</p>
