       It's odd to me that these redditors, who are likely young and male and childless, are so overly obsessed with vaccines. If you ask any of these people circlejerking, I guarantee you they would not be able to tell you how many vaccines are in the CDC schedule compared what they were given.
      </p>
      <p>
       They would not be able to tell you about how vaccine immunity only lasts several years, and that it's likely that they no longer have titers for the diseases they fear so much. They would not want to hear that they could be vectors for disease right now because they are not any longer vaccinated.
      </p>
      <p>
       They would not be able to tell you about the multiple repeated doses at birth, 2 months, 4 months, 6 months, etc. They wouldn't be able to tell you about how a tiny baby will get 8 vaccines in one visit.
      </p>
      <p>
       They would not be able to tell you that there are human diploid cells in many vaccines. It was cells come from aborted fetuses, and are implicated in autoimmune disorders. The vegan redditors would not be able to tell you that there is fetal bovine serum in some, which they get by stabbing a fetal calf in the heart. They would not be able to tell you that there are cocker spaniel tumor cells in the flu shot.
      </p>
      <p>
       They would not be able to tell you about the aluminum in it no, we're what it's for, or why it's in there. They would not be able to tell you about the studies showing 5 times the infant mortality when given the DPT shot. They would not be able to tell you about the studies that show that if you get the flu shot you're more likely to get secondary infections.
      </p>
      <p>
       They would not be able to tell you about how many vaccines cause a Th2 dominance in your immune system, or the implications of that.
      </p>
      <p>
       They would not be able to tell you that the pertussis vaccine, when you were exposed to wild illness, can cause you to become an asymptomatic carrier, where you're carrying the bacteria in your throat and unknowingly spreading it to others.
      </p>
      <p>
       They don't know about any of that stuff. All they know is what the propaganda told them and they will circle-jerk and bring that stupid shower thought to the front page. I just find their obsession odd, given their demographics. I also find it crazy how I was once one of those people. I really feel like somebody instigates these types of threads. Rant over.

       You have raised many seemingly good points (seemingly because I have no empirically based idea).

       This is one of those discussions that is nearly impossible to have here (seems to be in the no fly zone along with a handful of other radar topics)

       That being said, since you seem to have given much thought to the general subject, what do you think the reason is for the prevalence of administration?

       The national vaccine injury compensation program. Aka "vaccine court". Pays out billions to children found to be vaccine-injured. Not with the manufacturer's money, but with taxes. Protects the manufacturer from all liability. As a citizen, you are literally not allowed to sue a vaccine manufacturer.

       Though, it has been shown that vaccines had seem to favor doing damage to minorities, like blacks specifically.  The damage done is in the form of a huge increase in autism rates.

       about profits, and I liken the corporate immunity to Germany and how it is illegal to deny the holocaust.  If its true, you don't need to protect it through law.  It will be clear as day.  Instead, they make people fear through retribution from the state.  That is fucked and just the same as a vaccine court.

       Yes, that is way outside my empirical purview- I could read profit statements and listen to earnings calls, but the injury is for those in a better position to convey.   My sister was recently married and would like more real information before they get caught in that trap.

       And a lot of people think big pharma is purposely maiming children. I personally disagree. I think most CDC researchers, doctors, etc really do think they're doing good. They just can't accept the fact that something is wrong with all these injections. They're in too deep and admitting the error of their ways would bring down the whole system.

       Yep! The Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS). About 3000-4500 severe vaccine reactions are reported to the CDC every year (Sharockman, 2015), and thus far in 2015 about 140 Million dollars has been paid out for vaccine injuries (Murphy, 2017).In 1986 Congress gave the drug companies immunity against all lawsuits from vaccine related injuries, and therefore it cannot be proven in federal court that vaccines cause injuries, only in vaccine court. I feel that is what is most interesting is not the exemption from liability that vaccine manufacturers were able to gain, but the fact that physicians actually get compensated for vaccinating a certain number of children. Within the BCBS on page 15 it talks about paying out 400$ for every member vaccinated without an injury
       <a href="http://www.whale.to/c/2016-BCN-BCBSM-Incentive-Program-Booklet.pdf">
        http://www.whale.to/c/2016-BCN-BCBSM-Incentive-Program-Booklet.pdf
       </a>
       and for every 100 children fully vaccinated under the age of two the physician gets a 40,000$ bonus (Elizabeth, 2017).
      </p>

       I gave up trying to reason with people about vaxxing a loooooong time ago. Just this past week I read a stupid post with a bunch of woman going on about how unvaxxed kids should not be allowed to see the same ped as vaxxed kids or how they aren't allowed in the same schools or how the parents are obviously religious retards. It made me kind of sick.

       Nice article, hadn't heard of that.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        In 2002, Hannah's parents filed an autism claim in federal vaccine court. Five years later, the government settled the case before trial and had it sealed. It's taken more than two years for both sides to agree on how much Hannah will be compensated for her injuries.
       </p>
       <p>
        In acknowledging Hannah's injuries, the government said vaccines aggravated an unknown mitochondrial disorder Hannah had which didn't "cause" her autism, but "resulted" in it. It's unknown how many other children have similar undiagnosed mitochondrial disorder.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I wonder if there is any evidence of this so called mitochondrial disorder, or if it's just a way to make sure they stay off the hook.

       he has a valid point. invariably the anti-vax argument goes back to conspiracy, claiming any compelling piece of evidence we provide is simply manufactured to support the conspiracy.

       these studies aren't legit, 'big pharma' paid them to say that!

       it's to your benefit and completely impossible to disprove.

       anyway, i think the whole argument is laughable. i don't think 'infiltration' or 'propaganda' are necessary when an overwhelming majority of parents factually believe in vaccinating their kids, reflected in the vaccination rates. Don't believe vaccination rate statistics? Are those infiltrated as well? Look at how many kids are in public schools.
      </p>
      <p>
       As a result, a parenting sub reddit would, even without the biases of what type of parent reddits, be expected to largely accept vaccination theory. Wouldn't you agree?

       Regarding your first point, did you even watch the congressman Posey video I gave you?
       <strong>
        The CDC is being accused of fraud, by its own scientists.

       That's not a conspiracy, that's a fact.

       My point about the parenting sub in particular is that it's not like other parenting forums on the internet. Elsewhere on the internet people are skeptical and will discuss vaccines freely. Reddit is just different in that regard.

       It's a fact they're being
       <strong>
        accused
       </strong>
       ? Well, that means fuck-all, doesn't it? Show me one public institution as big as the CDC that isn't being accused of something or other, probably on a daily basis. While we're playing ad hominem and who's being accused of what (even though the CDC isn't by any means in control of what research is released nor is it the only institution performing vaccine research) I took a look at Mr. Posey. Aside from joining the rest of idiot America on the hunt for Obama's birth certificate (classic), he also believes thimerosal causes autism. That's really, really surprising to me!
      </p>
      <p>
       I'll also point out (boy, i love this) that the CDC 'whistleblower', Dr. William Thompson, released a statement shortly after news broke of his critical omission, concluding with "I want to be absolutely clear that I believe vaccines have saved and continue to save countless lives. I would never suggest that any parent avoid vaccinating children of any race. Vaccines prevent serious diseases, and the risks associated with their administration are vastly outweighed by their individual and societal benefits." I only bring this up because while you all point to him as a (the only?) beacon of truth in this world of corruption and conspiracy that is science, I'm pretty sure you'd jump off a cliff before agreeing to that statement.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regarding "parenting forums on the internet": of course there are pockets of people elsewhere on the internet that feel differently about vaccines. That's fine, that's their right, but it doesn't make them
       <strong>
        right
       </strong>
       . Just because some people on homeopathic/naturopathic forums are more afraid of vaccines than r/parenting doesn't mean they're any more qualified to talk about it. I'd like to add I think skepticism is critical; I think it'd be idiotic/criminal not to be looking into the safety of vaccines as a society. You might think I'm just pro-vax but truth be told, I don't care anywhere near as much about peoples' kids nearly as i do science. And in science, we look at data. And, as has been discussed over and over again (and affirmed by our fearless whistleblower!), while they are not a perfect technology,
       <strong>
        vaccines do vastly more good than harm, on an individual and societal level
       </strong>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, u/rockran's original point was that r/parenting could be the way that it is with little to no 'influence'. i agree, because nearly every parent out there vaccinates and that could be represented there. are there 'influencers' on the sub? it's possible. fortunately, i think few people go on reddit to find out what to do with their kids and instead listen to doctors and scientists. you know, people who know what the fuck they're talking about. because at the end of the day, for your conspiracy to work, you'd need tens of thousands of the world's intellectual .1% to be 'in on it' or just downright ignorant. and a small group of people who've never taken basic chemistry to have outsmarted them. hmm.

       In phase I, it was observed that there was a significantly increased risk ratio for the incidence of ASD reported following the Thimerosal-containing DTaP vaccine in comparison to the Thimerosal-free DTaP vaccine. In phase II, it was observed that cases diagnosed with an ASD were significantly more likely than controls to receive increased organic-Hg from Thimerosal-containing hepatitis B vaccine administered within the first, second, and sixth month of life.

       The increase in exposure to Al adjuvants significantly correlates with the increase in ASD prevalence in the United States observed over the last two decades; and a significant correlation exists between the amounts of Al administered to preschool children and the current prevalence of ASD in seven Western countries, particularly at 3-4 months of age. The application of the Hill's criteria to these data indicates that the correlation between Al in vaccines and ASD may be causal.

       Between 12 and 24 mo of age, these previously normally developing children suffered mercury toxic encephalopathies that manifested with clinical symptoms consistent with regressive ASDs. Evidence for mercury intoxication should be considered in the differential diagnosis as contributing to some regressive ASDs.

       Therefore, autism is the result of genetic defects and/or inflammation of the brain. The inflammation could be caused by a defective placenta, immature blood-brain barrier, the immune response of the mother to infection while pregnant, a premature birth, encephalitis in the child after birth, or a toxic environment.

       Aw how truly disappointing that is. Just when I was finally getting a feeling of respect for our discussions too. I spent all that time reading and typing out my response and you conveniently ignored most of my post and dropped a copy+paste of a bunch of crap papers that have been refuted by myself and others time and time again. Honestly, it feels a lot like exasperation, I’ll take it as a compliment!

       I should also note most of these papers are published in “pay-to-publish” (garbage journals), many have conflicts of interest, and some have been retracted. Brilliant.

       Also, I did some more digging to convince myself whether or not a vaccinated vs. unvaccinated study was feasible and found (this)[

       Now about the thimerosol...come on now, you don't really believe that it's all gone do you? It's no longer used as a preservative in the single dose vials, but it's still used in the production of the dtap. So it's present, just not as much.

       This is not necessarily always true. As the link you posted below describes, things can be purified out depending on what step they're used in. They can also be used in tiny amounts so that after the reaction is over, there's essentially none left. Just want to be clear on that.

       The cells the viruses are grown on are also supposed to be filtered out, but it doesn't always happen unfortunately. That's why some batches can be more dangerous than others, ie "hot lots". (Luckily for the manufacturers, they spread the lots out now rather than send one batch to one area. Because that would be too obvious when the kids in one area all have problems.)

       Is there a test to measure current titers? That would be SUPER interesting data. Pro-forced-vax and low on titers? Go get your shots, hon!

       Yep! The Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS). About 3000-4500 severe vaccine reactions are reported to the CDC every year (Sharockman, 2015), and thus far in 2015 about 140 Million dollars has been paid out for vaccine injuries (Murphy, 2017).In 1986 Congress gave the drug companies immunity against all lawsuits from vaccine related injuries, and therefore it cannot be proven in federal court that vaccines cause injuries, only in vaccine court. I feel that is what is most interesting is not the exemption from liability that vaccine manufacturers were able to gain, but the fact that physicians actually get compensated for vaccinating a certain number of children. Within the BCBS on page 15 it talks about paying out 400$ for every member vaccinated without an injury

       and for every 100 children fully vaccinated under the age of two the physician gets a 40,000$ bonus (Elizabeth, 2017).

       This is not necessarily always true. As the link you posted below describes, things can be purified out depending on what step they're used in. They can also be used in tiny amounts so that after the reaction is over, there's essentially none left. Just want to be clear on that.

       You are criticizing the extraordinarily minute presence of a substance that has been repeatedly &amp; empirically determined to be harmless at much higher concentrations.
