<blockquote>
<p>During the Vietnam War the bodies &amp; caskets of dead soldiers often contained Heroin being smuggled into the United States on military aircraft. Plastic-wrapped drugs were shipped into the USA in the bottom of caskets, in body bags, and even in body cavities. Upon arrival at Air Force bases the drugs would be removed. One heartless guy who worked in this grisly venture even remarked &quot;Who the hell is gonna look in a dead soldier&#39;s coffin?&quot; Is it happening again ? Two well seasoned veterans who had first hand knowledge of the previous operationthinks it&#39;s very possible after all Afghanistan now produces over 90% of the worlds Heroin.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>...&quot;dailykos&quot;...  Hell, son, I was there, &#39;70-71. A gram of 95-98% heroin in a gram vial was $5-$15 in MPC script. Heroin came in different grades, mainly one for smoking, one for snorting. Shit was everywhere. I&#39;ve seen reports of 10-20% of Gi&#39;s addicted; maybe 30% occasional users. Yeah, it was demoralizing to see guys nodding out on guard duty every night. Was it a conspiracy? I don&#39;t know. Guys I talked to all bought their smack from ARVN soldiers, usually an officer. The South Viet army was so corrupt, so sure of losing the war by 1970, I can see them dealing with Air America trading guns for heroin. CIA, destroying lives to prop up tin pan dictators at the expense of Americans since forever.    </p>

<p>When you look at the map, you can see how Vietnam was right next door to the triangle. It also makes a lot more sense why operations eventually spread into Laos and Cambodia (both nations within the triangle itself).</p>

<p>afghanistan is more about 1tn usd worth of mineral resources, and simply about controlling the territory, for strategic, oil pipes, etc reasons and finally, yes, poppies.  they - the us military - even reimburse the farmers when they loose their crops for whatever reason.</p>
