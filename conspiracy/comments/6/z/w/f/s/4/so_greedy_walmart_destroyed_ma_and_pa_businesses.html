       To top it all off, one look out the window and anyone can see endless nationwide corporations planted all over the place taking up valuable real estate where Ma and Pa shops used to be.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some examples are McDonald's, Burger King, Best Buy, Taco Bell, Verizon, etc..
      </p>
      <p>
       What a fucking joke. They took all of the business from the 99% and gave it to the 1%. Then they wonder why the top 20 richest people have more wealth than half of the world's population. The people who don't need the money are scrambling to take over all the Ma and Pa businesses without a care in the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then dumb asses like Bush say that these Big Businesses need more money so they can hire the Ma and Pa shop employees who are now broke and need a job. So he, and others, lower taxes on these filthy rich claiming the trickle down effect will solve all of our problems while knowing damn well that it will increase the income gap.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then they (i.e. Obama) spend our tax dollars on shit like funding ISIS and paying Rothschild for so graciously printing our money and lending it to us at high interest rates. Hell, we are barely covering the interest rate on Rothschilds Federal Reserve bills. All those tax dollars are going to the people who don't even need it like Rothschild and billionaire arms manufacturers.
      </p>
      <p>
       These same people consider themselves to be above the law and so they do every vile thing imaginable (pedophelia, cannabalism, human sacrifices, organ harvesting, prostitution, etc..).
      </p>
      <p>
       When we complain, they tell us to write our congressmen and everything will be OK knowing damn well the Congressmen don't give a shit about our letters. They probabaly don't even read them personally.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most of the US government is guilty of treason and sabatoge.

       I think step 1 should be ending taxes. We, the people, would end them so that more money floats in the economy. I don't like funding terrorists or cops who steal any loose cash they find on citizens.
      </p>
      <p>
       2nd, we should all try our best to shop and Ma and Pa shops. The problem is these corporations are enourmous and have hoards of money but by giving our money to Ma and Pa shops, we are keeping our money in the general 99% pool who will end up spending it instead of hoarding it like the corporations do.

       Probably, but most are not actually going to do that. Not any more likely than any random celebrity is to leave the country if their candidate doesn't get elected. The real truth is that the reason they stay here is because they want to be here. If they didn't really really want to live in the USA, goodness knows they could build a much more comfortable life in another country.

       We, the people, simply stop paying. We can forgive our own debts in the same exact way. We, the people, outrank the government. If we don't like something, we can just stop doing it. There is no need to wait for corrupt gov officials to change laws because they never will so we simply just do it.

       This is how it starts. We start on subs and expand our way out. It's very similar to how a large amount of people got respilled. We start here and expand. Before you know it, people will stop paying taxes like popcorn Popping in a microwave. Eventually all the popcorn will pop. We act as the heat in the microwave.

       If you want to tell people to stop paying taxes, who will fund the prisons that you will be inevitably sent to? We don't have to take the offensive against the government because we will never win that way. There are countries (eg. Sweden,Denmark) where over 50% of their income is taxed, but their country is among the happiest. The problem isn't the government taxing us, it's necessary for societal progress in the forms of welfare, education, infrastructure, etc. The problem is when the government uses the tax money for the wrong reasons.

       I'll have to use batman as an example here but batman, a character that defies all odds, always says "There is always a way".  This is optimist. There is always a way is a true statement.
      </p>
      <p>
       Pessimists usually think of a complex problem and when they are unable to resolve it quickly, they simply give up deeming it impossible. What they don't realize is that there is a way to solve the problem but they simply don't know the solution yet. Instead of working towards a solution, they simply give up and deem the problem to be unsolvable.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was trained to be an optimist in the military like many others. It takes trial and error to become an optimist. Belief is the most important step. Pessimists often give up before even trying because they simply dont belive things are possible.

       do you realize how retarded that sounds... taxes are what keeps are government running, without a government it would be anarchy. I agree that taxes could be lower and government is not as efficient as it could be, however not paying taxes is the dumbest thing I've heard in awhile, no wonder this sub gets a bad rep.

       ending the federal reserve would mean the collapse of our economy, no way around that. If you just taxed billionaires you wouldn't have enough money to sustain the economy, both are not viable solutions. Do yourself a favor and learn basic economics before proposing solutions to systems which are clearly beyond your comprehension.

       No, that would be step 2. Step 1 is to stop giving our money to these corporations. Why buy movies? Why subscribe to Netflix? Why drink alcohol regularly - or, if one must drink, why not learn how to make your own? Why purchase brand name clothes?
      </p>
      <p>
       One of the reasons there is practically no real, skeptical, independent, research-based media out there is because there is no money in it. 'Conspiracy' people claim to believe in truth and goodness, wbut when it comes to the crunch, they spend their money like regular normies.

       That is a fair point, but I feel like the anger is pointed in the wrong place. There will always be dicks who try take advantage of others, it's the governments role to prevent this. The angry should be directed at the government. Walmart is just a symptom of a much worse problem.

       Name a business that doesn't benefit in some way from the state. Social formations are complexities of relations, of interlinked parts, and there's nothing non-capitalist about it - you simply need to be a bit more realist about what capitalism is.

I also don't deny we have the capacity for self destruction, and perhaps it will occur if we continue to indulge our basest desires, but if we decide instead to focus on our higher inclinations, for the benefit of all living beings, life's systems could easily thrive!  Probably to a degree that we currently cannot even imagine.  At times it seems we are just on the cusp taking this incredible step forward, perhaps it is closer than you think.

       So glad this is the top comment. You wanna know who killed the mom n pop shop, THE CONSUMERS. People made a choice to stop shopping at local businesses and instead opted for big box and online mega stores. Fuck the corporations but also, fuck the people who made them that big to begin with.

       Also, fuck the mom and pop stores who made zero effort to change when they saw it coming. A lot of the time, a lot of these stores weren't really paying that much more for their products, they just chose to drive the price up to 2-3x Wal-Mart retail, then cried when they lost customers, even though they could have still made money on slightly above Wal-Mart margin.

       Where I live in Canada if a small business can't make $250,000-$500,000 per year they deem it not worth the effort. I have seen numerous small businesses go under by refusing to be competitive and gouging with ridiculous costs. I recently renovated a kitchen using Ikea for $7500 The closest small business was $12,000. Now it took a little longer and I had to do the work but the quality of Ikeas product was better. If I wanted equal quality the quotes where closer to $20,000 which is ridiculous for a small kitchen.

       You CAN buy IKEA cabinets and have them installed. It's around 4k for a medium sized kitchen for install. So 11.5k to buy them and have them installed. 20k doesn't matter when you have the same IKEA cabinets installed for nearly half that.

       No  I was not willing to pay $10-15,000 profit to a guy who orders cheap product from a giant company for cheap because he has a contractors license and then spend 6-8 hours screwing cabinets to a wall. If he was doing heart surgery or actually building the cabinets by hand that's another thing. Comprehension issues?

       Actually I DO now what I'm talking about because I've done 3 kitchens, one by a outfit one by a friend and one by myself so I know the time and cost and a coworker went to Ikea for the identical kitchen I had and the install was more than the product. And if the job is prepped and you know what you are doing it is only 6-8 to install cabinets. I think you should quit while you are behind. I can tell by your rhetoric you have NEVER installed anything except maybe plugging in a video game controller!

       I'm not sure what to do about all that bigger picture stuff, but don't buy into the corporate culture as best you can.  Buy local when possible.  If it's a product on Amazon you really need, check to see if the seller of the product sells it on their own website.  It'll almost always be the same price, and they often provide coupons that offset shipping or even makes it cheaper to purchase directly.  It'll just take an extra week to get it.

       This is exactly what I do but I find with most I don't need a coupon or anything, the shipping is just free. I also usually get it in just a few days but with Amazon, since I don't have prime, it takes a week just to leave their warehouse.

       They are trying their best to make this country not look like Bangladesh, Kenya, Uganda or any other banana republic but epically failing. It's just that bad.
      </p>
      <p>
       In fact America is indeed a banana republic on the leagues of Kenya, Bangladesh, Indonesia and other stuff. The big cooperations all over the place don't make it any better; They make it worse.
      </p>
      <p>
       If we had streets of mom and pop stores instead of cooperate infested buildings, we may even look a lot less like a banana republic. But the truth is this country is going straight into a banana republic and we all know it.

       I actually have no problem with Amazon or Walmart.  They are only distributors.   They did what any smart entrepreneur would do.  Scale to a global level.  Jet even competed with amazon as a startup and sold for several billion dollars.

       Complaining over and over again isnt going to fix the problem though, post solutions.  Example: create anopther jet to squeeze in on amazon's and walmart's profits

       Here's the thing though. When a local business does try to compete, they do well. Where I live, two locally owned grocery stores have managed to run Kroger, Albertson's, Brookshires and Safeway out of town, and have split the local market between themselves. The closest Wal-Mart Supercenter is miles away and on the other side of the interstate in order to not conflict, and even stopped price matching long before they did company wide recently.
      </p>
      <p>
       Their prices aren't really as competitive, but they offer fresh, custom cut meat and fresh local produce. They consider Wal-Mart a non-issue. Too many of these mom and pop shops that are being oppressed by big bad Wal-Mart are trying to mark their products at triple Wal-Mart retail and expecting you to hunt down whatever place they stocked it, and they're not intending on helping you look for it.

       Definitely agree with what you say, but it does require to have the type of demographics (upper-middle class) to support a business that offers as increase in quality for an increase in price.

       It's not even an upper middle class area. The prices aren't that much more than Wal-Mart, 5-10 cents on average. They just do the job better, something most mom and pop stores don't even take a cursory stab at.

       Nah, it's not Whole Foods pricing, but the conventional wisdom is that the Wal-Mart would be dominating and killing the local stores, which is the exact opposite of what's happening. In inclement weather situations, they frequently sell out of milk and bread well before the Wal-Mart. I've seen them selling Wal-Mart product before ice storms because they ran through their stock and went over and bought unsold Wal-Mart merchandise.

       Someone needs to start a corporation, and then give away free stock to those that qualify. The corporation could do it all. It could manufacture everything, and provide every service imaginable. The only thing necessary is that the people who are the first to join are excellent in their trade or skills. The main corporation holds 51% of the stock, meaning it is in control, and the other 49% is broken up into small companies whose owners have served their dues by working as "apprentices". Once they have served their apprenticeship they are given ownership of their new small business. They own 49%, while the main corporation owns 51%. The little business owner must follow strict guidelines and regulations to keep the business honest and competitive. There is more to this, but this idea could put all those large corporations out of business.

       I had an idea that there should be a minimum wholesale price for any item and that's it. No discounts for bulk etc... just one 'this is the bottom wholesale price" and all wholesalers sell this item at this price.
      </p>
      <p>
       Smaller shops get the same price as a huge discount store. It levels the playing field for small business versus the big players.
      </p>
      <p>
       When a major corporation can buy in bulk and sell for far less than a local business... guess who is going to go out of business?

       Throw some tax relief into real and true small businesses and maybe the damage could be contained from the huge corps.

       The issue with this is that you are basically arguing against the very idea of capitalism. When business is made to be more efficient and cheaper the consumers benefit and the need for a strong workforce diminish. This workforce is now displaced, but it opens up room for them to go to another area of the economy that could use more attention.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm sure people are happy to use Amazon over having to 15 dollars for relatively cheap orders that shouldn't require such a high shipping price.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course the displacement is uncomfortable, but technology brings jobs and destroys them. It may of given you walmart, amazon, and netflix which kills small business, yet it has also given you call centers, information technology support, computer repair, and factories (which displaced a lot of skilled labor I might add).

       I'll have to use batman as an example here but batman, a character that defies all odds, always says "There is always a way".  This is optimist. There is always a way is a true statement.
      </p>
      <p>
       Pessimists usually think of a complex problem and when they are unable to resolve it quickly, they simply give up deeming it impossible. What they don't realize is that there is a way to solve the problem but they simply don't know the solution yet. Instead of working towards a solution, they simply give up and deem the problem to be unsolvable.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was trained to be an optimist in the military like many others. It takes trial and error to become an optimist. Belief is the most important step. Pessimists often give up before even trying because they simply dont belive things are possible.

       So 'optimism' is synonymous with
       <strong>
        delusion
       </strong>
       to you, then.

       and yet we've managed to live as a species for an incredible amount of time, creating countless works of beauty and wonder... I don't agree that humans are antithetical to a sustainable system.  In fact, I believe we are a critical component.  I also don't deny we have the capacity for self destruction, and perhaps it will occur if we continue to indulge our basest desires, but if we decide instead to focus on our higher inclinations, for the benefit of all living beings, life's systems could easily thrive!  Probably to a degree that we currently cannot even imagine.  At times it seems we are just on the cusp taking this incredible step forward, perhaps it is closer than you think.

       Batman is a pessimist, bro. That's a big part of his character and why he acts like he does. I think you have him confused with Superman.

       Nah, think metaphysical - your conscience. It will be the most profitable way the globe's largest trillion dollar entities can still expand. Unless, of course, economic systems collapse under their own weight first.
