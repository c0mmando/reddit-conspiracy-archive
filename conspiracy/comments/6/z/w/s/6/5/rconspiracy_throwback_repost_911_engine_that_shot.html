<p>Take note of the engine type this cooling duct assembly is used on. It is used on the JT9D-7 series.</p>

<p>This is the cooling duct assembly used on the JT9D-7R4D, which was the engine used for Flight 175:</p>

<p>The name of the component is HPT Stage1 Cooling Duct Assembly. There is a history behind this assembly as I began to read more. This component was part of the early JT9D-7 series engines that were used in development of Boeing&#39;s 747 line of aircraft. The &quot;7&quot; series engines have gone through many revisions but are exclusively used on 747&#39;s. Many years later, P&amp;W decided to work with NASA in the development in a new technology to improve engine performance and reliability. This improvement was made specifically to this section of engine. Tangential On-Board Injection (TOBI or &quot;R&quot; for Radial) was the newest improvement to reduce nozzle temperatures by over 2% which could open the door for a more powerful engines based on the &quot;7&quot; series engine. The new model of engine would be called 7R4+Revision Letter. The 7R4D engine is the one that is specified for United Airlines Boeing 767&#39;s.</p>

<p>The engine found at Church and Murray didn&#39;t seem to be a 7R4D.....it seemed to be a 7J. The only way to confirm this is to search for the engine and take a look at the diffuser casing to verify a match. This was another needle in a haystack but I found it......a photo of a stripped down 747 engine at an outdoor museum. The diffuser casing is a perfect match!</p>

<p><a href="http://ckpi.typepad.com/.a/6a00e00982d2c988330120a568bf6c970b-500wi">http://ckpi.typepad.com/.a/6a00e00982d2c988330120a568bf6c970b-500wi</a></p>

<p>Take note of the arrows to see that they match the JT9D-7 series engine on the 747 shown in the photo. Click to enlarge.</p>

<p><a href="http://ckpi.typepad.com/.a/6a00e00982d2c988330120a5bf5ddd970c-500wi">http://ckpi.typepad.com/.a/6a00e00982d2c988330120a5bf5ddd970c-500wi</a></p>

<p>&quot;We have two data points indicating that the Murray Street engine is a Pratt and Whitney JT9D-7 series engine: the HPT Stage 1 Cooling Duct Assembly which the manufacturer indicates is for use only with the 7 series engine, and we have the diffuser casing of the Murray Street engine matching perfectly the diffuser casing of a 747 engine --for which model of Boeing aircraft Weezula says the JT9D-7 series engine was exclusively used.&quot;
All data so far seem to indicate that the Murray Street engine is not a JT9D-7R4D engine, as would have been on Flight 175. (And the Murray Street engine certainly is not a GE CF6 engine from Flight 11.)</p>

<p>&quot;So how did a 7-series 747 engine wind up on Murray Street?&quot;</p>

<p>it could not be used 15 year ago as the rope attached  to it to lower it between the buildings did not release. so it sat there unloved until recently, then announced then quickly forgotten as people commented on the rope.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ahh yes. No one would have noticed people coming in with a destroyed engine and placing it on the street. And the people who placed it there would have zero questions as to why they were ordered to drop an engine on the street. More importantly, do you even have the original source for this picture? I have googled a bunch of terms and can&#39;t seem to find that it&#39;s real.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My take from that is that he concludes that both of the rings are used in the JT9D-7R4D. The post from Metabunk also shows <a href="https://plus.google.com/+FredRobel/posts/HmQ8WfDkQVj">this</a> and <a href="https://plus.google.com/photos/photo/103855693260433954309/6415900218540985570?icm=false&amp;amp;iso=true&amp;amp;authkey=COHik5md87iuzQE">this</a> photo. </p>

<p>I always believed the engine found on Murray Street did not align with the facts about the enigine used in the plane. I have to concede however that these photos, by a everyday mechanic, indicate that the Murray Street engine is indeed the JT9D-7R4D.</p>
