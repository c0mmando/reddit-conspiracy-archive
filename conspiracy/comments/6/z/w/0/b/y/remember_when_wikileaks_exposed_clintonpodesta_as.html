    <div class="md"><p>i thought a lot about what sort of thing would require you to do awful things to children and the only thing i could come up with is a way to show you are completely devoid of empathy.</p>

<p>now why would you ever need to do that? well lets think a bit about the who in this theory. well weve got world leaders and the ruling &quot;elite&quot; why would a lack of empathy be a requirement for the club?</p>

<p>well if you are making daily decisions that can result in starvation, war, death etc. then that becomes a highly prized quality.</p>

<p>IF the dirty pedo/murder shit has any merit that imho is going to be  the job interview stage, showing that you can ignore the welfare of a single person completely, its like a buy in. saying hey i just fucked/murdered that child who was totally innocent just to get in to this club is one hell of a statement. </p>

<p>in doing so you would have shown you can make decision with out a conscience, and given them the dirt to show that you are going to stay in line. this could be a slow escalation sort of thing, starts off with drugs -&gt; hookers -&gt; kids -&gt; murder -&gt; torture etc. each bridge being one you don&#39;t really have the options of walking back over and getting out once your in.</p>

<p>this is why i find it all so terrifying, there is a really fucked up logic behind it that would come from sociopaths.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I personally think the occult allegations are disinformation to steer people away from the UFO emails in the Podesta leaks. If you&#39;re familiar with the UFO world, you will be aware that 95 percent of what you read and see is made by disinformation agents and trolls or people repeating disinformation rumors. It takes a while before you find really good information.  </p>

<p>Check Podesta&#39;s Twitter account. Here are a few tweets about UFO&#39;s</p>

<p>You can check news articles on it. Google &quot;Podesta UFO.&quot; This dude really believes in aliens. </p>

<p>You can go through wikileaks and check out all of the Podesta emails. Search &quot;alien,&quot; &quot;UFO,&quot; or whatever else you think is relevant. There are a lot of them. </p>

<p>This one in particular looks pretty crazy, and was released by wikileaks on the same day as Pizzagate got started (Oct 30, 2016). <a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/36957">https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/36957</a></p>

<p>It looks like Podesta forwarded this email. He wrote &quot;FYI&quot; and sent a forward to Leslie Kean with a bunch of UFO information on it. <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/author/leslie-kean">(Leslie Kean is an investigative journalist who writes about UFOs).</a> </p>

<p>For clarity&#39;s sake, the top message is a reply from Kean to Podesta. Underneath that is Podesta&#39;s &quot;FYI&quot; forward to Kean. Below that is a message to Podesta from another person who divulged information about a UFO program. Kean received the entire email from Podesta. </p>

<p>Since it was written before Oct 30, you might say <em>&quot;Wouldn&#39;t the government already know about this email, so it shouldn&#39;t matter when it was released?&quot;</em> I&#39;m not sure. Maybe the government gets so much data that they didn&#39;t notice it until then. I&#39;m not even sure if there is a connection here, but I wanted to start the conversation off somewhere. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think both are real. The US government, however, isn&#39;t in contact with aliens so they&#39;re almost as in the dark as we are, apart from what they hear from insiders of the MIC who work to back engineer downed alien craft and work on advanced tech for their own benefit.<br/>
The occult stuff is hard to explain, but the way I see it is as a science. It&#39;s essentially the <em>real</em> way the universe (as we know it) works, so they know all the tricks to manipulating reality (conscious intention, belief, manifestation etc) which is why they push so much of what&#39;s almost pseudoscience onto us. General relativity, for example. It&#39;s like we get the science that focuses on the effects, whereas they keep the science that focuses on the cause to themselves. I think it&#39;s also kept secret to hide that aliens are here, since their craft would run using related principles. Demons and things I think are can be both real in the &quot;physical&quot; sort of sense, and in just the metaphorical sense. It just depends on your perspective how you see them. (this is what I mean when I say it&#39;s hard to explain. They both are and aren&#39;t &quot;real&quot;, depends on the conscious observer and interaction. Some quantum shit).<br/>
And I think a major reason we&#39;re fed so much disinfo is to direct mass consciousness away from that, because conscious thought literally changes reality. And if we all knew that, then they&#39;d literally have no power over us. I&#39;m gonna link some comments and/or posts in some edits in a bit that I think will help explain. So bear with me on that. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Most occult traditions include secrecy for a few reasons:
1) People freak out about it.  They pass laws against it, set you on fire, that kind of thing.  Totally rubbish, but there you have it.<br/>
2) Many ancient religions had mysteries- you couldn&#39;t know the important stuff unless you were initiated.  This includes Greece, Egypt, Rome, and the Middle East (including Judaism).  The occult traditions of today mostly derive from those religions.   Even hunter gatherer groups with shamans tend to restrict the training to the shaman.  This is generally because you don&#39;t want to have any ol&#39; jackass talking to the gods or spirits because offending them was considered a huge mistake.
3) Its a method of safeguarding/gatekeeping knowledge to prevent idiots from harming themselves or others with the information.  There&#39;s always somebody who wants to summon a demon of the pit to help them find their car keys, or know how to cast a love spell...
4) Honestly, it just feels cool to a lot of people to be keepers of special knowledge that not everybody has access to, members of a special club.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re referring to frequenters of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, you&#39;ve just put your ignorance on display.  Most people whom are aware of conspiracies are also aware that religion is nothing but a control system.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Whenever people post about how frustrated they are with how obvious the agenda is and how corrupt TPTB are and yadda yadda, I always reference one of the later seasons of The X-Files.  Mulder finally has the whole picture by season 7 or so and he writes a book capturing every detail.  He goes on talk shows and and book tours; and everyone laughs at him.  They call him &quot;Spooky&quot; just like at the FBI and play him off as we do Alex Jones.  Then the show goes off the rails and turns to shit, but I still like that Mulder just gives up and goes to live in a shack with a Unabomber beard and newspaper clippings all over the wall.  Why bother?</p>

<p>You can lead a mouth-breathing jackass to water but you can&#39;t make them drink.  If people find the truth inconvenient, they&#39;ll happily ignore it to accommodate they&#39;re lack of depth.  TPTB have done a wonderful job of breeding a world full of anti-intellectual thugs who all think they deserve to be famous.  Human trash you were never going to save anyway.  Hopefully this community survives the grid going down and society&#39;s ultimate collapse, but I could give a shit less about the Sodomites dancing around Katy Perry&#39;s golden calf.  They deserve whatever the Soros agenda has in store for them.  I hope they&#39;re enslaved like the Pharaohs by whatever benefactor steps in.  But, you know, <em>wooo! YOLO! Being a generally bad person is mostly nonpunishable!  Party!</em></p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is true but God has worked through Kings all through the Bible.  William Tyndale prayed that the King&#39;s Eyes would be opened as he was burning at the stake (being burned by the Catholics).  The Jesuits are major players with all the Satanic stuff going on in the world.  That&#39;s why so much pedophilia and abuse comes out of that church.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It really has to be studied out but here is an example of comparing the KJV to the NKJV which most people think is an innocent update.  The NIV is the worst because that book will allow it&#39;s readers to think the Antichrist is actually Jesus Christ&#39;s 2nd coming.  The spiritual deception goes just as deep as the worldly deception:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The brain&#39;s complexity is mathematically constructed. There&#39;s an interesting field called topology which when used to model connections between neurons over time reveals the changing structure of thought. The brain seems to work like a biological processor, sorting and retrieving information while responding to stimuli. We don&#39;t know yet how these physical reactions produce the sensation of consciousness, but you can&#39;t claim it to be a mystery with no answer in sight. Scientists love to study the brain, it is the most complex organic thing we know about aside from dna, and we&#39;ve already sequenced and modified that. </p>

<p>Understanding consciousness will be key to the creation of artificial intelligence, but we may have to wait for quantum computers first since binary code is not a good method for simulating organic thought, based on what we know about how neurons behave.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good question. There is still a lot of mystery out there in the world - the universe. I absolutely cannot claim that we are even a fraction of the way to unlocking all the answers. But I&#39;d like to ask you if you think it&#39;s any coincidence that the more we understand about the natural word through science, the less we attribute to magic, superstition, or god. </p>

<p>We definitely don&#39;t know what came before the big bang. We will likely never know. The way I approach these sorts of questions is pretty simple though. If there is no evidence for something, I will automatically be skeptical of it. On the origin of the universe, some say that God necessarily created it. However, that&#39;s tautological reasoning - it only moves the goal-post one step further and doesn&#39;t really answer the basic question about the origin of the universe. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;d say almost certainly. To that end though, just because someone cannot currently be answered by science does not mean that it is necessarily answered by something else. In general, the absence of evidence is not proof that anything exists - just because science might not currently have an explanation for something does not mean that mysticism is by default the correct answer. </p>

<p>Superstition is waning because science has offered definitive answers to timeless questions. I do get what approach you&#39;re getting from but I think my default stance for questions we do not now or may never know the answers to is agnosticism, not theism. </p>

 You don&#39;t know shit about the occult. But you don&#39;t even acknowledge that simple fact without going on your atheistic rants. So why even waste my time on someone who quite blatantly refuses to do their own research for themselves?</p>

<p>Prove where I said I believed in the existence of magick. And no it&#39;s not a call for evidence.

<blockquote>
<p>Do you believe magic exists? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>No. However I do attribute the things we don&#39;t scientifically understand to a higher power. Even with my beliefs I do accept any proof showing I&#39;m incorrect. Humans are fallible and won&#39;t learn unless we accept our faults and wrongdoings. If I&#39;m proven absolutely there is no God in any form, than I will change my tune and proudly admit I&#39;m wrong.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What is the purpose of studying/following the occult to you? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>To learn things that some people are just afraid to learn themselves. Yeah, there are a lot of nutty people when it comes to the occult. But a lot of the modern misconceptions are just false. Which is what really got me started with my path a few years ago. If I&#39;m wrong about this or that, what else am I wrong about? You know what I&#39;m saying? But bow that I&#39;ve found my place, I continue to learn and study all forms of religion or practice because it  gives me a greater understanding of humanity and that living a life of love, regardless of differences, is what will make the world a beautiful place again.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Do you feel that following the occult, does anything? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>My best answer is yes and no. Most people just don&#39;t follow the &quot;occult.&quot; There are many, many different religions and practices. I personally follow Thelema. But learning about other religions, cultures, and lifestyles opens the eye to the fact that nobody is all that different. We&#39;re all living life to our own understanding and making what we can of it. So I use what I&#39;ve to love everyone as my own regardless of who they are. In the grand scheme, people like me aren&#39;t changing the world. But the obvious first step of that is to positively shape those around you.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>To the title of the post, why do you believe that the elite practice the occult, if they do? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>People follow what&#39;s called The left hand path, or the right hand path. The elite follow left hand path. Which is more focused on evil intent to gain control and manipulate those around you. The more powerful and influential you become, the more likely it is to control as many people as possible for your own gain. Cue Bohemian Grove. You can still be skeptical, but do you see where pieces can falk together here? Whether or not magick exists, the people involved are still getting more and more powerful. Which would make anyone believe what they&#39;re doing works. </p>

<p>Hopefully I answered everything clearly enough. I&#39;ve had a few drinks, so it might be fucky. Obligatory apology for length.</p>

<p>Do you feel that the left hand path is necessarily evil or that the elite are also necessarily malicious in their intent? Do you feel that there are also elite who follow the right hand path - if so, who?

</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t believe any form of practice is necessarily malicious. It&#39;s the people who use their knowledge for evil intent that are the problem. However when it comes to the darker aspects of the occult, there are some tradeoffs.</p>

<p>For a loose example those who believe in summoning demons. Demons have existed much longer than humans have. That knowledge can be used to either sway a proposition in their favor. So hypothetically the upper echelons of government were to summon a demon or whatever. Yeah, it gives them what they want, but only on the demons terms. </p>

<p>As to people in government on the right hand path? I don&#39;t know. Even if I did, I&#39;d be of the belief that they are much more likely to be corrupted than someone like me. Power corrupts, but absolute power corrupts absolutely. You either play ball or go home. I feel like there&#39;s really no saving the power structure in America. But that just goes back to changing those around you. We can all grow out of a system of corruption and hate together.</p>

<p>All Skull and Bones members graduate and go on to attend Bohemiam Grove ceremonies. So I guess these people just perform dark &quot;art&quot; for a few decades of their lives...but it can&#39;t be anything other than just weird art...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well at that point he was responding to my part about bohemian grove which is what he quoted. In that regards I&#39;d say there is more than enough evidence.</p>

<p>If I have a bunch of secretely recorded videos of someone performing cult rituals and they are in fact in secrety cults (bohemian grove and skull &amp; bones) then it&#39;s pretty safe to say they are doing more than art. I&#39;m not sure what additional evidence you need other than a bunch of 70 year old white dudes wearing robes at 4am while praying to an owl God and doing a mock human sacrifice while chanting some weird shit.</p>

<p>In regards to Clinton..I don&#39;t really go around pushing the occult narrative thing but if you listen to this famous artist who does spirit cooking she says something like &quot;the art that is out in public is part of the performance but when I do it in private with people it&#39;s an intimate experience&quot; According to Podesta&#39;s e-mails he was doing this spirit cooking shit in private. Take it for what it&#39;s worth.</p>

<p>I have not looked into that yet so i&#39;m not gonna judge. But I believe that there are &#39;fraternitys&#39; like skulls &amp; bones which will lead to behavior that might be seen as a conspiracy. However, I believe that those are just really there for tradition and having a connection when they meet in business and politics later. To give jobs to each other, to make money together and so on. Not to kill children in occult rituals and have an international child trafficking ring.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Of course they do, why would you make it in public. You know how many weird private art performances there are every week in New York? Of course the amount of participants will be limited, therefore private. </p>

<p>This will increase the interest and make those stupid events really really special in the hipster art scene. Marina knows that she can make a shitton of money that way. People like Podesta are super rich and already have everything. They need some weird shit to get excited.</p>

<p>Couldn&#39;t this also be an explanation ?</p>

<p>I watched it back then and when her name started popping up in reference to a bunch of weird stuff I wasn&#39;t surprised at all. She&#39;s a performance artist and from what I gathered from the documentary her art pretty much focuses on the extremes humans will go to when the art encourages it.

    <div class="md"><p>Well, I was actually hesitant to write what I wrote, because I perceive that part of this sub&#39;s character (perhaps even charm, or strength) is to think outside of the black-and-white and to look at disparate, sometimes esoteric, elements with genuine curiosity and try to bring things together in creative ways.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t want to destroy that part of the sub&#39;s character, nor discourage it, but there are some very cynical people (not saying OP necessarily) who take advantage of it to push blatant political agendas, and seek to set the bar very low indeed in terms of evidence to demonize their ideological foes.</p>

<p>And yes, I consider Pizzagate to have originated in such a way. So, although I work in child protection services myself, I&#39;m very leery of anything with a (now) Pedogate label attached to it, even though I&#39;m sure there&#39;s heaps of people involved who are genuinely concerned about kids. </p>

I can&#39;t even remember the last time Christians pushed their ideology on me. The daily shit you deal with comes directly from your media devices. My uncle founded a somewhat large evangelical ministry and the only time I hear &quot;Bible bashing&quot; is when they post a verse from the Bible on Facebook. It never comes up at work or the gas station or walking down the street, that&#39;s ridiculous. The media and Hollywood (both CIA) are pushing anti-Christian bigotry and simultaneously creating groups like ISIS to divide us cattle. I wont buy into their garbage anymore. I don&#39;t claim to know what God is or the meaning of life but I&#39;m aware enough to know that the media&#39;s content creators are fucking with us.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It certainly is.  Have you ever been to the South?</p>

<p>Christians use their overwhelming majority to enact laws that affect all Americans, to shape foreign policy, to bully and silence dissenters, to place their creepy iconography everywhere, to rewrite American history, even to physically and mentally abuse children, all the while crying about how bad they have it.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a weird ass sex cult that has managed to place it&#39;s mythos above both logic and the law, and we all suffer for it.  That&#39;s not media fuckery, that&#39;s the reality of their actions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was correcting you because you said about everybody not agreeing with you is worshipping demons, which is definitely not true and has nothing to do with beliefs, just plain logic.</p>

<p>And now you are deflecting, leaving the original discussion point, mentioning that I could be brainwashed by the CIA. That could be true, of course. I would not rule that out. The only thing I have is logic and asking you questions about your theories so I can form an opinion. So far most of you people&#39;s arguments are not good enough unfortunately. I have seen some good (non-wild) conspiracy theories here, that&#39;s why am a reader. There are people that really have a point, but this is sub mostly went insane, I don&#39;t think you were here years ago when things were a bit more analytical and not so easily dismissable.</p>

<p>Same goes the other way though, they could also have programmed you to believe in things to keep you from finding the real conspiracies. So this argument is worthless.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I super fucking care. But admittedly I feel that there aren&#39;t nearly enough people willing to accept the level of treachery and depravity sewn into the very fabric of most societies worldwide to make any meaningful progress. </p>

<p>It&#39;s a cynical view, I know, but it&#39;s been thousands of years ping ponging between one set of psychotic rulers and the next. </p>

<p>At a certain point you have to start asking yourself how can this be the state of things so consistently for so long? Statistics should dictate a shift back and forth for at least a little while here and there. </p>

<p>Which is why I, a non religious, skeptically spiritual person, have been starting to suspect that all occultism and all that &quot;hocus pocus Bohemian Grove&quot; shit might actually work. </p>

<p>It sounds ridiculous to discuss with almost everyone. I&#39;m way too scared to try it myself. But fuck man - dark forces RUN this planet. Expecting anything else is pointless.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great post but I want to point out one thing I noticed since I don&#39;t have time to read the whole thing. That list of 213 things not allowed to do in the army is pretty old. It&#39;s from a site that doesn&#39;t seem to work anymore here <a href="http://skippyslist.com/list/">http://skippyslist.com/list/</a>. It was just a comedy site.</p>

<p>It might be just a coincidence that his name is Skippy. I remember seeing that thing a while ago. I would guess that because of the name and the subject matter they just pasted it all onto an email. </p>

<p>Unless Podesta was the author but nothing in his emails leads me to think any of these people are witty enough to be that funny.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It really has to be studied out but here is an example of comparing the KJV to the NKJV which most people think is an innocent update.  The NIV is the worst because that book will allow it&#39;s readers to think the Antichrist is actually Jesus Christ&#39;s 2nd coming.  The spiritual deception goes just as deep as the worldly deception:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Is it not possible we&#39;re limited to our understanding of the mysteries because of how we approach trying understanding things? You said belief in the superstitious diminished as our understanding of science grows, but is there a chance trying to objectively measure things with our understanding of science has limited our understanding of things that can&#39;t be observed with our current science? So by virtue of that, a lot of mysterious things are dismissed simply because we&#39;re incapable of objectively entertaining the possibility of it?  </p>

<p>I hope you understand what I&#39;m trying to get at there.</p>

<p><em>The obscure group Ordo Templi Orientis (OTO) claims Dr Reina Michaelson and the Child Sexual Abuse Prevention Program described it in a website article as a satanic cult that sacrificed children and ate their organs and blood.</em></p>
