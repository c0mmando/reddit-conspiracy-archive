       This comment, right? Is it because you mentioned the Bush family? Maybe this just goes too hard against the whitewash of Bush II we have been seeing so much of recently?

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Islam mixed with Bush family mafia.  Remember that building 7 came down at free fall speed with nothing hitting it and very few fires.

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       And remember that people WERE STANDING in the holes where the 747's hit the towers, showing that there were no raging fires on the top floors:

       The censorship at T_D is infuriating.  I was (still am) a
       <em>
        hardcore
       </em>
       supporter of the Trump movement (though increasingly disappointed with a lot of the things Trump is doing).  I posted at T_D regularly during the last 6 months of the election, but got banned there repeatedly for pointing out "verboten" truths, such as jewish power in the Western world.

       Not him but it's more of a clique of nepotism imo. They put things like israel and any other issues that benefit them before issues that benefit others. That also applies to areas of the economy they dominate - like the news, entertainment, and financial industries. They want to give those industries leeway because they know they are mostly filled with jews.

       They don't, though? Like, most polls of American Jews show that more than half don't consider Israel to be extremely important. In fact, it's a major point of disagreement among American Jews...

       When people mention The Jews, they aren't talking about your typical Jew you meet on the street, they're talking about the Zionists. There's a huge difference.

      <p>
       To answer your original question: Yes they have a master plan. They are always conniving and pulling strings around the world. Their plan isn't to create some Utopia for all -- it's for dominance and control over the world. They see it as their right and believe they are superior to the rest of us.

       Oh so we're also including a hell of a lot of non-Jews in this too? Zionists are certainly more organized than Jews are.

       Zionists believe this? Really? How do they go about coordinating between the Evangelical anti-Semitic branch and Bebe? Do they also include the UN and the UK foreign office in their plans? Maybe the King of Jordan too?

       I can't help but think you're here to undermine the discourse by throwing out random questions and also your demeaning tone of "Really?" and imposing that it's the rest of us feeling inferior that makes us believe they are superior. Anyways, I'll entertain you.

       Yes they believe it. There's plenty of Zionists that have stated their goals and also their disdain for the rest of us. We are beneath them, according to them. It's not us who feel inferior, it's them who feel superior. Don't try to put the burden on us.

        Zionists believe this? Really? How do they go about coordinating between the Evangelical anti-Semitic branch and Bebe? Do they also include the UN and the UK foreign office in their plans? Maybe the King of Jordan too?

       I don't know. I'm not gonna pretend I know who is and isn't in on the big boys club, just that there's a group at the top with a lot of power pulling strings. They've infiltrated countries around the world and installed them into power positions, their involvement in false flags around the world to change laws and shape public views to their benefit shows their attempt at power grabs. The threat of Zionism is very real.

       Holy shit you just can't stop, can you. Stop putting the burden on someone for how someone else feels. I don't give a shit if a Zionist believes they are superior to me, but guess what? That doesn't stop them from believing they are superior.

       To democracy, freedom, rights - just about everything that gives us power. Seeing as it's the anniversary of 9/11, look at their involvement in 9/11 and the repercussions that has had for the entire world. The world was never the same after that. It made it worse for the people and better for those who want power over the people.

       I mean, honestly, I am dumb on this subject. I simply do not know why the hell this particular brand of co-organized people should be lifted above the many other similar groups. The only reasonable solution I can come up with is that, since they're ostensibly pro-Jewish, it must be some sort of latent anti-semitism.

       If you are done being deliberately obtuse; Zionists of different factions (ie: Evangelical Christians, the Israelis blah blah) defend and push the Zionist agenda because they believe that the reestablishment of Israel in the Holy Land is necessary to bring about their shitty fan-fic book's version of the "End Times".
      </p>
      <p>
       The Jews believe they are God's chosen people. The Christians believe that when Revelation happens they will be taken in the rapture and put in the fast lane to heaven instead of having to be left behind to witness the devastation.

       <p>
        The Protocols of the Meetings of the Learned Elders of Zion is an antisemitic fabricated text purporting to describe a Jewish plan for global domination. The forgery was first published in Russia in 1903, translated into multiple languages, and disseminated internationally in the early part of the 20th century. According to the claims made by some of its publishers, the Protocols are the minutes of a late 19th-century meeting where Jewish leaders discussed their goal of global Jewish hegemony by subverting the morals of Gentiles, and by controlling the press and the world's economies.
       </p>
       <p>
        Henry Ford funded printing of 500,000 copies that were distributed throughout the U.S. in the 1920s. The Nazis sometimes used the Protocols as propaganda against Jews; it was assigned by some German teachers, as if factual, to be read by German schoolchildren after the Nazis came to power in 1933, despite having been exposed as fraudulent by The Times of London in 1921.
        <strong>
         It is still widely available today in numerous languages, in print and on the Internet, and continues to be presented by some proponents as a genuine document.

       "My only proof of their authenticity is the fact that I read them." Okay, my friend. We all read the Bible too, hell we all read the 9/11 report. You want to keep telling me how things are authentic because they have words in them?

       Oh okay. I guess they have all those secret meetings where they go over the plans and make sure to have agents in all the right places. Fuck-it, they didn't even bother changing names, or not openly practicing a religion. It's like they don't care if we know... Or, more likely, they're not doing anything.

       Do I deny that there are Jews in this world? No. Do I deny that there are people in positions of power in the fields you listed? No. Do I think there's any basis to assume that the religion of the latter group is relevant to their decision making? Why, no sir, I do not.

       No.  It is not viewed as a "hoax" by "everyone".  Most of those people have never even read it.  There are many, many people who know it is genuine.  And smearing them with the stupid smear term "anti-semite" is not a rational argument and does not refute the fact that the document is genuine and describes an agenda that is being executed in reality.

       Are we just guessing which two? Because from where I sit, all of them are implausible. Including the core idea; you have no idea how Jews organize themselves and for some odd-ass reason seem to believe that they follow orders from their religious leaders. Which is patently false, by and large in Jewish communities.

       What kind of disingenuous shit is this, dude. You know damn well that asking people their religion and then changing your responses to them based on that comes really close to bigotry. Worse, if it's only related to Jews, then you are damn close to anti-semitism. Don't act like you don't know this, and don't act like you don't skirt the rules really closely on shit like this.

       As a whole, they do not. Do some individual Jews have positions of power? Yes, they do. Just as a fuckload of Christians, Jains, Muslims, Buddhists have power through the world. Hell, even Atheists have power.

       TIL that literally every single idea held by the establishment is terrible. Fuck blind justice. Fuck the idea of rights. Fuck the concept of representative democracy. None of these things are acceptable for
       <em>
        anyone
       </em>
       to believe in because the "establishment" also believes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Are you serious right now? Do you solely define your self worth through the lens of "whatever the majority supports I don't?" You couldn't be more petty than that.
