       Same here, folks.
      </p>
      <p>
       But, it's hard not to feel the pressure of a lot of folks talking about it. I feel for the simple fact that it's brought up so much, gives it some credibility ... but, so did the rest of those dates. 2012 for example ... but then again, apparently we got "shifted" during that time and avoided it.

       I'm not one to freak out over doomsday, cause whats the point - you're here the next day or not.

       Since all the Sept 23rd stuff is popping up - where is it originating from exactly?! It kinda just started coming on to my radar last year

       Whats different from the others is that in this one a large part of the conspiracy is something hidden in the galaxy, that is actually being censored away on google universe. Thats what got me intrigued. Look it up

       Oh I have, haha. And trust me ... would love to believe that a lot of us are able to see through the BS and know what's really going on out there.

      <p>
       But, as the others, there was this and that to "show" that this time is real.

      <p>
       I for one have watched about 500 videos or more on the whole Nibiru thing, including recent sightings, space photos, infared videos, etc, and I agree something is strange... but i can't know for sure.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you know where it all started?! I see some folks saying it's bible related as well as amateur/professional researchers talking about it. Just curious how sept 23rd was settled upon initially? Maybe a leak of an estimated timeframe?

       Somewhat bible related, if you are into that. The bible is just copies of older religions, that tell the same tale. The 23 is because thats when the allignment of stars and planets are perfect. Then Nibiru can be born or whatever. If i remember correcly, the last time they lined up like that was some 7000 years ago, but that could be completely wrong.

       Not overly into the bible stuff, for those reasons.
      </p>
      <p>
       But, the alignment of the stars, and planets ... that's interesting to me. I have read that ancient cultures have written and spoke of this stuff, and it's been much the same conversation/message that we are chatting about now.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm with you ... the internet/TPTB have done a great job and throwing so much info out on every single topic, that sometimes it's hard to know what's coming vs what isnt.
      </p>
      <p>
       Someone saying it's a definite no is just as bad as saying it's a definite yes. We're both reading 2nd hand info given to us, and for someone to stand on one side of the fence saying theyre right, is silly to me, since I don't see much of a difference.
      </p>

       I hope you wake up on the 24th as well and get to have a laugh.

       Acient culture is something you should dive into right away. That is so incredibly interesting, and when you see all the amazing things around the world, hidden from mainstream eyes.. mind boggling! up untill recently I thought the Giza pyramide and the mayan civilization were the only thing of value. There are major cities and vast structures being uncovered all the time, and one thing i can say for sure, the acients were at least as knowledgeable as us, if not more.

       haha, I agree. Years ago I touched base on it a little - but that was due to some of the 2012 stuff being said - which came and passed - unless it didn't, and the whole reality is a much stranger thing than we think - which, I'm down with .... I see some shit every day that boggles my mind at times haha.
      </p>
      <p>
       I bet there is a great thread linking all this stuff together on some corner of the internet - like the ancients talking and writing of this stuff, plus the signs they spoke of, plus modern proof ... I'm into the whole Nibiru thing ... not sure why scientists would announce it, and then "take it back". I feel some of this stuff is just too coincidental.
      </p>
      <p>
       Have anything interesting for me to read in regards to this thread topic?!
      </p>
      <p>
       Thanks for the good chats. I love a good chat back and forth, regardless of the view you may hold ... I feel thats what this place should be for. We could probably figure out a whole bunch more if we didn't spend the time here saying one another is stupid for believing one thing over another ... as most things are possible, and all of the 2nd hand info is just that ... it's just obvious you'll find more proof if they're writing the proof to fit the lie.

       Yeah this is exactly what it should be used for. I feel there is like 5-6 different conspiracy theorists here and none can talk together. Its a mess.

       Is it Nibiru or acient history you want? I havent been down the Nibiru road in a while, figured i shouldnt wrap my head to much around that. At least not so long before the 23.

       I believe so... Personally, the 21-22nd being a big holiday makes me think it may be during these two days we get fucked by asteroids. The 23rd would be the beginning of a new year should we live to see it. Hopefully i'm just crazy.

       The beginning of the new Hebrew year is the 21st (technically 20th at sunset, Yerushalayim time) thats what the Holy festival is celebrating afterall.
      </p>
      <p>
       The 23rd is the date of the divine astronomical alignment fulfilling
       <strong>
        Revelation:1-2
       </strong>
       exactly AFTER the holiday, which is the next prophesized day for Yeshua to fulfill.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's NOT the End of the world people. It's the Beginning of the End.

       Nothing will happen but I enjoy the doom porn. After the 23rd there will be another near date. Then another. Then another. Until you die of old age.

       Don't listen to dates, dates can be wrong and in my opinion are put there to discredit the notion our planet is periodically fucked up by celestial events. If everyone cries wolf all the time people stop believing it. But the wolves are there, regardless of what people believe.

       I have psychic abilities and I further researched them . What I do know is this is the year the government will establish full capabilities of their mind control programs and aswell as their weather machines . No doomsday revelations have came true up to this point obviously . But as crazy as it sounds ; I am going off all the information of classified documents I have read and linked together.

       haha, I agree. Years ago I touched base on it a little - but that was due to some of the 2012 stuff being said - which came and passed - unless it didn't, and the whole reality is a much stranger thing than we think - which, I'm down with .... I see some shit every day that boggles my mind at times haha.
      </p>
      <p>
       I bet there is a great thread linking all this stuff together on some corner of the internet - like the ancients talking and writing of this stuff, plus the signs they spoke of, plus modern proof ... I'm into the whole Nibiru thing ... not sure why scientists would announce it, and then "take it back". I feel some of this stuff is just too coincidental.
      </p>
      <p>
       Have anything interesting for me to read in regards to this thread topic?!
      </p>
      <p>
       Thanks for the good chats. I love a good chat back and forth, regardless of the view you may hold ... I feel thats what this place should be for. We could probably figure out a whole bunch more if we didn't spend the time here saying one another is stupid for believing one thing over another ... as most things are possible, and all of the 2nd hand info is just that ... it's just obvious you'll find more proof if they're writing the proof to fit the lie.

       Thank you. I needed to hear that. I have the utmost love for our Lord &amp; Savior, the utmost trust and faith in Him. Whatever plan he has laid out for me, good or bad, I will follow and embrace. I just want to go home.
