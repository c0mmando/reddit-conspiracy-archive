        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I think this was a heavy reach especially after what Carly Fiorina said about cryptocurrency on a technological politics aside level. The statements he made were simply ridiculous. </p>

<p>1) How his daughter bought bitcoin, made &quot;some&quot; money and thinks she&#39;s a genius. </p>

<p>2) Compares it to the tulip craze of the 1700&#39;s, a plant that grows and grows and grows while bitcoin is capped @ 21 million.</p>

<p>3) JP Morgan employers who trade cryptocurrency are going against the company policy and that they are stupid. </p>

<p>Remember... name calling is the lowest of the low when it comes to supporting your statement in an argument. </p>

<p>I think this was ALL purposely made public to drop the value (which didn&#39;t really hurt it other than give those who buy regularly a discount)</p>

<p>Your thoughts?</p>

They said mainly, there have only been three reserve currencies in the history of the western world,
    Franc, GBP, USD. </p>
