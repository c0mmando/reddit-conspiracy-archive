        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>It started with the obvious Confederate statues. Less divisive, easier to get people on board the statue removal boat. While I don&#39;t think we should be in favor of covering up any history, yeah maybe we shouldn&#39;t have statues of leaders who fought for slavery. Solid arguments on both sides. These statues were simply setting the stage, and putting this whole &quot;statues&quot; craze into the media. </p>

<p>Break 2 weeks for hurricanes and whatnot, not a mention of statues.... Now back to your regularly scheduled programming. </p>

<p>They&#39;ve set their sights on statues of Thomas Jefferson. You know, this Thomas Jefferson. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;There is nothing I would not sacrifice to a practicable plan of abolishing every vestige of this moral and political depravity [slavery]&quot; </p>
</blockquote>

<p>This will draw a much bigger response from people who wouldn&#39;t have said anything about the previous (confederate) statues. These people may even be so inclined to join the counter rally to stop the shrouding/destruction of the statue of one of our founding fathers. </p>

<p>Large rally, filled with normal people (lots of them). Add agitators on both sides and you&#39;ve got a civil war goin baby. </p>

<p>If the goal isn&#39;t to cause a violent conflict, you could also just have all the so-called normal people group up, sprinkle in a few Nazi&#39;s (or point to the few that will inevitably be there) and label everyone Nazi&#39;s. Either way it doesn&#39;t look good.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a reason this statue nonsense is in the media all of a sudden. They are using it to divide the country. Do not fall for it. </p>

<p>Edit w/ Link to statue shrouding: <a href="http://www.richmond.com/news/virginia/charlottesville-protesters-shroud-jefferson-statue-at-uva-s-rotunda-decry/article_7f15d988-cab3-5121-903f-8cf1f1c59952.html">http://www.richmond.com/news/virginia/charlottesville-protesters-shroud-jefferson-statue-at-uva-s-rotunda-decry/article_7f15d988-cab3-5121-903f-8cf1f1c59952.html</a></p>

<p>Apparently the university has since removed the shroud, I was unaware of this but good, hopefully nothing comes of this. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;5. Sidetrack opponents with name calling and ridicule. This is also known as the primary attack the messenger ploy, though other methods qualify as variants of that approach. Associate opponents with unpopular titles such as “kooks”, “right-wing”, “liberal”, “left-wing”, “terrorists”, “conspiracy buffs”, “radicals”, “militia”, “racists”, “religious fanatics”, “sexual deviates”, and so forth. This makes others shrink from support out of fear of gaining the same label, and you avoid dealing with issues.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If the racist Nazi hadn&#39;t mowed people down in a car an entite swath of the population wouldn&#39;t be concerned about the statues. That doesn&#39;t mean that that violence shining a light on the statues for the entire country to see is somehow a bad thing. Of course the fucking statues should come down. The little girl who helped integrate public schools in the South in the 1960s is only 63 years old. The stain of racism and hatred is that far removed. Most of these statues were put away decades after the Civil War and into the early 1900s. Some even the 1930s.</p>

<p>When you succeed from the United States in order to keep black people slaves and you then fight to destroy the United States and you lose, you don&#39;t get to have statues. Maybe in racist 1930s with the KKK marching on Washington but not 2017. When you assassinate one of the greatest United States presidents to ever hold office—Abraham Lincoln—then you don&#39;t deserve a fucking statue.</p>

<p>No black person alive today should have to walk by statues of individuals who tried to rip the United States apart and keep their black ancestors enslaved.</p>

<p>There&#39;s no argument that isn&#39;t utter bullshit. Confederate history IS NOT AMERICAN HISTORY. You don&#39;t get to abandon your country and then attack it in order to keep blacks enslaved and then expect statues to be erected in that very same country you abandoned to honor your betrayal and bigotry.</p>

<p>Lincoln and the Union treated former Confederates soldiers with respect and honor to help unite the country after the war. 2017 isn&#39;t the 1800s.</p>

<p>&quot;5. Sidetrack opponents with name calling and ridicule. This is also known as the primary attack the messenger ploy, though other methods qualify as variants of that approach. Associate opponents with unpopular titles such as “kooks”, “right-wing”, “liberal”, “left-wing”, “terrorists”, “conspiracy buffs”, “radicals”, “militia”, “racists”, “religious fanatics”, “sexual deviates”, and so forth. This makes others shrink from support out of fear of gaining the same label, and you avoid dealing with issues.&quot;</p>
