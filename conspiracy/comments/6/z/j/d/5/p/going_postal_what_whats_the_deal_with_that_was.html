    <div class="md"><p>Consider it was at a time when the U.S. Postal System and the employees were under attack from the anti-government conservatives 
Conservatives with a goal of privatizing the U.S. Postal Service.  </p>

<p>They did manage to make it a quasi separate operation, yet choked by only allowing Congress to approve rate increases and did very successfully break the Postal workers union where there are now new low paid employed and older better paid retiring employees and the is a current plan with a few attempts at deployment to steal tha massive forced by congressional act pension funding that cripples the Postal Service&#39;s ability to function and leaves them open to privatization and those pension funds will be stolen.</p>

<p>I am referring to the Congressional Mandate that the Post Office fund their pension and health care funds an a rate not required by any other entity, from the W. Bush years. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I didn&#39;t suggest a minimum wage of $20/hr.  I said $15 too $20 per hr. is not, &quot;well paid.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Big leap, I don&#39;t think anyone said they loved the wealthiest few. $15-20 outside of a city isn&#39;t terrible, as a starting wage it&#39;s good. I live in a city where u need to make 22 to survive and minimum is 11, if your somewhere with low living costs 15-20 is all that is needed for a single person, families need more tho. I agree it&#39;s sad that we&#39;ve come to expect the minimum for a quality life to be &quot;well paid&quot;.</p>

I do remember being a child and watching the man who delivered our mail and who had been a postman for all his life, literally fall apart and retire early the, pushing included supervisors following the postmen around on their routes and increasing workloads,  though I probably mostly remember it because my parents discussed it during dinner.</p>
