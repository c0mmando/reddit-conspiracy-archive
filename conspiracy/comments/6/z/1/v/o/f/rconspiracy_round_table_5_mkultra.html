    <div class="md"><p>‎Jon Ronson‎ was recently on Joe Rogan Experience.  He basically says the whole program was a joke and Major Gerneral Albert Stubblebine was out of his mind.  Although, I though the most interesting aspect of the interview was when he talked about how infiltrated neo nazi/white supremacist groups are with FBI agents.  I&#39;ve been making that point for a while not, and currently feel the feds are helping to create the current political environment for social manipulation by using higalian dialect.</p>

<p>I try to point how prevalent FBI informants are, they pop up all the time.  I really need to sit down one day and make a  u/-moose- type post about FBI informants, because they are everywhere.</p>

<p>Jonestown was certainly a mkultra experiment.
<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown_conspiracy_theories">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown_conspiracy_theories</a></p>

<p>Many people forget how close Jim Jones was with politicians. In fact, he was appointed chairman of San Francisco Housing Authority, where he recruited many of his future victims. From <a href="http://jonestown.sdsu.edu/?page_id=33190">http://jonestown.sdsu.edu/?page_id=33190</a></p>

<p><em>One of his notable honors was being selected chairman of the San Francisco Housing Authority Commission by San Francisco Mayor George Moscone (Layton, 105). The Mayor was one of his greatest supporters, even sponsoring a Testimonial Dinner in the reverend’s honor (Layton, 105). On one occasion, Jones hosted a celebration for Martin Luther King Jr.’ s Birthday and shared the podium with Governor Brown and the Chief of President Carter’s Transition Team (Layton, 105). When Ronald Reagan was the governor of California, he sent the Temple a thank-you note to the Temple for all of their hard work in the community (Layton, 35). His most noteworthy advocates include President Carter’s wife, civil rights leader Angela Davis, Pastor Cecil Williams, and Indian rights activist Dennis Banks (Layton, 65). With such an entourage, it is easy to see why Jones had success Despite his outlandish doctrine and often erratic behavior.</em></p>

<p>It&#39;s a fun site to hypothesize about, sure, mostly because it looks so damn creepy. But guess what? All the SAGE bases looked creepy, and a lot of them left better paper trails of exactly how and why they were.</p>

<p>He doesn&#39;t have any drugs or confinement or shock treatments or McGill U extremities. They were more along the lines of Milgram experiments or Stanford Prison experiments. Basically grad students would be assholes to the subjects and study how they reacted. The Harvard students got off pretty light in comparison. Not that they weren&#39;t in outrageous violation of modern human experiments protocol, but Kaczynski&#39;s twisted psyche was affected by a million other circumstances beyond CIA experimentation.  </p>

<p>i share your concern. one example which immediately springs to mind concerns a riff on <a href="https://www.huxley.net/bnw-revisited/">this</a> quote:</p>

<p>&quot;In the Brave New World of my fantasy eugenics and dysgenics were practiced systematically.&quot;</p>

<p>i vividly recall jan exclaiming that the phrase &quot;fantasy eugenics&quot; proves that huxley was an idealistic eugenicist technocrat of the worst sort, while it is quite obvious from attention to context that &quot;fantasy&quot; in this context refers to the book itself. i&#39;ve thought of pointing this out to him, but my last conversation with him ended badly (though humorously), with me confessing that i was part of the cia mind control squad assigned to stop his liberatory mission by asking him reasonable questions.</p>

So, imaging of the brain, ultrasound of the heart and the blood vessels in the neck and the brain, extensive blood tests. Evaluated by a cardiologist, as well as migraine specialists and neurosurgeon. No stone was left unturned and luckily, (they&#39;re) 95 percent sure it was not a stroke.

    <div class="md"><p>True. What gets me about the clips of news personalities &#39;breaking down&quot; like this is that these people spend an enormous amount of time speaking in front of a camera, and of course they&#39;re going to fuck up now and again.</p>

<p>Some are stranger than others, no question, but framing every brief pause as an mk ultra glitch seems a bit of a stretch.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Many of the points made in the Greenbaum speech re: color coding, Greek letters, etc seem hard to believe, but they emerged as a collection of memes emerging from private psychiatrists and psychologists comparing notes. There&#39;s one scholarly reference that puts the population so &#39;coded&#39; at around 1.3k. This is where the False Memory Syndrome Foundation finds its way onto the scene in the early 90s.</p>

<p>Gunther Russbacher supposedly corroborated this, but fortunately there&#39;s enough evidence for it now that we don&#39;t have to take his word. I don&#39;t believe any of the circumstances surrounding Russbacher &amp; Paul Wilcher have ever been proven out one way or another to a meaningful degree, tho.</p>

<p>It seems that he is now focused on neurofeedback. Not a word is mentioned about MPD, ritual abuse or programming. Was kind of expecting more...looks like he just straight up abondened all that stuff?

    <div class="md"><p>To say nothing of US state policies and practices prior to WW2, it&#39;s almost like our keepers learned of Nazi and Imperial Japanese human experimentation and occult/phenomena research and said &quot;well hey that&#39;s a great idea.&quot; And soon thereafter &quot;well hey the Soviets are doing it to too, we gotta keep up.&quot; I&#39;ve done my digging and been disgusted by what I&#39;ve found. As this may be the most confirmable and devious 20th century conspiracy by the US government against it&#39;s people (in the usual guise of being conducted &quot;for&quot; the people), it&#39;s still quite relevant. I have some questions for those more knowledgeable than I. </p>

<p>Were systems like this already in play in the US long before WW2? Aside from Eugenics I mean, though it&#39;s clearly a precursor of sorts.  </p>

<p>I&#39;ve read pieces on E.T. disclosure in which former state officials coming forward to claim and hint-hint about Roswell and other events are viewed with extreme skepticism...largely around how much should we really be trusting former state officials to tell us the truth about anything? Are we being misled on purpose? Too good to be true? </p>

<p>Branching off of that idea, were the official end of the program and the release of declassified docs about it a &quot;too good to be true&quot; kind of thing? Perhaps that out of concern for the public finding out about the program the state then disclosed part of it, punished some of it&#39;s players, thereby informing the public of what occurred but also indirectly insuring us that it no longer continues. Many sources I&#39;ve seen claim that it was a small, niche program only known to a few select agencies and players...was this really the case, or simply an attempt to reduce the public scope the program itself?</p>

<p>Is there any doubt that MKULTRA-style interrogation techniques aren&#39;t still being tested and perhaps utilized at CIA black sites? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My reaction is exactly the same. We might be at the same level of research, I&#39;m not sure, so consider these for thought rather than as authoritative, they&#39;re all &quot;as far as I know.&quot;</p>

<p>Truman created the what is now the CIA in 1947. The agency is the secret police at the will of the president. I believe that it works the other way around as well, in the Deep State uses CIA to find and use blackmail techniques specifically against the president. Gottlieb et al created blackmail child pornography films of government and university employees using MKULTRA child sex slaves. </p>

<p>Let me repeat that because it blows my mind that this is not the only thing we talk and DO something about: Gottlieb et al created blackmail child pornography films of government and university employees using MKULTRA child sex slaves. </p>

<p>CIA must have known about ancient ritualistic torture techniques to control the human mind. They definitely started the slave program before learning of the &quot;Manchurian Candidate,&quot; which they claimed was their motivation.</p>

<p>They pardoned the German mind control and the Japanese biowarfare/radiation scientists. </p>

<p>The Mengele import was the most obvious and not even acknowledged by the 1996 Presidential Commission that I could see. They could not admit that they were bringing Mengele over so they concocted &quot;German countryside&quot; and &quot;Argentina&quot; b.s. EVEN ISRAEL helped Mengele keep his Canadian and American torture/mind control position of &quot;Dr. Green&quot; (&quot;Green&quot; is the head programmer.) They claimed to have found Mengele but let him go in order not to endanger another NAZI hunt underway, which is the biggest pile of ridiculous nonsense ever uttered.</p>

<p>Mengele worked in Canada and bases all over the United States. His work or perhaps his colleague&#39;s work I&#39;m not sure (because sometimes I just have to stop reading) was based on ancient and satanic ritual abuse mind control methods which allowed CIA to organize and create mind control recipes.</p>

<p>CIA might have been innocent compared to the German and Japanese mind control but my opinion was that they would have done it if they had thought of it, so rather than &quot;that&#39;s a great idea let&#39;s steal their work after the war,&quot; it was &quot;our Deep State masters are multi-generational satanic ritual abuse mind control slave societies already, let&#39;s up our game against/with them by using the advanced German and Japanese techniques. I base this belief on the fact that they didn&#39;t just steal the &quot;losers&#39;&quot; work, they pardoned, rewarded and his the criminals from retribution. Today the world thinks Neuremburg took care of the NAZI doctors and doesn&#39;t even know about the Japanese cooking people alive.</p>

<p>Eugenics - I think you are absolutely right in stating that Eugenics was in place, because Eugenics is a natural precursor to multi generation mind control slavery. I also came to that conclusion. I think Rockfeller Eugenics, NAZI eugencis and Harry Armstrong making sure the NAZI mind control scientists were setup in cushy CIA university jobs are all intimately connected.</p>

<p>Re ET in my opinion all ET info is a cover story for two disinfo campaigns. </p>

<p>One, ET is used as part of mind control domination, it is a being so powerful that the slave believes he/she is being watched on an atomic level and can therefore not break the terror to escape.</p>

<p>Two I think came later but that&#39;s just a guess is to use ET as the biggest false flag ever created in order to justify spending trillions to defend earth from the greatest danger it ever faced. </p>

<p>William Cooper said that he was leaked ET info in order to disseminate intact but later realized that it was leaked to him so that he would be an unwitting disinformation agent.</p>

<p>The documents were not released on purpose. They were stolen and at first the newspapers refused to print them. But they did, hence the Church Committee hearings. Helms ordered all of the MKULTRA documentation burned. The only reason FOIA has anything is because there was a box mis-filed and so handed over (which blows my mind because it would imply there&#39;s an honest person complying with FOIA in CIA when we know they accidentally lose Apollo Mission and Torture documentation on a regular basis).</p>

<p>Stansfield Turner only exposed and admitted to what was already exposed on stolen paper, which is why LSD and not sex, torture and slavery were not exposed. The senators were remarkably kind to him and he was remarkably kind to the universities that received the MKULTRA contracts. They asked him softball questions, and he in turn wrote to universities giving them a heads up that some information on them was public so hint hint wink wink might wanna destroy some records.</p>

<p>Most of the FOIA material was financial and so didn&#39;t expose the agency to any trouble. NONE of the people involved in LSD or sex slave/assassin/secret courier were sought out or put on trial.</p>

<p>No one was brought to trial, no one was punished. Gottlieb wrote a memo he made sure was public saying that CIA had given up on mind control because it didn&#39;t work. This was 100% lie. Not only did mind control work, by 1973 the electronic frequency weapons used on people this very day were already well under way. </p>

<p>The MKULTRA program is the name I will continue to call it because we are communicating a concept, not being pendantic about secret code words and &quot;it depends on the meaning of &#39;is.&#39;&quot; </p>

<p>Semantics are irrelevant when children are being raped and tortured in order to ensure my freedom as an American. </p>

<p>YES it absolutely still goes on today. Targeted Individuals are being microwaved and bombarded with EEG cloning attacks that create forced speech, voices in their brains not produced by soundwaves a recorder can interpret, remote influencing, mind reading (I am not joking).</p>

<p>Its counterpart is gangstalking, which uses the community to torture, harass and gaslight the victim in order to destabilize what&#39;s left of their sanity. </p>

<p>The microwave and remote electronic brainwave weaponry is the MKULTRA mind control program, and the gangstalking is part of the victim surveillance and destablization.</p>

<p>The MKULTRA weapons mimic psychiatric illnesses of schizophrenia and paranoia. Victims appear to have these disorders because they hear voices. The gangstalking and harassment require sensitization to the perpetrators&#39; clothing or car colors and so to an onlooker there is nothing there when the victim complains of being stalked. But the victim recognizes the patterns and so can&#39;t understand why no one else can see them. That is the nature of sensitization. Buy a red car and suddenly you will see red cars all over the place. They were always there but now you&#39;re conscious of the color. </p>

<p>The weapons induce psychiatric disorders and the gangstalking, harassment, gaslighting and surveillance create valid paranoia. Combined these make the victim appear to someone who knows nothing of these programs as if they are a paranoid schizophrenic delusional person who is therefore completely discredited. Because victims have no credibility, MKULTRA is now a worldwide program of victims being microwaved, having images induced into their minds, having thoghts programmed into their mind, having voices pumped into their cochlear center that interprets noise signals into speech. They are harassed with voices and text messages telling them what they are doing at the very moment they are receiving the message, ensuring they know that the MKULTRA perps have complete control of their lives. The perpetrators say things like &quot;We are going to rape and kill you,&quot; and &quot;You should kill yourself.&quot;</p>

<p>In this way they destroy the victim, they decompose the life force in a modern process of what the E. German government of 1950-1989 called Zersetzung, or &quot;decomposition.&quot; </p>

<p>Mind reading sounds fantastical until you realise that your little voice in your head (subvocalisation) actually creates movement in the larynx. All you&#39;d need is a powerful camera and a program which can decipher said movements. SVR (Subvocal recognition) is a real phenomenon, being studied around the world right now. It&#39;s no leap to suggest that there&#39;s a way to do it without placing electrodes on the larynx. It&#39;s no secret. Check out US patents even: 6011991 and 3951134.</p>

<p>the release of declassified docs</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Speaking from experience, having worked on three DoD classified programs (now declassified), typically, the only reasons any government agency releases declassified documents are:</p>

<p>a.)  the document&#39;s contents is no longer relevant. *</p>

<p>b.) the document&#39;s contents have been eclipsed by later developments. 
c.) persons involved in the document are no longer living.</p>

<p>I support this suggestion. However I&#39;m more interested on discussing the modern devices and artifacts used for a effective brainwashing. Lets be coherent, these days it&#39;s difficult to provide LSD or other substances and perform a psychological &quot;montage&quot; like MKULTRA did to disrupt the victim, but technologies like military V2K (exploiting the microwave auditory effect: voices in ones mind) and other remote directed energy weapons designed to harm (ultra/infra sonic and microwaves) can disrupt a victim to the point of making a remote (re)programming possible, even guiding a harmless person to commit one or more &quot;convenient&quot; crimes.</p>

<p>that, and the fact the every info on it gets aggressively taken down, in a so precise and organized manner that only people with alot of power are capable of.</p>

<p>plus, it&#39;s not the first time a pizza place has been used as child prostitution hideout. &quot;jojo&#39;s pizza&quot;.</p>

<p>also, it&#39;s not the first time that hillary and bill clinton or their close friends the podesta brothers have been tied to child prostitution rings and sex offenders.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Dr. Donald Ewen Cameron (24 December 1901 – 8 September 1967) — was a Scottish-born psychiatrist who served as President of the American Psychiatric Association (1952–1953), Canadian Psychiatric Association (1958-1959), American Psychopathological Association (1963), Society of Biological Psychiatry (1965) and World Psychiatric Association (1961-1966). Notwithstanding his high professional reputation, he has been criticized for administering electroshock therapy and experimental drugs to patients without their informed consent. Some of this work took place in the context of the Project MKUltra mind control program.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Has there ever been any material declassified or leaked about the Soviet or Chinese equivalents of MKULTRA and the wider patronage of 60s counterculture by the CIA? Considering how much more &quot;blatant&quot; their totalitarian regimes during the era were it seems surprising that neither of those two countries ever made any attempt to engineer a new type of culture for the latter half of the 20th century. Which is strange considering they both had access to more or less the same resources as the US on that front and that they <em>did</em> compete with the US in much more resource-intensive fields of R&amp;D like nuclear and ballistic missile programs. Counterculture, helped the US gain enormous influence over non-aligned nations and left communism fighting an uphill battle around the globe. Why didn&#39;t the communists attempt to artificially manipulate their culture and reinvent themselves into something that would be more popular? Or did they do that and it just didn&#39;t work?  </p>

<p>Closest that I know of is the Maoist cultural revolution and destalinization but those were both blunt political initiatives carried out in public.</p>

<p>Back when CNN did actual journalism: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8eYZIwVHg">CNN Special Report 1985 Electromagnetic Frequency Technology</a> [13:26]</p>

<p>It discusses Soviet and American technology. Note, this was in 1985, so the methods have certainly become more powerful and fine tuned. </p>

<p>This thread has some Nazi and Japanese experiments. Very sick stuff: <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6z4ewn/conspiracy_facts_a_brief_history_of_human/">Conspiracy facts: A brief history of human experimentation without consent.</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Its worth mentioning that there need not be a &#39;one single program&#39; that all mind controll is controlled by. Many independent programs, cults, and buisinesses can deploy methods of controll... So if you have a music icon with a lot of people making money off them, it seems plausible that producers may want some controll over these artists as a sort of insurance.  So there&#39;s that to keep in mind.  That said i have very little doubt that programming of this sort is used in the music and media industry.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Recommended reading in regards to MKUltra (or just the government in general) experimenting on children: <a href="http://truth-out.org/archive/component/k2/item/91211:the-hidden-tragedy-of-the-cias-experiments-on-children">http://truth-out.org/archive/component/k2/item/91211:the-hidden-tragedy-of-the-cias-experiments-on-children</a></p>

<p>Some &quot;highlights&quot;:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>From early <strong>1940 to 1953, Dr. Lauretta Bender, a highly respected child neuropsychiatrist practicing at Bellevue Hospital in New York City, experimented extensively with electroshock therapy on children who had been diagnosed with &quot;autistic schizophrenia.&quot; In all, it has been reported that Bender administered electroconvulsive therapy to at least 100 children ranging in age from three years old to 12 years, with some reports indicating the total may be twice that number. One source reports that, inclusive of Bender&#39;s work, electroconvulsive treatment was used on more than 500 children at Bellevue Hospital from 1942 to 1956</strong>, and then at Creedmoor State Hospital Children&#39;s Service from 1956 to 1969. Bender was a confident and dogmatic woman, who bristled at criticism, oftentimes refused to acknowledge reality even when it stood starkly before her.</p>

<p><strong>One six-year-old boy, after being shocked several times, went from being a shy, withdrawn child to acting increasingly aggressive and violent. Another child, a seven-year-old girl, following five electroshock sessions had become nearly catatonic.</strong></p>

<p>Years later, <strong>another of Bender&#39;s young patients who became overly aggressive after about 20 treatments, now grown, was convicted in court as a &quot;multiple murderer.&quot;</strong> (<em>before the word &quot;serial killer&quot; existed.. almost makes you think they were created</em> OP&#39;s thoughts) Others, in adulthood, reportedly were in and of trouble and prison for a battery of petty and violent crimes. <strong>A 1954 scientific study of about 50 of Bender&#39;s young electroshock patients, conducted by two psychologists, found that nearly all were worse off after the &quot;therapy&quot; and that some had become suicidal after treatment.</strong> One of the children studied in 1954 was the son of well-known writer Jacqueline Susann, author of the bestselling novel &quot;Valley of the Dolls.&quot; Susann&#39;s son, Guy, was diagnosed with autism shortly after birth and, when he was three years old, Dr. Bender convinced Susann and her husband that Guy could be successfully treated with electroshock therapy. Guy returned home from Bender&#39;s care a nearly lifeless child. Susann later told people that Bender had &quot;destroyed&quot; her son. </p>

<p>About the same time Dr. Bender was conducting her electroshock experiments, <strong>she was also widely experimenting on autistic and schizophrenic children with what she termed other &quot;treatment endeavors.&quot; These included use of a wide array of psycho-pharmaceutical agents</strong>, several provided to her by the Sandoz Chemical Co. in Basel, Switzerland, as well as Metrazol, sub-shock insulin therapy, amphetamines and anticonvulsants... <strong>a public mental facility, reveal that Metrazol was administered to them by CIA contractor Dr. Robert Hyde on numerous occasions in order &quot;to address overly aggressive behavior.&quot;</strong></p>

<p>In 1955 and1956, *<em>Dr. Bender began hearing glowing accounts about the potential of LSD for producing remarkable results in children suffering mental disorders, including autism and schizophrenia. Bender&#39;s earlier work with electroshock therapy had brought her into contact with several other prominent physicians who, at the time, were covert contractors with the CIA&#39;s MK/ULTRA and Artichoke projects. *</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is sooo much more, including this chilling personal story:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;During the 10 sessions, each of which involved an injection, my sister and I were kept in separate bedrooms, darkened rooms, usually with someone present in the room, but I don&#39;t know who the person was. Occasionally, my mother was also present. At times, I was so frightened by the hallucinations that I screamed and tried to escape from the room. I remember once actually reaching the hallway and being forcibly put back into the bedroom by my mother. I saw a wild array of images - nightmarish visions, occasionally provoking hysterical laughter, followed immediately by wracking sobs. I had no idea what was happening to me. It was terrifying....</p>

<p>&quot;Although each individual session was often terrifying, any lasting effects of the LSD unfolded gradually. In the weeks immediately following the final session, I experienced frequent nightmares - visions of crawling insects, horrible masks, etc. I couldn&#39;t sleep. I was afraid to shut my eyes. I became afraid of the dark. My parents were dismissive and unsympathetic. Their attitude was, in some ways, more disturbing to me than the experiments themselves because it meant that my parents had known full well that the experience would very likely be frightening - and hadn&#39;t cared.</p>

<p>&quot;Two years after these experiments, during her freshman year in college, my sister suffered a nervous breakdown. I don&#39;t know the extent to which the LSD may have precipitated this. But my parents&#39; response to what was probably a mild breakdown from which my sister could have recovered, was coercive and drastic. She had been asking questions about the LSD at this time. She was angry about it. We both were. We talked about it together, but I was afraid to confront our parents. My sister was not. The angrier she became, the more she was &#39;diagnosed&#39; as a &#39;psychiatric&#39; case and the more medication she was given. To this day, my sister is heavily medicated. She never fully recovered from that first episode.</p>

<p>&quot;Our parents responded to my sister&#39;s anger in a way that frightened me further. I also felt tremendous guilt for not being able to prevent the horrors that my sister endured. Once she was &#39;classified&#39; as a psychiatric patient, she was lost. Everything that was done to her in the name of &#39;treatment&#39; seemed to me to be a form of ongoing abuse and torture.</p>

<p>&quot;<strong>The fact that our father was a prominent, internationally known and widely respected physician - and his brother, who had introduced us to this LSD horror, was a prominent, internationally known and widely respected psychiatrist - made it impossible to expose them or go against them. Their reputations were more important to them than the health and well being of my sister.</strong></p>

<p>&quot;Even when I subsequently confronted my father with the evidence that LSD had been tested by the CIA for use as a military weapon in the 1950s and 1960s, he dismissed his participation by saying that it was an &#39;enlightening experience, like visiting an art gallery.&#39; When I pointed out that this was not my experience as a child, he dismissed it, including the presumption that I must be a &#39;conspiracy theorist&#39; to propose such a thing. At the age of 91, he finally admitted that it had perhaps not been a very good idea to subject my sister and me to LSD.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In 1960, Abramson conducted his own LSD experiments on a group of six children ranging in age from five to 14 years of age. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Further experiments:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Her initial <strong>group of young subjects consisted of 14 children diagnosed schizophrenic, all under the age of 11.</strong> (Because diagnostic criteria for schizophrenia, autism, and other disorders have changed over the decades, one cannot assess what actual conditions these children really had.) There were 11 boys and three girls, ranging in age from six to ten years old.</p>

<p>Jean Marie is <strong>almost seven years old.</strong> She came here nearly a year ago after her parents abandoned her to the care of an aunt who had no interest in raising her. Marie, who prefers to be called Jean, is shy, withdrawn, and distrustful of most adults she encounters. There are reports she may have been sexually molested by her uncle ... Despite her withdrawn nature she smiles easily, and enjoys the company of other children. After receiving LSD on three occasions earlier this month, <strong>Marie ceased smiling at all and lost any interest in others her age</strong> ... In the past week, she seems to have become easily agitated and has lost any interest in reading, something she seemed to very much enjoy before treatment.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, as a mere <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> mod, I can only approve your comment and let you know about your predicament. </p>

<p>I recommend you contact the reddit admins ASAP about the status of your account.</p>

<p>That being said, I would&#39;ve been a <em>tad</em> disappointed if there were no shadowbanned users in an MKULTRA megathread :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Mind control is spiritually based in that demons are instilled into a person during trauma and then called forth to take over that person&#39;s consciousness and make them perform as required. In the Bible, in Acts 16, the apostles encounter a woman whom we could say fits this description. &quot;And it came to pass, as we went to prayer, a certain damsel possessed with a spirit of divination met us, which brought her masters much gain by soothsaying: the same followed Paul and us, and cried, saying, These men are the servants of the most high God, which shew unto us the way of salvation. And this did she many days. But Paul, being grieved, turned and said to the spirit, I command thee in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her. And he came out the same hour.&quot; (Acts 16:16-18) </p>

<p>Although the demon in this case gave the skill of divination, demons have been rumored to give other skills, for example: musical instrument performance, physical strength, telepathy, remote viewing, intelligence, foreign language fluency, and &quot;photographic memory&quot;. When reading about famous people, many will speak multiple languages at a young age or have photographic memories. Robert Johnson was just one of a great many musicians rumored to have sold his soul for musical talent. Svali, who claimed to be an Illuminati defector, said that her fluency in multiple languages stopped when she placed faith in God&#39;s only son, Jesus Christ.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And if you talk about it, people will say that the project was a &#39;failure&#39; and research was abandoned because that&#39;s what the CIA and gov officials told them.</p>

<p>Did they really expect for the CIA and gov to come out and say, &quot;hey guys we were successful with our mind control experiments!&quot;. </p>

<p>Did they really think that they would stop the pursuit of achieving mind control? It is like the ultimate weapon. </p>

<p>Organized religion is the original mind control. How else can you get someone to be willing to kill themselves and others in the name of an invisible all mighty being for favors in the afterlife. Of course there is something in the human mind that allows it to be exploited and controlled.  </p>

<p>I have authored &#39;Deprogramming Modalities for Trauma Mind Control Survivors&#39; which is completely original work in detecting and undoing this MKULTRA mind control.</p>

<p>I was tempted to try ask to do an AMA on here, however I am unsure if it&#39;s safe enough - as in, wont get downvoted to oblivion then deleted for an obscure reason.</p>

<p>Feel free to AMA here, I have already have done some basic Q and A on Reddit, which you can see in my updates on the site.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am originally from Australia. There also isn&#39;t any &#39;recently&#39; MKULTRA&#39;d persons. Sure there are some lighter things they can do, however the genuine trauma mind control the MKULTRA project was about - the person needs to be less then six years of age for the personality to split properly, as the ego isn&#39;t solidified before that age.</p>

<p>I believe anyone who says they had a normal life then all of a sudden were &#39;MKULTRA&#39;d&#39; when they were older are either two things. Making it up, or they have being programmed since childhood. It is one or the other and never inbetween.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting question!</p>

<p>I&#39;d have to say no.</p>

<p>In any case hypnosis would be the basis of reducing a persons mind to regress like that, regardless of what trauma or drugs are involved, age regression is achieved by hypnotic suggestion regardless.</p>

<p>Six years old is the age where a childs&#39; ego starts to solidify for lack of a better word. After this it becomes very hard to split the personality due to the mind being used to the single personality. Also before the age of six years, this is when the child takes in the most information learning wise about their surroundings.</p>

<p>So for a non programmed person it is hard to split any personalities even with age regression, drugs and trauma due to the ego being already solidified. So to make it short, hypnotic suggestion cannot &#39;undo&#39; this ego state to be broken.</p>

<p>Needless to say it is still possible for accessors, or any of these cults who have this access to mind control to still use non programmed persons in a way where they are unaware. This is generally done through intelligence agencies as the front.</p>

<p>Obviously if this is the case, then it will be extremely low level related activities, meaning &#39;non hierarchy&#39; - compared to persons programmed from birth successfully generally have &#39;hierarchy&#39; programming and therefor considered less disposable.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m going to be harsh here, but this is my honest opinion. Your wiki features disinformation, non-credible cases, and highly triggering material. No, you cannot magically deprogram yourself over a short time period or with special codes. Your writing is near incomprehensible in places. You aren&#39;t doing anyone, least of all survivors, any favors. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is alright, in fact I welcome this kind of criticism as it allows me to clear up a few points.</p>

<p>Please inform me of which is disinformation? And also of which cases are non credible? Even Svali and Fritz Springemeier have personally commented to myself that the wiki is a very good resource, with Fritz commenting that this is &quot;progress&quot; and a &quot;badly needed resource&quot;.</p>

<p>If you have no idea who these two people are then I suggest you stop typing.</p>

<p>If you read at the very top of the Wiki page, and also throughout there is a heavy warning regarding triggering content. This is very obvious and given the fact that we are dealing with this, how can one 100% avoid triggering content?</p>

<p>The Deprogram Wiki is for everyone. Survivors, therapists and curious persons who wish to learn more.</p>

<p>There is no way to magically deprogram onesself over a short time. You are right. If you actually read my material properly I already say this. It takes several years, and the approach I have is without the use of any codes.</p>

<p>Given the fact that I have received excellent feedback with personal feedback from survivors themselves thanking me for my work. Also the fact that I am a survivor, I find your last statement somewhat insulting.</p>

<p>For example here is some feedback I have just received. &quot;I found the &quot;How Programming can Influence your Thoughts&quot; section most interesting and relevant.&quot;</p>

<p>If you would take the time to actually read the website properly, instead of glancing over it and formulating these speculative and false opinions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not saying everyone is doing this here but quite often I see people demonizing LSD when they bring up MKULTRA or claim that the entire counterculture movement of the 60s was because of MKULTRA which I think are two positions that obviously disingenuous to anyone who has actually done LSD, at least more than once or twice. Although they very well may have contributed to the culture of the 60s and introduced LSD to a lot of people who then introduced it to others I think if you look into historically you find that most of the people experimenting with LSD in the 50s were psychologists who bought LSD straight from Sandoz and then they introduced it to friends. Rick Doblin highlights this cultural movement among psychologists and psychiatrists in his many interviews and the fact they were doing this research at Universities and involving grad students creates the perfect atmosphere for a cultural spread of psychedelic culture that was the 1960s. </p>

<p>Obviously such powerful substances as LSD can be used to torture individuals or possibly induce psychic phenomena such as shared hallucinations but I keep seeing people blame MKULTRA when actresses in Hollywood have a breakdown or even attribute Marxism to LSD which I think is illogical and disingenuous. Most people have enlightening experiences when they try psychedelics and most psychedelic enthusiasts tend to be in support of individual freedom above all else. That&#39;s not to say that people havent lost their minds on LSD or it cant cause delusions and there is evidence that at least a few serial killers and murderers were part of the MKULTRA program including the infamous &quot;uni bomber.&quot; </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why do you say this?  So little seems to be known about the actual chronology of the mind control programs and their relation to one another.  I have often thought MKUltra was a limited hangout as well since so much was purposefully hidden.  I wonder if the story about the known records only surviving due to mis-categorization are true?  If they are then that would mean MKUltra is a limited hang out.</p>

<ul>
<li>In 1951 the CIA sprayed a French village with LSD to test LSD as a combat weaon on the battlefield.<br/></li>
</ul>

<p>Quote: &quot;It is August 1951 and an entire French village goes crazy. People are screaming in the streets and throwing themselves out of windows. 300 people are affected and 7 end up dead. 60 years later declassified documents from the United States reveal that the CIA conducted experiments on unsuspecting citizens.&quot; </p>

<p>You can watch the film for free with a free 30-day trial if you&#39;re not an Amazon Prime member.</p>

Anyway, I just want to say that this really is one of the best moderated subs I&#39;ve seen, especially for such a contraversial topic. Seriously, I haven&#39;t seen anyone banned just for disagreeing with a conspiracy, which is honestly not what I expected when I first came here. It&#39;s much more interesting to read about these things when you can see the counterarguments, instead of just a string of deleted comments. Even though I don&#39;t really believe in most of these, I&#39;m still a lot more persuaded than I would otherwise be. </p>

<p>Anyway, just thanks to the mod team for being cool. </p>

<p>i am trying to get the word out at more than a little risk to myself</p>

<p>the rainbow gathering in oregon was a complete police operation, hundreds of undercovers there on day 1 pretending to be campers.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think that so far at this point... and with the advance technology the Government has... we all are part of the MKUltra programming. In Fact, i think we are being programmed while we watch Game Of Thrones, The Superbowl, The Primetime news, Radial waves that our smart TVs, PCs and Smartphones transmit throughtout the air ... Subliminal Imagery and Sounds our unconsicious mind can easily catch without us ever knowing about it... Sound notes and words that trigger a certain emotion and reaction in our central-nervous-system. Certain ingredients mixed up in our cans of Pepsi or in our starbucks coffee. Classified components that not even Doctors are aware of... Chemicals that come from the mixing of plants and artificial substances made inside the ClA labs back in the 50&#39;s... Lots of money, wealth and power is put into this by the Elites of the world (Bilderberg Group)... and the only clue we have to it... it&#39;s the one left into the 90&#39;s card game &quot;Illuminati&quot;, someone who was inside the Elite or somehow got this information put it all away in a children&#39;s card game that nobody even ever played... with the hopes (or maybe because he felt sad about us) that we can have a little.... very very little... glimpse at our true reality. Just a tiny glimpse, a foolish and inmature glimps at our existance.</p>

<p>Gunther Russbacher supposedly corroborated this, but fortunately there&#39;s enough evidence for it now that we don&#39;t have to take his word.
