       I posted this in a comment on the other recent BMB post, but I think it deserves to be posted on its own considering many people have never heard about this.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just interested in hearing the communities take on this. Do you believe it? Or does anyone have a good potential theory of a conspiracy? This article does provoke some interesting questions.

       This was one of the most suspicious things about this event. Did you ever dive into the connected story about this guys friends that sold weed and were murdered in a "robbery" where they were found with their throats slashed and covered in weed and money? Super suspicious.

       I don't understand why people always ask this question. 'They' is and always has been representative of The Powers That be. You want names? Rothschild, Rockefeller, Carnegie, Westinghouse, DuPont, Mellon, etc. The people with all the money. It works in their best interest because evil is a strawman. We spend our time blaming the woes of the world on evil, when it is merely men with money.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are no dragons. There are no aliens. Everything we are taught we learn form someone else. Every article, every book we read, every movie we see, every news segment, every TV show, was essentially sponsored by 'Them'. If we believe they're evil, it's because they want us to. There's hardly a man among us who truly thinks independently. We are replicants. Slaves to paper and money- incapable of imaging freedom outside of travel. A freaking car has become the symbol of freedom...

       Please be less general, do you think that these two who could provide more information about the Boston bombers didn't die, do you think they never existed?

       I'd bet that what didn't happen was the Boston bombings and these two knew it so "they" want to make sure we don't realize it.

       I wish I could talk about it in a more direct way, but it's literally impossible. The conspiracy at hand is far too grand to convey to anyone in a passing conversation. That's why it works so well. It is literally the world around you- how can I convince people that that which they see and touch isn't real? They're looking right at it. They can smell and taste it. It's like me trying to convince you that colors aren't real.

       If you want to start talking about archons and the matrix then be plain about it.
       <br/>
       It's best not mentioning it, if you have no confidence others would take the time to listen since it only creates confusion for those who wouldn't believe it.

       Chaos and confusion are our friends. Go far enough through the mud and you end up in the ocean, cleaned.
      </p>
      <p>
       Archons and movies can't explain the position we find the world in. The Bible does a better job of it, but no one wants to hear it, read it, or even think about it, because they don't know what it is.
      </p>
      <p>
       The truth, my friend, is not something anyone wants to read. It's the last thing we want to read, literally. If you constantly only read what you want to hear (conspiracy theories) you'll never get any closer to the truth. They create conspiracy theories. It's how they feed the intelligent among us, but it is merely food, only good for satisfying short term curiosities.

       I think it depends on what you look for when you read a conspiracy theory, if it's all akin to a giant boardgame then watching the movement of a single piece allows you to infer the intentions of the player who moved it.
       <br/>
       Keep watching the pieces and you can get an idea of where the game is heading. As for movies, they are only easily used themes to describe something that I doubt I understand anything more than the movie maker; functional as a method of communication perhaps.
       <br/>
       I'm sure they do create strife to occupy us but we alone decide the content of our discussions. A conspiracy board can still remain so without falling prey to distractions, I personally feel frustrated when I see someone asking for all the "religious shit" to be removed however it is undeniable that the board is flooded on occasion by those not seeking any meaningful discussion. I think that is an impasse that cannot be solved by reddits platform.

       "I think it depends on what you look for when you read a conspiracy theory, if it's all akin to a giant boardgame then watching the movement of a single piece allows you to infer the intentions of the player who moved it."

        But why are you trusting the information to begin with? If you place ANY faith in articles, news, books and information, you are open to being manipulated. You are relying on a stranger to form the way you view reality, and nothing is more dangerous than that.

        No, we do not. We draw on everything we've been taught through schooling, our parents, our friends, television, books and aesthetic reality. We don't own any truly original, independent thoughts, but it is possible for people who are capable from drawing truth from the universe.

         Not if the conspiracies were specifically written to distract you.

        You simply can't tell the difference between a real and a fake conspiracy, and so it's no use attempting to tell them apart. Constantly investigating them is quite literally the definition of insanity. I did it for 8 years- no more. I realize now that they were cherries, put there to keep me from working my way down the tree, and to it's roots.

       An example of a state of mind i try to keep myself in? I'm not sure how to give an example of that.

      <p>
       The point I'm making is that you don't know which aspect of the illusion I'm pushing against. You seem to push for the idea that anything therefore everything could be fake so there is no point looking at any of it. My point would be that the fakery is obvious at times and it's worth pointing that out to someone so as to break the fourth wall for them.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can't state in one instance that conspiracies exist to distract us and then say that I can't tell the difference between a real one and a fake one. Either there are real ones (in other words, it's true that there are entities that plot and scheme to our detriment) or their aren't and it's all an illusion which would still be a conspiracy since i find the illusion displeasing- I'm certainly not consciously trying to propagate any illusion so that must mean it is in part due to something else other than that thing I know of as "me"
      </p>
      <p>
       You neatly bring up the manipulation present in articles, news, books and information but then tell me it's not worth my time to dig into conspiracy? That's part of the conspiracy I want to talk about. I feel like you possess an equally capable talent of talking circles into existence out of nothing.

        Sure I can, because the truth itself is a contradiction. 9/11 is the only conspiracy I or anyone else is truly capable of assimilating. It's the only conspiracy any of us can be sure of. I've been to the memorial, I've seen the massive holes in the ground.

      <ul>
       <li>
        They are both real and illusory. 9/11 was real in the sense that those buildings came down. Everything else, including the planes, is speculation, and frankly, isn't even important. So, a certain amount of the physicality of that day was real, but none of the motives behind it were, and that's the illusory part. That's the part that important for 'Them'-
        <strong>
         the illusion of evil.
        </strong>
        If monsters are real, we can't exactly do anything about it, can we? They are both real and illusory.

        Because YOU didn't write them. You don't have the foggiest idea if the author is trustworthy, or that he hasn't been mislead. If you were to trace a conspiracy theory back to it's origins- you will find the government on the other end, every single time.

       I'm glad that you responded the way you did. Somehow, via a conversation of sorts, we are now aware of how each other sees things. That is roughly where I'm at. The only thing I care about anymore is why are we being convinced of the duality of good and evil and can good exist without the polarity of evil.
      </p>
      <p>
       Can't get to that stage without being all the actors in between so I'd still encourage the asking of questions. It's almost like zen right? Ask questions until you realize that the question only exists because you ask it. That gives the questions their worth, in a way.

       Eventually it all boils down to beauty, and beauty is either symmetry, asymmetry, or colors. It's not real. Good isn't real either. It's about as real as evil. I'm not saying love isn't real, it is, but we barely love ourselves, let alone strangers.

        Then you are in the right place mentally, but i just feel like you're looking in the wrong places. The justifications for the way the world is can be found in continental philosophy, and the justifications for it can be found in all religions. Here's the kind of logic we're really up against:

       <a href="http://www.markfoster.net/struc/criticalpedagogy.html">
        "It is only the oppressed who, by freeing themselves, can free their oppressors. The latter, as an oppressive class, can free neither others nor themselves. It is therefore essential that the oppressed wage the struggle to resolve the contradiction in which they are caught; and the contradiction will be resolved by the appearance of the new man: neither oppressor nor oppressed, but man in the process of liberation.'

       We can thank the Bible for it: it puts forward engineered suffering so that we can work our way out of it through total assimilation of the understanding of life.

        Simply ask the universe to reveal its secrets to you, deny your ego, deny all information, and truth will flood your brain with so much force, and frequency as to become an entirely new person in just days. Science has already proven that consciousness doesn't die when we die. It's also proven that past, present, and future are all happening together. That makes it possible that you are simply interacting with different versions of yourself from different time periods overlapping with your own. It makes it possible that you could be the only person on the earth in your space time dimension. It makes it possible that all things truly are one.

       I realized i had already read your reddit submission but I read it again to familiarize myself with it, some points i agreed with but not all.
The page about critical pedagogy took me a while to go through, I'm not sure i agree with it.
       <br/>
       It seems to present the idea that the cycle of oppressor vs oppressed is the issue and thus the solution is to create a constant cycle in everyone's life where they become the oppressed whilst oppressing.
       <br/>
       Sort of like trying to embody the cycle so as to stop going around it, the result is that they have engineered the education system to indoctrinate children whilst leaving them with no meaningful skills.
      </p>
      <p>
       Any of the worthy ideas the page presented to me should occur within a meaningful relationship between a parent and a child whilst the education system should remain for conveying useful skills and expertise. This seems to be a widespread application of hitting someone with a stick to repeatedly so that they can be oppressed until they reach the point that they grab the stick and hit back and realize they can be oppressor as well?
      </p>
      <p>
       I may be seeing this the wrong way in which case feel free to provide an alternative perspective but this just seems like a way of deepening the illusion, I'd have been happy in a small Japanese village in the mountains meditating, working a small field following the ways of the samurai and just being.

       Why would it ever be right to fuel all this left vs right, good vs bad, female vs male, up vs down, blue vs red, tribe vs tribe; it seems like you're saying they are trying to distill this duality within a single human experience as a way of becoming something more.

        Yes, and they are supposed to throw the stick away, eventually. Perhaps it's not even hitting back, but simply dropping out. All I want to know is how the fuck I'm supposed to feed, clothe, and house myself once I do decide to no longer compete?

Attaching the ruleset is the only thing that has ever made me feel alive and independent, and that's exactly why they put those rules there. So people who have truly independent thought would end up kicked out of school, on drugs, and in prison. I've learned from more from all of the bad things I

       It seems we really are on similar tracks of mind; the limitation of my drug use is only it's availability which is very limited. I've seen no course of action that leads to a way out except what is seen as the most destructive form of action.

       I see no way in which I can provide for myself without being connected to this system so either another method of providing for myself must be found or my needs must change.

       Just so that others don't have to descend into this pointless conversation, this is a reference to the (fact, really, at this point) that the Boston bombing never happened.  The "evil" that "they" want us to believe in is the existence of random terror.

       Thanks a lot for this TL:DR, I did not feel like making that incredibly vague and slow moving decent. Figured that's what he meant, but also thought he was saying "they" want us to believe in a big conspiracy.

       How can you say that it never happened? There's thousands of pictures, videos, testimonies, court cases, people walking around with prosthetics, records of people mass donating blood, video of him being captured, details of his sentencing, evidence taken from his dorm, evidence taken from the scene and even a few blocks away. You probably saw a few pictures or a single video and said "Yup! This is it. It's fake." and completely shut out the massive amounts of evidence that is clearly fucking happened. You're paranoid and I hope you get help. Maybe go stop at big pharma and get some brain control pills or whatever else you believe in.

       I railed against conspiracy theories like a fucking plebeian for 8 years. Then I made my way to Critical Theory, Critical Pedagogy, and Radical Critical Pedagogy. These are negative social sciences, and every university on the globe is pushing them. They advocate engineered suffering. Why do you suppose that is?

       Shill is just the number one theory, you haven't provided enough information to make a final determination.
      </p>
      <p>
       Although now I know you did time, that provides additional evidence, since I know a lot of former prisoners are recruited to take part in constructing the American Prison state. You could easily be providing a half truth for authenticity, where that half truth only further confirms your true nature.

       Your invented credentials don't speak to your competence, they just make you sound even more suspicious.

       9/11 was probably allowed due to incompetence, but I'm not really interested in it because there are more pressing examples of corruption within the hidden state.

       I trust no one but myself and a few close confidants, and I've found that in order to have an accurate view of the world, this is necessary. Even most well-meaning people, even most geniuses and public intellectuals and good men are usually self-deluded. They have a host of inherited delusions as cornerstones of their entire philosophy, and as such their opinions are founded on quicksand.

       You stream of thoughts are really disjointed. To a reasonable mind, none seems to follow rationally from the previous one. I will not call you a shill, but I will say that you write just like most of those I've isolated. Purposely obtuse so as to wreck discourse. The devil's work. Food for thought.

       I highly doubt this is true. The people who arrested Tsarnaev were local and state police. The FBI's Hostage Rescue Team did not arrest him. HRT may have been deployed to aid in the manhunt but they didn't do much.
      </p>
      <p>
       The two agents in question died in a genuine training accident. They were practicing fast-roping from a helicopter when the helicopter in question moved enough to cause the two FBI agents rappelling down to lose their grip and fall to their deaths. Not really a conspiracy, just a tragedy.

       This is why its not good to direct hate towards cops and grunts for doing the jobs they're forced to do, they're just as expendable to the elites as we are, they just happen to have batons and firearms and tear gas and all that advanced weaponry.

       Can anyone find a source that says they were involved in the arrest of the boston bombers (and not just in the same organisation that was) ?

       If not, this whole thread is worthless because the title is saying something which is most likely false.

       Thanks a lot for this TL:DR, I did not feel like making that incredibly vague and slow moving decent. Figured that's what he meant, but also thought he was saying "they" want us to believe in a big conspiracy.

       How can you say that it never happened? There's thousands of pictures, videos, testimonies, court cases, people walking around with prosthetics, records of people mass donating blood, video of him being captured, details of his sentencing, evidence taken from his dorm, evidence taken from the scene and even a few blocks away. You probably saw a few pictures or a single video and said "Yup! This is it. It's fake." and completely shut out the massive amounts of evidence that is clearly fucking happened. You're paranoid and I hope you get help. Maybe go stop at big pharma and get some brain control pills or whatever else you believe in.
