    <div class="md"><p>Outside of large-scale terror attacks, most of those issues are really media creations of the reality they want people to believe in. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t mean that in the false flag sense, but in the sense that even Charlottesville was a fucking joke compared to things that go on every day in this country. </p>

<p>Think of how much reaction and demand for restrictions on speech there were (even the ACLU changing its long-held policy of content-neutral advocacy) and how it&#39;s STILL an issue that&#39;s brought up to make a point.</p>

<p>Now think back to the Pulse shooting. A massacre of 49 fucking people. And it&#39;s barely a blip in the media memory. </p>

<p>It&#39;s about constructing the reality they want you to believe you live in. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You don&#39;t have to give it all up, just do further research. Take everything with a grain of salt, and always question things, especially things that don&#39;t add up. In times of crisis ask who&#39;s to gain, always be speculative and never trust things at face value. Even media you may consider trustworthy should be questioned. Our reality is a maze, it&#39;s impossible to know most things for sure, so always ask questions!</p>

I made sure to mention how minor the turnout was for the Charlottesville nonsense compared to the amount of people speaking out against it.

    <div class="md"><p>The technical answers will never be adequate or satisfactory, but there is something that can be done by every individual that adds up. </p>

<p>Be your own rock. Never allow social or cultural pressures to bully you into intellectual submission. That&#39;s not obstinance for its own sake, however. It&#39;s being willing to demand explanations and not let the pressure fill in the nonsensical gaps. </p>

<p>The one thing they can never fully control is the human search for justice and explanation. They can only manipulate and bully. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I always approach what could be sensationalism from this perspective. I ask myself the simple question:  &quot;can I effect change&quot;. If I can I do. For example, with all of the racial tension being exacerbated by the media, the only way I could effect change was to be a nonjudgmental human being, to be a grateful and loving person. If I cannot effect change I contemplate what it is being reported. I think about how it will affect my family and my children&#39;s future from all angles. I ask myself again how I can effect change. If I cannot effect change I spend no more energy or emotion on it. Usually the things that matter, and are not bullshit, you can affect one way or another. It is by design the things that are bullshit you can have virtually no impact on. This leaves us all more helpless and dependent, which is the point. </p>
