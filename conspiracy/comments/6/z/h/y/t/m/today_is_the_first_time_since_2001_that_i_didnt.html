I can&#39;t imagine it but I&#39;m willing to accept anything after understanding a part of what the deep state is. They have trillions of dollars in assets, a world military, the CIA/FBI, 95% of news media. Yet they don&#39;t everyone convinced. Thank god for the internet and experts such as the engineers and architects (and first responders) that are willing to make a statement about what they know. The_Donald is entertainment only at this point and I hope Trump isn&#39;t part of the deeply-embedded power.</p>

<p>THe DoD switched the airplanes and gassed the passengers while Mossad placed explosives and detonated them in the three towers.</p>

<p>I really wonder what was so incriminating in building 7.  Best hypothesis is there was evidence in there that implicated Israel in the Kennedy assassination.  Getting rid of JFK took away the obstacle between Tel Aviv stealing nukes from the US.</p>

<p>It&#39;s called poisoning the well. Some people like to give extreme theories that are implausible. They do this to make it seem like all stories outside the &quot;official narrative&quot; are extreme and ridiculous. Some people also claim that the planes were holograms or that the buildings were downed by &quot;directed zero point energy attacks&quot; or something. They do this to discourage people from considering alternate explanations. Basically, they want to make us look stupid by association. </p>

Gassing the passengers on the &quot;placeholder&quot; planes, if you will, would just be an extrapolation adjacent to the main idea. They could have been &#39;gassed&#39; with bullets too, it&#39;s irrelevant to the idea that the planes were landed and swapped (&quot;is this real world, or exercise?&quot;) for something with the necessary punch.</p>

unmistakable pattern seems to emerge.
Every person who has ever harmed me in
my lifetime-the boss who fired me, the
teacher who flunked me, the principal who
punished me, the kid who hit me in the eye
with a rock, the other kid who shot me
with his BB gun, the executive who didn&#39;t
renew TVNation, the guy who was stalking
me for three years, the accountant who
double-paid my taxes, the drunk who
smashed into me, the burglar who stole my
stereo, the contractor who overcharged me,
the girlfriend who left me, the next
girlfriend who left even sooner, the pilot of
the plane I was on who hit a truck on the
runway (he probably hadn&#39;t eaten in days),
the other pilot who decided to fly through a
tornado, the person in the office who stole
checks from my checkbook and wrote
them out to himself for a total of $16,000--
every one of these individuals has been a
white person! Coincidence? I think not!</p>

<p>I have never been attacked by a black
person, never been evicted by a black
person, never had my security deposit
ripped off by a black landlord, never had a
black landlord, never had a meeting at a
Hollywood studio with a black executive
in charge, never seen a black agent at the
film /IV agency that used to represent me,
never had a black person deny my child the
college of her choice, never been puked on
by a black teenager at a Motley Crue
concert, never been pulled over by a black
cop, never been sold a lemon by a black
car salesman, never seen a black car
salesman...</p>

<p>Arabs in caves did 911, even though some are alive, couldn&#39;t fly for shit, and WTC7 wasn&#39;t hit by a plane but fell like controlled demolition. </p>

<p>You fall for the official dumbass theory regarding 9/11, that arabs, directed by a super genius living in a fucking cave leveled the financial district of Manhattan, part of the pentagon, four airplanes, and 3000 people. </p>

<p>Are you on dial up, you are clearly too lazy to look up the facts for yourself.</p>

<p>There is no REAL surveilance video released to the goyim showing the 911 hijackers on 911 at the final airports. No arab bodies listed on the autopsy list for the Pentagon.</p>

<p>To a degree. Give a lot of power to a normal person, and they&#39;d likely turn into a piece of shit asshole. It takes a special brand of sociopath to approve of using a false flag attack in the middle of Manhattan, not just everyone would make use of such a thing to advance an authoritative surveillance state. Would you kill thousands of your own citizens just so you can trick them into accepting further subjugation? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Human nature no. But that is certainly the argument those with power want you to believe in order to keep and perpetuate their power, and class position. The same can be said for the state apparatus. &quot;You need us because ABC reasons.&quot; Actually we don&#39;t. Never did. Never will.  </p>

<p>Human nature is largely predicated on our material conditions, socialization, conditioning, etc. Eg. Greed is learned; It&#39;s not some natural phenomenon based on any  overriding biology... Unless of course you are a socio or psychopath or something. But for the majority, that shit is merely learned. </p>

<p>On that note, I recommend everyone read Peter Kropotkin&#39;s work, <em>Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution (1902.)</em></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ive always been doubtful but not 100 percent confident it was a lie. What i can say if it was all a lie can you imagine how many peoples loved ones were tricked into fighting and dying over a lie? MILLIONS would have died over a lie. </p>

<p>A government that would kill millions over a lie should not exist. So i dont know for sure the truth about 9 11 what i can say is ic enough peopld TRULY believe it was fake they shouldnt be going 2 bed at night they should be trying to amass a civilian army to overthrow the government.</p>

<p>Because if it is true that 9 11 was a well orchestrated tactic to force millions to die so a few could profit that is a very big problem. If they did yet away with it it explains why they got confident enough to try and pull off sandyhook.</p>

<p>When people were not buying that shit they classified all the information to stop researchers from digging 2 deep.</p>

<p>I think people who wre not interested in finding and knowing the truth are mentally ill. I think people who dont mind being ruled by those who would kill millions for konetary gains are &quot;mentally ill&quot; but we can never know the truth about 9 11 we can only speculate.</p>

<p>What we can learn though is to always be VERY observant going forward.</p>

We don&#39;t know the exact manner of how the planes hit, if they were real passenger planes, if they had bombs aboard them. But we do know there were &quot;war games&quot; or so called training exercises taking place at the exact time of flight controllers in a hi stress scenario involving hijacked planes being blown into buildings and targets. They were being distracted from something no doubt. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRJbg2fXXjU&amp;amp;t=4s">At first they actually thought the planes being flown into buildings were not real</a> because they were faking it at the exact same time.  Not to mention it was the first time basically in modern history fighter jets did not intercept at all, much less within minutes of transponders going off. </p>

<p>In fact some of the terrorists they named as being the hijackers, were later found <a href="http://911research.wtc7.net/mirrors/guardian2/september-eleven/hijackers-alive.htm">alive and well</a> ...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah I got banned from my favourite sub because of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/6za0ln/can_you_imagine_a_world_without_islam/dmucd6e/?context=3">this</a> post. </p>

<p>It just baffles me that people actually believe the official story. And the fact that the official story is so mainstream and the &quot;conspiracy&quot; theory&#39;s around 9/11 are mocked only makes me think there is a larger conspiracy in itself with the media (not just MSM) that is put in front of our faces.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Really, as far as I know all of that would be speculation. We don&#39;t know the exact manner of how the planes hit, if they were real passenger planes, if they had bombs aboard them. But we do know there were &quot;war games&quot; or so called training exercises taking place at the exact time of flight controllers in a hi stress scenario involving hijacked planes being blown into buildings and targets. They were being distracted from something no doubt. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRJbg2fXXjU&amp;amp;t=4s">At first they actually thought the planes being flown into buildings were not real</a> because they were faking it at the exact same time.  Not to mention it was the first time basically in modern history fighter jets did not intercept at all, much less within minutes of transponders going off. </p>

<p>In fact some of the terrorists they named as being the hijackers, were later found <a href="http://911research.wtc7.net/mirrors/guardian2/september-eleven/hijackers-alive.htm">alive and well</a> ...</p>
