        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>First things first, this is just my opinion and I want (hope) to see a discussion about this, and hear what you guys think.</p>

<p>The Telecom Act of 1996 was a couple of things. Predominantly, it granted private businesses the ability to obtain larger market shares of radio stations. At the time, still true today, the radio was how most Americans listened to music. </p>

<p>So what does this have to do with Vietnam? </p>

<p>That era of music is one that will be remember as possibly one of the greatest of all time. The Doors, The Beatles Jimi Hendrix, CCR, The Rolling Stones, the list goes on. So much of their music was about Vietnam. Nothing good. In fact, much of their music was insulting our government for Vietnam. How we should end the war. How it was a war not to preserve freedom, but to impose it on those who didn&#39;t want it.</p>

<p>These songs were played on the radio 24/7. It&#39;d be fair to say that almost every person in the US liked at least one of those popular bands, songs, etc. These artists roles in influencing our population was, in my view, the number 1 reason our population changed their opinions.</p>

<p>Our involvement in the Middle East arguably stemmed from the Bush Sr. Administration, which was short lived. At this time we still saw many anti-war songs, this time specifically about the Middle East. Most noteably, &quot;Too Many Puppies&quot;, &quot;Civil War&quot;, and &quot;Heal the World&quot;. It&#39;s obvious that musicians were still against the Govs stupid wars, as was our population.</p>

<p>Now comes along the Clinton Administration; the ones who passed the Telecom Act. There wasn&#39;t much involvement in the middle east, militarily, during his era, but this is where we started taking an interest in the Palestinians and Israelis.</p>

<p>Then comes Dubya. We all know what happened here. He started a war, not just on terrorists, but countries that &#39;were involved with terrorism&#39;. At this point, over 90% of the media is now owned by 6 companies. Companies that drove out bands, drove in single artists, told them what to make music about, and paid them shitloads of cash. </p>

<p>When&#39;s the last time you heard and anti-war song on the radio? Maybe once in awhile if you happen to catch an oldies station at the right time. How often do you hear some pop/rap/rock/whatever garbage that talks about drugs, sex, fuck-the-police, or whatever nonsense? Every god damn day on every god damn station.</p>

<p>My point is the Telecom Act of &#39;96 was a lot of things, but the strange disappearance of anti government/war rhetoric took a sharp decline is what I believe to be the larger part of the conspiracy. Our children no longer listened to &#39;fuck the government, fuck war, we need peace&#39; on a daily basis. They now hear the same, recycled content that those 6 media giants push out over and over again. </p>

<p>I think if we had the same artists from the 60&#39;s in the 2000&#39;s, the wars in the Middle East would not have held ground for too long.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is an awesome theory. So, the radio station are now in the hands of people who can likely afford and own huge chunks of the MIC. It is in their best interests to have America building war material and making war. So when the dickheads in the CIA slime their way over, these companies are happy to oblige.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Telecoms act played no small part in a massive consolidation of the industry by &#39;the big 4&#39; in the 90s.</p>

<p>Digital was starting to take hold, which meant indies were a dying breed. Unfortunately the indies were traditionally home to the protest song.</p>

<p>And when the indies were all but dead, we were left with an MIC ran industry (as you&#39;ve already said). </p>

<p>Once people understand that, they can begin to understand how Rihanna singing about big cocks and being a pimp, is the new norm.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great theory but just remember that just like with cable anyone who really listens to music can still get access to that kind of sound with the streaming apps. </p>

<p>There&#39;s no denying that the Telecom&#39;s own the FM band and they know their audience. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks. Saving this to search for it later after the games today.</p>

<p>From what little I have heard about it, a lot of the anti-war bands came from the same area and the theory is they were pushed to the top by some nefarious group?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In the Bill Clinton era, the Republican Congress introduced and passed many bills. Bill Clinton signed them. In many cases, a large number of Democrats supported the Republican bills, and sometimes even had veto proof majorities.</p>

<p>The Senate telecom vote went all voting Republicans yes, and more than half of Democrats yes. <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/104-1995/s268">https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/104-1995/s268</a></p>

<p>The media itself and its corporate masters wanted deregulation badly. They did all they could to put a positive spin on these bills -- when they mentioned them at all. For that, many legislators had reason to fear: go up against the media and see where it gets you. They should have stood against it <em>anyway</em> because the result was entirely predictable. The media now holds even more subversive pressure over politicians and elections. </p>

<p>1996 Telecommunications Act was the follow up to major deregulation during the Ronald Reagan years. Without the Reagan deregulation, the 1996 act would never have existed.</p>

<p>Specifically, the 1996 act did one very important thing -- it increased the amount of media saturation large conglomerates could own.</p>

<p>Reagan deregulation was truly comprehensive. Before Reagan, media companies were not owned by banks, industry, and other types of corporations. Before Reagan, there were public interest rules that required not only &quot;both&quot; sides be covered, but also that many sides be covered, and even required publication of viewer editorials. Before Reagan, media companies were not allowed to produce most of their broadcast material. Before Reagan, there had to be news and actual data coverage. Before Reagan, commercial time was limited. Before Reagan, networks were not allowed to own their affiliates. Before Reagan, there were rules against cable monopolies. And the list goes on.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think that the decline in anti-war media was less because of the 1996 Telecommunications Act and more of capitalism being capitalism. The reason Vietnam was so unpopular was because there was a draft that sucked up every high school graduate who couldn&#39;t get into college and made them fight for a cause they might not have agreed with in a country that was being used as a political pawn in the never ending fight against communism perpetuated by their elected officials lying to start the war and reneging on their promises to end it.</p>

<p>The reason our involvement in Afghanistan and Pakistan post-9/11 hasn&#39;t generated the same cultural outrage is because of 9/11 and the lack of a draft. In Vietnam, the Gulf of Tonkin incident (regardless of whether or not it really happened) was extremely far removed from all but US diplomats in the region. 9/11, by contrast, was an attack on US soil, broadcast live to the nation by the news media, which had Americans instantly up in arms. The war was politically popular at its outset, although it certainly has declined since then. But even though a fair amount of people don&#39;t support the war today, the only people fighting are those who volunteered to do so, so there&#39;s really not much for artists to loathe about, and without the imminent threat of getting drafted yourself, there&#39;s not much appeal to those songs.</p>

<p>I&#39;m curious why you think this law caused the downfall of counter-culture media. Despite most radio stations being controlled by a few companies, they aren&#39;t going to refuse to play popular music that still fits with the station theme -
 radio isn&#39;t very profitable these days, especially with competition from music streaming services and internet radio, so they can&#39;t really afford to be out of touch.</p>
