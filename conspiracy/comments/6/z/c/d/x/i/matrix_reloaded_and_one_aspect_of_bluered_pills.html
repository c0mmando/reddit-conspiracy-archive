        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Many people hated the later two movies of the <em>Matrix</em> movies. Let&#39;s put aside all of that, and just talk about the mythology and the important shift of the second movie.</p>

<p>It becomes clear through <em>Matrix: Reloaded</em> that Neo is not what we think he is. It becomes clear also that Morpheus is a religious zealot that many people back in Zion do not necessarily agree with but find personally compelling and charismatic. Morpheus acts with great conviction and fidelity to his cause, but it also becomes clear from the narrative that he is blinded by these same qualities. He thinks it is fate, or destiny, or <em>providence</em> that three objectives are met with three captains, but he does not see that all of the events of the movies up to the point of Neo returning to the Source are themselves orchestrated by the systems of control already in place. It is important to recognize this.</p>

<p>These systems of control also include the <em>pills</em>, the trace programs used to locate and extricate people from the Matrix. What first appears to be a form of <em>freedom</em> from the Matrix later in the narrative becomes exceedingly more complex: freedom from one layer of a controlled reality only occurs within <em>larger</em> systems of control, specifically systems of control that co-opt the liberated redpills and Zionists and use them for <em>genetic</em> as well as <em>energetic</em> manipulations both within and without the Matrix. The waking reality experienced by the Zionists is still part of the overall mechanisms of control, just as the Zionists still use machines in order to survive far beneath the surface of the ruined earth. The dangerous game played by the Architect, the Oracle, and the entire <em>Matrix itself</em> incorporates these apparent freedoms in order to supplement control, for ends we as the audience are not entirely shown.</p>

<p>In the larger narrative <em>outside</em> the movie, the concept of the red pill presents people with a quick means of assigning to others or themselves the status of being <em>woke</em> to the realities we have previously been dreaming within. To say it differently, we say that someone has &quot;taken the red pill&quot; if they say or act as though they can now see past the systems of control. But this is clearly not the case in <em>M:R</em>, because all of the people who have been redpilled and taken back to Zion are corralled there for destruction by the Machines <em>yet again</em>. It may be the Architect is lying or misinforming Neo that they have already destroyed Zion multiple times, but there is little reason for the Architect to lie at that point. Consider also how Morpheus, in his horror at the end of <em>M:R</em>, not only recognizes the end of his dream in the destruction of the <em>Nebuchadnezzar</em>, becomes aware, as Neo&#39;s own testimony reveals, that what Morpheus had been doing the entire time while believing he was freeing minds from the Matrix was, in fact, sustaining the control the Machines have upon the Humans. Every red pill from his hands was still part of the victory of the Machines over the Humans. <em>That</em> is the real dark night for any person who believes in their entire mission to save or liberate, their fidelity to the cause of freedom: they have been not only living within and under a lie, but <em>advancing the deeper aspects of the lie</em>. My suggestion, then, is that we need to become even more critical of casually believing and using these expressions, whether being awakened from our dream or taking the red pill.</p>

<p>The dream from which Morpheus awakens <em>only returns as a dream</em> for him when he witnesses the machines, after already having killed thousands of his fellows in the breach of Zion in <em>Revolutions</em>, suddenly suspend in mid-air and <em>stall</em>. In this moment, Morpheus cannot tell the difference between reality and dream â€”this is the moment of experiencing <em>hyperreality</em>.</p>

<p>When you first awaken from the dreaming, you begin to crawl in a reality that disorients and confuses, yet feels so much more vital or important to you. You should not at all confuse, though, this feeling with having achieved a Real for which there is no corresponding dream.</p>

<p>If anything, the mythology of the <em>Matrix</em> movies shows that believing a <em>trace program</em>, a single pill experience, is all you need to awaken from the dream is incomplete, since it is <em>all</em> experienced simultaneously within multiple layers where control operates through <em>both</em> reality and dream, neither of which arises independently of the other.</p>

<p>It also means that those of us who believe we have awakened must constantly practice <em>vigilance</em> to discern the contours and limits of our experience, separating out the dreaming from the waking, even to the point of <em>not preferring</em> either one as our home but moving through both in order to discern what is <em>beyond</em> both dream and waking life (remember how the zooming scenes into and out of the code of the Matrix reveal there are universes and code configurations that are <em>not connected to the activity of the narratives of the movies!</em> This becomes much more obvious as the movies progress). Now, I said &#39;simultaneously&#39; in that other paragraph, but I also want to say that I do mean this in a much deeper sense: from a vantage point outside of our lives, all of our choices really are <em>non-linear</em> with respect to the narratives we enact, subject to the limitations your particular mythological approach places upon you.</p>

<p>To that extent, see past the red and the blue, the black and the light. We will need vigilance in the time that is now upon us all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Bravo, well observed and explained! An old friend used to say &quot;the red pill and the blue pill are both from the same pharma company&quot;. It is a feature of the Matrix to assimilate dissent; it has been accounted for a million times over (just look what it did to &quot;Occupy Wall Street&quot;: gave them hipster &quot;forethinkers&quot; the Deutsche Bank lobby to convene while the &quot;foot soldiers&quot; remained outside getting pepper sprayed; even their tent city mirrored the stratification of society). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The more &quot;woke&quot; you are, the greater the level of control or sophistication of control needed.  And that second to last paragraph is right on, but instead of separating dreaming from waking, it is separating truth from fiction, and recognizing the truth IN fiction.  Just like the content of your post.  And applying that knowledge to yourself and your life.  I think it&#39;s like how some people consider works of fiction semi-autobiographical, and maybe it&#39;s just that all work has levels of subconscious or unconscious thought; even a shopping list may be ordered in a subconsciously interesting way.  Works of fiction may be like Freudian folds or something in the collective unconscious.  Be interesting thinking that thoughts may effectively make the collective unconscious more dimensional by making shapes or adding &quot;faces&quot; or planes.  Woah...starting to sound like Jim Carrey.  </p>

<p>Part of being red pilled is realizing that &quot;the&quot; red pill is blue pilled. Awareness and self-actualization are processes rather than singular events. The dialectic of the red pill / blue pill is itself a con in a significant way.</p>
