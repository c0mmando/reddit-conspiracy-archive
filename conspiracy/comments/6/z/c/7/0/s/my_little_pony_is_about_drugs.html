        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Actually this is about the newsmedia, im just trying to spoof the &quot;nitelige gaenyc&#39;s&quot; vote bots.  If you like what you read upvote and that&#39;ll suffice for other users instead of a clear title.</p>

<p>I think the media in America is completely compromised.  How do average people know things except what they read in the NY Times amd Politico?  If most of these organizations are compromised, then of course most people would be misinformed.</p>

<p>When other evidence from alternative sources adds up and what&#39;s probably reasonably true doesn&#39;t conform to America&#39;s public narrative (that there was never a coup in Ukraine and that the US doesn&#39;t support coups), or when the American public narrative itself soesnt make sense and is internally inconsistent, then we conspiracy theorists conclude something rotten is at hand.</p>

<p>But then shills come out and say &quot;politico this&quot;, &quot;ny times that&quot;.  As if thats proof of something.</p>

<p>This is why things are so bad: our media reality is horrifying.  And most people would never be able to confront how universal and horrifying the media problem is.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But a lot of the muh russia trump shills keep citing mainstream sources as if they&#39;re zingers which prove some kind of deep conspiracy.  My point was directed at that kind of argument.  And given the nature of shills I think there&#39;s a potential for bot activity so I specifically wanted to hide this conversation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Reality in general can&#39;t be trusted. Just follow your heart, stick to your guns (literally and figuratively) and hope/try for the best while preparing for the worst. Don&#39;t let your emotions and psychic energy be compromised and controlled by how blatantly the evil forces fuck with us.</p>

<p>There&#39;s the satanic imagery on the pieces of paper &#39;they&#39; want us to be chasing for. The many media outlets and their own particular flavor of vomit they push. Social programming in various beloved TV shows. The perversion of religion and philosophy. The control of information (imagine if Google was the Library of Alexandria, and then one day the FCC does away with net neutrality just because they can and really they can whenever, or Google themselves put a hold on all your digital information and demand complete allegiance. It&#39;d be a massive burning of all of humanity&#39;s accomplishments and left in the hands of a few very very bad people), health-care services and common access to not-poisoned foods in general, the education system. </p>

<p>It&#39;s all fucked up man. </p>

<p>And what works for me is not giving those negative realizations more than 2 minutes of my week. People have always been misinformed. We&#39;re talking monkeys for fuckssake. Our best bet is aliens at this point, christ.</p>

<p>Let happiness and being kind and helpful and not thinking negatively about people who aren&#39;t &quot;woke&quot; or whatever the buzzword is this season, be your revenge.</p>

<p>Dont get caught up in the bullshit dude. There&#39;s a lot of awesome things to check out in life, food banks and soup kitchens to volunteer at. There&#39;s cooler news than news, it&#39;s in the comics section, check em out.</p>

<p>Oh and lastly, always remember to make love, not war.</p>

<p>Ps: random fucking title dude. </p>
