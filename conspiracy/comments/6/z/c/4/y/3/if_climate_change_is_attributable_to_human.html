       The temperature records are not consistent with the theory that human “greenhouse” gas emissions are the primary cause of global warming. Those records do not show temperatures rising in conjunction with such ever rising emissions as the globe increasingly industrializes. Instead, the temperature record shows an up and down pattern that follows the pattern of natural influences on global temperatures, such as cyclical sunspots and solar flares, and cycles of ocean churning from warmer to colder temperatures and back, such as the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO).
      </p>
      <p>
       Moreover, the incorruptible and objective satellite temperature records show only modest warming starting in the late 1970s, which stopped roughly 10 years ago, with more recent declines. That is consistent with temperature proxy records found in nature, such as tree rings and ice cores. But that diverges significantly from the corruptible and subjectively compiled land based records, the repeated manipulation of which has prompted several prominent climate scientists to call for an investigation.
      </p>
      <p>
       In addition, the work of the UN’s IPCC is based on numerous climate models that attempt to project temperatures decades into the future. Those models are all based on the circular assumption that the theory of man caused global warming is true. As 16 world leading climate scientists recently reported in a letter to the Wall Street Journal,
      </p>
      <p>
       “[A]n important gauge of scientific expertise is the ability to make successful predictions. When predictions fail, we say that the theory is ‘falsified’ and we should look for the reasons for the failure. Shown in the nearby graph is the measured annual temperature of the earth since 1989, just before the first report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Also shown are the projections of the likely increase of temperature, as published in the Summaries of each of the four IPCC reports, the first in the year 1990 and the last in the year 2007.
      </p>
      <p>
       “From the graph it appears that the projections [of the models] exaggerate, substantially, the response of the earth’s temperature to CO2 which increased by about 11% from 1989 through 2011. Furthermore, when one examines the historical temperature record throughout the 20th century and into the 21st, the data strongly suggest a much lower CO2 effect than almost all models calculate.”
      </p>
      <p>
       Seems like the models have been falsified.
      </p>
      <p>
       The likely reason for that failure is that while the models recognize that increased CO2 itself will not produce a big, catastrophic increase in global temperatures, the models assume that the very small amount of warming caused by increased CO2 will result in much larger temperature increases caused by positive feedbacks. The real, emerging science, is that the feedbacks are more likely to be offset by negative feedbacks, resulting in a much smaller net temperature change. Scientists have pointed out that much higher CO2 concentrations deep in the earth’s history, as shown by proxy records, did not result in catastrophic temperature increases, a very powerful rebuttal to the idea today’s relatively low CO2 levels could trigger catastrophic global warming.
      </p>
      <p>
       The results of the latest, most advanced data collection also suggest that CO2 is not responsible for the modest global warming of the late 20th century. The UN models agree with established science that if human greenhouse gas emissions were causing global warming, there should be a hot spot of higher temperatures in the troposphere above the tropics, where collected concentrations would have the greatest effect, and the warming would show up first. This is known in the literature on climate science as “the fingerprint” for man caused global warming. But data from global weather satellites and more comprehensive weather balloons show no hotspot, and no fingerprint, which means no serious global warming due to human greenhouse gas emissions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Moreover, satellites also have been measuring the energy entering the earth’s atmosphere from the sun, and the energy escaping back out to space. If the theory of man caused global warming is correct, then the energy escaping back out should be less than the energy entering, as the greenhouse gases capture some of the energy in the atmosphere. But the satellite data show negligible difference.
      </p>
      <p>
       The real cutting edge in climate science was publicly exposed recently in a book by one of the long time leaders of the German environmental movement, Fritz Vahrenholt, in his new book, The Cold Sun. The book expresses the growing concern among more careful real climate scientists, rather than political scientists, that trends in solar activity portend a return to the cold, limited agricultural output, and widespread disease of the Little Ice Age, or even a more full blown, overdue by historical standards, real ice age.

       The root of the global warming confusion is that the UN is not a disinterested party that can be trusted to compile and interpret the climate science on which the world’s policymakers can rely. The UN sees the theory of man caused catastrophic global warming as a tremendous opportunity for gaining the regulatory and taxation powers of a world government.

       In addition to what I posted initially, which makes it clear that Exxon Mobil was a significant benefactor to this organization, I will add that Exxon did studies in 70's that concluded that burning fossil fuels was causing climate change. Rather then admitting their findings, they kept them secret and started a campaign to mislead the public. Part of their

        game plan

       included establishing and supporting lobbyists and think tanks, such as the Heartland Institute, in order to spread lies and misinformation.

       But it is the point.  The devil can cite scripture for his purpose.   You and I have common ground in not trusting the government.  The governments sole purpose is to protect our rights but these days that primary objective has been lost and forgotten.  The main culprit, in my eyes, are the wealthy.... Big banks, big oil, big pharma, big guns.... our government is here to subsidize their wealth.
      </p>
      <p>
       They can create run pipelines wherever they want and whoever tries to protest it is arrested. They can spill oil and foul our lands and water and they get a slap on the wrist. We are literally fighting wars in the middle east for fossil fuels.

       Lol. Look man, the Paris Accords were a joke.  England is building an airport that will negate the accord by itself.  These hurricanes.  The wildfires. The droughts. The flooding.  Violent and increasing weather events were all predicted as part of the models.
      </p>
      <p>
       The southwest is in all likelihood entering a permanent drought.  Much of the middle east will be uninhabitable in 100 years.   We are literally in the worlds sixth great extinction event, with a dozen or so plants and animals going extinct every day.  We are on track to lose half of all plant and animal species over the coming century.

       This was written by a lawyer named Peter Ferrara, who is an analyst for a conservative think tank called the Heartland Institute.
      </p>
      <p>
       From DESMOG....
      </p>
      <p>
       The Heartland Institute is a Chicago-based free market think tank and 501(c)(3) charity that has been at the forefront of denying the scientific evidence for man-made climate change. The Heartland Institute has received at least $676,500 from ExxonMobil since 1998 but no longer discloses its funding sources. The Union of Concerned Scientists found (PDF) that “Nearly 40% of the total funds that the Heartland Institute has received from ExxonMobil since 1998 were specifically designated for climate change projects.” [1]
      </p>
      <p>
       David Padden founded The Heartland Institute in 1984 and served as its Chairman between 1984 and 1995, co-chairing with Joseph Bast. Padden was also one of the original members of the Board of Directors of the Cato Institute. Padden, a Chicago, IL-based investment banker and then owner of Padden &amp; Company, passed away in October 2011. [13]
      </p>
      <p>
       Padden also served on the original Board of Directors of another organization founded that year, Citizens for a Sound Economy, which later split into two groups, FreedomWorks and Americans for Prosperity (AFP). The Cato Institute and both of these organizations received their initial seed money from Koch Industries. [14]
      </p>
      <p>
       According to a July 2011 Nature editorial,
      </p>
      <p>
       “Despite criticizing climate scientists for being overconfident about their data, models and theories, the Heartland Institute proclaims a conspicuous confidence in single studies and grand interpretations… . makes many bold assertions that are often questionable or misleading. … Many climate skeptics seem to review scientific data and studies not as scientists but as attorneys, magnifying doubts and treating incomplete explanations as falsehoods rather than signs of progress towards the truth. … The Heartland Institute and its ilk are not trying to build a theory of anything. They have set the bar much lower, and are happy muddying the waters.” [15]
      </p>
      <p>
       2012 Heartland Document Leak
      </p>
      <p>
       In 2012, leaked documents revealed some of the Heartland Institute's initiatives and climate change strategy including a tailored high school curriculum. As reported at the New York Times, (“Leak Offers Glimpse of Campaign Against Climate Science”) the Heartland Institute would have help from the Charles G. Koch Foundation to “cast doubt on the scientific finding that fossil fuel emissions endanger the long-term welfare of the planet.”
      </p>
      <p>
       The documents also discussed “Operation Angry Badger,” which the New York Times described as “a plan to spend $612,000 to influence the outcome of recall elections and related fights … in Wisconsin over the role of public-sector unions.” [2], [3]
      </p>
      <p>
       Heartland has promoted itself using a partial quote from The Economist that describes Heartland as “the world's most prominent think-tank promoting scepticism about man-made climate change.” However, the full paragraph in The Economist's 2012 article provides a more complete picture: “The Heartland Institute, the world's most prominent think-tank promoting scepticism about man-made climate change, is getting a lot of heat.”
      </p>
      <p>
       Heartland lost an estimated $825,000 in expected donations, a number of directors and almost its entire branch in Washington, DC shortly after putting up a billboard comparing those who believed in man-made global warming to the Unabomber Ted Kaczynski. At its annual meeting in Chicago, the institute's president, Joseph Bast, said Heartland had 'discovered who our real friends are.' The 100-odd guests who failed to show up for the '7th Climate Conference' were not among them.” [4], [5]

       It is moderated by zealots who ruthlessly censor any and all form of dissent from their alarmist position. This way they can pretend to win arguments, when in reality they have all been refuted. The abuse and censorship does not pertain to simply any dissenting commentator there but to highly credentialed and respected climate scientists as well; Dr. Pielke Sr. has unsuccessfully attempted to engage in discussions there only to be childishly taunted and censored, while Dr. Michaels has been dishonestly quoted and smeared. The irony of the site's oxymoronic name "Skeptical Science" is that the site is not skeptical of even the most extreme alarmist positions.

       LOL nice copy paste. That site uses great sources like a wordpress blog that thinks the elites are controlling the Paris Deal (and other crazy shit that isn't backed up and we have to take their word for it) and
       <a href="http://scienceandpublicpolicy.org">
        http://scienceandpublicpolicy.org

       that casts doubt on climate change because:
      </p>
      <p>
       "
-The climate has changed before (YA NO SHIT...)
- Temp record unreliable
- Models are unreliable
- The earth hasn't warmed since 1998 (LOL!)
- The earth is cooling 
- No consensus
"

      <p>
       Ya you want to talk about propaganda...

      <p>
       It's hard arguing wit someone who believes in shit that's been debunked over and over again...
      </p>

       No they don't, they prove nothing... Everything you've linked to so far either doesn't have their own sources backing up their reasoning, or they are flat out LYING. I'm not going to trust a source that either doesn't back up it's reasoning on 95% of it's claims, or just links to gibberish.

       "Cook  says  that  models  have  made  predictions  that  were
       <br/>
       successfully compared to observations. Except that this is not enough for the models to  be  reliable.  For  them  to  be  reliable,  it  would  have  to  be  the  case  that  the  models have produced no predictions that were inconsistent with the observations -
because one wrong prediction is enough to falsify a model. Clearly, such falsification has taken place  with  all  of  them.  In  particular,  all  IPCC-endorsed  models  predicted  a  warming since 1998 that didn't occur. They're gone. Again, both sides agree that we can't rely on them. Kevin Trenberth agrees that the disagreement of the models and the data is a  travesty.  There  are  hundreds  of  recent  examples  showing  how  deeply  flawed  the existing IPCC-
endorsed models are."

       Updated NASA satellite data show the polar ice caps remained at approximately their 1979 extent until the middle of the last decade. Beginning in 2005, however, polar ice modestly receded for several years. By 2012, polar sea ice had receded by approximately 10 percent from 1979 measurements. (Total polar ice area – factoring in both sea and land ice – had receded by much less than 10 percent, but alarmists focused on the sea ice loss as “proof” of a global warming crisis.)

       Nice graph there, but let's see what happens when you overlap the data and use that to see what the total polar ice area is doing:

        Looks like it's decreasing at a rapid rate

       So, it looks like your source is WRONG! Deal with it.

      <p>
       Oh, and before replying- keep in mind that you are pointing to links that CLAIM to be representing what NASA is saying, while I am responding by posting direct links to what NASA is
       <em>
        actually
       </em>
       saying. Which source do you think has it right?
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's face it- the conspiracy here is that there are a bunch of people conspiring to cover up the true extent of global warming, and the self-proclaimed "climate realists" are unwittingly assisting them in furthering that conspiracy.

       I read that. I saw what it said, I saw what it meant. I then checked their source (NASA) and their source oddly enough said something different.

       Did you look at the picture that I left for you? It's straight from NASA and DIRECTLY contradicts the author's claim that:

      <blockquote>
       <p>

       Your source is WRONG.

       So your source is contradicting himself then, as well as being wron. In the same fucking paper he says "SEA ICE IS STAYING RIGHT AT 1979 LEVELS!!!" and then later saying that it has receded?
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you not see the problem with this?

      <p>
       (He's also wrong about the less than 10% part, too.)

       So- in ADDITION to BOTH of those statements being WRONG, his two statements DIRECTLY CONTRADICT EACH OTHER.

       The only explanations I can think of for this is that the author is  moron or he's getting paid a ton of money.

       I USED to think that he HAD to be getting paid, because NOBODY could be THAT stupid, but after today I'm not so sure...

      <p>
       The article you are linking to talks about just antarctic ice. You are aware that there are two poles, righ?
      </p>
      <p>
       And the source of the graph is NASA. I've linked it multiple times. But then again, reading is hard for you.
      </p>

       Enjoy your crow pie.

       Why do you insist on propagating the conspiracy that global warming isn't happening?
      </p>
      <p>
       You are helping to spread the conspiracy. You are helping the rich to get richer off of the backs of those who will pay for ignoring the effects of climate change.

       Hey I started as an Alarmist myself. It was reading the science and letting that lead to my conclusions (not what I felt was right) that turned me into this asshole.. Human emissions of CO2 is not warming the planet and this is a HUGE conspiracy. Could kill Billions.......

       I read that. I saw what it said, I saw what it meant. I then checked their source (NASA) and their source oddly enough said something different.
      </p>
      <p>
       Did you look at the picture that I left for you? It's straight from NASA and DIRECTLY contradicts the author's claim that:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Since the end of 2012, moreover, total polar ice extent has largely remained above the post-1979 average.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       It hasn't.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your source is WRONG.
      </p>
      <p>
       AND he's part of the conspiracy to hide the extent of global warming's effects on the Earth.
