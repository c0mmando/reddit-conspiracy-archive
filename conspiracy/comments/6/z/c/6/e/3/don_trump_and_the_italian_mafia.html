       The Genovese owned S&amp;A Concrete built the Trump Towers in Manhattan. Donald Trump used Roy Cohn as his attorney who also worked for former Genovese boss Tony Salerno, Gambino boss Carmine Galante, and John Gotti. Atlantic City is ran by the mafia and is where Trump built his casino. Donald Trump purchased the property for his casino from the mafia hitman Salvatore Testa. The Italian Mafia launder their personal profits through casinos and have run Atlantic City from its beginnings. Donald Trump is an associate of the Five Families in New York and Prince Vittorio Emanuele IV is a top owner of the Genovese crime family. Prince Roffredo Gaetani dated Ivana Trump and he is a hidden top owner of the Gambino crime family. Prince Roffredo Gaetani faked his death and is hiding out in Switzerland with Prince Vittorio.

       According to the 29-count indictment, the Genovese group infiltrated concrete companies to control the construction of high-rise buildings in Manhattan, including Trump Plaza.

       Two months later, Trump Management, represented by Roy M. Cohn, turned around and sued the United States government for $100 million (roughly $500 million in today’s terms), asserting that the charges were “irresponsible and baseless.”

       Gotti was arrested after a year on the lam. His grateful bosses hired lawyer-fixer Roy Cohn to see what he could do, and Cohn could do a lot. He got the case knocked down to attempted manslaughter, and Gotti wound up doing less time for killing - two years - than he had done for a hijacking that involved $7,000 worth of women's dresses.

       Anthony (Fat Tony) Salerno, the rough-talking, cigar-chomping boss of the Genovese crime family who rose from running numbers in East Harlem to rigging construction bids on Manhattan skyscrapers, died Monday night, Federal prison officials said yesterday.
      </p>
      <p>
       Roy M. Cohn, Mr. Salerno's lawyer, described his client as a "sports gambler."

       I'm 100% convinced Trump has strong mafia connections. I also believe the person who said (was it FBI Anon?) that if Trump is guilty of anything, it's paying construction bribes.

       The Gaetani family full name is Gaetani-Dell'Aquila-D'Aragona. Salvatore D'Aquila was one of the early bosses of what became the Gambino crime family. The Gotti family which manage the Gambino crime family are Goths. Gotti means Goth. The Gaetani name is related to the Getae people who were closely connected with the Goths.

       I would not call him a Russian double agent or a Neo-Nazi. A mafia front man and Neo-Fascist would be more accurate. He does have some ties with Russian gangsters like Felix Sater however inside the United States the Russian Mafia are subordinate to the Italian Mafia.

       Not anymore. The Russian mafia are experts in money laundering and financial crimes. One of the largest stock frauds committed in history was largely ran by the Russian mafia on behalf of the Italian mafias.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Italian mafia's influence died with their influence in the construction industry. Their power was in physical enforcement and extortion. The Russians were also very involved in extortion in the 90's, but have been largely focused on money laundering and fraud related crimes since there is higher reward.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also OP, you are missing a huge connection Trump had to the Italian mafia with Robert Libutti. Trump Taj Mahal received several fines in the 90's because Trump was circumventing New Jersey gambling bans on Libutti by paying him with luxury cars, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also OP, you are missing an interesting link between Chinese mafia groups and Trump Taj Mahal. The casino employed several Triad members and was a frequent destination for Triad members to launder their money in the 90's.
      </p>

        I made a similar thread on the Italian mafia connections that Trump has.

       I am aware of Libutti but the primary reference is an interview with Libutti's daughter with little documentation other than eye witnesses seeing him in Trump's casino.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Italian Mafia are the founding fathers of organized crime in the US and well built in. They run the casinos. They run Wall Street and extort the businessmen. They fix sports. They are more sophisticated and covert today then their origins. They used the tactic of "feigned retreat" to get out of the headlines back in the 80's. They are still highly active, making large profits, and more of a threat than ever. They are also criminal enterprises owned and controlled by the Black Nobility and do get reorganized and replaced when necessary. The Italian Mafia use Russian and Albanian gangsters to a lot of their dirty work. The Russian Mafia are much smaller inside the US.

       The primary reference should be the $450k in fines that Trump Taj Mahal got from the New Jersey Gambling commission for circumventing their ban. Trump Plaza also received $200k in fines because Libutti was constantly harassing female and black employees at the casino. It's not just based off of an interview.
