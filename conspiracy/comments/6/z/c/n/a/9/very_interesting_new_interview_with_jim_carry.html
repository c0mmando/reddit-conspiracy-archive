    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, I have to say, he&#39;s really refreshing when he&#39;s interviewed lately.  He basically makes a mockery of showbiz and represents a view that probably tens of millions (hundreds of millions?) of people in the west hold. </p>

<p>Pride is an awful characteristic.  It never leads to anything good.  Oh sure, someone will talk about the small-time pride of achieving a goal being a good thing.  I&#39;m talking about that persistent pride - that addiction to pride.  Essentially, hubris.  It&#39;s the ugliest trait.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yah I watched this way earlier today, did he have an answer or just ramble on about tetrahedrons. </p>

<p>Either way this kind of mentality he shows scares me because it appears enlightened. But in reality it&#39;s the lowest of the low kind of irrelevant thinking. It requires no effort. Anyone can say things are meaningless. I kinda feel bad for him. </p>

<p>Holy crap I forgot, I literally had a dream with jim Carey last night, before i saw this. In the dream he was basically mentally retarded - almost like a lobotomy. His mother I think, or nurse was sad because he used to be such a light and now had become this babbling weirdo. And I sort of cared for him. Weird. </p>

<p>If we&#39;re indoctrinated into believing that turtles matter more than humans we won&#39;t feel we have a right to the earth&#39;s basic resources so we won&#39;t whine about it when the elite take access away from us and herd us into prison colonies. I&#39;s all for the turtles, right?</p>
