I&#39;ve never understood the argument about fire intensity and heat not being capable of toppling the towers.
It takes only the heat of a camp fire to make mild steels of a moderate thicknesses glow red and lose structural strength. 
The available materials/ kindling around an average office seem plenty sufficient to weaken and topple the towers considering the weight of the above floors and amount of oxygen exposed due to nonexistent windows.</p>

<p>Convince me...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Forget for a second trying to use these analogies to describe this situation. Think about facts we know:</p>

<p>1) before 2001, no steel framed building has ever collapsed due to fire. On 9/11 that happened 3 times in one day. </p>

<p>2) jet fuel is  kerosene, it simply cannot burn something quickly enough to turn it into molten steel at the rate required to amke buildings collapse like that.</p>

<p>3) go watch any video of the collapse and you&#39;ll notice something important. Most of the smoke from the fires they claim did this were dark black. Why? Because oxygen poor environments burn dark black. Oxygen Rich fires the smoke is white (as would be needed for such a fuel to burn hot enough).</p>

<p>If you have experience with metal as you say, you should at least agree that whether or not kerosene can melt steel, the &quot;simple office fires from furniture&quot; which brought building 7 down at free fall speed (later admitted by NIST) could not have possibly brought it down</p>

    <div class="md"><p>1) I&#39;ll take your word on this one for now.</p>

<p>2) Correct, you could burn kerosene all day long on a pile of steel and not turn it to a molten state or even get it to catch fire.
However... use that kerosene to ignite a pile of furniture and paper, add good ventilation, and you can make steel glow a dull orange.
This renders any previous treatments, shape, or strength void and subject to change.</p>

<p>3) I will pay attention to smoke colors as you suggest, there is some merit to that in general, but some materials also just produce darker, thicker smoke.</p>

<p>I agree I need to read the complete NIST account as a couple of you have suggested.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>2) in this case that actually doesn&#39;t work out, you would need bellows like forced airflow to feed enough oxygen to those fires.</p>

<p>that possibility is debunked by the black smoke billowing out of the building, which actually tells you a lot of the fuel was not even burning completely which means it was oxygen starved.</p>

<p>that should help if you want to understand the whole picture and why the whole jet fuel can&#39;t melt steel beams thing.</p>

<p>jet fuel is basically kerosene <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jet_fuel#Differences_between_Jet_A_and_Jet_A-1">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jet_fuel#Differences_between_Jet_A_and_Jet_A-1</a></p>

<p>the big facts here are the open air burn of kerosene in a 100% ideal situation ie 100% effeciency (aka a never going to happen outside of a controlled lab experiment)</p>

<p>steel takes a ton of energy to melt, and is also pretty damn good at shedding that heat by transfering it along the surface (layman: think how fast aluminum foil heats up and cools down)</p>

<p>i mean there are situation where the jet fuel (forgetting the extremely limited amount of fuel on site at the time) such as liquid oxygen, high pressure air flows, hell even explaining the thermite by saying the terrorists got it on to the planes at the airports.</p>

<p>now as for the office refuse, a regular office fire never gets anywhere remotely close to the high temps to melt steel, let alone steel with fire proofing sprayed on to it.</p>

<p>so the physics of this explanation fall apart pretty god damn fast.</p>

<p>your campfire analogy as a ton of problems of scale. first i would love to see anything short of a burning man scale bonfire emit enough heat to melt a steel beam half the size of what is in most structures, localized heat is one thing but remember steel spreads heat very quickly (think the handle of a cast iron pan) </p>

<p>second an open air fire, not fed with bellows is never going to get hot enough to melt regular steel much less, stuff that is covered in fire proof insulation.</p>

<p>IF, and its a big if, any extremely localized spot in the towers was actually able to reach a temperature hot enough to melt the steel we would see partial failures, slumping floors etc in very very localized areas.</p>

<p>the fact that entire floors failed at once, and then in cascade is just absolutely absurd as it means the entirety of each of those floors were uniformly at or near the melting points of structural steel, for them to be uniformly heated that way (ie the core of the building was just as hot as the outside) is completely impossible.</p>

<p>Going to look at the nano-thermite angle too.</p>
