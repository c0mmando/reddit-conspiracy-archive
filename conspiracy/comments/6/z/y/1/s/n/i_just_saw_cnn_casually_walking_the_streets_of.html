       Just recently I was at home skimming through the TV channels and then I get to CNN, at the moment wolf Blitzer is talking about the missile crisis then all of a sudden he passes it on to a correspondent on the ground in Pyongyang and he is casually walking the streets of the city talking about the crisis and the issues with the Government and how it's building more to prove it can drive economic growth pointing to a few things here and there on the street. Then he starts talking to North Koreans about the crisis and asking them what they think. They gave your typical responses that they are not afraid of America, and that they believe in the Kim family but still. Then the last scene was the correspondent giving his closing remarks in like CNN's press room in North Korea.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, anyone who knows anything about North Korea knows that they do not allow free access to the country, you are only allowed a predefined tour route with strict control. But some way CNN had a reporter walking the streets of Pyongyang talking about the issues of the Government and the missile crisis,
       <em>
        and
       </em>
       interviewing North Koreans about the situation and what they think about it. Like how could they pass that off as legit because they made no effort to say that they got permission from the government to do it.

       I highly doubt they'd let CNN in ... kings of deception.

       Who's to say theyre not in some city in a "little Korea" somewhere.

       I find it hard to believe out of the handful of people they let in every year, two of them would be CNN folk filming propaganda. Smells like a Korean Armpit if you ask me.

       WTF are you talking about?
      </p>
      <p>
       In the recent months, many media outlets have been let into the country, it's part of Kims scare tactics.
      </p>
      <p>
       Examples:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmoj7pBQEYs&amp;amp;t=20s">

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       .. and so on. Many people are let in every year, not just media. Look at guys like Warmbier.

       Why would they single them out ?

      <p>
       You must understand that the whole "CNN is fake" meme is only really alive in the alt-right community.

       They singled them out in the Trump as an easy victim in their strategy to discredit all media that is saying something against them (= the mainstream media).

       I guess where it's not my country and I know of the fake shit they get on with, that I would assume a power in another country would realize the same ... from green screens, to fake rescues ... I would just feel that they would be frowned upon, and maybe I'm wrong, which is fine too... it just seems like now would be an odd time for western media.

       And don't get me wrong, I do believe that they sometimes are not honest with the viewers.
      </p>
      <p>
       I just see no evidence right now that they do it for reasons other than trying to be/stay #1 in the ratings. So i believe the core of their news is true, however they try to get the maximum out of it and might do silly things here and there. To get ratings or for company internal dick comparison matters.
      </p>

       In the countries where I have friends, only the most informed people (redditors for example) know about the fakery memes.

       Yeah crazy isn't it. There's a good documentary called The Propaganda Game. It'll give you a good feel for what journalists are force-fed by the regime. There's very little journalism to be done as you're guided around as if you were a tourist. It's very rare to see the true side of North Korea.

       What is so amazing? There have been news agencies before they are followed 24/7, interact with vetted locals, and have their itineraries approved beforehand.

       I get that. And most likely a channel with number 1 ratings or close on that would be a good way to spread the citizens message.
