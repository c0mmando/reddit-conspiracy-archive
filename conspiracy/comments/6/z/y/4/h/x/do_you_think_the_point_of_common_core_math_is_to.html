Another video was of Allen Greenspan speaking of how Fed policy is not just economics and is more social engineering.  This was Harvard elite around 100 years ago.  With advancements in Psychology, Sociology ,Public Relations, imagine what mechanisms there are today.  My first thought is common core.</p>

<p>Social multiple choice had been hard, although social had a socialist biased multiple choice tests are not simple memorization but had a source book that was used for every question, I always did well on the multiple choice, usually a good 20 points above the class average.

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s a lot to be learned from activities with no rules. It might bore them at first but try to spark an interest in something artistic like painting or music. This is hugely important because everything in school revolves around regurgitating memorized material and/ or social conditioning propaganda. Critical thinking means to think for oneself, unbound by the restrictions of others&#39; beliefs/ opinions. They&#39;ll never learn this if all they are taught is to repeat what others tell them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m assuming your kid is still young since you&#39;re reading to him/her. Some options:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Expose your kid to simple math and science in the every day. Paying for something at the store? Have them help you figure out how much money you need to use or how much change to get back. When they&#39;re older, have them help you figure out tips at restaurants. They&#39;ll see the reasons why math is used, and they might find they&#39;re own intuitive sense of how it works.</p></li>
<li><p>Explore nature with them. Go for hikes. Examine the plants and animals you encounter. Try to figure out the names for things you see. Explain why people think certain things behave in certain ways. Science began as philosophy, and philosophy began with people trying to explain the natural world.</p></li>
<li><p>Don&#39;t hand you kid answers for questions they might have. Help them, but let them try to figure out their own questions for themselves.</p></li>
<li><p>For when they&#39;re older, it&#39;s actually not too hard to learn different maths from self-reading books. You&#39;d have to be somewhat involved in this though...quizzing them informally or formally about the concepts they read about.</p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>If you&#39;re looking for a specific suggestion for a math curriculum, Singapore Math is fantastic. It is compliant with Common Core standards. I&#39;ve used it to homeschool my kids. Gave them a solid foundation for higher math - both kids are years ahead of their public school peers in math.</p>

<p>I worked in civil engineering as a drafter/designer for over a decade before I used Singapore Math with my kids. My math skills were adequate, but I never thought of myself as a &quot;math person.&quot; My Bachelor&#39;s is in English, actually. Just working through the course with them, well, my mental math skills were very much improved. Having learned math &quot;the old way&quot; in the late &#39;70s-early &#39;80s (algorithmically), and then re-learned it the &quot;Common Core way,&quot; I can attest the new way promotes both critical and divergent thinking far more effectively. </p>

<p>The best piece of advice I can give as far as educating your children in math is to pick a math curriculum and see it through beginning to end, making sure the kid &quot;gets&quot; each step. Too often, a kid in public school will not grok a math concept that&#39;s foundational to the next one, and they start to get lost. Individualized education ensures that doesn&#39;t happen.</p>

<p>I&#39;m passionate about enabling other parents to educate their children outside of the public school system. If you have any questions, feel free to ask. I would be happy to help (and I&#39;m not selling anything).</p>

<p>I disagree. The US public educational system that was devised in the 19th century was based on the Prussian model and was intended to provide socialization and a broad education for the next generation of American citizens -- and it was successful for a long time, exemplified by the &quot;Greatest Generation,&quot; most of whom were educated in public schools. </p>

<p>Common Core only came about in the early 2000s with the Bush administration. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>As an outsider from the US, can you explain what makes common core math education different from &quot;proper&quot; math education?</p>

<p>I think most of todays curriculum is designed to turn people into smart idiots, while most of todays TV is designed to turn people into dumb idiots. </p>

<p>Math (as well as languages/linguistics) in general seems to be the exception to me though. Both of those are disciplines that teach higher level thinking. Critical thinking is just that combined with a critical attitude which can be taught or learned independently. Certainly nobody at school encourages you to be critical. The school itself would be your first subject of criticism for sure.</p>

<p>What about common core maths specificially do you think decreases critical thinking?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To me (dumb american) basic math teaches you to think inside the box (linear structure, rules to follow) when critical thinking is done out of the box (no rules, no structure).</p>

<p>Sure, math can help you to understand things a little better which can help with critical thought but that&#39;s beside the point. School, to me, was all about memorizing structure and emulating it. Very little emphasis was placed on originality or creativity (the other half of our brain that no one cares about).</p>

<p>Our brain is, just like anything, dualistic. As I see it, one side caters to reason and logic (math, language etc) and the other is for expression and creation (art etc). Only when the two sides combine their power (with additional help from a non-crystallized pineal gland), critical thought can occur.</p>

<p>If schools are teaching structure and logic over expression (which from my experience - they are), then half of our brain is being wasted and causing a mental imbalance.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why do you think there are no rules and no structure outside of the box? </p>

<p>To my mind, critical thinking can&#39;t exist without a scaffolding of concrete rules and structures as fixed reference points of truth. Mathematics is probably the &quot;truest&quot; expression of reality there is. 2+2<strong>=</strong>4! There&#39;s something very profound in that alone. </p>

<p>I do agree that a balance as you describe is something we should generally strive for. I always think about Feynmann&#39;s obsession with his Bongos or Einstein riding his bike everywhere.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are rules and there are no rules. Both are true because everything is a duality. There is always a polar opposite to anything material or abstract. One can&#39;t exist without the other. Without chaos, no rules or structure can be created. They both exist as one thing. Our mind is the same. One side strives for disorder and chaos and the other side makes rules to follow by. 2+2=4 only because someone created the characters to which amounts can be added. Without the numbers there would be no difference, they only provide a structure for basic understanding.</p>

<p>Simply learning the structure shouldn&#39;t be the sole focus because ultimately the characters are useless until they are used to <em>create,</em> or further progress as a species for the benefit of all life (gain knowledge or understanding of the chaos), or used to destroy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with your overall view, but very much disagree with the details. For one, I think you&#39;re giving duality too much power. It&#39;s certainly a core structure, i think you got that right (yin and yang, order and chaos, light and dark) but unity is a reality also. What is christ consciousness if not a turning away from duality and an embrace of unity? </p>

<p>You also seem to be taking the concept of brain hemispheres a tad too literally. Studies have shown that the two hemispheres can have very different qualities and even separate personalities under the right pathologies. It would be taking the distinction too far though to say that one desires order and the other chaos, or that one side is purely analytical and the other purely creative. The reality is certainly more varied than that.</p>

<p>You&#39;re also wrong about the importance of the characters we use in mathematics. 2+2=4 is true whether we use these characters or Roman numerals or physical objects. The rules and structures are there with or without us. Mathematics is not a human invention, only its expressions are.</p>

<p>But you&#39;re obviously right that it&#39;s important how you apply mathematics. Honestly though, that&#39;s still on you and not your school to decide. The schools should tell you how to think (the correct and true rules and structures of the world within and without ourselves) and not what to do with it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree. I was prepared to hate the common core math curricula, but then I saw how my kid was introduced to concepts like variables very early on. There&#39;s also an emphasis on breaking down and solving word problems. Stuff I didn&#39;t get until much later. Now my kid is taking fairly advanced algebra in the 8th grade and he&#39;s handling it with ease. I think some of the common core hate is just politically motivated. I also happen to know many wonderful teachers who feel ok with it. No child left behind on the other hand has been a fucking disaster. The real conspiracy in education is the move to cut funding while we dump trillions into killing poor people around the globe.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Common Core isn&#39;t the curriculum, like others keep saying. CC is technically just the standards that need to be met. What the student gets taught to met those standards is the curriculum, which is made up mostly by book publishers, and the like, who make pre-made curriculum products that get sold to schools/teachers.  Teachers have their own discretion to teach that curriculum. </p>

<p>The problem that CC is trying to fix is that people don&#39;t have strong grasp of why we do the things we do with math. Especially when they get to college and getting into science areas. All the adults right now have memorized little mnemonics to help do math (like Please Excuse My Dear Aunt Sally for PEMDAS to remember the order of operations). CC tries to set deeper math goals so kids will start understanding the &#39;why&#39; rather than just memorizing the &#39;how&#39;.</p>

<p>Parents, and teachers, hate it because it&#39;s setup so differently than what they were taught. Kids come home with weird math and the parents can&#39;t really help. The teachers can&#39;t really explain it well because they haven&#39;t reprogrammed their own minds to grasp it. I understand the higher up educators intentions (the worked on this for years with a bunch of council groups from the states), but they really dropped the ball helping out the lower teachers to get in to it properly. Especially when people started complaining and they got kind of snotty about it saying they were just putting in better standards and it&#39;s better, and still seemed to just leave everyone flapping in the wind. The most I heard from the teachers in my home district was they went to like a couple day seminar to learn the new way and that was it.</p>

<p>The conspiracy is that the architects of Common Core have explicitly stated that their goal was to devise a curriculum so advanced as to put religious schools out of business.</p>

<p>When taught properly, it puts kids two years ahead in math.</p>

<p>The whole thing backfired because, as you say, teachers and parents are themselves deficient in math and are incapable of teaching it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It also backfired because the kids who were caught in the middle of the transition got totally lost. There was no continuity in the sequence, and particularly in math - that continuity is everything. One skill builds upon the next. There are several grade levels that basically got torn away from the old algorithmic way of learning math and shoved into the new more concrete way during the transition, with teachers who had no idea how to teach the new way, and they got left behind with huge, confusing gaps in their math education. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What&#39;s also a shame is that NEW teachers have only been taught Common Core to teach, so that they are in some ways at a bigger advantage than established teachers who have taught something different their entire careers.

It&#39;d be a good thing if people weren&#39;t so angry and resistant and if the companies pushing it didn&#39;t focus on standardized testing and the big money that comes from those.

    <div class="md"><p>There are many studies which show the proficiency of and ability to perform Mathematics has decreased, it&#39;s not unreasonable to see the correlation with the implementation of common core math standards.  As far as the tests - you would have to take tests that were completed before say 1989, and compare them with tests completed contemporarily.  In doing so, one will find that the mathematical problems themselves have been dumbed down, meaning there is a lower level of challenge - for example math that used to be taught in middle school is pushed up to high school - so any apples to apples comparison proves difficult: but the results of failure from the introduction of common core math standards speaks for itself.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is a damned shame that the math scores of white students&#39; in the USA are plummeting - common core is holistically a failure.  As I have pointed out elsewhere, it is even more a problem that it appears because the math itself that they are testing has been dumbed down to lower levels.  Other nations are way ahead, and teaching higher level math in lower grade levels - to a much higher proficiency - so it seems clear that common core math is a failure. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well if you look at the 2015 NAEP report card there is a reduction in math and reading proficiency.</p>

<p>Also there is this: <a href="http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1980/12/21/page/4/article/it-adds-up-old-textbooks-are-best-in-math-education/index.html">http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1980/12/21/page/4/article/it-adds-up-old-textbooks-are-best-in-math-education/index.html</a>  which shows that teaching from older mathematics books greatly increased student mathematical proficiency.</p>

<p>Also there is this: <a href="https://edsource.org/2014/common-core-standards-bring-dramatic-changes-to-elementary-school-math-2/63665">https://edsource.org/2014/common-core-standards-bring-dramatic-changes-to-elementary-school-math-2/63665</a> which shows how students who had to learn their multiplication tables in the 2nd grade now learn them in the 3rd grade - and also that geometry standards are now less about identifying and measuring shapes and more about building and deconstructing them - and 1st grade students having long been required to “commit to memory” all the ways of adding two numbers to come up with sums between two and 20 where the Common Core standards that they commit the equations to memory has been moved to the 2nd grade.  This dumbing down and pushing of math standards to a higher grade has gone on through all the levels K-12 - the problems themselves are easier, and the methods of instruction of the math in itself is inferior.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It seems like it would be taught this way to help students grasp at an early age that numbers can be broken into their smaller parts in order to make problems easier to solve. While it may not be the most effective way to teach addition (which is debatable) down the line it makes understanding multiplication easier as well as when you get into algebra and calculus. In these subjects it helps. I don&#39;t really see how something like this would support the OPs claim that it has been changed to make kids dumber.

    <div class="md"><p>First off, people need to understand the difference between the common core teaching curriculum and the common core required standardized testing.  The standardized testing is bullshit to make educational material companies wealthy, they pushed for it at the state and federal level because that&#39;s where the money is: government contracts.  </p>

<p>The teaching curriculum is just a different way of teaching the same math.  Instead of spending weeks memorizing times tables so you can recall hundreds of equations to solve a problem.  Instead, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVYbcps23Tw">they just came up with a new way to visualize</a> the multiplication.  </p>

<p>Often you get people like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4DunVIqk_s">this woman</a> who is very mad about the perceived stupidity of common core, when she should actually be mad at the teacher for grading so harshly.  In reality, that teacher should have given the student credit if the problem was simply asking to solve 5x3.  If the questions was asking for the problem to be broken down into an addition problem that reads the same as the multiplication problem, then the student should get less credit, because that wasn&#39;t achieved by saying 5+5+5=15.  </p>

<p>Basically, it&#39;s not always about the final answer, it&#39;s about how you arrived at the answer.  If you get the right answer the wrong way, that may work once, but it won&#39;t work again.  </p>

<p>Common core math tries to teach kids to do math the way we do math quickly in our heads as adults, by breaking apart difficult numbers into more simple equations and reassembling them to the correct answer.  If you look at a lesson completely out of context, it won&#39;t make sense.  But isn&#39;t that true of anything?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Does it?  Or does it feel that way because you learned it a different way and need to relearn it in order to teach it to your child?  </p>

<p>For instance, if a child can add by first grade, subtract by second, multiply by third, and divide by fourth, then has the method slowed them down?  Because kids aren&#39;t learning less math.  First graders are still learning how to add, but they&#39;re <em>also</em> learning how to think about adding, about what&#39;s actually happening when two numbers are added together.  They&#39;re teaching students that numbers are just equations themselves, combinations of other numbers.  Numbers are flexible.  Instead of just learning &quot;You do this and get this&quot;.</p>

<p>If you want to look at the history of public education, it was created as a means to free adults up to work and to educate their children into becoming good workers.  Modern education is trying to undo that and create critical thinkers, which is exactly what you claim isn&#39;t happening.  The way we were taught math was as a linear operation, there is only one way to do something and you must do it this way.  The way they&#39;re teaching now, they&#39;re teaching children to actually <em>see</em> what they&#39;re doing and think about how they can <em>solve</em> it, not how they can run it through the number-mill and get the one true answer.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So you just want kids worked harder?  To what end?  </p>

<p>Look, some students may be able to grasp and excel young, but that doesn&#39;t mean <strong>all</strong> students will. You need to create a curriculum that can challenge the quickest mind and still educate the slowest mind.  Just because one kid is doing square roots, doesn&#39;t mean everyone in the class is grasping that.  I personally work with pre-schooler students and haven&#39;t ever seen evidence of third or fourth graders doing algebra or square roots, most struggle to write their own first name, counting to twenty can be a challenge.  </p>

<p>So to expect every one of those children to hit the same upper limits is unfair.  </p>

<p>This is where parenting comes in, advanced children will need as much parental help as those children left behind.  Public schools have far too much on their plate educating hundreds of kids per school to not have some slip through the cracks.  So children who are advanced are often left behind because &quot;they are smart, they don&#39;t need my help&quot;.  The work is easy, they aren&#39;t challenged, they finish early and get in trouble.  Vicious cycle for a smart kid.  </p>

<p>So the solution isn&#39;t to be mad at the curriculum, it&#39;s to give each child the help <strong>they need</strong> at home so that they continue to thrive.  Common Core isn&#39;t evil, it&#39;s a set of learning standards, a set of bars to pass at certain times to make sure a student is on track.  If they&#39;re crossing those bars too early, they&#39;ll need extra help just as if they cross too late.  Each child is an individual and will require individual education to really thrive, Common Core just gets the ball rolling and helps compare each student to the &quot;average&quot;.  <a href="http://www.corestandards.org/Math/Practice/">You can see the standards themselves here</a>.</p>

<p>Basically, that&#39;s great that your child is succeeding, but don&#39;t blame the standards for leaving him/her behind.  The standards are just there to help compare achievement and help keep everyone moving in the right direction.  This way you know that your child is advanced and you know what help you can administer to make sure he/she isn&#39;t left behind due to this.  </p>

<p>I have a friend who&#39;s an elementary school teacher. Being in a big city, people tend to transfer in and out a lot. He&#39;s told me how annoying it is when students come in from schools that don&#39;t use common core. Part of the purpose is to standardize the curriculum so everyone&#39;s at least on a certain level by a certain point. His kids will be past long division while a new kid comes in who hasn&#39;t even reached that yet. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I never thought the &quot;paths&quot; I used to learn arithmetic and algebra were special (and they aren&#39;t really, I&#39;m probably as average a math student as they come). Well, if you&#39;ve spent anytime in public education you notice that not all kids are &quot;self-starters&quot; with the ability to think abstractly enough to teach themselves personal shortcuts or tricks. Common core helps facilitate individual thought and i personally think common core was created to raise the average IQ levels of minorities. Im sorry but I taught 5th grade math years ago and the performing differences between races is clearly evident, unless you have your head up your ass. There are plenty of sociological explanations for the performance disparities but I think common core is an experiment at its heart.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Isn&#39;t common core actually just better?</p>

<p>I was always the fastest and best in my math classes and I intuitively always did it the common core way and never understood the controversy surrounding it.</p>

<p>Like if you want to add 7 + 7 that&#39;s the same as first adding 3 to 7 to get 10 and then adding the remaining 4. Isn&#39;t that common core? That seems like the logical way to solve it to me.</p>

<p>Or if you want to multiply 49 * 7 that&#39;s the same as multiplying 50 * 7 and subtracting 7 again. 50<em>7-7 is much easier and faster to calculate than 49</em>7</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, I had someone describe to me that CC tries to teach students to do math the way adults do it in their heads, using shorthand rounding to easier numbers to reach the end results. </p>

<p>It&#39;s a shame that adults who haven&#39;t been taught that way look at CC math and just shout, &quot;This is stupid, did it my way!&quot; because they refuse to learn something new. </p>

<p>The assumptions that hundreds and thousands of teachers are just trying to &quot;keep kids dumb&quot; is so insulting. Teachers don&#39;t go into teaching because they want to hurt children&#39;s chances. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It seems like it would be taught this way to help students grasp at an early age that numbers can be broken into their smaller parts in order to make problems easier to solve. While it may not be the most effective way to teach addition (which is debatable) down the line it makes understanding multiplication easier as well as when you get into algebra and calculus. In these subjects it helps. I don&#39;t really see how something like this would support the OPs claim that it has been changed to make kids dumber.  In my previous statement I am not saying that you made that claim. I was just making a general statement.</p>
