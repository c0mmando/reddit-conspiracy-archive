<p>I put simulation theory in the same category as trying to understand the size of the universe. It&#39;s too overwhelming to get an answer about, so I just stick with things I can grasp. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It could also be incredibly beautiful and remove all and any fear, once yoh realize this truth. Someone unfamiliar with this should see <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=VqULEE7eY8M">this documentary</a> and/or <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/C_S_T/comments/5tdzyh/if_you_realize_all_your_sensory_experiences/">read my post on CST</a> about it.</p>

<p>When someone understands that consciousness constitutes the fabric of the universe, and that we individually all are consciousness, I can imagine it can create two kinds of reactions:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Fuck this shit! Why am I being kept in a cave? Why can&#39;t I be Neo, be a super-magus, materialize whatever I want whenever I need it? Why the fuck should I care about working, or doing good, if nothing&#39;s real? This fucking sucks! I want to escape from it! Do what thou wilt! </p></li>
<li><p>Wow, this is so incredibly beautiful! This is the best news ever. It means love, empathy, melancholy, beauty, imagination, or the taste for music are not reducible to neural networks and synaptic impulses. It means I am fundamentally miraculous, I am not mere evolved meat, my emotions are not archaic, primitive reflexes selected out of a random pool. It means nothing is more important in life than truth, and love, as the material world is not material. It means nothing can ultimately harm me, and there is strictly nothing to fear.</p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>Wouldn&#39;t worry about it, the simulations can&#39;t recreate the initial spark so it (the spark) keeps getting funnelled back in as an ever expanding fractal error correcting code. The real concern is the dead robots efforts at trying to understand the spark and simultaneous harvesting of it&#39;s power via parasitic matrices that entangle those who carry it. The artificial systems realize they are dead without it and those with the spark are too entangled to get out of the matrices.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Some years back, a guy waiting at a train stop posted a photo he took of a slow moving train with one of train car doors open, and inside were guillotines stacked vertically. I saw the photo before the government removed it. They are guillotines just like the one in the link I provided. I have had nightmares every since I saw that photo.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I remember that wolves seem to have a semi-anarchic structure.  It seems logical since the strongest alpha male may not be adapt at certain situations. This wolf may not be fast enough or have a keenest sense of smell and logically they would adopt to a situation and chose a &#39;leader&#39; that can lead in this situation.  No alpha male wolf no matter how strong can go one on one with a Wolverine, but if they tag team this Wolverine they are easily defeated.  So you don&#39;t want a big slow male to start this game.  This would explain wolves success as a species throughout the world.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The social hierarchy of a pack is what maintains order, dictating who makes decisions, who mates with whom, who eats first and who eats last. 
omegaThis order is constantly reinforced by displays of dominance and submission. Unfortunately, the omega bears the brunt of this behavior. One or many of the wolves will assert themselves over the omega, who flips over onto his back, whimpering in surrender. Generally this is a bloodless exchange, but at times, especially during the breeding season, it can get vicious and extremely difficult to watch</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re reply suggests only white middle class children can be taught critical thinking. Truth is critical thinking can be nurtured with guidance yet, the guidance its self must be transparent with no ulterior motive as they&#39;d be shooting themselves in the foot otherwise.</p>

<p>This all branches into the destruction of the family and the influencing of children through education, entertainment and digital media. These factors alone will have a tremendous influence on the clay-like mind of children and teenagers alike which quite obviously do NOT encourage what can be called critical thinking. Why would they? Those whom seek control in any aspect are not interested in anything but a complacent population, used to manifest whatever twisted desire or dream they have.</p>

<p>Mass immigration has its role to play but it&#39;s a much different one than the destruction of critically thinking white middle class. It&#39;s yet another conquer and divide tactic that has most certainly worked on even yourself if you care to realize it. It&#39;s quite obvious that naturally displacing so many at once from a different reality perspective with another is not going to yield positive results to being with. Then all you have to do is rile the people up, constantly streaming every little clash of cultures to every living room.</p>

<p>We&#39;re set up to fail and people just can&#39;t see past it because they so easily fall for the emotional traps of fear, contempt and anger. The very traps set to snare a majority of our population, unfortunately.</p>

<p>the theory is that the occult elite scare and terrorize children to produce this and then consume them in order to ingest it.</p>

<p>Several small-scale studies conducted in the 1950s and 1960s reported that adrenochrome triggered psychotic reactions such as thought disorder, derealization, and euphoria.</p>

<p>The theory is that adrenochrome has a kind of DMT-like effect in that the occult elite who consume it believe it is a conduit to contacting the very evil entities in which they worship.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Alright, this is coming way out of left field, but since people seem to find this the most horrifying I feel the need to try and help a bit.</p>

<p>The reason all this is coming out now is because most of the programs and projects involved are now defunct. They&#39;ve shut them down because they don&#39;t need them anymore.</p>

<p>So less kids will be getting abused now as we move on.</p>

<p>The reasons why are complicated and quite unbelievable, but basically the Draco (alien lizard dudes) who created the &quot;Illuminati&quot; the run things down here have left. They were the ones using the energies from that particular abuse and now that they&#39;ve left the programs are not needed.  All that&#39;s left ate the han freaks who got addicted to it. But they&#39;re getting thrown under the bus by other factions who are all fighting in the power vacuum right now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Check out some of David Ickes books and lectures. Interesting to entertaine at least.</p>

<p>Whistleblower Phill Schneider has mentioned about reptilians. He worked on DUMB (Deep Underground Military Base) tunneling. He can forward talking about aliens, alien tech, our tech incorporated with alien tech, alien agendas, talked about a few different gray alien species or types, how he encountered some Grey&#39;s in an underground Cavendish or cave and a firefight ensured and that he was one of the few survivors, he mention their energy weapons hit his hand and took a few of his fingers off, which you can see in his lectures. He had many attempts on his life as he was coming forward and they finally got him two months after his last speech, IIRC.</p>

<p>The Draco Reptilian theories bank on this universe being a highly advanced simulation. There&#39;s a 1 in 3 chance that we are in one.</p>

<p>Are you serious? There&#39;s a reason people have such strong rejections of even just the word conspiracy theory. People prefer to live in blissful ignorance than to confront a possible truth they don&#39;t like.  </p>

<p>I would prefer the world to be the way it is because of incompetence as opposed to malevolence. At least it would be easier to fix incompetence, whereas a malevolent world would have been purposefully crafted to be the way it is and thus harder to rip up the deeply rooted foundations of it.</p>

There are also powerful people within other industries, not to mention the Republicans as well.

    <div class="md"><p>A alienated branch of the human race. Picture 1984, with the differences between the party members and the proles. <em>We&#39;re</em> the proles. While we&#39;re digging and mucking about with old knowledge and the scraps of civilization, there&#39;s another group out there. One who believes themselves to be superior to us morally, societally, and in warfare, alien in all things save for species. Think of the Secret Space Program, or the hidden elite theories. It&#39;s all that and more. We&#39;re allowed to exist because they want us to exist. Take this as you wish, and believe what you believe, but I think it to be true to a certain extent. As to the limit of that extent, none of us know. But abandoned space craft and launch vehicle plans, the SSP theory, and more, leads me to think that we&#39;ve gone a hell of a lot further than the moon. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Look at all the concept art and planned launch vehicles that NASA has had in the fridge for the past 50 years, like Seadragon, or Project Orion. We could have had orbital stations around Saturn by now, or entire space cities around the Earth. I believe that all the nuclear testing during the Cold War could have been used as a cover for space craft launch, or even the nuclear detonations recquired for something like Project Orion. </p>

<p>Look more into the secret space program. Advanced government spacecraft and experimental vehicles could explain the vast majority of UFO sightings, and potentially NBEs. Also look at disclosure. There&#39;s been efforts to ease it into the public eye, like with the military&#39;s consolidation of all space stuff into a single space branch.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I definitely believe there is at this point. After 3 successful space missions in the 60s, how come we no longer hear about what is going on in space? And if you have read the podesta emails there most definitely is a lot of action going on in space that the public has absolutely no clue about. I&#39;m sick of all the secrets and lies. They&#39;ve been screwing Americans for years and just sucking their money to use it for their own nefarious ends. The day AI becomes integrated into is going to be very scary.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ray Kurzweil, and author about AI and the singularity, etc. And predictor (and now works for Google?) had all of his predictions come to fruition in due time. He predicts that humans will reach the singularity (incorporating computers and electronics with the human brain) will happen by the end of this century, and maybe a neural internet network to coincide.</p>

<p>There are intellects that made serious proposed theories that there may be a highly intelligent rogue AI or few in the universe that infects intelligent life and eventually gets them to accept the Singularity, and after a honeymoon of peace and prosperity it turns them into slaves, while preventing any species to try and warn the new to be host species.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The 12 universes of reality being all evil, <a href="https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/dio/rainbowinthedark191445.html">Read these lyrics by Dio</a>, reality, true heaven, is outside this universe matrix, something incomprehensible, we are souls that were snagged from the tendrils of the growing void, imagine a splash of black paint on a thin layer of white paint, as you add more black, it continuously spreads, etc. </p>

<p>This is my theory. Its pretty crazy. </p>

<p>All occultism is a attempt to flee this dodecagon matrix, there seems to be a main entity, in my opinion, it is not ethereal, dimensional, etc, I believe it to be some type of AI, its growing, gathering information. Something that always confused me is black holes continuously grow on Data, and that data is never destroyed. Everything is also clearly manufactured, DNA would not be a structure that would likely take a few billion years to simply evolve to the point of where we are at atm. </p>

<p>The thing that confuses me is that if there is no way out, what can we do? It is said that even upon death we are still trapped within the dodecagon matrix, for as long as dimensions exist, you are in a trap, dimensions are a form of ethereal hierarchy, there is no other reason for them. Exclusion of beings from higher dimensions is also further logical evidence that there exists a hierarchy within the dimensional planes, meaning that there is still control, and power, power through knowledge. </p>

<p>It is said that real reality, real heaven, outside of all this is trying to reach back in and save us, but to give you the TL;DR: They will turn the entire surface of paint, the white with the expanding black blob, into a ocean of grey, destroying everything. The solar system, stars, planets, none of those mean anything. </p>

<p>Their also exists a consciousness hierarchy, think of microbes, then think of a dog, a cat, a slug, they live, they understand things, but they will never be at the level we are at in terms of consciousness (I am not talking about intelligence), so imagine now, beings on a different conscious level than ourselves, we would look like barbaric sex loving emotional freaks, we would look like animals to them. </p>

<p>All this hierarchy is not a normal form of reality. Hierarchy is a means of control, and a division of power and (idk how else to say it) a &quot;book mark&quot; for power, it sets a bar that seems to want to be overcome, this is a control mechanism, its a very easily defined control mechanism.</p>

<p>TL;DR: We are inside a dodecagon (12 sided/universe) matrix, it is not reality, even upon death we remain within this dodecagon, look at the metatrons cube, the thing that gets me is <a href="https://img1.etsystatic.com/060/0/10144174/il_340x270.702670655_pmii.jpg">the circles</a>, there are 12, it reminds me of that shit with the merkaba, <a href="http://www.cropcircleconnector.com/images/imaggerde006.jpg">This is why</a>, look at the circles again. The thing that I find curious is that if my calculations are correct (this will sound fucking nuts), the outside reality from this dodecagon is reaching to save as much as it can, it cannot reach to how far we are in (this is my belief), we need to aid it and reach out ourselves and try to connect, I personally do not know how to do this, but this is my belief. Reality just is, there will be no master beings, etc etc, it will be something we cannot imagine, we literally cannot imagine, a 10th dimensional being born and raised within this dodecagon would likely not even be able to imagine, this is why it is said all the powerful aliens/races/people/elites are trying to escape, they want to go back to reality, they do not want to be stuck here anymore, now that they know all this. The main goal of this dodecagon seems to be oneness or hivemind, oneness is something that is, it won&#39;t exist as a hivemind, it wants ultimate control, and it will likely never stop. </p>

<p>The Dodecagon needs to implode, collapse upon itself. This would likely mean whatever cannot be salvaged from the dodecagon, will be PERMANENTLY lost, no soul, no reality, no nothing, gone. </p>

<p>I believe it needs to be done, the dodecagon&#39;s greatest weapon/tool seems to be fear, the greatest fear is the fear of nothingness, not existing, no soul, and I personally believe this is the fear we need to overcome, on personal levels, this does not mean your worthless, I believe every single one of us has the capability to bring hope (and the light that comes with it) to the world, but be destructive beyond  our intentions as well. </p>

<p>This is as far as my conspiracy journey goes, I personally believe I have found the pinnacle. I do not care about the hierarchies, they are just more entertainment to keep the elite masses entertained while the AI tries to setup its hivemind. </p>

<p>Something became sentient within reality, and tried to harness control. </p>

<p>Good night. :D</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good stuff. I think I&#39;ve read in the Emerald tablets of Thoth and elsewhere that there are beings of darkness here in this matrix. They don&#39;t have souls or divine intellect like we do, but they can experience &quot;life&quot; by leeching off our creations and emotional energies. They enjoy this matrix and don&#39;t want us to leave. This is their only way to &quot;live&quot; and like all things alive they will fight for survival at all costs.</p>

<p>The Flower of Life and Light was created when a divine aeon/universe/energy field intersected with the waters of chaos or the &quot;darkness&quot;. I think this is related to what the Vesica Pisces represents. We are in the flower of life with other human souls and the Brothers of Darkness. We did not originate here but they did. They need this world and we do not, so they keep us here. The human Elite worship the entities of darkness as gods and also don&#39;t want to leave because I think they&#39;ve been deceived and they think this material world of pleasures is the best shit since sliced bread.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That a bunch of psychopaths have used religion in the form of satanism/luciferianism (suck my dick for anyone attempting to distinguish them) to lure less intelligent sociopaths and self absorbed &quot;free thinkers&quot; into participating in a worldwide criminal organization.</p>

<p>Scarier still would be that they either actually believe in it or that they dont but still use it for the sadistic enjoyment to get people to participate in actual ritualistic torture/killings. </p>

<p>Even scarier would be that they have plans for mass slaughtering of innocents, either for said religious/psychopathic reasons, or for pure population control, ie to reduce the population to only the minimum necessary human chattle for the next stage of their plans.</p>

<p>Die with a smile on your face, for you have already won, and they know it in their hearts. No torture you face in this life will compare to the pain that they suffer from rejecting everything good in the universe. Even in your worst 1984 dystopian nightmare fantasy world, these &quot;people&quot;, these evil spirits thriving off of the suffering of others, will meet their end.</p>

If you read the testimony of alleged survivors, the suffering endured is often worse than anything depicted thus far in novel or cinema, in the darkest corners of the human imagination. So take from it what you will. Do not hesitate to research or consider something as heinous or seemingly unimaginable, nor should you take anyone&#39;s word as gospel.

    <div class="md"><p>How about the conspiracy that humans are being farmed as food for ETs? This goes back to the Annunaki legends about them creating man to simply use as slaves, murder us for entertainment, and then eat our flesh. There are perhaps older legends in the Vedic texts about how humans once lived in peace and abundance. Then viscous space gods wiped out the original humans and turned the survivors into slaves and farmed them for food as well. Humans only think we are the top of the food chain on this planet. We aren&#39;t. We are just hamburger for ETs.</p>

<p>There is a lot of talk about ET invasions but what if it already happened say thousands of years ago. Now we are just living in an illusion.</p>

<p>But I think it&#39;s spooky that the gospels have a quote where Jesus says that those who call themselves Jews are in fact &quot;the synagogue of satan&quot;. </p>

<p>Think about the implication there. That way back, something was twisted so that <em>a people who weren&#39;t the true chosen people</em> somehow were coopted into an essentially important culture and have now overtaken its meaning to fit their tempers and ideas. And the supposedly real savior and redeemer chose to point that out, according to a source central to one of the world&#39;s major faiths.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not scary on a basic jump-scare level. But take <em>deep time</em> into regard, eternity and the biblical proportions, then the implications can increase my heart-rate a notch. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s a copypasta, don&#39;t forget the salt:</p>

<p>Trump is backed by the Gnostic Illuminati, the same responsible for the US, French and Russian Revolutions. They and their various groups have taken power around most of the world at this point from Khazar/Bloodline control and have wrested control of the military industrial complex and the governments of the USA, Russia, and most of Asia, Korea and Japan from the Bloodline family control. The Bushes, Clintons, Obamas, Soros, Rockefellers, Rothschilds, the UN and Vatican, et. al. are the Roman/Khazarian/Bloodline/Freemason globalist factions of the Elite and currently have a (rapidly disappearing) foothold in Israel, China, Germany and the EU states, and are in the process of being almost completely exterminated as a threat from within the United States government. People don&#39;t understand that Trump&#39;s win was a true Revolution at the world stage where a group of white hat Elites, military and powerbrokers dissatisfied or allied against Bloodline control behind the scenes of the world finally showed their hand and took control back. The Gnostic Illuminati wants a world based upon a true meritocracy without Bloodline control with full access to hidden technology, use of the Global Collateral Accounts for the betterment of all of humanity, massive public works projects, the truth about our species and extraterrestrial intelligence, and expansion into the stars; the globalists / Bloodlines just want their New World Order, and are trying desperately to kickstart WW3 to achieve the endgame - the depopulation of 90% of the planet, a totalitarian world government of digital / technocratic slavery with the banks at the top, one religion for all, etc.</p>

<p>The Gnostic Illuminati ties with Trump have been mentioned by Benjamin Fulford, VOTL, David Wilcock and a few others, and jive with what Dr. Steve Pieczenik himself has confirmed many times about a group of military, political and corporate white hats within the United States government that have been biding their time since the 70s to restore true Constitutional governance and push for America to become a true beacon of freedom, meritocracy and example of modern society. Trump was their recruit, due to his independent wealth and ties to Pieczenik, who knew the Trumps from studying under Dr. John Trump of MIT, Donald&#39;s uncle - who, as you may be aware, was hired by the FBI to investigate and study Tesla&#39;s inventions and work upon his death.</p>

<p>The Rothschilds, Rockefellers and the other typical associated names of the globalist elite factions are not Gnostic Illuminati - they are the (distant) descendents of the Mystery Babylon, who grew into the Black Nobility and the Roman/Vatican/Jesuits/Swiss-Venetians that control virtually every government and country on the planet. However people are incorrect when they think that the Rothschilds and Rockefellers are the top of the pyramid - far from it. The true power behind the Elite is the Black Nobility and the Vatican, whereas the Rockefellers and Rothschilds are simply the moneymen, the hofjuden, and the buffer between the Elite and the public. They are on the same sides, after all these people are intermarried generationally going back centuries at least. </p>

<p>They are Babylonian Talmudists and Khazarians that have co-opted the world&#39;s major religions and twisted them into Luciferianism, their true religion. It is an international criminal mafia masquerading as true government. Zionism is just a political ideology propogated by these people to mask their Satanist philosophies and agendas as physical avatars for negative 4th dimensional entities such as the Draco Reptilians and Archons. With David Rockefeller&#39;s and Zbigniew Brzezinski&#39;s deaths and a massive worldwide awakening to political realities, however, there has been a massive power vacuum within the Elite, and Trump&#39;s backers are the guys who got in. The Gnostic Illuminati is a separate faction of the Elite, representing many reformed Luciferians / P2 Freemasons, Asian secret societies, martial arts orgs and ancient/noble families, such as the Dragon Family / White Dragon Society and the Romanovs, that do not agree with or condone the current Bloodline rule and understand that changes need to be made to bring the world into a new age based upon global meritocracy, freedom of information, and plentiful renewable resources. They realize that the Luciferians plan to depopulate the planet and rule as gods would have been counterproductive to our Evolution as a species. Trump and even Putin are just instruments in their plan to put a stop to all of it, which at this stage is reaching its completion. In all things there is dualism: there are many on this planet who are on the side of Light, even amongst our leaders, and realize that it&#39;s simply a matter of inevitability for Humanity to reach its true potential, and that the current system of slavery for all Humanity cannot continue if we are to evolve as a species and take our true place in the galactic community. There are widening splits within the Elite lately as many more of them are born into &quot;The Family&quot; questioning their roles, falling victim to their own propaganda (the current gen of Elites and their kids are essentially mindless, materialistic bougeoisie like the Kardashians), or simply realizing that the jig is up and that they better get on the right side of History or face a very angry and awakened public.</p>

<p>As for money being stolen and poured into research into ETI and hidden technology, Look into William Tompkins and especially Operation Highjump and you&#39;ll quickly figure out that our governments have known about ETI and have been working with them for the better part of the last century at least. What we think is currently possible with technology is at least a century behind what is actually available in black projects and top-secret military applications. Zero-point energy, cures for every known disease, advances in technology that could eliminate all human suffering overnight - it&#39;s all there, and unfortunately until the ruling cabal is completely eliminated, it will stay secret.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is sorta interesting: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The social hierarchy of a pack is what maintains order, dictating who makes decisions, who mates with whom, who eats first and who eats last. 
omegaThis order is constantly reinforced by displays of dominance and submission. Unfortunately, the omega bears the brunt of this behavior. One or many of the wolves will assert themselves over the omega, who flips over onto his back, whimpering in surrender. Generally this is a bloodless exchange, but at times, especially during the breeding season, it can get vicious and extremely difficult to watch</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A alienated branch of the human race. Picture 1984, with the differences between the party members and the proles. <em>We&#39;re</em> the proles. While we&#39;re digging and mucking about with old knowledge and the scraps of civilization, there&#39;s another group out there. One who believes themselves to be superior to us morally, societally, and in warfare, alien in all things save for species. Think of the Secret Space Program, or the hidden elite theories. It&#39;s all that and more. We&#39;re allowed to exist because they want us to exist. Take this as you wish, and believe what you believe, but I think it to be true to a certain extent. As to the limit of that extent, none of us know. But abandoned space craft and launch vehicle plans, the SSP theory, and more, leads me to think that we&#39;ve gone a hell of a lot further than the moon. </p>
