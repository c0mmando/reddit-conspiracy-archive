       I believe they haven't showed up anywhere for months because my group figured out who they are. I think they're afraid that we will blurt out their name in a question session "Hey, are you guys XYZ group?"

       If they're reading this, they should know that we have not told anyone, will not tell anyone, and have extremely tight opsec.

       You can read u/freedomintensifies and u/ClosedSociety404's posts. They are both suspected of being members. You can come to u/New_American_System and discuss positive change like the Orbital Ring Space Elevator. And you can ask me anything about specifics because I may know the answer.

       I believe High Level Insider directly said Judy Wood wasn't good. If she didn't, she's not a good source.

       Much of the stuff Dr. Wood has presented verified things I had discovered on my own.

       True. But consider it has taken some time to check and verify his claims, and evaluate his intentions to ask the right questions (at least for me). I would have approached him differently, understanding and knowing what I know now.

       I would have asked him to elaborate about why he thinks 9-11 was controlled demolition.. why he thinks Dr. Judy Wood was wrong. Why they haven't done more to bring 9-11 to light to the masses. Why they haven't infiltrated the media in some way or released more information before.
      </p>
      <p>
       One of the biggest questions I have for him is - what was the true purpose of the great Giza pyramid.

      <p>
       I would also like to ask him about cold fusion.

         To me the most interesting thing about the ancients is that they had the time to stop and think carefully.
Really there isn't much remarkable about what we find other than the carefulness of it all. We could talk about how the pyramids were constructed, no magic need be invoked. It isn't the overwhelming task that it appears.
The truly neat thing about the pyramids is not their scale, it is their precision. That requires high mathematical competency which is very abstract thought. Mathematicians are some of the most careful, precise, considered thinkers on the planet. &gt;&gt;That these existed in droves necessary to do all the astrological work tells you about a society that was living luxurious lives by modern standards.
Even in a "first world" nation like America, half the population is in dire poverty. I think something like 2/3 are paycheck to paycheck, 80% can't handle an emergency bill of modest size - $5-10k.
You think about these things compared to ancient civilizations that had th time to sit around and work out thousands and thousands of years of astronomical calculations, design temples all around the world, build them, etc., and they seem rich beyond comprehension for most - at least in terms of free time. Who has the free time to build a boat and sail around the world today, never mind the years of designing a temple to build on the other side of the planet, etc.?
All that stuff about the pyramid being some magical power plant or some such is a distraction. Really what it tells you about is the magic of a society organized towards the interest of the people, the magic of living in harmony, and so on. 
The pyramid is remarkable only in the sense of the remarkable fall man has experienced in the intervening period, not so much a remarkable achievement in itself.
