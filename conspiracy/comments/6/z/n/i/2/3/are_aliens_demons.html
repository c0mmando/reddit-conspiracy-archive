The way they describe people exposed to the Ark bears a great resemblance to radiation poisoning. I don&#39;t think we can completely rule out that Moses was interpreting his interactions with aliens (or possibly progenitors). I realize this theory is way out there, but if you read the OT with aliens in mind it starts making a certain kind of sense. </p>

<p>for sure, also it&#39;s in ethiopia and its guardians die from what sounds like radiation poisoning. It (i think) was a superconductor device from the destruction of atlantis and could provide electricity back in 3000 bc would make it basically a magical artifact to people back then. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think your pet theory is really interesting-  I&#39;ve been thinking about AI a ton lately in terms of how much it might change our world within the century. </p>

<p>I remember seeing that Musk quote, also similar warnings from other big future-looking tech folks, I want to say Bill Gates or Steve Jobs and others. I&#39;m not crazy about the concept of harmful AI as a &#39;demon&#39;- I guess I know what he&#39;s saying but a demon implies matters of morality and evil, and that reinforces the (almost certainly unrealistic) Hollywood idea of malicious robots like in The Terminator or The Matrix. </p>

<p>If an AI system threatens humanity in the future, IMO good/evil will be irrelevant to it. Rather, we&#39;d be facing something we inherently can&#39;t understand because it would be exponentially more intelligent. Reminds me of Lovecraft&#39;s literary universe, where humans mistake peeks of infinite cosmic entities as gods with our values, but really they are beyond human comprehension and unconcerned with our existence. </p>

<p>I&#39;m rambling but that&#39;s what your theory reminded me of- just the idea that we will likely create something so far beyond our intellects that our concept of intelligence will change, and our situation might resemble having &#39;tapped into&#39; something. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, and all non-human entities are here to control and suppresses our souls IMO. No friendlies. The story of Jesus Christ has been manipulated so that we worship him and the sun rather than heeding his original advice found in Gnostic writings. The Elites have their own Jesus Christ, a false messiah, almost ready for the grand deception. The aliens/demons are only fearful of the false messiah&#39;s name because he is the supreme master wielding incredible power, even above Lucifer, and they are all waiting for him to return.</p>

I haven&#39;t been able to live normally for the past few years because of my &quot;trips&quot; into the occult, secret societies and &quot;ancient texts&quot;.

They are the offspring of the god of this world and they lack a soul and creative intellect.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You ever run into the &#39;others&#39; in person? Things started getting really weird for me back around Lent when I decided to experiment with some fairly extreme fasting and meditation/circadian rhythm manipulation and now every one in awhile I feel like I sometimes meet &#39;people&#39; that aren&#39;t quite what they seem. I&#39;ve seen stuff that has been 100% convinced our reality is a simulation that can be manipulated by higher level forces, but good luck having that conversation with people.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been operating on an assumption that they actually have to identify themselves if asked directly, but I&#39;ve been too scared to be the weirdo that goes around acting like people I interact with are actually non-human entities disguised as mundanes, so I usually keep quiet when I get the weird tingling otherworldy sensation that accompanies the experiences. Their appearance also seems to often coincide with weird deja-vu, &#39;matrix glitches&#39; or synchronicities. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not sure I&#39;ve encountered them walking around out in public but I&#39;m pretty sure they do. I have a strange feeling they intentionally avoid me. Maybe still trying to convince me that they don&#39;t exist at all. That wasn&#39;t the case when I was younger though as I was visited multiple times and each experience was terrifying. They can inject fear into the environment around you when they visit and it feels like you&#39;re about to die. The only &quot;thing&quot; I saw in my experiences was a blue-white shimmering humanoid that kind of teleported to the foot of my bed and then beckoned me to go with it which I did not.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>well, it&#39;s just thought that, because there are thousands of manuscripts that support the accounts of the new testament, but then a (fraction of that - 52) gnostic gospels show up, and suddenly this just discredits thousands of accounts? </p>

<p>In James M. Robinson’s comprehensive The Nag Hammadi Library, we learn that the Gnostic gospels were written by “largely unrelated and anonymous authors.” and no other credible author can say they were actually created by who they claimed they were. there&#39;s no cross reference verification that proves it, but there&#39;s tons that does the other accounts in the new testament. </p>

<p>New Testament scholar Norman Geisler writes, “The Gnostic writings were not written by the apostles, but by men in the second century (and later) pretending to use apostolic authority to advance their own teachings. Today we call this fraud and forgery.&quot;</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know about evidence, but i do know a little about likelihood, even if that sounds ironic on a conspiracy subreddit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because the Bible including the New Testament was written by TPTB and their followers. So of course it&#39;s supported by &quot;scholars&quot; worldwide, but I&#39;m not saying it&#39;s falsified either. They really are teachings from a malevolent entity known as Jehova, the god of Israel, which compels the reader to worship him even though he&#39;s pretty awful. It&#39;s also a multi-layered message just like the Kabbalah.</p>

<p>The Gnostics, in my opinion, explored the truth of what Jehova is (an Archon) and where we stand as human souls, which the Bible doesn&#39;t do. So you see there is one set of texts for (((THEM))), and others for normal human beings.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>i just want to understand your basis for believing all this. i know what you believe, but i&#39;m wondering why you believe it. </p>

<p>i understand most beliefs have an underlying basis of faith, but usually is met with some kind of logic.</p>

<p>for example, what i believe in is christianity and the bible, why i believe in it is because of archaeological evidence, thousands of manuscript correlations, eyewitness accounts, and it&#39;s really the only religion that has some kind of coherence to me.</p>

<p>now, what YOU believe is that the new testament was created by some malicious entity, the gnostic writings are the truth of jehova, but you have yet to explain why any of this is supposed to be true or make sense.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>These are just my mad ramblings and personal opinions. Of course you shouldn&#39;t take them with more than a grain of salt, and I also don&#39;t mean to offend.</p>

<p>I believe these things because of personal research into the occult, secret societies, and the origins of the Abrahamic religions. I believe the god of the Old Testament is evil based on his actions, but there are a few different names for god in the Old Testament books so I wasn&#39;t sure who that really was. Some of those names can be traced back to Sumerian origin which leads some to the Annunaki. There were also books tossed out from Biblical canon along the way which should raise an eyebrow. Consider that the 1611 King James Bible had 80 books and it&#39;s now down to 66. Have you read the Book of Enoch or Jasher, or Jubilee? I don&#39;t mean that you should, just that it should surprise you there are other books out there and that they&#39;re slowly being worked out of the mainstream availability.</p>

<p>Consider 2 Corinthians 4:4 New Living Translation (NLT):
<strong>Satan, who is the god of this world</strong>, has blinded the minds of those who don’t believe.</p>

<p>One reason I value Gnosticism is the fact that the Latin/Roman Catholic Church specifically sought it out to destroy it as heresay during campaigns of the Inquisition and most notably of those was the slaughter of the Cathars in 14th century France. </p>

<p>Just a few things to consider.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Bible and all other Abrahamic religious texts are actually encrypted systems formed in such a way that the dumb masses read it one way and those with a deeper occult knowledge (and possibly gematria knowledge) receive a different message altogether. The Gnostic texts were nearly wiped out by the Latin Church most notably through their slaughter of the group of people known as the Cathars. I&#39;ve also read that the Library of Alexandria was managed by Gnostic sects and that&#39;s why it was destroyed.</p>

<p>In short we as human beings don&#39;t really have one source for truth. (((They))) have many texts to reference and their synagogues and churches are supported by the government. Kinda easy to figure out which ones we aren&#39;t supposed to know about.</p>

<p>My username is a resentful admission for we all servants of Saturn in this world whether we like it or not.</p>

<li>Occult writings by the likes of Aleister Crowley, Manly P. Hall&#39;s &quot;The Mystical Teachings of All Ages&quot;, Israel Regardie, Dion Fortune&#39;s &quot;The Mystical Qabalah&quot;, books on Solomon&#39;s magic.</li>
<li>Any writings you can find on Scottish Rite Freemasonry, the Rosicrucians, the Jesuits, and other secret societies. Understand the symbolism and why it&#39;s used.</li>
<li>Albert Pike&#39;s &quot;Morals and Dogma&quot;, which is extremely dense reading but it reveals a lot of secrets.</li>
<li>&quot;Protocols of the Elders of Zion&quot;. There are way too many authors/books out there desperately trying to frame this as a forgery. IMO they&#39;ve overplayed their hand here and it&#39;s obvious that it&#39;s not a forgery.</li>
<li>David Icke. Yes really. His message is being spun in a New Age way, but his research is really close to the truth regardless of what&#39;s really going on with the reptilian entities IMO.</li>

    <div class="md"><p>What makes me say that some aliens are demons?</p>

<p>Well, to be honest with you, I personally wouldn&#39;t really say that some ETs are &quot;demons&quot; per se.  I mean you have to define what a demon is in the first place.  As far as I understand the term, &quot;demon&quot; tends to mean &quot;a malicious incorporeal being&quot;, no?  In that sense, I guess <em>some</em> ETs can indeed be not of this physical third dimension - making them incorporeal enough - and some ETs that are not third dimensional have not so good intentions where it regards human beings.  If you combine those two characteristics, then I guess one would get what some would describe as &quot;demons&quot;.  However, and again, I personally wouldn&#39;t necessarily describe them as &quot;demons&quot;.  I&#39;d describe those beings as what they are:  Malicious, non-third-dimensional beings that are not from planet Earth.</p>

<p>Are there beings not from planet Earth that aren&#39;t necessarily from the third dimension and don&#39;t have good intentions toward humans?  Sure.  I&#39;d imagine there are.</p>

<p>I also know that there are a <em>lot</em> of them (possibly even more so) that <em>aren&#39;t</em> negative or malicious as well, however.</p>

<p>Additionally, I would further imagine that MOST extraterrestrials - regardless of their dimension - likely don&#39;t give too much of a heck about human beings at all.</p>

<p>I don’t understand this question.  Rephrase it, if you will.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It sounds like enslavement means you would be bound to something,</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Don’t be too literal.  One can enslave another mentally as much if not more than physically and keep the enslaved individual confined to a particular debilitating mindset and perspective.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>but scripture preaches the opposite.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Scripture itself is to a massive extent enslaving.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Romans 6:23 For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is all vague metaphor.  I’m referring to logic based upon assessment and understanding - a different thing altogether.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Now, you don&#39;t have to do anything virtually to get into heaven but believe in Him.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So if I rape and kill your mother and daughter in front of you, and then rape you yourself and laugh while I’m doing it, but then afterward I say I “believe in Him”, then all will be okay and I’ll be fine?</p>

<p>Wat?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>That doesn&#39;t sound like enslavement, because you aren&#39;t tied into doing a certain action to get there.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It’s enslavement because it’s a fabrication that’s been perpetuated to keep people locked in a particular type of shallow thinking.  It’s actually part of the <em>very</em> thing I mentioned above, actually.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Christianity is, in fact, the only religion in which you don&#39;t have to do a physical thing to get to heaven. Enslavement? No.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Christianity is one of the pillars of human enslavement on this planet actually.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Not when you consider the end result of the message.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It’s not about the message.  It’s about what that message <em>really</em> means when you peer past the brainwashing.  It’s about who it was that put it in place, and how it’s been used to keep a large portion of the human species shackled and enslaved as a result of it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can&#39;t say categorically either way but do lean heavily towards the idea that aliens are in fact interdimensional or Demonic.</p>

<p>They have been written about and referred to for hundreds of years, if you go back too far, it can get lost in translation, but still the records are there. With this in mind I have some questions.</p>

<p>Why would an intelligent, technologically advanced race of beings &quot;travel&quot; all this way to spend hundreds of years quietly on the periphery of humanity. No attack, no great disclosure.</p>

<p>How many more times do said intelligent beings need to harvest farm stock eyeballs &amp; colons before they figure out what it is they are?</p>

<p>The sightings we see of craft and lights/orbs do not adhere to our laws of physics (impossible) when craft appear and dissapear, and when craft change directions and or merge at 1000s mph.</p>

<p>The testimonies of those abducted show an alarming trend of &quot;aliens&quot; teaching that Christianity is false and that they are really our true gods. Hmm seems strange an advanced species would care who we chose to worship.</p>

<p>There&#39;s also a very interesting link when you look at Alistair Crowley and his experience with a demon... looks very much like a grey. And look into Jack Parsons &amp; his satanic affiliation and how he was also deeply involved in the US space travel and rocket propultion.</p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/iMDHvQBJ5us">https://youtu.be/iMDHvQBJ5us</a>... if you have some free time, this brings all of it together very nicely. Satanism, our Government and Aliens/Demons.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think your pet theory is really interesting-  I&#39;ve been thinking about AI a ton lately in terms of how much it might change our world within the century. </p>

<p>I remember seeing that Musk quote, also similar warnings from other big future-looking tech folks, I want to say Bill Gates or Steve Jobs and others. I&#39;m not crazy about the concept of harmful AI as a &#39;demon&#39;- I guess I know what he&#39;s saying but a demon implies matters of morality and evil, and that reinforces the (almost certainly unrealistic) Hollywood idea of malicious robots like in The Terminator or The Matrix. </p>

<p>If an AI system threatens humanity in the future, IMO good/evil will be irrelevant to it. Rather, we&#39;d be facing something we inherently can&#39;t understand because it would be exponentially more intelligent. Reminds me of Lovecraft&#39;s literary universe, where humans mistake peeks of infinite cosmic entities as gods with our values, but really they are beyond human comprehension and unconcerned with our existence. </p>

<p>I&#39;m rambling but that&#39;s what your theory reminded me of- just the idea that we will likely create something so far beyond our intellects that our concept of intelligence will change, and our situation might resemble having &#39;tapped into&#39; something. </p>
