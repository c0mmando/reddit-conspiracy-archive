        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><ol>
<li><p>Bamford&#39;s &quot;The Puzzle Palace&quot; references one of the NSA&#39;s first self-initiated execution (suicide) with this &quot;Thought Control&quot; technology they developed. The NSA employee reportedly ran off NSA property saying demons were in his mind and he killed himself.</p></li>
<li><p>NSA Initiated Execution to Cover-up in the News: </p></li>
<li><p>A University of California at Berkley student that went into a bar on or around November 27, 1990 took hostages and insisted to the police that the CIA Director talk with him so that he could get relief from the suffering. The young man had sent letters to the president and the CIA but the requests had fallen on deaf ears. After the young man panicked and shot a customer in the bar, a SWAT team fatally shot him, the San Jose police found copies of the letters written to the President referring to people that could &quot;read minds&quot; and that he had learned how they do it. The NSA had been unsuccessfully brainwashing him and had no alternative but to terminate him to assure their security. It is interesting that what was originally broadcast on the news &quot;The gunman was demanding to talk with the Director of the CIA&quot; etc. disappeared quickly (suppressed?) from later news accounts. </p></li>
<li><p>NSA Initiated Execution to Cover-up in Music: </p></li>
<li><p>Curt Cobain of the musical group &quot;Nirvana&quot; was another victim of NSA brainwashing and was terminated by NSA. Cobain had started writing clues to the NSA activities into his music to communicate it to his music followers. He referred in music to the NSA as the &quot;Friends inside his head&quot;. Once the NSA puts on the highest level of brainwashing pain, the subject expires quickly. Cobain used heroin to numb and otherwise slow the effect of the brainwashing. </p></li>
<li><p>NSA Initiated Executions in Overseas Defense Project: </p></li>
<li><p>Some years back several employees of the United Kingdom&#39;s Government working on a top secret Radar Project committed suicide with no apparent penetration by a hostile government, drug abuse or any other commonality other than working in a secured government project. They were not &quot;Staged&quot; suicides (murders) because some of them happened behind doors that could not be opened from the outside. These men were subjected to the same technology and processes that the U.C. Berkley student, the NSA officer, Curt Cobain, and thousands of others have experienced. </p></li>
<li><p>Musical references of NSA Technology: </p></li>
<li><p>Talking Heads; a music group popular in the eighties, wrote a song explaining the scientific process of the NSA&#39;s brainwashing technology in a song called &quot;Wild Wild Life&quot;. The song gave an example of what the audible transmission sounded like at the end of the song (like a tape on fast forward). They mentioned in the song that &quot;They (NSA) talk so fast√†&quot; and that the musical group had spent &quot;All their time and money&quot; unsuccessfully trying to find a place that the NSA would not be able to harass them. The Talking Heads exposed the technology, gave an example of what it sounds like, scenarios of how the NSA might select you or the brainwashing, and the scope of the electronic surveillance system. </p></li>
