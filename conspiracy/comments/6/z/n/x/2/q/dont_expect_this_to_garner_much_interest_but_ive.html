       So I'll put it out there, I don't really think much of conspiracy theories, but I do want to look into them. It's honestly intriguing. But on the whole I just don't think anything will be convincing.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not trying to be an asshole about this, I'm generally interested. I'm not a skeptic. And I know I might come off as some kind of asshole, but let's just assume I'm not. Treat me like im stupid. Could you give me some of the basics of conspiracy theories and what I should look into?
      </p>
      <p>
       And I'm being serious, treat me like I'm stupid, because I know nothing about any of this, if you have to insult me then that's OK, just don't let it be insults for insults sake.
But like I said, don't really expect this to get many serious response's.
      </p>
      <p>
       Full disclosure, I am drunk, I am an idiot(seriously, GED recipient) but I am willing to give this a shot and keep an open mind.
      </p>
      <p>
       Work tomorrow, so response after 5pm EST, or now while im drinking.
      </p>
      <p>
       Once again, full respect twords everyone in this sub, I'm just some drunk dumb fuck trying to see a new perspective.

       Go watch a documentary, sit with a computer and research everything they mention while watching it.  It's a waste of time for us to try to point to a random conspiracy and and back it up to convince a "drunk idiot" of our point of view.

       OK, so I assumed this was a YouTube thing. Its not.

       226 pages. Wow.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've only read through 16 but this is kind of mind boggling.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think, in the state I'm in now, I can fully grasp this, but it so far seems like a link between MK ULTRA, the counterculture movement, and a full on progression twords war no matter the course? I'll keep on reading, ad since I'm drunk I'm probably wrong on my interpretation, I'll re read it when sober.

       Start with conspiracies that have solid information available confirming the truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       MK Ultra, CIA's Heart Attack Gun, Gulf of Tonkin, Operation Mockingbird, Bohemian Grove, Any US coup attempt (Iran, Bay of Pigs...etc.)
      </p>
      <p>
       These are a good place to start I think. You could read about 9/11 &amp; JFK forever and come away without a conclusion, but those ones are confirmed as true.

       a fun trip is to go looking through the major ones (9/11, MK Ultra, JFK, any presidential assassination in south america, etc...) and find that one moment where your reality disconnects from the truth. 
in other words:
where does the narrative you have been told/taught start to be different from what has been shown as fact. 
For me it was watching the Zapruder film (as part of a larger documentary on the assassination of JFK).
      </p>
      <p>
       breaking the brainwashing on any subject is difficult if not impossible. sometimes the best you can do is open your mind to an alternative possibility, but finding that disconnect point will really help.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think most importantly you should try to remember that just because a theory is presented does not make it true, it is only you who can decide for yourself based on the evidence you are presented. the truth can be what you thought it was, it can be uncomfortable, and it can be completely different.

       I'm not too deep into conspiracies. I do like to hear about them though. That's why I suggested things that are now known to have happened a certian way. If you were to go around talking about MK Ultra in 1960 you'd be labelled a kook.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe there are some conspiracies that we will never know the truth of. I doubt anyone ever comes up with evidence in the JFK case or 9/11 case.
      </p>
      <p>
       My brother-in-law signed up for the marines for that exact reason. When my wife left me home alone with him I had just heard about a cool documentary called "Zeitgeist" and decided to watch it with him. I had no idea what I was waking up in him. He's full on into conspiracies now, moreso than I.

        not

       theories. Conspiracy theorist is a term coined by the CIA to ridicule those expressing doubts over the JFK assassination.

       I'm really not into zeitgeist.
      </p>
      <p>
       To me a good documentary provides enough facts that's you can build a case for yourself, and gives you room to disagree along reasonable lines of argumentation. Most importantly, they differentiate facts from analysis.
      </p>
      <p>
       Presentations like zeitgeist or kymatica dump you into this emotionally loaded wash of conclusions, give you a few randomly selected facts, and ask you to take their word for the rest of it.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you start with something like that, you are fed an opinion without being given anything you can substantiate it with. It's giving a man a fish instead of teaching a man to fish.
      </p>
      <p>
       I recommend starting with one topic and watching a bunch of docs and you'll start to get a feel for the depth of a topic and what's possible. Something pretty close to the surface like JFK, Oklahoma city, wtc 7.... After getting a feel for a number of topics, the deeper commonalities will start to become clear.
      </p>
      <p>
       But the folks in the two docs above run with a lot of free associations, and if you're only 80% right in this game you're 110% wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       Associations, working theories, and unconfirmed leads are super valuable, but they have to be contextualized as such or your aggregate understanding is useless. It's how confirmation bias creeps in.
      </p>
      <p>
       One example of a scholar who I think does this well is ufologist Richard Dolan. He's easy to watch, read and listen to, and he makes it really clear what his premises rest on.

       Start small with less speculative material. The moon landing hoax has very little to do with 9/11 false flag, but they both appear under the conspiracy umbrella, why is that? Because the CIA weaponized the term to shut down any discussion of government corruption.
      </p>
      <p>
       I recommend these to start out:
      </p>
      <p>
       C.I.A. – drug-dealing, black ops, coups, false flags
      </p>
      <p>
       9/11 Truth – War on Terror, Greater Israel Project
      </p>
      <p>
       MK-ULTRA – Satanic Ritual Abuse, Pedophocracy.

       Usually people start with a single topic that they're interested in that they fall down the rabbit hole researching and along the way other points start getting connected.
      </p>
      <p>
       But if you're serious about finding truth you should know that there's some really dark shit out there and you'll want to look away, but it's important to shine the light to make the roaches scatter or else things will never get better.

       I don't want to come off like an ass here  but here I go.

      <p>
       I didn't go into this to find truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       And bam, I'm an ass.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm just looking to find a different point of view. Because I'm interested.
      </p>
      <p>
       This might make me come off as disingenuous, but I'm not. I think, no matter what the subject, any theories should be discussed. I don't know, i just think being a "doubting Thomas" is a good thing. I think everyone should play "devils advocate".

       I used to believe we landed on the moon until I started digging into it. Now I am pretty sure we have never made it much beyond our immediate surroundings, just beyond our atmosphere

       I don't think I could ever believe the moon landing was fake.

       Lost 30 lbs, clearer minded, less depressed, less angry, sleeping better, playing with my kid more, loving my wife more.... everything is better. I am not sober completely, I still smoke weed here and there. Alcohol was my worst enemy.

       Start out by watching Zeitgiest. There are three Zeitgeist documentaries, all three of them are extremely eye opening and insightful.
      </p>
      <p>
       After you watch those, you'll probably want to look more into 9/11 as it was the catalyst event that changed the landscape of the US and the entire world forever. There is a metric shit ton of information you can gather online. More than enough to convince any sane person that there was foul play.

       I would probably start with Operation Northwoods: that at least gives you an idea of the kind of things that governments and the alphabet agencies have planned in the past.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think the biggest barrier for people to look 'behind the curtain' is the idea that people could actually be as despicable as they are. There is a tendency to think
       <em>
        they surely
       </em>
       <strong>
        <em>
         wouldn't
        </em>
       </strong>
       <em>
        do something like that?!
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       Once you understand that they absolutely
       <em>
        would
       </em>
       , it can broaden your mind sufficiently to start questioning things.
