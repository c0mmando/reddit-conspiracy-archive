        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Can you feel it? The looming age of fear and distortion is at it&#39;s end. The confusion of our situation, our beliefs, values and perspectives on the world, and our own lives is being cleared away. It is inevidible. Without darkness there is no light. </p>

<p>What do you have to offer in the New World? What gifts of knowledge or creation have given you purpose and meaning in your life up until now? How could it be used to please humanity?</p>

<p>It&#39;s happening in our lifetime to see how wonderful it is to be alive, but danger threatens our existence. The darkest energies of this world underlay every crevace of thought, word and deed, bubbling under the surfaces of the subconscious and physically taking form in the disasters that effect the Earth. The time is NOW. You must WAKE UP so we can stop this madness! Take responsibility for your thoughts, words and deeds, it all plays a role in the outcome. There is no more room for hatred. No more room for self-worshipping. No more room for meaningless pursuits. </p>

<p>Make space for LOVE to enter in today. </p>

<p>The Age of Enlightenment is here. </p>

<p>We are the creators of reality and if you believe we can only be free after immense suffering, then you hold personal responsiblity for that outcome. There is no need for that. You do not have to choose to wait until worse happens before you wake up. Wake up now and choose to change reality for the better. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Every situation teaches you something about yourself. You can&#39;t discover yourself without suffering. Avoiding suffering or pretending it&#39;s not there, will invite more suffering. Only when you are aware, the suffering stops. You have to understand the cause and effect of every little thing that happens. Collective consciousness is not what you think it is. There are many levels to this reality and if I started explaining it to you, you&#39;d think I&#39;m crazy, because you wouldn&#39;t be able to relate it to anything you&#39;ve experienced, heard or read about. You have to discover it for yourself. All I can say, forget about &quot;collective consciousness&quot;, it&#39;s a solo journey. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You have no idea what this world is. We are not creators of our reality. Everyone&#39;s personalities and paths are pre-programmed.   Choices and thoughts are pre-programmed. While you think you have control - you don&#39;t. So the only thing you can do is lie to yourself, put rose glasses on and think about unicorns, but human nature will not change, children will not stop getting abused, raped and killed. It is crucial to see the world for what it is and accept it vs lying to yourself/ignoring the obvious, because it hurts too much. I&#39;m sorry, but you have a long road ahead of you. Enlightenment is never about rainbows and unicorns, it&#39;s suffering. There&#39;s a reason why they say &quot;You have to reach the bottom and face your own death to reach enlightenment&quot;. You can&#39;t just think happy thoughts and gain wisdom.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t claim to know everything. I do however know that ages of enlightenment have existed before. I do see the potential that we have as human beings. I see the way music and art heals people. That&#39;s all I need to know that it is well within our capability and the only thing stopping us is ourselves. It&#39;s not about pretending suffering doesn&#39;t happen. Release from suffering can only happen if suffering is there. Actions produce results. Not making a choice IS a choice. You effect the world whether you do something to change your situation consciously or not. We effect each other&#39;s worlds and I know I haven&#39;t done my part until now and I&#39;n ready to change and make better relationships, put more intention into my art, start putting my time and money into things that matter to me and align with goodness. I&#39;m tired of living any other way than that and I gauruntee others are too. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>We do not make choices. It&#39;s an illusion. Your choices are determined by who you are at that particular point. Who you are is determined by experience. So, once again, if you grew up in a third world country, abused by alcoholic parents, your choices are going to be limited by your experience and your circumstance. Ok, I think I figured out a way to explain how this works. Picture yourself as a part of a virtual reality video game. What your player looks like and what it can do is pre-designed by the creators of the game. All you can do is choose what to do with the tools and attributes that you&#39;ve been provided. Not all characters in that video game are going to be other players, like yourself, a lot of them are going to be characters generated by the game itself to create a certain atmosphere, setting. You know all those characters in reality are controlled by the same program, they are all connected, have the same &quot;consciousness&quot;. So imagine not realizing that you are a part of this game. You look around for clues as to how to navigate this game, but all you see is these characters generated by the video game. So you think you are one of them. So you start emulating them, but somehow it&#39;s just not working out. After a while you realize there are levels in this game and if you fail a level, you repeat it in a different setting, if you pass, you level up. Each time you level up, you discover something new about the game and your unique role in it. The point of the game is not to change the game, the point of the game is to pass all levels, while realizing it&#39;s just a game. That is a very basic explanation, but it&#39;s something that is relatable to most people. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes but youre not your thoughts, theres a step above/beyond being who you are at this point in time, and its the true you. </p>

<p>Now and forever youre a reflection of your environment growing up, your instincts and thoughts are molded by experience but theres something to realize about the illusion of this and its that youre not your thoughts. Buddhism and meditation teaches us that.</p>

<p>In the end I think we&#39;re all apart of this &quot;one&quot; consciousness, a form of intangible energy being woken up to experience this form of reality, for whatever reason. </p>

<p>Its all just an illusion, like you turn on your new phone and its connected to the internet, thats how I feel we are, the same but different phone/mind/body connected to the one internet/consciousness, experiencing different point of views I guess.</p>

<p>But why?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And to continue on the whole video game theme. It&#39;s not an age of enlightenment, it&#39;s just a change of setting. If you are into mythology and esoteric texts, you have probably heard of 6 ages of men, 6 Adams. The world/the game was completely different with humans being completely different at every &quot;age&quot;/&quot;stage&quot;. The purpose was different, abilities were different and the settings were different. Does that make sense? So what&#39;s happening now, is just a change of stage. There&#39;s a possibility, that it&#39;s going to be a drastic, complete wipe out with only the major players left kind of situation. But all the major players have to already reach a certain level of the game.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, this is my feeling too.</p>

<p>The companies that control the media / the most popular websites are actively censoring opinions that don&#39;t line up with their own.</p>

<p>Europe is being subjected to mass transfers of people who aren&#39;t suitable for their society for years now and it&#39;s barely stopping.</p>

<p>The US is going through a period where statues are being torn down, racism is rampant from all sides and the country is completely divided on the president.</p>

<p>Even this website, this very community is controlled.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are way too pessimistic.  Communists aren&#39;t confused souls.  They know exactly what they want and they will do anything to get it.  Even though the left may not realize they are Communists they know exactly what they want.</p>

<p>Censorship.  Hate speech laws.  Welfare.  Equal Outcome.  Globalism.  Total control of the State by the State.</p>

<p>Donald Trump&#39;s greatest achievement is exposing the left exactly for what it is.  Through various leaks and FOIA an agenda from the left was emerging.  That same agenda has been pushed by universities for decades.  From the entertainment industry since the turn of the century.  Our news media pushes the leftist/globalist agenda (the news has probably always been propaganda but the fact that they are definitely propaganda right now is beyond reproach).  Donald Trump made them defend their positions and they&#39;ve done it.  From leniency to criminals to amnesty for illegals to allowing mentally ill people in our military Trump has made the left let us know it&#39;s for real.</p>

<p>Btw these crazy words like Communism and Cultural Marxism are real.  And that&#39;s what has infected America for a very long time.  The problem is words and concepts and ideas have been so diluted and manipulated that nobody gets things any more.  It&#39;s just &quot;this sounds right, I&#39;m for it!&quot;.  And even though we have all the information in the world at our fingertips and everyone throughout history has always warned us if we ignore history we are doomed to repeat it we keep failing.</p>

<p>There is a power struggle going on in the world right now.  TPTB are losing their grip on the greatest empire the world has ever seen.  If it weren&#39;t for the left we could instantly take down TPTB.  The only reason we can&#39;t pull the trigger right now is because of the leftist base.  </p>

<p>What is the leftist base?  I&#39;ve already covered it but let me remind you.  Anti freedom of speech.  Anti 2nd Amendment.  Actively trying to get a democratically elected president removed.  If it weren&#39;t for the establishment it&#39;s scary to think what would happen to leftists.  How do you humanely deal with so many traitors to your nation?</p>

<p>Who knows.  But what I do know is that I can never unite with someone who wants Communist ideals and is a traitor to their nation.  So when you ask me to unite with the left I respectfully decline.  Instead I ask the left to reject their Communist ideals.  Give up your dedication to the State.  Fight the establishment.  If we were all doing that we would win so fucking hard.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And all generalizations are false, including this one.</p>

<p>I&#39;m afraid what OP is proposing is exactly what adolescents and young adults all thought and told themselves back in the 60&#39;s and early 70&#39;s, it even looked like we, (I happened to be one of them), might be winning for a while, yet look at where it has gotten us. </p>

<p>As I look back now I actually understand how naïve we were about just how much the deck was really stacked against us before we even started and just how pernicious and pervasive &quot;the system&quot; as we called it, was, or how ruthless, mean spirited, and downright vicious &quot;the establishment&quot; could get when it&#39;s power and authority over everyone was even marginally threatened by something new or different on the social scene they didn&#39;t create or have complete control over, and it&#39;s only gotten worse, far worse in the meantime.</p>

<p>Being in control allows them to co-opt and take control over virtually anything or anyone else and bend them to their own advantage and they&#39;ve literally been doing that for centuries and they&#39;ve gotten so successful at it they don&#39;t even care if we know about it at this point. The abuses are constant and blatant and no one can do anything about them.</p>

<p>The so-called &quot;Enlightenment&quot; you&#39;re talking about was far from being that with the eminent scholars, and plenty of aristocrats who led or endorsed that movement simply declaring that they were the new enlightened ones and a new final authority on everything that they set about to redefine in their own image, except that there was nothing new about them or that for that matter. </p>

<p>Meanwhile in Newton&#39;s England there were over 250 crimes any commoner could be put to death for, including the theft of as little as three shillings and it wasn&#39;t uncommon for any of them to be brutally tortured before they were. Newton himself after being made the Master of the Mint &quot;for services rendered&quot; with a private commission granted on everything the mint issued and which made him one of the wealthiest men in England, even went out of his way to see to it that two petty counterfeiters were hanged for their crime, the eminent and enlightened fellow that he was. </p>

<p>He personally lost over 100,000 pounds speculating on the South Sea Bubble Co. after which all economic bubbles are named, a veritable king&#39;s ransom, without putting so much as a dent in his vast fortune.</p>

<p>That Enlightenment was simply a case of the Powers That Be re-inventing their image in a more favorable light for an even greater advantage. The very same men who created the first lodge of Freemasonry in London with it&#39;s blood oath to never reveal the real secrets of the Universe to anyone not initiated into their private club were the very same ones who created the Royal Society whose purpose was stated as being just the very opposite.</p>

<p>Despite not being a mason, Newton was their choice to lead it and every member he ever appointed to it was either a high ranking mason or soon to become one. The very same situation existed in France with the establishment of the Academy of Paris. The New Science was defined, created, and promoted by the Freemasons and backed by the wealthiest men of the times on their way to being even wealthier and more powerful than they already were.</p>

<p>You want real enlightenment you read the buried and never talked about works of Newton&#39;s arch rival Leibniz who was the last true genius since Archimedes and who already understood the basics of Quantum theory and Relativity then while Newton and his backers were all busy pushing abject Materialism and re-introducing the banned and discredited philosophy behind it by the back door disguised as &quot;Science&quot;.</p>

<p>You show me how we&#39;ve had it so good after existing as a species for well over 150,000 years only to arrive at a point three hundred years after that so-called Enlightenment and New Science arrived to where we now have serious doubts about simply lasting a hundred more without destroying ourselves with all that we&#39;ve apparently learned and accomplished because of them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Define golden age. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t think you guys realize what Aquarius really signifies. Birds eye view, Aquarius is the ruling seat of &quot;Air&quot; by that the rational and dominating energies (3rd circuit in Prometheus Rises). It&#39;s about control and establishing order. The end game of the Aquarian is the Illuminati not some fraternal philosopher order.</p>

<p>There is nothing freeing about it. Humans are a shit tier freedom species. We need order and stability from a strong hand. That is what the Age of Aquarius is ushering in. The last gasps of shame and emotional control from Pisces are fading. </p>

<p>The Aquarian is going to dominate you and take advantage of all of your faults, not try and work together to bring in a golden age.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d like to believe but I think your missing something, a key part of the issue.  It isn&#39;t that people are becoming more enlightened it&#39;s that you&#39;re finding more people that are enlightened.  Your accumulated enlightenment with everyone you connect with gives the appearance that more and more people are enlightened.  Unfortunately the same can be said for those who are withdrawing and focusing on isolation and fear.</p>

<p>They two are seeing a growing trend of isolation and fear as they are experiencing a similar trend of increasing constructiveness with like minded individuals.  For each person moving to a humanistic approach to their thoughts and actions there is another moving towards a selfish and individualistic state of being.  The irony in becoming more isolated in your beliefs through connections is lost on these individuals.  There is irony in the process of promoting and supporting a humanistic approach is that to be isolated and fearful is to be human.</p>

<p>Fortunately the enlightenment isn&#39;t so much a swing to one state or the other, it&#39;s the understanding that both exist, will continue to exist, and should exist.  Balance is required.  This balance can be maintained by understanding what it means to be humanistic, isolated, loving, and fearful.  Once we can understand and respect these aspects of being human we can move forward to enlightenment.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Right but like the age of Enlightenment will never come unless we synthesize everything we&#39;ve learned and become balanced with all of who we are. We can never see objective reality without first looking outside ourselves. </p>

<p>We are dreamers and this is a dream. This a Twin Peaks reference BTW.</p>

<p>We exist in a realm where good and evil exist. And for us to truly begin to evolve we must take into ourselves both our good and bad selves.</p>

<p>For you see, light casts shadows and the strongest lights cast the darkest shadows. I think Egyptians explained this best in their explanation of the after life and judgement.</p>

<p>Your heart is weighed with both good actions to others and good actions to yourself. We must be good to others and good to ourselves. This means that morality will always be in the gray area no matter what we wish to believe.</p>

<p>Religion, gender, and class has limited us for far too long. We are unable to see past the restrictions placed on us and we place on ourselves. Lift these and the ecstasy of balance will grow. </p>

<p>Balance is key.</p>

<p>&quot;That&#39;s not a conspiracy, that is just some asshole living in a basement&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Why would they do that, I mean they have no heart of they do this to people&quot;</p>

<p>I have been able to convince these friends to at least try cannabis once with me and to enjoy a good afternoon cookout and just talk. It was only fair since I always joined them for their bar runs and drinking nights. :)</p>

<p>You can see the enlightenment in their eyes when they take cannabis and enjoy a great afternoon of just chatting away at world subjects, and deep thoughts about world affairs. </p>

<p>Everything from JFK to North Korea just becomes a great learning experience. These are Nurses, Doctors, IT professionals and even stay at home Moms have something special to talk about. </p>

<p>Once their mind is open, it is just a torrent of sub-conscience information that they have been bottling up for a very long time.</p>

<p><strong>I believe that Cannabis is going to help a great deal to bring in a new Renaissance in thinking, creativity, activism, philosophy, and spirituality that is so needed in this world.</strong></p>

<p>The OP should take a look at history, only in the last 100ish years has there ever existed a powerful and wealthy middle class such as we have today and the elites are, quite literally, doing all they can to destroy that unwelcome wealthy middle class.</p>

<p>There will be no &quot;enlightenment&quot; for the common man, there will be no &quot;singularity&quot; for the common man, the future will only be bright for those in control and the rest of us will be driven down to what the elites consider the proper place for the masses.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It does feel like the light is shining brighter and more people are embracing some kind of spirituality while rejecting more materialistic views. The intense darkness and evil being unleashed has an equal and opposite reaction. The evil in the world is waking people up and bringing them into the light. </p>

<p>There are some that say the elite are operating by this principle. The evil they create is for the greater good. They say that enlightenment only comes after extreme darkness, to the point of death. Only then can a soul be reborn into the light. This is true to some extent, 911 was the event that changed my paradigm, although I highly doubt the elite really have any noble intentions. </p>

<p>We also have an ever growing group of people who believe that extraterrestrial beings affiliated with the Galactic Federation of light are working to upgrade our collective conscience grid! They believe that once the old grid is destroyed; the new grid will bring about a ascension event. This is one of the more outlandish schools of thought out there, but there is some scientific evidence that something like this could occur. Voyager data shows earth is moving into a highly charged plasma cloud. When energy moves through a electromagnetic field; it changes form. Change will definitely come due to this movement, but exactly what we will see remains unknown. </p>

<p>I believe we are entering the final stages of a ancient spiritual battle and that decisions we make now will determine the plight of our spiritual evolution. We are all in tune with the resonant frequency of earth. Our brain/heart waves flow in harmony with it and have evolved with it from the beginning. As we approach this plasma cloud; we may experience a shift towards a higher frequency which may assist in our spiritual advancement. Perhaps the elite is aware of this because there is definitely a agenda to keep us locked into lower states of vibration. OurDNA acts more like a radio receiver than a set in stone blue print. DNA processes information it picks up in our environment and then it begins to decode it. The sun is very important in this process, but under the veil of climate engineering, the light from the sun is being blocked. Aerosol nano aluminum particles are blocking the life giving energy of the sun back into space and are bouncing artificial microwave RF frequencies back down to us. We are being deprived of our natural frequencies, created by the sun and earths energy fields, and being exposed to artificial frequencies. The elite agenda is to have us tuned in to the artificial energy grid where our evolution can be thwarted. They want to ionize the atmosphere creating a wireless control grid where AI tech and a sea of harmful electromagnetic radiation keeps us tuned into lower vibrational states that are unable to access higher energy coming from above. </p>

<p>Very interesting times we live in!!!</p>

I believe this struggle will continue for at least a decade and the regression could get much worse possibly even to a dangerous level that could take many decades to recover from. Hopefully we can avoid this but it seems entirely possible since there are real live facists, some of whom are in power,  who want a very different was of life.

    <div class="md"><p>Hey, first worlder. So do children make a choice to be abused, raped and murdered by their parents? Do people, that suffered irreversible damage, after surviving child abuse make their own choices? What makes your choices yours, if everyone is just a clusterfuck of cliches, downloaded by their parents, teachers, surroundings, books, television, etc? </p>

<p>News flash: That&#39;s what they said about Obama.  That&#39;s what they said about Clinton.  That&#39;s what they said about Martin Luther King.  That&#39;s what they said about Kennedy.</p>

<p>It&#39;s fine to dream for a better day, but all you are doing is fooling yourself.  the broader picture is quite obvious.  The police state will insure that people don&#39;t get an enlightening other than what our masters want.</p>

<p>Beyond that, I am simply speechless.. for now. Need to sleep on it. But I can definitely say; What a time to be alive. </p>

<p>Thank you again!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As absurd as it sounds everything is a learning experience. And there&#39;s a choice to apply the energy from that experience into something that benefits the organism who experienced it.</p>

<p>It may take many years but time heals old wounds. Acting negatively on past trauma breeds more negativity and so the cycle continues, breaking it breaks the cycle.</p>

<p>This all boils down to personal philosophies and psychology and it&#39;s important for each person to realize who they are and their purpose.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I used to buy into the &#39;weed is good for you&#39; meme. Then I met a few people, one by one, who clearly had gone too far with it, smoking every day in many cases, and there was a pattern I noticed: they seemed lost in their own little worlds, almost unable to distinguish between objective and subjective. These were (in most cases) intelligent people. Many of them had stopped being productive, they would spend their time outside of work watching &#39;documentaries&#39; or YouTube. Capable people doing nothing but working and watching telescreens, exactly as TPTB would want...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dark as far as species survivability. When everyone can only survive literally by buying something from a glorified food trough, that&#39;s some pretty dark behavior.</p>

<p>Food and water should be something organisms don&#39;t need spoon fed to them. Ecosystems should provide all sustencece for those who live in it.</p>

<p>We&#39;ve just organized the world to centralize survival. Instead of letting it happen normally,  without making money from it needlessly, so some control freak bean counter can gather a bunch of capitol to bully all life.</p>
