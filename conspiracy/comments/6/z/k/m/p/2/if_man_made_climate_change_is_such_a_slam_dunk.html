       Switzerland’s weather bureau adjusted its raw temperature data so that “the temperatures reported were consistently higher than those actually recorded.”
       <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150522010938/http://news.heartland.org/newspaper-article/2015/05/18/temperature-fibbers-being-investigated">

       Paul Homewood documented how NASA has “homogenized” temperature data across Paraguay to create a warming trend that doesn’t exist in the raw data.

       The Australian Bureau of Meteorology (ABM) was forced to admit it adjusts temperatures recorded at all weather stations across the country.
      </p>
      <p>
       Almost all the alterations resulted in higher temperatures being reported for the present and lower numbers for the past--with the higher numbers being used to demonstrate a historical warming trend--than the numbers that were actually recorded. Downward homogenizations in recent years were rare. In some areas, downward temperature trends measured over time showed a significantly increased temperature trend after homogenization. The difference between actually measured temperatures and homogenized temperatures topped 4 degrees Celsius over certain periods at some measuring stations.

       "The Australian Bureau of Meteorology (ABM) was recently forced to admit it alters the temperatures recorded at almost all the official weather stations in Australia. The ABM came clean on its temperature fiddling largely because of the fierce scrutiny of Graham Lloyd, environment editor for The Australian and The Weekend Australian, who published a series of articles on the ABM’s number-fudging."

       If trump is anti-war, why did he prolong the 16 year military occupation where 1000s of innocent civilians have been murdered?
      </p>
      <p>
       If trump is for nationalism why didn't he move troops to the border instead of Afghanistan?

       Federal income tax goes to the owners of the federal reserve. Through this false debt and illegal usury USA citizens are enslaved. This makes the owners of the federal reserve the unseen oligarchy of the USA.

       So people like you can take sides a debate a side issue while 7 billion humans have to sleep in the same bed that our industrial economy is shitting in.

       If you fail to mention ecosystem collapse when you bitch about the carbon debate (which is too complex to perfectly model) you have helped them do their job.
      </p>
      <p>
       People like you are leading a generation to accept the ongoing onslaught against the ecosystem.    The debate about carbon and its effects is a false agenda.    You are giving that agenda credibilty by not exposing its main purpose,  to defer action to save the ecosystem.   The effect of what you are doing is to make people think humans are not killing off the planet.    Humans are killing off the planet while people like you point to the false agenda of carbon and climate models.

       Do you see what you just did?    I made no claims about CO2.  CO2 as a measure of ecosystem health is the wrong measure.   You used the CO2 argument to imply the ecosystem is just fine.

       Go ahead and keep hijacking the real conversation which is human effects on ecosystem collapse.    The pro CO2 people and the anti CO2 people are monopolizing the conversation to the effect that ecosystem collapse continues without being properly addressed.

       A carbon tax which will be preceded by a huge transfer of power to some power structure controlled by 'wise men' will kill a quick billion people. This topic, which is HEAVILY downvoted in r/conspiracy by both bots/shills and people who do not distinguish between pollution and wealth transfer, is the biggest conspiracy there is (IMO).

       Isn't this the story of our lives?    Its the problem of a highly technical society having large institutions where decisons are made by technocrats in far off places.    Compounded by the corruption of corporate money buying the politicians.   That means that the hallmarks of civilization:   education,  transportation,  energy,  medicine,  science,  are all now contaminated.   Effectively privatized in the hands of an elite.    Its no longer a commmonweath but a private fiefdom,  serfdom,  plantation.    That fact that there is any culture,  art,  poetry,  or commons,  public space,  shared wealth,  left,  is merely a relic at this point,  preserved by those who are outside of the creeping take over of huge global bureaucracies that are not responsive to the real needs of people other than in an attempt to exploit for money ever human point of consumption and to tax that as well.    So,  effiectively its an impovershment.
      </p>
      <p>
       But the answer is not further privatization.    The answer has to do with people changing their values such that private accumulaton of consumer items for status does not further degrade resources that need to be committed to shared infrastructure.    And at the same time decentralizing control over that shared infrastructure so that more value is apportioned and controlled at the most local level possible.
      </p>
      <p>
       People have lost hope that there is a solution.    Society drifts and power is not challenged because there is no vision of how local power could be less corrupt and there is fear of additional change that could lead to people losing what they still have.    There is still a big proportion of people,  near 40 or 50% in the US,  that fear that they have something to lose,  that want their pensions,  portfolios,  whatever,  to be there.    These people will continue to vote for the powers that be,  in fear that if this system,  this establishment,  as corrupt as it may be,  if it fails, they will live in the dark and starve.   So,  they continue to slowly boil like a frog.   The trend continues.    Have you ever heard of Kafka's book,  The Trial?     A growing class of technocrats end up taking pleasure in fucking people over just because they can.

       I propose the end of government of, by,  and for the elite.    I propose that in its place,  we have local communities where workers participate along with other key parties,  where the first order of business is to end and prevent corruption and the second order of business is to tackle the concerns that are inherent to civil (civilized) societies.    The recent personhood issues of corporations have openned the door to where the rights of rivers,  oceans,  land,  ground water etc.  can be legaly represented and respected.    In addition,  there is no reason that the ongoing status of profit making entities cannot be challenged,  that some corporations may have forfeited their status as ongoing concerns due to criminality.
      </p>
      <p>
       In other words,  the problem is not regulation,  the problem is corruption of those who have privatized regulation.   Regulation as a public action is not government,  it is community.    Failure to regulate in a household is not saying we should have less family,  it is saying the family is dysfunctional or may not even exist.
      </p>
      <p>
       Community has almost ceased to exist.   I propose more community.    I propose appropriate regulation.   I do not propose the end of regulation.    The end of regulation is the end of civilization.
      </p>
      <p>
       The conversation hasn't even hardly started.    The agenda for the conversation is kept on innane issues that can never be resolved,  by design.    The agenda to resolve issues is intentionally postponed so that the only entity allowed to set the agenda and make the decisions is able to do so privately and in secret,  and the issues are not allowed to be clarified.    For example,  the issue is not carbon dioxide being causal or not causal.    The issue is not shitting in our beds.    They want to shit in our beds,  so they don't want that on the table.

       Agree,  that is a point I always make myself,  but remember,  capitalism is a system of exchange as well,  one that if not regulated,  if the playing field is not kept level,  if the interests of the shared wealth of a clean environment are not honored,  degenerates in short order into crony capitalism.
      </p>

       As a kid,  I grew up partly in Zagreb,  which in the 60's was a regulated society (state regulated) that tolerated a huge amount of free market exchange of consumer items.    In other words,  it was a dictatorship of an elite but had provisions for competition as well,  a rather delicate balance.    I also visited Spain and Portugal,  which were basically fascist dictatorships with a social welfare state incorporated in an attempt to buy off the former socialistic/communistic trades union movements that has lost the civil war.    In other words,  what was the difference between Franco and Tito except one proclaimed to hate the facists and the other proclaimed to hate the socialist/communists?    In other words,  both were practical and found a path that worked for them at the time.
      </p>
      <p>
       Practical people will have to chose regulation.    Idealistic people will let their ideal guide them and will rationalize a "temporary" dictatorship of the proletariat which was never of the proletariat,  or a "temporary" sell out to "free market principles" that are really an excuse to engorge an elite of wealth extractors.
      </p>
      <p>
       Marx was one of the closest to describing the clash,  but he enshrined an unending hostility,  class warfare that would end up supporting a nomenclatura of its own.
      </p>
      <p>
       The sharing of information was never possible as much as it is today,   the need for centralized decision making has been replaced by the toxicity of centralized decisoin making,   even corporations are forced to flatten the heirarchy in order to be responsive enough to survive,  or they don't.    Top down control can't and won't work in this environment.
      </p>
      <p>
       We have been taught to have government and shared wealth in principle,   but have learned to tolerate dictatorship and confiscation of wealth.    Its ironic,  but the liberatian leanings are as much a part of the problem as anything.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am for killing the carbon trading scam,  but I am not for killing the ability of local people to imprison those who trample their lives.    To imprison people requires a system of rule of law and administration.   We should not hate administration,  only administration that represents an elite.

       pollution which is a killer of peoples and regional environments gets ignored, a fake thing like carbon and climate gets all the publicity.

       Such a great point! Regardless of people's opinion's, this is the reality. We are forced to two sides of a debate that don't solve anything. Classic diffusion of resistance, much like what we see in political theater.

       So people like you can take sides a debate a side issue while 7 billion humans have to sleep in the same bed that our industrial economy is shitting in.    Carbon cycle,  carbon dioxide,  no one could pick a better subject in terms of the impossibility of pinning down a consensus,   especially when billions of dollars of corrupt wrangling over "rights to pollute" are at stake.    We have all been pawned,  but the worst part is that the needed conversations have been avoided because all the talk is about bs details and bs corruption.
      </p>
      <p>
       The agenda is to not talk about the air,  rivers,  earth and food,  the ground water,  that is being contaminated,   the life that is being wiped out and shortened.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thanks again for helping to divert attention onto a distraction and not helping to redirect the conversation to the tangible facts of the destruction of the earths ecosystem.

       Doesn't matter if you think climate change is real or not. What matters is how much longer you want to rely on oil and gas, and by proxy, Exxon, Saudi Arabia, and the rest of the Middle East and all the wars for oil.

       They support a carbon tax because
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         It hurts Big Oil's main competition (Big Coal) more than it hurts Big Oil.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         It eases public pressure by giving Big Oil an official way to pay penance. So if they're criticized for climate change they can say "We pay our Climate Sin Tax so stfu".
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       However - these reasons, though self-servicing, do not mean a carbon tax is a bad idea. It's still a very good idea, especially as an alternative to complicated regulations.

       Just FYI. Anytime you see a talking head on tv talking about climate change. It is code for the full disclosure that there is a conscious supreme being that fights back. Call it mother nature if you dare. I believe it to be God. Climate change is fake. Im sorry but it is.

       The fact that you bring up pollution shows you are either dishonest as fuck or have no idea what you are talking about.
      </p>
      <p>
       Calling out bad science based on CO2 concentrations has zero fucks to do with pollution. Your comment is so off the mark it should be deleted and you should apologize to anyone who might have read it.

       The Clean Air act and Clean Water Act have been around since the 1970's. There are lots of laws against pollution.

       I know it's fun to just say stuff, but at least check to see if what you are saying is true.
