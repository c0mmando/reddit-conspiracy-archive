We can&#39;t get passed the mass hypnosis currently taking place on this world. The hypnosis keeps people skeptical because conspiracy theorist are discriminated against. We are seen as lesser. We are seen as psychotic. Preventing anybody hypnotized from taking us serious. We need a plan of action. Something that can start a revolution.

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s a tough one to be sure. I wish I had an answer. We&#39;re really seeing the &quot;golden age&quot; of it so to speak. This wave of anti-intellectualism where climate science, GMOs, vaccines, evolution, are all denied. Heck even &quot;flat earth&quot; is making a comeback. It&#39;s all part of their plan to dumb down the populace, make us turn our backs on science and reason so we are too stupid and irrational to study things for ourselves.</p>

<p>And the two-party system is doing it&#39;s damage as always. Get the right upset about big government but tell them big business is okay. Get the left upset about big business but tell them big government is okay. That way only half the country ever opposes the people in charge at any given time. </p>

<p>Their greatest achievement is that they have managed to convince 300 million people that big government and big business are two separate things. And to keep us fighting over which is worse.</p>

<p>For vaccines, the data out there is that they help way more than they harm, if it all. The problem is just that we are a generation so far removed from the ones that suffered at the hands of things like polio that we have nothing to compare it to. It&#39;s hard for the average joe non-scientist to know a vaccine is working or not without seeing an epidemic. </p>

<p>Maybe that&#39;s what it will take. It&#39;s depressing to consider, but we might need enough people to stop taking vaccines just so they can see we need them.</p>

<p>Uhh. I don&#39;t think it is. I think that we have to push others to think for themselves and just question everything as if they are that fucking &quot;Why? Why? Why?&quot; kid. Otherwise, you love the ones you are with. Find your peace. Don&#39;t focus too much on shitty shit and instead find your happy place whether it be nature, music, books or blood, guts and war. You do you. That&#39;s all that you can somewhat control.</p>

<p>How can we win?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Coming together as one united species and working <em>together</em> against the shit system.</p>

<p>The 99% could and would easily topple the 1% if we didn&#39;t allow ourselves to be so manipulated by the separatist, racist propaganda that the 1% have propagated for generations.</p>

<p>It&#39;s pretty simple really.  We&#39;re &quot;just&quot; ants to them, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLbWnJGlyMU">but if we all come together as one...</a></p>

<p>And the .01% know that.  That&#39;s why they keep us apart so much and so often.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think becoming a financial non-entity is the ticket, but that&#39;s a lot of hard work and sacrifice that people don&#39;t want to do. Homestead, make your own food and live a frugal lifestyle--limit $ and hydrocarbon throughput as much as possible. If you can feed yourself and don&#39;t require a normal job(income tax) it goes a lot further than any sort of protest or popular forms of activism. </p>

<p>There are tons of knock on benefits to withdrawing from the death cult(ure) but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s for most people unfortunately.</p>

<p>Information doesn&#39;t work, because the average american idiot will reject it if it threatens their identity even if it&#39;s presented to them skillfully. People have to want to change and until the change is visibly cheaper and easier than their McLives, I don&#39;t think real progress is possible. </p>

<p>It comes down to winning in your own life, whatever that means for you. If enough people do that on their own then we really do win, but expecting some kind of cohesive, coherent groundswell to knock down the elites and replace it with something better is an unrealistic approach imo. </p>
