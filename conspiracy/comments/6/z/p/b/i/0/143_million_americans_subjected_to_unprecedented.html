    <div class="md"><p>3rd of the nation should be issued new SSN. That process alone will take years. Which would put 3rd of the population in limbo for anything requiring SSN. Then 200k or so people are truly fucked, if the mean income households in the nation rests around $50,00 a year. That would create an imbalance of $10,000,000,000 for however long it would take to sort this out. Remember these companies control every aspect of our basis for financial institutions. </p>

<p>Im not following here. The world doesnt stop. Equifax has nothing to do with controlling the basis of financial institutions. What in the fuck are you talking about? They simply determine if a person is likely to pay back a loan or debt. Of which several other companies fill a similar role, experian and transunion, will easily fill any void.</p>

<p>They are not issuing millions of SSN.</p>

<p>I am from Canada, I have bad credit, just from student loans, no credit cards, and I am being sued for it, I am on social assistance and if they tried to force people on it to get RFID&#39;d, I would be put into this boat, I would lose social assistance, and I would be forced into this literal situation. </p>

<p>The second thing is I do work, but we haven&#39;t met with a judge yet, if they end up bleeding me (I live off of 1k a month total, and sadly that doesn&#39;t pay everything, do side jobs for xtra cash, nothing crazy), I am probably literally fucked. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>3rd of the nation should be issued new SSN. That process alone will take years. Which would put 3rd of the population in limbo for anything requiring SSN. Then 200k or so people are truly fucked, if the mean income households in the nation rests around $50,00 a year. That would create an imbalance of $10,000,000,000 for however long it would take to sort this out. Remember these companies control every aspect of our basis for financial institutions. </p>
