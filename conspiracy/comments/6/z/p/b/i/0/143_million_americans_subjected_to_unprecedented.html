       rough estimates put 200k at a loss of their entire info from credit to ssn. 140m ssn and partial info lost. Three companies for the entire US.. one of which compromised 3rd of the nation. I trust no corporation, I would venture a guess a few more people are think the same today.

       3rd of the nation should be issued new SSN. That process alone will take years. Which would put 3rd of the population in limbo for anything requiring SSN. Then 200k or so people are truly fucked, if the mean income households in the nation rests around $50,00 a year. That would create an imbalance of $10,000,000,000 for however long it would take to sort this out. Remember these companies control every aspect of our basis for financial institutions.

       Im not following here. The world doesnt stop. Equifax has nothing to do with controlling the basis of financial institutions. What in the fuck are you talking about? They simply determine if a person is likely to pay back a loan or debt. Of which several other companies fill a similar role, experian and transunion, will easily fill any void.

       Just dubious that Equifax has the ability to permanently destroy the US economy. Not even dubious, im positive. All 3 major US indices brushed it off as a non event, and jumped to all time highs, on tax reform optimism today.

       Having bad credit is not going to protect you from having your checking account emptied at the worst possible moment (like when you need to flee a natural or human made disaster, a domestic or foreign military occupation, or a virulent plague).

       You could potentially be put into debt by a criminal and have your wages perpetually garnished as a result.  Your only option as a citizen would be to work for cash under the table in order to survive, and the only way you could do that - by definition - is to be forced into criminality.

       I am from Canada, I have bad credit, just from student loans, no credit cards, and I am being sued for it, I am on social assistance and if they tried to force people on it to get RFID'd, I would be put into this boat, I would lose social assistance, and I would be forced into this literal situation.
      </p>
      <p>
       The second thing is I do work, but we haven't met with a judge yet, if they end up bleeding me (I live off of 1k a month total, and sadly that doesn't pay everything, do side jobs for xtra cash, nothing crazy), I am probably literally fucked.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yay Canada. I also suck for not paying my student loans, except I have never been in a financial situation where that has really been plausible.

       Why do you need a Radio Frequency ID because you have bad credit? What the hell would that solve?? I don't understand, what being sued for bad credit is, never heard of such things. Are you saying you were turned into a collection agency?   How can you be sued for something they know you dont have...None of this makes sense or adds up lol

       You have a college degree, but you only live off 12k a year? But also get social assistance?

       You arent fucked because it all sounds made up. No judge is going to strip you of your ability to feed and house yourself...

       It's kinda funny to me seeing people talk about RFID/microchipping, like, yeah that's really what we gotta worry about when Alibaba just unveiled 3D facial recognition cameras that you pay
       <em>
        by smiling at
       </em>
       . If we're talking pervasive, omnipresent tracking, that sort of thing looks infinitely more likely than literally microchipping every human being.
      </p>
      <p>
       P.s. how come nobody ever brings up Alibaba when we're listing megacorps? They've surpassed Walmart as the largest retailer in the world, and are literally worth ~$440bn. Food for thought y'all.

       Yeah it's fucked up. Kind of like how internet still isn't considered a utility. More and more aspects of our society are being purposefully structured to negate the protections offered to us by the Constitution, Bill of Rights, etc.

       Actually, originally their terms said that you gave up your right to sue
       <em>
        simply by using their site to find out if your info has been compromised.

       you still give up your right to sue if you sign up for their monitoring service.

       3rd of the nation should be issued new SSN. That process alone will take years. Which would put 3rd of the population in limbo for anything requiring SSN. Then 200k or so people are truly fucked, if the mean income households in the nation rests around $50,00 a year. That would create an imbalance of $10,000,000,000 for however long it would take to sort this out. Remember these companies control every aspect of our basis for financial institutions.
