       I think that it is more comforting to remain ignorant and to go along with the status quo than to challenge evil head on. I fear for my life and everyone else's here because if any of us really are right and manage to convince enough people of it, we will be killed. How is this idea comforting? How is it comforting to realize your own government kills innocent people for profit and power? It is the exact opposite. I stress more, I fear more, and I hate more because of it. I get that love is the way or whatever hippie bullshit you want to convince people is possible, but how can I remain comfortable and calm when I know in my heart that evil is winning, and by an insurmountable margin.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: To those that are religious on this sub, I find it hard to take your opinion seriously. You love to question reality and our government, but you don't question the biggest lie of all, religion. It is hypocritical and proves to me that you don't quite have your views and philosophy straight yet, which is fine, but what started this dark age was money, oil, and still (after 4000 years) religion. How can you believe that "jews are involved in the global banking system" and also "god allows this evil to exist, because it is his plan". Your logic and reasoning defy your own biblical texts, and if you were to go along with what your lovely little book says, then, at some point in your lives, you would rape and own slaves. You also wouldn't be able to wear more than one type of garment, regardless of which of the three religions you belong to. Either follow it to the letter or shut it. You're not a good (insert lie here) if you don't follow it to the letter, and if your god existed he would tell you that shit. I'm sick of hearing about letting this all slide because "there's life after death" and "its all apart of his plan, there's always a calm before the storm". This is a sub of reason, but instead you make it a circle jerk of idiocy.

       Or they want us of the topic so they don't have to cover things up anymore. Do you know how freely people would be fucking kids out there if none of us 'theorists' clung onto pizzagate? We are in control of what we cling to. More things are gonna happen.

       i think most of the ancient prophets where high on Syrian rue, and one of the active ingredients in Syrian Rue is
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmine">
        Harmine
       </a>
       . but the scientist who identified the properties of Harmine wanted to name it Telepathine.
      </p>
      <p>
       if you go and read on drug forums about Syrian Rue, they are all saying dont eat pork or drink alcohol a couple of days before that

       there where probably a lot of different types of psychedelics back then.
      </p>
      <p>
       different plants that has gone extinct by now. i even read that the ancient Egyptians used some bugs for there trips.

       take this for a example. Hitler dident die in the bunker, he probably fled to Argentina long before the conquest of Berlin.

       Hitler really did "escape" to South America.  The Antarctica stuff is disinfo, yes.  It is put there by the Establishment to "muddy the waters" and try to discredit the truth that Hitler and many other top Nazis were allowed to escape to South America.
      </p>
      <p>
       The reason this is hugely important is because it shows that Hitler was merely a controlled opposition agent working for the Rothschilds and other NWO chieftans.  They
       <em>
        allowed
       </em>
       Hitler and other top Nazis, after doing the work they were tasked to do, to live out their lives in secrecy.

       holding people accountable for their actions? I mean if someone steals my wallet I'm not going to go "aw shit, well god must've wanted it that way". I'm going to either chase after him and take it back myself or ensure the police catch the man responsible. Blame does a lot if it is directed appropriately. If you blame the right people, thats called justice. And if you have the capacity to blame yourself sometimes, you can grow and learn from your mistakes. So blame does a lot for me personally. Next.

       I agree.  I see a mass awakening happening right now.  For example, who would have ever thought that now probably 30-40% of the population knows that the globalist elite are a big pedophile cult (ie, from Pizzagate).  The dam broke with the 2016 Presidential election and Trump, with Trump focusing on "globalism", which caused huge numbers of people to begin talking and researching issues related to the NWO agenda, and leading people down the rabbit hole.

       I agree that ignorance is vastly more comforting than realization. But seeing the world as it is, doesn't have to be as dire as you make it out to be.
      </p>
      <p>
       Love is not the way, in the sense it is often understood (passivity, mainly). I'd see it more as the point between the three elements of love, bravery, and truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       Love in the sense of compassion makes you feel all the potential of humanity along with the perpetual failure to live up to it, largely due to sabotage of the many by the few. It takes brave convictions to withstand the downward current that was set for us and to embody your true calling despite fear or uncertainty. There's nothing hippie bullshit about someone with honest convictions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Besides, what makes you so sure that evil is winning by an insurmountable margin? It's always darkest before the dawn, isn't it? I can already hear the birds chirping. Maybe it's time to get yourself ready for a brand new day. Take care of yourself, brother/sister. Noone else will.

       OP, I generally agree with your post, but they aren't going to kill all of us.  There are too many of us.  Probably a good 30-40% of the population in the West are aware of various key aspects of the NWO conspiracy -- eg, knowing the truth about 9/11, Sandy Hook, Pizzagate, etc.  They only will kill key eyewitnesses to crimes (eg, key JFK assassination witnesses, etc).

       I think if you believe god exists you're missing the point. People don't start a nuclear war because having a nuclear weapon doesn't mean you want to use one. It's a political defense mechanism and an effective one. It allows you to assert power over those that don't have a nuke. God doesn't exist, nor has he ever. Just like democracy, capitalism, and the idea of good v. evil itself, god is a man-made creation to give comfort to those who can't explain it because they simply don't want to dig deep enough to find out. They're willing to take us all down with them, and they of all people know there isn't any higher power that will judge them for doing so. If any politician truly believed in hell or heaven, then they'd act upon it. But instead they use christ for votes, and use fear to control. If a fucking college kid can see how obvious this is, then someone who's spent their entire life studying how to manipulate and control would have a much more vast knowledge of tactics to use.

       And we're getting closer and closer to proving that none of that is true. In fact, most of what you said can be disproven, I just don't have a degree in String Theory, Physics, or anything of the sort. I assume that you don't either. We don't even know if the universe is finite because we cannot see past "The OBSERVABLE universe" because light physical has not reached us yet and probably won't be able to or already has passed out of view. This is pretty common knowledge. Assume that some force did start the big bang, how would he have then been able to control what occurs afterward if he wasn't apart of the physical universe? It would have to imply that there are multiple universes, multiple dimensions even, and to say that one person created all of that implies that he would have to have knowledge of how to do so prior to doing so. It would have to mean that whoever it was that created it evolved from an organism that because so advanced that it surpassed the need for a physical form. All of these assumptions don't have much evidence to back them up, so naw fam, god doesn't exist, and my generation is going to be the ones to prove it. It's just more about if you accept a fact or not, similar to whether or not you believe in climate change.

       its real independent of what we do. And since I have many family and friends who live in Houston and Miami, it is actually a real, terrifying thing. I fear it more than terrorism, considering that at least is controlled by a government. Hurricanes and natural disasters aren't and they'll displace and kill more people than any government ever could. You sound like an Alex Jones supporter or a McCarthian era nut with "globalist/communist agenda". Communism is a better idea, morally, than any other form of economics, its just not feasible in a population over a few million. And the human population should be lowered, significantly, but I don't have to do anything for that to occur, the 30ft of water that 3 billion people will have to endure in their homes will do just that. Either they migrate or die. And that's not just in Asia and the Mediterranean, thats the entire state of Florida, Louisiana, and cities like New York, Boston, Philadelphia, Washington D.C., and many more becoming entirely inhabitable within less than 50 years. Even if we extend our timestamp, its still going to happen within 200 years at an absolute guaranteed rate. So you can choose to believe it or not, it doesn't really matter. Nature doesn't give a fuck what you believe.

       Wow, you really have bought all the bullshit that the jewish/Communist Establishment sells, huh?  Climate change, communism, forcible lowering of human population.  Almost the whole lot of lies.
      </p>
      <p>
       The sea level is not rising by any significant margin. If at all, something negligible.   The north pole ice cap is not going to completely melt, as Al Gore predicted in 2009 that it would be gone by 2014.  It's all total fear-mongering.  The earth is now in a cooling phase, and has been for at least the last 15 years.  The "scientists" were caught doctoring the data to fake a "global warming trend" that was not actually occuring.

       It is fear mongering, but for good reason. I can't change your opinion, and honestly I shouldn't, the world is much better when there is a fool to laugh at. Al Gore ain't no prophet, data is ever changing, and if anything, there is certainly no shortage of uneducated people, and you prove that very well. I've been anti-establishment my whole life, and thats any establishment. If anything, I would enjoy seeing us implement a system where, if you didn't supply any benefit to society (i.e. labor, ideas, love, wisdom), you would be either exiled, jailed, or killed. I would love to see us take intellect that seriously. There are too many people, and too many stupid people that procreate. If the climate change doesn't do it, then I'll vote for someone who will. I don't believe communism is able to survive in any country with more than ~3 million people and stated that, so personally I am not a supporter of communism in that sense. I don't really support any of the -ism's because they all teach the "Us v. Them" mentality, and that is the mentality of a slave. I used to be jewish and rejected that faith because it makes no sense and is rooted in discrimination, but so is christianity and islam. You constantly bicker about petty differences, and to the ones who are well versed enough to see past it, it's just taken as a dark joke. You're nothing more than a pawn, so am I. Your bones will look exactly the same to a jew and a communist, and you can't do anything to change that. So when people look at our corpses in the aftermath, they will not be able to tell the difference between a jew and a christian or a communist and a capitalist, they will just view you and I as another poor stupid soul who couldn't see the error of their ways. And once your heart stops beating and you take your last breath, you won't realize just how petty you are, because you'll be dead, and thats it. Blank. Nada. You can bicker all you want, but the world will keep on spinning without us. If you want to witness real fear, real pain and anguish, then just keep breathing, my friend. I assure you that one vice or another will consume you as it has consumed all of us.

       my life has meaning and purpose because I'm able to imagine ways to create that purpose without an external force. Your life has meaning to you, and that is about it. Same goes for me. The only difference here is education.

       Just remember, Hoover spent his entire career claiming there was no such thing as organized crime. Consider the implications. Then consider the implications when sources like the Atlantic claim "there is no deep state."

       there is nothing after death, so I value life greatly, as should everyone. It is the idea that there is something after death that allows us to justify letting someone die or taking someone's life in the first place. If we knew nothing came after for a fact and accepted it, then we would be much more concerned about the future for our kids and about how we live in the present.

       Really? You believe we kill each other because we collectively believe there is something after death? Or do you think maybe people are just losing control of their emotions and acting impulsively when they commit murder?

       no, saying its complicated is implying there are many factors that go into the decision to kill, which there are, that is a fact, that is psychology 101. In fact, most of what I "make up" is based on primary sources, first hand accounts, and statistical data regarding specific behaviors (which are often shaky as human nature itself is hard to analyze on a graph). I think I'm analyzing and logically thinking about this, but that's just me

       Given that you replied within
       <em>
        two minutes
       </em>
       , you cannot possibly have watched even half of the video (even at 2x speed). In other words, you have judged the video by its title, proving the exact point I was making.
       <strong>
        Thank you

       I skipped around to the main points of his argument.  Lmao does my response not address what he is asserting, that rockets aren’t aerodynamically correct enough to fly the way that they do.  I skipped to the part where he was explaining they the way rockets fly makes no sense.

       I didn’t Judge it at face value, I’m just
       <em>
        really
       </em>
       good at wading through bullshit.  I do plan to watch the entire video when I have time, and always planned to do so.
