    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>It seems to me that they make changes just to make changes. </p>

<p>They do it in order to entice impressionable masses; the public who&#39;s been plugged in to the western consumerist lifestyle; the gotta-have-gotta-have lifestyle.  If you get the citizenry to be brainwashed into identifying their self worth with the type of material possessions they have, then its easy to get them hooked on whatever happens to be the next item you offer in a planned obsolescence paradigm.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>They do not make changes to make it better.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is done on purpose so that they don&#39;t have to work too hard if at all to convinced the citizen that they need &quot;The Next Big Thing!&quot; - when in reality it&#39;s the exact same thing as yesterday, just wrapped in a slightly different package.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It is very annoying.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What&#39;s really annoying isn&#39;t so much that TPTB do this, but that the citizenry keep falling for it over and over again.  TPTB wouldn&#39;t do it if the citizenry didn&#39;t buy into their fake shit.</p>

<p>TPTB are shit, but I almost can&#39;t blame them for continuing to peddle shit because the masses simply keep lapping it up, so it&#39;s pretty easy pickings for the corporate empire.  Again, TPTB suck, but the masses are also complicit for taking it all in with little to no question.  The system wouldn&#39;t work if we didn&#39;t to a significant enough extent support it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You get used to doing something one way but they change it and it is actually worse now.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Part of the deceit also involves planned confusion - which gets the masses to become dependent upon the newest technology since their dependence upon it often makes them (the consumer) no longer literate in the previous system.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It makes no sense at all.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It certainly doesn&#39;t make any sense from the point of view of what actually works and allows a civilization to move forward, grow, evolve, and become more intelligent, but it makes total sense from the perspective of a manipulator intent upon making sure the population remains dependent and largely confused and dumbed down.</p>

<p>A desktop, like the one I use for digital art and graphic design, isnt something I would bring with me to a client to show them concepts or have them sign agreements.</p>

<p>The smartphone i keep in my pocket that I use for streaming music, taking snap shots, creating notes, and so forth isn&#39;t something I would illustrate the cover of a book on.</p>

<p>both are tools, both are better at somethings and worse at others.  knowing when and how to use the right tool is key to success</p>

    <div class="md"><p>laptops dont have the computing power, upgradability, or storage options that a desktop does.  they don&#39;t all come with sim cards either and even if they did you still need a data plan.  at that point you might as well just get that smartphone and leave your real work horse safe at home... not to mention a comparably powerful laptop will cost just as much (if not more) than a deaktop/smartphone combo.</p>

<p>i can tell at this point you&#39;re just some out-of-touch guy that doesnt even understand the topic hes debating.  I get it though.  youre being contrarian and enjoy the old days.  My dad has the same mindset.  He doesn&#39;t even own a cell phone at all but then again he doesnt understand (or even care to understand) the potential of one.  just like you.</p>

<p>i have faith that once you educate yourself on the pros and cons of smart devices itll become clear to you</p>

<p>2 year old phones still cost about  3-5x as much as your $100 dollar one.  Speaking of phones that are &quot;practically fee&quot; two years down the road how much do you think the phone you have will be worth?</p>

<p>if youre happy with your phone then more power to you, but there are many people out here who take advantage of the features and power of these $1000 dollar devices and do get thier monies worth from them.  My note has saved me so much time while in the field.  not having to go back and forth to a computer is worth the cost alone.</p>

<p>My friend has a wonderfully advanced smart phone of some kind. It can let him play online games like hearthstone so smoothly and the access to the internet is so great. Its so good and gives him such capabilities that he&#39;s able to play hearthstone all he wants such that by the time he intends to get in touch with me his battery has run out and the phone has become completely useless.</p>

<p>How much use would you ascribe to an electric abacus? Something which was perfectly capable of performing all the functions needed of it but by spending more money on it you you can a whole host of functions that are unnecessary and are detrimental to the original purpose of the item.</p>

<p>Why would you want such a feature when a pass code could be safe enough? </p>

<ul>
<li>If for &quot;convenience&quot;, how lazy are you that no longer want to introduce a passcode?
If for &quot;increased security&quot;, why would you need it for? Isn&#39;t it enough with a 4 digit passcode? OK, increase the passcode numbers to 6. Boom, significantly increased security.

<p>The Israeli firm got into that phone because it was an older model without the Secure Enclave, so they could mirror the NAND and make as many attempts as they need so a weak passcode wouldn&#39;t take too long to bruteforce. There was a rumour about a theorised USB signing exploit too, thought the potential for that has since been fixed.</p>

<p>Current legal precedent holds that forcing an arrestee to use their own fingerprint to unlock the phone does NOT violate Fifth Amendment protections against self incrimination.</p>

<p>This will be held the same for FaceID (which also creates a 3-D map of your face; from snapchat to FaceApp to this, they&#39;re really going after that facial recognition, but that&#39;s a whole different issue).</p>

<p>US citizens within the country? I&#39;m not necessarily doubting you, but I&#39;d like to see the case. There are different laws and protections for non-citizens, as well as for citizens entering the country. </p>

<p>There&#39;s also the issue of being able to afford an attorney who can properly make the 5th Amendment case. A public defender, even if he has the knowhow, probably doesn&#39;t have the time to prepare and argue it. </p>

<p>Probably the most high-profile case.</p>

<p>There hasn&#39;t been any Supreme Court decision saying that providing a password counts under the 5th Amendment, so it&#39;s still an open question and different courts have ruled different ways, it&#39;s certainly not something that you should rely on if you don&#39;t want to spend time in jail.</p>

<p>This is the most doublespeak part of the whole article. If they already know there&#39;s CP on the drives, to the point where they can prove it in a court, then they have no need to actually access the drives. </p>

<p>It will be interesting to see how SCOTUS will rule on this, if ever. For whatever else one may think of Scalia, he was pretty consistent on favoring 4th and 5th Amendment protections. </p>

<p>Makes me want to look into rubber hose again. I think a lot of people forget that before WikiLeaks, Assange was already a pretty innovative developer and privacy rights advocate. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Now I&#39;m definitely no lawyer, but I think the article might just be explaining the case badly.  I think the argument basically comes down to whether or not refusing to hand over a password is obstructing justice or self-incrimination.</p>

<p>Say you&#39;re running a company and you&#39;re being charged with fraud.  The court subpoenas your financial records and in response you go and delete them all.  You weren&#39;t acting under the 5th amendment, you were obstructing justice because you were destroying specific evidence that you were required to provide.</p>

<p>No lets say you&#39;re accused of fraud and the police say &quot;give us any fraudulent records you have.&quot;  In this case you&#39;re fully entitled to refuse to answer their question under the 5th amendment, because answering their question would be an admission of guilt, and they don&#39;t have a subpoena for specific evidence.</p>

<p>I think the article is trying to say that the prosecution is saying that they&#39;re requesting specific evidence on that computer that the defendant is refusing to hand over, while the defense is saying that the act of providing the password would be self-incriminating testimony and can&#39;t be compelled due to the 5th amendment.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If I understand correctly, they can pretty commonly force you to unlock your device using biometric means (face id, thumbprint, etc) because you &quot;don&#39;t have a reasonable expectation of privacy&quot; using such unlock schemes. A passcode is marginally better, though I remember reading they can use the same justification in some cases as with biometric means.</p>

<p>The strongest protection in terms of legal precedent is using an actual password- as in letters, numbers and symbols. If the phone shows it wants an actual password (bringing up the full keyboard instead of just numbers etc), its entitled the same protections a computer would have. Open to being challenged on this so correct me if I&#39;m wrong. </p>

<p>I have my phone encrypted, a bootup password, and I actually use a password instead of a passcode or biometric unlock. I figure thats the best I can do, although I dont use my phone for anything important- I use my home computer for that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The first part is correct, they can easily compel you the unlock your device through biometric means.  The second part is still an open question, there is not a strong precedent that using a password gives you any legal protection.

<p>You may be correct that ultimately the issues are similar from a technological standpoint, but that&#39;s not how legal precedent works. </p>

<p>Forcing someone to decrypt a hard drive by court order is a completely different issues than forcing someone to unlock their phone via password upon arrest. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hadn&#39;t heard this, but that&#39;s fantastic. The face recognition is no more a boon to law enforcement than Touch ID or in the old days before passcodes were even an option on iphones. You think a cop couldn&#39;t just force your fingerprint any easier than they could force you to look a the phone? OP&#39;s premise is ridiculous.</p>

<p>Apple has gone out of their way before to stick it to the feds (see: San Bernardino shooter&#39;s phone) when it comes to protecting end-user privacy. Sounds like the 5-tap feature is a huge win for us. </p>

<p>The amount of time they put into this facial recognition hardware/software is amazing.  It&#39;s shooting a projector at your face.  It can adapt to you growing facial hair, wearing glasses, wearing a hat, etc.  </p>

<p>Once you&#39;re &quot;in&quot; the system, there is no hiding.  You&#39;re in the system.  You&#39;re a criminal?  You want to run? Oh here, Apple has provided LE with every possible combination you could look like in a disguise.  Grew a beard? Wearing glasses? Wearing a hat? YOU&#39;RE FUCKED.</p>

<p>People are willingly going to shell out 1000+ dollars in order to aid the government, and allow basically unauthorized searches into your phone.</p>

<p>Say you get pulled over.  Oh I think you&#39;re texting and driving.  Boom, they unlock your phone and have full access.  Fuck.  This is irritating and horrible, all at the same time.</p>

Unless your trafficking child porn or conspiring a murder you really don&#39;t have anything the police are remotely interested in, with the exception of you filming their misdeeds.
