       <strong>
        and they still say soon

       Don't place links to Snopes, CNN or so called fact checkers, because they are fake news and I will call it out as so.

      <p>
       There are several very realistic options to charge/impeach Trump with a crime:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         <strong>
          Obstruction of justice
         </strong>
         . Comey firing, and very possible that there was criminal intentions behind the firing of Sally Yates and Preet Bharara. As well as pressuring James Comey to drop the investigation of Mike Flynn.

          Financial crimes involving the Trump Org
         </strong>
         . The Trump Org has been laundering hundreds of millions for Kazak and Russian mafia organisations since 2005. Trump himself has been paid millions from these deals as well as retained ownership in the projects involved in the laundering operations. During these deals, Trump and the Russian and Kazak mafia associates committed large scale tax fraud, embezzlement, money laundering, and investment fraud. The largest operation was done in NY state, making it impossible for Trump to pardon state crimes involving tax fraud and money laundering. Even aside from the Kazak and Russian mafia operations, Donald Sr and Ivanka were heavily involved in a laundering operations ran by the Transportation Minister of Azerbaijan, who has used construction projects around the same time period to launder money for the Iranian Revolutionary Guard.

         <strong>
          Changing campaign and party positions under direction of Russian intelligence
         </strong>
         . This was done primarily through Paul Manafort. During the campaign, Paul Manafort was not paid a cent from campaign finances. I don't understand how this is not bigger, but Paul Manafort was in debt $35 million during the campaign to Oleg Deripaska and Dmytro Firtash, both figures which are heavily associated with Russian mafia organisations. Deripaska went on to essentially forgive Manafort's debt right before he became campaign manager, effectively paying him close to $10 million while he was paid nothing from the campaign. Manafort was also actively laundering millions during the campaign he previously received from work he did in Ukraine for Rinat Akhmetov Oleg Deripaska. While this was all happening, Manafort organised the efforts at the RNC to change the parties official stance on arming the Ukrainian army in their civil war. Several Manafort associates were engaged in these efforts and have went on the record acknowledging their involvement. Konstantin Kilimnik - a 'former' GRU officer - has admitted his involvement in the policy changing process. Rick Gates would have likely been involved in the process considering how much he previously worked with Manafort and Kilimnik in Ukraine as well. Aside from the RNC platform change, the June meeting at Trump Tower regarding the Magnitsky act is also another instance related to illegal influence peddling and lobbying. There is also a larger instance that likely ties into the big picture with the active negotiations by Trump himself to sign onto a Trump Tower Moscow deals while he was actively in the campaign. These Trump Tower efforts involved someone who was also very well connected to the Russian mafia.

       You are moving the goal posts. The reasons I specified contained publicly available information regarding high crimes committed during the campaign, after the campaign, and crimes that Russian intelligence would have used for blackmail. These crimes would be, as you put it, '
       <em>
        will get Trump out of office

       Nixon was brought up on 3 articles of impeachment. So by precedent, you are able to impeach a president on multiple crimes, as well as crimes that were committed before coming to power.

Why don't you take the time and give him a real answer to why you think these 3 different scenarios are bullshit and why your beloved president is not guilty. I mean you are Adkin gor it and when people give you the answer you ignore it?? What kind of a behavior is that?  If you want to troll, go somewhere else

       Speaking of the Magnitsky Act, did you see that Trump just gave the Secretary of the Treasury and Secretary of State the power to add or remove any names they see fit from the Magnitsky Act financial and visa restrictions? This will allow allow Putin's wealthy buddies to clear out any assets they still had tied up in America without Trump directly getting involved, since Congress had effectively blocked him from doing so. I'm not sure why this isn't bigger news or why it hasn't been posted here yet.

       I agree, he has actually seemed pretty reasonable as Secretary of State so far. But wasn't ExxonMobil effected pretty heavily by these sanctions? Tillerson has a lot of incentive to start removing names from the list and dismantling the sanctions in any way he can. Although it looks like Tillerson only has power over visas and Mnuchin is in charge of the financial side of the Magnitsky Act. I have no clue where Mnuchin stands on all of this.

       So why would Trump delegate the authority to these two people then? If they weren't going to do
       <em>
        something
       </em>
       there would be no need to give them the power at all. Unless they aren't planning on removing any names at all from the list, but adding more names to it. Certainly there are a few business rivals of Trump, Putin, or other associated billionaires that could really be hurt by adding their names to the sanctions.

       You keep posting that in this thread but it's an awful argument. Maybe Mueller just hires people who are professional enough not to leak anything while the investigation is still ongoing. Just because Trump's Whitehouse leaks like a sieve doesn't mean every branch of government has the same problem.

       If this is a serious question, what sort of evidence are you looking for? Something like a secret meeting between his family, campaign manager, and other campaign staff and several Russian agents? Or how about the huge number of people on his staff who have connections to Putin, Russian oligarchs, Russian mobsters, Russian businesses, or some combination of all of these? Or how about the numerous members of his campaign, staff, and family who have lied about meetings, phone calls, discussions, contacts, and past affiliations with prominent Russians? Or how about the fact that congress had to pass a bill to prevent Trump from removing the sanctions on Russia since they didn't trust him not to do that, and then he gave that power to two of his staff members anyway? Every single one of these events all come back Russia.

       Yes. Exactly. This never happened. The woman Don Jr met had absolutely NO RELATION to the Russian government and was previously paid by the DNC. Her FB page had pictures from Hillary fundraisers lol.

       In America, there's this thing called "Freedom of Association" and it's part of the 1st amendment. Ever heard of it? Because you have done business with Russian people in the past doesn't make you a Russian spy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Are you some kind of communist? Do you think people should be thrown in jail for "Association" when they've been friends in the past with a criminal? What if your best friend right now kills someone ten years from now. Will you be in any way guilty for that crime? I mean, you did do business/have a friendship with that murderer so....

       A bill that Congress passed proves there was collusion? Now you're going off the deep end bud.

       Fine, I'll take your bait even though I know there is literally nothing I can say that would change your mind.

      <p>
       -You say no information was exchanged in the meeting but that is coming from the two people who repeatedly denied the meeting even took place. Then when that was proven to be a lie, they changed their story to it wasn't about Hillary. Then when THAT was proven to be a lie, they changed their story again. Why on earth would you trust this version of their story to suddenly be the truth?
      </p>
      <p>
       -Freedom of association is the best you can come up with? The reason I mentioned that was to show how closely tied so many prominent people in this administration are with Russians. Trump himself has a long history of working with Russian mobsters. So now that you admit they all associate, what more evidence would you like to take it from "association" to "collusion"? Combined with all of these other meetings, emails, and repeated denials and lies, this has gone from smoke to fire.
      </p>
      <p>
       -It's not the bill, it's Trump's attempt to subvert the bill to keep messing with the sanctions that is the problem. You even included that sentence in your quote.

       That's how these threads usually go. "There's no proof of ______, go ahead and try to prove me wrong!" Then when people do provide proof they either respond with "That's not real proof!" or they just ignore it completely. Notice that OP mostly only responded to comments that agree with him or that are easy to dismiss.

       He basically responded to my original post by moving goal posts and saying I gave too much information about crimes committed by Trump and I should narrow it does to one specific crime with regards to collusion. He said that having evidence of multiple crimes is evidence of a witch hunt.

       The obstruction of justice charges are directly tied to Trump. Those are easy to point out. Plus they have the most impeach precedent behind them.
      </p>
      <p>
       The financial crimes are also very easy to point out too. Trump made millions from huge money laundering operations from 2005 to his presidency, when he dropped all of the remaining deals because of the 'conflicts of interest'. Look at the Trump Soho development project. That entire corporate structure reeks of Kazak and Russian mafia involvement. That's not including Baku and Batumi deals.

       Trump had the right to fire comey for not following protocol during the elections, but waiting to do so makes his gun very smokey.  IANAL but
       <em>
        proving
       </em>
       obstruction of justice seems difficult. We'll see.
      </p>
      <p>
       Any financial crimes (I'm sure there are multiple) that were committed before inauguration will have to wait until his time after office.  You can't prosecute a sitting president for "petty" crimes.
      </p>
      <p>
       That is unless his enterprise  does some stupid, like a big foreign deal, whilst he is in office.  Which is quite possible.

       Enough to convict of obstruction? I mean it wasn't sworn testimony but he clearly admits where his head was at when he made the decision. Factor that in with him directly asking members of Congress to squash any investigation and I think it's a pretty clear cut case. He publicly pissed all over Sessions after he realized what the meaning of recusal was.
      </p>
      <p>
       I dunno, I mean what could someone sitting on the fence need more to convince them than what's already publicly known.

        IANAL but proving obstruction of justice seems difficult. We'll see.

      <p>
       Asking the head of the FBI to drop a criminal investigation into your National Security Adviser is obstruction of justice. There is no grey area there.
      </p>

        Any financial crimes (I'm sure there are multiple) that were committed before inauguration will have to wait until his time after office.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Clinton V Jones already established that a sitting president is not immune from litigation stemming from before they were president. So Trump is absolutely vulnerable to litigation regarding financial crimes committed before he became president. His children were also involved in those crimes, which opens another area of possible obstruction if Trump intervened or intervenes in any state level crime investigations regarding those deals.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        That is unless his enterprise does some stupid, like a big foreign deal, whilst he is in office. Which is quite possible.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Those actually would not be of any legal liability to him considering he is not operating the Trump Org while he is president.

       This election already did that for us. All conspiracies aside, it was a shit show. We somehow ended up with two candidates who were each overwhelmingly hated by about half of the country. Out of all of the eligible people in the country these were the two we ended up choosing between. That felt like the real mockery of our democracy.

       I'm not sure what it's like where you are, but in America they generally have to go through trials and investigations.  The more serious the crime and/or more connected the defendant, the longer it can take to gather more evidence.  Mueller is investigating, though it might take even longer before anything concrete is released to the public.  It's just media conjecture right now until a trial starts.

       Right.  Until Mueller's team goes to trial the public basically only has limited information on exactly what is being done.  There's some educated guesses based on who he's hiring and who he's been questioning, so it seems like Manafort might be screwed, but as it's an ongoing investigation they're trying to be tight-lipped about it.  Not sure if your country's news will cover it, but I'm sure if you keep up with various news outlets online you will likely see notice of the trial when it commences.

       Oh by Trump Jr tried to help daddy. I wonder what people would say if Hillary's daughter did this, nothing obviously. You can't impeach a man for what his son has done. According to even MSM reports they can't take action realistically and the laws of the FEC protects Trump Jr. You are legally within your right to communicate with foreign nations, but not allowed to receive financial help. Which Hillary receive plenty of financial help let's talk about real collusion.

       No, you are not allowed to receive anything of value from a foreign agent, info is valuable. Trump crafted the lie, knew of the meeting and covered it up, that is all illegal. If this was all okay, they would not have lied multiple times about who was involved, what was discussed and if anything was exchanged.

       If you want to critize Trump let's make sure Hillary gets arrested. If something happens to Trump but not Hillary then that will lead to bias situation. I don't see anyone here talk about Hillary's collusion but only Trump. I think I am starting to see who many people here serve.

       Trump himself said that he would lock hillary up when in office but still didn't because there is nothing to talk about that is even close to happened with him. Information can definitely be argued to be illegal and even if that is proven not to be, the cover up is definitely illegal. The dirt was promised, he accepts the meeting, the lawyer they met with lobbied to end the magnitsky act, later in the election dirt is released, just this week magnistky act actions are being made. It is a pretty clear line from just public articles and knowledge that it is extremely possible that information was traded for international laws being changed.

       But while I hope we remain to be not bias in this discussion let's also mention the facts on Trump Jr "meeting". We know the Russian Lawyer who he met was allowed into the US on a special occasion from Obama AG Loretta Lynch, we also know the Russian Lawyer who he met also has special ties into the Obama admin, we also know the translator between Trump Jr and the Russian Lawyer also was part of the Obama Admin.
      </p>
      <p>
       So between the facts we know about this meeting. Could we also come to the concept that the Obama Admin secretly supported Trump and his family in this case or was Trump Jr set up?

       What if instead the Obama admin doing all these things was just non biased. They let in people on a case by case basis and don't look for political motives to block entry into the US. I don't think they could have known the meeting would happen and she did have other reasons for entering the US, I think some lawsuit. Trump Jr. was not set up, the emails show he wanted this meeting and he knew who was involved, he himself has never stated that he was set up nor has anyone in the meeting I believe.

       I mean, I have the reasons for the Jr. meeting from his own emails and they are horrible, combime that with the lies and it leads to a massive coverup of a hidden meeting. There is no other evidence for alternate theories so they seem much less possible and even stupid, like they set this meeting up then don't tell anyone and use obama era people to conduct it? That seems dumb.

       CBS reports Obama officials were at Trump Jr meeting with the Russian lawyer. Interpator came directly from the Obama admin. As for the meeting being hidden and or lied about. Was it not Assange who told Trump Jr to go ahead and reveal the meeting happen? Then Trump Jr released the email publically? Not sure where the lies and secrecy is because Trump Jr has been very open about it before it became Main Stream News.

       First, they said they never had met with any russians during the campaign, then news came out from I believe the NYT that a meeting took place at Trump tower. Actually I found a timeline

       He doesnt even tell the truth in the reveal, he says it was a 3 person meeting with goldstone, the russian and himself. After that the press lets them trickle truth for days before hitting them again and again with the actual events that they learned about. It went from a 3 person worthless meeting to an 8+ person meeting where at least one envelope was exchanged and Trump had a hand in crafting the apology his son gave out.

       I've yet to hear what was so awful about Trump Jr.'s meeting. Literally anyone with half a brain in that position would jump at the opportunity for opposition research. I would have done the same thing, and there is nothing wrong with the meeting.

       They said they had dirt on Hillary, and Trump Jr. was willing to listen. That isn't collusion or wrong in any way. If you think otherwise, you have been fooled by MSM propaganda.

       As a lawyer, WTF are you talking about? That is absolutely not true. If someone from another country says they have dirt on a candidate, you are absolutely allowed to listen to what they have to say. The fact that you think otherwise is pretty disturbing. Where do you get your info? Because you're clearly being fed fake news.

       Ah, I knew this was your line of thinking. Its flawed, though, because discussing something that might make a candidate look bad would not qualify as a thing of value under the Federal Election Campaign Act. This should be obvious to you since charges were never brought against Don Jr. and all legal experts agree that he did nothing illegal.

       So not all legal experts, and Jr. has testified about this meeting so they are/were looking to charge him, they just have not done it yet. And if the info wasn't of value, why were they discussing "russian adoption" which is just code word for the magnitsky act, it makes it seem like they were giving them something back.

       It was not short and introductory, Manafort and Kushner were involved from the start instead of "stopping by", it was specifically campaign related, he knew exactly who he was meeting, and he had not revealed everything when he said he did on Hannity. Does that help you see the lies?

       Nope. And no evidence that Trump colluded with Russia will ever come out. Mark my words. Otherwise, it would have already. There is no way that sort of info wouldn't get leaked. Don't be naive.
      </p>
      <p>
       This investigation is just a fishing expedition, anyway. It makes no sense to investigate something to see if you can find evidence for it. I say we investigate John McCain for assassinating JFK. Just because we have no evidence that he did doesn't mean that it doesn't exist! These investigations take time, we will find out when John McCain is put on trial.

       I'm not sure, possibly. I can't see the account history since it is suspended but I can see my RES tag on his name ("racist trump supporter") and the comment I tagged him from (one where he is talking about the war on white people and how white people are just genetically smarter than black people).

       Trump just gave the authority to remove names from the Magnitsky Act restrictions to his Secretary of Treasury and Secretary of State. This is what Russia has wanted all along since so many of Putin's very wealthy allies had their American financial investments frozen by the act. Congress had passed a bill that prevented Trump from personally lifting these and other sanctions so he thinks he has found a loophole by delegating the power to his subordinates. Even if congress determines this is in violation of their previous bill, it won't matter since it will likely be too late to stop the Russians from recovering all of their financial assets. Let's not forget that Secretary of State Rex Tillerson was also the head of ExxonMobil who had a very large oil investment in Russia blocked by these sanctions as well. He wouldn't have any motive to mess with these sanctions now would he?

       So they infiltrated government to better relations with the Russians? Due to NWO globalists in our government fucking over numerous people from various countries.

       I didn't imply anything. You have to admit that there have been leaks in the Trump Russia thing every week or so, the fact that no one has leaked anything damning is pretty telling. If they had any evidence that the Russians actually interfered with the election then trump would be impeached like yesterday

       This is not true.
      </p>
      <p>
       The majority of "leaks" that have been coming from the investigation revolve around what people have said about it or what they think about it.  None of the actual evidence has leaked because:
      </p>
      <p>
       1) it doesn't exist. This probably isn't the case, as the investigation has gone pretty far. Remember, systematically a lot of stuff from the Steele document has been proven correct.
2) the investigators don't leak evidence because this is what they do professionally.

       It doesn't matter whether anything leaks or not. If nothing leaks, Trump supporters say "Aha! They don't have anything."
      </p>
      <p>
       If something does leak, they're just going to cry "Fake News!!!" so what's the point?
      </p>
      <p>
       And as Boxmasterman says, these guys don't leak, because they're the best in the business, and their reputations would be destroyed if stuff started getting out, costing them and their firms millions.

       Have you met the media? I've been saying this on other posts, but anyone confused by the media needs to watch "Network" a movie made in 1976. The news was changed from a journalistic model to a profit model because managers and middle men took charge of the programming.

       Hi there OP, why do you support the Russian interference in the U.S. election?
      </p>
      <p>
       And why do you post the pro-Russian talking point that there is no evidence when Trump's own son is evidence of that co-operation?
      </p>
      <p>
       When, several U.S. Congress members are openly supporting the Russian's?
      </p>
      <p>
       This is just more narrative dialog control and it is shameful that this sub is so anti-American and pro-Russian.

       Collision is one crime they are looking into. And as you say, after a crime is committed an investigation happens. And guess what? An investigation is not only happening, but continues to grow.

       Meeting with Don Jr, Flynn's numerous meetings. Lots of lies and cover ups, which is evidence. That's just some of the publicly known stuff. Hence, an investigation. Watergate took years for the case, investigations are not instant.

       Don jr meeting was a cold call from a random Russian chick. This PROVES there was no collision. How? Because if trump had a direct line to the kremlin, don jr would never have met with the chick to begin with, there'd be no need to.

       That has NOTHING to do with Russia if so. If they try to get him on that, it will prove he never colluded. Because if he did collude, they'd wouldn't have to go the laundering route

       It is still secret, but you do know that EU intelligence agencies reported to US intelligence there were meetings happening as early as March of 2016. Did you forget why Flynn resigned, why Sessions had to recuse himself? And why the flap about the Comey firing?
      </p>

       And why has the former head of Homeland Security been put in place as Trump's Chief of Staff?

       Ahhhhh still SECRET. Riiiiighhhhhttt. Anytime now that SECRET evidence is gonna be released and Trump will be taken to jail right? How many years will go by before you could believe that nothing exists? Say in 3 years, there's still nothing. Will you still be talking about this? Believing the Russia lie? Will you take it to your grave? What a mindless sheep. SECRET EVIDENCE from the deep state and you believe it lol

       Is Trump installing the "Russian System" in America????? LOL. I don't want the Russian system. I want the classic American system. That's why I voted Trump, that's why I'm 1000% behind him. There is not a single thing he's done that indicates to me he's Pro-Communist.
      </p>
      <p>
       All he's done is help the working class of ALL RACES, GENDERS, AND ETHNICITIES. Ending the TPP saved the working class in this country. Securing the border again will save the working class and raise wages. Trump has done nothing but good (so far) for ALL American citizens. (Sucks that it hasn't been good for illegals but they are welcome back if they follow the rules.)

       Oh that stock thing is a manipulated bubble. The target is pension funds and especially private IRAs and 401Ks.

      <p>
       The income reduction is by undoing the Obama Executive orders that required all those privatized for profit from tax money contractors to pay their employees a $10 minimum wage, those contractors can now return to the pitiful $7.50/hr minimum wage.

       You sound like you really care about wages. Do you also support Sanctuary Cities and DACA? Illegal immigration lowers wages. Even Karl Marx wrote about how the Capitalists use the "Unemployed Labor Army" of immigrants to oppress the working class.

       Illegal immigration oppresses the working class proletariat but liberals continue to use their privilege to fool you into voting for them.

       How can Trump "cut wages"? lol. If someone doesn't have the skills to make $10 hour, then they don't deserve that money. Minimum wage is complete bullshit. If minimum wage worked, why not just make it $100/hour for everyone? Why doesn't anyone do that, can you answer?

       Seattle literally just tried $15/hour and it HURT WORKERS. Proof:

       "Socialism makes herd animals out of men", Nietzsche. Only the people that demand "Equality for all!" are cattle. Men are not equal and when we try to force it to be that way, everything collapses. Id rather have FREEDOM than free healthcare and free college.

       Leftists want to be taken care of by Daddy. Conservatives want freedom and liberty. That's why I'm on the right.

       Never before has Wikileaks been accused of being a Russian cutout. Not when they released information on the wars in Middle East, not when they revealed torture info. Now they release info on Hillary Clinton, media claims Wikileaks is Putin's puppet and the gullible zombies repeat the lies.

       Do you remember this email to John podesta from Michael foreman. Foreman was the executive from Citibank during 08 presidential election and he sent podesta who was chair of Obama's transition team a list of people and the cabinet positions he wanted them in. Check the attachments.
      </p>
      <p>
       The cabinet list ended up being almost entirely right. Holder for Justice Department, Napolitano for Homeland Security, Robert Gates for Defense, Rahm Emanuel for COS, Peter Orszag for OMB, Arne Duncan for Education, Eric Shinseki for Veterans Affairs, Kathleen Sebelius for HHS, Melody Barnes for the Domestic Policy Council, and more. For the Treasury, three possibilities were on the list: Robert Rubin, Larry Summers, and Timothy Geithner.
      </p>
      <p>
       He sent this email on Oct 6 a full month before Obama was actually elected. So we have this executive from Citigroup who received the largest bailout during the financial crisis and he picks Obamas cabinet.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you think Obama ever wanted to see these Wall Street executives face charges or do you think he wanted to keep the "too big to jail" saying alive?

       I understand your point but the presidency is the most powerful office on this planet. Impeachment isn't some minor, insignificant thing. Any investigation like this shouldn't be quick for the sake of being quick. The investigation into Watergate took YEARS.
      </p>
      <p>
       People are too wrapped up in the collusion aspect of this when Mueller has been given authority to go after
       <em>
        any
       </em>
       criminal act he may uncover during his investigation. That means tax fraud or money laundering charges for Paul Manafort and charges of lying to the FBI for Michael Flynn.
      </p>
      <p>
       Realistically, collusion could not even be the outcome here. We won't know until the investigation is over.

       Russian collusion seems likely, but there is no solid public proof of that right now. Obstruction of justice and emoluments clause violations are basically public knowledge, though. Combined with the fact that Trump is really bad at the job of being president
       <em>
        regardless
       </em>
       of his politics, it seems pretty reasonable to want to impeach him already, before the verdict on the
       <em>

       treasonous stuff is in.

       What a disingenuous misreading of what I said. Because of the President's position in the legal system, it's basically impossible for the President to be "found guilty of" a crime outside of impeachment. Impeachment is the mechanism through which these crimes would be punished. So you're essentially saying "You think Trump did something that deserves impeachment? How come he hasn't been impeached then HUH???" You can't use whether he's been "found guilty" of these things as your baseline for whether he should even be suspected for them.
      </p>
      <p>
       I say it's basically common knowledge that he
       <em>
        did
       </em>
       them because they are public actions that anyone can easily see happening. In the case of firing Comey being obstruction of justice, he even personally admitted his reasoning for doing it (to interfere with the Russia investigation targeting his campaign) in a publicly broadcasted interview.

      <blockquote>

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I hope this happened, but I haven't seen any proof of it yet. In fact, the Trump administration recently admitted that the accusation that Trump tower was wiretapped was a completely fabricated lie.
      </p>
      <blockquote>

      <p>
       Depending on who had the proof, and at what time. Mueller's investigation is not complete, so there's no reason to believe that any unique information he has would be known by the public. Because it's not
       <em>
        supposed
       </em>
       to be. Saying "if any proof exists, we would know about it" is tantamount to saying "it's impossible for any organization to keep information secret", which is pretty close to the conclusion "conspiracies cannot exist", which I find very interesting for this sub.

       You must have missed when McCabe said that Comey's firing did not affect the Russia investigation in the senate hearing. No matter what the media says to make you believe Trump obstructed justice, that fact that the acting FBI director said those accusation were false means there was no obstruction.
      </p>
      <p>
       So when Obama officials went in and got the transcripts of trump team calls you don't consider this spying? Trump put wiretap in quotations for a reason.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump's enemies in the government have been leaking secrets and classified info for close to a year now. It's reasonable to think that if they possessed real proof of trump colliding with Russia that they would have leaked it by now. Honestly your arguments are so flat. I can't believe I'm wasting my life arguing about this.

       Him firing the FBI director to stop him from investigating his ties to Russia is public knowledge. Trump even said so himself.
      </p>
      <p>
       The emoluments clause part is referring to the many business deals that have happened and profits he has had that coincide all to well with various statements and etc. Essentially this also brings up his unwillingness to put his businesses in a blind trust. This is, however, less clear cut than obstruction of justice.
      </p>
      <p>
       He has not been sentenced of anything yet, but these things take a long ass time. There is clear evidence and admission that James Comey was fired for investigating ties to Russia. That is obstruction of justice. This is known.

       Are you trying to claim that Trump never said that he fired the FBI director because of his Russia probe? That would be a very stupid claim to make considering how well documented his statements are.

      <p>
       Are you trying to claim that firing the FBI director to stop an investigation is not obstruction of justice? If so I would be very interested in your definition of obstruction of justice and why you have chosen one that does not align with the courts.

       It doesn't matter what Trump said. He has the power to fire the FBI director for any reason. He can also pardon anyone for any reason so do pardons count as obstruction? No. Trump didn't say he wanted to stop the Russia investigation, in fact Comey's memo claimed that Trump told him it would be good to know if any of his staff did collude. The investigation is still ongoing and the actin director told the senate that Comey's firing had not obstructed the investigation.

       For one, UN sanctions are pretty fucking powerful. I think the Pope has more clout. And any country with nukes is at least in the arena of the US President, albeit we have the biggest military toys. If China announced no further trade w us, our economy would collapse.

       People like you seem to think that our economic relationship with China is a one way street. They stand to lose as much as we do if our economic relationship failed. So while you think you're clever for pointing out "If China announced no further trade w us, our economy would collapse." I'll say, "if the US stopped trade with China, their economy would collapse". And we would advance the argument not at all.

       I die of laughter everytime I see this. The man that has essentially told the Special Counsel,
       <em>
        please don't look at my finances, look over there, but don't you dare look at my finances. That would be a red line
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, if you did a bit of searching outside of MSM bullshit shock jock reporting, you would have known about the financial fraud at Trump University, as well as the $10 fine his casino's received from FinCEN regarding money laundering violations. Those are very base level financial crimes. There are much more important ones regarding Trump Soho.

         Yes, Trump Jr, that meeting, is solid evidence of collusion, because he went there. But did he succeed in the meeting to Trump the presidency? No. Therefore your argument is weak. This is about real collusion that made Trump POTUS.

       You and I have different understandings of the Alfa Bank/ Trump Tower link. It was never used to conduct legitimate business. How do we know? There were only a handful of pings designed to hide the message being piggybacked on the signal. They happened within hours of trump making statements about new dirt to drop on Clinton and leaks being released. Those were the only times the servers talked to each other.
      </p>
      <p>
       So your 'reasonable fact' doesn't make any sense.
      </p>
      <p>
       Within hours of jr sending the email saying 'I love me some Clinton dirt' daddy big hands tweeted 'stay tuned big clinton dirt incoming'. As far as the law is concerned it doesn't matter if it's attempted collusion that results in a nothing burger or attempted collusion that results in a big Wikileaks dump.
      </p>
      <p>
       So it doesn't matter wether you think that's weak or not. The law doesn't really care what you think.
      </p>
      <p>
       But, none of this really matters. You're one of the people agent orange talks about when he says 'I can shoot a motherfucker and the morons who follow me won't give a fuck'. And I'm one of those people who likes to understand the law, reality, and wait for the multiple people investigating this narcissistic sociopath to present all the evidence they've gathered.

       If the Wall Street guys in Trump's administration helped cause the financial crisis then why didn't Obama's DOJ prosecute them? Maybe they gave enough to his presidential campaign to make a friend in the Oval Office.

       How does that make it better. An executive of Citibank who would later receive the largest bailout was Obamas advisor starting in 04 and then gave him a list of cabinet members and most of them ended up being chosen.

       No, you are not allowed to receive anything of value from a foreign agent, info is valuable. Trump crafted the lie, knew of the meeting and covered it up, that is all illegal. If this was all okay, they would not have lied multiple times about who was involved, what was discussed and if anything was exchanged.

       So not all legal experts, and Jr. has testified about this meeting so they are/were looking to charge him, they just have not done it yet. And if the info wasn't of value, why were they discussing "russian adoption" which is just code word for the magnitsky act, it makes it seem like they were giving them something back.

       For one, UN sanctions are pretty fucking powerful. I think the Pope has more clout. And any country with nukes is at least in the arena of the US President, albeit we have the biggest military toys. If China announced no further trade w us, our economy would collapse.

       I missed when it became public knowledge that he was found guilty of obstructing justice and emoluments.. If your opinion of him being "bad at the job" is reason for impeachment you need to step back into reality.

       They spied on Trump and his team for months, they have yet to put forward prof that Trump colluded with Putin and you still think they're going to find it? Come on man, if collusion happened they would have shown proof 9 months ago.

       Maybe they're just taking security very seriously(with damn good reasons). Kinda makes ya wonder why our President can't run as tight a ship.

       It doesn't matter what Trump said. He has the power to fire the FBI director for any reason. He can also pardon anyone for any reason so do pardons count as obstruction? No. Trump didn't say he wanted to stop the Russia investigation, in fact Comey's memo claimed that Trump told him it would be good to know if any of his staff did collude. The investigation is still ongoing and the actin director told the senate that Comey's firing had not obstructed the investigation.
