       I don't know much about cloud seeding or HAARP, maybe someone could explain those to me. Let's say that for whatever reason, TPTB want to stir up chaos with these ultra powerful hurricanes.
      </p>
      <p>
       How would they go about doing so? I don't know enough about hurricane formation to think of a theory.

       Can't speak on weather manipulation, but as a Floridian I can tell you that media manipulation during the hurricanes is very real. I went to Walmart today and it was empty, and I mean EMPTY..no water or food..all the gas stations are empty and there's no plywood anywhere. I'm not saying this storm is going to be bad, but after what I saw last year with Hurricane Mathew, I believe the fear mongering is very very real.

       wouldn't it be reasonable to say most Floridians have stored plywood in their garage for events like this?
      </p>

       Agree with you that the media blows this stuff up as if everything is an event that will kill everyone.

       Last year during Hurricane Mathew was by far the worst I've seen..they had made it seem like I'd be waking up in a post apocalyptic world when in reality the storm was weak weak weak.

       It is typical where I live too.  If they say 6 inches of snow, expect .5-1 with a rare drift that hits 6 inches.
      </p>
      <p>
       But to the question on plywood, wouldn't every house in Florida have shutters or plywood saved and ready for rapid mounting?

       Irma is the largest storm in the Atlantic in recorded history.. That must mean somthing. Btw, I was young and lived through Hurricane Andrew in 1992, it devastated West Palm beach.. My parents lost everything, then we moved to Colorado in 1993. Irma is Yuuuge!!

       That's not my concern, as much fun as that sounds the lack of watermarks and power may be knocked out for a month. Two nuclear power plants lay in the catastrophic path and storm surges over 20' will be problematic for the power station. This is the biggest and strongest storm ever recorded in the Atlantic, let that sink in real deep.

       I think this would've been a better thread if you researched cloud seeding and HAARP beforehand. That way you could actually give an opinion. This post is kind of a waste of space, and this topic is posted here probably 8-10 times a day.

       There are three forms, really that we (the public) know about. Cloud seeding in the air, land based mechanisms which pump water vapor up into the atmosphere, and then the use of HAARP to heat various areas up.

       I am not sure if this is related but I live in Central Florida. On my way to work at 930 PM in the clouds there is always rapid flashing. Same location EVERY NIGHT. Right by a factory on the water that has big smoke stacks but I honestly never see the smoke stacks making smoke. It could be explained as heat lightening but really seems odd it would be in the same exact spot every night.

       They have machines like big jet engines with afterburner that sit on top of bodies of water and point straight down and make clouds, this combined with the spraying of aluminium and barium salts make the atmosphere charged, which they can then "push" or steer clouds into existing cyclones or make new cyclones with radio frequency energy.

       [00062]  This invention has a phenomenal variety of possible ramifications and potential future developments. As alluded to earlier, missile or aircraft destruction, deflection, or confusion could result, particularly when relativistic particles are employed. Also, large regions of the atmosphere could be lifted to an unexpectedly high altitude so that missiles encounter unexpected and unplanned drag forces with resultant destruction or deflection of same. Weather modification is possible by, for example, altering upper atmosphere wind patterns or altering solar absorption patterns by constructing one or more plumes of atmospheric particles which will act as a lens or focusing device. Also as alluded to earlier, molecular modifications of the atmosphere can take place so that positive environmental effects can be achieved. Besides actually changing the molecular composition of an atmospheric region, a particular molecule or molecules can be chosen for increased presence. For example, ozone, nitrogen, etc. concentrations in the atmosphere could be artificially increased. Similarly, environmental enhancement could be achieved by causing the breakup of various chemical entities such as carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, nitrous oxides, and the like. Transportation of entities can also be realized when advantage is taken of the drag effects caused by regions of the atmosphere moving up along diverging field lines. Small micron sized particles can be then transported, and, under certain circumstances and with the availability of sufficient energy, larger particles or objects could be similarly affected. Particles with desired characteristics such as tackiness, reflectivity, absorptivity, etc., can be transported for specific purposes or effects. For example, a plume of tacky particles could be established to increase the drag on a missile or satellite passing therethrough. Even plumes of plasma having substantially less charged particle density than described above will produce drag effects on missiles which will affect a lightweight (dummy) missile in a manner substantially different than a heavy (live) missile and this affect can be used to distinguish between the two types of missiles. A moving plume could also serve as a means for supplying a space station or for focusing vast amount of sunlight on selected portions of the earth. Surveys of global scope could also be realized because the earth's natural magnetic field could be significantly altered in a controlled manner by plasma beta effects resulting in, for example, improved magnetotelluric surveys. Electromagnetic pulse defenses are also possible. The earth's magnetic field could be decreased or disrupted at appropriate altitudes to modify or eliminate the magnetic field in high Compton electron generation (e.g., from high altitude nuclear bursts) regions. High intensity, well controlled electrical fields can be provided in selected locations for various purposes. For example, the plasma sheath surrounding a missile or satellite could be used as a trigger for activating such a high intensity field to destroy the missile or satellite. Further, irregularities can be created in the ionosphere which will interfere with the normal operation of various types of radar, e.g., synthetic aperture radar. The present invention can also be used to create artificial belts of trapped particles which in turn can be studied to determine the stability of such parties. Still further, plumes in accordance with the present invention can be formed to simulate and/or perform the same functions as performed by the detonation of a "heave" type nuclear device without actually having to detonate such a device. Thus it can be seen that the ramifications are numerous, far-reaching, and exceedingly varied in usefulness.

       <br/>
       I claim:
1. A method for altering at least one region normally existing above the earth's surface with electromagnetic radiation using naturally-occurring and diverging magnetic field lines of the earth comprising transmitting first electromagnetic radiation at a frequency between 20 and 7200 kHz from the earth's surface, said transmitting being conducted essentially at the outset of transmission substantially parallel to and along at least one of said field lines, adjusting the frequency of said first radiation to a value which will excite electron cyclotron resonance at an initial elevation at least 50 km above the earth's surface, whereby in the region in which said electron cyclotron resonance takes place heating, further ionization, and movement of both charged and neutral particles is effected, said cyclotron resonance excitation of said region is continued until the electron concentration of said region reaches a value of at least 10.sup.6 per cubic centimeter and has an ion energy of at least 2 ev.
2. The method of claim 1 including the step of providing artificial particles in said at least one region which are excited by said electron cyclotron resonance.
3. The method of claim 2 wherein said artificial particles are provided by injecting same into said at least one region from an orbiting satellite.
4. The method of claim 1 wherein said threshold excitation of electron cyclotron resonance is about 1 watt per cubic centimeter and is sufficient to cause movement of a plasma region along said diverging magnetic field lines to an altitude higher than the altitude at which said excitation was initiated.
5. The method of claim 4 wherein said rising plasma region pulls with it a substantial portion of neutral particles of the atmosphere which exist in or near said plasma region.
6. The method of claim 1 wherein there is provided at least one separate source of second electromagnetic radiation, said second radiation having at least one frequency different from said first radiation, impinging said at least one second radiation on said region while said region is undergoing electron cyclotron resonance excitation caused by said first radiation.
7. The method of claim 6 wherein said second radiation has a frequency which is absorbed by said region.
8. The method of claim 6 wherein said region is plasma in the ionosphere and said second radiation excites plasma waves within said ionosphere.
9. The method of claim 8 wherein said electron concentration reaches a value of at least 10.sup.12 per cubic centimeter.
10. The method of claim 8 wherein said excitation of electron cyclotron resonance is initially carried out within the ionosphere and is continued for a time sufficient to allow said region to rise above said ionosphere.
11. The method of claim 1 wherein said excitation of electron cyclotron resonance is carried out above about 500 kilometers and for a time of from 0.1 to 1200 seconds such that multiple heating of said plasma region is achieved by means of stochastic heating in the magnetosphere.
12. The method of claim 1 wherein said first electromagnetic radiation is right hand circularly polarized in the northern hemisphere and left hand circularly polarized in the southern hemisphere.
13. The method of claim 1 wherein said electromagnetic radiation is generated at the site of a naturally-occurring hydrocarbon fuel source, said fuel source being located in at least one of northerly or southerly magnetic latitudes.
14. The method of claim 13 wherein said fuel source is natural gas and electricity for generating said electromagnetic radiation is obtained by burning said natural gas in at least one of magnetohydrodynamic, gas turbine, fuel cell, and EGD electric generators located at the site where said natural gas naturally occurs in the earth.
15. The method of claim 14 wherein said site of natural gas is within the magnetic latitudes that encompass Alaska
