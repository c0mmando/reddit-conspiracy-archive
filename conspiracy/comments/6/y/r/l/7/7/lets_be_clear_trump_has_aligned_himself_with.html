        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Hear me out before you down vote me. How did conspiracy become so pro-authoritatian? Why do we have so many article vehemently defending Trump? So many comments? When did people trust the government, the man controlling the levers of our economy, our courts, our justice system? Because Trump has cultivated an air of personality, a cult if you will, around him, and trolls or genuine people have fallen for it. Not to mention loads and loads of money and propaganda being fueled by domestic and foreign entities to keep us confused. And divided.</p>

<p>I can imagine why people here gave Trump the benefit of the doubt when he started his administration. But it has been EIGHT months since and what has changed? Just a few more immigrants harassed while entering the country? Poorer environmental laws? That&#39;s not the biggest thing on people&#39;s minds. That&#39;s not the biggest thing pushing back the <em>powers that be.</em> And yet here were are: Trump cozying up with New Yorkers, Democrats, bankers, and more. Is that what the people of the rust belt wanted?</p>

<p>The stocks are soaring, people yell. Who does it benefit? The 1%, the 0.1%? Definitely not the bottom 50% of people without a steady income let alone stocks. And look who Trump has been hanging out with? Remember all the stories about the pay-to-play on Trump&#39;s properties, the infinite golf trips. Was this really the anti-authoritarian, swamp draining President people voted for? How can the people of conspiracy who don&#39;t trust the government, see TPTB for what their machinations are, look at Trump&#39;s actions and support, even cheer them on? Why is there such as different voice here?</p>

<p>I think the answer is clear. Plain as day. Staring at us in our face. Let&#39;s not get divided by internal and external actors with hidden agendas and infinite money. Let&#39;s not stop to let our guard down at TPTB, even if he wears a red hat and has a seeming fan following. Let&#39;s not stop to be critical thinkers, just because a man insults a woman candidate repeatedly and has one-line <em>zingers.</em> TPTB are happy as long as the masses are entertained, don&#39;t forget. You judge a man by the company he keeps, by the actions he takes, not by the words he uses and the promises he makes.</p>

<p><strong><em>Edit: So far I&#39;ve had character attacks, insults, and just one or two genuine responses. And oh, 396 views (that&#39;s right!) and only 48% upvoted. If that doesn&#39;t tell you the whole story, nothing will!</em></strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s not what I meant, and you didn&#39;t read past my title before immediately down voting. I&#39;m sorry to see that. I said the sub seems much more pro-Trump than one might logically conclude it should be after EIGHT months of Trump&#39;s leadership for two primary reasons. I never said anything about a particular Trump supporter, including you. Do not construe this as a personal attack, I&#39;m talking about the sub as a whole. And I&#39;ll 100% condemn personal attacks as a way to unnecessarily divide us. Again, put yourself in the shoes of the people who conspiracy doesn&#39;t like and see how your behavior impacts their lives. That&#39;s a starting position.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This sub is not predominantly pro-Trump. It has been, from way long before the past election, very critical of the Clinton Cabal. Sadly, for the past year bringing up any of that group&#39;s many crimes and yes, <em>conspiracies,</em> labels anyone as being pro-Trump. </p>

<p>And of course there have been raids from Trump shills and bots since the election. Just as there were (and now back again, in force) from ShareBlue, CTR and others. Just as tehre are from flat-earth psyops, religious extremists, UFO wackos and others.</p>

<p>There&#39;s no consensus here, no single stance, no official opinion. And guess that&#39;s why many of us come here. If I wanted to hear nothing but a one-sided version of events and join the chorus for the 5 minute hate therapy sessions, I wouldn&#39;t leave twitter or facebook.</p>

<p>Furthermore, whenever anybody tries to untangle the weird political BS all over this sub anymore - it doesn&#39;t even work. I think it is because nobody trusts anybody else&#39;s motives anymore (are you a shill?) and, as stated above, the strangeness of Trump spawns even stranger revision to conspiracy history - like Clinton or Bush weren&#39;t so bad. That&#39;s a travesty.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Come on bro, this sub is beyond td2, it&#39;s td2 minus the obnoxiousness, with holocaust denial and ultra right wing conspiracies. It makes it extremely difficult to differentiate the ironic wave of Clinton related content being blasted in this sub every single time there is a headline update on the trump Russia investigation, though. I think that&#39;s why we are all frustrated.

    <div class="md"><p>A lot of Trump support comes from the fact that he is not a career politician. Every time he puts out a misspelled tweet it reminds people that he is a normal guy not surrounded by an army of PR and communication experts generating politically vacuous statements. What you call crowd pleasing soundbites for entertainment purposes other people interpret as a business man cutting the waffle and double speak. You might think &#39;build a wall&#39; is simplistic, but at the end of the day, defending a porous land border needs a wall. A politician would call it &#39;examining the potential physical infrastructure requirements with a view to strengthening the US legislative immigration response&#39;, but a business man calls it a wall. Because that&#39;s what it means. Would people feel better about Trump if he used more political gumph? Probably, because he would sound like other politicians. I would certainly like a job writing it because I could provide as many clever sounding, pointless big words as people felt they needed.</p>

<p>Which does bring us to his immigration policy. In that it isn&#39;t Trumps immigration policy. He is simply attempting to enforce the existing legislation. I have no idea which government generated it but Obama had eight years to change it and decided he was happy with it. If you don&#39;t like America&#39;s immigration policy blame the democrats.</p>

<p>In terms of Trump keeping promises, although I&#39;m not American, I wanted US forces out of Syria, and it looks like this is happening, training for rebel groups has wrapped up and with the media spotlight off Syria it looks like Assad will stay. I&#39;m not sure about the troops heading to Afghanistan at this point, but at least we won&#39;t have to worry about bringing democracy to Syria the same way we did with Iraq. This probably happened because of frank negotiations with Putin. Ending pointless wars involves talking to Russia. Obama should have done this, at least Trump has. </p>

<p>As to draining the swamp or otherwise, we can&#39;t tell what&#39;s going on from the outside so we don&#39;t know enough to accuse him of lying about it. I don&#39;t think anyone expected it to happen within eight months anyway. But whether or not this was an empty campaign promise, he is the best placed president in the last 40 years to even think about attempting it simply because he is not a career politician. According to my limited US political knowledge gleaned from reading Hunter S T books, politicians are compromised pretty quickly, and often inadvertently. Change can&#39;t come from an insider it has to come from someone outside the establishment. It gives people hope, even if some like yourself feel it is misplaced. Time will tell.</p>

<p>Sorry if I have rambled, I&#39;m simply an outsider who was pleasantly surprised to hear normal non political speech from a candidate- yes, even the pussy grabbing thing. I don&#39;t know what a trump presidency will deliver the American people and I hope you can all hang together somehow, but personally I wanted an end to the Middle East/Russia/US triangle and it looks possible for the first time.</p>

<p>You realize Obama was stonewalled by the GOP Congress. And now that they have control, they do .. what? Nothing. Which means, we all know who is really pulling the strings. You can&#39;t blame this on just the Democrats and get away with it.</p>

<p>Definitely! Change doesn&#39;t come from within, but where has he seemed to be from the outside? Who are his greatest friends in the WH right now? Bannon&#39;s out. Flynn&#39;s in deep shit. Reince is out. Who is in there? Generals? Goldman Sachs lifers? Who? </p>
