       It's my experience that some people are mere actors, willed on by their surroudings, following the script to the very end. They never thought for themselevs to start with and therefore can't be saved.

       The video that showed the Pentagon with a hole in it, but no marks where the wings would have hit and no debris did it for me. That they won't release the video taken from surrounding cameras only further re-enforces it.

       Sheeple like being sheeple. They put the blinders on and stick their fingers in their ears and yell "la la la la la" to block you out. They are living the dream. Nothing you say will convince them. Let them sleep.

       I disagree, sir. Unless something can provide evidence that it is so - and survive repeated attempts at disproving it - then it is not so. Thus, whilst people on self.conspiracy are free to call people such as myself "sheeple" for questioning many conspiracy theories, it does not actually make us sheeple. My concept of reality is right until proven wrong, and I am not convinced that that has been achieved yet.

       The holocaust is a state-sanctioned religious/mythical 'conspiracy theory'.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was alleged, among other things at the Nuremburg trials, that the Nazis had: made Jewish shrunken heads, made soap from Jewish fat, made lampshades from Jewish skin, and that there were extermination camnps in Germany proper. All now proven to be false. People, some probably innocent, were sent to their deaths based on false evidence and false testimony.
      </p>
      <p>
       The gas chamber shown for decades at Aushwitz was a Soviet fabrication, and for stating that truth in Austria, David Irving went to jail for over a year.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, it appears you are in favor people being sent to death based on false evidence in Soveit-style show trials. And you are in favor of people being jailed for making true statements.
      </p>
      <p>
       That sounds like the sort of thing a fucking Commie-loving totalitarian politically correct piece of shit would say. Burn the heretic!
      </p>
      <p>
       I hope you get tossed in prison for questioning the Holodomor  or burned at the stake for questioning some asinine religious orthodoxy one day. Perhaps then you will see the error of your ways.

       No, it's a documented, factual historical fact. Millions of Jews, Gypsies, Homosexuals, Mentally Ill Individuals and Political prisoners were executed methodically and brutally.

       But denying that the most horrendous act of genocide in modern history never happened is so outright shocking and sickening that jailtime is more than warranted. Those who do not learn from mistakes are doomed to repeat them, and we cannot afford to repeat the holocaust, no matter who would be on the receiving end that time.

       That isn't the same as the actual gas chamber being a fabrication. The fact of the matter is, millions of people were killed at that place. "How" doesn't really matter, at the end of the day.

      <p>
       Actually, all I am stating are facts - with a little editorializing at the end for good measure.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fact: The holocaust narrative describes a
       <strong>
        conspiracy
       </strong>
       by Hitler and the Nazis to exterminate the Jews.  And yet there is no evidence Hitler ever ordered the Jews to be gassed - making it a
       <strong>
        theory
       </strong>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Fact: it is
       <strong>
        state sanctioned
       </strong>
       . We have government-funded
       <strong>
        Holocaust Museums
       </strong>
       , holocaust education in government funded schools, we are still tracking down German camp guards 60 years after the war, and a dozen governments around the world make it punishable by law to challenge the scope of crimes against humanity as described and evaluated by the Nuremberg tribunal - which contained numerous falsehoods (shrunken heads, soap, lampshades, etc) with the
       <strong>
        truth being no defense
       </strong>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Fact: The Aushwitz gas chamber shown to the public
       <strong>
        is
       </strong>
       an admitted Soviet post-war
       <strong>
        fabrication
       </strong>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Fact: Stating the truth in no way denies the truth that the
       <strong>
        Nazis mass-murdered 10-20 million people
       </strong>
       . I have no idea why you would make such an absurd and
       <strong>
        crazy
       </strong>
       statement.
      </p>
      <p>
       Finally, since you seem unacquainted with the facts and make up ridiculous arguments, I don't really give a damn what you think.

       Exactly where is your fantasy of delusion and the racism extant in my post?  You cannot show it because there is none.  You cannot even deny the truth of my statements, because I can back everything I said with references. So you go to the old
       <strong>
        ad hominem attack
       </strong>
       again.
      </p>
      <p>
       How about some real racism and delusion?
      </p>
      <p>
       Claude Lanzmann, producer of the film Shoa, “Christ is false, and salvation will not come from him… Auschwitz is the refutation of Christ.”
      </p>
      <p>
       Chew on that. Sounds like a delusional madman touting a state-sponsored mythical pseudoreligion to me.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, until you can refute any of my factual statements - I deny your disgusting ad-hominem attack, and further assert that you are, in fact, projecting your own racism and delusion onto others.
      </p>
      <p>
       Finally, jailing people for their opinions is categorically wrong, totalitarian thought-crime nonsense - especially if it is only about one particular line of thought. That is racist.  The state has no business regulating opinions and free speech. To assert otherwise is to be a Commie/Nazi tyrant.

       What about the fact that the official story of 9/11 is indeed a conspiracy theory, just like anything posted here?
      </p>
      <p>
       The FBI admitted they don't have any evidence to link Osama Bin Laden to 9/11 (which is why it's not listed as one of his charges on their Most Wanted list)

       I start by quoting this witty thing I found on the internet: "Chritianity is the belief that a cosmic Jewish Zombie who was his own father can make you live forever if you symbolically eat his flesh and telepathically tell him you accept him as your master, so he can remove an evil force from your soul that is present in humanity because a rib-woman was convinced by a talking snake to eat from a magical tree."  It rarely succeeds.
