       I once would have considered myself atheist but I just can't now. It is too tied to this religion of liberalism.

       Just because Christians are against something doesn't make it worthy of defense.

       Just go on the atheism subreddit and suggest that pumping prepubescent children full of hormones is unwise. You will be banned within the hour. That is just one example of the dogma they now cling to.

       Leftists dont believe in Atheism, they are apart of "The Cult of Equality" which is the Religion of Modernity.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's basically a death cult.

       But now that you have no label for yourself, you should check out the writings of Julius Evola. His writing on spirituality and the occult might interest you.

       Ya atheism is just the opposite of a religious fanatic, both of them absolutely believe based on little /no definitive evidence. Most atheists when put on a spectrum are usually more agnostic I find... I mean unless you've been to the other side or had some personal miracle it's all speculation

       Atheism is not a lack of belief. Atheism is absolute belief that there is no God. I don't have my "god delusion" richard Dawkins book handy but he went into great detail about the full spectrum of non religiosity. Atheism is on the furthest possible end, if you think of it like a horse shoe atheism is on one end, absolute belief in a higher power on the other. Neither give any ground to anything in between.  But as with most horseshoe metaphors, the items on the far ends are actually alot closer together then they'd like to admit. That is how I interpret it anyways, but there certainly is a "belief" factor in absolute atheism. I've run the gamut from one end to the other, played on both teams. This is the way of it.

       The catholic denomination of Christianity has a lot of issues. It's corrupted and hijacked by luciferian illuminati who took high ranking positions like they do in all major institutions. That is why the priests that were accused were enabled and hidden. Not because priests are pesos. The percentage of catholic priests accused of molesting children is no greater than that of the normal population. It is the high ranking members of the organization that handled it very badly. They are also changing the rules of the Catholic Church so it less tied to the Bible. The Catholic Church has a lot of pagan practices and doesn't only follow the Bible. It worships Mary more than Jesus as well as Saints when the Bible says to only worship Jesus. The popes said in 1972 that the smoke of Satan entered the church. He was warning about the luciferians that infiltrated.

       Not for nothing, but the demographics of atheism lean very largely towards liberalism rather than conservatism.  Hence why the Democrats no longer tout God in their political message (for the most part), whereas Republicans cling to the word God like the holy grail of life votes.  If you can't consider yourself an atheist, then go love god, no one is forcing you into it.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you have decided you magically believe in god again because not beliving in god will make you a liberal, then we can pretend all of that is real and/or relevant also.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you continue your journey through rationalization in your brain, you will also find that religions, historically, have all been methods of control over people, moreso women than men.  So, I'm not sure why you're so surprised that an anti-religion subreddit is full of other liberal ideas.

       Well, I'm an atheist.  I just reject the atheism+ bullshit, or the notion that atheism is anything more than a binary position on one question.   The rest of the garbage that people tend to shovel into it is not related.

       The reason it became like this is about a decade ago it became a trendy counter-culture thing including on reddit to be atheist.
       <a href="/r/atheism">
        /r/atheism
       </a>
       was a very anti-theistic and hate filled place and they even banned image posts eventually because of all the memes.  Those same neckbeards have gotten older and are still here and they have gone with what they grew up hearing was the counter culture. . Socialism,  communism, and attached it to what they already prescribed to.
      </p>
      <p>
       They fail to see that it's the same side as much of the establishment and Noone who sides with these political parties is an actual counter culture ,  even antifa are just useful idiots and are hurting their own cause.... the only people convinced by their tantrums are the people who already agree with them or their basic ideology.
      </p>
      <p>
       Conservatives aren't a counter culture either in the bigger picture but on reddit they actually are,  some have pointed that out but most don't feel that way since they feel they are standing for the existing culture and older values.

       Evangelical internet atheists are mostly rebellious teenagers.  Instead of some fringe ideology they pour their energy into a misanthropic form of atheism that can justify all their antisocial angst and actions.  They wrap themselves in a flag of righteous rationality but all they have the brain power to do is spout canned rhetoric like any ideologue.

       Its because atheism is a kind of faith itself. A belief that there is no God/gods.

       I used to consider myself an atheist until this new wave of extreme liberalism and pro-Islam came. I'm like, they are REALLY trying to bring down Christianity aren't they? Not that Christianity doesn't have many faults, it certainly does. But all these people cheering for the death of Christianity, yet applauding and pushing for Islam and the normalization of the Islamic Religion, all those nods and references to Lucifer and Satan. Na ah. I've seen so many people try to claim that The Church Of Satan wasn't evil or bad. If it's not, then why the heck would you name it Church Of Satan when Satan is suppose to be this 'evil entity'? If you want to create an organization, religion, whatever, why name it THAT? People wishing for Illuminati to be real so they can 'sell their souls to the devil in exchange for fame and money'. I'm not saying God or Satan are real, but if Satan IS real, this is EXACTLY how he would create this 'false perception'. 'The greatest trick the Devil pulled was convincing the world he didn't exist'. This quote makes so much sense to me now. The Devil might be real he might be not. What's important is giving power to people that MIGHT believe he is real and are pushing for an agenda. And I'm sorry, but I'd rather stick to my somewhat Christian Orthodox views, always without being an extremists or take everything from The Bible literally, than become THAT.
