        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I am finding it quite difficult to find user uploaded video from people staying in FEMA facilities after hurricane Harvey.  Has anyone else seen any footage from inside these facilities that isn&#39;t shown on the television?  Kinda odd don&#39;t you think?  Especially when everyone has a smart phone these days.  Are they confiscating phones?  Are the cell networks down in the Houston area?  What gives?  I find the lack of organic journalism that usually accompanies catastrophic events a bit disturbing.  Who or what factors are preventing citizens from documenting their experiences?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I get what you are suggesting, but you would think there would be at least &quot;some&quot; footage.  All I can find is syndicated media clips.  No, not much back then either.  I think they be confiscating comm/tech devices.  Then the question begs: What are they covering up?  </p>

<p>Also, the thought just came to my mind that prisoners are not allowed comm/tech devices either.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As a Houstonian, I&#39;ve also heard of people forgetting their phones were in pockets or purses before wadding in water, thus destroying their only means of recording/sharing documentation.

    <div class="md"><p>That would certainly stand to reason.  But you would think at least &quot;some&quot; people had operable devices and filmed inside of these facilities.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t, although I know some people volunteering at the larger shelters - George R Brown and Toyota Center - and those just seemed like the command centers/main hubs for a lot of different organizations that you&#39;d expect during a massive natural disaster. I think any of the smaller local shelters are in suburbs or towns outside the central metro area.  Some of those areas were more affluent (thus less shelters, more staying with friends/at hotels) while other hard-hit areas are low-income and more diverse (thus more shelters but also possibly less access to &amp;/or utilization of digital devices and online posting).  Definitely a huge mix of people affected, either way.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting, thanks for your input and hope your faring well yourself.  Do you know anything about the authorities turning away public help in areas?  It was on a local news affiliate&#39;s report that I saw mention for the guard units blocking certain areas and preventing further water traffic?  Also, can you comment on the insect conditions?  Influx of flies and mosquitos?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can&#39;t really speak much to authority actions on still flooded areas since I&#39;m more centrally located.  There was a city wide curfew for awhile, apparently to curb looting (but it was fairly lenient here in town, unsure how heavily it was enforced in still affected areas), and military grade helicopters are a common sight now.  Only few &quot;turning away&quot; type situations I&#39;ve heard about sound more like organizations not having their shit together/being rude (Red Cross not using local clinic help, etc.) but I also personally know some local nonprofits who have been able to work alongside the big national/government players easily.  I&#39;ve only vaguely heard of still flooded areas being semi-restricted to only residents, but again as a looting deterrent supposedly.</p>

<p>Mosquitos though are definitely already an issue. And sadly a good number of Houston&#39;s bat colonies were destroyed due to the flooding, so the insect population is only going to get worse. </p>

<p>And thanks - we were some of the lucky ones, although we definitely pulled some anxious all-nighters watching the bayou near us rise. Survivors guilt is a real thing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Absolutely nothing on periscope.  That particular video is of an aid/Intel station, not a camp/shelter.  I flipped through several pages of Twitter video searches and can&#39;t find any footage either.  Just recycled videos we&#39;ve all seen the past week and some newer vids of gutted houses.  Hmm, makes me even more suspicious now!  Why or what is preventing videography from inside these facilities?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This will sound cliche as hell, but people video/stream figuratively everything from the awesome to the mundane.  There is someone or something keeping this from happening.  Maybe it&#39;s as innocuous as going through a metal detector at an airport or court house.  I&#39;m sure they are checking people as they come in for knives and other weapons.  That insinuates they are taking devices though to.  Why?  That would either mean valuables are confiscated to prevent altercations or they don&#39;t want attendees to communicate/document what is going on inside.  </p>

<p>This is the routine of posts that are on this subreddit now and it&#39;s annoying as hell to read.    </p>

<p>Fema is used for disasters, it&#39;s been proven that way    there&#39;s no anterior motive, don&#39;t believe everything you read.  There&#39;s real conspiracies but even proposing such a thing is absolutely insane.  </p>

<p>If I had a company or organisation that was used soley for disasters and such, I would make sure I have every possible item I need to help situations.  Instead of just using rational thinking that in case of such and such type even it would be good to have these select items in our inventory.  But instead people ran with fema camps, coffins, etc...   these are things that would be needed in case something happened..  </p>

<p>It&#39;s just frustrating to see such stupidity on here all the time now, it makes the interesting and possibly real conspiracies non effective and instead people focus on stupid shit like flat earth or fema death camps.   Just absolutely moronic.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t, although I know some people volunteering at the larger shelters - George R Brown and Toyota Center - and those just seemed like the command centers/main hubs for a lot of different organizations that you&#39;d expect during a massive natural disaster. I think any of the smaller local shelters are in suburbs or towns outside the central metro area.  Some of those areas were more affluent (thus less shelters, more staying with friends/at hotels) while other hard-hit areas are low-income and more diverse (thus more shelters but also possibly less access to &amp;/or utilization of digital devices and online posting).  Definitely a huge mix of people affected, either way.</p>
