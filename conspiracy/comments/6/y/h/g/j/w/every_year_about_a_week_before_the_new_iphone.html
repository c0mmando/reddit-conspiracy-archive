       I have no insider info or scientific basis but it seems odd to me that every September when a new iPhone is on the horizon my old iPhone starts experiencing weird lock-ups, re-starts, and poor general performance.
      </p>
      <p>
       It wouldn't surprise me if they are trying to nudge people towards an upgrade to the new model by releasing "updates" that create some of these foibles in people's older phone's before the shiny new one is unveiled.

       I think it's more likely that Apple isn't
       <em>
        deliberately
       </em>
       slowing down old phones, more that they're kind of indifferent to whether it does or not.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's a simple fact that the hardware on newer phones is generally more powerful than the hardware on older phones.  When a new update comes out, optimized for the newer hardware, it'll stop being optimized for the old hardware and run slower.  This isn't exactly a secret.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only reason I don't think Apple would deliberately (or, at least,
       <em>
        explicitly
       </em>
       and
       <em>
        purposefully
       </em>
       ) slow down older phones is the massive consumer liability it would open them up to.

       I'd like to see actual benchmarks run on these phones. I guess it might be too late at this point, but I don't put too much stock in anecdotes, especially if the phenomenon (or the perception that it exists) is widely known, as the searches would seem to indicate.

       what the hell did i just watch/read?
      </p>
      <p>
       besides the loose associations with car industry industry practices in the 1920s, the claim seems to be that new software updates slow down the phone in a harmful way
      </p>
      <p>
       If ten people with newly "slow" phones tried deleting all their apps and reinstalling (essentially what happens when you get a new phone) and still report severe impairment, I would be a lot more convinced than google search trends and concept definitions.

       My phone went to shit when they released a new OS not compatible with it, did what you stated and it was still shit. Takes multiple seconds for any UI action now, rotating the phone screen can take upwards of 10 seconds.

       It happens its why I stop updating the os once the phone gets to be older. The new os's are optimized to run on the new specs so it pointlessly works harder than before. Most people who use iphones will tell you to not bother updating your phone.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your phone is likely so old it cant get the updates. I was rocking a 4s before I recently swapped to an se. My son accidentally did the update and my phone became so slow it was ridiculous. It wasnt capable of running a facebook game and crashed the simplest of apps like messages or just browsing facebook.

       Thats your problem the 6 isnt ancient. The phones that will get hammered by this wave will be the 5 series. 6 is still there for a cheap alternative. They gotta have something to attempt to go against the cheap droid phones

       So here's my new theory- right before every release of a new iPhone android operatives start talking shit about Apple and the iPhone, tweaking google trends so "slow" and "performance" or something count the same. All this to boost cheaper android alternative sales. Put that in your pipe ...

       The update only effects previous generations... When they send out updates they have to modify them for each generation. One update for all generations would brick certain generations without modification.

       Apple doesn't offer more than a 2 year warranty for a reason. They know after that the failure rate is so high it's unprofitable.  I know. I worked there once upon a time doing tech support. Guarentee the call centre got slammed after a device has been out +1.5 years

       on another similar thread i got a response from an apple tech saying people were calling him up with no space left on phones wondering why they didn't work. This also seems to be hardware you are talking about.

       All I know for sure is that we CAN do better. Buy it for life needs to be valued in order for people to build lifetime items. As it is, it doesn't matter if your phone slows down, or seems to slow down, because you'll want the new features anyways. At least that's what they were banking on. I see alot of younger people rejecting cells phones altogether.  Not as many as I'd like though

       Nobody bothers to optimise software anymore, they just throw more hardware at the problem. The latest OS becomes cripplingly slow on older devices due to the ridiculous increase in hardware resource utilisation.
      </p>

       Modern software is a hilarious pile of abstractions that is ever growing, pissing more clock cycles away.

       My cell once formatted when I installed an update, after the update my WiFi stopped working, the thing slowed down and stuff just won't work like it used to. Eventually I am going to install linage OS and see if that helps but it spears to be software issues. I have an android, update fucked up once and did an update and factory reset when it wasn't supposed to, was like the 3 update ever.

       Something like this would be a good idea for a study, by a bunch of phones at the original firmware version test it out doing basic tasks then log the time it takes to accomplish. Then update and repeat. Seems like something that could have some interesting results.

       Should be the top post.  Dont update your phone... Especially if its a major update.  When you first purchase your phone the software &amp; hardware are designed to work together.  As the software advances your hardware stays the same.  Its like trying to run OSX on an Apple I.  I have an iphone 5 &amp; it runs perfectly because i have never updated it.  Learned this after having an iphone 4 i updated to the point they would no longer allow me to restore to factory settings.  All i need it to do is call/txt &amp; have an internet browser so i can reddit while i shit.

The fucking FBI alledgedly couldnt even access that iPhone they demanded Apple give them access to(this story is bullshit... Hi NSA!).

       Mmm OS releases that have been around longer have been around longer. Therefore there has been more elapsed time in order to find an exploit.

       This is why it's also ideal to keep an up to date version of Windows, if you use it.

       Your anecdotal evidence of never having been exploited is good for you, but doesn't prove anything here.

       If you are really concerned about security keep your phone in airplane mode when you are not using it - if you get hacked in airplane mode the US government is most likely responsible &amp; you are probably fucked regardless of what you do if you end up in that situation.

       I have done the same with a iPhone 5s It is running like new fast never freezes and I have another iPhone 5s same never updated but JAILBROKEN it runs the same fast great but has all the up todate things on it right up to ios 11 so why is it running so good because Apple never added whatever they do to slow it down . The I phone is a fantastic piece of equipment it could last for ever but that's no use . I even have a iPhone 3GS JAILBROKEN great phone . PLEASE NEVER UPDATE it's hard not to the way Apple pester you there is a way to stop updates but I don't think I am allowed to explain it on this page . SORRY B3rfc Great BRITIAN .

       So sad really.
      </p>
      <p>
       As an example of this on other platforms. .. the other day my nephew who works in the same building I do was nearby when I was using one of my machines , he commented on how "snappy" and "clean" it all was and I agreed and kind of ranted to him because that machine was a 486, 66mhz.  Obviously newer software is a lot cooler and does more but for the life of me I still can't understand how we are at 4+ghz and multiple cores etc and the machines do relatively little by comparison,  in fact in most cases you still need a video card with separate computing power to play games with any real fidelity ...
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not dissing the games, im dissing the OS more than anything.     I think the reason we are where we are with hardware was a huge planned obselesence push from the mid 90s through mid 2000s...

       Exactly.  I mean very few people outside as a curiosity compile their own Linux kernel anymore. .. back when I started it was like a nessecity, and the default kernel was just a placeholder and sucked... some of the light light Luiz distros are OK but there a also the thing where the processor is saddled with tasks that should be done by other processors but all the sound hardware etc is basically software driven, plus there is so much bloat to accommodate all kinds of ridiculous hardware and to constantly sense for it.

       This is why I still have iOS 9 on my 5S. My wife updated to iOS 10 on her 5S (after I told her not to multiple times) and her battery started acting up and lasting only about 1 hour on a single change.

       bloat ware. there is for sure weather it be intentional or not negative effects from loading new operating software on an older device. newer devices can run faster jump higher hit harder and the software that delivers the goods for that device will overexert your older device and drain battery life faster. you can put a big block V8 in a gocart but you might have some other real problems. im sure its not all unintentional tho after all the company is out to sell new products and if your smart phone worked great when it came out and lasted 5-10 years why would you ever bother to upgrade? planned obsolescence is a real and effect means to keep us consuming new products. if I sold a light bulb that never burned out how many times could I sell you a light bulb?

       <strong>
        Its called Planed Obsolescence
       </strong>
       and yes, its real.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its present especially in apple prducts, and I have witnessed the exact same phenomenon in older dell motherboards, specifically optiplex models.
      </p>
      <p>
       Apple has specifically stated in the past their phones and tablets are created for use for approximately 2-3 years before you "should get the new one". They consistently push the hardware envelope by allowing app designers to require much more than the current spec for their apps until they run like crap on your current hardware, then suddenly they refuse to update or download because you are using deprecated hardware / OS.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its all planned.

       Hm. iPhone sales peak righter after launch. About 2 years later, performance decreases because batteries have degraded, SSD performance has degraded, and developers have shoved more and more analytics tracking and poorly-optimized frameworks into their apps. Definitely evil corporate conspiracy, and not basic entropy.

       A common problem with conspiracy thought is accepting anecdotal and eye witness accounts and making logic leaps to inaccurate conclusions.

       Keep examining the evidence and the conclusions you make. Something like OPs claim can be tested and verified.

       I've had iPhones since the first and kept them all and I've only experienced slow down once the OS outgrew the hardware. Such as the iPhone 5 I have being a bit slower with the most modern OS than it was with the OS that came gavotte installed. That's how computers work. However, if you're having all these alleged troubles on a routine basis perhaps the common denominator is you or perhaps the ghost of Steve Jobs is going fruitarian up in phones and shit.

       The secret is to never update your phone after you buy it. Turn off Bluetooth &amp; keep it off, don't put your personal shit on iCloud like a dumbass, and you'll be fine.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or just don't get an iPhone in the first place.
      </p>
      <p>
       I had an iPhone until I moved out after college. Made the switch &amp; never looked back. It sucks for the first week because you're leaving behind your entire ecosystem, which means you have to reinstall (and/or pay for) every single app all over again, but you won't be sorry you did it.

       It's not just the iOS updates either. Most apps require updates all the time and I wouldn't be surprised if they have planned obsolescence also. Eg. Facebook has a 64mb update? When was the last time you updated the website version? I've had PS4 games with smaller updates that changes things significantly.
Pinterest has updates every week.
At some point you'll run out of room.
They all still run fine without updating, at least for one, maybe two more generations.

       Apple has pulled every shady trick in the book. They don't pay taxes by keeping billions offshore (more than any other corporation), they intercept all your texts with imessage so that if you try to switch to a non-Apple phone, you won't get your texts and be forced to return to Apple. They keep your contacts hostage. They design devices that will shatter from routine knocks and drops. And yeah, they slow down phones right around the time the new one comes out, on purpose, no doubt. It's practically part of their business model.

       But what is the mechanism for the "slow down?" People start searching "why is my phone slow..." before the new phone is released and before the new OS gets released. So nothing has changed on their phone, but it has started to "slow down." Personally, I just think it is people who want a new phone and want to justify it by saying something is wrong with their current phone.

       So this is what gets me. You know how after you restart your phone, you have to enter your full lock code, even if you have Touch ID enabled?
      </p>
      <p>
       Sometimes when I wake up, I have to do this. And it's not a pattern (e.g. Every 2 days or something).
