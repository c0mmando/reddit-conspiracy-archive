        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;m not saying I agree or disagree with either thing, I&#39;m just questioning why would the government do these two things.  I&#39;ve heard debate about how many people were in the trade center towers, but I&#39;m pretty comfortable believing around 3,000 people died that day. Among them 343 firefighters and 80+ cops (I don&#39;t know the exact number on that one).</p>

<p>So why would they do that to start a war, and then fake Sandy Hook, ostensibly to pass gun control laws they never passed (NY passed some, but none nationally that I&#39;m aware of)?  As reprehensible as it is, if you&#39;re willing to fly those planes into the towers on the morning news, and they collapse however they collapse, but that was part of the plan, then certainly you&#39;d probably assign somebody to shooting up a school for real.  Did they grow a conscience in between?  I can&#39;t reconcile why they would do one and fake the other.  </p>

<p>Also, a lot of people believe the Boston Marathon bombing was fake, same question. Why would they fake that after doing.9/11 and what did it accomplish? (I have a colleague who ran that Marathon and had family members hurt, he assured me it was real). I haven&#39;t seen any real escalation in the war on terror since then.  Trump wants to let less Muslims in but it&#39;s unclear to me.if that happened (and travel ban are nothing new). And fireworks and pressure cooker are still readily available.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not trashing anybody, I just don&#39;t understand why you would believe both of these things, because why would they do that?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Seeing the two tallest buildings collapse to dust, live, on TV certainly gets every one&#39;s attention - which was the idea. With Sandy Hook there were no bodies, no blood and only a lot of people running around. Also with Sandy Hook, you had the Police saying, blatantly, that the version of the events told by the Officials is the &quot;only&quot; truth and that any other truth would be punished. The Boston Marathon had a huge amount of Police looking for <em>one guy</em>. I knew someone who was actually in that race and she emphatically stands by the &quot;Official&quot; story. So, why? People are in their own little world. They are scared of the world. They will not accept that the one institution that should protect them is lying to them. They can&#39;t handle that.</p>

<p>No, I am saying that, like 9/11, innocent people were hurt and/or killed to further a political agenda. I, personally, find this deplorable and despicable. This demonstrates that there are truly evil people in this world who, unfortunately, are in places of power over the general population and clearly are ready to commit heinous crimes to get what they want.</p>

<p>Regarding the Boston Marathon, the local government decides to invoke, temporarily, Martial Law and use thousands of Police to hunt down one scared and lonely teen-ager? Either the local Police are incredibly incompetent and inept or there was a dual agenda happening. In addition, the FBI has been caught - red handed - repeatedly conning some poor smuck into doing some terrorist thing and then miraculously &quot;catching&quot; him. Either way, yes, the US government is evil and uses deception <em>with disregard for human life</em> to further their political goals.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just going to point out he isn&#39;t necessarily saying that. A lot of times the story goes that within the big government, inside the FBI, CIA, and other agencies there is a ton of compartmentalization. So only a few at the top need to be truly informed of the plan. I think wrapping my head around that fact helped me a lot to understand how these kind of things could happen. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re just full of strawmen, aren&#39;t you? You might want to look into the utility of incrementalism. The number of those who would fight for their right to keep their weapons goes down with every such psy-op while the number of those who choose to give them up voluntarily goes up every time. A few more of these and the only ones left who bear arms are hunters and easily vilified fanatics. That was the plan from the start, and that is the plan still. Obama was just a face to blame for it all. Those who scheme for this goal are still in power all the same. That is the nature of a shadow government.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not going to dox him so somebody else can ask him, and I&#39;m not going to ask him for before and after pics of his relatives.</p>

<p>You can choose to believe me, or not. Like anything else on the internet.  But I&#39;ve no reason to lie to you. I&#39;ve said from the outset (in other threads if not this one) I&#39;m a skeptic, but I&#39;ve tried very hard not to be rude or trash anybody else&#39;s beliefs. But I want to hear all the points of view.  Since I had to create a new account (which is a story I&#39;ll explain if you like), my post history is probably mostly I&#39;m this sub, but I think if you read it, it probably looks like a skeptic, not some shill.  People come here because they question what they&#39;re told. Right on.  I come here and question what I&#39;m told here.</p>

<p>To believe that 9/11 was real and these other things are fake seems odd to me.  If you believe it&#39;s all orchastrated, but real, I understand.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wait. What? Is your title question correct?</p>

<p>I&#39;m confused, I think. Do you mean to ask why do people believe the official narrative of 9/11 and believe that Sandy Hook was faked?</p>

<p>Your final question and body statements make that question confusing to me.</p>

<p>If I have your question correct, I&#39;m not sure I&#39;ve yet to encounter anyone who believe the official narrative of 9/11, yet think sandy hook was faked.</p>

<p>In my experience online, I&#39;ve encountered people who think 9/11 truthers are nuts. But it gets a lot more angry/confrontational when you suggest that Sandy Hook could be a fake event.</p>

<p>As far as real life goes, hell, I&#39;d be surprised if 1 in 10 people even know about Sandy Hook.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m asking if people simultaneously believe that the government was behind 9/11, where there was undoubtedly a great loss of life, yet that Sandy Hook was a hoax.  At a glance, it looks like there are  people that believe both of these. If so, I&#39;m wondering why they believe the government would kill 3,000 people at 9/11, but then grow a conscience and stage Sandy Hook.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s actually a fair bit of uncertainty and debate surrounding the number of casualties in the demolition of the wtc. There&#39;s at least some indication that it wasn&#39;t 3000 people, and that the building was mostly empty by the time of the attack. Certainly many perished during the attack and certainly many died from ill health in the years after though. All in all, the death toll that accrued over the years as a result of the attack numbers in the hundred thousands, though, especially throughout the Middle East.</p>

<p>Also, I wouldn&#39;t say it is evidence of a conscience, that they would choose not to murder innocent children when they can just as well fake it all. I just think faking it is the superior option if your gonna do anything as insane as that. I think the two events serve very different purposes and therefore warrant very different approaches. Why do you think that there&#39;s a conflict between the events?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They could have started a war on shoddier evidence had they wanted to.  So if you think the government is behind 9/11 and they were willing to put on a pretty grand spectacle.  If you want gun control and you&#39;re willing to go to such lengths to achieve your agenda, why have &quot;crisis actors&quot;?</p>

<p>The truth is that when anything happens, the internet is so quickly poluted with theories and pictures that are sometimes erroneous, even if put there with the best intentions, that it becomes very difficult to separate the wheat from the chaff.  There seem to be people who believe every incident or disaster is a hoax or some sort of false flag.  I don&#39;t think that&#39;s realistic.  Some things I believe are mostly what they appear to be.  Elsewhere in this thread I said I know somebody who had relatives lose limbs in the Boston bombing.  Another person here cleearly doesn&#39;t believe the bombing was real.  I believe my colleague.  He has no reason to lie to me.  Do I have proof? No.  If I got before and after pictures of his relatives, somebody could say &quot;they could have got those injuries anywhere&quot;.  If I had pictures of them injured in Boston, some people would claim it was photoshopped, because their minds are just made up.</p>

<p>The best answer I&#39;ve heard in here is that there are separate shadowy entities that handle things different ways.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s food for thought about everything conspiracy theories. It&#39;s not an original thought, but I can&#39;t remember where I originally heard it.  Conspiracy theories tend to crop up around situations where something tragic happens as the world watches, and part of us just doesn&#39;t want to believe our world is that fragile.  We don&#39;t want to believe that a guy in a book depository can kill the president with a $12 surplus Italian rifle.  Was there more to it? I don&#39;t know. I was born almost a decade later.  There&#39;s plenty of sketchy shit surrounding it.  But there&#39;s fifty years worth of theories and claims, and then the internet comes along and all of that explodes. I can&#39;t tell what the truth is to my satisfaction.</p>

<p>EVERYTHING isn&#39;t a hoax, false flag, staged crisis, or whatever label you want to put on it. Also, some of them just don&#39;t  make sense.  It seems that in general, very few of us really change our minds once we&#39;ve drawn our conclusions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>at least some of the victims of 9/11 were fake, particularly the airline passengers. i say this because i found a list of passengers names, and randomly googled several of them, and these people did not exist outside of 9/11 </p>

<p>also, many people believe that something other than a Boeing 757 filled with passengers crashed into the pentagon on 9/11 </p>

<p>If this is the evidence to support your theory, I&#39;m afraid it&#39;s based on poor logic. Of <em>course</em> you&#39;re not going to find much by Googling ordinary people who died nearly two decades ago. Most people didn&#39;t have an online footprint 16 or 17 years ago, and in many cases what little online footprint people may have had back then would be long, long gone by now. Based on your logic, literally <em>billions</em> of people never actually existed, since you won&#39;t find anything on them with a random Google.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>the burden of proof lies with those making the allegation, </p>

<p>so in the case of 9/11, where is the proof that people were murdered on a Boeing 757 that supposedly crashed into the Pentagon?</p>

<p>if you were the prosecutor, what evidence would you present to convince a jury that a suspect is guilty of the allegations?</p>

<p>can you even name a specific suspect in the Pentagon attack aspect of the 9/11 coincidence?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have trouble believing that a controlled event of that type and impact would result in little more than public horror and renewed debates about firearms and mental health. Even in the extreme scenario of real deaths carried out by an agent of some kind...in a macro sense, there simply wasn&#39;t an objective achieved or even seriously considered, really, just a conspiracy-inclined motive and <em>potential</em> consequence. Unless you view it as part of a sequence or something. But I haven&#39;t researched it very much TBH beyond the usual Alex Jones screeching.</p>
