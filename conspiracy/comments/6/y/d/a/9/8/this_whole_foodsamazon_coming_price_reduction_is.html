       WF has jacked their prices up enough that people in line are noticing, and over the last three weeks, I've noticed a doubling of price on a couple things I buy regularly. My bill there is about 30 to 40% higher now than last month, buying roughly the same things.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is classic pre-sale price gouging. Once they get the EBT/WIC contracts, they'll drop the prices on "common" foods back down to what they were a month ago and keep other shit jacked-up â€“ and call that a price reduction.

       I use to work at a grocery store and they'd have a monthly farmers market. The "farmers" would come into the store to buy produce and resell them for a higher price whenever they would run out.

       You should really avoid corn and soy which is 90% GMO but you should also get to know your "local" sellers to see if what you're getting is really good.

       For the most part if you buy local goods from the farmer's market that's only run on the weekend, you're good on Saturday.

       Amazon is in it for the long-term, is the thing. They're like WalMart in that they'll intentionally bleed a bit in the short-term knowing that it kills their competitors and lead to market domination in the long-term.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whole Foods is absurdly costly, though, but now that Amazon's bought it I'd put money that they'll ensure cost competitiveness relative to local markets.
      </p>
      <p>
       What Amazon's ultimately going to do, though, is grocery delivery. Might be costly now but again, long-term they're going to dominate the drone industry and self-driving cars. This will get to the point that delivery will become the norm and they'll have first mover advantage.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's also not forget that Amazon is going to make a killing selling our data, which now includes online Prime purchases
       <em>
        and
       </em>
       food purchases. With Alexa and Echo Look, they'll be able to combine this data with what is said and visually recorded inside the household.
      </p>
      <p>
       Amazon knows what they're doing. Acquiring Whole Foods might seem like a bad decision but when extrapolated to their larger goals, it's brilliantly terrifying.

       <p>
        What Amazon's ultimately going to do is grocery delivery.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Grocery delivery has been a thing here for years and its had very little uptake.  I only see one house on my block that has the delivery bins, and they're a childless couple in their late 50s or early 60s, so their buying habits may be niche.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think the reasons against it being successful in a lot of areas are:
      </p>
      <p>
       1) There are a lot of grocery stores, which means there's at least one that's pretty close to most people.  Travel time is negligible.
      </p>
      <p>
       2) Meats and produce selection is meaningful.  I pick through all my produce and meat cuts to pick out the best available and there's a wide range.  I can't see an underpaid picker spending that kind of time or caring very much about what gets selected for me, meaning you end up with average or worse quality.
      </p>
      <p>
       3) I shop for food on two time horizons -- what I need for the next week and what I need in the next 2-3 hours.  The former means I have a lot of flexibility when I shop, the latter means my needs are nearly instant.  The benefit of delivery within these parameters seems pretty low.
      </p>
      <p>
       4) I am a compulsive list shopper -- I have a custom made shopping list form I fill out before I shop, laid out to align with the store layout.  But despite this, 10-20% of my purchases are improvisations or impulse purchases.  I buy something other than what's on my list (tweak a recipe, change a meal plan, etc).  I see grocery delivery ultimately causing me to make more small trips to the store or causing a vague dissatisfaction with what I have because I'm missing those impulse buys.
      </p>
      <p>
       5) Delivery of perishables, especially frozen, seems to imply needing to schedule being home close to the delivery time to prevent melting or spoiling.   My gut reaction was that this would be useful in urban areas to people without cars, but then where to the deliveries get left?  You'd literally have to be home to prevent theft or not have anyplace the bins could be left.  This seems to be more scheduling disruptive than an hour trip to the market for a week's groceries.

       I respect your view and you raise good points, but I'm the opposite type of consumer in that I prefer online to brick and mortar. I also admit to ordering groceries off Amazon Prime Now frequently when in the US--at present, they only sell mostly packaged goods, but in other markets I know they did produce and items from Sprouts (soon to be WF, no doubt).
      </p>
      <p>
       I'll also say it's very easy to do impulse purchases on Prime Now. They have "other customers also selected" feature which showcases snacks I may not have thought to buy. So, number 4 on your list can still work with online shopping. It's also so much easier to scroll through offerings than it is to browse aisles so I'm more likely to pick up stuff I don't need. It's just easy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also worth noting that the majority of household purchases are made by women.
       <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/bridgetbrennan/2015/01/21/top-10-things-everyone-should-know-about-women-consumers/#483e24126a8b">
        Forbes
       </a>
       estimates 70-80%, actually. This demographic is going to find online grocery shopping incredibly appealing because (assuming they're also the primary caregiver, which again statistically is a fair one to make), it can be a huge pain to take young kids, newborns, etc, to the store. It's an ordeal unto itself between the car seats, temper tantrums, unloading the damn car, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Online grocery shopping's main impediment, as I see it, is price. I've seen some outlets that are exorbitant, but Amazon's quest for global domination means they of all corporations can make it cost effective.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, I don't want this to sound like an Amazon infomercial because I view them with the same disdain as WalMart. In fact, I'm going to make a concerted effort to buy from farmers markets even  though I personally find it less convenient.

       I wouldn't give a f*ck about how brilliant the scheme is or how convenient it is. The shit that Amazon pulls is definitely helping the decline of society. If we want to believe we are in any control then we should start exercising our rights to avoid a product or provider.

       Concepts are not mutually exclusive. I agree with you--Amazon as a corporation is leading the decline of society. I specifically stated I'm going to make a concerted effort to move away from Amazon for this reason.
      </p>
      <p>
       But all of this doesn't negate the fact that Amazon is making good business decisions that appeal to consumers who are price sensitive and looking for convenience above all. Don't shoot the messenger here.

       I just gave up my Prime membership for this reason, and also because the quality of Amazon Prime is not what it used to be. Most packages I ordered last year did not arrive in 2 business days. Many of them were delayed, and I got someone else's package once instead of my own.

        Meats and produce selection is meaningful. I pick through all my produce and meat cuts to pick out the best available and there's a wide range. I can't see an underpaid picker spending that kind of time or caring very much about what gets selected for me, meaning you end up with average or worse quality.

       This is the biggest reason online grocery delivery has never interested me.  At any given time, at least a quarter of what's available in produce is too old, picked too soon, or otherwise unacceptable.

       And who wants their groceries sitting out by your front door where they could be stolen or poisoned?

       So, this is actually pretty short-sighted.
      </p>
      <p>
       A lot of the reason the produce is old/picked over/unacceptable is because people like
       <a href="/u/OperationMobocracy">
        /u/OperationMobocracy
       </a>
       is picking through food.  A second reason is because the food needs to be out for display.
      </p>
      <p>
       If food just goes straight to delivery, the timing and quality can be controlled much more tightly.  You might end up with better produce overall than picking it out yourself at the store.

       You make it sound like I'm actually damaging the food when I'm choosing which produce or meats to buy.  Ridiculous.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most of the time I just visually inspect what's in the bin and skip over the bruised or bad produce and I only really touch what goes into the cart.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some produce I do touch -- I want avacados that are ripe enough to eat today, not their rock-hard lookalikes that need another week of ripening, I want tomatoes that are firm, and not overly soft, and so on.  I don't mishandle them and I don't think anything I do detracts from their salability to someone else.
      </p>
      <p>
       Meats you'd have to really try to damage -- it's already packaged in some way, often vacuum sealed.  Picking through the bin for specific weight targets or marbling patterns doesn't damage the meats at all.

       I didn't accuse you of damaging the food, but when you have (a) lots of handling some damage always occurs and (b) when people systematically only take the best of the best, the rest gets old and stale and accumulates damage, meanwhile it stays out on the shelf because nobody wants it.

       Not only that but it's fun to go to the grocery store. With more brick and mortar stores closing down because of fierce online competition, I think it will be important to keep the physical stores. I am against society eventually running entirely on a network, including simply performing daily errands.

       I understand why amazon did it but I think you misunderstood my comment. It's not good for me or you or your local health food store. I don't give a fuck if it's good for amazon or keeps WFM from a hostile takeover. It's not good for the consumer unless they like vast vertical monopolies and giving their money to one of the richest guys on the planet. It's certainly not good for the employee. I worked at WFM for 3 years and quit recently, a major reason being that I don't want my labor owned by jeff bezos.

       enormous companies merging into even larger companies and think that's a good thing, you fall into one of the two camps I mentioned in my first comment.

       I never said it was good for anyone, except Amazon's business model and bottom line (all while reiterating that this is not the same thing as being good for society). I said it was cheap. Convenient.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, I think we're both missing each others' points at this juncture, but I respect your views. I agree with your attitude and I wish more consumers would boycott Amazon altogether.

       I'm gonna play devil's advocate and claim they'll drive prices lower to, at the very least, match Trader Joe's. They'll slowly cannibalize what made WF good in the first place until it becomes a yuppie's WalMart--this is what we see for their "New and Interesting Finds on Amazon:" cheap but stylish crap. By the time this happens, people will be used to groceries showing up at their door and other businesses will struggle to catch up. Amazon's model has always been about price competitiveness, convenience, and delivery... and I see them extending that to their acquisition of WF.

       I'm in the agricultural business.. Whole Foods sources their shit from a common distributor/dealer, same as everyone else (Kroger, Walmart, Publix.. etc) In most case, even if they don't source from the same dealer it all comes from the same "big" farms anyways.
      </p>
      <p>
       For instance, in Atlanta area, near all the grocers got their organic carrot from Castillini (packaging house) or Fresh Point/Sysco (dist./packer). The dealers source organic carrot from Grimmway Farms.
      </p>
      <p>
       Many of the organic growers, much like their non-organic GMO infested crops counterparts, are big corporations masquerading as "small" or "family farms." Like the one above, Grimmway Farms is a HUGE corporation specialized in growing only carrot, or Taylor Farms is also another big one, growing all kind of greens, organic or not.
      </p>
      <p>
       You better off saving your money and shop at the local Wally World, chances are whatever produce you're looking at, organic or not, comes from the same packaging house, or the same farm.

       We didn't have a WF, but a Wild Oats in town. Walmart sold the same products for nearly half the price. Including Wild Oats brand!

       That means those products are discontinued and/or the manufacturer is changing labels/recipes/sizes and they need all of the old item out of the store.

       Yes, if I had more forethought, I would have been been taking pix of items in the store, saving my receipts for comparison, etc., etc., but alas, I often have to procure food for the family on my lunch hour or in-between other shit and don't take the time.

       I really don't know where to buy food anymore.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even Trader Joe's and Costco's food is produced by Conagra, which was named named one of the 'Top 100 Corporate Criminals of the 1990s' by a corporate watchdog organization, Multinational Monitor.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        In 2002, Conagra and other major food and beverage companies including PepsiCo, General Mills, Kelloggs, Sara Lee, and H. J. Heinz Co.
        <strong>
         spent millions to defeat Oregon Ballot Measure 27, which would have required food companies to label products that contain genetically modified ingredients
        </strong>
        .[25] According to the Oregon Secretary of State, ConAgra contributed $71,000 to the campaign to defeat the state ballot initiative.[26]
Throughout 2012, ConAgra contributed $1,176,700 to a $46 million political campaign known as the Coalition Against the Costly Food Labeling Proposition, sponsored by food producers.[27] The organization's goal was to
        <strong>
         oppose the California citizen's initiative, known as Proposition 37, demanding mandatory labeling of foods containing genetically modified ingredients.
        </strong>
       </p>
       <p>
        In 1997, Conagra pleaded guilty to federal criminal charges that its Peavey Grain unit
        <strong>
         illegally sprayed water on stored grain to increase its weight and value and also bribed federal inspectors.
        </strong>
        The company agreed to pay $8.3 million to resolve the charges, which included a $4.4 million criminal fine, $3.45 million as compensation for illegal profits and $450,000 to reimburse the U.S. Department of Agriculture for storage and investigation expenses. Conagra had also paid $2 million to settle a related civil case filed by a group of Indiana farmers.[22]

       I'm using a tiered approach.
      </p>
      <p>
       1) Grow it myself.  Harder than it might seem.  Having some success, but not much.
      </p>
      <p>
       2) Then hit up local farms at the local weekend farmers' market.  (There are open-all-week "farmers markets" but you can tell the food ain't local).
      </p>
      <p>
       3) THEN hit up the local grocery store for anything that's missing.
      </p>
      <p>
       We plan meals for a week and buy everything once.  Budget ends up being around 50-70$/week for 2 people.

       I would have loved to have shopped at Whole Foods at one time. Sigh, it is too roch for my blood. Having it be bought out by Amazon is like McDonalds buying Panera. The products WILL go to shit, folks, regardless of timely drone delivery.
