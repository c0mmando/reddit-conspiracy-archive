<p>No they actually really couldn&#39;t because Trump has enough popularity to kick start a revolution that will most certainly send the pitchforks and tar their way.  Guaranteed.</p>

<p>They&#39;re not mutually exclusive concepts cupcake.  The Deep State is group of unelected bureaucrats from intelligence agencies, industry wogs and think tanks and media, Trump is not and has never been a part of these people.  There is a civil war going on within the intelligence agencies between both factions just like at the top with the Elite.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s what is so hilariously transparent about the ShareBlue propaganda. The progression is always something like this:  </p>

<ol>
<li><p>It doesn&#39;t matter which side you pick because they are both controlled by the evil establishment.  </p></li>
<li><p>Even if it looks like Trump is trying to fight the evil establishment, it&#39;s all an act and he&#39;s actually part of the grand NWO plan. Somehow he is also really stupid. Or evil. Maybe both. Doesn&#39;t matter because...  </p></li>
<li><p>Actually it does sort of matter which side side you pick because even though the Democrats are also controlled by the establishment, at least they aren&#39;t as bad as Republicans! Net neutrality! Healthcare! Political buzzwords make me feel better! Here&#39;s a WaPo article to back me up.  </p></li>
<li><p>And besides, Hillary wouldn&#39;t have been that bad anyway.  </p></li>
</ol>

<p>Okay, so ShareBlue seems to have abandoned the 4th one here because it is too obvious, but it was only a few weeks ago that they tried it. People started to see upvoted comments defending WaPo and Hillary Clinton and it became very clear to the actual <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> users where the manipulation was coming from, if it wasn&#39;t already.  </p>

<p>These stupid fucking shill farms could have flown under the radar a little bit if they weren&#39;t so desperate to divide the community over supporting President Trump. I can think of several very interesting reasons why ShareBlue would be so desperate to keep us from supporting the first conspiracy theorist president. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t exactly understand what you think needs to be &quot;backed up&quot;.</p>

<p>The &quot;narrative&quot;, as you call it, is a non-partisan universal truth:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There are thousands of men and women in this country who have seen war and death and don’t want any more to do with it. They want to live in peace. They want to forget the things they’ve had to do in the service of their country. They want to raise their kids and have family BBQs and build tree houses and soap box derby cars and have tea parties.</p>

<p>They don’t want this crap that you’re selling. You have the extremist left and the extremist right that are doing their best to get something started. To force us into a Civil War.</p>

<p>People want evidence that counter protesters were paid in Charlottesville, as the post clearly implied. Not that there are paid crowds. </p>

<p>There are paid crowds- it&#39;s a fact.  There were counter protesters in Charlottesville-  that is also a fact. That does not mean that the counter protesters were paid. Just because X is true, and Y is true, does not mean that X=Y. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well I have personally seen the advertisements on Craigslist here in New York City as I have been unemployed for the past few months. Now obviously an ad on Craigslist doesn&#39;t prove anything I never called them so who knows they could have been fake but I have seen multiple ads over the last 8 months in New York City Craigslist. I may not have any concrete proof in my hands but taking a look at history and how it repeats itself and looking at the current climate and things that I witnessed with my own eyes I think it&#39;s fair to say that this stuff is going on but that&#39;s for each person to decide on their own.  I can understand if people need to see more proof and I can also understand if other people assume it is in fact happening based on logic and the circumstantial evidence we do have not to mention motive, and there&#39;s been legitimate agent provocateurs spotted at recent protests, plenty of evidence for one to make up their mind imo.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>its not that people dont believe, we just need proof.  posting an ad on craigslist or 4chan can be anyone.  we shouldnt just be circulating shit for the hell of it, post it so we can discuss if its true and how we can obtain evidence of such, dont just post it and go &quot;look what i found!&quot; because there is no proofs.  thats what you need to keep in mind is that people arent disagreeing because they are against you, they just know we cant fall into a cycle of posting b.s. and everyone here kust taking it as truth.  tjats the biggest problem across the land is that people just accept what is told to them instead of asking questions.  dont feel defensive when people bring shit up, try to answer it and if you cant try to find something/someone who can.  sick of people looking at an argument as a battle to win instead of a chance to qualify or disqualify an idea/information.  be ready to change your mind, its ok to be wrong.</p>

While they may have sources they protect there is a name at the top of the paper that says who wrote the article and who edited it.

    <div class="md"><p>Hmmm for these sorts of topics is it tho? Seems anyone with the power and position can claim anything as real/fake evidence and the mass will believe it without a 2nd thought. Thats why I say evidence isn&#39;t as important as to who was involved, what message was spread and what is being pushed for after the event. That&#39;s the evidence i need, anything else is sort of a bonus after. I&#39;ll admit I&#39;m shit with literature, so if I&#39;ve worded this wrong, forgive me. Thanks</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Have you ever heard of organizations like &quot;Moveon.org&quot; or &quot;Center for American Progress&quot;? They organize protests all the time. Those are openly funded protest organizers. The ones that a paid to violently protest do so by other means. </p>

<p>Check out the website for DisruptJ20. They openly offered food and transportation, along with <em>legal support</em> for anyone who were to be arrested. They can&#39;t openly incite a riot, that would be stupid. But they can damn well imply it. Not everyone on the street that day needs to be paid. Only a few organizers and instigators. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for the info, I appreciate it. I don&#39;t think offering to cover their legal expenses is the same as outright paying them, but it is better than anything else I&#39;ve gotten so far.</p>

<p>I take no issue with the claim that some protestors are paid btw, just the claim they&#39;re specifically being paid to be violent.</p>

<p>I&#39;m interested in seeing what happens with that disruptJ20 thing, hopefully anyone who incited violence is legally punished. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s no evidence that these people pay protesters, which is what this post is really about: complaining that people want to see any evidence beyond a craigslist ad or 4chan text.</p>

<p>In my view, right-wing conspiracists are pretty damned stupid. They believe in these all-powerful liberal elites that can assassinate with impunity, arrange paid protests at the drop of a hat, run large pedophile rings out of public restaurants with online web presence on the open web, arrange for millions of illegal votes, all without leaving any evidence or getting caught, but they can&#39;t figure out how to get votes in the right states to win an election. It&#39;s a comically absurd combination of brilliant villainy and gross incompetence. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Every time I see a fucky thread, I start clicking on the usernames above comments that seem only to exist to distract and belittle the point of a valid thread.</p>

<p>Its a very telling exercise. You see people with accounts that have only posted in this subreddit once or twice, or that comment is their first. And then you start to click on the usernames of the circlejerk comments beneath them and you see users active in subs like &quot;conspiratard&quot; and &quot;top minds&quot;.</p>

<p>I have seriously considered taking a weekend and compiling all of the data into a post, but honestly, then I start to think &quot;shit, am I really going to spend 8 or 10 hours following all of these usernames and making screenshots and then finding a clear way to present the data, only to be belittled, gang-downvoted, and attacked by the exact same tactics I am trying to highlight&quot;.</p>

<p>Its fucking depressing. I hate to say it but at the end of the day, these groups of people manipulating and destroying this subreddit are just that: groups. And it is very hard for one person to go against multiple people. Plus they have been gaslighting this sub so hard since the election that many of the silent majority are now having a hard time even filtering out the truth from the bullshit.</p>

<p>They have vote bots that search for keywords. Pizzagate has long been a downvote magnet. Soros is a downvote magnet recently because he&#39;s sponsoring the fake violence with Antifa and the regime doesn&#39;t want this to get out.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I choose not to comment usually, because the only replies I will get are from non-conspiracy types. People who clearly do not belong in this subreddit. People who believe the mainstream media.</p>

<p>I do not care to argue with people who are closed minded.</p>

<p>I participate by voting. RES says i&#39;ve upvoted you 11 times before this post, now 12.</p>

<p>I think you&#39;re right about the silent actual conspiracy users. Usually when I see posts that I would consider to belong in this subreddit, and have gained a lot of traction. The top comments are always 100% against the post. Yet the posts themselves are highly upvoted. Contradicting the comments.</p>

<p>I think the only solution is abandoning Conspiracy and making a new subreddit that is private, invite only. And a team of like 10 or so high integrity moderators. And when a moderator of the private subreddit, comes across a likeminded individual, they can invite them.</p>

<p>There are quite a few users here who i&#39;ve upvoted 10+ times. Anybody like that would be a candidate for moderator.</p>

<p>There was ConspiracyII, but the head moderator decided it was a good idea to collaborate with Topmindsofreddit. The dumbest decision he could&#39;ve made. Since that happened I don&#39;t trust that subreddits leadership.</p>

<p>I would start that private subreddit myself, but that&#39;s quite a lot of work, i&#39;m too lazy for that. I would be a moderator though.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The left lost badly last year. Part of the reason for that is because they cannot control social media like they do with legacy media (newspaper, tv). They will not allow that to happen again. Their goal is to suppress all non-sanctioned opinion from social media, through either outright censorship or a barrage of propaganda across all platforms. We have already seen the censorship on google, twitter, facebook, and reddit, and it&#39;s not going to stop.  </p>

<p>Anyone who has read wikileaks should recognize what&#39;s happening. Podesta&#39;s buddies talked about keeping people uninformed and compliant, and pushing people into strong echo chambers so that they could control the messaging. What we are seeing now is this strategy being taken to the extreme out of desperation.</p>

<p>The reason I&#39;m skeptical of the &quot;guys, both sides are bad, don&#39;t pay attention to the partisan fighting about this issue&quot; is because it can also be deliberate misdirection.  My side is getting a bad rap for something, what can we do to counter?</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Smear the enemy - Make them look just as bad to excuse what we&#39;re doing.  We&#39;re just reacting to the bad guys, and you can&#39;t say that those guys aren&#39;t bad because they obviously are!</p></li>
<li><p>Blame the source and outside agendas - Guys, it&#39;s totally the media that&#39;s wanting us to get riled up, just ignore it all</p></li>
<li><p>Condemn both sides - This is deflection masquerading as &quot;unity&quot;.  Guys, let&#39;s band together and fight these evils!  We are united and won&#39;t stand for any of this (especially the ones that we all know are worse!)</p></li>
</ol>

<p>The end result is that attention is no longer on your team.  Success!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not really. Whereas the civil war had very clear geographic dividing lines, the current situation we are facing would lead to a much more dire situation since it would literally be neighbor vs neighbor.</p>

<p>Maybe you are the one who is divorced from reality. Especially if you think that ideas like this are up for debate:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There are thousands of men and women in this country who have seen war and death and don’t want any more to do with it. They want to live in peace. They want to forget the things they’ve had to do in the service of their country. They want to raise their kids and have family BBQs and build tree houses and soap box derby cars and have tea parties.</p>

<p>They don’t want this crap that you’re selling. You have the extremist left and the extremist right that are doing their best to get something started. To force us into a Civil War.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It isn&#39;t non-partisan at all. It doesn&#39;t outright say it, for the sake of deniability, but it is heavily implying that a majority (if not all) of the counter-protesters in Charlotsville (and Trump protesters in general) are being paid to do so, completely ignoring the myriad of reasons people would protest.</p>

<p>The only notable counter protest was the one in Charlotsville. There haven&#39;t been any notable counter-protests done by conservative groups. So the fact that the letter specifically refers to counter-protesters rather than regular protesters or ralliers means that it&#39;s addressing a specific group rather than being general.</p>

<p>Also, this is ignoring the fact that <em>there isn&#39;t any proof that anyone was being paid to counter-protest</em>. The only group being accused of being paid is the counter protest. The closest is a Craigslist ad with no proof of being answered (or real) and &quot;eye-witness&quot; reports from the highly-reputable 4chan.</p>

<p>Did some of the counter-protesters use violence? Yes. Does that discredit the entire counter-protest? No. This letter is a prime example of bias trying to come across as neutral, because it addresses a problem that doesn&#39;t exist and is only being accused by one side to the other.</p>

<p>This shit is seriously so annoying. It&#39;s often combined with going wayyy out of one&#39;s way to ignore the context of a conversation and then acting smug about it.</p>

<p>It&#39;s so common amongst Trump supporters that it makes me think there&#39;s some &quot;rules for arguing online&quot; passed out amongst his supporters. Reminds me of an argument I had here where some dude was saying &quot;ShareBlue employees&quot; have taken over the sub, but acted like I was an idiot for assuming he was talking about shills.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t care what views someone holds, just be honest and stand by your own words.</p>

<p>I start to wonder this too.  I see the same talking points coming up from different people at  the same time.  I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s the ease of social media sharing or some specific guidelines, but there are definitely common tactics being used.  It&#39;s really interesting.</p>

<p>There are a total of thirteen posts across Reddit with this same content, most of which are just crossposts by bots, three or four instances of one user posting multiple times to a tiny subreddit called r/uncensorship—and all but one of those crossposts link to the version posted in r/conspiracy </p>

<p>The one bot that made a post linking to the r/the_donald version belongs to a subreddit designed to mock content posted in r/the_donald</p>

<p>So I wouldn&#39;t necessarily call this &quot;T_D is pushing it now&quot;</p>

<p>It shouldn&#39;t matter what comes after that, but what does come after that is a bunch of silly bullshit about blood and guts and being a Marine.  Any armed forces member of the united states trying telling anyone at all they don&#39;t have access to the 1st amendment is a traitor. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>yeah the &quot;no 1st amendment rights&quot; line was a dead giveaway that this letter was bullshit, and more than likely not written by a member of the armed forces let alone a retired general.  But while the rest of the letter is equally nonsensical, it actually comes off as quite sinister when you read into it a bit.</p>

<p>The whole letter is an exercise in conflating counter protestors with paid protestors, and then paid protestors with violent protestors.  All this is framed in a peculiar flavor of Age and &quot;Wisdom&quot; speaking to youth, folksy, silent majoritese, Navy SEAL copypasta tone that I find unbearably condescending and seems totally out of place in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> - I mean a(n alleged) United States general dictating first amendment rights, telling us that all the good, simple folks of America will/should fuckin kill you if you rock the boat?  That&#39;s textbook authoritarianism.  That&#39;s everything this sub should oppose.</p>

<p>After the &quot;mercenaries have no 1A rights&quot; stuff, there are two pretty explicit references to murdering the subjects of the letter. Mercenaries or protestors?  it gets muddy fast - and given the that recent protests have seen a lot of open carry by some of the same folks that frequent the online circles in which this letter might be shared... well, its not hard to see the danger.  Frankly, given the heat of the rhetoric on both sides I think it&#39;s amazing that we have seen so little actual violence irl - 3 fatal incidents?  a dozen or so brawls or beatings?  Nonzero, for sure, but pretty good for a nation of 300 million+ with as many firearms.  That could change quickly if just one person internalizes this letter&#39;s message and uses it to justify pulling the trigger.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a frequency illusion effect here, and elements of the media are working overtime to perpetuate it and deepen the divisions in our country.  This letter is a cowardly and grotesque attempt encourage a further escalation of violence, and I hope anyone who signal boosts it thinks very carefully about what they are doing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Its not just the top comment,  at this moment the top ~15 comments all conform to this same narrative. Not only do these comments dismiss the notion of paid protesters as if it was bigfoot,  but they almost unanimously seem to be attacking from the left.  Its also interesting that these same comments all seem to be attacking from the left,  considering that the OP was very careful about laying the blame equally on both the right and the left.  </p>

<p>The concept of paid protestors has never been particularly controversial on this sub.  If the people manipulating this sub want their machinations to be remotely believable,  they would be wise to learn what the general tone and opinion of this sub was like before they started manipulating things... because whats happening now is blatantly obvious. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh, right. So there is not a debate on whether or not people are paid to protest. Note I didn&#39;t claim that people are or are not being paid to protest, I claimed that there is a debate, which is evidenced by differing opinions on the topic. </p>

<p>I think it&#39;s safe to say that if you told the majority of people (not on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>) that people were being paid to protest, they would either ask for proof or argue. </p>

<p>My ultimate point is that someone who disagrees with the paid-protesters narrative doesn&#39;t make them an astroturfer, as OP implied. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t you find it a problem that instead of acquiescing and providing proof of the claims in that letter that people are trying to discredit those asking for it by insinuating that they are shills?  Conspiracy theorists should be skeptical by nature, but it seems like those asking for evidence to back up the claims made in a post are being made out to be the issue instead of those blindly accepting a story because they want to believe it&#39;s true.  I mean, the original poster of this very thread has done everything that they can to avoid providing literally any proof while ignoring the context and nuance in that letter so they can pretend it is non-partisan.

    <div class="md"><p>Same exact thing that is happening to this thread.  </p>

<p>Liberalism simply can not survive on it&#39;s own.  Censorship is vital for liberalism to exist.  Though liberals make up a very small percentage of America it seems like everyone is liberal because of media hollywood and music.  Censoring conservative ideas while championing liberal ideas on web sites also makes the appearance that liberals are more numerous.  </p>

<p>Most important part of censorship is protecting their base from the truth.  If a liberal is ever introduced to the truth they instantly stop being a liberal.  This is why college admissions are so lax now.  Colleges have been trying to indoctrinate students into liberalism since at least the 60&#39;s.  It just didn&#39;t work because we used to send our best and brightest to college.  Most college students were logical so of course they rejected liberalism.  Now that we send idiots to college it&#39;s finally taken hold there.</p>

<p>The solution is quite simple.  Hold companies to the same standard for conservatives and liberals.  If a company bans conservative speech from their platform they should be fined.  If it happens enough shut them down.  If gays can get bakeries fired for not participating in an event that&#39;s against their religion surely we can hold companies responsible for violations of free speech.</p>

<p>I know this may be hard for you to follow, but the <em>establishment</em> is made up of families and organizations that have been <strong>established</strong> in Washington DC for multiple decades and centuries.</p>

<p>Trump may be a piece of shit, a member of the 1%, and part of his own tribe of established real estate NYC moguls, but that is absolutely not the same as being a member of what is referred to as &quot;the establishment&quot; or &quot;tptb&quot;.</p>

<p>This is what Chuck Schumer  Deep State) told trump when Trump announced he was going to audit the CIA. &quot;Let me tell you: You take on the intelligence community — they have six ways from Sunday at getting back at you&quot;</p>

<p>Paid Protesters are a real phenomena, therefore what I have just claimed is factually correct.</p>

<p>...see why that doesn&#39;t work? This is supposed to be a sub about critical thinking and not accepting what you are told. I don&#39;t know why asking for proof of a spurious claim is now considered a bad thing here.</p>

<p>Yet the post doesn&#39;t ever mention Charlottesville. And the language used is deliberately non-partisan.</p>

<p>You and many others seem to only be able to see that post as some kind of &quot;attack from t_d&quot;.</p>

<p>And many of us just took the post for what was actually written and didn&#39;t see any of the ridiculous &quot;secret undertones&quot; that you people seem to see everywhere. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t you find it a problem that instead of acquiescing and providing proof of the claims in that letter that people are trying to discredit those asking for it by insinuating that they are shills?  Conspiracy theorists should be skeptical by nature, but it seems like those asking for evidence to back up the claims made in a post are being made out to be the issue instead of those blindly accepting a story because they want to believe it&#39;s true.  I mean, the original poster of this very thread has done everything that they can to avoid providing literally any proof while ignoring the context and nuance in that letter so they can pretend it is non-partisan. I&#39;m not sure whether I find this hilarious or frustratingly sad.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>its not that people dont believe, we just need proof.  posting an ad on craigslist or 4chan can be anyone.  we shouldnt just be circulating shit for the hell of it, post it so we can discuss if its true and how we can obtain evidence of such, dont just post it and go &quot;look what i found!&quot; because there is no proofs.  thats what you need to keep in mind is that people arent disagreeing because they are against you, they just know we cant fall into a cycle of posting b.s. and everyone here kust taking it as truth.  tjats the biggest problem across the land is that people just accept what is told to them instead of asking questions.  dont feel defensive when people bring shit up, try to answer it and if you cant try to find something/someone who can.  sick of people looking at an argument as a battle to win instead of a chance to qualify or disqualify an idea/information.  be ready to change your mind, its ok to be wrong.</p>

I&#39;d guess Something around states rights vs. federal rights. 
I have no definite answer  because it is the nature of the powers that be. If we knew maybe we&#39;d have a chance to stop it. But it seems most are unwillingly marching along to it&#39;s inevitably , some running headfirst into it. 
Those are insignificant noncritical  issues compared to what&#39;s at stake.
I can definitely see 1984 starting to arise in our society ,
