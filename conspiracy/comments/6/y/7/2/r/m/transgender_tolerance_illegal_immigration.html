       LGBT rights don't take rights away from you. Transgender tolerance in no way effects you. You are trying to preserve white privilege with this post. All you need is to shit talk affirmative action and it would be the stereotypical angry white guy post.

       He'd probably say that individuals are quite capable of determining their own moral frameworks without out having self-serving organizations do it for us. Or he'd say give $500 to Jerry Falwell to help him battle Satan's "demons" on Earth. I always get that mixed up.

       So the last commenter was a "typical snowflake," but you're proving to be little more than frightened and triggered. Ensuring equal rights for people does not take anything away from you, and this is coming off more as you finding homosexuality to be incredulous.

       I don't remember Jesus ever pandering for money so I'm not sure how to address the second half of your comment.

       Pointing out hypocrisy is "frightened and triggered?" Both sides are manipulated, but the liberal sockpuppets are a special sort of gullible.

       Ohh makes sense to an extent. Sorry, the OP comes off way more bigoted than you make it to be here. It seemed like the issue was the introduction of those additional guaranteed rights, not the method by which the rights were pushed on society. I get your point and agree for the most part.

       Yes and no. One is a potential life, while the other is living and breathing in front of you. You bring up a good point; that's why the debate becomes so heated I suppose. Oh well, as long as everyone is distracted by argument over these topics, those in power are free to do what they really want.

       When transgender high school athletes are competing with girls without any medical changes, it does impact society. When high school girls have to accept women with penises in their locker rooms, it does impact those girls and their families. I am not saying I agree or disagree with Any of these things but to act like the debate on incorporating transgender persons into all aspects of society is without impact is sort of selfish.  There are very real issues that need to be considered and worked out. It's not the same thing as gay rights.

       Can you provide sources for the above cases? I bet for every case you find that supports the above statements I can find at least 10 where the opposite is true. Where transgender teens are constantly bullied to the point of suicide. Cases of gay youth and suicide were quite high not too long ago. Transgender may be sensationalized by MSM but MSM is far from lived experiences of everyday teens struggling with the issues.
      </p>
      <p>
       This isn't solely about left/right, democrats/republican politics in America. It is about creating forums where we as people can talk about these issues to arrive at some understanding for the lived experiences of others rather than sweep them under the rug out of fear and ignorance.

       Those two things aren't equal opposites I'm sorry to tell you. Getting bullied and changing your sex to compete with a different gender are not the same. Men are stronger and more physical on the whole. Period. Men and women are different. If they weren't - why is it so important for transgendered people to live as one or the other?
      </p>
      <p>
       Getting bullied sucks. But honestly I think every kid gets a touch of it growing up. Overcome it. Be strong. That's all you can do.

       And the "touch" of bullying you received is not an equal opposite to the bullying trans people receive. Obviously you have to be strong, anyone saying otherwise is a dumb fuck. And ofcourse men and women are different, anyone saying otherwise is a bigger dumb fuck. But you have given zero reasons why we should not at least try to be somewhat accommodating and understanding and you are coming off as someone who just doesn't want anything to happen so you don't have to think about a complex issue.

       I think zero percent about that issue BECAUSE as per my last post - if that makes you happy fucking go for it. Fucking do it.

      <p>
       If I overheard someone "bullying" a transgendered person - you know what, I'd likely stick up for that person, depending on the situation. I can't always be captain fucking planet, but I'd definitely assess the situation and see what I can bring to it/not. That's me and how I'd deal with things. That's all I can really say.

       I'm not saying you have to stand up for anybody, but you're doing yourself a disservice by not thinking more on the issue. It's complicated and every human defaults to disliking things that are different. It''s on you to dig into complex/foreign topics and find out if it's an acceptable or unacceptable difference and why.

       I'm fine with whatever you do. Period. If you're into changing your sex I don't care. I'm for someone having an abortion. Honestly I don't think I could even do it. That's not for me. I don't think I could ever decide that. But if someone wants to I understand them wanting to and that's that. I wouldn't protest against it. I wouldn't protest for it. If you want to do it, do that.

       But white privilege? Go be ANY of those things you mentioned in a non-white country. I'm sorry but white people are the most accepting of all these liberal changes. I think for the most part white people are just done hearing about it. Go fucking do what you need to do and fuck off about it. There is no freer countries in the world than "white" countries.

       Just anecdotal evidence that "white privilege" does not exist and is a tool used to keep people blaming eachother. If people realize it is the elite class oppressing us all equally, instead of their white suburban neighbors, it might help a tad.

       The transgendered and LGBT agenda definitely affects you if you're trying to raise kids. I am a young dude and I didn't know what being gay was till I was probably 11. Now kids are encouraged to be questioning from the get go. It's not good to sexually confuse kids before they can comprehend what sex is.

       Please, look it up. Rome was Christian before the fall to the Northern Europeans.

      <p>
       Ruling from 379 to 395, Emperor Theodosis I was the first emperor to decree that all citizens should be Christian.

       Did you know causation=correlation? What kind of silly bull is this. I'm sure the fall of Rome had nothing to do with the increasing power of land owners outside of Rome acquiring more power under the increasingly widespread feudal system of production leading to a lessening dependence on Rome; or that increasing temperatures and more advanced farming methods led to a huge population boom in Northern Europe, which was unable to be sustained leading then to pillage (among other things) the southern lands. No I'm sure Rome fell because the people worshiped one god instead of another god.

 But I would cite the land stolen from the small land holders as a major part of the problem as well.

       Well that's where we return to moral relativism: no one knows anymore so most just default to legality aka the state rather than try philosophy.

       I could hash out some pretty sound arguments on how bad things like abortion, porn, and the current culture of sex are detrimental to society but they'll go unheard because 'you can't judge me'

       A new forefront of this battle is doctor assisted suicide- of that's becomes commonplace the state will eventually get a say in who loves and dies. Check out that whole Charlie Gard fiasco.

       How do you define morality? Subjectively or objectively?
      </p>
      <p>
       Tptb for some time now have sought to undermine any kind of objective moral knowledge on place of subjective 'feel good' morality. Where the person defines for themselves what is right and wrong. Making it more an emotional argument.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since no can argue the ground they stand on they rely on the courts to decide for them and they become precedents.

       Morality is objective; it isn't dictated my majority.

       "Acceptance" as long as you shut the fuck up if your thoughts aren't within "acceptable" bounds. I thought the least common ground we all share here is that attempts to ban a certain type of speech is an attack on freedom itself.

       Yes, not accepting someone is unacceptable. It's hypocritical but to me, it's preferable to allowing intolerance of things people can't change. I can't change what religion my parents were or the color of my skin, I can change not acting like an asshole to people who come from different backgrounds or don't believe the same things as me.

       Its all a game of Victim Points to the Left. Its whatever you can do to get the most Victim Points and let everyone else know how many Victim Points you have. and If you can't get enough Victim Points then you need to show everyone how much of a stink you can put up on behalf of people with Victim Points and how offended you can be on someone else behalf so you gain pseudo-Victim Points. and if you don't play their game, you're a White Supremacist and your're the one creating all the victims.

       So the last commenter was a "typical snowflake," but you're proving to be little more than frightened and triggered. Ensuring equal rights for people does not take anything away from you, and this is coming off more as you finding homosexuality to be incredulous.
