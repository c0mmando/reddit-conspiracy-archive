       Found this letter attributed to Geoffrey B. Higginbotham, Major General, USMC (Ret.). Wanted to share it here.
      </p>
      <p>
       A Word To The Wise
      </p>
      <p>
       “If you are paid $25.00 an hour to show up to a rally to “counter” the other party using physical force and violence, you are not a “counter protestor.” You are a mercenary.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is no need for further debate on this. You were paid to attack someone you don’t know for reasons that you couldn’t care enough about to go there for free. You did your “job” and collected your check and your reimbursement of expenses. You’re a mercenary.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not a Patriot. Not a Social Justice Warrior. Not a Defender of Freedom or Liberty. Not an upholder of Truth or Justice. None of those things you claim to be. You are a mercenary.
      </p>
      <p>
       And mercenaries are not lawful combatants and deserve whatever comes their way at the hands of the people they are attacking.
      </p>
      <p>
       You have no 1st Amendment rights when you’re a mercenary.
      </p>
      <p>
       Doesn’t matter what side you’re on. Doesn’t matter what cause you’re showing up to disrupt. If you can’t express yourself peacefully through diplomatic means, then you better be prepared to meet your maker at the hands of someone who is only barely keeping their own violent tendencies at bay through a massive exercise of self-control.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know it sounds romantic to attend these rallies and get crap started with the other side. And when you’re young and passionate, it’s really easy to get whipped up into a frenzy of raw emotions. There is a reason why young people are preferred when it comes to warfare. They are easy to manipulate and control and set off.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I’m telling you all this right now. You’ve got no idea what road you are starting down. Romance and idealism wears off really fast when you’re laying in a pool of your own blood trying to stuff your intestines back into your torn abdomen.
      </p>
      <p>
       I’ve been lucky enough to go forty-two years without having to put the skills I learned in the Marines to use. I continue to train and keep those skills up to date because I see the madness that is happening all across this country. I don’t train to attack others like you do. I train to defend others FROM you. I’m not alone either.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are thousands of men and women in this country who have seen war and death and don’t want any more to do with it. They want to live in peace. They want to forget the things they’ve had to do in the service of their country. They want to raise their kids and have family BBQs and build tree houses and soap box derby cars and have tea parties.
      </p>
      <p>
       They don’t want this crap that you’re selling.
      </p>
      <p>
       You have the extremist left and the extremist right that are doing their best to get something started. To force us into a Civil War. Even in the 1860’s, the violence between the North and South was nowhere near what we see today. Nowhere. Even. Close.
      </p>
      <p>
       And yet we still had a war of ideology that consumed hundreds of thousands of lives.
      </p>
      <p>
       All you young and naive kids on both sides of this equation who think that having a Civil War will advance your agenda or restore your vision of what you think is America, just remember this… Those of us older generations aren’t having any of this crap. And if you jump off, you better be prepared to deal with US. We don’t care what color you’re wearing or what sign you’re holding if you come after us, our friends, our family, our co-workers, our neighbors, etc., WE will kill you.
      </p>
      <p>
       So remember that when you’re thinking that it’s just Left vs Right, or Liberal vs Conservative, or Commie vs. Fascist. We are the variable you’re not considering.
      </p>
      <p>
       That “Silent Majority” that you pretend does not exist is getting really sick and tired of your bullshit.
      </p>
      <p>

       Is there any real evidence or people coming out that they were paid $25 or whatever to take part in a riot or even a protest? I don't take craigslist adds as evidence btw. Most of the "evidence" that I have seen was either debunked or actual satire by antifa and other organisations.
      </p>
      <p>
       This feels more like a strawman argument to make any protest against your point out to be illegitimate

      <p>
       Why? Is there any law against mercenaries that I don't know? Are soldiers not also basically mercenaries (getting paid for violence).

      <p>
       The individual quoted is specifically talking about people paid to protest in a fashion NOT peaceful. So your second point is true, but not what is being discussed.
      </p>
      <p>
       If we're not talking about a violent definition of "attack" then obviously you're correct. But the focus of the entire quote posted by OP is clearly about violence. So I don't even know why you're mentioning the peaceful protesters.

       Because by the posts definition, being paid makes you a mercenary it doesn't say being a violent mercenary forfeits your rights, but being one at all does and that's simply not true.

       This is literally clear as bloody day; the discussion is about people who are
       <em>
        paid
       </em>
       to use
       <em>
        physical force
       </em>
       and
       <em>
        violence
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       What you have difficulty with is the paid part. I can understand that, because I've not personally seen concrete proof either. But it's a hypothetical discussion at the very least.
       <em>
        IF
       </em>
       you were paid to cause violence,
       <em>
        THEN
       </em>
       you are legally classified as a mercenary.

       I think that's a tangential point.
      </p>

       The point is that people who think they're riding a gravy train, violently getting involved in a fight they're only interested in as a result of money, means that sprucing up the rhetoric with terms like "counter protester" is complete bullshit. They're literal criminals. And as you say, violence immediately negates 1st amendment rights. So violent protesters, or even legit protesters, who might yell and scream about the freedom of speech and expression of those getting violent, are entirely wrong.

       To the edit, haha you too, don't look at my post history. I'm not super popular on here being pretty liberal. It's not usually this nice but I do tend to respond only in kind.

      <p>
       I agree with all of your main post as well. i.e. ANTIFA as an idea is something I might support, but going around breaking shit because a campus hosts a speaker they don't like is self defeating. You can't fight fascism by not allowing dissent. It's like the definition of being a fascist.

       I just think most of this discussion is moot as there really hasn't been proof they're being paid.

       ANTIFA's violence blows my mind in all the worst ways. The hypocrisy is so blatant that I don't even know where to start, or what the point would be in pointing it out.

       I'm not especially popular either XP I certainly don't discriminate based on political ideology. I probably fall on the liberal side of the spectrum generally, but I also appreciate some conservative views. That some seem to think one needs to pick a side eliminates the reality of a political spectrum and compresses everything into a binary: For or against. As much as I can fall victim to the all-or-none paradigm at times, it's nonsense.
      </p>
      <p>
       Someone did post a bunch of info re: paid protesters here in the comments, though at a very brief glance it did not appear that they were paid specifically to commit violence, so much as ideally they would incite violence from their opposition. However, I imagine some did themselves commit violence, quite possibly a very small minority of these paid protesters, and so the message is addressing (potentially) a very small number of individuals.
      </p>
      <p>
       The point may or may not be especially relevant as it stands, but generally it is correct by definition.

       ive been in a class in college where a guy spoke before us to say a bunch of students were taking a bus and carpooling up to another school to protest tuition hikes. thats likely what this is. it doesnt seem like a big deal at all. far from getting paid 100 bucks for a day of rioting or something

       The majority of extremists on both sides are jobless, you'd think they would jump at the opportunity to do "work" for the causes they believe in if it actually paid money. The reality is both sets of extremists mistakenly believe that a large chunk of the rest of society silently agrees with them so they need strong mental Gymnastics to explain away the gap between their belief and the reality that they are fringe groups with little support.

       Agreed. Interestingly enough, you will see media groups from both ends of the political spectrum push the idea that the extremists on both ends represent the majority of both sides. That's one of the reasons that I believe the media is responsible for the division in this country.
      </p>
      <p>
       I listen to quite a bit of conservative media and they do this regularly. I know that more left-leaning media does this as well. Even though people will complain that they are tired of liberal media painting anyone on the right as old, white, and racist, they will overgeneralize and misrepresent the majority of folks on the left without an ounce of self-awareness.

       My go-to example of the way that partisan figures exaggerate the people they don't like to a ludicrous degree is Sean Hannity continuously giving airtime to the head of the New Black Panthers. He is the only person doing that, or giving any attention to the New Black Panthers whatsoever. It's just a guy that Hannity saw and said to himself, "they'll eat this up with a spoon".

       I'm not. My opinion is that when you have both sides complaining about paid agitators but neither one has any concrete evidence it's possible that it's not even happening. Both sides are triggered by this because it knocks the wind out of their sales. They both claim the other side is more violent to vindicate their own violence and they both claim the other side is placing paid agitators among their ranks because it's hard for people to accept that legit loonies commonly hold the similar extremist political views as the alt-right and the communists and are drawn to these movements. The end result is you have people on both sides of the aisle mostly fed up with poor governance harming the people of the United States but the only people voicing opinions on how to fix things are blaming their problems on other disadvantaged groups. The great majority of us in the US work significantly harder than we are paid for but we are taught that other impoverished groups in our country are the reason for our suffering. It's tough but we all need to look past skin color, religion, creed, and any other bullshit arbitrary reason to hate each other. We need to look for our similarities: we all want to be successful, raise families, grow as individuals but we fight over how it's to be done. We can all do better for ourselves and our neighbors by just giving a fuck.

       he cant find anybody to hire him as a protestor? werent there 20k at boston? I guess if he made a film like this he'd basically be making his own fictional drama, hiring actors to play all parts. at this point he should be shopping the idea to netflix and amazon

       Who are "people like me"?  People that don't like Trump's "charity" funding this attention seeker?  People that don't fall for his obviously edited videos?

      <p>
       Maybe you've never heard of Juan Carlos Vera, who called the police on O'Keefe because he believed O'Keefe really wanted to import women to use as prostitutes, and who successfully sued him.  That's just one example of a confirmed fake video, and there are many more.

       It would be difficult to film someone responding to an ad, showing up to an interview, getting the job, showing up to a protest, waiting two weeks and getting a paycheck in the mail. That's a lot of filming time.
      </p>
      <p>
       Because if ANY of those are missing, or cut, then...
      </p>
      <p>
       The ad doesn't relate to the interview. The interview doesn't relate to the protest. The protest doesn't relate to the pay. The pay is fake and in a fake letterhead to filmmaker put into the mailbox before going back to their house and "filming" opening the box. The interview was with a friend and not an official.
      </p>
      <p>
       You'd need to Truman Show at least three weeks to make that work, and even then, it would need to be with a PERFECT camera, because the slightest temporary blur is evidence it is tampered with. After all, Star Wars had the guy saying lines he never said by splicing film on-screen, so too could this hypothetical filmmaker if there's any blurring.

       The fuck would they give them a receipt for, I feel like it defeats the purpose of hiding the fact that you are funding a protest. Has any one here actually taken Craigslists jobs before, especially an event job? 50% of the time they pay those out in cash, since it's a drop in the bucket for the people paying for whatever menial shit they need done.
      </p>

       Send an ad, get replies, delete said ad so if anyone took a screenshot it will be disputed and people won't consider it worth arguing. Then pay your employees in cash or "travel reimbursement" lol.

       No, aimed at the jobless ones who are suffering in their circumstance with no way to make their way to Berkeley and so on. It's aimed at anyone post college or in college, because instead of realizing the college institution jipped them out of their money, they are blaming the Koch brothers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Paying them just helps pad numbers for the perception of a massive grassroots movement, because how do you argue against the will.of the people. I remember similar rhetoric with the tea party in early 2000. The real trouble makers are paid by someone more nefarious, whether part of the police or paid to create violence.
      </p>
      <p>
       They aren't giving those guys that much responsibility in the groups besides being 'operation human shield' for the "By any Means Necessary" and groups like that, they just want them to maybe smash a few windows and protect the ideologues.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes, if your numbers aren't what you expect, it makes sense to pay protestors. Perception is key in this silly media war right?

       The receipt is for, mostly, the benefit of whomever would pay protesters. 1) for thier active participation, and 2) most importantly, for thier confidentiality.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, say I wanna find 100 people to show up and protest Futurama seasons 1 through 5 being removed from Netflix. But, I want it to look organic, and totally not something that I orchestrated. If I'm offering incentives for participating, then it is in my best interest to also insure that they don't undermine my messege by being paid.
      </p>
      <p>
       If I give them cash, then they can take it and just go home. If I pay them after the demonstration, then they can go home and blog about this quick buck they just made and tell others how to do so.
      </p>
      <p>
       To keep it quiet, there needs to be something agreed to, beyond a verbal agreement, if I want to keep my involvement a secret. If I pay them, and give them a form saying "this is money for your participation, by accepting payment, you're agreeing to keep this a secret or else we demand our money back."  if I pay them and don't notify them of the expectation of secrecy, they'll sell thier story to literally anyone with an interest in exposing my involvement, undermining any affect of the demonstration, because why not?
      </p>
      <p>
       Why not take 2 paydays instead of 1,with basically zero extra work?
      </p>
      <p>
       So, without an agreement, none of the "independent paid demonstrators" theory makes any sense.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the age of social media, it would have to be orchestrated by an agency in charge of a collective, none of any of the operating agents could have a social media presence that could be linked to one another at all, in anyway. Because the agency in charge of the individual actors would have all of thier names on file, whatever contracts they operate for, and a means to pay them. Connect 2 of the employees, and you can extrapolate that there are more of those kinds of paid demonstrators, and a little digging exposes my involvement, because I'd have to pay the agency, as well as have verified agreement with them, or they could just take my money and have a pizza party.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like Futurama is important to my interests, so I understand how helpful a big demonstration would be to make my point. But if I can't garner interest from people through excitement or passion, then there is only really intimidation or a paper trail means to get people to show up. And knowing it's my mission and my cause, I would not expect some agency to cover the costs of putting on an artificial demonstration just to make it look more real, because profit is how companies stay in business, and why would they trust me to pay them if I'm willing to pay a bunch of people for misleading the public for my own interests.

       I can see that, but I also see a society with very vitriolic people and systems to search out those individuals are becoming easier to congregate (former protests, Facebook groups, and such). It's kinda like that joke how people who used to have sex with animals always felt alone and like freaks until they discovered internet chattrooms. It's also the reason it's easier to gather all the bigots in easy places and subreddits like the dreaded coontown.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, it's much easier with the actual black bloc protesters and groups like By Any Means Necessary since they police their own and are hypervigilant to anyone filming them. They already act with secrecy and will block out anyone but their video of the event to frame it how they want, of course the conservative YouTubers do enjoy antagonizing but that seems like a two way street.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd look more to those organizations and how they plan, and execute their protests, along with their messaging public and private, but I don't think I could fake it that hard to get in anyway to find out.
      </p>
      <p>
       People with money have infiltrated protests and movements before and often in American history.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now I don't want to pin this all on Soros and the like, because I think this is more multilateral involving paid actors in the Alt-Right, which I believe based on the lack of funding they receive from fans online, unless it's funded through Bitcoin, which most Hatreon users accept.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course there is also the aspect of cops infiltrating as Black Bloc to incite violence like happened in Canada around 2007-10

       The amount of violence I've seen doesn't seem natural compared to occupy wall street and other movements, this whole year just feels off to me. I don't believe Joe T. CollegeStudent is getting paid though, or the free speech side of the right either. It's the more nefarious sects of both groups that concern me.

       So, I agree with most of you're overall point.... However
      </p>
      <p>
       The data mining and hyper self policing of certain communities means that organizers wouldn't have to pay anyone to show up for a rally.
      </p>
      <p>
       No one on the left would have to find someone to act like a Nazi at a protest, the world is teaming with them. No conservative group needs to find some liberals to go counter protest something, libs are happy to show up and meet like minded folks.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, I agree forever adamently that movements and protests are manipulated to be more antagonistic and violent, but that it's a wholly orchestrated effort (in the US) based in organizations like the CIA. It's scarier than "big money is operating vigilanti mobs" because that would be a mess, especially in capitalism where everyone is trying to run with the bug dogs, you'd have dim, entitled narcissistic ambitious types who fully misunderstood Machiavelli, figured they'd give chess a shot and it'd be practically funny. Litigation everywhere, if anyone got hurt or killed or a check bounced, thier families would sue and blow their cover and destroy the operation.
      </p>
      <p>
       But, American government organizations have a long standing tradition of breaking up opposition groups and love subverting anything that costs the defense department money, including peace organizations and gatherings of the working poor that are suffering from malnutrition and watching thier kids get sicker and sicker from contaminated water.
      </p>
      <p>
       See, you don't need to look too hard to find people with motivation to disrupt free speech. We pay them with taxes, and the money trail stops in the federal government.

       But paying them well enough to keep it completely secret?
      </p>
      <p>
       Unless it's a digital payment, they can't prove that they paid, or that they are owed a refund for, what, breach of a contract.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, that means it's all cash, and based on an honor system, in a vitriolic political climate, and kept totally on the down low.....

       I don't buy it, at all.

       You're making good points. Maybe it's not about what they're paid but something else, like a better job at the end, I don't know.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know there's no proof (yet?) but it seems rather credible to me that some people would go to those lengths to manipulate political opinion and events. (Sorry if it's bad english)

       So, now it's job opportunities, but not in writing, and again, with zero examples of the incentives, digital or otherwise. And at the scale it would need to be, there's no chance regular civilians, normally chatty humans, could keep it under wraps.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like, there are examples of manipulation of public opinion out there that were orchestrated by governments, but those were done by soldiers in street clothes, not some open casting call for who ever.

       Seriously. Soros, CTR, Sandy Hook Crisis Actors, Charlottesville/Berkley violent paid protestors. You'd think, being such a common thing, that you'd have
       <strong>
        someone
       </strong>
       who infiltrated this activity and outed them.
      </p>
      <p>
       A picture of a paystub, details or recordings of shady meetings, links to studios used for auditions or orientations to go over details of these elaborate scenarios.
      </p>
      <p>
       But instead, nothing. Just accusations to draw attention away from the much simpler solution. Needless overly complicated schemes to explain why someone isn't responsible for something and how it's actually someone else's fault.

       Either that or the "Hillary Tapes" that appear in a quick Google search just link to the recordings of Clinton speaking publicly about the case she had to work in the 70s when she defended a rapist. No clue how that relates to paying protestors, but that's what comes you with the phrase he used, "Hillary tapes".

       There should be a Craigslist post, meeting times, cash amounts, protest they wanted you to work, descriptions of people involved, etc. Presumably there would be some of that which would have leaked out.

       A few of my friends and I were talking about this a few weeks back and we came up with a theory(just a theory)... It was that the government(or entities within) find people with some pretty deplorable and repugnant internet searches, and after a vetting process, offer them two choices, join us and we can make all of your sick dreams come true, or we expose the world to what you really are and you go away forever... And if they talk, we release everything and you (and maybe some of your loved ones) "suicide" out of shame... So you just wind up going further into the mirewith no way out.

       The fact that companies that pay people to show up in crowds exist doesn't mean that everyone you accuse of being a paid protester is paid, or that
       <em>
        any
       </em>
       of them are, really. It's a big world, you can find a company that does pretty much anything; that doesn't mean that they're important or have any influence, especially to the scale that conspiritards commonly claim. I don't know why evidence is such a difficult concept to conspiracy theorists. Or maybe it's because they're just seeking out things that confirm conclusions they've already drawn.

       The last true protest was OWS, and that was squashed pretty swiftly.

       There was also tons of underhanded shit done by those companies, including paying people to infiltrate the groups.

       I made when one of those ads was posted here about Vegas/Charlottesville linked to Crowds on Demand. Difficult to verify the ads but Crowds on Demand is a legit company and their CEO that admits that they hire people for: "PR stunts, politicians looking for supporters (or protesters against their opponents), interest groups and individuals.'" There's also the video evidence of DNC operatives admitting to planting 'paid agitators' at events to cause trouble.

       implying it it shows bussed-in Trump supporters but if they are paid protesters that changes things.

        We caught up with Adam Swart, the founder and CEO of Crowds On Demand - a business that pretty much does what it says on the tin.
Swart filled us in on his typical booking: 'We specialise in getting our clients lots of attention. 'The right kind of attention through crowd based action.' Detailing his typical customers, Swart added: 'We work with companies conducting PR stunts,
        <strong>
         politicians looking for supporters (or protesters against their opponents), interest groups and individuals.' Swart confirms US politicians have used his services

       Not sure if relevant but there is a letter from him on the FCC's site on behalf of the National Association of African American-Owned Media (NAAAOM).
      </p>
      <p>
       NAAAOM’s mission is "to eliminate racial discrimination and secure the economic inclusion of truly 100% African American owned media through fair contracting and equal treatment practices."

       Anyway, we already have proof that DNC operatives are prepared to send paid protesters and agent provocateurs to sabotage rallies and events by inciting violence.

       The only person posting anything resembling evidence getting downvoted into oblivion. Hmm.

      <p>
       While obviously the evidence you've presented does not prove or disprove anything beyond a reasonable doubt, this is not a murder trial.
      </p>
      <p>
       It certainly is worth considering and could help piece together a bigger picture.

       My point was that this is not a murder trial that we are trying to prove beynd a reasonable doubt. Reasonable doubt is a great thing and the evidence provided in your post should be included in the discussion, not downvoted into oblivion.

       But as a non-lawyer with access to the internet I am not sure that baiting someone to hitting you is inciting violence. I mean logically it makes sense but I am not sure it is the same thing, and the evidence you provided seems to just be paying someone to provoke other protesters into fighting them.

       If I am wrong or you have other evidence please let me know. To reiterate, shitty but I don't believe it is illegal.

       Fair enough. I was thinking just inciting violence and I wasn't sure that trying to incite violence on your own person could be a crime. But that would definitely fall under inciting a riot.
      </p>
      <p>
       Although that section you quoted should really have the definition of what a riot is, in the section called riots. Apparently just in the next section.

       Isn't it amazing that all these "paid" protestors and yet you don't have a single document or check to prove it? There's no accounts to link to it in any way. And the only "proof" are CL ads and a video that the author refuses to release the uncut video despite having been caught previously using deceptive editing.

       Yup! Any threads about paid agitators, shilling organizations, or bullshit like that gets brigaded hard with non-conspiracy posters and a flood of downvotes for anything against the particular narrative. This isn’t a left or right thing, it happens in both types of threads. Lmao people downvoting a well written comment with sources because they don’t like it, but then mass upvoting comments with no proof that try to deny all of it.

       Project Veritas was responsible for the video, not responsible for Scott Foval and Bob Creamers words. In their own words they admit to hiring mentally ill and homeless to be agitators and create anarchy at poltical events. Are you completely delusional that you think that isn't credible evidence?

       Wow, I can't believe people move the goalposts this far. You're really flailing here when you start questioning the validity of hard video evidence. How often does CNN post all of their "full uncut footage", or any other media outlet for that matter? Oh, that's right, never.

       If he wasn't guilty then all he would need to prove it was uncut footage.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, he wasn't prosecuted because the AG gave him immunity in exchange for the uncut footage. Footage that shows he deliberately misled or outright lied about the content several times.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, why can't you answer the simple question. He was caught deceptively editing his videos to produce a different result than the uncut footage. He has refused to release the uncut footage. Why?

       You think it was faked and somehow with editing those words were put into their mouths.

       Why didn't the two individuals dispute the evidence? Why didn't they sue Project Veritas for defamation and loss of income?

       Uhh, not defending those ideologies, but those are examples of freedom of speech. Remember, your feelings are not always the right feelings. Just because you don't like nazis and racists, doesn't mean they don't have the right to express themselves. The same freedom that allows you to hate them, allows them to hate whoever they want. Now, since I tried to express my un-bias opinion, do as Reddit does and "COMMENCE THE DOWNVOTING!!!"

       I wish the "hate speech" demographic would just come out and admit that they don't want unrestricted expression in any context or any form.  That all they care about is maintaining consensus and ensuring that no one gets their feelings hurt, regardless of what the  facts might be in any situation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Seriously; just admit it.  You hate freedom.  You
       <strong>
        <em>
         want
        </em>
       </strong>
       everyone to be a slave; locked in a 2x2 cubicle for goodness' knows how many hours a day, and unable to do anything other than watch mindless propaganda and consume industrial waste masquerading as food for a few hours at night, before getting up to do the same thing the next day.
      </p>
      <p>
       That is the one reason why I truly, passionately hate Marxists; more than anything else.  Why I instinctively feel
       <strong>
        <em>
         ethically obligated
        </em>
       </strong>
       to hate them.  They refuse to be honest about what they want to destroy, and why they want to destroy it.

       Unbiased or not, it seems like you're trying to justify racially-motivated homicide as "free speech". You either misspoke, didn't read the comment you replied to, or are extraordinarily biased. I'm honestly not sure which one it is.

       Only one of those things was freedom of speech (the chanting). Shooting into a crowd isn't free speech (reckless endangerment more like), yelling "die nigger" is probably assault or at least a criminal threat, and the car... c'mon dude. As for downvotes, you equated crimes with free speech, so I don't know what you expected.

       I also never said they don't have three right to express themselves. Neo-nazis and KKK have as much right to express their views as we do to tell them to shove their views up their asses.

       lumping a group of people together and blaming them all for the actions of a single person is sort of what people are protesting against. don't fall for it. hold the individual accountable for his actions, not the  group he happens to hang with.

       It was a manner of speaking, not meant to infer that crime was committed a thousand times. I thought that was abundantly clear.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the "they weren't all bad" argument, if you mean they aren't all murderers, you're correct. But they're 100% pieces of shit to the last fucking one of them. Here's why:
      </p>
      <p>
       They weren't chanting about General Lee, they were chanting "Jews will not replace us". They weren't carrying signs that tried to cleverly explain their position, they were carrying torches and Nazi flags. And the ones who weren't, stood proudly shoulder to shoulder with those who were. So fuck all of them.
      </p>
      <p>
       If it were a moderate protest, or about General Lee AT ALL, 1) the legitimate protesters would have made those people leave if they outnumbered them, or 2) if the neo-nazis and KKK outnumbered the legitimate protesters,
       <em>
        the legitimate protesters would have left,
       </em>
       not stood side by side with people with SS bolts on their neck doing Nazi salutes. Simple as that. So one more time, since it bears repeating: fuck those Nazi wannabe pieces of filth.

If the other side has facts, it's fake news, deep state treachery, doesn't actually matter because of her emails/Obama was racist/freedom.

       The "other side" here are the elites, all of us are in this shit together, left or right.

       Fake news is a horrible problem going on right now, nobody seems to take the time to follow sources. If its "anonymous" be it CNN's "Anonymous sources" or 4chan's anonymous, it's guaranteed to be a work of fiction.
      </p>
      <p>
       Plus... if we want to go into real conspiracies about what happened, look at the pictures of the guy driving the car before vs the guy who they claimed did it. One looked like an older marine type dude with a hard jaw, the other was some flabby kid.

       That's what his teacher said, but someone else pointed out that it may not be true since he was accepted into the military, if only for a short time. So I'm not sure I believe it anymore. I do think it's ridiculous to assume it was a premeditated attack, and Charlottesville officials obviously agree because he has been charged with 2nd degree murder.

       I saw the whole video. He was up the street from the victims, nobody was attacking his car. Then he started to roll towards them, slowly at first, then accelerated hard. Yes,
       <em>
        as he was driving fast with the obvious intent to hit the victims,

       people started hitting his car. And yes,

       people continued to hit his car. Imagine that.

       No evidence, just a right wing theory because they can't imagine people would get off their 'liberal asses' and try to make a difference otherwise...
and do people really think that in the age of Twitter that the white 20 somethings and young black protesters would be able to keep absolute silence about getting paid? 
It's bullshit. Times are bad but people don't need money to take to the streets and make a stand- there's tons of free motivation. To say anything otherwise is propaganda meant to dull the impact of the people protesting, plain and simple.

       Are you seriously going to sit there and act like there hasn't been a ton of shady shit surrounding protests for years with paid demonstrators clearly linked to a number of dodgy organisations. You're literally falling to the same level as the people you're complaing about by making strawmen of their argument with stupid ad hominem liberal asses bullshit.

       If someone on the right wants to fake it then it'd be like the boy who cried wolf and no matter if it actually came out with some plausible evidence that these protestors were Soros funded, the left would counter by holding that against them and the story would never gain traction. Every time OKeefe gets mentioned here, they hold the acorn story above his head ad nauseum, regardless of the substance of his videos.

       The current evidence that it's happened w antifa seems weak and honestly seems like it'd be counterproductive to their mission- there's plenty of 19 yr old "anarchists" who'd incite violence for antifa- no need to hire. It makes more sense as a tactic to incite the broad public against antifa. Idk.

       I don't know about antifa. But when Black bloc were active, the cops used to dress up like them and start trouble.

       Sigh. No one is denying people pay for crowds. They are asking for evidence that they are paying people for the purpose of committing acts of violence. That part seems to just be made up.

       Depends. Were they the physical aggressor? Then you have one starting violence. But how do you know that they were paid to commit the violence? Clearly most of these people didn't start violence. So I guess they just didn't do their job correctly?

       Yes, there are crowds for hire. Yes, protesters have been hired by various groups in the past. Yes, there have been craigslist ads asking for protesters.

       There where a few during the campaign, done through pacs with documented money trails, it happened like 1-2 times (some new york one and another march that was supposed to go from dc to I forget where think it was Pennsylvania somewhere that completely sputtered out and pretty much barely made the news) and people on the right have been pretty much assuming it's happened every time since.

       To be honest I can't even be mad about that, it's like bringing a knife to a boxing match, no one will ever trust you to play level again.

       Being a mercenary is a very specific term that doesn't apply to people being paid to protest.
      </p>
      <p>
       Art 47. Mercenaries
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        A mercenary shall not have the right to be a combatant or a prisoner of war.
       </li>
       <li>
        A mercenary is any person who:
(a) is especially recruited locally or abroad in order to fight in an armed conflict;
(b) does, in fact, take a direct part in the hostilities;
(c) is motivated to take part in the hostilities essentially by the desire for private gain and, in fact, is promised, by or on behalf of a Party to the conflict, material compensation substantially in excess of that promised or paid to combatants of similar ranks and functions in the armed forces of that Party;
(d) is neither a national of a Party to the conflict nor a resident of territory controlled by a Party to the conflict;
(e) is not a member of the armed forces of a Party to the conflict; and
(f) has not been sent by a State which is not a Party to the conflict on official duty as a member of its armed forces.
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       The point being is that to be a mercenary you specifically have to have no interest in the cause, be introduced by a non-state actor, and be involved in an ARMED CONFLICT. For this reason, people being paid to protest don't count.

       None of those are proof...

      <p>
       By your logic, I can find articles that offer the same "proof" that Trump collaborated with Russians.

      <p>
       Shit, even the Fox News story says "allegedly" and includes a screenshot of a craigslist ad that a Trump supporter could have manufactured.

       So if you now understand that you exist in a sea of misinformation and disinformation, why side with any one group?  Liberal, conservative alike are being manipulated.  Divide and conquer.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yet you still want to side with a group that wanted to put establishment whore shillary in play.  A second clinton at work getting more state dept people killed over her gun running activities.
      </p>
      <p>
       Those are the people you side with when you blame half of the process on the other half.  Think it through.

       There are laws; county, state, federal, and international, against being a private mercenary.  Just as there are maritime laws against Privateers (paid pirates).  If you read all the way through you see the general is careful not to take a side, equally faulting EXTREME right and left.  As far as the military being mercenaries?  I'm sorry but your ignorance is showing there.

       Even if their video shows evidence of a particular event using paid protesters that doesn't mean any other event has or is using paid protesters.  This is without even bring up the reputation of that source. You may be receiving more of those here, but you're still committing to seem logical fallacies as always: leaves of logic and generalizations.

       First, they are absolutely not a reputable source. Second even if what's on their video is true and shows evidence of paid protesters at a single event, that means nothing about any other given event. If you are using that video to draw conclusions about other events... well, I guess that's just more leaps of logic and generalizations.

      <pre><code>You have no 1st Amendment rights when you’re a mercenary.

      <p>
       Why? Is there any law against mercenaries that I don't know? Are soldiers not also basically mercenaries (getting paid for violence).

       Yes, yes there is. And no- not when you're supporting a nation you are at war with. I promise you, we are at war with someone who is supporting these mercenaries. The beginnings of war. But that doesn't matter. Reddit, you all know who it is.

       I guess this fine upstanding General told our American and Allies about the same thing when going to war with the Axis Powers. Sorry folks...NAzis are marching in America. And in the Police Force. Mayors' offices. And not one shred of proof that any slush fund for paying people to go fight them as they threaten everybody not of the master race. This "General" is a paper tiger. The Alt  right is all of a sudden realizing that peace-loving no longer means "pacifist" and they don't know how to respond but accuse those who have given up peaceful protests to avoid being kettled and arrested en masse while the Nazis HELP subdue them for their cop buddies. Civil war? It started a long time ago. It's just now that the anti fascists are done playing peacenick while the Nazis are allowed to roam the streets with assault rifles and brutalize at will. MErcenaries? Nope. Americans. Doing what Americans do best. Fight against tyrrany.

       Somehow that doesn't sound like opposition to violence. That sounds like "shut the fuck up and stop bitching, or else." That is not an opposition to violence, it's a threat of violence.

       I was making the point that u/decimal9 only showed up to make partisan comments in a sad effort to project division in this sub. Let me remind you, r/conspiracy VET, that we never took sides and we don't give a fuck about puppet trump. R/conspiracy is against all forms of treasonous entities. Not left, not right, not just liberals, not just conservatives.

       Some certainly do and there's nothing wrong with that. Considering that he's our president if even half of what has been reported is true then that would be a pretty big deal. I would have void making giant sweeping generalizations about the population of the subreddit. Besides, you don't have to take sides to call out obvious idiocy in a sitting president.

       You can reject two evils. Far better than siding with the lesser. Thats what has put us in the situation we're in now.

       It doesnt matter if peace loving commies are objectively better than white supremacists when theyre both being manipulated by the same oligarchs that want a war so they can consolidate power.

       Every form of government has been responsible for the deaths of millions of people. Communism redistributes wealth to the common person. White nationalism kills everyone but white people. Explain to me how those two are comparable in any way.

       White nationalism is not a form of government, for one. For two, I never compared the two. Either option is evil. Communism does not redistribute the wealth because in a true communist society there is no wealth. How would there be anything to distribute when profit and property is outlawed? What incentive does one have to work hard and produce when one is guaranteed everything they need will be provided by the government? Fear of death? Yeah, maybe that would work except the ruling class may kill you regardless of your standing with the party just because. Mao and Stalin proved that point millions of times over.

       The device you are browsing reddit on right now would not exist without capitalism. To each according to his need also means there is no reason to do anything beyond your societies basic requirements. Why would someone invest the time and money (well, not money because profit is outlawed) into creating new things when there is little to no reward for doing so?

       No communism is definitely not the best option, I kind of went off on a tangent there and started getting more into my ideals, but I do feel like communism or socialism are needed intermediary steps towards a better system, when it comes to my beliefs there tends to be an anarcho- prefix attached though.

       There is no wealth in communism? Jesus christ that's just straight up stupid. I'm sorry, but it is. Just because the wealth is supposed to be evenly distributed doesn't make the wealth go away.

       You should hold yourself to a higher standard as well. I read your link, and I have many problems with his attribution of death tolls 2nd and 3rd hand to the US. I won't get into why, because I'm sure you can figure it out.

       and that he gives communism a pass on famine saying that it was caused by stupidity but then counts it against capitalism.

       Basically every point you make can be brought against your argument against communism though, which is exactly why I linked the article I did. Neither side can accurately place blame on the other because of so many varied factors.

       The difference here is that you're trying to use your article to prove your point, I'm using mine too show the flaws in using these articles in the manner you are. Both are dishonest, but only one of us is trying to use the article as propaganda.

       Which brings us allllll the way back to the beginning, where you were asked "what makes communism evil?"

       If the root of your argument is "people are evil", I'm left scratching my head wondering why you're not able to see the forest from the trees here.

       Communism is an oppressive system just the same. It's the same centralization of authority to a state, which dictates how I must live my life, express myself, utilize my labour and resources and ultimately how my life may end. You may think they're the exact opposite of each other, but for the common man, it's all the just fascism to us in the end. Democracy isn't amazing, but it's certainly better. It's a more likely middle ground, though now it's being heavily manipulated by extremist parties throughout the western world as well. This is why we must recognize fascism in all forms, and work to avoid it overcoming us peacefully before we have to do it with force.
      </p>

       Mussolini was ultimately a communist, Stalin too. Everyone likes to point at Hitler too as "fascist" the fuck you think the "National Socialist" portion of his Nazi party meant? Not communist? It's all the same!

       I'm not a communist and don't want to be, just putting that out there, I just don't understand everyone's hate for it. Everyone has so obviously been brain washed to accept capitalism as some pure form of economy and don't recognize just how many people suffer every day to make your capitalist life easy.

       Hell, I don't care where they found it, the notion of a Major General in the United States military claiming that mercenaries are not lawful combatants and deserve whatever comes their way at the hands of the people they are attacking? And that bit about how not even the Secession Crisis was this bad?

       They think the US will fall like all the others. Start a civil war so that we start fighting amongst ourselves and rot it out from the inside.

       They forget that the bloodlines that started this great nation still exist. There are those amongst us who see the manipulations, realize exactly what is at stake, and will fight to our dying breaths to prevent the globalist scum from destroying this nation.

       They haven't awoken the bear that is true American patriots, but they are getting close. These types are not involved in these fake conversations on the internet. They aren't the ones at rallies attempting to show that you are on one fringe or the other.

       These are the ones that haven't acted yet, but will, when it goes to far.
      </p>
      <p>
       The powers that be are leading us towards something. They think through chaos they will achieve the instability necessary for the American public to cave on the defense of their remaining sovereignty and national rights.
      </p>
      <p>
       What they underestimate is that there are hundreds of thousands of true patriots hiding beneath the chaos who will simply not allow their country to be taken in the name of corrupt globalist endeavors.
      </p>
      <p>
       Those pulling the strings are in for a scary and bloody awakening if they ever truly tap the true life force of this country.
      </p>
      <p>
       America will not be lost without a fight like those toppled before it. We are something unique. Something different, and their shadowy actions show just how terriefed of us that they are

        What they underestimate is that there are hundreds of thousands of true patriots hiding beneath the chaos who will simply not allow their country to be taken in the name of corrupt globalist endeavors.

      <p>
       Those true patriots have been asleep for a very long time now.  I've heard rumours of their existence before; but I'm wondering why they've allowed the country to go as close to being completely destroyed as it has been, before doing something about it.

       Worship of the military has become tedious for me; if for no other reason than because I know that said attitude is one of the foundational elements of a fascist society.  The Marines are more than sufficiently self-congratulatory themselves as it is; they don't need civilian help.

       Exactly. There are thousands of highly motivated individuals who would love to blow the lid off this whole thing. But, of the thousands of supposedly paid counter-protestors out there, not a single one has been somebody willing to speak up? Not a single one has been somebody from 4chan or the_Donald who wanted to infiltrate the enemy?

       If they're paying hundreds of people, one person could easily post their canceled check with their name blacked out and never be identified. 
The fact that it isn't happening would also explain why you don't see evidence of it.

       We're an opinionated country and there are a lot of young people, both conservative and liberal, who are out of work. I just don't find it hard to believe that there are thousands of young people who are out there protesting of their own accord.

       This is strictly anecdotal, but I have family members whose churches traveled to DC for the march for life, and I couple of dozen people in my population 500 town went for the women's march.

       What if they don't get a check for it because they are salaried?
      </p>
      <p>
       I agree that a lot of it is organic, or simply people being manipulated without there awareness. Once you get all the people there, it only takes a few salaried spooks to turn things violent.
      </p>
      <p>
       I wonder how often it is the spooks bringing the weapons to disperse to their manipulated minds. If they do it with explosives for frame jobs you think sticks and bats wouldn't be a stretch.

       The Left practically invented NGOs, as far as I'm concerned.  Add to that, the amount of evidence I saw on 4chan that the JIDF are absolutely real.  I don't have any difficulty believing this whatsoever.  I'm sure it happens, on both sides.  Occupy Wall Street repeatedly complained about the number of homeless and mentally ill people who the cops flooded them with.

       Agreed. The only reason I haven't been going to protests is because I can't afford to take time off work. Twenty-five bucks an hour would make it a

       Bring a couple hundred to a smaller town to attack a statue.  Create a situation where the people of the town are feeling attacked by left or right, depending on their leanings. Get it into the news, maybe you can inspire the previously quiet residents of the town to get active.

       Honestly, I saw someone post a archived Craiglist ad that was posted "1 minute ago" as evidence that there's paid actors. Obviously they made the ad. Anyone can make any ad at anytime, so what's sad is that the entire argument is made up.. to be able to claim the right to be violent, in response to a true false flag.

       Scott Foval, who was the national field director of Americans United for Change, a 501(c)(4), was filmed by Project Veritas stating  that they sent paid protestors, including mentally ill people, to disrupt Trump rallies. Foval was fired after the tape came out. AUC was a relatively small (between $1 and $10 million) organization that fought Bush then supported Obama. Its first president,
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Woodhouse">
        Brad Woodhouse
       </a>
       was communications director of the DNC from 2009 to 2013 and was president of the infamous Correct the Record PAC in 2016.
       <a href="http://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php/Americans_United_for_Change">
        liberal source
       </a>
       <a href="https://capitalresearch.org/article/americans-united-for-change/">
        conservative source
       </a>
       . 
Although Americans United for Change was ostensibly inactive in the 2016 election and did not file any disclosures, it did receive about a million from
       <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/expends/vendor.php?year=2016&amp;amp;vendor=Americans+United+For+Change">
        reporting entities, including $500,000 from Pelosi.
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       So what does this mean? In decreasing order of confidence:
      </p>
      <p>
       1)We know that politicians openly send staffers and volunteers to their opponents' events to monitor or disrupt.
      </p>
      <p>
       2)It's virtually certain that they are also sending people covertly to monitor their opponents.
      </p>
      <p>
       3)It's highly likely that campaigns send people covertly to non-violently disrupt opponents' events (e.g. shouting questions or insults).
      </p>
      <p>
       4)It's likely that Democrats provided support for the disruption of Trump rallies.
      </p>
      <p>
       5)It's likely that at least some of the Trump rally disruptions were planned by people paid by the DNC.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where I think posts like OP's go wrong is when they extrapolate from Trump rallies to all protests. There's a decades long history of militant leftist activism with a long history of opposing and being opposed by Democrats as well as Republicans. The same groups (and some of the same people) who were fighting the right in Charlottesville were smashing Starbucks in Seattle back in 1999.

       Any edited video by O'Keefe needs to be taken with a giant grain of sand.  He is known to for unscrupulous editing and has gotten people fired in the past, only for them to come out clean in later lawsuits.

       How is only taking about the person relevant in the conversation a "mistake"?   If the person I responded to was using other media as a source, the credibility of them would be relevant, but they were not. So its not.

       Its whataboutism is that it is.  Its misleading the discussion away from O'Keefe being caught as woefully misrepresenting people with his recordings and trying to change the narrative to "Pretty much every video has an agenda" which isn't the point. The point is that O'Keefe has been caught lying and misrepresenting people in videos in the past and should not be taken as a creditable source.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just like your post obviously have an agenda of blurring the discussion into one about how everyone edits their videos in an effort to make O'Keefe's major infractions seem like something that everyone does.

       Haha nice theory, Watson, but no, it's actually you who is obfuscating the facts.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your own link states that the lawsuit he settled on was "filed on the assertion that O'Keefe broke a state law prohibiting the surreptitious recording of someone's voice and image."
      </p>
      <p>
       The case was about secret recording, it has nothing to do about what was on the tape and thus nothing about misrepresenting people.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        A report in 2010 by the office of the California attorney general said that O'Keefe and Giles were given immunity from prosecution when they agreed to provide complete and unedited copies of videos made in Los Angeles, San Bernardino and National City.
       </p>
       <p>
        ACORN employees "may be able to bring a private suit against O'Keefe and Giles for recording a confidential conversation," according to the report, completed while now-Gov. Jerry Brown was attorney general. Brown had been asked to investigate by then-Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger.
       </p>
       <p>
        Among O'Keefe's deceptions, the report said, was that in the videos he is shown wearing "stereotypical 1970s pimp garb" but that when he visited the ACORN offices, he was wearing a suit and tie.

       The only reason he wasn't prosecuted for the ACORN incident was because there was deal made.

       It has such comments as
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        O’Keefe stated he was out to make a point and to damage ACORN and therefore did not act as a
journalist objectively reporting a story. The video releases were heavily edited to feature only
the worst or most inappropriate statements of the various ACORN employees and to omit some
of the most salient statements by O’Keefe and Giles. Each of the ACORN employees recorded
in California was a low level employee whose job was to help the needy individuals who walked in the door seeking assistance. Giles and O’Keefe lied to engender compassion, but then edited
their statements from the released videos. Would it have been best had each ACORN employee
simply refused to deal with the couple and shown them the door when their story came out? Of
course.

       innocuous. It's clear he's talking about using a mentally ill or willing volunteer to disrupt something. Best case scenario, he's bullshitting. This is unlike the ACORN scenario where the speakers are portrayed as talking to a more sympathetic interrogator than the video displays.

       And I can't listen to the complete recordings, because Veritas hasn't released anything unedited.  If it was so damning of a conversation why won't O'Keefe just release the unedited footage and slam the door on people like me questioning him? Why does the footage you linked clip to the middle of a conversation about paying mentally ill people to do stuff?  Maybe the question was literally "hey do you pay mentally ill people to help do shit." and he just answered in a way that seems suspect given the context of the other shit O'Keefe clipped next to it.
      </p>
      <p>
       If O'Keefe was really wanting to show journalism and not just push whatever he decided was his narrative in the video, he would be willing to release unedited footage.

       He is also implying that paid protesters are violent, and that the phenomenon can only exist on the left side of the ideological spectrum. It's also a veiled threat and call to violence based on nothing but generalizations and speculation, zero sources, no examples. Who is the 'silent majority' being referred to here.

       Overall, this post reads like some old angry white guy yelling at his television about 'libtards'.

       If there is a silent majority, hopefully they are free thinkers, not alarmist ideologues like this lunatic.

       Can't comment on this $25hr protester post but I can attest to knowing that Unions hire people to protest on behalf of their workers. They pay $15/hr to hold a sign and protest. This is in SO Cal btw.
      </p>
      <p>
       25hr seems a little high. Unless you're expected to get physical with the opposition?

       My wife got a pair of paid union protesters arrested once.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was a man and woman outside a drugstore open during a partial remodel. Apparently, the union had lost the bid for that work.
      </p>
      <p>
       They were getting in between people and the door and telling them it was "Not safe to go inside." It was clearly meant to be intimidating/threatening/scary.
      </p>
      <p>
       As soon as they said that to my wife, she took it seriously. They started stammering about "shoddy workmanship" and "non OSHA illegal labor."
      </p>
      <p>
       My wife called the police.
      </p>
      <p>
       When the police showed up they tried to weasel out of it, claimed they hadn't said that, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       The officer asked a few people exiting the store what was said to them, and upon confirming my wife's story, arrested the couple.
      </p>
      <p>
       As they were being cuffed and stuffed, and the pickup they lived out of towed (the store did not allow it to remain in their parking lot), they started whining about how it wasn't their fault.
      </p>
      <p>
       They said how they
       <em>
        needed
       </em>
       the $15/hour they were getting paid, and how they had driven 100 miles to get the job.
      </p>
      <p>
       The officer pointed out that they should STFU, because they were implicating themselves for more charges. He said they were lucky, he had to cite the protesters they were replacing in the hospital, after they had gotten beaten badly pulling the same bullshit 3 days before.
      </p>
      <p>
       I felt really bad for the couple, they were broke and desperate, too bad they chose to be paid thugs.

       Perhaps they had to sign a confidentiality contract so they aren't allowed to leak anything without severe legal action against them. Then again - anonymity and whatnot; you'd think there would be something.

       Sorry, but there's no way thousands of supposed $25/hr protestors (many of which are drug addicts and homeless, according to conservative groups) would be more tight-lipped.

       Is this a real thing?  Idgaf about protesting, politics, liberals or violence but I'd take $25/hr to stand with a sign.  Furthermore, I'd probably just sign up, show up, and go home.  I just want $25/hr, I don't have a job at the moment.

       Kind of off topic but my favorite is when Jen Bush had to pay people to show up to his primary campaign events. And I think he got 1 delegate out of Iowa even though he had less than ten percent of the vote.

       Up until WWI the American Civil War was the biggest, nastiest, and bloodiest war of any kind that had ever taken place in recorded history. Largest number of deaths and injuries, too. At least that's what they old us in the History Class I attended in high school.

       The notorious Golden Horde consisted of about 130,000 armed and mounted men. A huge, highly mobile and overwhelming force in it's day but not as huge as you seem to suspect. You also have to take the advances in lethal weaponry and military tactics into consideration as well.

       Gettysburg was as devastating and murderous a battle as Waterloo where once again numerous countries were involved. There's certainly no other "civil wars", not the English Civil War, or French or American revolutions which were essentially civil conflicts, that even begin to be comparable with the numbers involved in the US Civil War.

       The periodic loss of power and inevitable fall of Chinese dynasties and the chaos that ensued before another one arose is really another topic in and of itself.
      </p>
      <p>
       In addition to Mandarin and Cantonese there are over 500 different dialects of Chinese spoken, many of which are completely unintelligible to each other. On the flip side, they all use the same written but not spoken words for the ideographs they use to write and can communicate that way provided that they know how to write. Customs also vary greatly from place to place and they always have.

       Nope. France lost about 550k during the invasion and Russia 200k, for a total of ~750k, which makes it just a tad higher than the american civil war at 350k+250k=600k.

       In terms of combat deaths and casualties in battle I think the Civil War's numbers were actually much worse.
      </p>
      <p>
       In terms of death due to starvation and exposure due to the Russian "Scorched Earth" tactics and fierce winter conditions Napoleon's armies were completely unprepared for, I think it's fair to say that those more than the few major battles Napoleon fought against the Russian army were what actually destroyed and decimated the large force that he invaded with.

       There were only minor skirmishes and (iirc) one major battle, that the french won, during the campaign and Moscow was taken with little resistance. However even Moscow was not exempt the Tsar's will and was torched, forcing the french to march back again during the russian autumn and winter.

       I was actually just looking at the French losses, not total,  and had taken the soldier total of the civil war,  so both weren't quite correct I admit now that I'm looking back on it.

       My mistake. I thought
       <em>
        only
       </em>
       600k died in the civil war, and I included both sides for my Napoleon comment, the Russians lost 210k so it's 620&lt;610 I spose. Thanks for the info though!

       No evidence of this, ie people getting paid to start riots, unless we are talking about police. And incase anyone forgets, there are actual professional activists. They run or are a part organizations that take donations to push for certain causes and make enough money to live and are then able to spend all their time working as activists.

       I am getting really fucking sick of the over blown idea of how many attacks that supposedly happen. Are we counting every angry fist thrown? There were a lot of those in the 1960's as well. Driving a fucking car into a crowd is not comparable to some fist fights that break out from frustration and anger. Everything is propaganda today, especially the violence.

       Are you dumb? the 1860s was when the civil war was being fought. And even if you meant to say the 1850s, in the run up to the civil war, your statement would still be a blatant lie, or your just extremely ignorant.

       These antifa and "alt-righters" are led by agent provocteaurs that are using the divide and conquer strategy. Why do you think the media is always showing their "protests" on tv? They are trying to get normal people in the "silent majority" to pick sides.. It is so obvious who is behind this its almost ridiculous that most of you people cant see what is going on here.

       Dude I already told you, the media is always covering these altercations b/w "antifa" and "Alt-righters" (As the media likes to call them).. If they didn't pay no attention to them then no one would even care about 'picking a side'.. That is all I am saying. Why are you so argumentative?

       Pigs flying i imagine. The Democrats won't take back both chambers while trumps in office, and the Republicans won't attack their own as long as their constituents don't hate him. It would be political suicide. He's doing a great job getting their policies in place. He's playing his bit perfectly. I bet the entire administration is in on it.

       So do you have, like, a copy of the job application or something? Cause I've been doing this shit for free and if someone's willing to foot the bill for gas money, poster board, and big permanent markers sign me the fuck up.

       Seriously though what even is this? No one is getting paid to protest. This reads like something from

       And no bullshit. I'd counter protest the shit out of a motherfucker for $25 a hour. Fuck, I'd put in overtime. Maybe it's taken me 30 years to admit this but the game is rigged and no amount protesting or internet bitching will change that. I for one will be playing for me and mine from here on out. Hell, maybe life has finally beat me up. Maybe I'm giving in. But the richer get richer and I continue to scrap by.

       Don't for get the words of Gen Smedley Butler, 2-time Metal of Honor winner.
      </p>
      <p>
       I spent 33 years and four months in active military service and during that period I spent most of my time as a high class muscle man for Big Business, for Wall Street and the bankers. In short, I was a racketeer, a gangster for capitalism. I helped make Mexico and especially Tampico safe for American oil interests in 1914. I helped make Haiti and Cuba a decent place for the National City Bank boys to collect revenues in. I helped in the raping of half a dozen Central American republics for the benefit of Wall Street. I helped purify Nicaragua for the International Banking House of Brown Brothers in 1902–1912. I brought light to the Dominican Republic for the American sugar interests in 1916. I helped make Honduras right for the American fruit companies in 1903. In China in 1927 I helped see to it that Standard Oil went on its way unmolested. Looking back on it, I might have given Al Capone a few hints. The best he could do was to operate his racket in three districts. I operated on three continents.

       A lot of shills try to put out "cambridge analytica" as an equivalent to liberal astroturfing, CTR, shareblue, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not.
      </p>
      <p>
       Cambridge analytica is a market research company. They research voters, demographics, and help design effective messages as well as look for the best places to do outreach. Now it uses some invasive privacy methods of course, and that's a valid debate, but it's no where near to the CTR/Shareblue shit.

Not a single one has been somebody from 4chan or the_Donald who wanted to infiltrate the enemy?
