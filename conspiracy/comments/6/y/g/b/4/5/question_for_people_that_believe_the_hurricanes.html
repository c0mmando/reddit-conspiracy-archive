<p>It is openly admitted that HAARP, which is just a large antenna array with a shit ton of power, can focus on and heat up (transfer energy to) a portion of the atmosphere. All storm are the result of hot air colliding with cold air. The bigger the difference the stronger the storm. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not an expert, but it&#39;s not like they&#39;re conjuring up a storm from sunny weather. The energy was already there, a storm was already brewing. All they&#39;d have to do is to focus and enhance it. If the technology works the way they want it to work, they could simply add additional moisture by either heating up additional ocean water (probably rather energy intensive, but not impossible) or by redirecting moist air from other parts of the world to add to the storm (probably the better option).</p>

<p>That&#39;s just speculation, obviously, but I can see several ways in which they could affect a storm in such a way as to strengthen or weaken it, without needing to match the energy throughput of the storm itself.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think so. It would be more like affecting a freight train by moving the tracks. It still requires work but most of the energy required is compensated through planning and an effective workflow.</p>

<p>You don&#39;t have to &quot;push&quot; the storm if you can make it fall along a path of least resistance to where you want it to be. The idea behind HAARP (as I understand it) is that they can use radio waves that bounce between the Earth&#39;s crust and the ionosphere and send a targeted positive interference to very specific locations around the world, and can thereby produce artificial low-pressure zones wherever they want. Do that well and you can guide a storm cell like you&#39;d guide a donkey with a carrot on a stick. That&#39;s actually not a bad metaphor either because it illustrates that it doesn&#39;t require a lot of energy at all to move a donkey unless you try to push it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mean there&#39;s still a tremendous amount of power in even regular pressure systems, so it&#39;s not like that&#39;s easy to do. You also have to assume meteorologists are perfectly able to predict the weather (since you need to control this thing so finely to manipulate events like this) and choose not to to maintain the illusion that we don&#39;t have control over this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The U.S. government costs itself billions of dollars in a lot of things. And here&#39;s another bit of information. You&#39;re paying for it. &quot;The government&quot; in the sense of the people who run it aren&#39;t paying a dime. They&#39;re making money with it. From you. (I&#39;m saying you because I&#39;m not American, I have the same problem where I&#39;m from, don&#39;t worry). So much for the point of motive.</p>

<p>It&#39;s certainly true that H.A.A.R.P uses tons of energy (I can&#39;t seem to find a source, but I remember reading an article a while ago in which they compared it to something like the monthly energy consumption of a city like Chicago for a single experiment, something like that), just because of the scale of it. But that&#39;s not any kind of impossible amount, and I don&#39;t see why it&#39;d need to be.</p>

<p>It&#39;s the idea of interference. It&#39;d be like setting up several radio towers which all sent out a static vibration (radio wave) and tuned it so that the resulting combination of signals would resonate and interfere with each other, effectively amplifying each other to several orders of magnitude greater amplitudes at specific locations.</p>

<p>Did you see the link I added in the previous comment? It shows the effects that are possible with targeted interference very well and shows it&#39;s really not a problem of energy but phase control. Precision is the much bigger stumbling block, but hey, we&#39;re dealing with hurricanes the size of states here, not trying to water a single tomato plant in the desert.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You also have to assume meteorologists are perfectly able to predict the weather (since you need to control this thing so finely to manipulate events like this)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t see any reason to assume this. they can predict the likelyhood of storms and hurricanes and all that pretty accurately weeks in advance sometimes; certainly days. And why would you have to manipulate the cell so finely? You want it to drift towards Houston from the South? Set a low-pressure node north of the storm and incrementally pull it over to Houston. Correct as you go.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>and choose not to to maintain the illusion that we don&#39;t have control over this.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, they barely do maintain the illusion, as you can see in us discussing the ideas and concepts behind it. You can see it in satellite imagery. There are some who claim it&#39;s detectable in the clouds whenever they take on that distinctive wave-pattern, although I&#39;m not convinced that&#39;s not a natural pattern.</p>

<p>It&#39;s the same kind of argument as the one that&#39;s so often applied to the idea of secrecy and conspiracy when they say &quot;It could never remain a secret, somebody would talk!&quot;, to which I say &quot;Yeah, no shit. They&#39;re called whistleblowers.&quot; </p>

<p>It&#39;s not that the information ain&#39;t there, it&#39;s that people don&#39;t want to see it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>HAARP puts out megawatts or gigawatts depending on what it&#39;s turned to. It&#39;s a lot for a single experiment but it&#39;s negligible compared to the amount of energy in storm systems or even regular pressure systems. I think we agree there, because I also agree it&#39;s not unreasonable to power something like HAARP on demand. I just don&#39;t agree it&#39;s able to be used in the way people theorize.</p>

<p>I would be interested in the math on how HF radio interference can actually be used to affect weather patterns. I&#39;ve never seen any convincing evidence of this being done. Surely someone could look at all their <a href="http://www.gi.alaska.edu/haarp/publications-about-haarp-research-1990-2010">publicly available activity and research</a> and figure out how it is being done.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>All I&#39;m saying is that it&#39;s conceivable and theoretically possible. Your concerns and objections about power consumptions are certainly valid and reasonable, though to my mind not strong enough to discount the idea. I&#39;m also not convinced enough that it is going on to state it as a fact, but I do have a strong suspicion it&#39;s true.</p>

<p>As to the acoustic levitation, that was merely meant as an illustration that a phasing matrix and interference patterns can be used to manipulate objects and particles. It&#39;s meant more as an analogy than as an explanation. For one, the effect shown in the video is produced using a widely different frequency band and is therefore very different in both energy consumption and the kind of particle that it will be able to manipulate.</p>

<p>My hunch is that if it&#39;s real it is simply energizing the movement of air particles in specific regions enough to cause a slight increase in local temperatures which in turn result in zone of relatively low pressure. But it seems I&#39;m starting to repeat myself.</p>

<p>You may be right and it isn&#39;t feasible. I may be right (though I hope not) and it&#39;s already going on.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am sorry to have upset you.</p>

<p>Just consider the orders of magnitude involved here. A hurricane is churning 100+TW of power, way more than the entire world&#39;s electricity production. A MOAB releases <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GBU-43/B_MOAB">46 GJ</a> or less than half of a milisecond of the hurricane&#39;s power.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve said it elsewhere but this is seriously like trying to stop a freight train by pointing a water gun or a hair dryer at it.</p>

<p>You are welcome to provide evidence of explosives actually being used to stop hurricanes.</p>

The premise was that somehow (not clearly explained) the seeding could weaken the updraft that feeds a tornado or trigger cold downdrafts that would extinguish them “as a stiff breeze extinguishes a candle”.</a></p>

<p>Can&#39;t this be done at a much larger scale? (And sorry for using WaPo, I don&#39;t really like their site either)</p>

<p>Source...? I don&#39;t think any of this works the way you think it does. And how much dry ice do you think you need for a storm that is 100 miles across compared to a tornado?</p>

<blockquote>

<p>You and all the aid workers helping prepare for the incoming storm, the government officials ordering mandatory evacuations, all the disaster preparedness campaigns, people who set building codes and design stormwalls and levees to help protect against storms... there&#39;s a lot that we do to try to prepare for these events.</p>

<p>I do understand your frustration. I have had family and friends endangered by hurricanes before (and right now) too.</p>

<p>Can you work through your calculations on this? If it were true I would be very interested in the math. Hurricanes fascinate me ever since I had a project on them in grade school.

    <div class="md"><p>As I came up with it, I just figure the storm would be circling clockwise and would be expended portion by portion, with each consecutive blasts. An object at rest stays at rest and an object in motion stays in motion with the same speed and in the same direction unless acted upon by an unbalanced force. This unbalancing force would be created by consecutive concussions within the giant radius of the weather pattern. Think of the plan they had set for the movie &#39;The Core&#39; (I know its just a movie and isn&#39;t true yada, yada, yada)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The amount of power/energy involved matters. Obviously 15 firecrackers won&#39;t do it; not enough energy. Do you have any calculations estimating 15 MOABs have enough?</p>

<p>Can you estimate how much energy is needed to literally stop a hurricane&#39;s rotation in its tracks? Because based on the power involved (on the order of 100 TW) the hurricane churns through more energy than all 15 MOABs would have in a time scale measured in microseconds.
Every day an average hurricane releases <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20170701035351/http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/tcfaq/D7.html">5*10<sup>19</sup> J</a>, which is the energy of <a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=(5E19+J">800,000 of the bombs dropped on Hiroshima</a>%2F(energy+in+the+hiroshima+bomb)).</p>

<p>Not to mention the other issues with this, like that you&#39;re not trying to stop a solid object that&#39;s rotating here; the rest of the storm dozens of miles away from the explosions will be unaffected. And the overall pressure systems that led to its formation would still exist, and... there&#39;s a lot behind a hurricane.</p>

<p>By my estimates we would have to drop many nuclear weapons into Irma at the same time to even notice any effect... and then we would have a hurricane carrying fallout and I don&#39;t even want to think about how that would work.</p>

<p>15 Moabs wont do shit to that. An object in motion stays in motion, and in this is like trying to stop an 80mph tank with a fire sparkler. It doesn&#39;t matter what pattern you try to ignite those sparklers in, it&#39;s not stopping that tank.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, that is interesting, and i have seen the videos.  However, I would like to see radar data from past hurricanes, or hear from meteorologists... so far i have only seen this discussed by random people, that seem biased towards a conspiracy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not biased my dad use to work for NASA and worked on manipulating weather but he said they couldn&#39;t do it it wasn&#39;t until I watched the radar video (there are radar videos) that I saw the straight lines from them pushing the storm and holding it over Houston </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I didn&#39;t necessarily mean you, i meant the people that are presenting the radar imagery, and the theory.  I would like to see data from previous hurricanes, and/or input from a meteorologist.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The military has documented use of geoengineering like haarp. Weather modification has been being used to manipulate the weather and from my understanding to be used as a weapon, for example causing a storm in a place so the enemy cant get their jets off the ground etc. Any new technology the military is using is always gonna be classified. But i also read that when they test in certain areas it gets picked up by the jet stream therefore affecting the weather in different areas.</p>
