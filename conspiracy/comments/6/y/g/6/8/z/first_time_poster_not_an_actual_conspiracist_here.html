        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I just read your sub rules, and I don&#39;t think I&#39;m breaking any of them, given the flexibility of &quot;depending on the context.&quot; If I break any rules, please let me know, and I&#39;ll edit it. I&#39;m not here to accuse any users of anything, just ask peoples&#39; opinion of a possibility. It may also sound like I&#39;m admonishing Donald Trump voters, but I&#39;m not trying to. Pls just stick till the end.    </p>

<p>I know it&#39;s not popular in many places, but it seems somewhat safe to say that Russia mettled in the US Presidential election. Even if you aren&#39;t convinced that DT himself was involved, our intelligence agencies are in agreement that Russia had designs, and implemented them around the time of the election. I&#39;m not here to attack DT, or Russia, or push that scenario. This is just background, that at least multiples of our top intelligence agencies are in agreement about their mettling. My speculation about another conspiracy coming in just a moment.   </p>

<p>And to bolster my forthcoming theory, let&#39;s assume that there are in fact many people outside of the US that were paid to create &quot;fake news&quot; targeted at US citizens, with the intent of swaying the public in their vote. This isn&#39;t your standard, sloppy, misleading US news. Fake news is supposed to be almost entirely wrong, originating from URL&#39;s meant to seem reminiscent of large US publications, written to elicit an emotional response, and help form opinions. Not the people who <em>finance</em> it, but at least the people who are paid to <em>create</em> it, even admit what they&#39;re doing. There&#39;s small geographical <em>economies</em> built around it, in places like Macedonia, Romania, and Russia. We&#39;ve known about it since well before this election, so believing in its existence shouldn&#39;t be a matter of political affiliation.   </p>

<p>Conspiracy:  </p>

<p>This mettling was driven primarily by creation of fake news publication, and then spread via social media, and also driven by online forum discussion, encouraging strife among US social and political issues. It was essentially meant to divide. </p>

<p>Much more recently, I&#39;ve been seeing a sudden influx of supposedly Liberal users on reddit, espousing violent reaction and consequences for Conservatives. It&#39;s not often at all, but I have seen a small trend emerge. I understand that there exists an often violent group called Antifa, who are common at rallies and protests. But I&#39;ve seen a sudden influx of new accounts suggesting violence, in subs where I didn&#39;t see it before. I&#39;m sure some conservatives will say that Liberals were already, or always were, violent. But this is my experience, and I&#39;m seeing random, sparse, new users, making comments involving violence, such as this <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/AgainstHateSubreddits/comments/6ycp6g/the_donald_posting_fascist_propaganda_from_pol/dmmw13l/?context=3">one</a> .    </p>

<p>I also had a PM thread with someone claiming to be black, who claimed that they welcome the death of all white people, and so on. I know there&#39;s actual people like this in every race, but it was as though he was intentionally trying to <em>make</em> me hate him. It seemed forced. </p>

<p>My point is, would it not be possible, or even likely, that a group conspiring to create a divide in US culture and politics, who is already found by our intelligence agencies to have influenced opinion this year, would then begin working on the other side of the parties to do the same? How better to destabilize a country, than to turn one side against the other? If they did it to one political group, we liberals could stand back and throw stones. But why would these people not then try to seep into <em>both</em> discussions, trying to normalize the idea of violence and hate, to fully revile us against each other? It almost seems unlikely that they&#39;d only do it to one side.   </p>

<p>This is my random impression of a possible conspiracy. Is an outside force compelling us to drive further and further away from each other? Are we an easier target if we&#39;re a nation divided? Is an international anonymous message board the perfect place to sew threads of hate and influence and misdirection?    </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry, man. The Russia thing just doesn&#39;t much hunt. Frankly, even if they did hack the DNC, I appreciate knowing what a horribly corrupt organization it is, and knowing how they stole the nomination from Sanders, and how the media is a bunch of bootlicking biased hacks. </p>

<p>As for the State Dept. leaks or hacks, if you think Russia&#39;s the only country that&#39;s got all that stuff, you&#39;re kidding yourself. The FBI report shows that the State Dept. internet security was a sieve. And, if she was using a private server, the NSA has all her shit and god only knows who else.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s been so proof presented that Russia meddled, nor that they are running operations to exacerbate and exploit racial tensions in the United States. However, I wouldn&#39;t put either past Putin after the Yeltsin debacle, hatred/fear of Hillary, love of Trump, revenge for Panama Papers, the chance to both expose a US political party and make the country appear weak, incompetent, and generally insane. Plus the fact that every capable country hacks the rest probably every day. Revenge for years of the US messing with foreign elections. US support for Ukraine, a country currently fighting a war against Russia. A chance to fracture nato. Help an inexperienced, divisive and essentially inept man to become president. Oil and natural gas pipelines. Kill sanctions. Take advantage of an electorate detached from reality and plugged into an online world of disinformation and confirmation bias. History with active measures campaigns, espionage, using the mob/oligarchs/third parties to carry out state business the state doesn&#39;t want tied back to itself, Gerasimov Doctrine, <em>Foundations of Geopolitics</em>. I could go on. </p>

<p>Funny you used &quot;Comey&#39;s own statements&quot; earlier as proof that Russia didn&#39;t meddle, this would be the same guy who said &quot;there should be no fuzz on this whatsoever.&quot; </p>

<p>At it&#39;s core it&#39;s an assessment, you can believe it or not. There&#39;s too many obvious motives and objectives for me to simply disregard such an assessment, though. It makes sense <em>and</em> really isn&#39;t much of a big deal. I had no problem with the DNC being exposed.</p>

<p>For someone who has said &quot;hate isn&#39;t bad&quot; on this post, I&#39;m guessing that even if there&#39;s a Russian intel op to propel and exploit racial tensions in the US, that&#39;s alright with you. Am I accurate?</p>

<p>More than a nationalist,  I am patriotic to my homeland,  not just as a nation but more than that.    To be patriotic to that is to be ever vigilant to any corruption to the political system,  to demand transparency and the rule of law.    To be the kind of nationalist that tolerates the level of corruption that has been in place now for many decades is treason as far as I am concerned.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah,  I suppose you are supposed to suck it up.    After all we are sucking up to Citizens United where foreign based corporations have personhood/citizenship here and are free to bribe our politicians and pick our presidents and control both main parties,  Democrat and Republican.    If you don&#39;t care about those corporations doing it to you,  which are bigger than most countries,  then why start whining now?</p>

<p>Also,  Isreal has been known to be controlling our elections for decades.   Where were you then?</p>

<p>If you only got excited when Russia was falsely accused,  I don&#39;t trust you.    Russia is not the reason we have Trump.    That is the stupidest idea I ever heard,  and 99% of the &quot;evidence&quot; given for that is so fucking bogus that intelligent people have taken on new attack tactics.    I hate Trump as much as the next guy,   because hypocrisy among other things.    The Russia hate is even more hypocritical than Trump.    That is pretty damn hypocritical.</p>

<p>There is solid evidence Russia meddled in the U.S. Election, and</p>

support long time political propaganda narratives at play in U.S Politics, such as: </p>

<p>Liberals are all god hating atheists, but are now also all 
&quot;leftists,&quot; and a violent bunch of &quot;thugs&quot; who have one goal beating up those lovely white nationalists, U.S. Nazis, separatists, and fundamental Christians who do want this nation to be a theocracy.  now  all called, alt-right</p>

<p>African Americans, always called, black and blacks, in conservative media hate white people. </p>
