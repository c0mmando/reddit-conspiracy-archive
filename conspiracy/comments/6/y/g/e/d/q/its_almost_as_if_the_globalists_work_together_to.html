       Because actual marxism is a relatively coherent ideology that is incompatible with 'their' interests. They don't want us thinking like that.
       <br/>
       And then Cultural marxism is a made up thing that has no meaning. what is it? identity politics? is there an economic policy?
       <br/>
       You're suggesting that past socialist governments have been brutal and authoritarian. Many marxists would agree.

       Personally, I don't love the term "cultural marxism," either. Its better to focus on the sorts of policies that they seem to support, in my opinion. This includes mass immigration, globalization, identity politics and censorship in the name of feelings, among others. I actually think these policies are perfectly in line with their interests, especially if they are complicit in the attempt at forming a one world government. I think that Communism is the perfect vehicle for that implementation, but, as usual, I don't think it would turn out like most supporters of Communism would hope that it would.

       You're right, it won't. We'll likely see the new world order manifest itself in a global economy strictly regulated by international trade laws enforced by subservient, highly centralized governments that they themselves strictly regulate their economies to maintain corporate castes controlled by the financial institutions that rule from the top down.
      </p>
      <p>
       Wait, that's what we have now. Guys, they don't want you to swallow the pill of a Marxist International government, they want you to be too distracted to realize that they already have one.

       I don't think we're in disagreement here. I realize that we already have one, but its more of a proto-Marxist international government and I worry that its only going to get worse until we have a defacto One World Communist government, unless we somehow stop that from happening.

       No there are fewer and fewer people that are prepared to direct their efforts towards preventing it from happening because they're caught up on one "ism" or another. Their beliefs about each other will drive them to claw at each other like starving dogs forced to fight to the death for the sport and entertainment of sociopaths.

       Haha you are very pessimistic! I can't say I blame you, I have to try pretty hard to remain optimistic. I think there is a small chance that we will eventually become a Star Trek-like civilization, but I do think its more likely that we will eventually become helpless slaves to a totalitarian one world government that is too powerful to ever overthrow. Who knows what will happen? My biggest regret is that I wont be around to find out.

       Sometimes it seems as if everyone here just cannot frame a "default explanation". Or maybe you do and you just skip over the work of explaining why that default would explain what you are talking about.

      <p>
       The "default explanation" is NOT that globalists take over corporations.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is that the owners and key managers of large corporations often come from similar backgrounds (like Harvard Business School), and their work requires them to interact with each other and many high-placed non-corporate key players (politicians and non-profiteers), and eventually all these players naturally tend to think and talk and act in similar ways.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now your job as conspiracy theorist is to show how this "default explanation" - simple, straightforward, logical - cannot be the case.

       I don't think your explanation necessarily precludes the OP's. What you said can be true, and they can also cooperate in anti-competitive ways in order to benefit themselves to the highest possible degree. That would include globalist policies, cheap labor, etc.

       That's right. The two versions don't preclude each other.
      </p>
      <p>
       But one is clearly a conspiracy, and belongs here. The other one is just some branch of sociology - how do humans naturally behave in given social settings.

      <p>
       I'm just asking everybody to focus on a real conspiracy. Take 9-11. There is a "default explanation" for that phenomenon, but we don't even have to try to disprove it by now. It's just a ridiculous claim (by our government) on its face.
      </p>

       I cannot consider the "default explanation" of extreme corporatism, with its many faults, as a ridiculous claim.

       I think that the "to fracture and destroy the indigenous population of a country" is the conspiracy part. Most people probably don't think that they are the driving force behind mass immigration and things like that, just that they support those policies.

       Just to give some additional context in this dialog, permit me to include a rather long snippet from a post I wrote recently on Postmodernism:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        We can all, left and right, see that the end-point of industrialization and computerization is a world in which all the classic economic problems get solved. Who will benefit from that?
The left wants that near-future stage to benefit absolutely everyone in the world. That would mean necessarily breaking down the divisions between the technocratically gifted populations (like white euro males, but also other demographics), and everyone else (like poor brown-skinned people who recently got running water). So their strategy appears to be operating on many levels. Lots of propaganda aimed at leveling the perceptions about the different types of people to make them feel equal; actually encouraging large scale migration so that each country has a mix of people and cannot be homogeneous; large scale infusions of first world capital into the third world areas (by carbon exchange for one thing); efforts to unify economic interchange to facilitate eventual blurring and removal of national boundaries. All these actions are being pushed in postmodern ways.
What does the right want to do? Well I think that's pretty much up in the air. Mostly, I think the right wants to twist postmodernism into a sort of "magic" that retains the ancient roots of our species' unique abilities. A certain amount of inequality is likely built in to that vision.

       Good post. Although I was a bit disappointed with your analysis of what the right wants to do. I think its less about what the right wants to do, and more about how the right sees reality and what measures are practical and rational based on that reality.

       What the right "sees" is a stance, not a platform.
      </p>
      <p>
       The age-old criticism of right-leaning politics is that when they are in power, it's a policy to stand still or roll back. When the left is in power, the policy of the right is to obstruct.

       I do think that the Overton Window is moving fast, but I also think that the further it goes, the greater the pushback will be and that the pendulum will eventually swing back the other way due to this pushback. I don't think the right will really need magic to shape the future. At least I hope this is the case.

       The right only want smaller federal government, less taxes, more privacy rights, states being in charge of their own laws, and the freedom to work and live with the absolute minimum government intervention and control as possible.

       Just to get some stupid list - you have to read this one from bottom up:

       Here's an example of what kind of priorities I suspect all these corporate drone factories would foster:

       Any corporate owner or board would be crazy to exclude these kinds of professional business leaders. They're trained to build multi-million dollars of profit.

       Libertarian socialism is a real thing and there is no reason that society could not be organized in such a manner, especially paired with democratic organization along the lines of participatory politics (parpolity). Well, no reason but for the objections of the capitalist class and scores of wannabe hopefuls certain that they'll be the next millionaire.

       People like you are ironically responsible for people like me seeing the appeal to gulags. I've been attempting to educate and discuss socialism til I'm hoarse and yet you persist with bullshit like this indicating just grievous misconceptions as to even the most basic aspects of socialism. What else is there to be done when dummies defend a feudal state of affairs and dig their heads into the sand when their ignorance is brought to light?

       Socialism is a wide range of economic and political ideologies. What you're doing here is equating socialism with Marxism-Leninism, which is a
       <em>
        specific ideological implementation
       </em>
       of socialism, which for
       <em>
        very specific reasons
       </em>
       advocated its implementation via a single party revolutionary vanguard and the collectivization of the means of production under a centralized state bureaucracy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Try opening up a book for once or at the very fucking least the wiki on anarcho-syndicalism and
       <em>
        try
       </em>

       I hope you realize your ideal system would get you murdered as soon as you went to the wrong side of town, which is now the whole town, possessing something expensive. You'll be dead and looted in minutes and your killer will just mumble some bullshit about feeling threatened.

       And how exactly did socialism ever kill anybody with it's "communal aspects"? I've heard of marxist-lenninist imperial state capitalism killing people with autocracy, but I've never seen literal socialism, on it's own, hurt a fly.

       Yeah. Socialism is the democratic control of resources and workplaces by those using them, and AFAIK that has never existed on a national scale.

       Fairness ain't that subjective. Most people agree having some people born into hardship while others are born into lavish luxury and not required to work is pretty unfair.

       If you read Bastiat, Hayek, Hobbes, Locke, etc, and then add that to what the founders in the US did, the major progress for man in political philosophy seems to be recognizing those in power (be it a King or parliament/etc) begin to abuse it and see themselves as unaccountable after a period. It's happened since the dawn of man.

       Has government done good? Sure, but at what cost?

       I just turned 39 and my ideal world is one where there is no government. All community projects are handled via a kickstarter like mechanism and any "voting" is done on blockchain so there is a shared, public ledger.

       Oh you mean like the hundreds of years of slowly implemented laws which drove the peasants from their lands, to which they had as much right to use as their lords, as well as the enclosure of, privatization and eventual sale of all their communal property, culminating in the creation of an entire class of people dispossessed of the very means to survive unless they "choose" to make sale of their labor? You know, the hundreds of years of such which saw the eventual creation of what is known as the proletariat?

       Capitalism has never not relied on slavery, even in the sanitized modern world the USA puts Stalin's gulags to shame. Running the whole economy for the sake of profit and allowing power to be totally liquid and untraceable through currency rots society to it's core.

       Capitalism may be non-aggression to you, but the capitalism that exists is all about subjugation, oppression and imperialism.

       And me being short cash is your problem, unless you live alone in the woods. The fact that I come from a family with no magical imaginary paper points means I'm going to have a much harder time securing decent living conditions. As long as there are people in my situation, there will be crime, and that affects you.

       Prisoners and slaves don't volunteer; wage laborers have no alternative and thus work involuntarily. If the earth was managed as the collective wealth of all mankind and we were all entitled to use it equally, this wouldn't be a problem. But instead, a ruling class owns all of the resources necessary to sustain life and demand we labor for them to survive.

       Yes, it is. The broken US government is the throne from which capitalism rules the world.

I'd be more use building electrical systems for buildings, and I'd have a much easier time of that in a cooperative rather than competitive economy.

       You've got better arguments than most, but I don't see how anarchy would be any less capitalist than a constitutional republic. I think the answer is consumer activism and socially responsible investing. As in we can create large non-profits and co-ops that create a more socialized egalitarian system without profit motives, all inside of our existing republic.

       Great question. I think they want more... like US sovereignty out of the window all together or somehow a one world government out of Jerusalem or London. It seems they economically (and foreign policy) own us already, so anything more they want might be for religious/occult reasons. I have heard "salvation through sin" and "turn the world evil" a bunch, but I don't know why they need a one world government for that.

       Enclosure forced the vast majority of people into cities and turned the agrarian communities that had previously been the bedrock of society into slave plantations. The harsh, cramped reality of city life encouraged people to plan and look out for smaller family groups, often cut off from the rest of the family by economic migration. The only communal institution that survived the transition to capitalism was the most fucked up and autocratic one, the church.

       Why does the NWO have to destroy it's own seat of power? America is the hegemon ruling the neoliberal order that governs pretty much the whole world outside a few rival power blocs and wacky outliers like Cuba and North Korea.

       Haha you are very pessimistic! I can't say I blame you, I have to try pretty hard to remain optimistic. I think there is a small chance that we will eventually become a Star Trek-like civilization, but I do think its more likely that we will eventually become helpless slaves to a totalitarian one world government that is too powerful to ever overthrow. Who knows what will happen? My biggest regret is that I wont be around to find out.
