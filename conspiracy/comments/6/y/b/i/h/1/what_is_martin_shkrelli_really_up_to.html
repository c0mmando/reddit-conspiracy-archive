<p>But if you take a look at his facebook (<a href="https://i.imgur.com/rKvXYZF.png">imgur</a>) he hasn&#39;t shut up and is talking about Hillary killing people and is offering a reward for her hair. Do you all think it&#39;s even possible he&#39;s so personally interested in this? Is he really suddenly so concerned with politics he&#39;s knowingly risking his life for it?

<p>Your soul is energy, that energy = the mass and the light that comes off it.</p>

<p>Somewhere in there the DNA translates the energy (soul) into a physical parameter but what happens if the soul is nonexistent?</p>

<p>DNA will be manipulated to allow demonic energy to manifest into the physical plane.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If done by the simple human process, yes, with natural aging, but if done by the alien tech / illuminati way it is not. They literally imprint in flesh a copy of the original person at the exact time and age they are at that moment. The Clones need an ID. That ID is built into the DNA, which differs from the actual persons DNA. Try not to think about what you&#39;ve been told to think about genetics. The normal rules of life are just parameters set to keep you from thinking outside the box and maybe discovering something you shouldn&#39;t know about.</p>

<p>It&#39;s also possible that they&#39;ll use him to make an example, because he&#39;s basically the face of Wall Street corporate greed in America. If I were him, I&#39;d be really worried about that. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>He was convicted of a crime.  So he&#39;s attempting to gain the support of internet people with this bullshit trolling in order to somehow sway public opinion, claim he&#39;s being unfairly prosecuted, and get a bunch of sethrich-true believers on his side because they think he&#39;s about to assassinated.</p>

<p>What he thinks this will gain him in federal court I don&#39;t know, it&#39;s ridiculous, the Judge isn&#39;t gonna give a shit that a bunch of conspiracy minded people who hate Hillary want him to be set free.  </p>

<p>Maybe he thinks he can create an &quot;alternate theory&quot; like O.J. Simpson did, and somehow influence people on appeals, but since the jury already gave a verdict, and appeals judges aren&#39;t likely to grant a new trial on the basis of his facebook evidence, I really don&#39;t know his endgame.  I think he is just desperate.    </p>
