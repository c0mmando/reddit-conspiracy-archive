        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The syrian army (SAA)  just lifted the siege of Isis after 1000+ days on Deir Ezzor, which basically means Isis is on the verge of collapse, and Russia with its syrian allies are on the winning streak.</p>

<p>But somehow this isn&#39;t news on any of the western media, you have to go to obscure media like &quot;RT&quot;, &quot;Sputnik&quot; or even Iranian media like &quot;Fars&quot; to hear about it. </p>

<p>The lift is one of the biggest wins in the war against ISIS, like Aleppo, but there seems to be a total media blackout about it. &quot;The West&quot; is losing the war in Syria, so no news reported at all.....</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Syrian state is presented as a rogue state in American foreign policy think tank organizations. Giving them a platform on western media defeating ISIS and liberating Deir Ezzor would portray them as on board on the war on terror. If they are indirectly/directly contributing for the war on terror and defeating terrorists, then it would be hard to mobilize western populations for war against the Syrian gov.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Funny how so many ruthless dictators in the middle East seem to be able to keep a lid on terrorist organizations within their own borders better than anyone else. It&#39;s almost like they know their own people better than any outsider ever could. It&#39;s almost like so many of those ruthless dictators are the lesser of two evils. It&#39;s almost like tptb only give a shit about a ruthless dictators or a terrorist organization when they pose a threat to their bottom line. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Irrelevant. ISIS did not have any presence in Aleppo city when the government were battling to retake it last year. That battle was not a &quot;win in the war against ISIS&quot; because they weren&#39;t even fighting ISIS. </p>

<p>The only link you could make is that retaking Aleppo has freed up troops so that the government can focus on ISIS again. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>ISIS did control territory in other parts of Aleppo <em>province</em> (or governorate), north and east of the city, but not in Aleppo city itself. The links I saw were all referring to events with ISIS in Aleppo province but well outside the city.</p>

<p>In Syria, you have provinces/governorates, and the governorate capitals have the same name as their governorates. Aleppo governorate doesn&#39;t just include Aleppo city.</p>

<p>The last time ISIS were present within Aleppo city itself would probably have been early 2014, when they finally split off from the rest of the rebels and they started fighting each other openly.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry, but how is this news more relevant than one hurricane that flooded a major US city and a second more powerful hurricane threatening to destroy our territories and wreak havoc on Miami?
