       I wouldn't trust them because they are a large company that may very well lie about the risks to make a buck. But I would seek independent information. Not all drugs from big companies are inherently evil.

       Your linked case is just an instance of one pair of twins dying two days after receiving two vaccines. It's not a study, it's basically just an anecdote. If that's the quality you choose to highlight this list of 200 I'm not going to bother with the other 199.

       Hot coffee could kill you from severe burns, hence the new mcdonalds cups after that lawsuit with warning of hot liquid. Unless you have proof that vaccines cause a statistically significant amount of deaths, you are talking out your ass. Vaccines eradicated measles and prevents deaths from the flu in high risk populations.

       Vaccine producing companies can NOT BE HELD LIABLE AT ALL.

       Also if vaccine was so good they would not try to make non vaxxers vax. What, why vaccinr yourself if you think you can still catch it from others.

       You can only sue after you try litigation. You can only sue if you decline the offer of settlement. If you decline the offer, you will never get another one. If you sue, the company's lawyers will stretch the timeline past your budget.
      </p>
      <p>
       The bottom line remains, there is no liability for a company that creates a vaccine as a response to an emergency situation. For instance Merk cannot be sued for all of the harm it's Anthrax Vaccine caused, because Congress conveniently declared a state of emergency for Anthrax in 2001. This was an attempt to ramp up for war against Iraq, while it also made a small company owned by a senator tonnes of money, when the price of the vaccine went from 3 dollars to over a hundred, overnight.
      </p>
      <p>
       This debate is about far more than people are willing to dig through. For the record I am pro-safe-vaccine. I am very against forced vaccinations, as companies and the government have a very bad track record of not using these sort of powers for the good of all, and rather using them to selectively target people for toxic exposure testing and other human guinea pig type stuff.

      <p>
       That's like saying, "you can only sue after you try to sue." If you aren't familiar with what "litigation" means, you may not be fully informed as to how this works.
      </p>
      <p>
       In fact, you're wrong. Holmes v. Merck shows how even a minimally competent lawyer can bring claims totally outside the VICP, not subject to its preclusion or separate requirements. The trial court in that case found that the plaintiffs brought state law claims that were not subject to the federal act at all, and the appellate court affirmed. No court has disagreed with this reasoning, as far as I'm aware.
      </p>
      <p>
       The idea that no one can sue vaccine makers is an anti-vax myth. Like a lot of anti-vax myths, it's
       <em>
        very
       </em>
       resistant to basic facts. The basic fact here is that parents can sue and have sued vaccine makers for damages allegedly caused by vaccines.

       Dude, you are wrong. You have to go through the program first, and if the claim is denied by either party, then and only then can a lawsuit happen. This is because of laws that protect vaccine manufacturers from liability.

       Every time this happens--I point out the basic fact, and an anti-vaxer chimes in with a misinformed "Nuh uh! Actually..."
      </p>
      <p>
       Read. The. Case. Holmes v. Merck is an
       <em>
        example
       </em>
       of parents suing the pharma company, in which the court
       <em>
        explicitly stated
       </em>
       that the majority of their claims were not subject to the VICA.
      </p>
      <p>
       The language you cited is pointing out that claims that the VICP denies can be pursued through civil suits,
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       that all civil suits have to be routed through the VICP. It is true that some civil claims must be so routed, but not all of them. Again, Holmes v. Merck not only explains this, it is an actual example of what you're saying can't happen.

       I realize that you were told otherwise. I know that. The anti-vax blogs are not a trustworthy source of information about this, or other related subjects.

I did not once say you were wrong, but wanted to show the rest of the picture. Both of us clearly want to truth to shine. Well I can only speak for myself.

       There are vaccines that are unsafe. Vaccines shouldn't be forced on people by principle. If you disagree please feel free to debate all you'd like, but painting me as some idiot won't help your arguments. In fact, what is your argument? It seems you're sole purpose is to state a simple fact, and then call people names if they don't seem to blindly accept it.

       There is. Good information doesn't come from people online spreading anti-vax myths, though. If you aren't familiar with the law here, you aren't informed enough to discriminate between the good information and the bad.
      </p>

       My point here is to try to stop the spread of the bad information, that it's impossible to sue pharma or that pharma is immune from liability. It's tough, because whenever you try to tell people that, guys like you feel the need to jump up and spread more disinformation.

       If you can quote the bullshit you suppose that I am spreading, I would be all ears. Unfortunately, you are misrepresenting what I said. I didnt once say you are wrong. I didnt once say nobody can sue. I claimed that people cannot sue until they go through VICS. I was wrong, but noy by much, because a lawsuit is still a very rare thing. So you don't even have much of a point and you are arguing againt what people say rather than what I say. Thats unfair to me, and it is intellectually dishonest.

       So if you are quite done talking about talking, we can either actually talk about something, or just stop. It would be great though, if you would stop calling me names and invalidating my point.
