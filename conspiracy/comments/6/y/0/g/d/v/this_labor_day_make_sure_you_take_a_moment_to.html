        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Make sure you take a moment today to hate unions for organizing and bargaining with their masters in management for better salary, benefits, and holidays. </p>

<p>Make sure you blame all of your problems on union workers who had the balls to stand up for pay raise increases that only barely keep up with the price of inflation. </p>

<p>Make sure you go to Wal-mart today and buy a bunch of plastic shit that was made by a wage-slave in China, who gets paid $2.00 an hour, to do a job a proud union worker used to do in America for 10 times the Chinese wage, plus benefits and holidays. </p>

<p>On this Labor Day, definitely don&#39;t call out the wealthy class of Americans who inherited billions of dollars from their parents, and turned around and used that inherited wealth to attack the American middle class and labor unions with their policies, resulting in a rigged system in which the wealthy cannot possibly ever lose. </p>

<p>This Labor Day, make sure you talk shit about union workers who have been warning about the attack on labor unions and the American middle class for the past 30 years. When doing so, make sure you tack on ad hominems like conspiracy theorist, communist and Marxist socialist when you mock them for standing up for the American working class. </p>

<p>Because if the media and politicians can succeed in getting you to hate labor unions and blaming them for all of your problems, they can succeed in getting you to make Labor Day all about hating labor unions. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah its not like Linus Torvalds (net worth about 1 billion) has ever contributed anything.. oh yeah except the best decentralized version control system (git) and operating system (linux.) Both which were made without offices or corporate infrastructure and were built by independent coders across the planet collaborating online, mostly.</p>

<p>And the world wouldnt be jack shit today if someone didnt take the initiative to build rail roads or tap america for oil. The pioneers of the industrial age may have been cruel to their workers but their INITIATIVE is what provides us with the comforts of today.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Marxism is responsible for untold amounts of death and suffering and has a body count of at least 100 million with Zedong and Stalin and probably over a billion souls that suffered from poor living conditions, starvation, and lack of choices in their marketplace. </p>

<p>Also now would be a good time to remind you that the universe is inherently capitalistic: Computers can be designed so that anyone without a password cannot use that computer or information system. This is an inherent property of computing and the person (programmer or builder) who control who gets to use the computer and has all the passwords can be thought of as the owner of the computer or system admin. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dividing people further by lumping people into classes only separates us further. People hating and wanting to hurt or steal from rich people is arguably a bigger problem than racism and communism has the highest death toll of any ideology thus far. </p>

<p>Many &quot;evil&quot; rich people would be happy to work with you or lend you money to help you create your dreams but if you keep vilifying them and blaming them for what a group of bankers have done or whatnot then you cannot even help your goddamn self.</p>

<p>Here is a video that has very good and concise information about how to get start up capital and make your dreams come true:
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjcIRQuCXr0">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjcIRQuCXr0</a></p>

<p>Also you should diversify your assets because any one of them such as dollars, property, gold (unlikely in the near future,) stocks, or crypto could crash. Rumor is that the dollar is about to crash and contrary to blaming rich people you should blame collectivists that artificially propped up the dollar with unsound economic practices that stemmed from liberal politicians (Obama administration.) </p>

<p>Although you should also learn how to game speculative markets like crypto or stocks because then you will not hate economic games anymore just like poker and be happy that they reward intelligent people.</p>

<p>We don&#39;t need to &#39;steal&#39; anything, we need to take it back. And all that involves is changing names on deeds for our infrastructure, no violence necessary.</p>

<p>Follow the money for the last 300 years and tell me these fortunes that own the world are legitimate and should be respected. Genocide and plunder is the history of our economy.</p>

<p>But all we have to do is take the surplus valley that is being siphoned off by these old fortunes and reinvest it into research and maintenance. The elite can keep their homes and cars and caviar, all we need to do is take back the profits from the empire that our sweat and blood built for them. </p>

<p>Ridiculous fucking argument. &quot;We can reduce corruption by allowing businesses to do whatever they want&quot;. Surely this won&#39;t result in horrible labor practices, environmental disasters and overall unsavory nonsense. </p>

<p>You&#39;re basically arguing the only way we can truly reduce corruption is by reverting to some gilded age policies, and if you truly believe that corporations give a shit about you, your wellbeing or society&#39;s wellbeing you&#39;re an idiot.</p>

<p>I mean, answer this. How do you justify having an economic ideology totally started by and run for wealthy business executives? The people who cooked this shit up are all insanely rich and their ideology is a cheap excuse to pay less taxes and not comply with environmental and labor regulations </p>

<p>And guess what, corporations don&#39;t even need the government to crack skull. Having some issues with labor unions? Pesky poor people trying to get paid a little more? Just hire some private guards (pinkertons), or in the case of walmart, Lockheed Martin to break up unions. </p>

<p>Basically you&#39;re an absolute classcuck if you believe any of this. I guess that&#39;s the point of right wing &quot;&quot;&quot;populism&quot;&quot;&quot; though, make bullshit and vague arguments about &quot;corruption&quot; while fellating oil and Wall Street executives </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Contrary to what you believe most market crashes are caused by regulations. See 2008. </p>

<p>Regulating business practices such as minimum wage does not actually increase worker&#39;s purchasing power because they are simply required to work harder and the cost of products goes up so their purchasing power remains relative. Minimum wage may increase salaries in relation to the cost of land or rent but that is a separate issue. If people want to build cheap housing for people then they should all contribute voluntarily to a fund that houses people instead of using democracy to get corrupt politicians to do their bidding. </p>

<p>Not sure what economic ideology you&#39;re referring to, but if you&#39;re looking at the gilded age; keep in mind that is the period of time that saw the greatest economic status increases from rich to middle class, and middle class to rich in American history. We&#39;re seeing your economic policies in play, and they don&#39;t seem to be matching up well.</p>

<p>MY economic policies? Lmao? You really think that pro-worker and working class policies are what the majority of the governments are doing? Buddy do you even neoliberalism? The fact you think &quot;my&quot; policies are being implemented right now is hilarious. America isn&#39;t even close to a basic social democracy</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Some people don&#39;t want civilization to be reduced to a Marxist shithole. Some people like having &quot;oppertunities&quot; and being able to take out loans so they can start their own businesses. Not everyone would like work for some centralized authority. Not everyone enjoys 9-5 daily grinds and inescapable under communism. Right now you have so many options for how to make a living and that is what a lot of people want to preserve. Look at all the succesful content creators that use Patreon or kickstarter to make their dreams come true. Look how many people have become millionaires through crypto currency. The free market rewards intelligence and creativity and a lot of people want to keep it that way. </p>

<p>I understand if you have been wage slaving your whole life to think that capitalism is evil or money is evil but once you have a taste of self employment you wouldnt wish the world any other way and just because certain groups of people like the Rothchilds or Soros do bad things or manipulate markets unethically that does not mean capitalism is inherently evil or that wealthy people are all bad. Many wealthy people for example would love to loan you money to help you make your dreams come true. </p>

<p>You are a great example of RICHISM. There are millions perhaps billions of people that would let their jealousy or fear justify committing violence against people that have worked hard and are successful. Dont ruin it for all of us because you havent found success yet. The only other prejudice that rivals richism is that towards drug addicts which is a literal holocaust and robs millions of drug addicts of their freedom. Speaking of freedom..</p>

<p>Capitalism is basically just freedom. You dont even have to participate in currency or any market if you choose to. You are perfectly allowed to make your own commie microcosm. I wholeheartidly support that and I think that marxist inclined people should all move somewhere and try out their ideology for real. The problem though is that marxists usually lack creativity and thats why that idealism is so attractive for them. It justifies destruction. But it doesnt have to be that way. You can go on kickstarter and ask for donations to start a Psuedo-Marxist style production company but most people i have said this to reject this idea because they are so married to their dogmas and want to justify violence, thievery, and destruction. Just like ANTIFA. </p>

<p>Also remember that the universe displays ownership intrinsically. Information systems can be programmed to only follow the commands of a user with a password therefore ownership is an inherent law in the universe. Also currency and ownership are organic ideas that monkeys will exhibit. When monkeys learn to trade coins for food the first thing they do is also trade it for sex. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>K, Which &quot;deeds?&quot; Be specific. You said our infrastructure is generating a profit and thats not fair? Please give me an example? </p>

<p>We&#39;re standing on the shoulders of giants and we can thank those who came before us can be thanked for our modern comforts and technology and YES those families should be able to keep their fucking wealth. Anything else is theft and Marxist cronyism. Although I do agree that the dollar is rigged and the federal reserve IS stealing value in the form of inflation but not everyone is as invested in dollars as your average person and wealthy people obviously, usually diversify their assets in ways that dont depreciate. </p>

<p>And letting families keep their mansions and caviar is NOT ENOUGH. Their predecessors worked extremely hard to guarantee the  safety of dozens of generations of their family and that should be respected to honor their work and also because if we start stealing from people then that will undermine confidence in the whole system and decrease motivation to get wealthy which decreases innovation in technology. Lastly the extremely wealthy people today dont just want comforts but they want life extension technology. That could take the form of bio-technical solutions, baby blood, or even a time machine (going forward using general relativity.) The problem is that some of those life extension techniques are not able to be shared among the masses and that is why they are expensive and it&#39;s important that money remains the motivator so those technologies become cheaper in the future but in the future there will always be &quot;winners&quot; that want the privilege of leaping ahead in the relative time dimension and reaping the benefits of the people working on life extension technology in the Earth&#39;s time line. </p>

<p>That&#39;s it right there. This is a collective effort. We built this. Not &quot;them&quot;. We bled for it when there was violence, we starved for it when the market decided food wasn&#39;t profitable enough. We built the trucks and the rails. The industrialists sat back and reaped the profit at the threat of further violence to us. Nothing happens in a vacuum, society accomplished this not some lone families.  </p>

<p>And now we watch as those tools, our work, our history is used against us. British Petroleum and exxon siphons millions out of every podunk town in the US each year. Our taxes and industry are captured to manufacture weapons for raytheon and lockheed, just so they can blow up our surplus value and keep their share valuable. Walstreet uses speculation and interest as a weapon.</p>

<p>The game is rigged and taking back what was stolen isn&#39;t theft. But again, all that means is letting homeless people into empty investment houses, investing the surplus we generate back into the system etc.  </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>it&#39;s about the way you contribute to society</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Maybe, in part.</p>

<p>Class describes a <em>material relationship</em> between the individual and the things that reproduce the society in which they inhabit. Feudal Japan was also a class society, and it divided its society into four (official) classes: the Samurai, the peasants, the artisans, and the merchants. Each class had particular rights and privileges that were in some cases excluded to the other classes. Each class also describes a particular material relation to their society. The Samurai were the only class able to own weapons and train in warfare. Only peasants could farm. &quot;Artisans&quot; describes the broad class of people that make, well, <em>everything</em>. Merchants, because they didn&#39;t actually make anything or create anything but only traded on the labor of others, were relegated to the least official class. </p>

<p>Under Capitalism, there are two classes, roughly speaking: the bourgeois(ie), which owns practically everything, and the prole(tariat) that can only live by selling their labor to the previous. Anyone that has to sell their labor power, whatever it might be, whether they&#39;re standing behind a register or designing the next atom bomb, is technically a member of the proletariat. Without a job, they have no other source of income. The bourgeois, on the other hand, lives by the surplus product derived from the labor the proletariat. Just by owning property, even if it&#39;s abstracted into something like stocks and shares etc, they do not have to work a day in their lives. In some cases, Bill Gates for instance, they own so much that they could never hope to spend it all in a hundred lifetimes. For them, relative to their wealth, everything is so cheap that it&#39;s practically free. </p>

<p>The object of Communism is to abolish this arrangement, making Capitalism impossible in the same way Capitalism made Feudalism impossible. What made the American and French revolts more than just uprisings? Rebellions, coups d&#39;etat, etc, happen frequently throughout history, but only a few of them are called &quot;revolutions.&quot; It&#39;s not revolutionary to depose one monarch only to assume another. It&#39;s not revolutionary to free all currently existing slaves but maintain slave society. The American and French rebellions though <em>were</em> revolutionary, because <em>they sought to make the Feudal form of property ownership and privilege impossible.</em> The American constitution expressly forbids American citizens assuming foreign titles for this reason. No more dukes and earls, no more hereditary nobility, peasants, Divine Right. Instead, everyone is a citizen, with rights, occasionally written down, in a constitution or document of some sort. Property is still (to varying degrees) hereditary, but it&#39;s no longer tied up in titles and a sovereign. Now it just belongs to whoever can afford to pay. You have the deed or document that says you own it, then voila.</p>

<p>There have been other societies, other forms and relations of people and property, with examples still existing here and there. For the most part, the entire planet has been swallowed up by these Capitalist relations and consequently the logic of this class arrangement. Communists, one way or another, want to abolish these relations and the social mores that maintain and facilitate them, to take these vital resources from the idle ownership class and instead put control into the hands of the people that work these factories and machine, and whose toil grows our crops and maintains our bridges and teaches our students. The bourgeois don&#39;t <em>do</em> any of that. They just own everything people need, and the monopoly private property confers lets them if they so choose to keep anyone from using it, up to and including lethal force. </p>

<p>The people that <em>actually do the work</em> though? The countless laborers and engineers and craftsman and experts that it takes to keep everything going? Regardless of how <em>vital</em> their employment might be, it&#39;s never guaranteed, and the instances of people walking in some morning to jobs that they believed they had, only to find pad locks on the doors and armed guards to turn them away. If they&#39;re lucky, they have a relative that can put them up or help them out, or money set aside, <em>something</em>, because if not, they just might be irrevocably <em>fucked</em>. </p>

The internet is so yuuuge that you can get paid doing almost anything whether it&#39;s drawing furries or folding origami. </p>

<p>And i dont buy EVERY billionaire is corrupt or unethical. Many tech companies generated around a billion almost overnight and you cannot tell me that they automatically became corrupt as soon as they reached some magic number. Idk exactly which billionaires are the good ones but they MUST exist. Richard Branson seems chill. </p>

<p>And in the future there is going to be life extension tech that only billionaires can afford. Why would we rally to prevent people from achieving this just because only very few people can have it. Wouldnt it be better to have a few people be able to extend their lives than none at all. And what I am referring to is basically &quot;baby blood&quot; which can be ethically had if they pay enough and take little enough amounts from every child that it doesnt hurt them. And the second tech im referring to would be hypothetical near lightspeed travel, or dense masses, that would allow someone to effectively jump into the future (using special or general relativity) so they can use the life extension tech that people have been working on from the earth&#39;s relative perspective. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok fair point, I&#39;m not 100% sure ALL billionaires are corrupt but it does seem exponentially difficult to become one without corruption/unethical business practices. Perhaps you&#39;re right that luck and investment in the right projects could get someone (not overnight) but on the road to multi millions perhaps one day becoming a billion. But please understand a billion is an insane amount of money for one person.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t like to jump to conclusions so I agree that I can&#39;t claim all billionaires as corrupt but certainly finding an honest, ethical, non corrupt one is extremely difficult/low probability.</p>

<p>Some people think Mr Vaccines Bill Gates is a good guy (LOL). He wasn&#39;t even that much of a good guy in Microsoft days.
I don&#39;t think Branson is completely good either, nowhere near as bad as the worst billionaires but still not legit.
He tried to smear an honest (anti-establishment) UK candidate and as far as I can tell,
he&#39;s certainly been dodging tax.
I admit that if I was a billionaire, I&#39;d dodge tax too but ONLY to stop it 
from getting in the hands of warmongers, big pharma and insurance company parasites, corporate subsidies, etc.
So I would try to find a way to pay my fair share of taxes while avoiding contributing to the military industrial complex.</p>

<p>If I was capable, I&#39;d want to find a way to lobby and/or campaign anonymously in order
to remove corruption from gov so then I could pay taxes for the country&#39;s healthcare without
feeding insane profits to big pharma and insurance companies for example (healthcare is important but I want the money to go to the right places).
Don&#39;t want to sound like I&#39;m selfish, I&#39;m not, I just don&#39;t want to feed greedy parasites, while simultaneously
trying to help my country&#39;s people efficiently.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know man, taking blood from a baby sounds highly unethical.
Even if you were only getting drops at a time, 
that needle doesn&#39;t seem nice for a baby to keep getting stabbed with.</p>

<p>The time travel thing....you really really do not want the elites to get their
hands on such tech. That would probably guarantee the NWO if they can keep
going back to correct their mistakes lol. (Seriously, the top elites want world domination hence NWO global fascism where the people are treated like cattle/slaves. We&#39;re already economic slaves, worldwide worker wages have gone down
despite productivity remaining high. We&#39;re being ripped off deliberately.)</p>

<p>Consider this interesting view: for hundreds/thousands of years, it seems only
the rich or at least super rich could afford to be scholars, scientists, doctors, researchers, etc.
I think we would have achieved immortality a long long time ago if we weren&#39;t ruled by psychopaths.
Some of the elite literally worship Lucifer, and some are part of secret societies and they hoarde wealth unnecessarily
and unethically.</p>

<p>War lords, feudalism, unethical royalty ruling over peasants, slavery, economic slavery, corporate
control of government, crony capitalism, etc.
We&#39;ve always been scammed and crushed by a minority of psychopaths with too much
power and little morals. If humanity stopped the psychopath elites and treated
each other well, leaving no man behind, etc. we&#39;d have figured out
way more than even the CIA is hiding from us.
Forget anti-gravity, we&#39;d probably have immortality, teleportation, free unlimited energy, 
greater understanding in quantum physics, etc.</p>

<p>Make no mistake, it&#39;s always always been the elites that have held back humanity.
Only the wealthy enough had resources and opportunities to make
insane discoveries. Not to minimize their efforts, but how many
Da Vincis, Nikola Teslas, Isaac Newtons, etc. could we have had if
greed and power didn&#39;t infect the elites?</p>

<p>What world we be in if there was no corruption, and if we had
something like democratic socialism, social democracy or at least centrism
in every country on Earth, for hundreds of years?
We wouldn&#39;t be wasting our lives being corporate slaves,
engaging in mindless wars for the elites, we&#39;d have brilliant technology, 
safer medicines, etc.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s say there are 20 million science/tech/medical researchers on Earth,
what if that number went up to like 200 million?
Heck even just an extra million more would dramatically
increase the chance of breakthroughs.
There&#39;s always a better way to do things.</p>

<p>Apparently Nikola Tesla found a way
to transport free energy &quot;from the aether&quot; or something like that
but the elites stopped his funding because it couldn&#39;t
turn a profit.....smh.
People should always come before profit.
Man, if the elites didn&#39;t do that,
there wouldn&#39;t be such a scramble for energy sources,
and wars for oil, pollution, etc. etc.</p>

<p>I know it sounds hippie like,
but humanity is infinitely better than this,
all this poverty, war, divide/conquer, brainwashing corporate media/TV/hollwood, 
toxic food and drug industry, etc. would
cease to exist if the elites had a decent amount of morality.
Somehow, their mentality comes from ancient Egyptian/Babylonian
cults inspired secret societies like the freemasons, illuminati, skull and bones, etc.
They control the money supply, the courts, the media, most politicians, corporations, etc.</p>

<p>A loan from whom? A bank?

<p>The greatest trick Capitalism ever pulled was attributing all its favorite tricks to Communism. Can you guess why Communism was so popular in so many places where the people were being the most heavily exploited? What was China like before and after Batista? How about Chile when the democratically elected socialist president was assassinated for obstructing ITT Tech&#39;s profits? Capitalism sure worked wonders for China, right? The tens of millions of people hooked on opium and the tens of millions more killed by the Japanese--intentionally, as a means of mass extermination--for the sake of their &quot;empire&quot;, but really, just like the British in India, to secure markets for their goods and raw materials and cheap labor for the same, gosh, they just don&#39;t count I guess. To say nothing of the millions killed by the US during the grossly illegal Vietnam conflict. Even today we see the ravages of Capitalism run amok. Iraq is a nuclear waste bowl. Afghanistan is a never-ending hell of warfare kept up for the sake of the profit of Raytheon and Westinghouse and Ge and Boeing etc. Libya was a progressive (relatively speaking), prosperous country, until the Clintons et al got through with it. Now a country where homelessness and hunger had been banished is mired in YET ANOTHER endless civil war. </p>

<p>So let&#39;s talk Socialism. I&#39;d ask you to tell me about the economic development of the Soviet Union, but it&#39;s not like you&#39;ve ever read about it. You have no idea how the USSR built, through several years not only of the most destructive conflicts the world has ever seen, but a debilitating civil war instigated by the West when the Bolsheviks nullified all the debts imperial Russia owed. Hunger was ended. Homelessness was ended. Illiteracy was ended. Women achieved equality with men decades before their Western counterparts.</p>

<p>Cuba, right? Owned by the sugar interests on the one hand and mobsters on the other. Castrol kicks out the US backed military dictator. Black and mixed Cubans are freed from the borderline slavery that they endured before. Their children were taught and educated. Cuba invented a vaccine for cancer and ended mother to infant hiv transfer. </p>

<p>The list goes on and on. Unlike you, the people living and exploited in these places weren&#39;t stupid and ignorant and &quot;tricked&quot; into supporting Communism. They chose communism because of what Capitalism did to them. They rejected the bourgeois property form because it can only exist by exploiting people like them. Capitalism can only exist through theft and exploitation and people that don&#39;t live comfortably insulated from the effects of Capital can see that. Capitalism has ruined the Earth, and it&#39;s going to kill us all unless we can kill it first.</p>

<p>And Christ, on today of all days. You know why you have it so good? <em>In spite</em> of Capitalism. It looked in the US and Europe just like it looks in Bangladesh and Vietnam now. Poor people made to do backbreaking work for slave wages. Children working in dank mines or dangerous factories. Look up the phrase &quot;bread and roses&quot; some time. See what conditions that came out of. Here&#39;s a spoiler: conditions were so bad that the average life expectancy was less than 25. </p>

<p>Weekends, pensions, social security, time off, <em>paid</em> time off, sick leave, <em>not having to work 16 hours a day.</em> These are all things you have socialists and communists and the millions of people they helped organize and mobilize to thank for. Your easy life was bought with their blood, you unwholesome <em>creature.</em></p>

I suppose you&#39;ll be happy to know that &quot;right to work&quot; laws that have over taken most of the country reduce public workers rights to asking for wages (not negotiating). The only power they have is suing in grievous cases of people being dismissed for no reason, safety violations, injury, etc. Usually it&#39;s too expensive to sue except in the most extreme cases so members are told they&#39;re on their own.

    <div class="md"><p>You are a Marxist obfuscating the term libertarian. I&#39;m comfortable with my description of it being a ploy utilized by marxists as you appear to be doing. Libertarianism subscribes to the first use policy to allocate resources in their natural state. It is the method arrived at to allocate previously unused or unowned resources. The basic explanation is that unclaimed or unowned property cannot be considered claimed by an individual until they mix their labor with that property. </p>

<p>Outside of voluntary contracts between consenting individuals, this is the main method of acquiring property in alignment with actual libertarian philosophy. Discussions of the peasantry in Europe is a red herring in discussions regarding the United States.</p>

<p>I&#39;m all for more representation, think it was about 1 representative to 35k individuals back when the link was broken to population for congressional representation. Decentralization of the government, and transfer of power from federal to state to local is something I agree with. </p>

<p>If you want to have a better understanding of why every single communist society has failed, and every single socialist society gets poorer the further they subscribe to the doctrines of Marx you should read Economic Calculations in the Socialist Commonwealth. Can bark up that utopian tree all you want, but it will never work, and will always result in further economic hardships or the citizens of whatever country partake.</p>

The Mondragon Corporation is doing fucking great, but that doesn&#39;t mean their political influence rivals Boeing. The Luma Co-operative broke the Phoebus Cartel&#39;s monopoly on lightbulbs, that doesn&#39;t mean their political influence matches General Electric. It&#39;s essentially the equivalent of stating &quot;Well, their bootstraps are there aren&#39;t they?&quot; and ignoring all else. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not going to argue with you all day because I&#39;m finding capitalist rhetoric tiresome, but here&#39;s Albert Einstein on the effects of capital on politics in his essay <a href="https://monthlyreview.org/2009/05/01/why-socialism/">Why Socialism?</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Private capital tends to become concentrated in few hands, partly because of competition among the capitalists, and partly because technological development and the increasing division of labor encourage the formation of larger units of production at the expense of smaller ones. The result of these developments is an oligarchy of private capital the enormous power of which cannot be effectively checked even by a democratically organized political society. <em>This is true since the members of legislative bodies are selected by political parties, largely financed or otherwise influenced by private capitalists who, for all practical purposes, separate the electorate from the legislature.</em> The consequence is that the representatives of the people do not in fact sufficiently protect the interests of the underprivileged sections of the population. Moreover, under existing conditions, private capitalists inevitably control, directly or indirectly, the main sources of information (press, radio, education). It is thus extremely difficult, and indeed in most cases quite impossible, for the individual citizen to come to objective conclusions and to make intelligent use of his political rights.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>P.p.s. if anyone reading this is naive enough to think things like &quot;capitalism is natural,&quot; you should probably look into the circumstances leading up to the creation of it. Surprise, it&#39;s not natural, it&#39;s the result of (among many other factors) centuries of legal encroachments upon the land held by peasantry which eventually saw them driven from their land, their communal property enclosed and sold to aristocrats, and themselves dispossessed of all means to survive but their sale of labor. This was the creation of the proletariat. Doesn&#39;t seem very natural, it seems very intentional. But you wouldn&#39;t tell Conspiracy that the elite don&#39;t control things, would you? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Some of the facilities I work at use union and non union companies. It depends on which company gets the bid for the specific job. Whoever gives the lowest price for a project wins the work. Sometimes non-union companies get it, sometimes union companies do. </p>

<p>A lot of corporate management have also bought into the anti-union propaganda and that&#39;s why we have to sit down with them and explain everything. Some people think if they hire unions, then they are hiring the mob and it will cause them all kinda of trouble. Mobs have very little control over unions today, and most of the time, they have zero influence at all in many unions. The fact that unions lobby government to change laws to benefit workers is usually a good thing. That&#39;s pretty much their job, and if a non-union company wants to try to outbid a union company because they have shittier safety rules, then it&#39;s good that unions convince some governments to increase the standards. If that non-union company can compete with increased common sense safety standards in place, like being forced to follow OSHA rules, then that is fine. You shouldn&#39;t consider that some kind of evil practice.</p>

One of the problems with Marxists is that they cannot understand that independent producers exist and in the future 3D printers (especially metal) are about to become much better and cheaper and independent contractors are going to be MUCH more popular. Collectivism only hurts these kind of people and Marxist ideology fails to consider this, probably because it was written over a hundred years ago and the only model of production was factories with inhumane working conditions (similar to COMMUNIST China.) </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah and Marxism does not account for the future technologies that have and are emerging. It is based on the outdated factory model. Soon 3D printers will be much better and it will be possible for many independent producers to collaborate on bigger projects. Outlawing free trade and markets and currency in the this future upcoming situation will do no good whatsoever and only serve authoritarianism. We all want freedom but banning together and being violent towards property owners is NOT the answer.</p>

<p>There should be a subset of communism called practical Marxism (maybe ill write a book) where people learn how to work together in order to undermine corporations with decentralized production models. Linux, and Github were both produced this way and physical items like cars or airplanes could be made this way in the future with metal 3D printers. There is a way for all of us to add value to our world and be free without resorting to collectivist authoritarianism. Banning currency and free trade and markets will only give criminals power like the war on drugs has. There is a reason the Russian Mafia are so powerful, because they had to survive under Soviet rule and they had a huge market share because people needed their services. Same with North Korea. The rich in NK almost all made their money with black market activities. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Very funny to see how some people here are attacking this post and framing OP as a marxist... same people that complain about how google, Facebook, Twitter, etc...

    <div class="md"><p>People need to realize whatever their view on Marxism is, not all types of socialism are Marxist.
We have a low socialism-capitalism ratio and ruled by corporate/debt based banking parasites.
I&#39;m in favor of improving the mixed economics ratio.</p>

<p>People wrongly think everything that&#39;s leftist or centrist in any way is &quot;anti-business&quot;
but it&#39;s not.
I want to help people/small/medium businesses, not parasitic tax dodging transnational corporations.
And I&#39;m economically center left and moderately libertarian.</p>

<p>People oversimplify everything.
Hence people get confused, but most people get their politics lesson from the corporate media &quot;communist this, dictator that&quot;
instead of real objective political science.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well as a conservative I don&#39;t entirely dismiss the changes that the left has made to laws, particularly labor laws. I&#39;m not sure I&#39;ve heard anyone on the right blame workers in general and even if they have it&#39;s not something I agree with. </p>

<p>It is a bit strange that you oppose supporting Chinese labor. Yes they are underpaid, but China is lifting their people out of poverty and these jobs, as exploitative as they are, are the biggest contributor to that so your comments can be construed as a bit racist actually. </p>

<p>You would probably find it strange that I agree that wealthy classes can be exploitative and that it is a bad thing. I disagree with your Hegelian dialectic that narrows the conversation into two over simplified concepts: the rich versus the poor. That, of course, is the bedrock of communism. Basically all you&#39;re really doing is isolating people who happen to have money and inventing a theory that gives you permission to take it away from them. I assume you&#39;re a well meaning, perhaps caring individual, but the only correct assessment of this line of thinking is that you plan on committing what we would ordinarily call a crime, but actually a mass crime in this case and using intellectualism and theory to justify your actions.  </p>

<p>You see, I disagree with Marx and I agree with the founding fathers. They basically understood that you can&#39;t use <em>force</em> to make people behave. Love isn&#39;t a set of behaviors that you can just trick people into adopting, hoping the real thing will set in. You can&#39;t ban bad behavior but you might be able to mitigate it somewhat. </p>

<p>This leads to the final issue that the left doesn&#39;t really want to think about: A certain percentage of people are just psychopaths. These people will do just about anything for power. They&#39;ll work 80 hours a week, sell their own mothers, and generally will take advantage of absolutely anyone. This is psychology. These people aren&#39;t just after money, they&#39;re really after the allure of power. From a conspiracy point of view, I think we have to be more realistic and not just stick to what some guy said in the 19th century. We actually have a 20th century field of study, psychology, that gives a much better explanation about the abuse of power. The problem of psychopathy is that you can ban wealth and private property and then all the psychopaths will fully migrate over into the government. As things stand we have them in all areas where there is some power, business, government, academia etc. As soon as you impose socialism, then they all just concentrate into one body i.e. the government, where they get to pass laws, have control over armed men and are generally have easy access to manipulate everyone by using your own good intentions against you. I have no idea why anyone would think that&#39;s a good idea anymore. Labor unions are a perfect example of this, they were just easy targets for outside corruption and takeover by the mafia - perfectly well meaning ideas, but zero protection from predators. And of course in the Soviet Union, there was no private wealth, no one percent to abuse the workers - so what do you think happened? The psychopaths all went into the only power racket in town, the state - and that&#39;s how the really bad shit started to happen.  </p>

<p>The thing with wealth is that, yeah you find psychopaths there and yes they can corrupt people. But they are constrained by the fact that in that realm, they are competing with each other. If one group of psychopaths goes too far you get things like Enron, and the bank bailouts instead of things like the Gulag. And contrary to what the left wants to think the system does correct somewhat for these things. Yeah it&#39;s not the workers paradise that you hope for and it&#39;s definitely not a perfect system but it&#39;s also not a simple case that there are no checks against this type of thing. I&#39;m more comfortable with the real psychopaths being in the business world than in government.</p>

<p>At some point you have to grow up and accept the fact that world is not a great place, it never was, and I think that&#39;s the point. It&#39;s a big game of good versus evil and perhaps one day it will all resolve and we will know the truth about why we are here but for now I think we have to have to take responsibility for this fight as it occurs within ourselves. That IMO is the only way to change the world but in order to do that you need to give people the personal freedom to make mistakes. You can&#39;t herd people and force them to be good. Free will is paramount and I think we need a system that reflects that. Wow and we already have the best one that has ever existed on earth. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for bringing up psychopaths. These guys are the scum of the Earth. sadly, you&#39;re right in that the world is screwed up. We&#39;ve got too many evil ppl i power and a populus that&#39;s largely indifferent so long as they can have a wife, a child, a job, and a beer. In the end, its every man for himself despite our illusions of a civil society. We&#39;re all just apes with space age technology.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>More people should be aware of this distinction.</p>

<p>Maybe I&#39;m oversimplifying here but, aren&#39;t public sector unions just apparatus for extracting more money from taxpayers? What legit purpose do they serve?</p>

<p>And if public sector unions successfully collectively bargain for better pay and benefits than the private sector counterparts, isn&#39;t this basically just lowkey socialism? (Not making a value judgement about the merits of various economic systems, just saying we ought to call shit what it is.)</p>

<p>And now that I think about it, if the government has a monopoly on certain services, and that municipal union decides to strike for whatever reason, isn&#39;t this akin to holding the taxpayers hostage since there&#39;s no reasonable alternative? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Divide and conquer. Thanks for helping the wealthy/corporations destroy unions. The government is in the service of the wealthy and corporations worrying that the people who work for them strikes me as absurd. A teacher&#39;s union negotiating for a decent wage and benefits is a support for unions in general. I suppose you&#39;ll be happy to know that &quot;right to work&quot; laws that have over taken most of the country reduce public workers rights to asking for wages (not negotiating). The only power they have is suing in grievous cases of people being dismissed for no reason, safety violations, injury, etc. Usually it&#39;s too expensive to sue except in the most extreme cases so members are told they&#39;re on their own. Teacher&#39;s wages and benefits are being driven down so that should help make you happy too. </p>
