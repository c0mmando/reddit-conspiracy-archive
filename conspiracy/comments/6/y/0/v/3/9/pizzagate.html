Sometimes I give him the benefit of the doubt, sometimes he goes for theories that are demonstrably untrue.  I know there are misinformation psyops to make some theories look ridiculous by lumping the plausible with unplausible.  Pizzagate is the one theory he is a true believer of that I know little to nothing about, and I don&#39;t want that kind of stuff in my search history.  Anyone who thinks they know the truth about this I would like you to try and convince me.  Please do not be offended by my skepticism.

<p>Was there elite pedophilia happening in comet PP? Probably not.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know next to nothing about this.  My buddy says it&#39;s a huge pedophile ring run by the Democrats.  All I know about this is that it&#39;s supposedly run by the Democratic party, it involved a pizza shop in DC, and they bought and sold children for sex slaves.  </p>

<p>I acknowledge that pedophilia rings exist, I would be a fool not to.  Anything that is illegal or socially repugnant will have an underground operation.  </p>

<p>If you can give me a kind of narative of what has happened in this case, what we know or think, and provide any evidence, that is what I&#39;m looking for.</p>

<p>And just keep in mind that on Voat you&#39;ll be getting a biased opinion. Most are investigating to prove the theory and have come up with some really good leads.  But so far everything is highly circumstantial and relies heavily on making connections. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not afraid to speculate based on evidence, but the problem I see is deciding what the facts are based on speculation, and preaching these &quot;facts&quot; to people.  Obviously you have to make speculations to find a direction in an investigation.  What you can&#39;t do is decide that you&#39;re speculation is enough for proof.  It may be enough to warrant further investigation, but it can&#39;t be considered proof.  </p>

<p>Some of them will pretend to be investigating it and then do stupid stuff to confuse people and discredit the rest of us.

    <div class="md"><p>Not true. There is a lot of very solid stuff posted there like the interview with the Dutch banker [see link for part 3]. </p>

<p>I have seen plenty of posts there from victims who can affirm what happened to them. Saying that &quot;so far everything is highly circumstantial and relies heavily on making connections&quot; just means you have not researched it thoroughly. </p>

<p>Yes there is a lot of speculation and some nonsense, but that in no invalidates the very real evidence that has been presented. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You will not run into images that you are thinking of. Censors have taken care of that quite well. While researching it you will most likely run into the artwork that John Podesta has at his house, many stories from the individuals who were taken advantage of and have grown up, and lots of theories and critical thinking done with proper grasps of reality. </p>

<p>Pedo&#39;s are everywhere and are currently running the world. There are too many synchronism items that pair together with this subject.  I was abused by multiple adults and children as a kid. I am comfortable with speaking of my own happenings but it has taken nearly 30 years of processing to be where I am. </p>

<p>I will say that you hiding yourself from, any potential images/content that will prove to you without a shadow of a doubt that it is real, is not very healthy if your interests are peaked. However, once you start reading into it all and discover how much of the world around you is shaped by these individuals it becomes quite unbearable. Many days i&#39;ve contemplated suicide even more than my normal thoughts of it just because of how vile the racket is. You will most likely lose sleep and start to lose faith in reality itself. </p>

<p>Having more people feel that way, is how we are going to get this all shut down and taken care of (if even possible). </p>

<p>We must all spread the word and knowledge of it to those whose hearts fall ill at first sight of it. The collective consciousness as a whole will wipe out what is unnecessary.</p>

<p>I dont understand what average people are too preoccupied with that they allow this knowledge to deflect right off of them when its clearly right under their nose.  And god knows I&#39;ve tried to spread the word.</p>

<p>In all reality this whole Pizzagate thing is a spec on the radar of organized pedophilia and abuse.  I just hope it has the legs to ralley the collective.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is not just the Democrats. That is why it has stayed covered up for so long. It is also the British government, the CIA, MK Ultra, big banks, the Catholic church, etc INCLUDING the Republicans. Both Bush presidents and their friends the Saudis are all into raping children as a pass time for rich folks. </p>

<p>It has been going on forever. The people who try to investigate it or stop it tend to get murdered. The more you learn about it, the more horrible the whole thing is, for example Child Protective Services is actually taking children away from their parents and supplying them to pedophiles. </p>

<p>I was blowing the whistle on this issue when GW Bush was still in office, for my effort I was labeled as a &quot;Bush hater.&quot; There was a lot of pressure against any mention of Bush criminal activity while he was in office. Now we can see by the way the DNC fraud case was excused, that some people are just plain above the law. People who are above the law do all kinds of evil things like start illegal wars, rape children and blackmail people. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There was absolutely brutality and rape involved in MK Ultra.  This whole line of study originated during WW2 with the handlings of prisoners, and the intellegence war raging.  In fact, its documented that U.S. intellegence recruited over 1600 former Nazi&#39;s in the late 40s and early 50s who assisted in developing this program. </p>

<p>Mind control was not achieved through administering drugs alone.  Although there were certainly drugs involved, its through unfathomable abuse that an individuals mind becomes controllable. All of this was central in MK Ultra and there&#39;s tons of available reading on the topic.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Why do you think <em>you</em> are &quot;operating in a logical way?&quot;</p>

<p>The burden of proof always rests on the original claim. In this case the claim is that a shooter entered the restaurant, brandished his weapon at staff, discharged a round or three (accounts vary) before breaking into the office after shooting straight through the door. This shot miraculously <strong>hit the office web server&#39;s hard disk.</strong></p>

<p>Stop and ask yourself: does this sound like a plausible series of events?</p>

<p>What evidence is there to confirm any of this really happened, except for news media reports (media is all controlled, especially in DC) or eyewitness testimony (unreliable, as accusations are being levelled against those who own and frequent this establishment.)</p>

<p>It&#39;s also odd that a street CCTV camera that should have captured the entire event from start to finish was, for reasons still unknown, commanded to face away from the restaurant a short time before the &quot;shooting&quot; happened.</p>

<p>Does any of this seem plausible to you?</p>

<p>Who is this person? What did he believe? How did he act upon that information? For each of these points you obtained everything you think you know from the media&#39;s reporting, unless you were there of course.</p>

<p>So, once again. Let&#39;s start with the core assumption: is there evidence that any of this happened, or not?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think you understand how burden of proof works. I&#39;ll walk you through it:</p>

<p>What is the default state? Answer: everything is normal.</p>

<p>When <em>something</em> happens, where does the burden of proof lie? Answer: on the person claiming <em>something</em> happened.</p>

<p>Do we have proof that something happened? Answer: No, we do not.</p>

<p>What do we have? Answer: Media reports, eyewitness accounts.</p>

<p>Do we have any physical evidence that corroborates this version of events? Answer: no, just an alleged hole in a door. We have no proof this hole was really in a door in this restaurant, or that if a hole exists that it was caused by a gunshot, or that if it was caused by a gunshot that the alleged shooter did it in the manner described. There is no proof whatsoever for the claim.</p>

<p>Is there any secondary proof to corroborate the eyewitness testimony? Answer: No, there is nothing that shows the alleged &quot;shooter&quot; entering the restaurant or of him doing any shooting.</p>

<p>So what evidence <em>do</em> we have? Answer: photos of a man outside Comet Ping Pong Pizza, apparently being arrested and some eyewitness reports that contradict official police reports. That&#39;s it.</p>

<p>Does this evidence prove the media&#39;s version of events? Answer: no.</p>

<p>Do it disprove the media&#39;s version of events? Answer: no.</p>

<p>So, once again... where does the burden of proof lie, and what is the default state until proven otherwise? Answer: <strong>everything is normal</strong>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When i say the burden of proof is on you I am referring to Occam&#39;s razor as I have been since your first comment.  Your theory requires many jumps of logic while the official report requires one.  I will not accept your report just because there is a lack of evidence.  Lack of evidence is not evidence in itself.  There were eye witnesses which is more than you have for your theory.  Even if you&#39;re right it&#39;s a dead trail.  You can&#39;t expect me to buy the theory wholesale.  Start from the beginning, prove the pizzagate theory, and work forward and maybe you will find evidence of this shooting being a false flag.  Have you tried finding the shooter&#39;s family and questioning them?  Have you tried finding the friends he allegedly tried to recruit?  I&#39;m not even saying you&#39;re wrong, I&#39;m saying you&#39;re making too many assumptions and it&#39;s not possible for a critically thinking skeptical mind to just take it as fact.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

<p>What is my theory? Is an absence of a theory a theory? If you&#39;ll briefly disregard my earlier comment that the media is controlled (it is, but that&#39;s a tangential point) then what I&#39;m trying to articulate is: <strong>there is a lack of evidence, period.</strong></p>

<p>In the absence of evidence should we default to the media/eyewitness version of events? If so, why? Or should a critical thinker default to &quot;this event did not happen as described&quot; until there is evidence beyond reasonable doubt to prove that it did?</p>

<p>Media + eyewitness reports rely on the (easily abused) notion of credibility and suspension of disbelief. They are not hard evidence.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Lack of evidence is not evidence in itself.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Agreed. However, there is often a default position, and this is the position one should take in the absence of evidence. My definition of evidence boils down to physical proof. I have scant regard for testimony and this is true for courtrooms too. In cases where testimony is the only evidence offered, the judge will usually recommend to a jury to acquit the accused (unless the eyewitness happens to hold special reputable status, such as a police officer... you might wonder why the police get special treatment. I know I do.... but I digress)</p>

<p>In this case, in the absence of <em>any</em> hard evidence and with a litany of examples where authorities have staged media hoaxes to suit their agenda, my default position is that the event <strong>did not take place as described</strong> until <strong>proven otherwise</strong>.</p>

<p>My standard of proof is strict because all other forms of evidence are trivial to falsify. If the body of evidence for an alleged crime is not consistent and supported by multiple forms of proof then any theory based on it is rooted in belief, not evidence.</p>

<p>Keep in mind the burden of proof is never on me to disprove the facts being presented, which remain the same: it is alleged that a shooter entered this restaurant and did a bunch of things. I want to see proof of these things having occurred, but none has been produced.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your theory is that the shooting was a false flag, which of course means it&#39;s a distraction to lead us away from the &quot;truth&quot; of pizzagate.  This theory insists that the pizza shop was the center of a covert child sex ring.  You seem to be back peddling, but it also seems to be taking you to a more reasonable stance.  If you want to question the scenario, I take no issue.  My issue arises when you assert that is IS a false flag, and not that it MIGHT be.  I can&#39;t say the truth, all I can say is that the official report, as it stands, seems more likely until I am presented with more compelling evidence.  I&#39;m not saying you&#39;re wrong.  I can&#39;t emphasize this enough.  I&#39;m only saying that you&#39;re operating on far too many assumptions when you assert it IS a false flag.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No worries :)</p>

<p>If you are genuinely interested in learning the facts of pizzagate, as many here have suggested you need to head over to voat.</p>

<p>We are not allowed to link directly, but if you go there, then head to the pizzagate &#39;subverse&#39; (voat&#39;s version of a subreddit) and append &quot;/2092673&quot; to the URL in your browser&#39;s address bar you will find a nice (safe for work) summary.</p>

<p>The executive summary can be found at &quot;/1497611.&quot; Some links will take you to sites like instagram where there are collection of pictures you might find distasteful (although nothing illegal as far as I recall). So, if you would rather not expose yourself to such things (and who could blame you?) then exercise caution and hover over the links to see what they are before clicking.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Id just like to point out one thing, well, maybe more than one thing, as you begin to expose yourself to these types of ideas.  One thing to consider which ive found to be critically important to understanding all of the historical and current truths behind all the organized pedophilia, ritual abuse, MK Ultra, etc.:</p>

<p>The primary weapon of the abusers, individuals and organizations, is misinformation.  Let that statement sink in.</p>

<p>With everything from politics, justice, media, business, etc., being compromised, the reach and precision of the misinformation implanted in the world is without limits. </p>

<p>I could go into truly unbelievable details of measures in which the CIA, from the shadows, is actively discrediting the validity of an MK Ultra abuse victim who has surfaced decades after her abuse as a child and young woman.  But it would take an hour if we were talking, let alone writing on reddit from my phone. </p>

<p>Consider a highly public claim of Cathy O&#39;brien as a more practical example of misimformation as an inherent tool of the abusers:</p>

<p>According to O’Brien, George H. W. Bush used a hologram to appear as a lizard alien in her presence. “Claiming to me to be an alien himself, Bush apparently activated a hologram of the lizard-like “alien” which provided the illusion of Bush transforming like a chameleon before my eyes.</p>

<p>Cathy O&#39;brien&#39;s story notwithstanding, these MK Ultra abuse victims have had their memory and psyche systematically destroyed through measures that are unthinkably satanic.  And make no mistake, MK Ultra was about mind CONTROL.  A proven tactic was to provide the victim with associations of home, family, trust, and other necessary good human insticts, while raping and torturing them in unthinkably horrible and abstract ways, rendering them unable to distinguish good and evil, and unlocking the path to further control their mind.  Though there are many documented effects of this type of abuse, one is the ability to implant forced false memories into the victims memory or whats left of it.</p>

<p>Back to the statement O&#39;brien made about Bush being a hologram lizard alien.  You can see clearly how an abuse victim surfacing saying I was raped and abused by a high profile person is much more believable than I was raped by a hologram lizard alien, right?  This example is much of the same when it comes to the most of the Illuminati, Freemasons, Bilderberg information you&#39;ll find published or discussed all over the internet.  Its nothing more than layers of misinformation implanted to disguise the truth.</p>

<p>TL;DR - Misinformation is the primary weapon used to conceal what equates to a massive, Holocaust level global ring of satanic ritual abuse and pedophilia.  Only with extreme vigilance and determination can you arrive at the truth which exists burried under layers and layers of strategic misinformation.  I do not claim to know everything on this subject, however, we do live in the age of information and a glimpse behind the curtain is waiting for all of you that are determined enough to wade through all the BS required to get there.</p>

<p>Peace, and spread the good word.  There&#39;s too many thousands of victims out there who are to this point sufficiently silenced and are without a voice.  We are their voice.  Use your judgement accordingly.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There was absolutely brutality and rape involved in MK Ultra.  This whole line of study originated during WW2 with the handlings of prisoners, and the intellegence war raging.  In fact, its documented that U.S. intellegence recruited over 1600 former Nazi&#39;s in the late 40s and early 50s who assisted in developing this program. </p>

<p>Mind control was not achieved through administering drugs alone.  Although there were certainly drugs involved, its through unfathomable abuse that an individuals mind becomes controllable. All of this was central in MK Ultra and there&#39;s tons of available reading on the topic.</p>
