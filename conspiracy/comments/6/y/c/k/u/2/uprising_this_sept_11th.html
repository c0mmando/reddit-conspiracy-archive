       A CALL TO ACTION FOR THOSE WHO ARE AWAKE:
      </p>
      <p>
       It is a well-known fact among us that our nation is being governed by multiple factions of bankers, politicians, pedophiles, satanist and various orders who hold malevolent intentions towards the people of this country. As a result, these treacherous people have set into motion various agendas with the objectives ranging from a global dictatorship to global depopulation all the while manipulating and taking advantage of the people every step of the way. Despite this, we the people have allowed such things to go on unanswered for far too long.
We allow false flags such as 9/11 to occur under the guise of foreign terrorism; meanwhile our freedoms our stripped away in exchange for false securities as our troops are being sacrificed as pawns used to accomplish corrupt objectives in the name of freedom and patriotism. We allow them to manufacture public protests to deliberately create racial and political conflict within our country; meanwhile the people begin to divide themselves and progressively turn on one another. We allow the Rothschilds to manipulate and rape our economy filling their own pockets at the expense of the American people; meanwhile our country is consumed by debt. And most disturbingly we allow government officials and people of power to engage in pedophilia by means of child sex trafficking rings such as pizzagate; meanwhile 800,000 of our children mysteriously go missing each year. These are but a taste of the extremely immoral and wicked actions executed either by or under the permission of those in power. When it comes to the fulfillment of these peoples greed, the fulfillment of their agendas, and the fulfillment of their desires; they show no regard for human life whatsoever. They are above the law and immune to prosecution and behave as such, silencing anyone who poses a threat to their wicked way of life. With the escalation of current events along with the decrease of freedom and increase in government control there is no telling how much longer we have to fight back. How much longer will the people willfully be lead as sheep to the slaughter all the while murmuring and cursing those who lead them? If we do not respond with legitimate action we will only continue to be victimized and ultimately silenced indefinitely.
      </p>
      <p>
       With all of this in mind we propose an annual day of retaliation. A day that the people who are awake and aware of the true state of this country stands up and takes action for once. There is one thing that they will always be afraid of and one thing to truly get their attention and that is our strength in numbers. We propose that on this day we will all get together and unite under one simple message: “We know what you have done, we want justice and we want you out.” The locations of these nationwide gatherings will be held at your local state capitol building as a message to our government. As for the states that house any of the 12 Federal Reserve Banks the place of gathering will take place there as a message to the Rothschilds. The day that this will take place each year will be on September 11th. Our very own INDEPENDENCE DAY. A day of remembrance indeed. Now this message is in no way proposing any violence directed at these specific institutions. We would never suggest that at exactly 4:00 pm on this particular day such a gathering should attempt to occupy these buildings as a demonstration of strength and dominance. It might be considered illegal to even suggest such a thing. So instead we ask that you take a moment to reflect on the history of “peaceful protests” and ask yourselves if the voices of such protests were ever truly heard and acknowledged by our leaders or is such an idea only demanded to keep us in line? With this conclusion in mind we ask that you protest accordingly. As September 11th approaches we also ask that you inform others of this day and post this to your social media spreading as much awareness as possible. This day is to be a display of strength and dominance in numbers and will only succeed if such numbers are present. If you are content with the way things are and prefer to continue down this road of destruction then stay in your house on this day and go back to sleep. For those of you who are awake and fed up and ready to take action, we look forward to seeing you.
God bless and happy Independence Day.
      </p>

       Just fyi the vast majority of those 800,000 kids that go missing each year return home. That number is also incidents, it's possible a child ran away multiple times.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        That has boosted the recovery rate for missing children involved in the most dangerous cases in America to 97 percent in 2011 from 62 percent in 1990, according to the center's statistics. That rate is even higher when it includes all missing children, not just the highest-risk cases, which include abductions by a stranger or a family member wanted on a felony arrest warrant, Allen said.

       Not much to say, most of the rest is assumption or generalities. However protesting in/at a federal building is no joke, it would behoove those involved to look into possible legal aid.

       According to your data 24,000 children per year are going permanently missing.  Lets say maybe 5000 are due to unorganized individuals as the crooked, elite owned media continues to portray.  Maybe another 5000 escape on their own will?  Any way you slice it the number is still staggering.  It has been going on for thousands of years and while civilization catches up to most everything these days we still continue to let these cockroaches hide behind their compromised systems and mountains of circumstantial evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem runs much deeper than the Holocaust-level pedophilia and abuse.  It is increasingly evident that humans have been conditioned to avoid this conflict.
      </p>
      <p>
       I dont know what is worse?  The people that dont believe it in the face of all the evidence, or the vast majority who are too ignorant and preoccupied to even care.

       Are you taking 3% from 800 000? That 3% was only referring to high risk cases, not the entire amount of missing children.
      </p>
      <p>
       Earlier in the article it states over 99% of the 800,000 missing children are found, so the number is likely smaller than 8,000 children going permanently missing per year. Hell, in the paragraph I quoted it says the percentage of returned children is higher than 97% when considering all cases. The rest of your post is just hypotheticals.

       The truly good is invariably more powerful than the most malignant evil but that power has to be excercised by the hive mind of the masses for it to be effective.

       Too soon too soon.  I agree with what you are doing and call for the same.  But jumping on this now without more education and advertisement probably won't yield the results you wish for.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the USA they are playing us on the script 1910-1940s 'commies versus nazis', my counter script is everyone versus the world bankers.  I hope that we all, together, can fulfill your sort of goal in all of north america and beyond.
      </p>
      <p>
       But, I think the initial steps are to awaken far more people and then start petitions of concentrated effort.  Steps to follow, I think the 'rally around the bank' idea is far from now though, not trying to stop you in the least, go for it if you know that is the now way to go.  But I think too few are aware.

       I work for Soros because I'm fed up with what the elite are doing to this country? Soros divides the people against each other. I am merely calling for the people to stand up against them and UNITE. And in case you haven't noticed they have already thrown the first punch and already fired the first shot and then the second and then the third and then the fourth and then fifth. If you are content with this pattern then so be it but some of us are a little angry at this point and would like to do something rather than complain about it on the internet.

       I don't view unity as a positive thing.  All unity fundamentally means, is that someone else makes decisions regarding my own life.  I've never heard of unity being advocated by anyone who wasn't a tyrant; it's just a means of getting all of us into a single group so that we can be controlled more easily, because of the negative aspects of human group dynamics working against us.  Unity is a keyword that is used to attempt to emotionally manipulate people.  In the case of most people it works, but not me.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do not agree with your perspective, and I will not feel ashamed for that.  I am not a twenty year old any more, and I am not exclusively controlled by my emotions.  I used to want what you do, but then I realised what it actually means when you have a scenario where there is no regard for the rule of an impartial law.  No one wants neutrality or due process any more.  Everyone wants double standards, where an act is only defined as right or wrong, depending on whether or not it is a person in one's own group who commits said act.  If a member of your side does it, it's right; if a member of the other side does it, it's wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       So before you go on about the immorality of other people's actions, take a step back and ask yourself how much you would be willing to justify or excuse, simply because it was someone from your own group who did it.  That's all I'm seeing any more, these days.  I'm not seeing anyone being held to a standard of right and wrong that applies regardless of identity; I'm seeing people accepting behaviour which they would condemn as reprehensible if it was being engaged in by the other team.

       Fascists and white supremacists might want a regime where people get sent to the ovens if they have the wrong sexual orientation or skin colour, but Leftist revolutionaries like yourself end up being perfectly happy with people being sent to gulags as enemies of the people if they don't agree with your own ideology.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't want any of you.  I don't want Soros, I don't want the hard Right, and I don't want you.

       How does someone standing up for children being raped and abused have a morally superior stance?  The superiority lies with his knowledge of whats taking place and willingness to do something about it, compared to the rest of you who babble on about whatever trying to make a point while missing the point entirely.
      </p>
      <p>
       Remove the conspiracy aspect and new world order bullshit, etc.  Children are being systematically raped and tortured by people in power across the world who are in fact, time and time over again, not being held accountable.  The systematic nature continues to be disregarded, debunked, silenced, swept under the rug, whatever you want to call it but the fact remains.  If it were literally any other offense on this scale, humanity would unite immediately to put an end to it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I commend op for puttin his neck out there.  The rest of you condemning him are only contributing to the continued suffering of children, among as op pointed out, many, many other things.

       Its criminal that this post is in a Conspiracy thread.
      </p>
      <p>
       If i could make a recommendation, draw less conclusions in your writing.  You give these unread critics an easy out.  We need to stay focused on the overwhelming amount of evidence and leave the conclusions to be made by the individual
      </p>
      <p>
       E.G. The common, numbed, ignorant, unread American fuck will respond to your message with this question:
      </p>
      <p>
       How can such conclusion possibly be true (9/11 false flag, injected racial and social division, Rothchild manipulating economy, and so on)??
      </p>
      <p>
       The questions they might ask if you let them draw their own conclusions to the evidence could be something to the effect of:
      </p>
      <p>
       Why the fuck are we not responding to these mountains of evidence?
      </p>
      <p>
       What can we do to give these silenced victims a voice?
      </p>
      <p>
       Thanks for spreading the word bro, keep it up.
