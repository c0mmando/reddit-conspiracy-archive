        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I apologize for what seems like a political post, but I assure you guys that I am here only in an attempt to cut through the disinformation.  I don&#39;t like Podesta either, but if you take the politics out of the equation, maybe we can figure out what the truth is. Is it possible that Podesta was punished with Pizzagate? </p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying pizzagate is real or false. I honestly haven&#39;t looked into it <em>at all</em>, and a person with an open mind should not draw any conclusions on topics they know nothing about. So, let us just put the gory details of pizzagate aside for a bit. </p>

<p>Check Podesta&#39;s Twitter account. Here are a few tweets about UFO&#39;s</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/johnpodesta/status/832383936215015424">https://twitter.com/johnpodesta/status/832383936215015424</a></p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/johnpodesta/status/648879593236103168">https://twitter.com/johnpodesta/status/648879593236103168</a></p>

<p>You can check news articles on it. Google &quot;Podesta UFO.&quot; This dude really believes in aliens. </p>

<p>You can go through wikileaks and check out all of the Podesta emails. Search &quot;alien,&quot; &quot;UFO,&quot; or whatever else you think is relevant. </p>

<p>This one in particular looks pretty crazy, and was released by wikileaks on the same day as Pizzagate got started (Oct 30, 2016). <a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/36957">https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/36957</a></p>

<p>It looks like Podesta forwarded this email. He wrote &quot;FYI&quot; and sent a forward to Leslie Kean with a bunch of UFO information on it. <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/author/leslie-kean">(Leslie Kean is an investigative journalist who writes about UFOs).</a> </p>

<p>For clarity&#39;s sake, the top message is a reply from Kean to Podesta. Underneath that is Podesta&#39;s &quot;FYI&quot; forward to Kean. Below that is a message to Podesta from another person who divulged information about a UFO program. Kean received the entire email from Podesta. </p>

<p>Since it was written before Oct 30, you might say <em>&quot;Wouldn&#39;t the government already know about this email, so it shouldn&#39;t matter when it was released?&quot;</em> I&#39;m not sure. Maybe the government gets so much data that they didn&#39;t notice it until then. I&#39;m not even sure if there is a connection here, but I wanted to start the conversation off somewhere. </p>

<p>What do you guys think? </p>

<p>Here is a pretty good video (over an hour long). It&#39;s basically a lecture about Podesta and his crusade for UFO disclosure over the years. Extremely informative, so if anyone has some time I highly recommend it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ah, I understand. I guess we will have to agree to disagree on that. Podesta&#39;s emails are full of alien discussions and I&#39;m sure he wasn&#39;t expecting those to be made public, just like he wasn&#39;t expecting the pizzagate emails to be made public. I&#39;m having difficulty agreeing with your argument with that in mind. </p>

It seems to have been finished before the election results came out and talks about how both Bill and Hillary Clinton are very much for a degree of UFO file transparency which (knowing what we know about the Clintons) makes me skeptical about why they wanted to open them up. The documentary is very interesting, it talks a lot about the shadow government, the military industrial complex, UFO sightings and technology, etc. Just not entirely sure of its motives and how it ties into this who globalist push from our corrupt leaders.</p>

They are definitely for government transparency. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh, Jesus, can&#39;t you be serious for a second? These are some of the most cunning, ruthless, and ambitious politicians in America and this user is saying they&#39;ve been somewhat open about the presence of alient lifeforms or technology being studied on earth, if you can read the subtext of their statements. Now, even tacityly discussing this is something that would get you tossed in the loony bin not fifteen years ago. They wouldn&#39;t risk looking crazy if they didn&#39;t have serious reason to believe there is something to uncover, right? </p>

<p>I want to know where u/The-Truth-Fairy has been picking up on these subtle comments by the Clintons. I&#39;d like to see some clips and see if I pick up on it too.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think the one has to do with the other whatsoever. You can still view him as a weirdo (or worse, depending on whether you believe Pgate is true or not) and consider his work on UFO disclosure as something good. </p>

<p>A friend of mine does a lot of charitable work, but she sold her prescription medications to people in the past. Does that mean she has never done charitable work? Of course not. I don&#39;t think OP is trying to say Podesta is a good person now. He&#39;s just pointing out something interesting about podesta. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Meanwhile, the &quot;shills&quot; or whoever they are will allow you guys to go on about pizzagate as if that negates Podesta&#39;s views on UFOs. The shills want you guys to focus on pizzagate instead, so they leave the thread alone. </p>

<p>In the grand scheme of things, what is more important? That we are not alone in the universe (or that key new technologies are being held back), or some guy being accused of pedophilia? There&#39;s no evidence he ever touched kids, but the shills want you to pretend there is no question he did for this thread only. </p>

<p>Just something to think about. </p>
