<p>So spiritually it&#39;s saying that after accepting the mark of the beast you are one of the wicked because you chose the beast over God.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Physically, it could go in the left hand, or the right hand, or the forehead, or any part of the body that can be exposed in public legally.</p>

<p>My suspicion is, that it&#39;s a small &quot;Fuck You&quot; to God-the-Father and Jesus.  Jesus is commonly called the right-hand (while Lucifer is commonly called the left-hand, &quot;left hand path&quot;, etc).  </p>

<p>God and Jesus are both against the implant, therefore, mandating the implant in the right hand (or forehead - control the mind of that person) would be a display of ownership, of people God created to be free and to worship Him, instead to Lucifer.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>But RFIDs don&#39;t go in the right hand.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yet.  From what I&#39;ve read, the implant is only in the production testing stage right now.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Who&#39;s actually got one there? One or two futurists? Anyone at all? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes. </p>

<p>A company in Wisconsin is testing an implant voluntarily on some of their employees: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/25/technology/microchips-wisconsin-company-employees.html?mcubz=3">https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/25/technology/microchips-wisconsin-company-employees.html?mcubz=3</a></p>

<p>A train company in Sweden is beginning to make use of implants: <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/travel/news-and-advice/sj-rail-train-tickets-hand-implant-microchip-biometric-sweden-a7793641.html">http://www.independent.co.uk/travel/news-and-advice/sj-rail-train-tickets-hand-implant-microchip-biometric-sweden-a7793641.html</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>And they aren&#39;t required for anything. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is true, right now.  But this is only the beginning stages within public view.  They are voluntary right now, until one day a government mandates its usage.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So the mark of the beast resembles what some people think might happen one day. That&#39;s not very remarkable.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The benefits and efficiency to daily living with an implant linked into a worldwide government and commercial system, is remarkable, even only from a technology viewpoint, in my opinion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The RFID implant will probably only hold a person&#39;s unique account number within the government system, and not all of that person&#39;s financial information.  It&#39;s more efficient to store a single 11-12 digit number than multiple identifiers.  </p>

<p>The entity that is scanning the passive RFID implant will have their system linked to the system which verifies the person&#39;s identity, and in the case of commerce, the transaction.</p>

<p>And I agree completely that it is clearly defined in Revelation.  In addition to the implant being necessary for commerce, it will be used to display loyalty and subjugation to the beast system/government, and the worship of its owner - the implant could be branded with number-of-the-beast or the name-of-the-beast.</p>

<p>Predictive program = Prophesying both mean to interpret before or as it happens. </p>

<p>It&#39;s amazing actually because it is prophecy that the messiah said that it is given unto a select few to see it and the others would be blind.</p>

<p>You say I&#39;m prideful, but miss your own programmed &quot;Christ has got my back, cuz I got Christ&quot; arrogance. Sorry, bro, there&#39;s no God, no Jesus, no Satan either; just a buncha old rich fucks with astronomical fetishes and the belief in magick. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, what man will do is try to fight God by programming men to beleive they are under attack by other men. This is to do nothing more than to gather an army of people who don&#39;t realize they are fighting God.</p>

<p>Project Blue Beam is nothing more than taking prophecy and looking at it from the perspective of the <em>Devil</em> aka <em>The Deceiver</em>.</p>

<p>It&#39;s been planned for a long time, they know that God will come to destroy their kingdoms. That&#39;s why they make movies like Independence day, world of the worlds. Because they understand the Bible and do the exact opposite because they are the Devil.</p>

<p>I have no doubt in my mind you&#39;ll be one of the people begging for the chip. You&#39;re in the wrong spirit at these times. Look around you, everything we know is falling apart and you believe this is because of man? Their entire system and world control is imploding on itself and you think it&#39;s the work of man? Until you open your eyes you will not see.</p>

<p>We just had Rothschild release a whole memo to the world about how they control the world and any entity caught trying to stop that will be eliminated. You think something like that would come out if they controlled everything and that control showed no signs of weakening? </p>

<p><strong>Revelation 19</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>11 And I saw heaven opened, and behold a white horse; and he that sat upon him was called Faithful and True, and in righteousness he doth judge and make war.</p>

<p>12 His eyes were as a flame of fire, and on his head were many crowns; and he had a name written, that no man knew, but he himself.</p>

<p>13 And he was clothed with a vesture dipped in blood: and his name is called The Word of God.</p>

<p>14 And the armies which were in heaven followed him upon white horses, clothed in fine linen, white and clean.</p>

<p>15 And out of his mouth goeth a sharp sword, that with it he should smite the nations: and he shall rule them with a rod of iron: and he treadeth the winepress of the fierceness and wrath of Almighty God.</p>

<p>16 And he hath on his vesture and on his thigh a name written, King Of Kings, And Lord Of Lords.</p>

<p>17 <strong>And I saw an angel standing in the sun; and he cried with a loud voice, saying to all the fowls that fly in the midst of heaven, Come and gather yourselves together unto the supper of the great God;</strong></p>

<p>18 <strong>That ye may eat the flesh of kings, and the flesh of captains, and the flesh of mighty men, and the flesh of horses, and of them that sit on them, and the flesh of all men, both free and bond, both small and great.</strong></p>

<p>19 <strong>And I saw the beast, and the kings of the earth, and their armies, gathered together to make war against him that sat on the horse, and against his army.</strong></p>

<p>20 And the beast was taken, and with him the false prophet that wrought miracles before him, with which he deceived them that had received the mark of the beast, and them that worshipped his image. These both were cast alive into a lake of fire burning with brimstone.</p>

<p>21 And the remnant were slain with the sword of him that sat upon the horse, which sword proceeded out of his mouth: and all the fowls were filled with their flesh.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You see, you don&#39;t believe so you cannot see their fall. </p>

<p>You believe that they are God, so you cannot see God&#39;s works. </p>

<p>How does one believe in <em>evil</em> without believing in <em>good?</em></p>

<p>I however see the prophecies happening and they are unfolding right on point. Soon there will be so much pain in the world that even the non-believers will call on God but he will not hear them because they denied him.</p>

<p>But as the messiah said, these thing <strong>must</strong> come to pass. </p>

<p>You better open your Bible and take a look at it again.</p>

<p>I used to believe this shit. Bless those who persecute you and all that. Til I realized Jesus was sold as an emotion, that my biological human urges aren&#39;t &quot;sinful&quot; and you know, that I don&#39;t have fuckin demons in me, directing my movement or thought. Sure, there&#39;s healthful or destructive choices, but staying within a mindset of guilt, shame and arrogant pride at being a sheep is no longer a way of life. </p>

<p>&quot;THEY&quot; wrote your Bible. And the Torah. THEY are the same as it ever was in the last 5000 years. THEY control the money, the resources, the education and history. THEY will bring Jesus back. THEY will kill billions. They only ones who will survive, just might be the sheeple, easily enslaved to work for thier space bases. </p>

<p>And anyone with a cell phone, debit card and/or smart TV already bought thier damn chip...</p>

You should look up the part of the brain that is actively functioning when praying, meditating etc. Scientists don&#39;t know what to call it because it only seems to be functioning in those scenarios. But either way you shouldn&#39;t judge someone believeing in a higher power just because YOU don&#39;t. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The word Jew does not appear in any bible prior to the 18th hundred. When it first appeared it was meant to be an abbreviation for judean. The Jews did not begin calling themselves Hebrews until the 18th century (See their 1906 Encyclopedia)  In none of the manuscripts of the original Old or New Testament was Jesus described or referred to as a &quot;Jew&quot;. The term originated in the late eighteenth century as an abbreviation of the term Judean and refers to a resident of Judea without regard to race or religion, just as the term &quot;Texan&quot; signifies a person living in Texas.</p>

<p>By the time of Jesus the word Edom or Edomite had been translated by Greek and Latin into Ioudaios and Iudaeus meaning a Judean or person living in Judea. The original King James version of the Bible, 1611, translated Idumaean-Judean into Iewes. It wasn&#39;t until the revised editions of the King James Bible, that the word Jew appeared. The word Jew does not mean Israel or Israelite!</p>

<p>We must conclude therefore that the first &quot;Jews&quot; were Canaanite-Edomite-Hittite. It is certain, according to the Bible, that Jews are not Israel. </p>

If you believe it in your mind, or even just act it out with your hand, then you&#39;ll be allowed to participate in society, otherwise, you will not.  You may already have taken the mark.

    <div class="md"><p>We are also waiting ton the prophecy of Obidiah. Eerily, it is resembling the white race now.
~~~
The white Race is fitting the description </p>

<p>&#39;Because of the violence against your brother Jacob,
    you will be covered with shame;
    you will be destroyed forever.
11 On the day you stood aloof
    while strangers carried off his wealth (Tick)
and foreigners entered his gates&#39; (Tick)</p>

<p>~~~</p>

<p>With current birth-rates, and athesims/communist brainwashing I anticipate the next part of obidiah will be fulfilled in 50 or so year:</p>

<p>&#39;You should not gloat over your brother
    in the day of his misfortune,
nor rejoice over the people of Judah
    in the day of their destruction,
nor boast so much
    in the day of their trouble.
13 You should not march through the gates of my people
    in the day of their disaster,
nor gloat over them in their calamity
    in the day of their disaster,
nor seize their wealth
    in the day of their disaster.
14 You should not wait at the crossroads
    to cut down their fugitives,
nor hand over their survivors
    in the day of their trouble.&#39;</p>

<p>I used to believe this shit. Bless those who persecute you and all that. Til I realized Jesus was sold as an emotion, that my biological human urges aren&#39;t &quot;sinful&quot; and you know, that I don&#39;t have fuckin demons in me, directing my movement or thought. Sure, there&#39;s healthful or destructive choices, but staying within a mindset of guilt, shame and arrogant pride at being a sheep is no longer a way of life. </p>

<p>&quot;THEY&quot; wrote your Bible. And the Torah. THEY are the same as it ever was in the last 5000 years. THEY control the money, the resources, the education and history. THEY will bring Jesus back. THEY will kill billions. They only ones who will survive, just might be the sheeple, easily enslaved to work for thier space bases. </p>

<p>And anyone with a cell phone, debit card and/or smart TV already bought thier damn chip...</p>
