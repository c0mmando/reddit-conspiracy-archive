        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Most of the time with 9/11 conspiracy discussion the focus is on whether or not the towers collapsed due to controlled demolition. But does it really matter?</p>

<p>Presumably the reason it matters is because the collapse of the towers was then used as an excuse to get us into war and take away our civil liberties and all that jazz. But wouldn&#39;t the act of the planes flying into the towers by itself have been enough to do that? What is so necessary about the collapse aspect?</p>

<p>For me it was always damning enough that the government cultivated an environment where an attack was likely to happen, and then the Bush administration let it happen on purpose. (at least)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t worry about the specifics of the attack/demolition either. It&#39;s clear there was detailed advance knowledge and they allowed it to happen at a minimum. Sliverstein benefits most from a total collapse(since public paid for cleanup)  but even if the towers stayed up they&#39;d be ruled a total loss and he&#39;d make a ton of money anyway.  Government players had every reason to go along with it. A few billion in damage and a couple thousand dead is a very low price to pay for the liberties lost. Far more died to secure them in the first place.</p>

i imagine the response to the planes merely flying into the towers would have been something like... </p>

<p>&#39;look at that, those terrorists did their best to desecrate the great monument of american capitalistic superiority... and there they are, still standing.. that&#39;s all you&#39;ve got?&#39;</p>

<p>instead, they knocked them down. and the response was.</p>

<p>they can touch you. be afraid. it could be you next.</p>

<p>the psychological response would have been much different... and as others have mentioned, the billions of dollars in profit... </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Does it matter if the WTC buildings were controlled demo or fell due to fire? Yes, yes it does. Very much so.</p>

<p>If they collapsed due to fire, like they have told us, then it raises a bunch of questions for engineers and we can help provent that from happening in the future.</p>

<p>If it was a controlled demo, the public has been lied to. So that obviously raises a ton of questions. Why did they bring them down? How long were they rigged that way? Were the charges set while people were working in the building? Did they know when planes were due to hit the buildings and why did they do nothing to stop it? Why did they lie to us? So many freakin questions...so many.</p>

<p>It really does matter both ways.</p>

<p>Yes, it matters greatly. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>But wouldn&#39;t the act of the planes flying into the towers by itself have been enough to do that?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The fires would have been extinguished, the dead mourned, the towers renovated. They would have stood as testament for the nation&#39;s – the western world&#39;s_ – resilience, calm, and superiority over the barbarism of terror. A truly strong America, a truly peace-loving NATO doesn&#39;t start a global war over this. Watch Norway&#39;s reaction to the attack on the youth camp a few years ago for comparison, for example. </p>

<p>Now watch any footage of people witnessing the collapse of the South Tower live on TV or in the streets of NY. THIS is the catalyst. THIS is the moment where they scream, at the top of their lungs, &quot;OH MY GOD, OH MY GOD, NOOOOO!&quot;, knees got weak and hairs stood up. </p>

<p>The plane impacts, the fireballs? Meh. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>What is so necessary about the collapse aspect?</p>

<p>It is physical, irrefutable evidence that the official explanation of 9/11 is a blatant lie. Welcome to <a href="/r/towerchallenge">/r/towerchallenge</a>. </p>
