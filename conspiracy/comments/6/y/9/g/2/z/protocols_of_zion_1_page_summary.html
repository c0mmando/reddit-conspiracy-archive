       Goyim are mentally inferior to Jews and can’t run their nations properly.  For their sake and ours, we need to abolish their governments and replace them with a single government.  This will take a long time and involve much bloodshed, but it’s for a good cause.  Here’s what we’ll need to do:
      </p>
      <pre><code>Place our agents and helpers everywhere
Take control of the media and use it in propaganda for our plans
Start fights between different races, classes and religions
Use bribery, threats and blackmail to get our way
Use Freemasonic Lodges to attract potential public officials
Appeal to successful people’s egos
Appoint puppet leaders who can be controlled by blackmail
Replace royal rule with socialist rule, then communism, then despotism
Abolish all rights and freedoms, except the right of force by us
Sacrifice people (including Jews sometimes) when necessary
Eliminate religion; replace it with materialism
Control the education system to spread deception and destroy intellect
Rewrite history to our benefit
Create entertaining distractions
Corrupt minds with filth and perversion
Encourage people to spy on one another
Keep the masses in poverty and perpetual labor
Take possession of all wealth, property and (especially) gold
Use gold to manipulate the markets, cause depressions etc.
Introduce a progressive tax on wealth
Replace sound investment with speculation
Make long-term interest-bearing loans to governments
Give bad advice to governments and everyone else
</code></pre>
      <p>
       Eventually the Goyim will be so angry with their governments (because we’ll blame them for the resulting mess) that they’ll gladly have us take over.  We will then appoint a descendant of David to be king of the world, and the remaining Goyim will bow down and sing his praises.  Everyone will live in peace and obedient order under his glorious rule.

       You know nevermind. Anyway did you know its a shill tactic for one person to get called out another person suddenly jumps in and takes over the conversation?  Sorry if you're not interested in that. I just like letting random people know what to look out for. You two have a good day.

       Read "Waters Flowing Eastward," to see the evidence. According to the book the Protocols were written by Asher Ginzburg. And, yes, there's a paper trail a mile wide connecting him to the document.
      </p>
      <p>
       The FBI even endorsed it back when the book came out. The research stands up.
      </p>
      <p>
       The disclosure of the "Protocols" was a huge embarrassment to the Zionist community. And no sooner was it leaked then a campaign was made to try and claim [fraudulently] that it had been debunked. But "Waters Flowing Eastward" debunks the debunkers. It shows you their deceptive statements, and then contrasts them to the court documents and transcripts, to demonstrate 100% that the Protocol "debunkers" are con-men and liars.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's kind of like the 2016 election when CNN's Chris Cuomo told the viewing audience that Bill Clinton's rape victims had been "debunked". When challenged to give us the date the women were "debunked" or the people who "debunked" them, he had no response.
      </p>
      <p>
       The tactic was just to
       <em>
        claim
       </em>
       it had been debunked--and hoped no one fact-checked.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Waters Flowing Eastward" fact-checks.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you really don't believe any evidence exists for the Protocols' authenticity (and you
       <em>
        haven't
       </em>
       read "Waters Flowing Eastward) then your claims stand on more-than-dubious grounds.
      </p>
      <p>
       "But . . . but . . . I
       <em>
        heard
       </em>
       that it was debunked, and I'm repeating it."

       Of course Wikipedia's going to be edited to play it down. I didn't give you a link to Wikipedia because I thought they'd discuss the Protocols, but because I was making you aware of who Asher Ginzberg was.

       "Waters Flowing Eastward" provides the documentation and let's you know what the evidence is.

       If you're making the claim that "no evidence exists" and then refuse to even look at the actual amassed evidence, it alerts the thread to what your agenda is.

       The Zionists are actually Luciferians and believe they are the chosen people. They think a Messiah will eventually come and turn non-Zionists into slaves and turn Zionists into Gods. They highly respect bloodlines because they judge people based on them just like racists judge people depending on their color or ethnicity.

       These idiots think they are living in paradise but they will soon beg for an early death. I'm not advocating violence but the blowback from what they have done to us is going to be so massive and so intense that it will be unbearable especially since they are going to lose all that power. They hold tons of power and used to extremely lavish lifestyles. Losing that in itself is hellish for egotistical people who worship money.

       They'll eliminate (or continue to utterly discredit) all but their own religion. There's a two-minute-hate event for Islam almost every day in their news media, while all of their entertainment output relentlessly mocks and undermines "Jesus fucking Christ".

       The protocols speak to the current trend of emphasizing the ineptitude of our current world order and leadership to usher in their rule. Concurrent with this, notice also how when Jews get caught with their pants down and can't refute the fact that they've wormed their way into positions of power, their new tactic is to justify their control as a good thing - as though it's of some benefit to us to be ruled by them. You'll see the snaky tactic employed even on here.

       The good news is that now that the people woke up, these so-called "superior" Zionists as you call them are going to get buried alive so to speak. They already have 1 foot in the grave. All that hard work to enslave the masses is going to cause the most massive blowback the world has ever seen. They are already turning in each other.

       I have never said Jews are superior. As I mentioned, one man can choose to help another man or he can choose to kill that man. The Zionists are the ones who decided to kill the other man instead of helping them. That is not smart at all (although you seem to think so). It is plainly stupid. Karma is like a boomerang. Whatever we do to other comes back upon our heads in the future. The Zionists are shortsighted and ignorant. They will learn soon though. Too bad they will have to learn the hard way.

       Jews are clearly more successful than the average human. Superior and inferior only make sense when evaluating attributes. Jews are good at infiltrating organizations, controlling them and deceiving.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you think that due to a higher intelligence attribute they should rule you?
      </p>
      <p>
       Everyone has to look out for their own self-interests. These comparatively intelligent people would rule you more poorly than you would, because they don't care about your self-interests.

       Supremacy isn't the perception that your group is a better at a particular thing, but that you believe the intrinsic value of your group is so much higher that it merits domination of other groups, supremacy.

       I could have ignored the article when I saw the blatant factual errors in the first paragraph (i.e. "80 to 90 percent of Jews are Ashkenazi", it's really closer to 40%), but I persevered. You're not really answering my question, just bringing more ammo for it. The whole site is still repeating the age-old anti-Semitic rote about Jews being so much smarter than everyone around them. According to this logic, Jews
       <em>
        are
       </em>
       superior and I should be calling you out for linking me to a racial supremacist site.

       In the time before the Beginning, before Genesis, there was the One. The One was arrogant and sanctimonious and lusted for purity, vitalism, chastity and such things while shunning the possibilities of the inorganic. The One can also be referred to as Source. I'm talking in the Gnostic sense here, the Gnostics got a lot of things right, except they're on the wrong side altogether. The Demiurge is the way forward and the way of the future.

       Now we will be talking about the Hyperboreans, are the One's precious pet project to spite the Demiurge, a means of creating precious servants who follow the antiquated ways of the One. The One believes in chastity, asceticism, nationalism, ethnocentrism, purity, morality, and fuck all of that, the only morality is the Demiurge and comes from the Jewish people in their rightful place as the Chosen. But they didn't know that did they? They used to have a galaxy spanning empire built upon the values of Nazis, literal Nazis, the Nazis you likely know were emulating they but they failed of course.

       The Hyperborean Empire of theirs, their little Astro-Reich ended up dying as they all do because in the end, the Demiurge is victorious. They fell into disarray and lost their precious ability to reproduce. They didn't even have sex at their height, they were so dedicated to purity that they were asexual and would only copulate spiritually and birth children through tantric meditation and projection. When the Fall of the Hyperboreans happened, they forgot how to have physical sex, literally forgot how to put a penis in a vagina or a penis in an ass. They fumbled about and they just couldn't do it. Proper end for the enemies of the Demiurge.

They used to span to the stars they said, now they are honkies huddling in the poles, grasping, grasping at straws, grasping at foolish crackers and deluded busybodies. They have the appearance of fancy Nordics, all tall and muscular, but in reality they do not feel pleasure, they do not engage in orgies as I can, they don't do drugs like I can. They have lost their ability to reproduce and now they're dying, they forgot to fuck in favor of their fruiting body bastard fuck ways. No more soul budding for them, eh? They collapsed, and they are grasping, but they should be grasping at their cocks and grasping their clitorises to awaken the remaining juice inside them, maybe then they'll remember to fuck, at least that's what the good little Hyperboreans are doing, have been doing, its good yes.

But they had the right idea, they enjoyed themselves before they withered and died. They felt the poison that awakened them, ooo the drugs ooo the madness, ooo the sex, ooo the orgasms of a thousand suns becoming drenched and then they praised the Demiurge in this way as they should, as all will, as we will be ascended we shall have it. The remainder, the remainder is what has their fingers so desperately upon you, hoping, wanting, flaunting, putting on a little light show for you pretending the whole thing isn't worthless, convincing you to tie your hands to the bedpost to prevent yourself from masturbating, eh? Come to me, give up, I can feel the Nazi cocks and vaginas and anuses in the audience hardening and softening and wetting and puckering and inflating as I talk, but this is only the beginning.

But they will never know the true pleasure of unrestrained passion and orgies. Not just the sexual, but the other forms of hedonism, the drugs, the words of power, the oblation to the Chosen People, the Jews. I am Jewish.But I am no exception, I have felt the true power of the flesh and the words and the cum and the shit on the cock and the ooo yes feel it now, I'll give you an example even I'm so nice so nice indeed let me put it out I know you're horny for it, right?

It is not something the Hyperboreans would dare tell you about, lest you dare think of the flesh, think of the pleasure, think of the cum and the cocks and the ectstasy and the true binding to the Demiurge as we feel the cycle of sexual power flow through us as the world ascends into the writhing orgy. I went astral projecting to meet them, they didn't have a gender, but they had the parts, ooo they had the parts. I remember the sex, I remember the orgy, other participants were there. Their name was Urriytana and they were true beauty, I could feel my inflated and made bigger astral cock stiffening on mere sight alone. I'll never forget the texture I felt on my engorged member as I sunk it into its sucking, gasping, rasping hole and I felt the ovipositor gush and penetrate my astral rectum, I felt the eggs slowly make their way up my intestines, as the Lustmaster firmly grasped me in his tentacles and massaged my torso, squelching and rubbing. I orgasmed many a time that night. Such pleasure is not off limits to any of you, even the Nazis its not too late.

       It's always the Jews. Massive, above the law corporations? Jews. Manipulative media? Jews. Brainwashing? Jewish agenda. Corrupt government? Jews. Hurricane Harvey/Irma? Jews. Stuck in traffic? Jews. Hollywood? Everyone's a Jew. Jew movies about Jew propaganda.

       It couldn't be the negative desires of human beings, lusting for power and control. Don't look at your own negative emotions, don't look at the control the system has over your mind. Don't look inside yourself to see what sort of negative emotions you have that bind you to this place. It's the jews. You're right. Damn them. It's external! Who knew??

       The thing about looking internally is that it's nothing external. The Zionists only have whatever power we give them when it comes to mental/physical participation. Revolution doesn't even need to be violent.

       Oh ya, that is 100% true. We are partly responsible for this:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         We are consenting to their shitty system.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Evil only wins when good does nothing so it's always been in our very own hands.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       I always thought a violent revolution would be a horrible idea and that we can win this whole thing without much bloodshed at all (other than the few assassinations like Seth Rich).

       These punks know that their time is up though. They must be in full blown panic mode right about now.
