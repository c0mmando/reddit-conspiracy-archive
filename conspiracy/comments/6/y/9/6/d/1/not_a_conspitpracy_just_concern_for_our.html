        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I lived through Andrew (I lived through every gulf storm upto Andrew and every FL storm since.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s what a Cat 5+ did to south Dade (watch video for full perspective):</p>

<p><a href="http://www.miamiherald.com/news/weather/hurricane/article32006499.html">http://www.miamiherald.com/news/weather/hurricane/article32006499.html</a></p>

<p>Irma is a Cat 5++ the size of Ohio (Andrew was geographically compact, but had sustained winds of 185 miles per hour, for hours).</p>

<p>Here in east Ft Lauderdale, the water is already gone and lines are forming for it. Set your fear flouride aside and fill every pitcher up with tap water.</p>

<p>Fill up your gas tank today (remember--no electricity, no gas). The lines will be insane the closer she gets.</p>

<p>Get cash today (remember--no electricty, no credit cards). The lines will be insane the closer she gets.</p>

<p>Sort your shutters now, matching up those  sons of bitches to their proper windows is always a bitch. If you don&#39;t have them, tge playwood is running out (at full strength it won&#39;t hold. FWIW most shutters prob won&#39;t either, none I&#39;ve even heard of are guaranteed for over sustained 150).</p>

<p>Stock up on propane and charcoal (no elecricity, no stove or microwave). These are going fast too. Get paper plates and plastic utensils (no electricity, no water).</p>

<p>If you have pets, stock up on food for them and don&#39;t forget water for them. </p>

<p>If you can find one, get a landline phone. The cell towers went down even just with Katrina. During Andrew people&#39;s phones still worked as their house was collapsing while theyvwere talking to Ryan Norcros.</p>

<p>Start picking up your yard, it&#39;s like the fucking Congo out there right now and it won&#39;t get better. If you try to do it all at once you&#39;ll passout.</p>

<p>If she stays giagantic, there will be no where for us to run, but remember my great aunt Ella&#39;s adage, who lived through every gulf hurricane, including Camille and Katrina--run from water, HIDE from wind. Her second adage was--the best way to ensure a hurricane misses you is to go to the bother for getting ready for it. I&#39;ve always been an &quot;evening the night before&quot; prepper, but all of the Andrew anniversary pieces has me experiencing PTSD. </p>

<p>You&#39;ve never heard anything like that wind, unless you were there, and I&#39;ve heard plenty hurricane winds before and since. The windows and doors just buckled and were pushed in intact, like a poltergiest. Those of us with concrete block houses still had walls, but If you are in a wood frame house and she comes in as strong as Andrew, find a neighbor with concrete block. Fucking tanks.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t forget that if it comes to it, a matress over a tub saved a lot of lives 25 years ago.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>it&#39;s like 9/11.  they clearly demolished 5+ buildings free fall style and by me saying it was an inside job, i&#39;m only HELPING the victims by HELPING to solve the murder. How disrespectful is it to the victims to say the airplanes brought down the towers when we know that wasn&#39;t the case.  Same thing here.  People will still suffer and are scared, and I pray &amp; meditate that we can divert this storm away from the mainland with help from the light forces, but they need to know the TRUTH.  I am a truth warrior and accept nothing else.  It&#39;s a deep dark hole and the world is controlled from the top by Lucifer loving satanists.  Sorry, but I won&#39;t sugar coat it for you.

<p>Pizzagate is a psy-op hoax in my opinion so you won&#39;t see me doing any of that.  You should probably try to learn who you&#39;re talking to before pulling things out of your ass and making assumptions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Que?</p>

<p>I was probing to see if he thought climate change was made up bullshit or caused by our fuckups with carbon emissions, etc.</p>

<p>But he thinks it is also an engineered problem like hurricanes. Which is at the very least, a consistent worldview.</p>

<p>I value consistency because consistency shows that there is a thought process. It <em>can</em> be reasoned with on some level.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was down there for Hurricane Wilma. Not fun!!! Went 3 weeks (21 days) without electricity in south east Florida. Wilma was a Cat 3 (I think) and it was scary as hell!! The eye went right over my town then stalled! Then we got the blasted by the second half.
Hurricane was frightening. The aftermath was dangerous (fallen wires, street lights and stop signs...and of course fallen trees and palm fronds every few feet.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m both impressed and surprised by the general infrastructure of the US. On the one hand, things like power stay on reasonably well, random fires don&#39;t break out <em>too</em> badly, and the grid is insulated decently. On the other, I look at the homes that cave in like a tinder box, and the total dependence on the grid.</p>

<p>I live in a developing country and a lot of what&#39;s advocated by preppers is just the default here. We use primarily gas for stoves, homes have power inverters and massive diesel generators by default, septic is the norm (as are wells), electric is wired with quality voltage stabilizers, homes are built out of concrete by first choice, we have water purifier systems, etc. </p>

<p>Of course, this isn&#39;t because the country is so much more conscientious and survivor-oriented: it&#39;s still necessity here, due to unreliability of basic municipal services. I watched clips of people livestreaming during hurricane Harvey and I thought to myself that if this happened here, the city would be in total darkness with the internet and power being totally gone. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>As someone in Houston, honestly, if it&#39;s still safe enough and the roads aren&#39;t already packed with people (I really don&#39;t know, so I don&#39;t know if y&#39;all hunker down and right it out, or run for the hills...everyone is different), I&#39;d say get the hell out and just not even be there when it hits.</p>

<p>Just my two cents on dealing recently with a storm...OP gave great advice, and is local. Plus I&#39;m a little tired from a day full of displaced traffic congestion, displaced companies and offices, etc. To everyone in harm&#39;s way, whatever you do, just be safe so you&#39;re here tomorrow and the day after, right?</p>
