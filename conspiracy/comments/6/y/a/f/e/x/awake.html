       How does one know if they are awake? seriously asking.  I am super paranoid and trust no one outside my circles.  how do i know im not blindly following some narrative and not know it? i watch only chosen tv shows and movies and am not regularly being hypnotized by the boob tube.  that doesnt mean im free n clear.  sometimes i feel like being involved and interested in this sub is a narrative in and of itself.  so, how do i REALLY know if im AWAKE?

       its just so hard to know any thruth when all of my time is spent researching the sources.  there is too much info on any subject to pick out the truths from the half thruths from the lies.  i feel like everyone talks about waking up like a light switch goes off and you finally see the big picture but for me all i see is a bunch of greedy fucks at the top doing thier damndest to stay there and continue to keep making money at the expense of the people.  where aliens, antarctica, war, weather manipulation, god, etc fit in i have no fucking clue.  i feel like i can feel what is wrong all around but i cant clearly see it.  its that whole "gut feeling" thing that everyone is so quick to dismiss but what if that feeling of "something is wrong" is the universe or what ever you want to call it telling us all that we need to do something.  idk just feeling really confused and flooded with info lately and guess i needed to rant haha.

       The whole woke vs unwoke idea is bogus. Not one person is fully "woke" . Don't get hung up on being woke. You don't need to know every conspiracy. Start with the ones that directly effect you, or ones that you feel you might be able to change.

       i just wish i could assemble a consilodated site where everything that has been proven true can go.  i feel like we are wasting time individually seeking the truth when we can help each other build upon knowledge.  there is just too much trust to be had by whoever would assemble this archive that we could never have it lol were all paranoid, i think, naturally.  so how can we ever get past this circular track of sharing info.  we need an official spot, an official voice, by the people for the people.  i wish we could march as a nation to the white house lawn and demand every piece of info on everything with no bs redactions just the ficking tuth for once!

       I'd say there is a healthy bit of disinformation in there to make it seem a bit crazy at times... Feel free to skip those parts. You will probably recognise them when you come up on them. My favorite part is no doubt the false realm theory and the nature of the universe. Be careful but in the 20 or so years I've been into this stuff, this is definitely the absolute top layer of it all.

       Yes it's really quite alot and we humans are preprogrammed to reject it as being crazy. It even explains that in there aswell.. But I do believe there is disinfo in there especially the later parts with the so called reptilian shape shifting.. I don't buy that at all.. And some other parts to. And I'm sure a site like this couldn't exist if it weren't mixing real truth with disinfo

       the thing for me is how its written.  it puts forth all of these crazy idea and tries to make you feel stupid for not believing it.  it uses the very ego it talks about not needing to make tou believe.  it says oh your stupid cuz tour programmed and if you dont believe this your stupid cuz of tour programming.  that basically calls out your ego to say "no im mot stupid" and this makes stupid people just eat it up.  i dont know if im explaining correctly but its hard to put these words down this early in the a.m. lol

       this to me takes away from the facts.  there is too much emotion instead of just presenting me with the info and letting me think it over.  he can make all the same points without attacking the reader.  in fact im sure most people who arent as open minded stopped reading because of all the insults being hurled.

       Yes you're right about that. Unfortunately I've not found a ad free site with this type of pure truth ever in 15 years of being into this stuff, and this site has it all in one place. This site therefore removes alot of troublesome legwork for the reader at the time cost of an obnoxious tone towards said reader. That said I urge everyone to do the legwork anyway, but that might take years to gather information from different times and different parts of the Web in order to paint a full picture of the truth. I've done just that and no page to my knowledge breaks it all down like truthism. Even though I personally would have presented it differently.

       thats where im at now.  starting to verify some of this stuff.  im no religous expert or cosmologist but i feel i can at least find things that dont match up.  my biggest question tho is if this is all true, how does this site creator know? where did the concept of square suns come from? if the answer is to be kind to each other and ignore the reptilians it doesnt matter if this is all fake anyway.  thats wat gets me, kust believe, be kind and ignore them.  just seems too easy and too somple of a solution to such a deep and complex issue.

       There isn't any way to verify any of this. It's about faith, really. What rings true to you. Reading all of the texts on xeeattwelve back in 2008 put me on a spiritual ride that hasn't ended since, and everything I've read after it from Mandela effect to pleiadian channeling to HighLevelInsider, to anonymous, to transhumanism, pedogate, and pretty much everything has been successful in painting a picture that leads me to firm belief what the truth is. Again it's about faith and there is no way of verifying its true by any sort of quantifiable evidence. This is all metaphysical stuff and esoteric in nature. At the very core, it's spiritual.

       but how did it come to light? who wrote this down first? im sorry but i font take things in good faith.  i always have an open mind but at the same time i need something more than "if it rings true to you" some people think ots ok to be a pedo because it rings true to them, does that make it right? my point is it could be the work of a good writer who also has done research and just connected dots that were never connected to throw us off the real scent.  i havent finished reading to give my final opinion so dont take this as my only view.

       It will take alot of time to be able to trace back to who wrote what and what lead people to making certain connections. There isn't any simple answer. Noone can give you an answer you're gonna have to find it yourself. I know that's not what you want to hear but the only way you'll ever get that eureka feeling is from you yourself doing alot of studying. Maybe in 10 years you will also be able to go back to truthism and think "man, this really is everything". Or, not. You're gonna have to start somewhere though so start with what strikes you as most fascinating then devote a few weeks to research just that, then move on. This is the only way you'll find answers

       he does state sources tho, for the most part. but i agree that he is going about it in a strange way. i only mentioned that site because it has everything. almost everything. but go ahead and ignore that site, and come back to it in a few years. read some of the texts on xeeatwelve instead. they are far more enlightening.

       see here is the thing, i only just started.  in my own mind the missing pieces are all explained by this but its so right it makes me suspicious.  i have to look more into history and the like because i can trust pictures sources from the history channel.  im just an analytical mind that has to go through and think about the individual pieces and parts to make sure the machine as a whole makes sense to me.

       I completely understand. I'm just saying that for me, doing this for almost 20 years, well i really begun when 911 happened - everything I've learned, I have found that truthism condenses it all into one place. I realise that starting with truthism might not be a good idea but at the very least you can use it as a blueprint and then go and do research of everything you find even remotely interesting. From there you can then make up your mind what you think the truth is. Make a checklist and tick one thing off at a time. Regarding what the answer to all of this is, or what the point to it is, I don't know. And I don't really care either to be honest. I'm not looking for any solutions, all I want is the truth. And seing what type of person you are I would strongly recommend you doing all of the legwork yourself. It's gonna take alot of book reading and text reading but it's gonna be worth it. And you're gonna have to sift thru alot of bullshit to get there, but you strike me as the type of person who needs to do this in order to believe anything. So that's what I recommend.

       yeah all of the footage on youtube including that on thruthism is pure garbage. i dont think they can be seen, no. unless they show themselves. if they even exist, of course. oh man where to start.. i would say david icke is a good source if youre interested in the reptilian thing. he has made extensive research. his books are best and you can probably get them for a few dollars. if you dont want to do that, you can resort to watching a few videos about it. i dont really recommend his lectures though, as they tend to "go on" without THAT much substance. as far as being explainable by truthism, i dont think anything is being explained at all. its just being TOLD.

I already try to do everything it says, I feel like this is the right path that I am going down but idk if the other stuff on this page is something i agree with yet.  I need to look into some of the stuff he says and contemplate this for a while.  do you have any thoughts about this whole thing? there is so much to look at where would i even start?

       Because that's just someone's opinion. For me personally I don't really need people's opinions on what to do or what the solution is. I'd rather just have the facts then make up my own mind about what the solution should be. That's why I feel that's irrelevant.

       I don't know how you can be aware of what is going on if you aren't working from a fact based set of information about our political history.
      </p>
      <p>
       The heading, conspiracy is used to feed a massive amount of lies and simple and dirty political attacks and promote  a specific political ideology, that happens to be highly influenced by both the original John Birch Society and the newer libertarian Birchers.
      </p>
      <p>
       They are not promoting political ideas produced by a democratic republic.
      </p>
      <p>
       This sub is made up of more conservative propaganda and political attacks on any and all liberal or if you prefer, democratic socialist ideas  and policies.
      </p>
      <p>
       Still, at least once or twice a day, an actual conspiracy is mentioned and maybe once or twice a week the conspirators reveal themselves.

       thats what i mean.  how do i know what the truth is on any given topic when there are articles and sources stating two completely different things? it happens all the time then it comes down to a debate about sources but unless your very intimate with all of the info its so easy to get sodetracked or follow the wrong thing.
       <br/>
       Also you say that "real conspiracies" are posted and that the conspiritors receal themselves.  HOW DO YOU KNOW?   When someone just disagrees with something all a sudden they are evil shills.  But the truth is there is so little we KNOW that it makes seeking more knowledge that much harder because the msm and the like bury it in a mountain of dis info and propaganda.  so really what is a sure fire way to know the info you recieve is legit? how can i know that a conspiracy im reading about was ever a conspiracy in the first place? does it not make sense for people who are in on it to flood the area with false narratives? some people can argue anything and have proofs but still be wrong.  so again, how can we streamline info that is true whilst simultaneously squashing lies? and we cant just identify what is tuth and what isnt we would need to share how thise conclusions were made so people can see the transparancy.  but sonce there is no such process its all fuckery

       Of course the information system is flooded by misinformation and one of the biggest lies of the last 50 years is that the MSM is liberal, when the MSM has been pushing a very conservative economic and political agenda since Nixon's first term.

       Stay from wikipedia and Ok, I will see if I can find a list of resources for from Post WWII to present. But it won't be tomorrow. 
On book that is considered liberal, but the author never met a Democratic he couldn't hate is Howard Zinn's. A peoples history of the United States, he is extremely unkind to both Democratic and Republican politicians,  but conservatives automatically hate him., he leans like  Bernie Sanders to  democratic socialist.  But his events and dates are factual.

       There are still differences in the parties but the people who took control of the Democratic Party in the late 80s and early 90s did bring them closer on some issues.
      </p>
      <p>
       And there are differences between a conservative government and a liberal or democratic socialist government.
      </p>
      <p>
       However conservatives have controlled the narrative and dialog in this nation since the Nixon administration and to an extreme level since the 1980s. That followed by a real push for very deliberate confusion about the definition and use of the words, liberal conservative and the addition into the political dialog of the word progressive.  It would take a book to untangle the destruction of the political discussion in our nation especially for anyone under 30. 
No one knows what any of the words and phrases mean from one generation to the next.

       Next step, now that you've mastered the narrative and can recognize, and therefor nullify, programming, is to turn away from the outside.  It's hard because that, seemingly, is where the action is and has been your focus.  News, conspiracy, yet-another-rabbit-hole-to-explore... but this is all narrative-based (confirming or challenging the narrative).
      </p>
      <p>
       Turn inward, and try out meditation.  Literally just sitting with as blank a mind as possible.  Maybe the interweb has a better explanation of "how" but sitting silent for 20-30 minutes is basically it.  Find truths that are not narrative based.
      </p>
      <p>
       Turn your brain on fire!  Soon you'll literally watch less lit humans think and act.  It's like watching little kids try and lie.

       *I am stuck at my solar plexus.  I haven't been able to "unlock" this part of my body.  I think this is where my childhood trauma (fairly light relatively, but we all have it) has settled.  The ancients describe the solar plexus chakra as a 10-petal lotus, so I am trying to imagine and connect to that image inside me, while reading all I can about it.

       Chakras are the physical manifestations of the practice of meditation.  You've likely opened up the first few already without intention.  Perhaps if you bring intention to the next step it'll come apparent.

       thats where im at now.  starting to verify some of this stuff.  im no religous expert or cosmologist but i feel i can at least find things that dont match up.  my biggest question tho is if this is all true, how does this site creator know? where did the concept of square suns come from? if the answer is to be kind to each other and ignore the reptilians it doesnt matter if this is all fake anyway.  thats wat gets me, kust believe, be kind and ignore them.  just seems too easy and too somple of a solution to such a deep and complex issue.
