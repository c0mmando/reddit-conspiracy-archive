Watching the news, they went to a trailer park saying they have little to no chance, and immediately followed that clip with another saying their enacting Bakers Law on the homeless, for their safety of course.
1,130 estimated homeless going to a 20 bed shelter.   the math adds up.</p>

<p>does anyone have the homeless population numbers of big cities following major disasters?</p>

<p>Worst of all, this extends to patients. Not sure about prisoners, but if they owe a fine or have outstanding community service hours or something like that, that can probably also be insured. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>they do that or used to when i was there,in phoenix. they would just kind of start gathering in areas and create villages so the boyz would swoop in clean all theyre shit up bus them to a lock down shelter, and then give them a hundred dollar bill and a bus ticket to any where they wanted to go. most opted for la or Seattle. probably whats happening here. its been going on for years. the object is to break up the concentrations. one city can only handle so much. the guy in that video sounded schizophrenic to me. sadly there is a large portion of homeless that are seriously mentally ill. its illegal to force them in to treatment residences or force them to stay. and this is what happens. the Reagan bush years cut funding to all of the county mental health facility;s across the country and our homeless population exploded. literally quadrupled over night.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>ITCCS put out this letter:</p>

<p>12:30 pm Saturday September 9, 2017</p>

<p>Homeless in Florida are segregated, deported to unknown locations as Hurricane Irma approaches</p>

<p>Poor and homeless people who were standing in line to register at community shelters today have been systematically separated out from the lineups by police and transported to unknown locations.</p>

<p>An eyewitness at a school shelter in Flagler County reported this morning,</p>

<p>&quot;There were a dozen or so of these guys in line, mostly men and a few women, some of them in wheel chairs. The cops got on the blower and read out a bunch of names and told them they all had to get on the bus that just pulled up, it was a local school bus. One of the guys whose name was called objected and asked why it was only the homeless being put on the bus. Two cops immediately grabbed him and forced him on. A lady in a wheel chair started screaming and demanding to know where they were going. I asked one of the cops and he said to the local Salvation Army. But after they forced them on the bus and it left I called my auntie on my cell and she drove by the only Sally Ann in the area and there was no school bus there, the place was all locked up and boarded up against the storm.&quot;</p>

<p>A staff member at a community center shelter in Volusia County confirmed today that an &quot;arrangement&quot; had been made to have anyone either homeless or on social assistance sheltered in &quot;separate facilities&quot;. But the staff member gave no indication where those facilities were or why the transportees had no choice in the matter and were forcibly culled out of the lines by police.</p>

<p>Natural disasters and public events are hot spots for the forced disappearances of the homeless, children and targeted individuals. More than 250 homeless people disappeared off the streets of Vancouver, Canada during the 2010 Olympics and were never seen again. Hundreds of Haitian children vanished at the hands of &quot;disaster relief&quot; agencies in the wake of several recent hurricanes there.</p>

<p>ITCCS field workers in Florida are commencing a search for the missing homeless people of central Florida. Anyone with knowledge of these disappeared should contact our office at the email below. More updates will follow.</p>
