</code></pre>

<p>Regarding the Lyme surveillance system, you always have at least a tenfold under-reporting. And the CDC even admits Lyme is an epidemic. At least 300,000 people are infected with Lyme disease each year in the United States and that number is grossly underestimated; 10 times than what was first reported! That is 25,000 new cases per month. It is more prevalent than HIV, breast cancer and AIDS. The CDC in their own words states that it is the FASTEST GROWING INFECTIOUS DISEASE in the US. </p>

<hr/>

<p>Multinationals decide which researchers get the cash. Researchers wanting to test the postulation of bacterial etiology of MS are shunned as if they were crackpots. Big Pharma makes billions a year on MS symptom relievers and they trickle millions down to their footsoldiers, the “MS experts”. A cure would be a severe financial blow. Even more so, because there is strong evidence that many other neurological illnesses are caused by germs as well. Because due to the phenomenon of immune privilege there is an inadequate immune response in the brain and spinal cord, making these organs the ideal place for certain slow-dividing spirochetal bacteria to entrench, multiply and cause lesions. The entire concept of antibiotic-resistant, hard-to-test-for chronic CNS infections leading to a plethora of neurological syndromes has to be suppressed and what can’t be suppressed will be craftily discredited. Better to give every expression of a neurological infection its own name such as “MS”, “Alzheimers”, “Parkinsons,” “ALS” and “Fibromyalgia”. And fund armies of ignorant “experts” to obfuscate the issue, whilst boycotting, firing, censoring, smearing and suing those few real experts that refuse to stay in line. Big Pharma is in business to make money, and money is made when people are ill, not when they’re healthy. Anyone standing in their way is relegated to the sidelines. Patents are being bought and shelved so that cures will never see the light of day.</p>

</code></pre>

<p>Synopsis: In MS, the plaques have their origin around veins in the central nervous system. This corresponds with the lesions found in neuroborreliosis. The geographical spread of MS correlates strongly with mean annual temperature. The geographical distribution of the ticks that transmit Lyme disease have a similar geographical distribution. There have been MS “epidemics” in the past where 40 times more cases of MS occurred than normal. Those epidemics appear to correlate with the large-scale introduction of dogs or other animals that are hosts for ticks. Postulates that Borrelia spirochetes may be acting as the trigger in MS, setting off an autoimmune reaction in which patients produce antibodies that attack their own nerve fibers. Mentions that Borrelia eat myelin as well. Notes how many particular and peculiar Lyme symptoms are shared with MS symptoms. Mentions a small study in which two out of eight MS patients tested positive for Lyme disease.</p>

<p>Synopsis: 10 out of 26 MS patients tested positive for Lyme borreliosis. Notes how it is virtually impossible to make a distinction between late stage Lyme disease and Multiple sclerosis, not even with MRI. Diagnosis of MS vs. late stage neuroborreliosis are guesswork – there are no reliable tests for either. Conclusion: Multiple sclerosis may often be associated with Borrelia infection.</p>

</code></pre>

<p>Synopsis: Borrelia cysts were found in all ten out of ten patients diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis. No bacteria were found in a control group. The most modern methods such as a transmission electron microscope were used by a specialist in this narrow field – this may explain why a 100% infection rate was found by Brorson, as opposed to lower rates in other research. The cysts turned into spirochetal bacteria when cultured. Remarks that the bacterial infection theory of MS was abandoned because antibiotics did not help. Remarks that Borrelia bacteria have mechanisms to evade the immune system and survive antibiotics, and offers research evidence for that. Concludes that all ten MS patients have been infected with a spirochete. Dismisses the common criticism that “all those MS patients were also infected with an unrelated Lyme disease” by pointing out how unlikely that is, especially seen the ample research evidence for a spirochetal cause of MS. Concludes that MS could very well be a chronic infection. Points out that there is microbiological and clinical evidence that spirochetal bacteria could be the cause of MS. Notes that the spirochetes may not necessarily be of the genus Borrelia burgdorferi. The chance that 100% of MS patients would also have Lyme neuroborreliosis is astronomically small – about one in 1000<sup>10,</sup> a smaller chance to find a speck of dust lost in the Universe. Epidemiologically speaking, Brorson’s findings are near-absolute proof that MS is caused by spirochetal bacteria.</p>

<pre><code>2004 (Switzerland): Chronic Lyme borreliosis at the root of Multiple sclerosis – is a cure with antibiotics attainable? 
</code></pre>

<p>Synopsis: Notes that worldwide, MS prevalence parallels the distribution of the Lyme disease pathogen Borrelia burgdorferi, and in America and Europe, the birth excesses of those individuals who later in life develop MS, exactly mirror the seasonal distributions of Borrelia transmitting Ixodes ticks. No other disease exhibits equally marked epidemiological clusters by season and locality. Cites research whereby spirochetes were found in the brains of MS patients as early as 1928, and that in over 250 control cases of diversified diseases there never were spirochetes found. Notes that this research has been successfully replicated decades later by different scientists. Points out that a considerable body of clinical evidence supports the concept that cystic L-forms of Borrelia Burgdorferi may cause MS. Dismisses skepticism towards this concept with science-based arguments. Dismisses the hypothesis of genetic origin of MS using scientific research data. Includes graphs showing a direct correlation between the number of MS patients and the number of ticks transmitting Lyme disease. Dismisses the “environmental toxin” hypothesis of MS using scientific research data. Explains how Borrelia could cause all MS symptoms. Recommends trials with antibiotics for MS patients.</p>

<pre><code>Criminal Charges; Falsifying diagnostics and Patents
</code></pre>

<p>Now I would like to talk about the criminal charges of the CDC, Yale and falsifying of the diagnostics. Yale has patents on diagnostic tests that are far more accurate than Lyme Deadborn test (15%) and even then they knew that Lyme disease should be perceived as a relapsing fever organism, undergoing antigenic variation. Hence, sufferers will only produce new igM bands if the Lyme spirochete is still alive and not killed by antibiotics or what ever else you use for eradicating bacteria.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Allan Steere also wrote in that same 1986 report, basis of the 1990 CDC case definition</p>

<p>band 41 to diagnose Lyme;; just rule out syphilis: That is important to remember: You only need band 41, or the anti flagellar antibody and the triad of symptoms to diagnose Lyme with common sense rule. Molecular characterization of the humoral response to the 41-kilodalton flagellar antigen of Borrelia burgdorferi, the Lyme Disease spirochete.</p>

<hr/>

<p>The earliest humoral response in patients infected with Borrelia burgdorferi, the agent of Lyme disease, is directed against the spirochete&#39;s 41-kDa flagellar antigen a SPECIFIC band in the Western Blot Lyme test. In order to map the epitopes recognized on this antigen, 11 overlapping fragments spanning the flagellin gene were cloned by polymerase chain reaction and inserted into an Escherichia coli expression vector which directed their expression as fusion proteins containing glutathione S-transferase at the N terminus and a flagellin fragment at the C terminus. Affinity-purified fusion proteins were assayed for reactivity on Western blots (immunoblots) with sera from patients with late-stage Lyme disease. The same immunodominant domain was bound by ser a from 17 of 18 patients. This domain (comprising amino acids 197 to 241) does not share significant homology with other bacterial flagellins and therefore may be useful in serological testing for Lyme disease.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1894359">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1894359</a></p>

<hr/>

<p>US patent 5, 618, 533 - Yale: detects, early, late, neurological, and every other possible kind of Lyme outcome and that it detects 94.4% of the cases , which means it is the closest possible method we could possibly have to detect Lyme (&quot;should be 100% of the 57 cases,&quot; says the FDA, verbatim), and it should be noted that this was a specific method and does not test any other flagellins. When the FDA says &quot;sensitivity,&quot; they really mean &quot;LIMIT OF DETECTION&quot; and refer to the METHOD and not the &quot;CASES.&quot; “Accuracy” addresses cases.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Yale and their patent would solve these problems, however they did not use this method to qualify LYMErix, their other patent, which is the essence of this False Claims Act. Moreover, the other Borrelia in North America and Europe, at least, such a method should be developed and the NIH agrees with this. </p>

<hr/>

<p>The CDC needs to fund the right people willing to research Lyme and all of its forms. However, they still deny that cyst form of the Lyme spirochete exists because it would then be much easier for Lyme to evade immune response and their antibiotic guidelines. Lyme gets about $20 million/year in funding? That may sound like a lot but to put it in prospective: Cancer gets over $6 BILLION/year. Sleep Research gets $235 million/yr. AIDS gets $3.5 BILLION/yr. Smallpox $31million/yr. And that&#39;s just in taxpayers&#39; NIH funds. Smallpox, which the CDC declares is eradicated (no cases since 1977) still gets $30 million/yr in funding. A disease that doesn&#39;t even exist anymore gets more research funds than Lyme. And LYME is more prevalent than AIDS and the fastest growing infectious disease in the world! The NIH website can verify each of these numbers. And that&#39;s just in taxpayer money. Privately, OHSU just received a $100million gift for cancer research. Bottom line, until there&#39;s REAL MONEY in Lyme, NOTHING will be done. Seems to me that the CDC and the IDSA are evading and whitewashing much of Alan MacDonald&#39;s research. Why the unwillingness to fund? </p>

<pre><code>Contd. Criminal Charges; Falsifying diagnostics, Patents and Lyme Vaccine
</code></pre>

<p>I&#39;m am not anti-vaccine, I&#39;m simply a skeptic who has researched the obfuscation of vaccines and their political agendas.</p>

<hr/>

<p>The CDC and Allen Steere knew that Lyme was a relapsing fever organism. It has largely been known since the 80&#39;s. It means that the spirochete undergoes antigenic variation. They knew that sufferers would only produce new iGM bands if the spirochete was still alive in the host. They even said that all you need is band 41 to diagnose Lyme (Mentioned Above); just rule out syphilis. They knew this and then labeled Lyme as largely undetectable, hard to get and easy to treat! </p>

<hr/>

<p>The CDC conducted fraud regarding the Dead-born diagnostics and are reluctant to fund projects that jeopardize their ridiculous guidelines. </p>

<hr/>

<p>Initially: Lyme - Relapsing fever organism; causes various illnesses. Later on: Vaccine candidate; early set of trials; now a non-disease, easily treatable. They then took it off the market and the FDA sued for anti-trust. They simply redefined Lyme to pass off their vaccine.</p>

<hr/>

<p>All in all, the Infectious Disease Society of America and the CDC have committed research fraud to falsify the current, Dearborn case definition. And in order to falsify the outcomes of the OspA Vaccines; Lymerix Vaccine, which was pulled not because of the simply trivial statement of anti-vaccine but because of the FDA ultimatum to the manufacturer. Steere and the CDC wanted substantial financial rewards from a monopoly on all tick borne diseases, vaccines and test kits. Their falsification of the case definition and treatment guidelines have left 85% of actual Lyme sufferers unable to obtain diagnosis, treatment, or insurance coverage for their illness. They had significant conflict of interests and looked to collude with various organizations namely the ALDF where they would use their fraudulent recombinant kits.</p>

<hr/>

<p>THEY CLAIMED Lyme was not a relapsing fever organism, when they KNEW it was and whistle-blowers and documents in the public domain have showed that these people knew it.</p>

<hr/>

<p>So, the made Lyme largely undetectable despite the obvious test patents that are very accurate and sensitive to various strains. No matter how crazy this sounds these people sought to profit off of these vaccines. People have gotten terribly sick off of the Lymerix vaccine and it is well documented. If you have a test that is only 15% accurate (detects 15% of cases), the defendant would have an 85% effective vaccine!! They also used propagandizing tactics and discredited anyone who became sick and suffered from Lyme symptoms after getting the vaccine.</p>

<hr/>

<p>The vaccine was an immunesupressive T-LR21 agonist; Please read this study: <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10865170">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10865170</a></p>

<hr/>

<hr/>

<pre><code>Diagnostics                             
</code></pre>

<p>Think of all bands on the Western Blot Lyme test as Antibodies, some are highly SPECIFIC for Lyme, others cross react with various infections, while still others are not that important. A patient can be positive or quadruple positive for an antibody on the Western Blot test, namely band, <strong>18 kDa</strong>, 21 kDa, <strong>23 kDa</strong>, 28 kDa, 30 kDa, <strong>31 kDa</strong>, <strong>34 kDa</strong>, <strong>39 kDa</strong>, <strong>41 kDa</strong>, 45 kDa, 58 kDa, 66 kDa, <strong>83-93 kDa</strong>. Bands in Bold are HIGHLY SPECIFIC Lyme Antibodies. THe Western Blot features an IgM test (Acute infection) and IgG test (Chronic or Long-term Infection). </p>

<hr/>

<p>The IgM response, +, ++, +++, or ++++ for Band 41 on the Western Blot test before the 1994 case definition is all you needed to diagnose Lyme and get the appropriate treatment because it was easy to rule out all the other infections that cross reacted with this specific band.</p>

<hr/>

<p>During arthritis from Lyme a new IgM response most likely develops into band 31, which I was positive for. But the new case definition based on research fraud and falsification of diagnostics that is still CURRENTLY BEING USED recommends that an IgG immunoblot be considered positive if five of the following 10 bands are present: 18 kDa, 21 kDa (OspC)*, 28 kDa, 30 kDa, 39 kDa, 41 kDa, 45 kDa, 58 kDa, 66 kDa and 93 kDa.</p>

<hr/>

<p>I tested positive for IgM 18 kDa (Specific), 31 kDa (specific), 39 kDa IND (specific); IND means highly likely a single positive, 41 kDa ++++, 83-93 (Specific) IND. I was NEGATIVE by CDC/NYS results, Positive by IGENEX IgM Rsults.</p>

<p>I tested positive for IgG 31, 41 kDa ++, 58 kDa +. I was CDC NEGATIVE, IGENEX RESULT IND.</p>

<hr/>

<p>I had highly specific Lyme bands, symptoms that classically represented Lyme, a tick that I knew I was bitten by and yet even with a positive result for IGENEX I was refused coverage and treatment. Remember prior to 1994, all that was needed was 41 kDa band to diagnose.</p>

<hr/>

<hr/>

<pre><code>Conclusion
</code></pre>

<p>In conclusion, there is growing scientific evidence that chronic Lyme disease does exist, and that this clinical condition is related to persistent infection with B. burgdorferi as shown by microbiological and molecular studies. Persistent infection occurs in animal models and humans because the Lyme spirochete is able to evade both the host immune response and short-course antibiotic therapy to establish chronic infection in protected tissue sites, much like TB. This chronic infection leads to persistent musculoskeletal, neurologic and cardiac symptoms that are the hallmark of chronic Lyme disease. By contrast, the leading theory for persistent symptoms owing to &#39;post-Lyme syndrome&#39;, namely an autoimmune response triggered by the eradicated spirochetal infection, has not been supported by scientific evidence.</p>

<hr/>

<pre><code>Quote from Alan MacDonald:
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
<p>We live in an arena where there are political, as well as scientific and medical discussions. And I think that scientific and medical discussions are important, and political discussions sometimes prevent us from getting very far with our science and our medicine. As long as people enter an opportunity for discussion and dialog with preconceived notions about what they will and will not embrace as an idea, you have a political weight that is dragging down the level of the opportunity to learn from discussion or from listening to patients.</p>

<p>If people decide that there is no such thing as maternal fetal transmission in Lyme disease, then they can&#39;t learn very much when they read my paper, because my paper does show that there is tissue evidence of the infection in newborns that were stillborn, or fetuses that didn&#39;t make it to full term.</p>

<p>And there are opportunities to read other papers and not understand how dormant conditions can exist for twenty or thirty years, such as the ACA model in Europe. If you enter the discussion with a preconceived notion of what you will or will not take away from the discussion, you can&#39;t learn. So politics is an unfortunate mindset, where the mind is closed before the discussion begins. And that&#39;s where a lot of, I think, the politics of discord come from in discussing this, or any other infection.</p>

<p>You know, in the early days of HIV infection, there was a certain reluctance to see it as a public health problem that we know now HIV infections are, in a worldwide basis. But back in the early eighties, when I was beginning my practice, there wasn&#39;t a lot of open mindedness about the need to treat HIV as a medical problem. It was a political problem for people who came from Haiti, or for people who lived in San Francisco who happened to be gay. It was a political problem.</p>

<p>Now, we have gotten past that and we see that HIV is a chronic infection. It&#39;s a medical issue, not a political issue anymore. Sometimes it takes a long time for politics to exit, and for medicine and science to get back on an even keel.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Deep rabbit hole with Lyme. Keep in mind the Lyme spirochete is not the same as borrelia. Check out &quot;harvey borrelia pandemic&quot;. Borrelia has been around as long as we have. A mutual evolutionary ladder. And yes, antibiotics are not enough. A full arsenal is needed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well idk much about MS vs. Lyme disease....but I have MS, and I&#39;ve witnessed the conspiracy to keep us all sick. </p>

<p>My MS treatment was developed decades ago for leukemia. Someone figured out it works in autoimmune diseases too. However, there is already generic version available (good for patients, not so much for drug co). The drug was priced at about 1/6th of all other MS drugs. But it was not FDA approved for MS so hard to get insurance to cover. </p>

<p>When they figured out it works in MS, the Drug co did not try to get approval for the waaay less expensive treatment. Instead, they pulled it from the market, and &quot;reformulated&quot; it by changing one molecule. Wasted years &quot;redeveloping&quot; it, but finally got FDA approved for MS. Once approved, they raised the price to $65,000/year (from about $7k/year). Then they had the balls to advertise it as an affordable MS treatment option, because the 65k price is actually slightly lower than the rest of the MS drug line up.</p>

<p>Icing on the cake? We pay $1579/mo for insurance premiums, and the drug referenced above is NOT covered. So that&#39;s neat!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First, you&#39;re right, that is nearly double our mortgage which is $839 a month. And it&#39;s not even obamacare, it&#39;s my husbands employer-paid insurance. We pay 100% of the premium because we are on COBRA. Yes, we made this choice for him to quit, but we did so in order to start a our own business, which is the only way for me to remain employed living with this crap disease. Its such a mess. Patient assistance programs are based upon last year&#39;s income, so we don&#39;t qualify for anything. I am fortunate to have been accepted into a study where I get my MS drugs for free for 1 year. After that, not sure what happens. :/</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lyme CT is where Lyme Disease was first discovered, hence the name.  Right off the coast is a &quot;secret&quot; government bio lab researching diseases.  It&#39;s supposedly shut down now but was very active.  Lots of locals here in CT think that seagulls might have carried the disease to the mainland here and started spreading it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lyme disease is robbing me of my youth. Im 21 years old, contracted the disease at 15, and was just diagnosed last year via positive IGENEX test. I was forced to drop out of highschool at 16 due to severe joint pain, cognitive decline, stress, and other symptoms. Throughout this process me and my family begun searching frantically for answers, traveling, seeing multiple doctors, specialists, etc.. Ive gotten numerous MRIs, nerve conduction studies, and blood tests with no answers. Its a very scary feeling to know something is severely wrong with you and to have no idea what. </p>

<p>Fast forward to now and Ive been bedridden for over two years. When I say &quot;bedridden&quot; I mean it in the most literal sense possible. I have to lay down for the entire span of the day. Getting up and walking around has to be kept brief before the pain becomes unbearable. I cannot leave my house at all. My cognitive abilities have plummeted drastically. Ive inherited a host of autoimmune issues; severe anxiety; heart arrhythmias, etc.</p>

<p>Been treating for over a year now with little to no improvement. Unable to expand upon my current (extremely limited) treatment protocol as my family simply does not have the financial ability. </p>

<p>If I were to somehow miraculously recover from this you couldn&#39;t pay me a million dollars to even take the slightest chance by living in a high risk area like Wisconsin or the north east. Lyme disease is no laughing matter and will completely rob you of your life if you aren&#39;t cognisant of it. To anyone living in these areas, be careful and don&#39;t end up like me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just tried to write a wall of text telling about my experience with lyme, but I put it aside for now because its too fucking long, and I can&#39;t really think straight right now. (big surprise) I really know what you&#39;re going through, and if you every need anyone to talk to, PM me. (I&#39;m also bed-bound and unable to work right now.)</p>

<p>I struggled with this disease for almost 15 years before I found out what was wrong with me. I had been struggling with extreme fatigue, migraines, anxiety/mood swings, neck pain, impaired cognition, and bizarre skin issues that wouldn&#39;t go away. I went to doctor after incompetent doctor for years with no relief. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve always lived in California. I didn&#39;t have joint pain, I didn&#39;t have paralysis on the left side of my face, and I wasn&#39;t literally bed-bound all of the time, but I was really struggling to keep up with everyone else. I forced my way through high school and college thinking that I was just weak or incapable of strenuous physical activity. </p>

<p>I finally got a good doctor, who tested me for everything under the sun, before finally trying a Lyme test. When I got the positive result, I suddenly remembered that I got a huge bug bite with a <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=ring+rash&amp;amp;atb=v80-2__&amp;amp;iax=1&amp;amp;ia=images">ring rash</a> when I was a child. That was when all the symptoms started. Never in a million years did I think you could have lyme disease for that long. I didn&#39;t even know anything about lyme disease. </p>

<p>That&#39;s when I got pissed. I&#39;ve been treated for a year and a half now, and I&#39;ve never seen such hostility and incompetence in the medical industry when it comes to the disease. Insurance companies are extremely unhelpful in most cases. I&#39;m seeing anti-lyme propaganda . I&#39;m currently getting medication from India because its literally hundreds of times cheaper. Nobody I talk to seems to understand or know anything about it.</p>

<p>Guys, this disease is no joke. Please spread awareness about this. I&#39;m crying right now, because I&#39;m trying my best to explain everything that this disease has put me through, and I am having a really tough at this moment because of its symptoms. It&#39;s hell. The only reason I&#39;m not deleting this poorly written post is because people need to inform themselves about this disease. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was like you but have been getting better with IV antibiotics and strong herbal extracts and herbal IV&#39;s. As for borrelia burgdorferi the bacteria of Lyme, the acute stage is nothing like the persistent, chronic stage with autoimmune MS like symptoms. People in this stage struggle more than congestive heart faliure patients and that is true if you look up studies on pubmed, not only that but because of the polarization many commit suicide. There&#39;s no cure but there is an approach to stop it and keep it asymptomatic if it desseminates, despite what IDSA, CDC or LLMD&#39;s tell you. Killing the pathogen as well as the coinfections which in many cases reinfect older dormant infections simply because of immunosupression which is exactly what many stealth pathogens do including Lyme disease despite what the lying CDC says will not cure anyone.</p>

<hr/>

<p>So, it isn&#39;t about killing the infection in all of its forms, i.e cystic, l-forms, spirochete, biofilms as much as it is to bump up you immune system, especially NK cells with either drugs or potent extracts of reishi or other mushrooms that are 20:1 ratios. Borrelia supresses the immune system, so the longer you have it the harder it will be to test positive and treat it accordingly. I pray you get better. God bless.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><strong>Acute Lyme Disease</strong></p>

<p>A young woman in Pennsylvania was bitten by a pathogen-carrying tick, developed the classical Lyme-associated rash, and proceeded to get very ill over the next seven to ten days. She received several infusions of vitamin C at her house. The first infusion was 100 grams, and her caregiver reported that she seemed much improved upon the completion of that infusion. Five more infusions of 50 grams each were given over the next two days. By the time that 72 hours had passed, she was completely well, never having a clinical relapse or any chronic Lyme symptoms.</p>

<p><strong>Chronic Lyme Disease</strong></p>

<p>A woman with a 12-year history of chronic Lyme disease, documented by blood testing, desired having regular and prolonged high-dose intravenous vitamin C therapy for her condition. Under the aegis of a prescribing physician who had attended one of my presentations of vitamin C, a nurse practitioner was able to give the patient what she wished.</p>

<p>This individual had already been taking liposome-encapsulated vitamin C and glutathione orally without a significant improvement in her condition. On four consecutive days, she received infusions of 25, 50, 75, and then 100 grams of vitamin C. Then, for 19 more days, she received 5 or 6 infusions weekly of 100 grams of vitamin C in each infusion. Until day 23, she felt noimprovement. However, she was determined to continue in spite of the lack of improvement and the increasing expense of the whole process. On day 23, the nurse practitioner reported that she looked like a new person, and that it was like a “switch was flipped” and she was well. At her request, the patient received another week of 100 gram daily infusions to be sure her condition was truly resolved, a very good idea on her part. About a month later, her Lyme blood testing was completely negative.</p>

<p>A physician reported to me similar experiences with a series of Lyme patients, who showed no positive clinical response after an extended number of vitamin C infusions, then had a dramatic, abrupt clinical resolution of their condition, very much as described above.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>metronidazole kills cystic Lyme forms not in its entireity though. REMEMBER, if you get worse on the steroids, even for a week, STOP Them and try a round of antibiotics or something like that. I&#39;ve seen far to many MS patients die because of the supression of their immune systems. Minocycline has helped many MS patients that I&#39;ve had the pleasure to talk to. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay, keep at it then. I should make you aware that my mother was diagnosed with Lupus many years ago and we later on discovered that she had neurological Lyme disease w/ Coinfections. Doctors gave her steroids and prendisone after the Lupus diagnosis, which of course helps the autoimmune aspect of multiple systemic infections. But for her it was not just an autoimmune problem but an autoimmune problem caused by Lyme and coinfections which were the root cause of her autoimmune problems, one could make the case of this with MS. Basically, steroids HELP lower the cytokine cascade of a TH1 response and decrease inflammation even if it may be necessary as in the case of TH1 response against Borrelia burgdorferi. After awhile though, like you&#39;ve stated her eyesight started to degrade. She couldn&#39;t see as well and Lyme causes damage to the optic nerve. The steroids HELP Lyme or borrelia burgdorferi desseminate throughout the body in an altered immune supressed enviorment, which is very, very bad. So, steroids are a no, no for chronic infections. They help the infections to reinfect and give them an enviorment to desseminate especiallly if one is not controlling the bacteria or viruses or coinfections of lyme with some sort of antibiotic. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s ONE study that states that borrelia burgdoferi (lyme) was found on a frozen man 1000 of years ago. The media, the CDC all promoting this study without actually showing where it says it. Once I found it and read it, the conclusion is NOT what they were advertising. It actually says that it most likely was a different spirochetal disease altogether and wasn&#39;t Lyme due to its genetic difference. SO WTF, the media literally just obfuscated a study, when clearly if someone just looked up the study would see that it wasn&#39;t Lyme that they found or at least concluded that it probably wasn&#39;t. That brings us then to Plum Island.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Under progect paperclip the Us pardoned nazi bioweapon scientists who studied ticks on their own people to come to america and work at plum island a few miles off the coast of Lyme, CT. They tested borrelia and worked with ticks often. Of course that is where Lyme came from, right mear plum island. Read Lab 257. </p>

<p>So what is up with the epidemic of Lyme disease getting under-reported? You can&#39;t replace one disease with another disease and call that progress. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I live in one of the counties on the US highest in Lyme; and that&#39;s just diagnosed cases. I first got it twenty years ago and no doctor would give me antibiotics. I have contracted it again and again, as has my hubby. Lately most docs have been more willing to treat it, except when my guy came down with the classic high fever and joint pain etc. this summer I had to scream at his primary care before he begrudgingly coughed up some doxy. Fortunately I always keep a little extra on hand and was able to give it to my husband so he didn&#39;t die while I fought with his primary care. Cases of babesia are also very bad this year; people otherwise healthy dying from it very fast at local hospitals because they just present with high fever. There is so much willful, conspiratorial ignorance and obfuscation around Lyme and its confections.</p>

<p>Contrast that with our dog who got it ( again.) Vets don&#39;t mess around; they instantly prescribed huge doses of doxy. I found it confusing that a dog weighing half of what a human does was prescribed twice the dosage that we receive as humans.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I got bit by a tick in 2014, got the bullseye rash, went to the doctor and they diagnosed me with Lupus.  Put me on massive amounts of prednisone which nearly killed me. aka steroids is the worst thing for Lyme when you get bit.</p>

<p>I&#39;m now working with a lawyer for a misdiagnosis lawsuit.</p>

<p>In my medical records to the doctor it states:</p>

<p>&quot;Patient was walking dog regularly every day, when he noticed a tick and pulled it off.  A bullseye rash formed.  We are going to treat him today for Lupus SLE&quot;...</p>

<p>This has destroyed my 30s.  I&#39;ve lost nearly 10 years on my life due to suffering.  </p>

<p>Fuck the medical community is all I gotta say.  </p>

<p>I&#39;m now taking 120 pills a day, and it costs me $1800 a month out of pocket to go see the Lyme Dr and get the medication non antibiotics.  My insurance is paying another $3200 a month to cover the cost of the prescriptions.  </p>

<p>I&#39;ve had to change my diet, my life style, etc.</p>

<p>When I was originally diagnosed they told me I was highly allergic to the sun, and I should never be in direct contact.  They told me all this without even running a single test.</p>

<p>My goal is to own the doctor.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I had Lyme, it was brutal. Luckily I figured it out 2 months in. I started having awful headaches that nothing could cure, getting worse over a week. Then one morning, half of my face stopped working. Bells Palsy via lyme-induced meningitis. </p>

<p>Since then I feel mostly fine, but I can&#39;t help but think I&#39;m not as cognitively sharp as I used to be. I think I have a harder time concentrating and my memory is shoddy, kinda just feeling cloudy all the time. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lyme diseaser here. I lived in Connecticut for 20 years. Got it at age 19. I didn&#39;t know it was Lymes at first. But I looked up the symptoms, from the bulls eye mark to fever and everything. Go to doctor and I tell him I think I have Lymes disease. He leaves the room, comes back and says I think you&#39;re right and have lymes. </p>

<p>So I agree, I don&#39;t think doctors and others take it seriously enough. I literally felt like I was dying. My whole body was stiff, screaming headaches, couldn&#39;t eat. It was misery. I treated it fast thankfully and was on medication for it. I think I got rid of it, but I&#39;m not sure because I was never retested for it after the meds. But while on the meds I woke up 5-6 times a night in pools of sweat in my bed. Ticks were my primary reason for leaving CT at age 20. I went back a year later for my sisters graduation that was outside, I&#39;m standing in grass and I have three ticks on my legs. At that point in just thinking about how all these people may have lymes disease already and not even know it. That and how I&#39;m never returning. I was lucky and had early signs of lymes.</p>

So far this year I have gotten 3 tick bites, 1 lone star, 1 deer, and 1 unknown. After I read the article I thought to myself it might be a conspiracy to promote Lyme disease and rake in money. After reading your post, it confirms my theory even more. I would not put it past our government to create an epidemic. Stay safe my friends and be careful in the outdoors.</p>
