       I've noticed a disturbing trend on conspiracy.
      </p>
      <p>
       a number of "truth advocates" demonstrate a remarkable ability to ignore the past 2000 years of history and act like believing in some "alternative facts" version of The Bible makes them inheritly intellectuallly superior to their peers.
      </p>
      <p>
       What is actually happening is you are being manipulated by the machine into thinking you have discovered some long lost truth that miainstream christians have either discarded, forgotten about, or willfully fought against!
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't be so plebian!  These holy wars have raged on for
       <strong>
        thousands of years
       </strong>
       and whatever-sea-scrolls you read are nothing new.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is no nephilem.  There is no Jesus.  There is no God.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thinking otherwise is an insult to freedom of thought.

       I'd also like to add that the idea of biblical literalism is only a few hundred years old and if you truly believe that then you are willingly deluding yourself
      </p>
      <p>
       Though I think there's a fair chance Jesus did exist as a wandering teacher, nothing more of course. He also may be an amalgamation of numerous different teachers

       Christanity is the exact opposite of Judaism. There isna reason why all those BASED Christian kings kicked the kikes out. There is a reason why EVERY fascist movement was backed by Christanity  (Hitler, Codreanu, Mussolini, Franco, etc)
      </p>
      <p>
       Heck, even the most famous Orthodox Church father (St John Chrysostom) hated Jews.

      <p>
       So cut your (((satanic))) BS and go back to Israel, you fucking kike.

       Sarcasm friend. Guy flew off the handle, which almost always happens when someone questions or insults Christianity here.

       It's funny. You can attack Judaism all you like here, but the second you attack Christianity, people start foaming at the mouth.

       Ooh yeah. Personally I try to glean the nice things from the Bible and even from other religions that I feel can help me be a better person, friend, father, teacher, coworker etc. Past that, just believe in something, anything, as long as you have some kind of faith. I see little need to argue over something we can't possibly ever know until we (maybe) cross the astral plane into some higher reality. Organized religion is a chain of the world's most devout book clubs at this point. Just be good and the rest doesn't really matter, right?

       I believe in God, the Most High. Christ is his final Covenant with mankind fulfilled. After, 5,500 years, Christ abolished all religion and all sin. He freed us all from the curse placed upon us by Adam. "It is done!"
, 
Let no priest,rabbi, pope or mullah fool you. You are children of God and he loves you all.

       Your an idiot, you just dogmatically stated there is no God (how do you know, faith I guess) there is no Jesus (can argue his divinity all day, but he is an actual historic figure that existed) and for you to accuse anyone who believe differently than your dogmatic faith is an insult to freedom? You are an insult to this sub, and you just can't handle your hate for chrsistians. Maybe you were molested by a priest or something or had an abusive parent that was very religous. You have some issues if this is what your focused on, and if you think any way being waged right now is a holy war, your an idiot.  Hell the crusades were not even holy wars. So good luck with your campaign against free thinking.

       So free thought allows you to mock those you don't' agree with? I mean here is the thing to me no matter what you believe and you can believe whatever you want I'm not trying to convince you of anything other than to be more open minded. About the possibility. I mean think about this I believe that it's totally possible that I couldn't even comprehend certain things and God has to be one of those, because I can't begin to believe that it has to be possible that we could even understand the whole deal if we were told about it. Does that make sense? I now know how little I actually know.

       I find it hilarious that people like you try to bash someone that's Christian for their beliefs and if they are slightly "snarky" you try to bash them.  The hypocrisy is amazing.

       At the end of the day, that is your choice and congrats for making it. But it doesn't make sense to me. Sorry. I used to think I "knew" lots of stuff but that scene from "
Men in Black" where Tommy Lee Jones talks about what you will "know" tomorrow really resonates with me now.

       Can you prove that their is no Jesus, God or Satan? No? Okay. I'm not a follower of religion but I can't dismiss something that can't be proved or debunked. It may or may not be real. Who knows really?

       I'm responding specifically to the idea that "it can't be proven or disproven" as an excuse for believing in something.
      </p>
      <p>
       I didn't take a side on whether or not anything specific exists, I'm pointing out the obvious flaw in this line of thinking.
      </p>
      <p>
       If something exists there should be proof, and if you are attempting to say that this thing exists, you should provide that proof.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not being able to prove it one way or the other is a moot point and doesn't establish anything, certainly not validity.

       I can prove that the Abrahamic god is absolutely evil. Satan makes no sense as the whole ifea of a final battle etc is pointless if god is omnipotent then Satan could have been destroyed at any point.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also wild claims need evidence, not the other way around therefore it's irrelevant whether we can prove god doesn't exist or not. Also there are numerous logical impossibilities for god, like his omnipotence
