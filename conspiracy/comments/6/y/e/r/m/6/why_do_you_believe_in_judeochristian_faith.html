        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;ve noticed a disturbing trend on conspiracy.</p>

<p>a number of &quot;truth advocates&quot; demonstrate a remarkable ability to ignore the past 2000 years of history and act like believing in some &quot;alternative facts&quot; version of The Bible makes them inheritly intellectuallly superior to their peers.</p>

<p>What is actually happening is you are being manipulated by the machine into thinking you have discovered some long lost truth that miainstream christians have either discarded, forgotten about, or willfully fought against!</p>

<p>Don&#39;t be so plebian!  These holy wars have raged on for <strong>thousands of years</strong> and whatever-sea-scrolls you read are nothing new.</p>

<p>There is no nephilem.  There is no Jesus.  There is no God.  </p>

<p>Thinking otherwise is an insult to freedom of thought.</p>

<p>judeo-christian faith</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Looks lile we found the (((commie))) troll.</p>

<p>Christanity is the exact opposite of Judaism. There isna reason why all those BASED Christian kings kicked the kikes out. There is a reason why EVERY fascist movement was backed by Christanity  (Hitler, Codreanu, Mussolini, Franco, etc)</p>

<p>Heck, even the most famous Orthodox Church father (St John Chrysostom) hated Jews.</p>

<p>So cut your (((satanic))) BS and go back to Israel, you fucking kike.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ooh yeah. Personally I try to glean the nice things from the Bible and even from other religions that I feel can help me be a better person, friend, father, teacher, coworker etc. Past that, just believe in something, anything, as long as you have some kind of faith. I see little need to argue over something we can&#39;t possibly ever know until we (maybe) cross the astral plane into some higher reality. Organized religion is a chain of the world&#39;s most devout book clubs at this point. Just be good and the rest doesn&#39;t really matter, right?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your an idiot, you just dogmatically stated there is no God (how do you know, faith I guess) there is no Jesus (can argue his divinity all day, but he is an actual historic figure that existed) and for you to accuse anyone who believe differently than your dogmatic faith is an insult to freedom? You are an insult to this sub, and you just can&#39;t handle your hate for chrsistians. Maybe you were molested by a priest or something or had an abusive parent that was very religous. You have some issues if this is what your focused on, and if you think any way being waged right now is a holy war, your an idiot.  Hell the crusades were not even holy wars. So good luck with your campaign against free thinking.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So free thought allows you to mock those you don&#39;t&#39; agree with? I mean here is the thing to me no matter what you believe and you can believe whatever you want I&#39;m not trying to convince you of anything other than to be more open minded. About the possibility. I mean think about this I believe that it&#39;s totally possible that I couldn&#39;t even comprehend certain things and God has to be one of those, because I can&#39;t begin to believe that it has to be possible that we could even understand the whole deal if we were told about it.
