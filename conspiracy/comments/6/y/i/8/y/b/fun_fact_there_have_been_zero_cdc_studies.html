       Here is the link to the very interesting pilot study, showing that long term health of unvaccinated children is much better than that of vaccinated children. They even control for overall lifestyle. Not conclusive, but it would be great to have more like this, but the CDC refuses.

       Do you get concerned that certain diseases that have been more or less eradicated could come back if we stopped vaccinating.

       Here are my thoughts. Some diseases are more dangerous than others. Am I afraid of a huge chickenpox outbreak? No, not really. Should babies be vaccinated against hepatitis b when it's only spread through sex and dirty needles? Absolutely not. I am highly skeptical of the amount of vaccines required in childhood. I can accept three or four, but twenty or thirty is overkill.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's the issue of vaccine efficacy. For example, polio is mostly spread through fecal matter. The decline in polio seems to strongly correspond with clean water and sanitation. Yes, we have a polio vaccine, but most people aren't really afraid of dysentery or cholera. They are spread in similar ways, yet we aren't scared of the ones that have no vaccine.
      </p>
      <p>
       Natural immunity is always better than vaccine immunity. Natural immunity lasts forever and can also be passed from mother to child. Vaccine immunity wears off after several years. Anecdotal, but many adults I know have not had their booster shots meaning they are not immune anymore. The fact that we don't have major disease outbreaks in these populations that aren't vaccine protected should be something to look at very closely. In areas with measles outbreaks, I'd think there would be a disproportionate amount of adults sick.

       I could get on board with fewer vaccines spread out farther if I researched more about why they do it like that in the first place.

       Natural immunity doesn't really work in modern society though for major diseases it wouldn't seem.

       Too bad your "Fun fact" is a Lie, spread by anti-vaxers. In reality there have been many studies comparing vaccinated vs unvaccinated populations. While it's true we don't stop using highly successful vaccines like the polio to reevaluate, there is plenty of historical data to base studies on. Here are a few examples:

       No, I want to study the children that are already out there who already have philosophical or religious vaccine exemptions. There is nothing unethical about a retroactive study such as that. There are thousands of such children almost every state in the US.

       Yes, I looked at his blog source, which did in fact list some studies. It'll take me a bit of time to go through each one, but I am already seeing serious flaws. For example, some evaluate "mostly vaccinated" populations vs "mostly unvaccinated" populations. Not the same thing. And if they're mostly unvaccinated because they're poor, that could make a difference too.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway let's start specifically with the first study. Since he didn't directly provide the study, I will:
       <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3057555/">
        https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3057555/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Notice that it is a questionnaire, and doesn't actually look at health records. But oh well, it's a start! Let's keep going. Oh look, next I notice that the questions they're asking are things like "has your child had measles?" "Has your child had the croup?" "Does your child get allergies?"
      </p>
      <p>
       They did NOT look at overall health, or things like real chronic illness. Rheumatoid arthritis, chronic inflammatory diseases of the bowel, diabetes, autism, epilepsy, chronic diseases of the respiratory system, nothing like that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Okay so there's one on the blog. I'll go through the rest but I doubt they'll be any better.

       No official studies sure, but lots of evidence like, oh I don't know, the entirety of recorded human history. Child mortality rates since the introduction of vaccinations has dropped dramatically and life expectancy overall has increased a ton. Ever heard of small pox, polio, or tetanus? They are lethal and debilitating diseases that were extremely prevalent among people in the developed world which were very easily contractible. If you want to see what life without vaccinations is like go visit the poorest, least developed areas of Africa.

       Yeah, because I'm sure the child labor laws, the massive increase in nutrition,  indoor plumbing, and people learning about hand washing, had absolutely nothing to do with it.

       Did you know the death rates of pretty much every vaccine preventable illness had dropped to almost zero before the vaccines came out?

       No, what I'm calling for is a retroactive study of health records of children who have religious/philosophical vaccine exemptions. Controlling for major lifestyle choices of course.
      </p>
      <p>
       The kids are out there already and there's nothing unethical about comparing the overall health of the two groups.
      </p>
      <p>
       If vaccines are so safe, then there should be no difference :) In fact, maybe the vaccinated kids will be healthier since they don't have as much disease, right?

       The diagnostic criteria for polio changed around the time of the  vaccine coming out. They started identifying things like "acute flaccid paralysis" instead of polio. These things are still around today, and kids might not be in iron lungs, but that's because we have ventilators.
      </p>
      <p>
       Many cases of polio back then could also be attributed to the massive DDT poisoning from farming practices at the time.
      </p>
      <p>
       And lastly, true polio was already on the decline because of indoor plumbing, people not shitting in the streets, and sanitation.

       Really depends on the disease. For example with chickenpox, yes the vaccine worked, but I would argue that chickenpox is not scary enough to risk adding yet another vaccine to the CDC schedule.
      </p>
      <p>
       Pertussis is still being spread BECAUSE of the vaccine. Even the FDA admitted that the vaccine causes you to potentially carry the pertussis bacteria asymtomatically in your throat for weeks.

       ok im serious here because i never gave this topic much thought.  please bear with me as i like to approach new topics as simply as possible then work my way up as i learn.  so to start i have to ask, how exactly does me getting immunized help you? if i didnt have the vaccine i would get it right? so whats stopping you from getting it from the unknown as well? (assuming you didnt get a vaccine) also isnt there horrible stories of vaccines being contaminated or assembled in normal factories and not clean labs?  idk i just dont trust injections to begin with so i would like to further discuss the topic.

       Good question! The provax answer would be that when enough people are vaccinated, you get
       <strong>
        herd immunity.
       </strong>
       If there are too many unvaccinated people, this increases the chances that the illness will jump from person to person until it gets to A. Someone who was vaccinated but for some reason didn't develop titers. B. A baby or elderly person. C. An immunocompromized person who couldn't be vaccinated.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sounds scary right?
      </p>
      <p>
       Well here's why vaccine induced herd immunity is bullshit.

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       If you're worried about vaccine contamination, you're absolutely right. A lot of people have those same concerns...so many that parents even developed a "hot lots" website to try to track which lot numbers cause the most problems. Not saying it's an accurate website but the concern is there for sure.

       What exactly is the problem with most vaccinated bs mostly not vaccinated seems it would get right at the data you desire.

       Because first of all, what does "mostly" mean? Next, with science you have to control the variables.
       <em>
        Why
       </em>
       is this population "mostly" unvaccinated? Is it the area they live, a socioeconomic thing? That's too many variables. And lastly, like in the study I cited in another comment, what questions are they asking and what health problems are they looking for?
      </p>
      <p>
       If you want people to listen to your study, do it right. Be precise. No "mostly". Control for variables. Look at actual health records. Ask the right questions.

       I would say we should find out what's causing that 1%. Maybe there's kids genetically predisposed to autism, for example, if they get certain vaccines? Maybe the vaccines need to be delayed, or given further apart? Then we could personalize a vaccine plan for each kid. Wouldn't that be great?
      </p>
      <p>
       Or maybe the vaccines are causing that 1% because there is a 1% rate of bad batches. Maybe we could tighten up regulation and make that 1% not happen. Maybe we could repeal the law that makes vaccine companies immune from any liability, which would incentivize the manufacturers to be safer. Wouldn't that be great?
