       I feel obligated to say this...
      </p>
      <p>
       You should know that the hysteria leading up to September 23rd in 2015 is one of the main reasons I joined Reddit.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is even a dedicated sub
       <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/Sep2015Event/">
        here.
       </a>
      </p>

       Here are the coincidences from 2015:

       This is not intended to say that you shouldn't always be prepared.  Have a bug out kit, own a firearm, etc.  All I am saying is that the most likely scenario is that your situation on September 24th will be the same as your situation on September 22nd, so plan accordingly.
      </p>
      <p>
       If an event is to take place it will be more symbolic, and will likely go under the radar much like Agenda 2030 in 2015.
      </p>
      <p>
       Keep your eyes on TPTB the best you can and try not to get distracted too much by Nibiru.  If another celestial body shows up, you will know it.

       It's always around the Fall Equinox. That's the rub. The buildup of energy/fear may somehow be harnessed by the secret societies during that time and the energy may then be sent as an offering to whatever idol they all are worshipping (Moloch, Baphomet, Baal, Marduk, etc.). This is why every year there is this....anticipation.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's done on purpose, year after year.

       I like to at least know the signs around me so I can prepare myself, my family and friends. Even if nothing happen, at least I was prepared instead of going, "Oh shit, what do I do" Then you freak out and mess shit up.

       Yea, I watched youtubes about that. It is okay to look at seasons and stuff and kind of guess what we are coming too. Like you know the mark of the beast, could very well be the RFID chip that gets implanted.

       Perhaps, but as of right now, I would have no clue what that other thing could potentially be.
      </p>
      <p>
       I see the RFID chip as, eventually they will do away with cash and all your information, bank/money included, will be linked to the chip. Since they now say dollar bills are worthless (I'm going to assume, they will try and force us to turn in paper bills because X date and they are rendered useless), we will have to use this chip, like it or not.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, only other thing I can think of, it will become a norm to have a barcode on your head, so when facial recognition software get perfect, they can just scan your head as well to see who you are or check out of a grocery store, like another pay or second check.

       Regardless, those who stay loyal to Christ will not get the Mark of the Beast. But being loyal to Christ means following him and not following a religion or denomination. There is nothing wrong with being part of a denomination right now, but the Spirit will warn us when all the churches and religions of the world will unite to form the one world religion and worship Lucifer and The Beast. When we feel that tug in our hearts, we will know that it is time to follow Christ alone, or with fellow believers who will not kneel to the one world religion and Beast. Even if that means persecution.

        However, only other thing I can think of, it will become a norm to have a barcode on your head, so when facial recognition software get perfect, they can just scan your head as well to see who you are or check out of a grocery store, like another pay or second check.
       </p>

      <p>
       Do you ACTUALLY believe people are going to be ok with having barcodes on their head? Have you not watched/read/followed any science fiction or young adult fiction for the last 20 years?

       No. Rev 13:16 says “And he causeth all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to receive a mark in their right hand, or in their foreheads:”
‭‭
Not all poor people have cell phones, furthermore in remote areas everyone wont have cellphones, and sure a military unit might arrive and slaugher them or round them up but they won't be given cell phones.

       Damascus is the oldest, continually inhabited city mentioned in the prophecy, and it doesn't just say it becomes a ruinous heap - at night it exists, then it the morning it is decimated. Seems to only fit with a major strike. It says Damascus is a ruinous heap and Israel is simultaneously severely hurt, but will continue to be. That type of event hasn't happened yet, but to me is always a major timepiece to begin the other events.

       Yea. I remember the whole 2015 thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       I did actually give in to the hype thinking something was going to happen, not like end of world or anything, but when I looked into it more, I never found a YEAR it was taking about. So about a month before. I felt 100% confident people were spewing fear porn out there.
      </p>
      <p>
       I did know though about the 2017 one, that is matched up. That is the one I followed and believe 100% that constellation will happen, however, I do not believe something major could happen, like end of world like asteroid hitting us.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd more believe it if an asteroid flies by Earth out like 4,000 miles or the next 9/11 may happen, but nothing super duper catastrophic.
      </p>
      <p>
       Next, predictive programming, there is a lot of clues about September 23rd, again, no year, but Revelations 12 does match up.

       I understand everyone's skepticism, dates come and go with nothing happening. But it is folly to ignore the warnings of every single ancient culture. Nemesis is coming, it's just part of life in our system. And sure there's nothing you can do about it, but people like me trying to warn everyone are saying that the things you worry and stress about don't matter and you should be spending this time propagating love for one another :).

       I'm not stating anything will happen, or that nothing will happen. What I am stating is that anyone who believes in the Holy Bible will agree, the blood moon tetrads were noteworthy, them landing on feast days noteworthy, the government agencies movements leading up to it were noteworthy, all of these things have been noteworthy.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, the constellation/celestial alignment that takes place on that day and the things occurring up there that allow it to take place (such as jupiter seemingly hanging in roughly the same spot in the night sky, the womb of Virgo), is likely the most CLOSE TO BIBLICAL prophecy occurring for all to see that we've witnessed in our time. You can debate virtually all other things people claim are prophetic.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another posters list "The war in Syria, Damascus becoming a ruinous heap, the euphrates river drying up, the blood moon tetrad."
      </p>
      <p>
       These things are all profound in their own right, but allow room for them to be chalked up as coincidence. This particular alignment is a direct quote from the Bible and depicts it taking place in the end times. Using software such as Stellarium to view the procession of the celestial bodies above, I recall it being stated this alignment is a one-time thing (haven't verified for those who have/use this software.).

       Since I know that John the Baptist was Sumerian, I know that Jesus inherited his mythology--not the mythology of Jews. The Water of Life is the Styx in Greece, Apzu or Ea in Sumeria. The Zoroastrians, being drinkers of Haoma (Soma), called it Apas. Jesus then had a syncretic belief system that blended Greek, Sumerian, Zoroastrian, Vedic, and Abrahamic ideas together. How did all of this occur? By eating the immortal fruit, as Jesus calls it in the Gnostic Gospels of the Nag Hammadi.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Nag Hammadi is a collection of Gnostic texts that give us only hints at what the Gnostics believed. Judging by the Gospel of Tom, however, we can tell that Jesus was poetic, and clearly in love with a Mary. A close reading of the Nag Hammadi associates Jesus with Christ, and Mary with Sophia, his consort.
      </p>
      <p>
       In all this talk of consorts, we recall the pagan idea of the Gods all being male and female emanations of the transcendent. Jesus, at the end of his prayers, is clearly invoking Amen. By stating Sophia to be his consort, Jesus is alluding to the thought that he and his Mary are divine consorts like Osiris and Isis, the twin serpents of the Sun and the Moon.
      </p>
      <p>
       The eclipse that occurred on August 21st, 2017 was the first one I ever witnessed in my life. As I watched it, I was thinking about all of this, silently humming the Gayatri mantra, and enjoying a micro dose of mushrooms. In my eyes, and the eyes of any Egyptian or occultist, that Sun and Moon were enacting the rite of the Syzygy, as two solar winged serpents.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, back to the Nag Hammadi for a moment. I'm confident in my scholarship that Gnosticism reflects the real beliefs of the Jesus as he lived and died. In my opinion, as a Gnostic Christian, Jesus and his followers (who were once John the Baptist's followers) ate and drank a psychedelic like Soma. With Soma, the Rishi and Rishaka of Golden Age India were able to compose the Vedas and Upanishads. Soma is the tool of mystics, poets, and prophets. Swimming in the Water of Life, and wielding Agni, one feels conducted by powers of prophecy.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Gnostic Gospel, "On the Origin of the Word" concludes with a passage that is quite close to the Revelations 12--except that the symbol of the serpent is not Yaltabaoth, Satan or Yahweh, but the lovers of Christ and Sophia. The descendants of the Incan empire, the shamans of Peru, recognize the authority of two serpents too--Ayahuasca and her consort.
      </p>
      <p>
       Said Gnostic text reads:
&lt;Before the consummation [of the age], the whole place will shake with great thundering. Then the rulers will be sad, [...] their death. Then the age will begin, and they will be disturbed. Their kings will be intoxicated with the fiery sword, and they will wage war against one another, so that the earth is intoxicated with bloodshed. And the seas will be disturbed by those wars. Then the sun will become dark. And the moon will cause its light to cease. The stars of the sky will cancel their circuits.
      </p>
      <p>
       &lt;And a great clap of thunder will come out of a great force that is above all the forces of chaos, where the firmament of the woman is situated. Having created the first product, she will put away the wise fire of intelligence and clothe herself with witless wrath. Then she will pursue the gods of chaos, whom she created along with the prime parent. She will cast them down into the abyss. They will be obliterated because of their wickedness.

       Gnosticism, at least what I have seen online, is disinfo. It identifies God (of whom your soul is a part) as the Demiurge - the "bad guy." This is classic Satanic brainwashing - to make you hate both your Ceator, and yourself. Their 'gospels' are obvious fakes. It's a super evil psyop, of which the Archon thing is a part. It's all a lie. YOU are the 'Archon' - YOUR consciousness is creating all this. They want to make you self destruct by turning you against yourself. Other disinfo: Urantia, Ra Material, Course in Miracles, etc.

       Christianity has no meaning if not interpreted through Gnosticism. You either worship the Demiurge, or Sophia and the Christ. It's the classic dichotomy of Set vs Horus/Osiris/Isis.

       You also misinterpreted the idea of God in the Gnostic texts.
      </p>
      <p>
       God is the transcendent. Sophia is the first emanation from God. 
Yaltabaoth/Demiurge is not God, but an Archon or Daemon who thought he was God--hence the arrogance and blindness of the Yahweh in the Old Testament.

       The New Testament is a sterilization of the Holy Spirit and the Water of Life. The Mysteries are the secrets of our ancestors, hidden away in the immortal fruit. Until Agni and Aban flow, we eat ourselves, tail to tail.

       From what I understand, the Demiurge isn't the true god in gnosticism. The true god is Sophia according to gnostics. This kind of lends to why there's such a drastic tone difference between the old testament and new testament in the Bible. Demiurge is supposed to be the wrathful YHYH or the god speaking to Adam, Moses, etc. And Sophia is the "compassionate god" referenced in the new testament.
      </p>
      <p>
       As such, I find there's some truth to Gnosticism as with every religion out there, and that mainstream Christianity isn't something that should be seen exclusive of others.

       You clearly haven't read any of the Nag Hammadi library, so you're welcome to pretend that you have some an authority here.

       Your idea of religions all having "some truth" is a cop-out extraordinaire. How should we reconcile the fact that every mystic encounters serpents when they ingest psychedelics? What is ignored is the fact that this female serpent entity, Sophia aka Ayahuasca aka Tiamat aka Ma'at has a stake in the human race. It's her aborted son, Yaltabaoth, Demiurge, who is deceiving all of us into believing the narratives of our governments and institutions.

       Stay away from psychedelics. The government didn't distribute 100 million hits of LSD for your benefit. These entities can get into your mind. That's how Aztecs ended up with all the human sacrifice after their obsession with mushrooms. I agree that Ayahuasca and Sophia are probably the same entity - Isis, or Lucifer:

       The Damascus prophecy absolutely hasn't happened yet as I responded above to the same comment. It hasn't been paraphrased correctly. It doesn't become a ruinous heap over the course of a war, and it's endured many battles over the ages. But what hasn't happened is that it exists at night, and the next morning it is no more. Could only be a modern strike. And Israel is badly injured in the exchange, but will continue on. That event triggers a lot of the other events that haven't happened yet.

       If Gnosticism is the reality of Christianity (and it is--I'll debate you on this as much as you would like), then it's been 99 years since Mary/Sophia was seen by three young girls in Portugal. You fans of numerology know this is as good as it gets.

       All of the current world events, it should go without saying.  It's going to get much worse.  We are out of time friend.  Sept 23 the followers of Christ will be raptured and the horrific Tribulation will begin.  Luke says that men's hearts will fail them from the fear that is coming.  NOW is the time to repent we only have two weeks left.  This IS the Biblical end days.  I hope to see you in paradise.  it's all going down

       No, I'm totes about planet X/nibiru/wormwood/nemesis. I just want to know where this date is coming from. But as an archaolgical atheist, I'm all about bible verses. Lots of history to be found. The date Sept 23. I've heard it before. Is the date sept 23 2017 specifically stated as having some significance somewhere?

       The celestial alignment described is a once ever type of thing, with the planets all lining up in a specific area of the sky with certain planets touching/above/under certain constellations. The alignment has never happened before and people say isn't going to happen again. I've seen people post pictures of where all the planets will be and the related bible verses from revelations that describe it all, I couldn't do it without the pics from memory... sorry...

       sept 23 2017 isn't specifically mentioned in verse AFAIK, the celestial alignment that happens that day is what is described.

       This year I'm not as informed about the events as I was in 2015.  I am trying to get up to speed because I do enjoy this stuff.
      </p>
      <p>
       In 2015 there was a bunch of "double sunrise" videos popping up and speculation that the 23rd would be the day of disclosure of alien life.  I think David Wilcock was pushing Nibiru and disclosure at the time.

       What was the basis for 2015 other than "suspicious" events leading to it? Was there a constellation that people mistook for the Rev 12 sign? I never understood the 2015 premise, but the 2017 premise makes a lot more sense. It is also astonishing that it's 33 days after the total eclipse which happened to begin on the 33rd state and end on the 33rd parallel. Perhaps just coincidences. I don't expect the world to be on fire, but I do suspect something will happen shortly after. Only time will tell.
      </p>
      <p>
       And also Nibiru is horseshit invented by Sitchen's mistranslations. I assure you that you don't have to worry about it.

       I think the biggest thing from 2015 was the Shemitah.  It was a particularly significant Shemitah apparently.  Most say it did happen because the stick market did take a record dip but it was in August.
      </p>
      <p>
       Jeff Berwick did a video where he said the word "Shemitah"
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPBtflaJWNY">
        somewhere around 700 times
       </a>
       and that gained some good traction around here.

       Ah I think I remember now. I believe people thought God was supposed to smite the Earth because we didn't respect his Sabbaths or something like that. But Shemitah ends on Sept 13th, not 23rd.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for Nibiru, there are a lot more recent translations of the Sumerian tablets that prove Sitchen was wrong in many things, especially Nibiru.

       That was a post I did recently. Unfortunately people kinda get upset when they realize that they got duped. But I encourage you to do your own research done by academia, and you'll see a pattern.

       What about owning a firearm is stupid?  I suppose you believe they are dangerous? Evil?

       I think if anything it is stupid
       <em>

       to own one.  Although I would be interested to hear a counter argument.

       I see the RFID chip as, eventually they will do away with cash and all your information, bank/money included, will be linked to the chip. Since they now say dollar bills are worthless (I'm going to assume, they will try and force us to turn in paper bills because X date and they are rendered useless), we will have to use this chip, like it or not.

       However, only other thing I can think of, it will become a norm to have a barcode on your head, so when facial recognition software get perfect, they can just scan your head as well to see who you are or check out of a grocery store, like another pay or second check.

       It's always around the Fall Equinox. That's the rub. The buildup of energy/fear may somehow be harnessed by the secret societies during that time and the energy may then be sent as an offering to whatever idol they all are worshipping (Moloch, Baphomet, Baal, Marduk, etc.). This is why every year there is this....anticipation.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's done on purpose, year after year.

       Since I know that John the Baptist was Sumerian, I know that Jesus inherited his mythology--not the mythology of Jews. The Water of Life is the Styx in Greece, Apzu or Ea in Sumeria. The Zoroastrians, being drinkers of Haoma (Soma), called it Apas. Jesus then had a syncretic belief system that blended Greek, Sumerian, Zoroastrian, Vedic, and Abrahamic ideas together. How did all of this occur? By eating the immortal fruit, as Jesus calls it in the Gnostic Gospels of the Nag Hammadi.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Nag Hammadi is a collection of Gnostic texts that give us only hints at what the Gnostics believed. Judging by the Gospel of Tom, however, we can tell that Jesus was poetic, and clearly in love with a Mary. A close reading of the Nag Hammadi associates Jesus with Christ, and Mary with Sophia, his consort.
      </p>
      <p>
       In all this talk of consorts, we recall the pagan idea of the Gods all being male and female emanations of the transcendent. Jesus, at the end of his prayers, is clearly invoking Amen. By stating Sophia to be his consort, Jesus is alluding to the thought that he and his Mary are divine consorts like Osiris and Isis, the twin serpents of the Sun and the Moon.
      </p>
      <p>
       The eclipse that occurred on August 21st, 2017 was the first one I ever witnessed in my life. As I watched it, I was thinking about all of this, silently humming the Gayatri mantra, and enjoying a micro dose of mushrooms. In my eyes, and the eyes of any Egyptian or occultist, that Sun and Moon were enacting the rite of the Syzygy, as two solar winged serpents.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, back to the Nag Hammadi for a moment. I'm confident in my scholarship that Gnosticism reflects the real beliefs of the Jesus as he lived and died. In my opinion, as a Gnostic Christian, Jesus and his followers (who were once John the Baptist's followers) ate and drank a psychedelic like Soma. With Soma, the Rishi and Rishaka of Golden Age India were able to compose the Vedas and Upanishads. Soma is the tool of mystics, poets, and prophets. Swimming in the Water of Life, and wielding Agni, one feels conducted by powers of prophecy.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Gnostic Gospel, "On the Origin of the Word" concludes with a passage that is quite close to the Revelations 12--except that the symbol of the serpent is not Yaltabaoth, Satan or Yahweh, but the lovers of Christ and Sophia. The descendants of the Incan empire, the shamans of Peru, recognize the authority of two serpents too--Ayahuasca and her consort.
      </p>
      <p>
       Said Gnostic text reads:
&lt;Before the consummation [of the age], the whole place will shake with great thundering. Then the rulers will be sad, [...] their death. Then the age will begin, and they will be disturbed. Their kings will be intoxicated with the fiery sword, and they will wage war against one another, so that the earth is intoxicated with bloodshed. And the seas will be disturbed by those wars. Then the sun will become dark. And the moon will cause its light to cease. The stars of the sky will cancel their circuits.
      </p>
      <p>
       &lt;And a great clap of thunder will come out of a great force that is above all the forces of chaos, where the firmament of the woman is situated. Having created the first product, she will put away the wise fire of intelligence and clothe herself with witless wrath. Then she will pursue the gods of chaos, whom she created along with the prime parent. She will cast them down into the abyss. They will be obliterated because of their wickedness.

       The Damascus prophecy absolutely hasn't happened yet as I responded above to the same comment. It hasn't been paraphrased correctly. It doesn't become a ruinous heap over the course of a war, and it's endured many battles over the ages. But what hasn't happened is that it exists at night, and the next morning it is no more. Could only be a modern strike. And Israel is badly injured in the exchange, but will continue on. That event triggers a lot of the other events that haven't happened yet.

       The celestial alignment described is a once ever type of thing, with the planets all lining up in a specific area of the sky with certain planets touching/above/under certain constellations. The alignment has never happened before and people say isn't going to happen again. I've seen people post pictures of where all the planets will be and the related bible verses from revelations that describe it all, I couldn't do it without the pics from memory... sorry...

       If Gnosticism is the reality of Christianity (and it is--I'll debate you on this as much as you would like), then it's been 99 years since Mary/Sophia was seen by three young girls in Portugal. You fans of numerology know this is as good as it gets.
