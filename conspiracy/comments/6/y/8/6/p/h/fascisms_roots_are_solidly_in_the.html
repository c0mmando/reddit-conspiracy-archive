       Hierarchy is not antithetical to the left. It is antithetical to liberty. There are authoritarian and libertarian leftists.

       It came out of the failure of Marxist communism. Fascism was just another flavor of communism. But instead of following Marxist workers revolution paradigm of uniting workers against the higher classes, it looks to control society by uniting the corporations at the top.

       Fascist corporatism. When corporations and the govt work hand in hand to create a centrally controlled utopia.

       Nationalism is a common way that all parties try to rally votes in their elections. Saying that no left wing politicians have ever used nationalism as a political tool, is absurd to the extreme. Ridiculous.
      </p>
      <p>
       It just so happens that the leftist globalists agenda are currently being threatened by various right wing candidates and parties in various countries that are trying to leverage nationalist sentiments to oppose globalization (UK - Brexit, US - Trump, France - Le Pen), you'd be right.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hence, the left trying to equate nationalism with everything bad like NAZIs, KKK, racism, hate, and of course the narrative claims that only racist right wingers are nationalist. Which is complete bullshit.
      </p>
      <p>
       When you are trying to take over the globe, nationalism becomes the enemy. But when you are trying to gain power in individual countries, nationalism is a tool, even for left wingers. Leftists have shown time and time again that they will go to extremes to gain power and to keep it. Virtually every dictatorship in the last 100 years has been left wing and has used nationalism as a political tool to gain or maintain power.

       I think they just don't like naturally occurring hierarchy, it seems like the whole point of socialism is to artificially control the hierarchy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hierarchies exist because some people are more competent than others, some people are more motivated, intelligent, physically attractive, capable etc etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       These hierarchies lead people who deserve to have a position in power, to having it.  Once socialism gets involved and everyone gets a trophy then the competent productive people no longer have any reason to be productive and they fuck off while society suffers from being lead by morons.

       You haven't said a single thing that makes that point. You just keep referring to related concepts. Marxism relies on hierarchies, they're just different forms than the one we're used to.

       "Punch a Nazi" is a distinctly hierarchical movement.  It places white people with decent haircuts at the very bottom of the social ladder.  I would also argue that the whole culture of virtue signalling is nothing more than a developing hierarchy, where one's false sense of victimization improves your social status.

       I was thrown off because what you quote says absolutely nothing about right wing.
      </p>
      <p>
       You quoted "militant nationalism". Has nothing to do with right wing.
      </p>
      <p>
       "authoritarian values" - not right wing. Describes virtually every communist dictatorship though.
      </p>
      <p>
       "opposed the liberal individualism of the enlightenment". That's right. Socialism and communism required the state collective be more important than the individuals that make up the collective
      </p>
      <p>
       "attacked Marxism and other left wing ideologies". The various left wing ideologies fought each other and sometimes Fascism won, as in Italy, sometimes not, as with Quisling in Norway.

       I'm hesitating to even engage with you on this...you do realize that the KKK/Nazi guys in Charlottesville were all about Trump? They chanted his name and Christopher Cantwell specifically praised him.

       My guess is that you're going to say that they were all paid protesters in a mastermind scheme by Soros and the media to draw a larger divide between people? Despite the fact that there is absolutely not a shred of evidence for that theory.

       No. They were on George Soros' payroll. The NAZI/KKK groups came on the same buses as the Antifa group.
      </p>
      <p>
       And there is quite a bit of proof. Jason Kessler, head of one of the supposed Nazi or kkk groups is Jewish and worked for the Democrats for years until he had a convenient white supremacist epiphany at the exact same time that his party failed to get Hillary elected. They tried to pass off a Jewish Democrat as the leader of a kkk/Nazi group. Amateur hour or what.
      </p>
      <p>
       Witnesses saw both groups come off buses that were parked in a row. They came off and were given their appropriate props and off they went.
      </p>
      <p>
       The whole accident where a protestor was allegedly killed was staged. Multiple videos online shows just how sketchy the whole thing was.
      </p>
      <p>
       You'd think with all of Soros' money they could put together a more credible performance than this highschool level production.

       Kessler was a member of the Occupy movement, sure. Otherwise you have no proof of the rest. No evidence at all. You just choose to believe it because it supports the narrative that you already ascribe to.
      </p>
      <p>
       To review, zero proof Soros is involved. Zero evidence Kessler is Jewish. Zero evidence Kessler supported Hilary. Zero evidence that both protest groups showed up on the same bus. And finally, zero evidence that the act of terrorism was staged.

      <p>
       Now that a supermajority is needed to pass legislation (which is a bullshit problem created by BOTH parties), that isn't really as true a point as it once was.

       Having control of the branches of government doesn't mean you can actually pass legislation.

       The issue with Facism is there is several different definitions, so assigning it to a brand of politics is difficult.  You have economic fascism which Mussolini used and authoritarian fascism which the Nazi's used.  At this point both the left and right use it and label each other to divide and polarize the nation.

       No. They were on George Soros' payroll. The NAZI/KKK groups came on the same buses as the Antifa group.
      </p>
      <p>
       And there is quite a bit of proof. Jason Kessler, head of one of the supposed Nazi or kkk groups is Jewish and worked for the Democrats for years until he had a convenient white supremacist epiphany at the exact same time that his party failed to get Hillary elected. They tried to pass off a Jewish Democrat as the leader of a kkk/Nazi group. Amateur hour or what.
      </p>
      <p>
       Witnesses saw both groups come off buses that were parked in a row. They came off and were given their appropriate props and off they went.
      </p>
      <p>
       The whole accident where a protestor was allegedly killed was staged. Multiple videos online shows just how sketchy the whole thing was.
