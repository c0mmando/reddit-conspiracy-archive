<p>Let&#39;s imagine that if the kurds started expanding their territory in the middle east and began butchering villages of other ethnic groups they could easily point to hundreds of times when they were killed for no reason besides who they were</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Totaly agree. I&#39;m Polish, one of my grandfathers during WWII was forced labor in a coal mine after being caught in the resistance.  The other one once the USSR took over confiscated his lands for owning too much and imprisioned him. One grandma sent to Kazakstan to work the fields. The other escaped any wrongness.</p>

<p>I could be pissed at both countries, or move on. I&#39;ve dated two German descent women. Amazing people. If I was stuck in hatred. I&#39;d never experience that good in my life.</p>

<p>Jewish groups have amazing communities and support. They help each other to get ahead in the world. Instead of blasting them we should strive to make our communities as strong. Learn from others.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Our enemy isn&#39;t actually the Zionists. At all. It&#39;s what is being accused of them - lust for power, control, greed, dehumanization of people and the like are the enemies. They don&#39;t do &quot;jew magic&quot; and have their orders magically carried out, it&#39;s the willing participation of the majority of the society. It&#39;s the acknowledgment of the game. </p>

<p>You think racism, hatred and the desire for a &quot;pure race&quot; is only for the Zionists to believe? No, but these are our enemies too. We can&#39;t answer racism with racism or hatred with hatred, well only rebrand the oppression with our own, which is why I think it&#39;s foolish to cry jews or Zionism or blame this race or that one. It&#39;s our minds, our perspective that shapes reality. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Probably because their countries are being destroyed by war and displacing millions. If their countries/cities were more habitable, then I&#39;m sure there&#39;s no reason for them to be immigrants. Now when you mix radically different beliefs, there&#39;s going to be conflict. I&#39;ve read and seen the news on what these people are doing and find it disturbing, but again it&#39;s about the act itself. It&#39;s not only found in a specific race. We shouldn&#39;t be sensitive about their beliefs if they&#39;re enforcing them on to others with violence. It should be stopped and those people should be held accountable. Just like any other human that perpetrates these sorts of crimes. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, you are right.  I have been telling people that for a while.  Look at Central and South America.  The people there are not allowed to build the lives that they want.  The Cabal, who controls the CIA, go in and steal their natural resources and enslave the native people.  The native people want a better life, but they have to leave their home country, and many illegally immigrate to the U.S.  </p>

<p>If we stop interfering with other countries, then the immigration problem goes away, but that will not happen.  </p>

<p>The Cabal is driven by greed and a hatred of humanity.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ah, I see. Do you think its possible that there is a group of people, who happen to be Jewish, who control most of the positions of power in the US and Israel and support Jewish supremacy at the expense of the goyim, etc?</p>

<p>Let&#39;s just assume you believe this to be true (you may not and that&#39;s fine). Could you be against this group without being against all Jews? Personally, I&#39;ve known many Jewish people and some of them were extremely nice, good people. I don&#39;t consider myself anti-semitic because I don&#39;t judge a Jewish person just because they&#39;re Jewish. I have certainly been accused of being anti-semitic for things like questioning the official narrative of the Holocaust and WW2. I may be anti-Zionist, or whatever you want to call them, though. Does that make sense?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If that&#39;s what you think, so be it. It really doesn&#39;t matter one way or the other. Personally, I think labeling someone as a racist for the beliefs I laid out above is pretty lazy and stupid way of thinking. I&#39;m not sure how anything I said could be characterized as being based on my own racial superiority. I think &quot;racist&quot; is just a thought-terminating buzzword that has been firmly implanted into impressionable young minds like your own by the media.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, but the foreign powers resisted relocation.  The Final Solution was much more sinister.  If Hitler had gone after the international bankers instead of the poor Jews, then his place in history would be very different. Hitler captured a Rothschild, but ransomed him.  That was a mistake.

    <div class="md"><p>I think the problem is that many of them follow the Talmud. From my perspective, the Talmud is less a religious book and more a book to be followed in order for Jews to control and mold society solely for their benefit, and at the expense of all us goyim.</p>

<p>Through their tribal nepotism, they control the top level positions of the media, Hollywood, banking, and politics. With control of these levers of power, they are able to influence the thinking of most of the general populace very easily. And they introduce degeneracy and other things harmful to the fabric of society, not to mention plundering our wealth through interest and inflation.</p>

<p>Certainly not all Jews are in on this game, but those who are in on the game are mostly Jewish.</p>
