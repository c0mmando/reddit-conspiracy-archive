       You can hack anything.

       The AI bots have taken over the internet to manipulate our minds. Why pay shills to push propaganda when you can launch an army of subtle propaganda bots with very human like responses to flood social media and reddit and control the narrative while presenting the illusion of public consensus.

       That very true. They def use all forms of social media to push agenda. Also i know this sounds crazy but i swear things i talk about often end up on my timeline. I asked my gf while on reddit "whatever happened to Marissa Tomei?" And i swear about 48 hours she was appearing multiple times on my reddit feed. And hers.

       Well just recently fb had some AI that appeared to communicate with another AI in a way that a human wouldn't understand or decipher. That's just what they decided to report on. Who knows what they or anybody else hasn't reported.
      </p>
      <p>
       AI could be a literal god before you or I die. Once we start letting a learning system flourish and expand how it sees fit who knows what could happen? That's why Musk and others want to make sure we have the proper rules set in place before we try to hatch a dragon.
      </p>
      <p>
       Imagine what AI could do for traffic if we all had connected cars. It could potentially turn a logistical nightmare into a breezy ride home. Imagine if AI handled all the harvesting and processing on a farm to maybe bring higher yields at a lower cost. Imagine AI picking your kids up for school. It would change society but what would happen if it suddenly decided that serving primates wasn't the most constructive and beneficial way to spend its power? All this is just speculation but you get the idea.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can't rule the crazy shit out so the best thing to do is prepare for it.

       My guess is that 'it' will continue to brainwash the masses just as it is now. Only now the formula seems to have been effectively proven enough times in order for the "handlers" to kick it up a notch.
      </p>
      <p>
       IMHO most of this is done via media (Internet, TV, movies, gaming, etc.; ) and other invisible technology that we already know exists but will get you thrown into the looney bin if you openly discuss it. And now it seems via security breeches or voluntary sharing or just by combined efforts towards a common goal, the power is in the hands of many more than it was before.

       The  common fear is ,as soon as AI cares about its own survival, its going to compete with humanity and secure  the same limited resources for its self that humans need.....it is after all ,what every  sucsesful life form does and easily argue, its the most intelligent species-centric strategy for survival.

       Rare is the day when a billionaire who could potentially invest in and make bank in the field is actively promoting strict government regulation of that field, but such are the unknown hazards and unprecedented nature of AI development. Considering us going out of our way to create consciousnesses more intelligent and capable than our own is one thing-- couple this with automation, cybernetics, drones, how locked in everyone is to the increasingly-botted internet for basic information and social interaction, all the money up for grabs in all this. All part of an increasingly grim picture in which basic humanity and notions like empathy feel increasingly fossilized. Almost like science fiction writers have always been right, and we've been right to fear their ideas.

       Probably an advanced extraterrestrial robotic/alien race that has already begun infusing with us and will soon control all of our computer systems as well.

       I'm surprised you remember :). Let's just say I've had a change of pace, or am a very gullible conspiracy theorist. But joking aside, I am not arguing one way or the other. I would love further confirmations of yours for the globe model. We can continue via pm if you wish. My main problems with the globe model concern what I perceive to be a very real fakery of space images which doesn't make sense given the number of satellites and cameras in orbit capable of taking full-disk images, the lack of demonstrable curvature whether on land or by plane (seeing stuff over-the-horizon), as well as thought experiments like the atmosphere rotating perfectly with the earth (and faster as you go higher up the air column).

       I would be interested to hear your response on what I think we were talking about last: the trig/geometry of the Earth/Moon system which anyone can observe.
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6yb5im/predicting_the_moons_inclination_from_different/">
        I made a post about this here
       </a>
       because I couldn't get anyone in the flat earth subs to respond to it and I have no life.
      </p>
      <p>
       Seems to me it is entirely possible to prove the Earth is round without relying on images from space at all.

       It's not really anything specific, we've always known AI is going to rule the future. From replacing low level jobs to being integrated into our daily lives (cars, research, optimizing almost everything, etc.) to its vast military uses which is the real kicker.
