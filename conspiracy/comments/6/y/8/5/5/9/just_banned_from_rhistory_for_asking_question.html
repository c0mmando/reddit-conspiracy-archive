       Here is my original post, "Why do we ignore the international banking cartels (Rockefellers, Rothschilds) and the fact that they obviously fund both sides of almost every war? It seems like we always look to find the cause of tyranny and war, when in reality we've been ignoring the real answer that sits right in our faces.
The most obvious piece of evidence is the sinking of the Lusitania. It was so blatantly an attempt to gain citizen support of sending troops to Europe. Before the Lusitania was sunk, virtually all Americans were opposed to joining the war. Afterwards millions volunteered.

      </p>
      <p>
       I didn't spread any rumors or agendas, I simply stated a fact followed by a question. I was banned within two minutes of posting this. Who knew the Rothschilds even controlled r/history?

       Yes, that is what they said in a message to which I replied, "How exactly does my post violate rules 2 and 3? Rule two, in summary, prohibits posters from getting political and establishing any kind of "agenda" My post was about a piece of history, banks and banking families to be exact, not politics. Neither was piece trying to further any kind of agenda. I was simply trying wrap my head around the fact that there are events that unfolded in HISTORY, which have changed the world but are ignored entirely.
Rule three prohibits posters from posting about misunderstood or misrepresented history. Nothing is misunderstood on my part, I know the facts and I was inquiring the users of r/history to see if any could fathom why such historical facts would be taught no where. These facts are not taught in schools or universities anywhere. They have no representation at all. How can something be misrepresented if there is in fact no representation?"

       Yup this was their response to my message, inquiring of my suspension, "No, we're simply saying that narratives that are anti-semitic conspiracy theories aren't welcome here. Do not message us again." 
Not once in my post did I mention anything that has anything to do with the Jewish religion. Fuck them seriously.

       You posted nothing about jews, yet they ban you for "anti-semitism".  That is all the proof you need for the fact that elite jews
       <em>
        do
       </em>
       have immense power in the world -- eg, running international banking, Establishment press and media, Hollywood, etc.  And they even have power to censor posters on Reddit you get close to talking about them.

       Over the past 10 years or so, I have been banned from so many forums, for talking about the NWO and jewish power.  Censorship is one of those things that enrages me.  But the truth wins in the end.  Their censorship will not defeat us.  It only makes me fight harder.  And it only puts up a gigantic red flag to others, causing them to investigate the things that we are talking about.

       There is no more "historical debate". They feed us facts and expect us to absorb them like some kind of obedient dog. They want us to sit, jump and roll over at their command without even thinking about it.

       The point of the sub is to get sourced explanations for historical events. I'd wager that if the phrasing were something more like; "Is it true that the Rockefeller and Rothschild families funded both sides of several wars?" or, "What were the possible political reasons for the sinking of the Lusitania?" OP would have gotten some answers rather than a ban.

       That's a bit tautological, isn't it?

       Starting with the assumption that it's 'misunderstood or misrepresented' is exactly the problem. The idea that some form of Official
       <sup>
        TM
       </sup>
       history is inherently correct to the point where it can't be questioned is dangerous.

       Well your thesis was, basically, all wars are banker's wars but then you used the lusitania as proof of this, and pretty weakly. It's common knowledge the lusitania was used to garner support for the war, which you correctly pointed out, but you failed to link it at all to the bankers.

       why not point out the American Industrialists supporting Hitler and then playing both sides as the conflict began in earnest?

       That's exactly why I used the Lusitania, because it is widely known as a hoax. I admit the argument was rather poor and written in a hurry, I definitely could've better pointed out the connection to the bankers.

       I don't think you would have if you took the time to create a good, organized post. That r/ is full of very smarts so, honestly, you should have known better.

       Here's a screenshot of the ban message.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, the fact that I even mentioned Rockefeller and Rothschild in a negative tone led to them banning me for "anti-Semitic conspiracy theories". It doesn't matter how well written an argument I could have wrote, I still would've been banned for criticizing elite international bankers who happen to be Jewish.

       Woah man, I don't see anything about them accusing you of anti-semitism. I think it's putting the cart before the horse here to just assume that's the basis of them banning you like this.
      </p>
      <p>
       Still though, I'm with you in thinking this ban was a bad reaction. Again, I would have removed your post as a Mod, but I would have requested you try again. If you were spamming shit posts in this vein, I could get the ban, but you weren't.

       Well, shit. If the OP above was your original post, and it didn't actually include the words "Jews" or whatever, this is indeed alarming.
      </p>
      <p>
       I too am fucking sick of being called anti-semitic for being against israeli apartheid. I'm shocked that just mentioning Rothschild now makes us anti-semitic too. They're just bankers and everyone hates the bankers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Especially when I'm on here battling holocaust deniers and reminding people of how oppressed the Jews actually were throughout history. I just wish you had a better post that got removed. This could have had legs.

       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       That's why they banned you. You are using buzzwords that have a history of anti-Semitic uses (whether you mean it that way or not) and have nearly no support among academic historians. That's an academic sub that has those rules precisely for your kind of post. That's not a personal affront, but just a description of who they are and how they roll.
      </p>
      <p>
       The tone was also pretty combative.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Why do we ignore the international banking cartels (Rockefellers, Rothschilds) and the fact that they obviously fund both sides of almost every war? It seems like we always look to find the cause of tyranny and war, when in reality we've been ignoring the real answer that sits right in our faces. The most obvious piece of evidence is the sinking of the Lusitania. It was so blatantly an attempt to gain citizen support of sending troops to Europe. Before the Lusitania was sunk, virtually all Americans were opposed to joining the war. Afterwards millions volunteered.

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       That suggests that historians were "ignoring" and missing an obvious answer "right in our faces". In a sub designed for people that don't know the answer to ask academic historians (or enthusiasts) you came claiming to know and implying the academic subject they love is flawed and misleading. Seriously, what did you expect? Know your audience.

       Lol no shit? I don't think it's actually that unlikely he would have considering there could only be so many ocean liners going back and forth back then... But a fun fact indeed.

       He is apparently suspected to be the spymaster responsible for the Lusitania getting sunk. He supposedly infiltrated German occult groups who used them as fronts for spy operation. He supposedly leaked the fact that the Lusitania had munitions on it to these groups.

       I hear ya.  i have had multiple interactions with the mods at r/history and they all went just like yours did.  they will refuse any type of discussion and will immediately mute and or ban you for simply and politely asking them questions.  they've are  impossible to deal with!

       It's sad that mentioning a specific family and their atrocities over many centuries results in a ban. Using the term anti semetic is offensive to use in this situation and waters the term down for when it is being used correctly. 
But I guess mods gotta have a cover for their censorship.

       that sub is like wikipedia, you need official sources for everything. and would the rothschilds who own all the sources allow them to print or report anything making them look bad, no. All of history is full of conspiracies but that sub doesn't allow discussion of them.

       You asked a loaded question. You should ask 'What role have international banking cartels played in wars?' You basically said bankers are the source of wars which many historians probably don't agree with.
      </p>
      <p>
       There have been wars that had to do with debts and money. And wars where tons of money was lost. You went into your question in 100%
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       mode and then asked a conspiracy subreddit why they didn't agree with you. Maybe because not everyone agrees with the theory you're pushing, and a lot of people who blame everythin on the Rothschilds come from some weird anti-Semitic position.

       It doesn't seem like you're asking a question about history. You're asking why people today ignore something you assume to be true.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you asked a question about banking involvement in the Lusitania you probably would have gotten an answer, and a well sourced one at that. But really the only question you ask would be better geared toward a modern sociology sub.

       Don't posit your conclusion in your question.  Don't ask them to answer a non historical question.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your question as framed is really "Why do
       <em>
        we
       </em>
       ignore..."  You are asking historians why they are ignoring something, not about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also you cite the Lusitiania but fail to link it to your thesis.  The Lusitania was propagandized, and we lied about her cargo and used it as an causus belli.  But none of those facts link it to banking cartels.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ethical historians approach history based on the documentary (which these days includes video, audio, etc, but used to be only books and letters) evidence.  Any conclusions drawn need to be directly supported.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you want historians to answer your question you first have to ask what actual evidence exists.  Setting aside your question about why they are "ignoring" something, you need to restructure your question.
      </p>
      <p>
       To get to the heart of your question, you seem to want a discussion of how international banking drives military conflict.  So you should structure your question something like this:
      </p>
      <p>
       "The wars of the 20th century were on an industrial scale never before seen in human history.  To what extent did commerce, international financial institutions and major industrial concerns drive the military build ups that contributed to the scale of the warfare in World War I and II?"
      </p>
      <p>
       "There are numerous examples of groups profiting from and driving both sides of the major military conflicts of the last century.  For instance,
       <a href="http://greatwarproject.org/2015/07/20/a-clear-case-of-trading-with-the-enemy/">
        German and Allied forces traded military supplies with each other during the first World War, exchanging rubber for high-grade optics
       </a>
       .  And
       <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/nazis/readings/sinister.html">
        Switzerland profited during World War II acting as a middle-man for financial transactions with the Reich
       </a>
       .  Texaco essentially gave free oil to Franko during the Spanish Civil War, contributing to the fall of the Republican government."
      </p>
      <p>
       "How widespread was the corporate abetting of military conflict in the last century and based on historical trends are corporations and financial concerns increasingly driving conflict today?"

       The point of the sub is to get sourced explanations for historical events. I'd wager that if the phrasing were something more like; "Is it true that the Rockefeller and Rothschild families funded both sides of several wars?" or, "What were the possible political reasons for the sinking of the Lusitania?" OP would have gotten some answers rather than a ban.
