<p>Absolutely. This was just covered last night by Rachel Maddow: </p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Klan&#39;s historic political ambition finds foothold with Trump</strong></p>

<p>Rachel Maddow looks back at how the Ku Klux Klan flexed its muscles in national American politics in the 1920s and how those same racist political ambitions are finding accommodation with Donald Trump.</p>

<p>it seems you want people who arent racist to hate democrats, because you hate racists but ALSO hate democrats?</p>

<p>seems like a strange tactic for a normal person to take. do you think people smarter than you are fooled by this? that 100+ years ago the names of parties/what they stood for were different?</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>segregation was ended by Republicans</p>
</blockquote>

<p>False. There were far more Democrats than Republicans who voted for an end to segregation.  The opposition to Civil Rights was found among southern conservatives. </p>

<p><strong>Votes for Civil Rights Act of 1964</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>In the US House of Representatives: 152 Democrats, 138 Republicans. </li>
<li>In the US Senate: 46 Democrats, 27 Republicans. </li>
</ul>

<p>What&#39;s really remarkable here is that there were <em>any</em> votes in favor of the legislation. The GOP was a much more liberal party in 1964. The vote would not go the same way if it was held today.</p>

<p>This is the vote by party and region: </p>

<p><strong>The original House version:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Southern Democrats: 7–87   (7–93%)</li>
<li>Southern Republicans: 0–10   (0–100%)</li>
<li>Northern Democrats: 145–9   (94–6%)</li>
<li>Northern Republicans: 138–24   (85–15%)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The Senate version:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Southern Democrats: 1–20   (5–95%) (only Ralph Yarborough of Texas voted in favor)</li>
<li>Southern Republicans: 0–1   (0–100%) (John Tower of Texas)</li>
<li>Northern Democrats: 45–1   (98–2%) (only Robert Byrd of West Virginia voted against)</li>
<li>Northern Republicans: 27–5   (84–16%)</li>
</ul>

    <div class="md"><p>Nobody has ever credited the political direction change to JFK/RFK, hell they tried everything they could to reverse the civil rights movement that was building in popularity, they even called the freedom riders and begged them not to go forward with the rides, i&#39;d go as far as saying that JFK wanted to and would have ignored the situation for as long as possible, he viewed the civil rights movement as a thorn in his side.</p>

<p>Presidentially, the road swap that&#39;s being discussed has always been credited to LBJ who was a democrat that passed two &quot;significant&quot; civil right bills (significant because he actually got the support needed to pass them, not because they did anything overly great), so &quot;the solid south&quot; felt abandoned by their own party for caring about minorities all of sudden, and the republicans came in with candidates like Goldwater and things like &quot;the southern strategy&quot; and all of a sudden the people who voted blue in 1960 were voting red in 1968, (1964 doesn&#39;t count because nearly everyone voted blue out of fear of nuclear war) even the numbers in post why do you think they end in 1968? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>&lt;Well, they have been aligned for generations now, seeing as the parties flipped around 1960s IIRC.</p>

<p>This is exactly what we&#39;re taught in school, which is simply not true. The parties did not just flip out of nowhere and decide they completely changed their values. </p>

<p>&lt;Trump has shown a dislike of minorities, which coincides with his choice to flip to the republicans</p>

<p>Once again, not true. The MSM has perpetuated the myth that Trump &quot;dislikes&quot; minorities. If you know anything about him you know that he has black friends, Hispanic friends, and friends of other &quot;minorities&quot;. He also did not consider himself a Republican until he decided to run for president. Also you&#39;re grossly generalizing all Republicans by saying that they coincide with &quot;disliking minority&#39;s&quot; (way to show your brainwashing/bias).</p>

<p>&lt;That being said, I&#39;ve seen plenty of racist democrats and plenty of accepting, tolerant republicans, so political party affiliation is not the ultimate determiner of values</p>

<p>While you are correct in saying that political party affiliation is not the ultimate determiner of values, the MSM and just about everyone else <em>wants</em> you to think it is. Most people would consider the Republicans as the &quot;less progressive&quot; more &quot;old fashioned&quot; party, while most people think of Democrats as very &quot;progressive&quot; and more &quot;modern&quot;. This is the way they want it to be. </p>

<p>Lord, you can&#39;t even quote me properly.  Trump has shown a great bias against minorities, and the &#39;friends&#39; argument is one of the weakest I have seen in a while.  If not racism, what was Trump&#39;s purpose in the New York 5 case after a ruling had been put out?</p>

<p>&quot; there are companies that exist whose only purpose is to provide crowds for events&quot; - therefore, the majority of the people who attend Trump speeches are paid to be there. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Think whatever you want but what I said is 100% verifiable fact. Is it possible that there are people trying to stoke the flames, but that doesn&#39;t change the fact that there are real white supremacists in this country, be they KKK or neo-nazi and many of them are vocal about their support for Trump. Sure, you can believe that the democrats are the real KKK supporters while they push for laws and policies that the KKK fundamentally hate but imo that is stupid when you look at the recent Republican laws and policies they have been pushing that happen to line up with fundamental KKK views. But no in your mind, the KKK love Hilary, gay marriage, healthcare as a right, making Christians make cakes for gay couples, legal weed, no border wall, easier path to citizenship, promoting diversity, more non whites in positions of authority, ending laws and policies that put a disproportionate amount of black people in jail for non-violent crime and a myriad of other things that counter the KKK&#39;s fundamental values. Makes a lot of sense.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s well known. What&#39;s the conspiracy? I never understand why people point this fact out. They always seem to want to try and prove that republicans are not racist because the KKK was part of the Democratic party like it has some bearing on what is going on today. In my opinion all it does is make Democrats look good. They were racist but they decided it was wrong and came to their senses and now they don&#39;t act racist and fought for civil rights. Republicans on the other hand were the party of Lincoln who freed the slaves, now they are thinking better of it and the party is full of white supremacists? Seems like the Democrats are a lot more reasonable to me.</p>
