       What's 23.10 and you'll find most users on this sub are against religion or are atheists. Mental illness is passed down in genes and if something he read here triggered him or not it was only a matter of time before something triggered his illness. Be thankful it's been caught in time and he can get the treatment he needs.

       I don't know, it just seems like not many people take it seriously or even bothered to comment on it. The posts aren't being deleted, they just aren't really getting much interest. There are doomsday predictions every few months, this one feels like more of the same.

       Maybe I missed something then, because the post I read was still super vague with stuff like "nations in turmoil" and other stuff that could apply to a thousand different points in history. Do you have a link to a good summary?

       Okay, so how does that match up perfectly? That's the kind of vague mumbo-jumbo I was talking about. Maybe the lines about the woman with the sun and moon could be the eclipse, but it says she is clothed with the sun and the moon is beneath her feet. That doesn't sound like an eclipse to me. And the rest of the lines don't really point to any specific time or events as far as I can tell. So why are people getting September 23 out of this?

       Huh, okay that does make a bit more sense than the eclipse. Still seems like trying to force a comparison though. Kinda like the Mayan calendar apocalypse, or whatever the several dozen since then were based on. I certainly won't be doing anything out of the ordinary on the 23rd.

       While intriguing, it isn't that the bible predicted it.  An example would be, what if it happens again in the future - maybe the prediction was that time and not this time.

      <p>
       If you are religious, you know that it says people won't know the hour or the day when things are reset.
      </p>
      <p>
       For those that are religious, these are very interesting times.  Storms, war talk, Israel/Jerusalem issues, stars, Niburu/PlanetX.

       This sub talks about it often.  If you want to know more, search for any of the September 23rd threads, or goto youtube and search for 'September 23 Revelation 12'.  nothing is being suppressed here about this.

       Supposedly there is a big event coming on September 23rd. It's a wonder you guys haven't seen it on the forum. Quite a few posts here and there about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regardless.... Buddy got some nerve saying it's "our" fault.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe he has mental issues that no one has picked up on.. and it seems as per the usual, a loved one of someone in poor mental state is throwing blame around vs understanding it's in fact the persons mental strength. You can't help what someone is willing to believe. You can't help mental disorders.... and you sure as hell shouldn't be placing blame on anyone else. No one MADE him do anything.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe the family wasn't a strong enough support group - if you're placing blame ... start there.

       I'm sorry you had to deal with that. However, this is a place of discussion, not consensus.  You'll typically find people skeptical of a theory in every thread.
      </p>
      <p>
       When everything is a lie, what is truth?  The MSM lies and obfuscates on a daily basis.  Finding the truth is a personal journey fraught with pitfalls.  It takes willpower to not get too wrapped up in any given issue. If he had poor mental health then it's understandable.

       Eh, I don't even know your brother but thanks for blaming me!  I actually hope he's okay though despite your need to accuse me of causing his situation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Btw, it's 23rd of September, not October.  I am glad he has found Jesus although if he is attacking people maybe he needs to read a bit more about Jesus' teachings.  And maybe his brother shouldn't be so quick to judge him either.  Giving everything you own to the poor is an incredibly selfless thing to do even if most people think it's crazy (which I don't).
      </p>
      <p>
       You might pick a better username also.  Might show a bit more respect to your brother's beliefs.

       It sounds like your brother is suffering from some sort of mental illness.  Blaming strangers on the internet won't help him.  But I get it if you're angry and need to blow off some steam.  I sincerely hope your brother gets the help he needs.

       OP, do you mean the September 23rd Revelation 12 prophecy?  Lot sense of Christians feel this is the big one, rapture time.
