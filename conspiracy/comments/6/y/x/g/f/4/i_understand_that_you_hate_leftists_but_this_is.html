       That works to a certain extent. Until someone tries to impose on your rights then people complain. Unfortunately someone will always be butthurt about something so it's not good to ignore the small problems because then they grow big.

       If I'm conservative I'm not going to capitulate to your opinion on what is good for everyone (both left and right) because your opinion on what is good and mine are going to differ drastically.

       Yes stand up for what you believe in that affects you directly . When you lesrn stand up for something that you believe in that affects others and not you directly, that's when you know you've progressed.

       It's only logical what hate groups like the Kkk want, wouldn't you say? It's all good right because if you're white(not saying that you are) at least they don't hate you. Now paint yourself on the other side of the picture and make it so that it was the Kkk persecuting you and your existence. If you're a rational human being you wouldn't feel very good about it.

       I am white but you're ignoring the fact that people call everyone a Nazi or KKK these days.  If they have view that aren't 2017 liberal then they are a Nazi.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's the problem with hate speech laws and why they don't work.  Who gets to define them?  What bingo game of hate do you have to complete before they call you a Nazi and ban everything you say?
      </p>
      <p>
       And yes whiteness matters is the sense that it seems acceptable for people to talk ahit about white people like MTVs "new year's resolutions for white people" video, but similar shit talking about almost any other group is pounced upon by activists and lawsuits and strictly forbidden.  So in that sense are these hate speech laws you propose going to actually be applied with the blindfolds of Justice firmly tied around one's eyes? Or are they going to be a continuation of people saying "you can't be racist towards white people because... Privileged + power... Yada yada"?
      </p>
      <p>
       Who gets to define these terms?
      </p>
      <p>
       Does /shitredditsays get to define it?  Does /the_donald get to define it?  Does Kim Jong Un, Fidel Castro, Adolf Hitler, Jesus Christ, Yahweh, Mount Vesuvius or the magic 8 ball get to define it?
      </p>
      <p>
       Who exactly gets to define it?

       The Constitution, is really just solidifying Natural Law. I'm not saying: "throw the baby out with the bath water", I'm saying something got to give. Each state was really supposed to be it's own country, hence why each state has a constitution. The Federalists really done fucked that all up, though. I think Sovereign City States would probably be the best immediate solution.

       No...  I think that in a globalized community, there needs to be a unified representation of the states to achieve what's best for the aggregate welfare of the United States.  Of course, it's possible that the power of those indicidual states infringes upon what's best for the population of each state...  Either way, I'm a little tipsy and I really just want to read your reply in the morning.
Maybe it depends on how transiet the population can be within each state.  But really, I think that welding together all the states gives better leverage in the international community, and that's better for the whole of the states, even if it's at the detriment of other states (states in this context meaning both the governments of other countries and the individual states that comprise the US).  I hope that made sense.

       Fuck, if people just learned the smallest amount of mind your own damn business, the world would be a better place over night. Why are people obsessed with what other people do? I can't stand people, and I don't wanna know anything about them. Shit like People magazine just grosses me the fuck out. I could not be less interested in the goings on of people's lives.

       No, the far right wants to continue living in the 1950s. The far left us about progressing into the future. Huge difference. Religion is baloney, and it's what the right holds so dearly. If you don't know that then you might as well just raise your ass up and get fucked by it.

       You ignore the other extreme, which is that far left ideology results in collectivist totalitarianism.  Both extremes are just sides of the same statist coin.  Equality is a lie, nature, science and biology are inherently unequal.   Egalitarianism and meritocracy is closer to what you're talking about.  Plenty of right-wingers are not religious, too.

       There is no logical, or moral reason why hate speech should be legal, period. Even though they're not being hateful towards you at the moment doesn't mean someone is not going to come around and hate speech the fuck out of you in the future.

       Then you do NOT Support free speech or even understand how it works.
      </p>
      <p>
       The moment you Support criminalizing any speech then you open the door for some asshole to redefine what hate speech is and the slope keeps on slipping.

       Well sorry to tell you but that slippery slope that you talk about has already happened in history and it was not good. Why as human beings can we not learn from history and why must we continue to make the same mistakes?

       Hatred =/= free speech. It seems like what people say when they talk about free speech in this way is that "I want to hate people, disrespect them and say what I want about them with no repercussions". Now to criminalize it? That's not necessarily the way to go. Laws can be subverted and abused when it's ambiguous like that. Definitely worth a discussion.

       What are your lines on freedom of speech?  Do you have any?  This isn't meant to be antagonist, I'm simply aiming to understand.
