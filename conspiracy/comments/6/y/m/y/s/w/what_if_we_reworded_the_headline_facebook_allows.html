       Private citizen? Good thing he didn't invite two senior campaign officials to attend the meeting.
      </p>
      <p>
       Oh, wait.
       <a href="http://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/read-donald-trump-jr-s-just-released-email-chain-russia-meeting/">
        He did.

      <p>
       Moreover, that email is absolutely evidence that the Russian government meddled, since it offered information. It's not clear how effective this particular attempt was, but that's a separate issue. You're also accepting at face value claims made by meeting participants that nothing resulted from the meeting.

       The email states that this "private Russian citizen" met with a
       <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2017/07/russian-crown-prosecutor/533295/">
        high-level lawyer in the Russian government
       </a>
       to discuss the offer of information from the Russian government to the Trump campaign.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nobody from the meeting has disputed the facts presented in the emails, they only claim that nothing resulted from the meeting.
      </p>
      <p>
       And yet here you are, an avowed progressive, dismissing facts from DJT Jr's email to defend him and Trump against Russia, all while lying about the meeting and contents of the email.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why do you lie to defend Trump from Russia? It really does not fit with how you repeatedly describe yourself when people point out how often you attack the Russian conspiracy as nonsense using disingenuous tactics.

       Huh? I'm just asking you to back up your claims. I literally haven't even made an argument. lol what's the matter with you?
      </p>
      <p>
       If you're going to say that Russia meddled in the election then you have to be able to demonstrate that the Russian government actually interfered. Other ppl in the thread seemed to be suggesting that Russia interfered by purchasing Facebook ads but you're saying that the Russian government enlisted the help of a private citizen to interfere in the United States election and that the citizen did so by emailing Don Jr. Did I get that right? You can't make ridiculous claims like that without providing evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       And it's no surprise that, when unable to do so, you've resorted to personal attacks.

       My claims are literally just facts from DJT Jr's email that he released himself. Even though nobody at the meeting is disputing these facts, here you are lying about them.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, do I get that right? When I state a fact from DJT Jr's email that hasn't been disputed, you dismiss it as a ridiculous claim. Your bias is so blatantly obvious that it clashes with how you describe yourself.
      </p>
      <p>
       I didn't resort to a personal attack, I clearly spelled everything out for you. I only point out the obvious discrepancy between your claim to be a progressive and how often you lie to defend Trump and Russia because I see you around here often, and every time you are going out of your way to dismiss the Russian conspiracy, occasionally resorting to outright lies (as you are doing here).

       No no friend. How far down do I have to break this down. I never made a guess. Nowhere was there any guessing. I provided a clear answer ONLY to "private companies".

       Your answer was one word. Sanctions. Then you said you have no idea if they breached those sanctions, implying there are sanctions. Those sanctions don't exist. You can argue all you want, but you tossed out an answer with no knowledge about it. People would call that a guess, or worse, an assumption.

       Private companies still have to comply with trade restrictions that their country implements.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is why people/companies have gotten in trouble in the (somewhat recent) past for doing business with Iran (when it was under trade sanctions), as an example.

       Sanctions are morally wrong. You shouldn't Base your judgment of a company's actions as right or wrong based on the arbitrary punitive legal decisions of a nation state. In a just world we'd have sanctions on America for tampering with everyone else's elections, spying, illegal invasions, immoral and fatal embargoes and sanctions, destroying economies, psyops, the list goes on, but we don't but that doesn't make doing business with them while they occupy foreign nations just. Use your moral compass to judge not a legal framework bought and paid for.

       I agree that sanctions are morally wrong. They are economic weapons that should not be used to coerce other nations, and really should be used only in a time of war.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also agree that in a just world, likely "everyone else" would be banding together to sanction the USA, as you describe.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, my original comment really didn't contain any commentary on the morality of sanctions.
      </p>
      <p>
       I merely specifically spelled out that companies
       <em>
        ARE FREE
       </em>
       to do what they please, but that there will be domestic penalties involved with violating an international trade sanction (penalties to the point that will often make it unprofitable for the company to continue violating the trade sanction).

       I guess I'm just saying I don't agree with that. Companies should be free to do with they please so long as it's not unethical. Trading with people in a country that doesn't have their best interests at heart isn't ethical, but is as you said an economic weapon.

       I agree.
      </p>
      <p>
       But it doesn't change the fact that the companies also have to comply with the laws of their home country.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nor does it change the fact that their home country has penalties for violating its domestic laws.
      </p>
      <p>
       Companies who routinely violate laws get shut down (or at least they
       <em>
        SHOULD
       </em>
       , and its sad to me that they often
       <em>
        DON'T
       </em>
       , but that's another discussion for another time), and getting shut down by the government is undeniably an unfavorable business outcome for the owners of said company. It's bad for business, so to speak.
      </p>
      <p>
       I agree overall though - the onus of unethicality is on the government who imposed the trade sanctions in the first place.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think that the difference between us (at least what I percieve to be the difference) is that I also strongly distrust companies in addition to government. Both are organizations that are often (and easily) abused, to the detriment of the common man.
      </p>
      <p>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       You said in your initial post that the laws are "bought and paid for" / corrupt, but neglected to mention that a "Corporation" is a fictitious legal entity created specifically to exempt the "owners" from true personal responsibility for the actions of their business. Surely that has some moral implications of its own, no?
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean, really, do you think Monsanto would be buying our government off, in order to get the ability to mass-poison the country's food supply with glyphosate, in order to make significantly higher profits, if the board of directors and the executive suite could be held personally legally responsible for the actions of the company?
      </p>
      <p>
       You know, like if the whole board of directors could go to federal-pound-me-in-the-ass prison for assault (and potentially attempted murder / actual murder) because they wanted to make higher profits for Monsanto Inc? Do you really think they would still be doing what they are doing?
      </p>
      <p>
       I highly doubt it.

It's incredible to me that the US dares to even suggest it has the right to meddle in Germany's economic affairs -- the Germans are quite capable of making their own judgements about the extent to which they want to deal with Russia.

       I want to know why we only hear about Russia. Certainly they aren't the only country interested in swaying US politics. They are probably 1 or 50 nations doing this, but the media acts like on Russia matters. Hackers too: only Russia has them apparently.

       Surely it wasn't Russia's actions in Eastern Europe as well as recommendations and reports from our Intelligence agencies which point to Russia being aggressive in their propaganda. No, surely not, they've been complete peaches, this whole stuff is just a Boogeyman.

       I hadn't heard Russia
       <em>
        SERIOUSLY
       </em>
       being described in a boogeyman fashion since the USSR broke up in the 90's. Obviously references in pop-culture / movies / etc.. do not count (of which there have been many).
      </p>
      <p>
       Then, 20-30 years later all of a sudden "Russia" is super aggressive and powerful again? They are all of a sudden so good at hacking that they are able to bypass / fool
       <em>
        ALL

       of the allied intelligence services (NSA/CIA/DIA/FBI/NGA and their counterparts in the UK, Canada, Australia, New Zealand), with zero detection at all (until after the fact) like they don't even exist? Meh. I don't buy it.

       So were you paying any attention at all to Eastern Europe? Ukraine? They've been very aggressive militarily lately which is why the media has been focusing on them.
      </p>
      <p>
       When the USSR collapsed, they still had all their spies and ez-KGB people around, did they not? The USSRs spy program was the best or very close to best in the world, idk if there was any doubt about that. So it's not unreasonable to think that these organizations and infrastructure could survive past the fall of the USSR.
      </p>
      <p>
       Recently when you hear about Russian aggression, it has to do with propaganda and disinformation, which is right up the ex-KGB's ally. I think people have watched Eastern Europe become incapacitated by Russian disinformation, then afterwards invaded militarily. How you call that a "Boogeyman" is confusing.

       They fit entirely. Going around pointing fingers when your country is doing the same if not worse is disengenuous. We should be clear on that almost every nuclear nation and nation with large intelligence programs is a threat to humanity and operating against the interest of everyone on this planet. And yet Americans will gladly point fingers at Russia because it suits them. It does nothing to help anyone.

       It is a challenge to find proof and evidence of these types of things, which is a double edged sword, of course. Tbh I don't think anyone who knows anything about what went on in the spy/diplomacy world in Ukraine would tell anything on Reddit.

       It is an undeniable fact.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, if the territory was seized by Russia to prevent it's sea trade routes and naval bases from being disrupted due to the fact that a Russian-friendly government was being supplanted by a Russian-unfriendly government (due to US destabilizing the original Russian-friendly government), is it really morally that wrong?
      </p>
      <p>
       In that case I'd say Russia was responding to US action, and was acting in its own best interest - which is hardly unjustified.
      </p>
      <p>
       You seem to be saying that because the evidence is light (because most of it is highly classified information), that it should be discounted - and that we should only rely on 100% provable (with publicly available information) facts.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are many many "coincidences" surrounding the Ukraine situation - and most point directly to the US. Couple that with the US's history of disrupting foreign governments, and it gives credence to these coincidences.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's go the other route and have you assume that the above scenario
       <em>
        IS ACTUALLY THE CASE
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       In that scenario, would you still feel that Russia was the "Aggressor" and that the US is still the "chosen one who can do no wrong"?

       Tbh it's hard to say what i'd say if I believed that was the case, because if I did it would be built on news/evidence of aggressive action. I'm not naive, the US is actively working towards ways to diplomatically sway nations into their favor - and so I give Russia that same benefit. What news/articles/evidence do you have that the US made aggressive actions to oust a Russian-friendly government and install a US-friendly one? The question would be if those diplomatic actions prompt a military response.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's ignorant to neglect the interests of Ukrainian politicians and people, so there's an entire facet of this situation which is being neglected. Do you hear how this sounds? Straight out of the cold war with 2 sides being diametrically opposed, completely neglecting the middle man - which I don't think should be the case in today's world. It sucks to say.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even in the scenario that the US was aggressive in diplomatically changing Ukraine's stance towards NATO and the US, that doesn't excuse annexing land through military force - that is objectively an escalation in aggression.

       De-stabilizing a "less friendly" foreign government in order to supplant it with a "more friendly" government is not "diplomatic action". I'm sorry. That is just ridiculous. It is undeniably an act of war against the "less friendly" government.

       The US didn't go in there and lobby the existing politicians to do something that was desired by the US. They went in and
       <em>
        REMOVED
       </em>
       the existing politicians.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your bias is showing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also you didn't even attempt to speculate that my hypothetical was true. You just went back to asking for "evidence" from our bought-and-paid-for "news media". Game over, you chose not to play.

       First of all, obviously my bias is showing because I don't read Russian news. I haven't seen any news or articles or anything about this so-called violent removal of existing politicians, that's why I asked for you to show me them. Maybe you could explain further?
      </p>
      <p>
       I did entertain the thought at the end, which I said it is objectively true that annexing land through military force is an escalation. Was there no diplomatic solution? Obviously I don't know much about the other side of the story, please tell.

       Barack Obama before UK's Brexit vote:
      </p>
      <p>
       "I think it’s fair to say that maybe some point down the line there might be a UK-US trade agreement, but it’s not going to happen any time soon because our focus is in negotiating with a big bloc, the European Union, to get a trade agreement done”.
      </p>
      <p>
       He added: “
       <strong>
        The UK is going to be in the back of the queue.
       </strong>
       ”
      </p>
      <p>
       Standing alongside his visitor, Cameron said the referendum was the “sovereign choice of the British people”.

       It was said right before people were being asked to vote on Brexit. The implication being vote for Brexit and you'll be fucked economically. Hence the British PM said the vote was a “sovereign choice of the British people".

Why wouldnt the US do the same and shouldnt the people understand the basic facts about what they are getting themselves into before voting on it? I really dont see anything controversial in that statement.

       Yes of course the US has interfered in many elections and the people of those countries have every right to be upset and question the legitimacy of those elections. Just like I question the legitimacy of an election in which Russia was clearly running a disinformation campaign to mislead voters.

       So what if another country did it? It's no better or worse than every US election that has billions of dollars pumped into it through donors, lobbyists, special interest groups, unions, big business, etc. I'm amazed that people that think another country putting money into our election is any more wrong than our representatives being bought in each election.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would argue that foreign states have a larger interest in our elections than any small time donor or lobbyist so if the opportunity arises they should do it.
