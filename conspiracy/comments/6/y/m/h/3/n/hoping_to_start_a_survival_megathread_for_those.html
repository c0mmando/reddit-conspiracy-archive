I&#39;m out of the affected area, and can&#39;t offer much in the way of physical assistance, but I would like to do what I can to help. In this case, it&#39;s offering PDF dumps. </p>

<p><a href="https://archive.org/details/military-manuals">https://archive.org/details/military-manuals</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/policy/army/fm/">http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/policy/army/fm/</a></p>

<p>The above links contain fairly comprehensive lists of links to field manuals. Not all are relevant, but within are some very helpful manuals. I used to have half a terabyte of manuals to share, but can&#39;t for the life of me find my external drive. I know they&#39;re out there, so please, anyone and everyone, share what you have saved in your favorites that may be able to assist those in the path of the storm! </p>

<p>I will continue adding to the list in the comments, but wanted to throw this up as soon as possible. I&#39;m truly sorry for not having this idea sooner. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not against the idea, but isn&#39;t the whole system just for this exact thing? That succulents go in <a href="/r/succulents">/r/succulents</a> and <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> has things related to conspiracies? Isn&#39;t that the whole point?</p>

<p>So wouldn&#39;t this be more fit in the plenty outdoor or camping subs? Or maybe even askreddit with a topic &quot;what should people know during Irma&quot;? It is not like they are going to throw you out and you can only hang out here.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t get me wrong, this is a pretty good sub to get the opinion of some doomsday preppers, but I doubt that Irma victims need a bomb shelter, start their own vegetable garden and gather gold. </p>

The hope was that others would contribute what they have saved over the years as well. I just wanted to get the ball rolling. </p>

<p>I know it&#39;s not entirely relevant to the sub, but I know I had favorited a ton of cool and useful links on my laptop before the battery inflated like a balloon and it died, and figured other users here would have done the same.

    <div class="md"><p>If you have just survived a hurricane, I&#39;m pretty sure that surfing through 600 page pdfs about surviving in the jungle for a month and laying traps for rats is not really in your schedule at that moment. </p>

<p>People always save all these documents, but I would want to know how many have actually read and learned from them. And seen if they are possible to pull off. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>And that&#39;s fine, I&#39;m just pointing out that if one would want to do good, he might do more good in relevant subreddits. </p>

<p>Along with that, post some <a href="http://wx.wfla.com/specialprojects/hurricane2017/WFLA_Hurricane%20Guide%202017.pdf">material directly prepared for hurricane victims</a>, not thousands upon thousands of pages of survival in the desert.</p>

<p>I do think you are doing a good thing, but one must always consider the state the victims are in and the exact needs that they have. The line of thinking they&#39;d do. Would a man who is need come to <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, from all places, to look for help? If he does come to reddit, for one reason or another, does he go on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> and if not, then does a sub of this size has a chance to get to <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a> ?</p>

<p>I appreciate the thought, I just think that another thought to base the first one on would be in order. </p>

<p>we make fun of the trailer parkers who always just rebuild and wait for the next one, but why in the hell are they not rebuilding these things to be hurricane/ tornado proof when they get obliterated like this?</p>

<p>remember when people come asking for donations, to only donate to organizations that focus on future prevention and mitigation when it comes to rebuilding funds.
we dont need to piss away billions in building new homes that will just get knocked over in the next one.</p>

<p>but building a wooden house 15 times is probably a lot more expensive than one that can survive hurricanes for 15 years.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know about that, I know that in Mexico 98% made are from concrete and they are not rich. 
Maybe there are laws and regulations that make it more expensive to build a house using stronger materials. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>i think the reasons would be that form of concrete is very cheap (also i though most were made with brick)</p>

<p>you can still build a crappy not strong house with concrete, its all about the regulations regarding building tolerances.</p>

<p>for example parts of canada you have to build a roof strong enough to hold 6 ft worth of snow on top of it, in some areas it much more.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>it&#39;s really amazing how dade and broward really did stiffen our building codes. </p>

<p>if you live here, it seems so incongruous. part of it is that our windstorm insurance is really high and they are very strict. since mortages require insurance to get a loan your house has to meet code. </p>

<p>most of the places were hurricanes happen outside of SOFLA have cheap insurance, because so much of the damage there is high water, so the companies don&#39;t have to pay (flood insurance is only avail through the fed govt, vecause insurers refuse to offer it). without the insurance premiuim pressure, no one is motivated. fo us wind is the biggest problem, so during andrew they had to pay.</p>

<p>we build primarily in concrete block. the homes before 1970 were almost all concrete block. the morning after andrew, a flight over an area that had a mobile home neighborhood, next to a stick-frame neighborhood (this is likely what you live in), next to an older concrete neighborhood, showed that the mobile homes were turned to match sticks, the stick frame homes almost all lost their roofs, windows, and suffered at least 50% of theur walls. the old homes all had their walls and only localized roof damage. that aerial foorage of that is really responsible for our current building codes. builders were sued by thousands.</p>

<p>we also really did become very streamlined and effective with our emergency response. for some reason we learned our lesson from andrew, but no other hurricane prone areas seem to have been.</p>

<p>people don&#39;t understand how hot and humid it is here in SOFLA right now. the heat index is 100. the sun is brutal here and there aren&#39;t a lot of really shady areas and after the storm a lot less. heat stroke is a very real issue, more so than tents etc. cooling people off is going to be critical.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>ps: re the mobile homes--they can&#39;t be tied down securely enough. the wind picks them up and tosses them like toys. it&#39;s very hard for anything affordable to be able to withstand that.</p>

<p>many localities have outlawed mobile homes, but have grandfathered existing ones.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And that&#39;s fine, I&#39;m just pointing out that if one would want to do good, he might do more good in relevant subreddits. </p>

<p>Along with that, post some <a href="http://wx.wfla.com/specialprojects/hurricane2017/WFLA_Hurricane%20Guide%202017.pdf">material directly prepared for hurricane victims</a>, not thousands upon thousands of pages of survival in the desert.</p>

<p>I do think you are doing a good thing, but one must always consider the state the victims are in and the exact needs that they have. The line of thinking they&#39;d do. Would a man who is need come to <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, from all places, to look for help? If he does come to reddit, for one reason or another, does he go on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> and if not, then does a sub of this size has a chance to get to <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a> ?</p>

<p>I appreciate the thought, I just think that another thought to base the first one on would be in order. </p>
