It seems like more than ever we are in a position in which free speech is being trampled on. The constitution isn&#39;t worth the paper that it is printed on.

<p>When you say eliminating, do you mean kill? I believe that would be a very dangerous road to go down. I mean if we set the precedent that it is ok to kill people that we don&#39;t agree with, then what would stop someone from deciding to kill you?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There really isnt much of an issue here to begin with. The MSM is hyping the minimal amount of people who are true white supremacists. George Soros is literally funding the Southern Poverty Law Center (Antifa/BLM), to bring engagement to the other side, to promote division. </p>

<p>George Soros and the CIA did the exact same thing in the Ukraine, funding one side and convincing them that Russia was melding in their democratic election. Those people then rose up against the elected government and over threw them. Now Ukraine has a CIA approved leader. </p>

I have a counter script, everyone versus the world bankers, reclaim the wealth stolen, it will only work if we are unified.  They play a divide and conquer game, it is to our doom.</p>

<p>Americans are for freedom, not nazism, maybe you are actually in germany right now and maybe hitler just stepped off a time machine, but I am guessing you&#39;ve been indoctrinated by a marxist educational system perpetuated by the owners of the federal reserve to try to get you to view your fellow countrymen as enemies rather than to see the man behind the curtain.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the original signers did it to save them and their descendants heads from the King, and possibly to hopefully save the Republic down the road (ie. hoping we&#39;d figure this out - which they did, hence the Civil War). </p>

<p>You have to realize, after the Revolutionary war, the &quot;country&quot; was in billions of dollars of debt. <em>That debt to the old world (Kingdoms of France, Spain, and the Netherlands) had to be paid off</em>, so they created a charter/contract in order to do it. Hence, the Constitution, which made them (and their successors) sovereign. Contracts only apply to original signers and what they agreed upon.</p>

<p>This is why politicians never go to jail. They are above the fraudulent legal system (ie. sovereign via international law). All one has to do, is look and see how the Constitution was really just a contract because already have Natural Law. We do not need a contract for that, and it applies to everyone.</p>

<p>Anyways, for more information on this, here is a great interview discussing this: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08iGjlvJoUQ">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08iGjlvJoUQ</a>. After that, dive into the actual documents via: <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution">https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution</a> or any other law database.

<p>No, just a hypothetical thought experiment. Many people/groups are creating micro-nations around the world, though. It would probably start out as something similar to that. I&#39;d suggest looking into some of those as well, being that they are already established. Anyways, cheers! </p>
