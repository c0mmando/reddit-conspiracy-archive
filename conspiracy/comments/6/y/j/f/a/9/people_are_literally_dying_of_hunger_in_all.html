<p>It&#39;s a valid question.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is based on the premise that people are dieing of hunder every day in all countries. Is this really true? Beginning in the 1980s there was a massive ramp-up of television coverage of &#39;humanitarian crises&#39;. Innocent western people were psychologically traumatised into feeling guilty for merely living their lives.</p>

<p>Do you ever wonder why the average person today seems to think and act like a complete zombie? If so, have you ever wondered if perhaps things were not always this way? It turns out the average western person today has been effectively lobotomised. I put to you that the images we see of starving children on TV has played a part in this.</p>

All federal income tax <a href="http://i.imgur.com/eoChcXj.png">http://i.imgur.com/eoChcXj.png</a> goes to the owners of the federal reserve making them the unseen oligarchy of the USA and all US citizens slaves.  The top 10% have 76% of wealth in the USA.  This idea is only growing worse, and exists in virtually every nation except for (shocker) north korea (USA military lapdog being used to attack NK) and Iran.  </p>

<p>To say these global bankers don&#39;t care is an understatement, they see profit in war and death, they seek to create it.  In the USA directly they seek to get citizens to act on the old 1910-1940s europe script commies versus nazis.  I have a counter script, everyone versus the bankers.</p>

If the entire world could prevent food waste and distribute this food efficiently there probably wouldn&#39;t be any hunger. I&#39;m fascinated by freeze drying technology since with proper food storage technology food can be edible for decades.</p>

<p>I&#39;m trying to get a book entitled The Water Harvester, but I haven&#39;t been successful.  It&#39;s about a man in Africa who was dirt poor with five children who just had some arid land and through observation and hard work he turned it into a thriving farm and gives away much of his produce.</p>

I remember an employee at the local Pizza Hut once saying they had a corporate policy(don&#39;t know if they still do) that any left over food had to be put in the dumpsters with bleach poured on it. Seems like some policy adjustments would have more than enough influence without cutting money dedicated to research.</p>

<p>I thought Trump would be different but he&#39;s not.  He&#39;s giving these death merchants more money (eg the federal budget).  He&#39;s cutting everything else.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>We can easily feed the hungry of the world if we take even 20-30% of the DoD budget and put it towards creating sustainable agriculture in these places (including our own countries) to feed the homeless. It&#39;d be pretty easy, just needs funding. The problem with it is, if we try to place one of these systems in some African countries with a lot of bandits or armed groups then those sites will become a target as well. Flying in a steady stream is more costly (but not impossible) but would also face the same issues. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is a /pol/ opinion, but it&#39;s up to those countries to evolve and figure out the crisis for themselves.  When you save a 3rd world country from hunger, disease, etc., their population explodes and creates a flow of migrants into the surrounding countries. </p>

<p>This is looking at it resource wise and not looking at it on an individual human level.  If we save every person in poverty their current infrastructure couldn&#39;t support it, more and more would come across the boarder.  To accommodate that many people would dilute the available resources for the people currently there. </p>

<p>It might sound rude, but building infrastructure and businesses in impoverished countries is more important than saving the population. </p>
