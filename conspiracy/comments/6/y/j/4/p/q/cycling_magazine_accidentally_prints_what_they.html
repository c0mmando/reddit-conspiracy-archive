       </strong>
       <strong>
        - for dummies
       </strong>
       <br/>
       "Cycling Weekly", same as all other cycling or athletics magazines and international federations, is controlled by the very same illuminati destroying natural sports.
       <br/>
       That's the main agenda behind champions falsely accused of doping, blackmailed to "confess" or spend 20 years in jail.
       <br/>
       Talk of demonizing cyclists and joggers, but this time not served as "glitch" but rather another similar technique, a reminder, weeks earlier, introduced by ...
      </p>
      <p>
       Jul/Aug 2017:
       <br/>
       ALL Headlines are in fact psy-ops. After reading this you'll know what a "news" article is about whenever its headlines include the words "cyclist" (not sports related) or "jogger".
       <br/>
       "
       <em>
        Video Shows Cyclist Rammed SUV Driver in Hit-and-Run
       </em>
       ": same agenda as "
       <em>
        Jogger caught on video knocking woman into road
       </em>
       ", unlike what the first headlines suggest.
      </p>

       <em>
        Video Shows Cyclist Rammed SUV Driver in Hit-and-Run
       </em>
       <br/>
       This psy-op (all actors) uses the "Black is white" technique, the goal is the opposite of what the first headlines suggest: not to protect but to demonize cyclists, to keep them out of the streets.
      </p>

       <br/>
       Demonize psy-op targeting joggers, timed for the World Athletics Championships.
       <br/>
       Extreme mockery of human cattle swallowing this as news: jogger arrested two days later although it's impossible to recognize a face in the video.

        CONTEXT
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Example of a psy-op where demonizing joggers was one of the agendas: the "pilot" cast as "mentally ill and fanatic jogger":
       <br/>
       Fake Germanwings Crash ALL staged with actors, the dirty version of 9/11 Shanksville
       <br/>
       Fake Germanwings crash first impact: satanic celebration of burnt human cattle carcasses at landfill.
       <br/>
       Unlike the previous episode, "Dropped all dead", days earlier in Argentina,  this time the "passengers" don't symbolize what's being buried.
       <br/>
       The opera singers, ranging from a contralto to a bass-baritone, are on stage to indeed sing a satanic aria while human carcasses are reduced to ashes.

       Last Prophet's words from 2004:
       <br/>
       Making it difficult for bicycles and running shoes to be used for what they were meant for.
       <br/>
       Before Global Genocide and the proclamation of Global Slavery, the illuminati:
       <br/>
       - build barriers, not only physical but also psychological, for people to start jogging and cycling;
       <br/>
       - dumb down people with non-stop illuminati sports on TV.
      </p>
      <p>
       Tennis around the clock on illuminati TV is part of the same ZOMBIFY agenda as motor "sports" like Formula 1: reduce humans to robotical beasts.
       <br/>
       Mocked with "state of coma" jokes: from Michael Schumacher (original article, Dec 2013) to Roger Federer's fan (added Sep 2015).

       <strong>
        BASICS
       </strong>
       <br/>
       From June 2012:
       <br/>
       In 2007 Last Prophet explained that Usain Bolt would be executed the same way as Lance Armstrong.
       <br/>
       In 2008 after Usain Bolt set his world records at the Beijing Olympics, Last Prophet explained that Usain Bolt became the fastest man ever AND FOREVER.
       <br/>
       Last Prophet explained immediately after the illuminati were forced to use plan B for the 2008 "election" and have "Obama" play counterfeit president and have him detonate as fake suicide bomber (like Nixon) later, that illuminati actor "Obama" would be executed the same way as the two greatest sports champions ever, Armstrong and Bolt:
       <br/>
       - accused of all sort of crimes (forging birth certificate; murdering "granny", etc);
       <br/>
       - stripped of his title, with Hillary Clinton declared 44th president and successor of GW Bush.
       <br/>
       All this part also of the supervised ethnic civil war script, to be launched together with the collapse of banks and annihilation of savings and pension funds of the human cattle.
       <br/>
       In Forums:
       <br/>
       Lance Armstrong. Usain Bolt, "Hussein Obama II" accused and stripped - first of six acts June 29 2012

      <p>
       The illuminati doping conspiracy - From 2009, timestamp verifiable in webarchive:
       <br/>
       Lance Armstrong not Usain Bolt will be summarily executed first. His accident triggered the decision about at which door did the Neo-Gestapo knock out first.

       Jan 2017: Usain Bolt finally stripped of his first medal, 7 years after the first scripted date
       <br/>
       ONE world title out of TWENTY (11 at World Championships and 9 at Olympic Games) is all it takes to officially strip from Bolt what some falsely consider his ultimate milestone, the triple triple at the Olympics.
       <br/>
       First headlines, which in a psy-op (in this case setting the stage to accuse Bolt of doping) play a key role:
       <br/>
       - either suggest that it's already the script's climax, the execution of Usain Bolt, omitting that at this point it's still about Nesta Carter from Jamaica's relay: "SportsFlash Videos - Usain Bolt stripped of Olympic Gold";
       <br/>
       - or simply omit that it starts with Beijing (word not mentioned in headlines) 2008 (word also omitted in article): "Usain Bolt loses gold medal after relay teammate found guilty of doping".

       From "public" simulated only with actors to manhunt for "perfectly integrated aliens".
       <br/>
       One of the agendas of this psy-op is to have the audience accept execution of anyone for any "crime":

       Talk of reasoning ...

       The main reason you fail to get ANYTHING not served to you by the illuminati media resumes to basic fact #5 about human cattle - your near total loss of the capacity for logical reasoning.

       Poster Perdidas is not criticizing the article, which would require arguing what OP exposes with direct examples and evidence.
       <br/>
       It's called spam and it's not welcome in my threads.

       Time for you to get where the Web of TRUTH emerges in God's timeline:
       <br/>
       As you would expect from the Laws of End Times Reductionism, the process representing how the masses are confronted with the HORRIBLE TRUTH about their last days in Illuminatziland, involves only five entities and resumes to only three steps.

       This article's title comes directly from the Yahoo "news" story, see link in Notes section.

       "for dummies" is appended to that title, as the article exposes the agenda behind it.
