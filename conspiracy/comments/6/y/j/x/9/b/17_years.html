        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>17 years. This year is my 17th year in school. </p>

<p>17 years I&#39;ve been slaving away with the weight of grades and &quot;progress&quot; on my back. For what? The assumption that I&#39;ll be something when I leave? That I&#39;ll have climbed through the proverbial ranks and that I&#39;ve paved a pathway to success with diplomas and expensive single use gowns and caps? Leaving what behind me? A trail of forgotten homework assignments, president&#39;s quizzes, neanderthals meandering in their bipedal glory?</p>

<p>17 years I&#39;ve been a slave to the educational machine. For 17 years I&#39;ve been forced to read, memorize, regurgitate, day in and day out, with nary a break for longer than a few days, 2 months at the most. Sitting, listening, watching, tense and afraid of reprimandation, the consequences of acting out, that&#39;s &quot;learning&quot;. All to one day be done with one step, to move onto the next without the faintest feeling of confidence on whether or not I made the right choice. Do I really want to go to that college for that major? Will paying over $25,000 per year really get me ahead?</p>

<p>For 17 years, I&#39;ve been brainwashed into believing that this world is concrete. That when I leave the comfort and carefree atmosphere of education, I&#39;ll be in a world that goes on and on. I&#39;ll be a part of the machine that never sleeps, only to put in my time, my 1/3 of a day doing something that I may or may not truly enjoy. Something that may or may not actually empower me. Something that may or may not depress me, and drive me to vices to get my mind off the sick reality of the situation.  8 hours a day, on the clock, not counting the commute time, or preparation before and the wind down after to compensate for the stress that is endured. Not unlike the 8 hours a day that I&#39;ve spent for 17 years in school, now instead of &quot;learning&quot; i&#39;m &quot;working&quot; to hopefully stuff my bank account with enough money to pay for all my bills.</p>

<p>People working, stressing, worrying about their jobs and careers, every day with only a few days off. From sun up to sun down, putting in time at the office, in the field, in the shop, wherever you are. Trying to get that reward at the end of the week. A few tokens to trade for the neccessities to keep me alive; food, water, shelter, a small price to pay for living in a &quot;first world country&quot;. Maybe if I&#39;m lucky I&#39;ll have some tokens and certificates left over so I can inebriate myself to the point of babbling nonsense just to drown out the feelings of worthlessness and insignificance. </p>

<p>17 years have gone by, and I&#39;m still caught in the whirlwind. I&#39;m not done yet, but you best believe I spend a small portion of every day contemplating what it&#39;s all worth? Have I learned an appropriate amount of information compared to the amount of time I&#39;ve spent being &quot;taught&quot;? Maybe. Who&#39;s to say? How can an individual truly be assesed on his mental capacity? The spell we&#39;re under that makes us believe that we&#39;re doing the right thing, that continuing education is what makes you a step ahead. Always stay ahead of the Jones&#39;s, they might have a beemer, but if you work hard enough and put in the time, you&#39;ll have a porche. </p>

<p>For 17 years I&#39;ve been under the guise that I&#39;m doing something to better myself. Paying for my further education is the best thing I can do, after all, money spent on knowledge is money well spent, right? That&#39;s what they say, but is it true? Time will tell. </p>

<p>In 17 years, where will I be? Like the writing prompts of junior year, I don&#39;t know where I see myself. Because 17 years ago I guarantee the answer wasn&#39;t halfway between work and school. What will the world be like then? What will the kids who are starting school now be like? Will there be anyone else like me? Is there anyone else like me now? Someone who wonders if it&#39;s all worthwhile? What&#39;s the point anyways? Who is it all for? I don&#39;t profit from the time I spend at work. I hardly make enough tokens to trade for a loaf of bread and gasoline at the end of the week.</p>

<p>12 years of primary school and 7 years of advanced degrees. That&#39;s 19 years. 19 years of school you lazy shit. </p>

<p>What do I have to show for it?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Makes sense, ever since I started smoking, the world has revealed this unending meaninglessness. Then tripping and whatnot destroyed the point of existence for me entirely, nihilism was my thing for a wile. Eventually I learned that everything is pointless unless you say so basically, you create your own reality, therefore what you believe about something is exactly what you see it to be. You see something as pointless, therefore, it is. Simple. Do what you want with your life, find a point, or make one.</p>

<p>The past is over, 17 years is a long time but you&#39;re not ever going to get it back. That should be your incentive to fix whatever it is, or find your &quot;point&quot;, as soon as possible. </p>

<p>You feel like a prisoner, and a lot of us do, it makes us stronger. We fight and struggle and get depressed and fight suicidal thoughts and our environment and the people in it, all to have a place to sleep at night. It&#39;s fucking brutal, even for no good reason sometimes.</p>

<p>Be the change you want to see in the world, help other people do the same, find something you love and do it.</p>

<p>My bad for the long post but I know how you feel, lady and or dude. Coping with life isn&#39;t easy, even if it might seem easy from someone else&#39;s perspective, best of luck to you and everyone else who has to deal with these things </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks, my realizations and (mis?)understandings of reality were born of my entheogenic experiences as well. It seems unfortunate that we&#39;re pit against each other with the media and our culture persuading us to act a certain way. You&#39;ve mentioned a lot of my favorite adages and reminded me that life is what I make it. I realize that I&#39;ve been moping about lately making life purposeless and struggling to find the meaning of something that just is. The depressing thoughts and feelings will always be there, but may not be reflective of the reality that truly exists. Its very easy to get swept away in the current of endless chatter in the mind, only to forget why I&#39;ve began feeling depressed again at the end of a long sad chain of thoughts. Thank you for pulling my head above the water and showing me where the riverbank is. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just love everybody and everything all the time, even if you don&#39;t, you have the potential to. Like, &quot;damn lady you&#39;re in my fucking way right now and you gotta fucking move, but damn do I sure love that you exist to give me this experience that I hate so fucking much making me appreciate it when people are aware of their surroundings and polite&quot;. Or &quot;wow I fucking hate the rain and getting all wet, but holy fuck I love drinking water and breathing air from the plants you help grow&quot; </p>

<p>Highs and lows exist for everything, happy and sad, good and bad. The key is a perfect balance, which it sounds like you know but you were starting to go off a bit. Learning to surf the waves instead of smashing off of the sharp rocks at the bottom is good for the soul.</p>

<p>You&#39;re welcome, but no thanks is necessary, I want to see us weirdo little earthlings do something great with the future. And it all starts from within each of us who hear the calling, to dig deep into our souls and find a balance for the world, so nobody else has to deal with the same problems we have now. They can focus on themselves and their own problems, instead of dealing with problems created before they were even born like we have had to, we need to make it a point to change the world for the better. </p>

<p>Well I went off again, but it was nice having words with you kind stranger, peace and good fortune to ye! Aha </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not as bleak, nor as cut and dried as it presently appears. That&#39;s simply because you&#39;re young and understanding only comes and grows with time and experience.</p>

<p>Human beings are social creatures and being among and interacting with other human beings is actually more important to most of them than whatever they get paid to do that gives them some kind of an opportunity to do that. </p>

<p>Some opportunities are far better than others in that regard although they may actually pay less than ones where you definitely are far more isolated and alone when it comes to the tasks you&#39;re required to do. Over time you begin to get a handle on what you&#39;re most comfortable doing and can take in stride remembering that you work &quot;to live&quot;, not live &quot;to work&quot;.</p>

<p>The more positive and upbeat those social interactions are the better and more likeable the job itself is. It also helps if the job itself or whatever industry it belongs to or service it provides is interesting enough to learn and know as much about as you can in order to do the best you that can in whatever role you accept to play in it.</p>

<p>You never stop learning and all the learning that you do after your school days is actually where the rubber meets the road. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have experienced this realization when I turned 18. I am now 28. </p>

<p>You must be strong. Hone your willpower and use your heart to guide it. </p>

<p>Know yourself! If you know yourself nobody can tell you what to do, what to think or how to act. Know your weaknesses and improve upon them everyday. </p>

<p>Master your thought process. Eliminate thoughts patterns that negate your improvement. Often sit down and observe your thoughts and notice how many of them are frivolous and negative to your health. Little by little replace them with positive joyful optimistic thoughts. </p>

<p>You are powerful, don&#39;t ever forget that. </p>

<p>Mend the broken, 
Make strong the weak,
And forever vanquish evil. </p>

<p>Take care brother, you are not alone </p>

<p>I use like 0.5 % of what I&#39;ve read through in my day-to-day life and job (that requires MSCE degree). It&#39;s a fucking waste of time and resources.</p>

<p>I mine raw materials (ores), but make sure I plant more trees than I had to destroy. I make sure the water in the creek is at least as clean as I found it. I make sure socio-economic status of the immediate region I&#39;m in is better when I leave.</p>

<p>I use solar power as much as possible, or grid power served by renewable sources.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not trying to save the planet, I&#39;m not trying to enrich myself obscenely, I&#39;m not trying to rip the world apart for personal gain.
