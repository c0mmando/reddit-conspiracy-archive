    <div class="md"><p>I only listed the debris because I&#39;ve heard that as one excuse. </p>

<p>I believe 9/11 was a planned and orchestra event by our government to unify the nation and cause false patriotism to demand revenge and support the war. </p>

<p>I do not believe it was orchestrated by the Jews, or shadow reptilians or personX from a blurry photo montage video from YouTube that this person just happened to find and needed to get the truth out about! (Don&#39;t forget to like and subscribe while you watch it!)</p>

<p>So yes, orchestrated. 
But not to the degree of conspiracy that people have taken it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay, I checked that out. The plane speed vs air density was interesting and at bare minimum I&#39;ll look into more. </p>

<p>However, to say 3,000 people didn&#39;t die? The deaths were all faked?  How would that happen? Would they completely close off the WTC that day to the every day normal people who work there? It seems like at this point in time we&#39;d have heard at least one person come forward to say &quot;the whole area was blocked off and I couldn&#39;t go to work.&quot;  That part seems a bit stretched to me. </p>

<p>My belief is that people died, but it was a planned event.  </p>

<p>However, I don&#39;t think you answered the question I posed?</p>

<p>I recommend you do. Once you come to realise that the footage we saw that day (and so many times since) was physically impossible (laughably so), everything will change for you, and 95% of &#39;conspiracy&#39; will seem trivial if not infantile to you.</p>

<p>Media fakery is real, it is demonstrable, and an understanding of it allows one to escape the matrix. </p>

Person B who is talking about the theory of dummy companies setting up people with fake names and etc to pull this psyop and those people worked there for just one year or two years before 9/11. Wouldn&#39;t that all be verifiable in some way?  Genuinely curious, not asking to be a dick</p>

<p>No one needs any experts to tell them that or to confirm it. It very plainly and obviously <em>was what it was</em> and there is no other, better, more logical, or sound an explanation for it than just that because that was precisely and unequivocally what it was. </p>

<p>The official story was nothing but a fairy tale for little children and adults who are in denial about the fact that their government hasn&#39;t got the slightest regard for their health, lives, or safety beyond the kind of exorbitant commercial profits that can be made by using that as an excuse to funnel their tax dollars straight into the eagerly waiting hands that were deliberately set up to do just that and laugh all the way to the bank with them.</p>
