       If the report comes back after two years of research and says it was as a result of the debris hitting the building, or some other related occurance, not a man made bomb planted demolition, will you accept their findings?
      </p>
      <p>
       Or, will you call them shills, fakes, corrupt etc?
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe 9/11 was to some degree orchestrated, I'll just get that out of the way. I am just curious to see what others will do once the report comes out?

       Woah man, simmer down there. 
I literally just said it was orchestrated by he government in my opinion.

      <p>
       I was wondering if people here would accept the findings as truth? Or, only agree if it follows their narrative.

       I never once said you were all nuts. Calm down.

       I only listed the debris because I've heard that as one excuse.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe 9/11 was a planned and orchestra event by our government to unify the nation and cause false patriotism to demand revenge and support the war.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do not believe it was orchestrated by the Jews, or shadow reptilians or personX from a blurry photo montage video from YouTube that this person just happened to find and needed to get the truth out about! (Don't forget to like and subscribe while you watch it!)
      </p>
      <p>
       So yes, orchestrated. 
But not to the degree of conspiracy that people have taken it.

       I work with a guy that calls in sick (has a cold) the day after he has to work in the rain (he's an old man and a HUGE vindictive dickhead) . His claim is about the equivalent of the building collapsing due to debris, my response is always "how can that dude even take a shower?"

       Okay, I checked that out. The plane speed vs air density was interesting and at bare minimum I'll look into more.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, to say 3,000 people didn't die? The deaths were all faked?  How would that happen? Would they completely close off the WTC that day to the every day normal people who work there? It seems like at this point in time we'd have heard at least one person come forward to say "the whole area was blocked off and I couldn't go to work."  That part seems a bit stretched to me.
      </p>
      <p>
       My belief is that people died, but it was a planned event.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, I don't think you answered the question I posed?

       I recommend you do. Once you come to realise that the footage we saw that day (and so many times since) was physically impossible (laughably so), everything will change for you, and 95% of 'conspiracy' will seem trivial if not infantile to you.

       Media fakery is real, it is demonstrable, and an understanding of it allows one to escape the matrix.

       Confused though, and granted I only watched until about 7 mins because I'm about to head out the door.
       <br/>
       Person B who is talking about the theory of dummy companies setting up people with fake names and etc to pull this psyop and those people worked there for just one year or two years before 9/11. Wouldn't that all be verifiable in some way?  Genuinely curious, not asking to be a dick

       Gee, couldn't see that coming. 'I know someone who died, but I can't tell you who'. Are we talking about 9/11, or Boston, or Sandy Hook, or Nice? Same story every time.

       That will be totally dependent on the model they present to support their assertion.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the model is open for all to see and everything adds up, then we have no choice but to accept it for it would be the truth.

      <p>
       And that's exactly why NIST

       Right I understand that, and I genuinely hope most people go into this with that mindset. 
I personally hope their research proves it with such volume that something is finally done about it. 
Although I doubt anything would be done about it, and because it's not mainstream, the general population won't care enough to take action.

       I have a few friends tuning in who are waking up to 9/11 these last few years. This is the kinda thing that could sway their opinions and the opinions of those that demand the scientific method.

       Is it public? Can we check it ourselves? If so, and if we can and if that's what it proves, then yes.

       All the buildings were felled by high explosives in a controlled demolition with the two main towers quite literally blown to smithereens to minimize the ground level damage and clean-up with building 7 being dropped more conventionally due to it's much smaller size and location.

       No one needs any experts to tell them that or to confirm it. It very plainly and obviously
       <em>
        was what it was
       </em>
       and there is no other, better, more logical, or sound an explanation for it than just that because that was precisely and unequivocally what it was.

      <p>
       The official story was nothing but a fairy tale for little children and adults who are in denial about the fact that their government hasn't got the slightest regard for their health, lives, or safety beyond the kind of exorbitant commercial profits that can be made by using that as an excuse to funnel their tax dollars straight into the eagerly waiting hands that were deliberately set up to do just that and laugh all the way to the bank with them.
