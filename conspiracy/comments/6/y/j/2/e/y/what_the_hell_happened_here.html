We got duped by BOTH of them.  They both promised change that didn&#39;t happen.  They both support ever reaching surveillance and war.  We only have the illusion of choice when it comes to presidents or even a lot of things.  There is no right side in this thing.  People who voted differently than you are not the cause of everything shitty the government does.  Why do we keep blaming each other for things we have absolutely no control over while the people who are actually ruining shit go unnoticed?  It&#39;s not a surprise Trump is turning out to be like every other president so why is it so important we act like all this is new or different?  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll be honest because I respect your past comments. Good question that I don&#39;t have an answer for. I think Trump does a lot of shit just to see how people react. But I&#39;m not necessarily saying that&#39;s the thing here cause I don&#39;t know. I think that&#39;s why he did the Syria bomb thing and the Afghanistan bomb. To see how someone reacts to see if their actions are the same as their words. </p>

<p>Imo theres a lot of shit can&#39;t come right out and say because the general public is so brainwashed so bad they would turn on him. For example im damn confident he&#39;s going against Israel right now, but he has to skirt all around because the general public would call him antisemite and probably call for his head. </p>

<p>It keeps people voting at all. </p>

<p>From the user level it&#39;s far easier to bitch or praise a leader than to  make real changes where you stand.</p>

<p>From the systemic level, if nobody&#39;s thinking about you then you&#39;ve lost your power.</p>

<p>This combination of perspectives leads those invested in the system to instigate pointless discussions about things we already know or boldfaced lies, the user then is able to perpetuate the discussion instead of engaging in productive behavior.</p>

<p>Very well said. The reality is that most people are incapable of making positive changes to their own lives. They have tried and failed. They have tried and failed to lose wight, or to save money, or even to read books. It is all too hard in an age of instant gratification, a world at our fingertips in every smartphone.</p>

<p>Sadly the conspiracy subculture is overrun by downtrodden people looking for somebody to blame, rather than the person in the mirror. H.L. Mencken <a href="https://imgur.com/lQOSTGg">was right</a>. How many people really want to think for themselves, though?</p>

<p>I have searched far and wide and it is difficult to find honest, open, non-partisan discussion about what this existence is, what is happening, and why. There are forums like GLP which are full of legitimately insane people (or people pretending to be). Too much doomporn, same as zerohedge. Most places which discuss conspiracy are still oblivious to the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-bmS1aResY">most important elements of 9/11</a> (some even ban discussion of it). </p>

<p>I often post links to <a href="http://fakeologist.com/">fakeologist.com</a> where they are at least completely awake to media fakery. They don&#39;t much discuss the JQ there but if that is your thing there are plenty of outlets for that. Sadly, those outlets are oblivious to media fakery.

<p>There are a couple of interesting threads to tug on and users to interact with over at <a href="/r/sorceryofthespectacle">/r/sorceryofthespectacle</a> and <a href="/r/ancientfutures">/r/ancientfutures</a> </p>

<p>What tends to interest me the most these days is the previously unseen ground of language being used to manufacture &quot;meaning&quot; to great effect. The map being the territory because we all have the map, everybody knows the mappitory!</p>

<p>There are people who&#39;ve traveled to the undefined edges, realized that anything is possible there and never wrote &quot;There be dragons here.&quot; Although, the dragons on the map can be as real as one requires. It can remap the whole territory for you, or you just might prefer to remain in the territory instead of the demanding photorealistic map.</p>
