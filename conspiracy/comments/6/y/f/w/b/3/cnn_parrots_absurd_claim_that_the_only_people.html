<p>This entire article is beyond absurd. <a href="http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/economy-budget/339549-for-gun-law-reciprocity-bill-foes-desperate-times-call-for">Here</a> is Rep. Richard Hudson&#39;s (the representative who introduced the bill) response to this claim (originally made by the DA of NYC), where he eloquently explains exactly why claims like these are nonsense... but CNN won&#39;t let logic and reason stand in the way of their narrative!</p>

<p>For the people who constantly say &quot;NO ONE&#39;s trying to take your guns!&quot; I ask... What good is having a gun and a legal permit to carry it if I&#39;m not allowed to bring it with me anywhere? I work in NY, PA and NJ, so I&#39;m not able to carry my firearm with me every day because if I get pulled over while I&#39;m in NJ, I can be thrown in jail (despite being an otherwise law-abiding citizen). Seems to me like it would be much easier for TPTB to first just restrict WHERE you can have a gun, rather than WHO can have a gun.</p>

<p>To suggest that the only people who would support this bill are ISIS is the most outrageous and blatant scare tactic that I&#39;ve ever seen from the anti-gun advocates, not to mention an outright lie.</p>

<p>Really makes you start to question the whole &quot;NO ONE&#39;S COMING FOR YOUR GUNS!!!&quot; argument... </p>

<p>And since this is r/conspiracy, I&#39;d just like to point out that the video from the CNN article immediately starts off with a Sandy Hook recap (just in case people forgot why guns are bad). </p>

<p>/rant</p>

<p>Edit: If you&#39;re going to downvote this post, could you please at least give an explanation for what you disagree with? A lot of downvotes yet minimal discussion from an opposing point of view.</p>

<p>It was written when rifles could shoot less than a hundred yards accurately and fire less than 10 rounds per minute. Now (as seen in the Aurora, CO shooting) any man, woman, or child can shoot 800 rounds a minute. But as an American, I fuckin love my guns. </p>

<p>I live in the state of CommieFornia (as /gunnit loves to call it). Compared to almost any other state we have the strictest gun restrictions in the country. No short barreled rifles, nothing bigger than 10 rounds a magazine, and the biggest kicker for AR-15 models is a necessary tool to take out the magazine. </p>

<p>Those laws won&#39;t stop a shooter tho, just make it more difficult. Like you said, regulation related to health reasons would probably be effective. In CommieFornia, you need to take a written test to purchase a firearm in a gun store. Why not just a mental screening? </p>

<p>It wasn&#39;t about the speed or efficiency of the weapon, it was about being able to match the speed and efficiency of the government&#39;s weapons. In a coup/civil war scenario, what good is having a bunch of citizens with handguns and shotguns when you have a military with fully automatic high power high capacity long range rifles?</p>

<p>As someone who is on board with background checks, the idea of mental health screenings is a completely different and potentially terrifying gun control measure. Sure, it starts off with good intentions. But who&#39;s to say what qualifies as mentally stable enough for gun ownership? Who will have the ability to expand those powers? How long until being a &quot;conspiracy theorist&quot; or anti-government is labeled as a &quot;mental illness&quot; and disqualifies you from being granted (or maintaining) lawful gun ownership? It is a truly slippery slope. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The people can still have drones! Obviously not military grade predator drones, but regular ones would certainly help (for things like recon and strategy). </p>

<p>I get scared when they try to start outlawing things for citizens, while buying more for the military or police forces, like body armor, explosives like grenades or launchers, or even tracer rounds.</p>

<p>At first glance, most people think that it makes total sense to not allow citizens to have explosives or RPGs... but if they are getting them lawfully, then what&#39;s the problem? If they break laws with them, they will be punished!</p>

<p>Not remotely.  It was written as a hard stopper to a tyrannical government.  The people didn&#39;t just have rifles, they had -cannons-, cannons that fired <strong>FOURTY TWO</strong> pound cannon balls.  </p>

<p>Truth is, your fear enables them.  Because if you make guns illegal, only criminals and tyrannical governments will have them.  </p>

<p>What if the amount of people screaming about Obama coming for our guns is the only reason he didn&#39;t come for guns?

<p>That&#39;s a poor argument. I could say the same about violent people, but it doesn&#39;t meant there&#39;s a real threat.</p>

<p>&quot;To say that <em>white supremacists</em> wouldn&#39;t <em>kill all non-whites</em> tomorrow if they thought they could get away with it is a ridiculous notion.&quot;</p>

<p>In this extreme case it&#39;s true. There&#39;s probably a bunch of people that would inflict harm on others if they thought they could get away with it, but they can&#39;t.</p>

<p>Guns are the same. It would be impossible to take guns away from law-abiding Americans, too, so that point is just as unrealistic.</p>

<p>Again, Obama increased gun ownership. People are just terrified, all the time, of everything. &quot;I need more guns!&quot;. &quot;Don&#39;t take my guns!&quot;.</p>

<p>So you agree then that there indeed ARE people who want to take away our guns, they just can&#39;t?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m saying it&#39;s not realistic to postulate why Obama didn&#39;t take the guns.. it wasn&#39;t for any of the assumptions you listed, but rather because Americans would never allow it.</p>

<p>My point is that Obama was never trying to take guns. The proof is that he didn&#39;t try, and he didn&#39;t take them away.</p>

<p>Furthermore, gun ownership <em>increased</em> under Obama. While this was not his fault, it happened under his watch. Surely it was driven by people thinking that guns were to be outlawed or banned soon, but the point is that under Obama there were more guns, not less.</p>

<p>Not only did he not try to take guns away, the total numbers increased while he was president.</p>

<p>In other words, no one is coming for your guns. They weren&#39;t before, and they aren&#39;t now. It isn&#39;t going to happen, period.</p>

<p>Seems to me like it would be much easier for TPTB to first just restrict WHERE you can have a gun, rather than WHO can have a gun.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I agree with everything you&#39;re saying, except your ending conclusion. They were before, and they are now... but it isn&#39;t going to happen, because Americans won&#39;t allow it.</p>

<p>How about after 20 more years of this CNN propaganda and fear mongering? These things are slow changes and don&#39;t happen over night. You&#39;re certainty on this issue makes me question how much you&#39;ve really looked into and/or considered the possibilities (not trying to be mean or rude here, just trying to have a conversation which I&#39;ve appreciated so far. Just FYI).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not trying to be rude either, just going back and forth ;-)</p>

<p>I don&#39;t doubt that there are groups of people, and organizations, that would like to ban certain types of guns, restrict ownership, implement background checks, etc. There certainly are, and some of them work tirelessly to push their agenda.</p>

<p>While I think common sense gun legislation can pass (ending gun shows, more background checks, etc.), I do not believe anyone will successfully ban guns, or take them away.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>While I tend to agree in general, I think this issue is unique:</p>

<p>The 2nd amendment and the rights it enshrines are too deeply ingrained in American culture and society. We&#39;re now at a point where there are two distinct camps, with others lying somewhere on the spectrum. Guns are either a god-given right, and essential to the protection of self, or they are a scourge on society that do more harm than good.</p>

<p>While a few people may be persuaded to join the other side, I think the vast majority of people will not be swayed. This of course is conjecture, but based on historical precedent and the current situation I think it&#39;s a safe assumption.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So, because people said Obama wanted to take guns away and he didn&#39;t, no one at all wants our guns and the whole thing is a lie created by gun manufacturers?</p>

<p>What if the amount of people screaming about Obama coming for our guns is the only reason he didn&#39;t come for guns? In general, the left (aka the MSM) has had a hard-on for anti-gun legislation and advocacy for years. To say that the Democratic party wouldn&#39;t take away all semi-automatic weapons tomorrow if they thought they could get away with it is a ridiculous notion.</p>

<p>The point of this whole post is to show that the left (in this case CNN, and the DA of NYC) will go so far as to blatantly lie to the people in order to further their own agenda&#39;s... which is to lesson the amount of guns. Period. Not &quot;get guns into the hands of law abiding citizens and out of the hands of criminals&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Guns are the same. It would be impossible to take guns away from law-abiding Americans, too, so that point is just as unrealistic.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So you agree then that there indeed ARE people who want to take away our guns, they just can&#39;t?</p>

<p>And Obama increased gun ownership because people were afriad of him taking their guns?</p>

<p>I&#39;m confused what you are trying to argue here.</p>
