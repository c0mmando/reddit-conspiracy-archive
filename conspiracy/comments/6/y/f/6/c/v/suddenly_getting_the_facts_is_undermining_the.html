        Rep. Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the panel, said the pair of subpoenas were issued over his objections last month and are designed to "undermine" the claims about the Trump campaign and the Kremlin.

      </blockquote>

       How could the truth undermine his claims unless he knows they are bogus?

       You are correct, my apologies. I'm wondering if Schiff said this because he knows the dossier is a little on the outrageous side and would make the real investigative work that they are doing look phony.

       What real investigative work? Everything they are doing leads back to the Podesta group and other democrats. They keeps switching the narrative of what exactly it is they are accusing Trump of, and then keep finding evidence of corruption and collusion on the democrat side.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Democrats have a louder voice in the press but they have no power in congress.

       Funny because I saw people making such a huge deal of the Awan arrest like three weeks ago, and since then, nothing. It's totally unrelated to Trump anyways but it's not like there are any new developments whatsoever.

       How was a non-archive link of CNN allowed? Curious. I thought those were banned.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyways, I think OP left out this key detail
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        House Intelligence Chairman Devin Nunes lashed out at Attorney General Jeff Sessions last week in a letter where he threatened Sessions with a public grilling if he doesn't produce documents about the Russia dossier to the House intelligence committee.
       </p>
       <p>
        In the letter, which was
        <strong>
         signed only by Nunes and no other members of the House intelligence committee
        </strong>
        , Nunes explained that he was extending the deadline for responding to the subpoenas to September 14.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Didn't Nunes recuse himself after he leaked classified material in broad daylight regarding the committee and now is under a house ethics investigation for that very act?
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, I would love for Jeff Sessions to testify again in public. Let him tell the public about all of the conversations he had with Kislyak at the Mayflower that he can't recall. Also would love to hear him testify about his Chief of Staff's attempts to set up meetings with Kremlin officials.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Senate Judiciary committee should be voting in the near future on releasing the 10 hr testimony from Glen Simpson. OP will be able to get all the truth he wants from that testimony.

       What did he leak? If you mean that he went and spoke to POTUS about what he saw, that's not leaking. POTUS has full clearance when it comes to classified information.

        <strong>
         Nunes:
        </strong>
        So first, I recently confirmed that on numerous occasions, the intelligence community incidentally collected information about U.S. citizens involved in the Trump transition. Details about persons associated with the incoming administration, details with little apparent foreign intelligence value were widely disseminated in intelligence community reporting. Third, I have confirmed that additional names of Trump transition team members were unmasked. And forth and finally, I want to be clear, none of this surveillance was related to Russia, or the investigation of Russian activities, or of the Trump team.
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         Reporter:
        </strong>
        And was the president also part of that incidental collection?
       </p>

         Nunes:
        </strong>
        Yes â€¦ yes.

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Nunes in broad daylight confirmed that the President of the United States had communications incidentally collected by FISA warrants. I don't see how that is not leaking classified intelligence. FISA communications are some of the most highly classified intel that the US has.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also want to put out there that Carter Page, a member of the Trump Campaign's foreign policy team, was under a FISA warrant during the 2016 campaign because he was recruited as a foreign agent of Russia back in 2013. The FISA intel would have likely come from that warrant.

       Yes. Unmasking does not have anything to do with declassifying information to the level that you can disclose to the public. Unless there was a change to the FISA law that I do not know about.

       <p>
        Section 402 requires the DNI to: (1) conduct a declassification review of each decision, order, or opinion issued by the FISA court or the FISA court of review that includes a significant construction or interpretation of any provision of law, including any novel or significant construction or interpretation of "specific selection term" as defined in this Act; and (2) make such decisions, orders, or opinions publicly available to the greatest extent practicable, subject to permissible redactions.
       </p>
       <p>
        Authorizes the DNI to waive such review and public availability requirements if: (1) a waiver is necessary to protect the national security of the United States or properly classified intelligence sources or methods, and (2) an unclassified statement prepared by the Attorney General is made publicly available to summarize the significant construction or interpretation of law.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Only the DNI can declassify material from FISA and a public letter must be prepared by the AG. Devin Nunes produced none of these documents when he disclosed the information.

       I'd like to know about this. Considering all the kerfluffle about the Mods thing, I'd like to know if this was one of the points of contention that led to the coup attempt.

       You submitted a link straight to CNN, but the OP of this post posted the link in the text of a self-post. Auto-mod probably only picks up Link Posts.

       Not gonna lie I was kind of confused at seeing the link at first as well, so you're not alone there. Wasn't until I looked over at your test post that I realised the difference.
