       Report was released awhile ago.  University of Alaska Fairbanks has an amazing engineering program and care largely about oil and oil field related degrees. This is a generalization of course, however those are the things the school is known for. I don't claim to understand the legitimacy of the claims made in this report, however consider the source.

       ...Care to explain?  You could say "Instead of attempting to discredit the source, maybe you should take a look at the data and methodology and find problems there." instead of writing it off with the standard "I don't like what you're saying so you must not be a real person".  That might be more productive.

       And yet, for months, they have been saying it would be released in August.  And now, for some strange reason, pointing this out makes one a shill and/or paid agent.

       Yea.  Shoot me for wanting a scientific research project which promised access to their full data to act like a science research project which promised access to their full data.

       What a load of shite. Dr. Hulsey has plainly and repeatedly stated that the work isn't done yet, and he doesn't want to release it until it is. You can't fault him, his team, or UAF for that. Give it a fucking rest.

       I can fault them for not allowing others in their field to see the work.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can fault them for building up hype that they would release such data in August then not doing so.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why are you protecting them so?
      </p>
      <p>
       Why doesn't there history of not following their statements with actions and least make you want to ask question?  Instead you attack those that do.
      </p>
      <p>
       BTW is the project officially affiliated with the university or is it simply that he works for UAF and used one of their presentation facilities?

       This hoax stuff is pushed to delegitimize the 9/11 truth movement. Like flat earth is pushed to delegitimize criticism of NASA.
      </p>
      <p>
       People certainly died on 9/11, probably less than the official story claims, but it really doesn't matter. Whether what hit the buildings were planes or not is also irrelevant.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact is that the buildings were standing before 9/11, and were not standing after. The building collapses could not possibly have been caused by fire as per the official story. Controlled demolition is the only reasonable possibility. This is the most obvious truth that must be exposed, and this is where the 9/11 truth movement must maintain focus.

       Correct. This event was a progress report about their initial findings. There is still more work to do before releasing the draft report in Oct/Nov. Then there will be a review and edit phase, and the final report will be published in 2018. Data will be published, peer reviews will happen, etc. Apparently their emails keep people up on the news reasonably well. (I'm not a subscriber.)

        Technique #1 - 'FORUM SLIDING'
       </p>
       <p>
        If a very sensitive posting of a critical nature has been posted on a forum - it can be quickly removed from public view by 'forum sliding.' In this technique a number of unrelated posts are quietly prepositioned on the forum and allowed to 'age.' Each of these misdirectional forum postings can then be called upon at will to trigger a 'forum slide.' The second requirement is that several fake accounts exist, which can be called upon, to ensure that this technique is not exposed to the public. To trigger a 'forum slide' and 'flush' the critical post out of public view it is simply a matter of logging into each account both real and fake and then 'replying' to prepositined postings with a simple 1 or 2 line comment. This brings the unrelated postings to the top of the forum list, and the critical posting 'slides' down the front page, and quickly out of public view. Although it is difficult or impossible to censor the posting it is now lost in a sea of unrelated and unuseful postings. By this means it becomes effective to keep the readers of the forum reading unrelated and non-issue items.

       If Richard Gage is using AE911Truth's funds to buy Dr. Wood's book, and Richard Gage is suppressing Dr. Wood's work, one must conclude that the prime directive of AE911Truth is to suppress the evidence. Mr. Gage cannot refute the overwhelming, conclusive, and indisputable evidence contained in Dr. Wood's book but only misrepresent it (i.e. promote disinformation about it). Science is not determined by popular opinion, but a psyop is. Referring to the sum of 2+3=5 as "a view" or as "an opinion" or "a theory" is how cover-ups work. It creates doubt where there is no doubt.

      <p>
       If Mr. Gage was searching for the truth, then he would not be trying to deceive his supporters and the American people by claiming to present the best "scientific forensic evidence", only to completely ignore the large sum of scientific forensic evidence that thermite does not explain. If a scientist or researcher only presented the evidence that supports their hypothesis while completely ignoring the evidence that countered their hypothesis, they could be stripped of their professional license or degree for presenting such an unscientific and biased fraction of the total sum of important physical evidence that demands consideration.

       i think the reason because its fairly quiet is just that now a university has confirmed (well not really confirmed, just opinionated) that it was not the way NIST said. something that most of us have known since 2001. so its not really grande news, its just one more check in the checklist for it being a inside job

       They didn't release the report nor did they release the data sets and models like they promised to release.  So, in my opinion, what id deafening is all the supporters who refuse to call them out on their failure to keep their promises.

       Keep in mind NIST didn't release there model data as because of public safety, I rarely see anyone call them out for that.  At least they said they will release it in the next couple months.

       First time in history steel builds have a total symmetric failure due to "fire" (oh yeah on the same day) and NIST won't release data due to safety concerns.  If these were real engineering failures AND our understanding of physics is totally wrong, building safety codes should have been completely changed...no such changes have happened in spite of NIST's findings.

       They knew before August they would not make the August release data and didn't tell anyone.  When the did release in September it didn't contain 10% of what they said they would release in August.

       I'm guessing your not interested in telling me where you stand on WTC 7?  I definitely question the collapse of WTC 7 and the fact that NIST won't release their data throws up a huge red flag IMO.  I look forward to when they release there data and hopefully it's scrutinized, unlike NIST's :-(.

       BTW, I don't really need any details, I'm just curious where you stand on WTC 7.  Do you agree with NIST's findings, Do you think it was brought down by explosives, or do you think it was something else?  I don't even like debating the collapse, I personally focus on the foreknowledge and the geo-political fallout from 9/11 to argue at the least the US government allowed it to happen.

       You're saying they are no better than NIST who said they will never realse their data on they're models.  In my mind you're trying to vilify them because they said they're postponing their release.  Never releasing ≠ delaying the release.

        You're saying they are no better than NIST who said they will never release the data on their models... 8 years ago. In my mind you're trying to vilify them because they said they're postponing their release. Never releasing ≠ delaying the release.

       They said they would release them in August.

      <p>
       They didn't.

      <p>
       They will not even let people in their own field of study see the data so why, exactly, should they be given a pass?

       Right, I forgot, research projects always follow their planned timetables and have never had delays. They haven't released their findings because

        they aren't done yet

       They've already released one batch of data, it's linked right on the front of their page at the bottom. 1.1G zip file, have you looked through it yet? I don't know how many times I can say that
       <em>
        they're not done with the modeling yet therefore they can't release the full modeling data. There were delays
       </em>
       . When they started the project they originally said they'd be finished in April, but no one bitched when they pushed that date back.

       Considering they called out the NIST report on AT LEAST 3 major issues, and came to a conclusion that fire didn't cause the collaps, and admitted that they needed &lt;1month to release the completed detailed filings, I'm willing to let it go a bit because the dude is a professional.

       Typically I'd say if you enjoy it, knock yourself out! However, my thoughts changed since reading up on how this keeps useful info and discussions out of public view, keeps people focused on unrelated and non-productive issues (thereby wasting time that could be invested in useful dialogue and information sharing), and overall demoralizes / drives away people who might learn and participate. (All that being said… I've done it myself far too often. ;)

       I agree, please, really please, check my history.  I chose a couple weels ago to cut to the arguement and leave the BS out.  It's what I do now.  Notice the people I'm argueing with don't seem to take issue with NIST never releasing there data but only hate on U of A?  I watch them, believe that.

       Here is one of the talking points I'm looking for in the near future:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        And isn't it this just a few professors who work for U of A that are releasing this? What evidence is there that the University sponsors it?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       They'll probably start attacking the professors as they get closer.  Although I agree, It's unfortunate they have pushed back the release.  Although as I say often, "can't rush perfection"... I hope.

       The UAF is conducting this finite element model analysis because of what NIST concluded. Especially because their data is sealed and their analysis omitted crucial elements.

       Why do you want a forensic engineer and his team to rush results out instead of making their conclusions as sound as possible? Worrying about a few months in a timeline seems silly considering your lack of concern for the official report which was released 7 years after 9/11. There's 3 people working on the UAF project, with fewer resources, less money and support than the official report had. Give them a break...

       Do you not question NIST choose to say they won't release their model data a year after their report?  It's the msm's explanation of what happened and you choose to attack U of A Fairbanks for delaying their release... Can you show me one of your comment's where you attacked NIST for delaying a year and then deciding not to release their data?  I know I can!

       Look up Richard Gage on the California Architects board website. Look up his practice. What buildings has he worked on in the last 16 years? It's telling that the leaders of this movement aren't working or are retired, or teaching. And soliciting donations.

       Someone on another post who is signed up for their emails said that they've been very transparent and said months ago that they wouldn't hit the August date. The event yesterday was a status update with initial findings and the draft report will be published in Oct/Nov, followed by a comment/edit phase, and then the final report next year.

       I mentioned this before but it's worth repeating.  Todays society is tuned for what is in the now that we can barely give two wet shits about what happened yesterday, let alone 16 years ago.  Add to the mix that this is a highly controversial topic where mainstream people dare not go against the narrative:  Is it any wonder that all you hear are crickets?
      </p>
      <p>
       Look at what is happening with the Kennedy Assassination FOIA.  The FBI is literally giving out paper evidence showing the Warren Commission was wrong and ..... yup...no one cares.  That was WAAAY to loong ago.  "So what..the FBI shows there was more than one shooter...Who cares...That's all hokus pokus anyhow..."
      </p>
      <p>
       I literally get that from friends and family.  That story lost its shine a generation ago.  911 is on the same path...No one will care and the longer we wait to see and experience the truth, the less people will care even when the answers are put right in front of them.
      </p>
      <p>
       I found myself the other day explaining building 7 to blue pilled family members and I knew after a few sentences in that it was not going to be a productive conversation.  It's sad, too, because they are science minded people who believe in the truth but its un-american to say that WTC7 fell into its own footprint at freefall speed due to office fires.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's really depressing and it's really sad that posts like this one will also fade away no matter how much the red-pilled crowd votes up or agrees or ....
      </p>
      <p>
       I won't give up and I won't allow people to try and convince me otherwise.  The science is there.  The evidence is now clear but undoing the story as told by NIST will take a fucking lifetime of shouting.

       NIST did none of this, yet they were actually tasked with investigating the collapses of the 3 towers. Funded by the millions in tax payer money, but we can't see their data sets. UAFs analysis was also conducted in half the amount of time with less resources and personnel.

       The UAF is conducting this finite element model analysis because of what NIST concluded. Especially because their data is sealed and their analysis omitted crucial elements.

       Why do you want a forensic engineer and his team to rush results out instead of making their conclusions as sound as possible? Worrying about a few months in a timeline seems silly considering your lack of concern for the official report which was released 7 years after 9/11. There's 3 people working on the UAF project, with fewer resources, less money and support than the official report had. Give them a break...

        Why does NIST matter in regards to holding these people to what they said they would do?

       Do you not question NIST choose to say they won't release their model data a year after their report?  It's the msm's explanation of what happened and you choose to attack U of A Fairbanks for delaying their release... Can you show me one of your comment's where you attacked NIST for delaying a year and then deciding not to release their data?  I know I can!

        I'm guessing your not interested in telling me where you stand on WTC 7. I definitely question the collapse of WTC 7 and the fact that NIST won't release their data throws up a huge red flag IMO. I look forward to when U of A release their data and hopefully it's scrutinized, unlike NIST who's to scared for the public's safety to release it :-(.

       That doesn't make any sense nor can I respond to a statement that keeps being edited.  Report without the editing and I will post details.
