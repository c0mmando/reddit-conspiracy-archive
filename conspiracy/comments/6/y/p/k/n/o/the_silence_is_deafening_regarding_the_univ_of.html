<p>And yet, for months, they have been saying it would be released in August.  And now, for some strange reason, pointing this out makes one a shill and/or paid agent.  </p>

<p>I can fault them for not allowing others in their field to see the work.</p>

<p>I can fault them for building up hype that they would release such data in August then not doing so.</p>

<p>Why are you protecting them so?  </p>

<p>Why doesn&#39;t there history of not following their statements with actions and least make you want to ask question?  Instead you attack those that do.</p>

<p>BTW is the project officially affiliated with the university or is it simply that he works for UAF and used one of their presentation facilities?  </p>

<p>I like your naive optimism. The reality is that almost nobody cares. If they did care, they would have paid attention to the footage at the tie and realised it was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byLj3U6tQZA">obviously fake</a>. We live in amazing times. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This hoax stuff is pushed to delegitimize the 9/11 truth movement. Like flat earth is pushed to delegitimize criticism of NASA.</p>

<p>People certainly died on 9/11, probably less than the official story claims, but it really doesn&#39;t matter. Whether what hit the buildings were planes or not is also irrelevant.</p>

<p>The fact is that the buildings were standing before 9/11, and were not standing after. The building collapses could not possibly have been caused by fire as per the official story. Controlled demolition is the only reasonable possibility. This is the most obvious truth that must be exposed, and this is where the 9/11 truth movement must maintain focus.</p>

<p>Technique #1 - &#39;FORUM SLIDING&#39;</p>

<p>If a very sensitive posting of a critical nature has been posted on a forum - it can be quickly removed from public view by &#39;forum sliding.&#39; In this technique a number of unrelated posts are quietly prepositioned on the forum and allowed to &#39;age.&#39; Each of these misdirectional forum postings can then be called upon at will to trigger a &#39;forum slide.&#39; The second requirement is that several fake accounts exist, which can be called upon, to ensure that this technique is not exposed to the public. To trigger a &#39;forum slide&#39; and &#39;flush&#39; the critical post out of public view it is simply a matter of logging into each account both real and fake and then &#39;replying&#39; to prepositined postings with a simple 1 or 2 line comment. This brings the unrelated postings to the top of the forum list, and the critical posting &#39;slides&#39; down the front page, and quickly out of public view. Although it is difficult or impossible to censor the posting it is now lost in a sea of unrelated and unuseful postings. By this means it becomes effective to keep the readers of the forum reading unrelated and non-issue items.</p>

<p>If Richard Gage is using AE911Truth&#39;s funds to buy Dr. Wood&#39;s book, and Richard Gage is suppressing Dr. Wood&#39;s work, one must conclude that the prime directive of AE911Truth is to suppress the evidence. Mr. Gage cannot refute the overwhelming, conclusive, and indisputable evidence contained in Dr. Wood&#39;s book but only misrepresent it (i.e. promote disinformation about it). Science is not determined by popular opinion, but a psyop is. Referring to the sum of 2+3=5 as &quot;a view&quot; or as &quot;an opinion&quot; or &quot;a theory&quot; is how cover-ups work. It creates doubt where there is no doubt.</p>

<p>If Mr. Gage was searching for the truth, then he would not be trying to deceive his supporters and the American people by claiming to present the best &quot;scientific forensic evidence&quot;, only to completely ignore the large sum of scientific forensic evidence that thermite does not explain. If a scientist or researcher only presented the evidence that supports their hypothesis while completely ignoring the evidence that countered their hypothesis, they could be stripped of their professional license or degree for presenting such an unscientific and biased fraction of the total sum of important physical evidence that demands consideration.</p>

<p>Source for that?  Given they keep saying they are going to release models and haven&#39;t done so that gives me pause.</p>

When they started the project they originally said they&#39;d be finished in April, but no one bitched when they pushed that date back.</p>

<p>They&#39;ll probably start attacking the professors as they get closer.  Although I agree, It&#39;s unfortunate they have pushed back the release.  Although as I say often, &quot;can&#39;t rush perfection&quot;... I hope.</p>

<p>Why do you want a forensic engineer and his team to rush results out instead of making their conclusions as sound as possible? Worrying about a few months in a timeline seems silly considering your lack of concern for the official report which was released 7 years after 9/11. There&#39;s 3 people working on the UAF project, with fewer resources, less money and support than the official report had. Give them a break...</p>

<p>Do you not question NIST choose to say they won&#39;t release their model data a year after their report?  It&#39;s the msm&#39;s explanation of what happened and you choose to attack U of A Fairbanks for delaying their release...

    <div class="md"><p>I mentioned this before but it&#39;s worth repeating.  Todays society is tuned for what is in the now that we can barely give two wet shits about what happened yesterday, let alone 16 years ago.  Add to the mix that this is a highly controversial topic where mainstream people dare not go against the narrative:  Is it any wonder that all you hear are crickets?  </p>

<p>Look at what is happening with the Kennedy Assassination FOIA.  The FBI is literally giving out paper evidence showing the Warren Commission was wrong and ..... yup...no one cares.  That was WAAAY to loong ago.  &quot;So what..the FBI shows there was more than one shooter...Who cares...That&#39;s all hokus pokus anyhow...&quot;  </p>

<p>I literally get that from friends and family.  That story lost its shine a generation ago.  911 is on the same path...No one will care and the longer we wait to see and experience the truth, the less people will care even when the answers are put right in front of them.  </p>

<p>I found myself the other day explaining building 7 to blue pilled family members and I knew after a few sentences in that it was not going to be a productive conversation.  It&#39;s sad, too, because they are science minded people who believe in the truth but its un-american to say that WTC7 fell into its own footprint at freefall speed due to office fires.  </p>

<p>It&#39;s really depressing and it&#39;s really sad that posts like this one will also fade away no matter how much the red-pilled crowd votes up or agrees or .... </p>

<p>I won&#39;t give up and I won&#39;t allow people to try and convince me otherwise.  The science is there.  The evidence is now clear but undoing the story as told by NIST will take a fucking lifetime of shouting.   </p>

<p>They made it clear they would release them in August too.</p>

<p>Why does NIST matter in regards to holding these people to what they said they would do?</p>

<p>Why do you want a forensic engineer and his team to rush results out instead of making their conclusions as sound as possible? </p>

<p>The UAF is conducting this finite element model analysis because of what NIST concluded. Especially because their data is sealed and their analysis omitted crucial elements. Have you watched either NIST or UAF presentations? Your statement is somehow hilarious considering the whole premise of the UAF project is based upon what NIST did...</p>

<p>Why do you want a forensic engineer and his team to rush results out instead of making their conclusions as sound as possible? Worrying about a few months in a timeline seems silly considering your lack of concern for the official report which was released 7 years after 9/11. There&#39;s 3 people working on the UAF project, with fewer resources, less money and support than the official report had. Give them a break...</p>

<p>Do you not question NIST choose to say they won&#39;t release their model data a year after their report?  It&#39;s the msm&#39;s explanation of what happened and you choose to attack U of A Fairbanks for delaying their release... Can you show me one of your comment&#39;s where you attacked NIST for delaying a year and then deciding not to release their data?  I know I can!</p>

<p>I&#39;m guessing your not interested in telling me where you stand on WTC 7. I definitely question the collapse of WTC 7 and the fact that NIST won&#39;t release their data throws up a huge red flag IMO. I look forward to when U of A release their data and hopefully it&#39;s scrutinized, unlike NIST who&#39;s to scared for the public&#39;s safety to release it :-(.</p>

<p>That doesn&#39;t make any sense nor can I respond to a statement that keeps being edited.  Report without the editing and I will post details.</p>
