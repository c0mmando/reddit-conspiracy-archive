       The trailer looked decent, if it had good reviews I would have seen it... except tom cruise is in it.

       Narcos on Netflix has been great. It doesn't shy away from the fact that our DEA and especially CIA was fucking shit up, and the US politicians were clueless, and most of their policies and motives were just to look good to the American people, when in reality it just made South America worst off.

       About a month ago I was just living in Medellin, Bogota and Cali for six months.  I didn't research it much but I just got a general feeling for the place and I can definitely see the strong CIA connection there now.  For example, Whatsapp is by far and large the primary way that people communicate now to the point that I think that normal voice calls must be a small minority.  So Facebook bought Whatsapp and of course the CIA at the absolute least has deep hooks into Facebook and possibly even more depending on your view of it.  There is a suspicious pricing model there where text messages are absurdly expensive, even more than the normal price gouging and specific services like Whatsapp are given special data rates.  They have basically funneled everyone into a CIA asset that really circumvents any sort of local control.  Then next door is Ecuador using dollars and Venezuela with the CIA up in their business.  Now I don't subscribe to the idea that its all the CIA's fault since I think that Venezuela has done far more damage to itself with its stupid price fixing strategies than the CIA could ever have dreamed about from a distance.  But anyways, yep, CIA all up in that business.  Oh sure the Narcos series was quite good but they really seemed to downplay any CIA involvement to what like just some guy who happens to be in the important places at the right time.  I just think that it was so much more than that.  Also Escobar's brother saying that yes Escobar was directly dealing with the CIA for a time until whatever went wrong with the relationship.

       The veil is being lifted.
 FX (The Cable Channel) just had the season 1 finale of Snow Fall. The story of how the CIA helped distribute coke into Southern Cal, leading to the west coast crack epidemic. Rest in peace Michael Ruppert .

       One of my favorite YouTube clips ever is Ruppert telling the CIA director that he had personally witnessed the Agency dealing drugs for years and the crowd erupting in applause. It was amazing.

       Yes and no. It seems like he was pretty depressed at the time, so it totally could have been a legit suicide, but it's also a little shady given his past.

       If it was an assassination, it was incredibly well executed.  2 notes, one written informally to friends and family and one that read like a police report.  Made arrangements for his beloved dog, and the owner of the land he was living on.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's just a tragedy.  A man with a unbridled passion for exposing corruption and lifting up his fellow man, who couldn't live with what he knew and continue to be largely ignored.  Screaming at the top of your lungs for justice takes a toll when no one listens.

       He killed himself two months after Apocalypse, Man was released. In it, he mentions how his plan was to either die (when he moved to southern California) or kill himself, so we know that he didn't have an aversion for suicide at least at one point in his life.

       I was shaking my head when he was living in Sebastopol and talking about how great it was.  I just knew that he was living in an escapist hyper-liberal hippy bubble and that it wasn't the right medicine and that nothing good was going to come from it.  I know Sebastopol well enough and IMO he should have gone to a far Eastern post-Soviet society to get the right sort of medicine that he was desperately needing.  I think that actually a darker, stoic, more cynical and intellectual environment would have been just so much better for him than a fake bubbly jive talking enclave.  Then next thing you know he was I believe out in some desert and then spinning into deep depression and then offed himself.

       He was running guns and drugs (Medellin Cartel) under the name Ellis Mackenzie.  He got caught in a Florida with a lot of quaaludes.  He decided to turn informant and he was able to get a picture of Pablo Escobar loading come into a plane in Nicuaragua.  He was assisted by a shadowy figure in the Nicuraguan government by the name of Federico Vaughn.  The CIA (most likely, Oliver North) leaked the pics and thus blew Seal's cover, thus signing his death warrant.

       This movie was originally going to be released around the election and it went by the name "Mena" the thing here is, is that when you searched "mena" you found out all about how the whole story of drug running is linked to bill clinton. it was not a surprise when the movie was pushed back like 10 months and had the name changed.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was slated for jan 6. 2017, the adds would have been running right before the actual election.

       No indication anything was changed because of the Clintons.
      </p>
      <p>
       In fact, when you search Mena and read about it there's nothing that matches up with that claim about it all tying to the Clintons. It was apparently going on since at least 1980, which means it goes to every president from Reagan on.

       He was the governor of Arkansas from 1979-81, then again from 1983-92.  Mena is a city in Arkansas in which drugs were allegedly flown into from Central America while Clinton was the governor.
      </p>
      <p>
       I just googled "Mena Clinton" and all of the results are related to the Clintons having a hand in running drugs through Mena, Arkansas.  Some were from reputable sources like [

       Leah Remini has stated that Tom Cruise is the leader of Scientology. In the past, Scientology has been antagonistic toward certain elements of the government, to the point of placing
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Snow_White">
        thousands
       </a>
       of infiltrators into a wide variety of offices.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't be fooled into thinking, however, that Scientology is good. They engage in brainwashing, threaten and intimidate whistleblowers, and have been accused of a number of murders.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is essentially infighting by bad people, like when the CIA sent Edward Snowden to infiltrate the NSA and get them in trouble because they were spying on ousted CIA director David Petraeus.

       That's what I had always thought too, but I'd be curious if Leah was saying otherwise. Cruise just seemed like the guy that was supposed to make Scientology seem more normal to the rest of America. It helps fool people into thinking it can't be that bad if a popular actor is part of the organization.

       I haven't seen her show but I did watch her interview with Joe Rogan, who may be the worst interviewer ever. In it, and in the interview with Miscavige's father, they made it sound like Tom gets huge benefits and his personal slaves and a lot of authority, but Miscavige sits on the throne and pulls the strings, and his spot is unassailable because he made them a real religion in the eyes of govt. That was my impression. And I'm not at all pretending to be on the up w Scientology but didn't Miscavige just "find" new documents for them, also? He has the ability to add and ratify new text, apparently. Pretty easy when you just make shit up, but still seems to point to him as the leader.

       Miscavige has decades of recorded dirt on Tom Cruise from the 'auditing' process where Scientologists confess their darkest secrets to an interrogator. Tom Cruise might not have access to those recordings of Miscavige's sessions, that leverage probably keeps Tom Cruise loyal to the church, and subordinate to Miscavige.

       I don't know of any good write ups. You have to just look at the timeline on it. Snowden jumped from CIA to NSA very soon after Petraeus went down. Petraeus was caught because they went digging on an unrelated warrant and "found" the information.
      </p>
      <p>
       One pattern to look for in any case is when the police initiate some kind of investigation that goes nowhere, but they stumble across totally unrelated crimes. The majority of the time, it means they were doing something like illegally wiretapping the person and trying to bring the illegally collected information in without giving away the illegal tap.

       Not a limited hang out.
      </p>
      <p>
       A limited hang out would be if they got caught running a small amount of cocaine, and admitted to it, and said that it was limited to a small amount of agents and that those agents and their command would be duly fired/punished/etc, and that "the CIA would never do that again" (when, in reality, not only are they running 1000x times the amount of cocaine that they got caught with, as well as running a similarly enormous amount of heroin/fentanyl/methamphetamine).

       Hi
      </p>
      <p>
       I think nearly all movies are created with a deeper meaning as to discredit these events when they happen Irl. For example if this movie played out Irl and u were to tell someone about it, there first thought would be of this movie and say things like that only happen in movies. Is that considered as limited hangout? Thanks

       Possibly.
      </p>
      <p>
       One thing gets me with that one though. Sure, Kubrick is famous. But if his film was really so damning that they were willing to kill him, and (at least some of) the people involved are extremely powerful people in Hollywood, well surely they could have used said power to prevent said movie from being released, could they not?
      </p>
      <p>
       After killing him, they'd just need to pause production "due to his death" (justifiable). Then months/years later, just say it didn't play well with test audiences, proceed to NOT release it on any media whatsoever, and nuke the original film. Problem solved. Sure there may be rumors of a "lost kubrick flick" or some such. Maybe even some short clips and/or still images "leak out". But that's all.

       I find it hard to believe that he was able to hide the plot from them. Details, sure. But they had to know it was about them. There were too many people involved for there not to be a leak. Why wait to see just how damning it was before defending yourself?

       Kubrick died 666 days before the year 2001, and 666 days after the first time a computer defeated a chess grand master.

       There were reportedly a shit ton of edits done at the last minute once Kubrick was out of the picture. Maybe they made it more toothless.

       Killing a director and movie simultaneously would probably look too fishy. Also movies are bound up in contracts and schedules, and need to make money.

       Fuck that really aggravates me. Kubrick was one of those special talents in film industry. The list of people that have been eliminated by the illuminati is crazy. Shit is Fucking bullshit I jus found out the other day bill hicks was kilt by the illuminati. Parasites of humanity rest in power Kubrick.

       it's part of what they do, put it right in front you.  it also serves to essentially give them permission because they can say they told you before they even did it.  it also functions to make whatever subject normalized. you become desensitized to seeing this information and will write it off or claim it's conspiracy theory.

       Its amazing isnt it(well not really) how all the corruption is all out there for everyone to see. You dont even have to dig that far. In fact, toleration of corruption and criminal actions are just normalized. Its what we expect from government especially the federal government. Meanwhile, people get all upset about racial issues,gender,class issues anything that seperates us out instead of issues  that ALL people can coalesce under do something about like corruption in government, corrupt two party system,lose of rights, the CIA,DEA,FBI running drugs all over the americas  etc etc if they just cared to improve this country THOSE issues would be in the forefront  but people could care less about. Its sad and pathetic

       My first thought was that you could have given more information outside of just "Thoughts?".
      </p>
      <p>
       My second thought is that it is absolutely ridiculous for any person to deny that the CIA runs drugs. And once you go down that rabbit hole, well, the whole narrative falls apart. Which is likely why most people continue denying - they like their world view just the way it is.

       No it's the opposite. CIA is now synonymous with drug-running and very shady dealings so instead they are now just going with it in order to normalize illicit CIA activity as something to accepted and expected by US citizens.

       Other than Tom Cruise is starring in a movie that is literally about the CIA and it's drug running program? I think
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       will believe it's some kind of eye opener for "the sheep". Other than that, it's just a movie that has been done before. What do all movies have in common? They're made to keep people interested for 90 minutes, and this one will probably do a decent job of making money.

       It gives a good portrayal of how the corrupt destroy those that expose them. Those complicit in that smear campaign should be charged with accessory to murder, because it drove the man to suicide.

       They do this because the Barry Seal case is now old. It gives the viewer the impression that "This is the kind of thing that USED to happen."  When the reality is that there is considerable evidence that the US Government has been involved in the illegal drug trade for decades and there's absolutely no reason they would ever back out of it because it's too profitable and supports the US economy.

       Mike Rupert made his career on this information. Many, many well cited books have been written since Vietnam to now, detailing the nature of the problem.

       MPAA always has a former US government official in charge of it &amp; its ratings system literally determines how many people can see certain films.  Currently former Senator Chris Dodd is at the helm last time i checked.  Jack Valenti was in charge for a long time &amp; that fuck was on Air Force One when LBJ was sworn in.  I think scientology is some sort of government program.  John Travolta has a fucking 747 or some shit like that &amp; even flew to Hati after the quake &amp; has a house in FL next to the largest private runway(i think in the world).  Imagine the possibilities.

       Yes and no. It seems like he was pretty depressed at the time, so it totally could have been a legit suicide, but it's also a little shady given his past.
