    <div class="md"><p>Mr. TrumpIsATranny...</p>

<p>I think pointing out shills and brigading going on does a great amount of good.</p>

<p>It adds value to the discussion, in that people who are aware of the shills won&#39;t waste their time talking to them.</p>

<p>What exactly do you mean about &quot;someone better at Reddit than me?&quot;  All you do is submit something interesting for others to read... you failed on that point.  Honestly, there&#39;s nothing interesting here.</p>

<p>So, TrumpIsATranny is here asking for moderator help with a system that he admittedly isn&#39;t very good at.</p>

<p>And you wonder why people think there are shills.</p>

<p>Do you really wonder why people complain about the brigading?  Do you really?</p>

<p>Shills don&#39;t bother me.  I know, at the end of the day, they have to live with themselves, and that can&#39;t be easy.  Being a traitor to the country is one thing; lying to yourself is doesn&#39;t have the same legal penalties, but can&#39;t be easy to live with.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Probably not.</p>

<p>Now, of course we both know President Trump spoke at length, on multiple occasions, about Syrian refugees.  That&#39;s the obvious counter example to your claim.</p>

<p>And, it doesn&#39;t need to be proven.  It is and it is proven.  You can verify it or not.  You don&#39;t have to be correct.  You shouldn&#39;t be obnoxious though.  If you don&#39;t fit in somewhere, then you are like that religious guy handing out pamphlets on the side of the road.

<p>What i should have said is he only singled out anchor babies from ethic groups he could use to role up his base. By providing Syrians as an example only furthers my point so thank you for that friend. </p>

<p>Wonder why someone who you agree with wouldn&#39;t be a shill for doing nothing other than screaming for proof when that is exactly what you just said indicated shillness?? </p>

<ol>
<li><p>Didn&#39;t ask to be shown this BS for years on end</p></li>
<li><p>Were relegated here as a place they can discuss the news.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Someone coming in and just asking for proof, or using deconstructionist arguments, instead of discussing the news, has an agenda.</p>

<p>One group has an agenda.  Another group has an interest.</p>

<p>Now saying President Trump is a racist is absolutely silly.  That dog don&#39;t hunt.  Take Kanye West as an example.  He was quick for calling out GWB for not giving a lick about black people.  Know what he said about Donald Trump?  He stopped one of his sold out concerts, gave a twenty minute stump speech for Trump to the black people of LA, and then ended his tour.</p>

<p>If you asked Morgan Freeman, who the racist are, he would tell you they are the people who keep bring up race.</p>

<p>If you want to stop racism, then stop talking about race.</p>

<p>We have a nation.  Our nation has borders.  It has laws.  That&#39;s not racist.  That&#39;s citizenry.  That&#39;s civilization.  That&#39;s society.</p>

<p>But, to make it about race???  That is the racism!</p>

<p>BS.  I engaged in discussion.  You refuse to.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And I still don&#39;t get how the person who wanted proof trump singled out only specific ethnic groups</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There&#39;s your racism again :(</p>

<p>You came here and made a post because you are upset people called you a shill (or you did it for other reasons, under the guise that you are not taken seriously).</p>

<p>Here&#39;s the thing; Clinton lost.  Hillary Clinton is a failed political candidate.  Lets try the present-progressive.  Hillary Clinton is a failure.  That&#39;s her legacy.  She lost.  She will never win.  As much as it may pain you, Trump will be President of the US for another seven and a half years.  Then, Ivonka will probably become the first female president.</p>

<p>It&#39;s funny you call Trump an trannie, when Clinton is so butch.</p>

<p>Trump whipped her ass too.  Soundly defeated her.  She felt entitled, and she is a failure.  Let be very clear about that.</p>

<p>If you want to avoid being called a shill, or if you want to avoid claims of brigading, will you are going to have to put a little bit more effort into your participation.</p>

<p>To succinctly answer your question, does non-stop complaints about the actual and real brigading of this Internet forum (yeah, it&#39;s a glorified link dump), raises awareness about the actual brigading.  So, yeah, it&#39;s absolutely worth while.</p>

<p>What you will find though, is brigading or shilling-about, will give you a net-negative effect.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s the thing.  You have an overt lack of interest in things that are </p>

<ol>
<li><p>interesting</p></li>
<li><p>on the forum you are visiting and criticizing</p></li>
</ol>

<p>That along is enough to get you called out as a shill.  You are here and you are upset.  You don&#39;t have to be here and you don&#39;t have to be upset.  It&#39;s a choice you made.</p>

<p>I&#39;m here because I want to read deeper into the news.</p>

<p>Why are you here?  To imply that I&#39;m racist?  To insult the duly elected leader of our country?</p>

<p>Do you see the problem?  If not, then you have big problems.</p>

<p>BTW, jamesrandiisatranny!</p>

<p>Have a nice day</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Shill would typically imply some sort of financial incentive.</p>

<p>Brigading usually implies mob mentality, but I imagine could be included under the definition of trolling.</p>

<p>Realistically though, this is the internet. If someone finds troll and shill accusations bothersome and doesn&#39;t want to use the filtering options I&#39;d recommend reading and writing books instead.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In regards to brigading it seems like a fairly obvious solution to enable and autosticky totesmessenger and make brigadier accusations specific towards a user a bannable offense. The sub would then know when SRS or TMOR is trolling and users would be able to utilize reddits functionality more effectively.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Not trying to say that. For real I&#39;d recommend using RES to tag users and block when it becomes apparent they&#39;re not open to engaging in faithful conversation.</p>

<p>FWIW, I have you tagged in RES as &quot;Suspicious&quot; this is the tag I use when I notice a user seems to be resistant to engaging in good faith conversation but I haven&#39;t written them off yet.</p>

<p>Everyone here would benefit from doing more reading and writing with paper.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would agree completely with the bot. I don&#39;t know how the code works on that bit if you can just sticky the totesmessnager and say &quot;ok we know it&#39;s crossposted, we all know what that could mean so grain of salt take it for what you will but don&#39;t get frustrated and start calling people shill brigaders and devolve the sub into an accusation thread. &quot;</p>

<p>Then just remove comments and politely remind people not to go that direction </p>

<p>But I just don&#39;t reddit that hard to use tools and shit. I Just do it on my phone on smoke breaks and down time. </p>

<p>I just lazily want a sub that has rules like rule ten to think about it and either understand new words meaning the same thing as troll or shill like &quot;brigadier&quot; will evolve and you have I say hey that&#39;s pretty much the same nonsense as calling everyone a shill or troll and evolve the rule </p>

<p>Or drop rule ten and let it be a free for all with all that stuff. </p>

<p>I could just get it to catch on to call troll or shills &quot;duders&quot; and skirt the rules. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s fine and part of my point is if someone were to reply to one of my comments by saying &quot;look at your username you are a troll&quot; that post will be removed if I report it. </p>

<p>But if they say &quot;look at your username you are part of a brigade&quot; that&#39;s ok? </p>

<p>The baseless accusations should just stop. They are the definition of forum sliding. </p>

<p>No it does not. Paranoia will destroy ya. Note that most users of this sub are regular weed smokers, and only some of them can admit to themselves that it increases their anxiety and/or paranoia.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I smoke everyday. I never for a second think there are weird inter reddit rivalries and people paid to disagree with me all over the place. </p>

<p>Weed may make you paranoid sometimes if its kind of garbage but nothing explains the depths people will go to rage on the mechanics of the voting on an Internet forum and attribute so much to paid shilling. </p>

<p>I could go on and on about the absolute waste of money shilling to anonymous people on an an anonymous forum would be. Literally the most inefficient way to get results on a narrative I can think of. </p>

<p>The shill dollars are spent on targeted ads using demographic data, audience size means nothing. Smart targeting is multiple bangs for the buck and the only way a professional outfit would operate. </p>

<p>There are literally zero paid human beings in this sub  engaged in active measures. </p>

<p>BS.  I engaged in discussion.  You refuse to.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And I still don&#39;t get how the person who wanted proof trump singled out only specific ethnic groups</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There&#39;s your racism again :(</p>

<p>You came here and made a post because you are upset people called you a shill (or you did it for other reasons, under the guise that you are not taken seriously).</p>

<p>Here&#39;s the thing; Clinton lost.  Hillary Clinton is a failed political candidate.  Lets try the present-progressive.  Hillary Clinton is a failure.  That&#39;s her legacy.  She lost.  She will never win.  As much as it may pain you, Trump will be President of the US for another seven and a half years.  Then, Ivonka will probably become the first female president.</p>

<p>It&#39;s funny you call Trump an trannie, when Clinton is so butch.</p>

<p>Trump whipped her ass too.  Soundly defeated her.  She felt entitled, and she is a failure.  Let be very clear about that.</p>

<p>If you want to avoid being called a shill, or if you want to avoid claims of brigading, will you are going to have to put a little bit more effort into your participation.</p>

<p>To succinctly answer your question, does non-stop complaints about the actual and real brigading of this Internet forum (yeah, it&#39;s a glorified link dump), raises awareness about the actual brigading.  So, yeah, it&#39;s absolutely worth while.</p>

<p>What you will find though, is brigading or shilling-about, will give you a net-negative effect.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s the thing.  You have an overt lack of interest in things that are </p>

<ol>
<li><p>interesting</p></li>
<li><p>on the forum you are visiting and criticizing</p></li>
</ol>

<p>That along is enough to get you called out as a shill.  You are here and you are upset.  You don&#39;t have to be here and you don&#39;t have to be upset.  It&#39;s a choice you made.</p>

<p>I&#39;m here because I want to read deeper into the news.</p>

<p>Why are you here?  To imply that I&#39;m racist?  To insult the duly elected leader of our country?</p>

<p>Do you see the problem?  If not, then you have big problems.</p>

<p>BTW, jamesrandiisatranny!</p>

<p>Have a nice day</p>
