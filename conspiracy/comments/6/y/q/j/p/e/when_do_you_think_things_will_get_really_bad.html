       I know that things are already bad, with mass surveillance and control, but when do you think it will really start to get bad?
      </p>
      <p>
       I know that people interpret what bad is differently, but I'd like to know some interpretations as to when that could happen.
I constantly see online where one person will say "Things are going to get bad soon" then another person says "Oh, it won't get bad for at least 10 more years" and it's getting more and more unpredictable.
      </p>
      <p>
       Things seem to continue to get gradually worse but when do you think it will peak?

       Personally I would have to say the point where people get arrested or blacklisted for saying their political opinion online, cast out of society for conspiracies (people think you're weird if you say you believe conspiracies but you don't get fired for it), anti-government groups get bigger and become a threat, terrorist attacks are the norm but possibly false flags. Robots or AIs take over regular jobs (I'm not much of a 'robots will take over the world' kind of guy but I think it would be a problem if they took over incredibly simple jobs.
      </p>
      <p>
       My problem is that I can't really figure out how close we are to this. I'm not asking for a specific date, just some ideas as to when this could possibly become a norm because it seems like many people have different opinions about this.

       People already get arrested of blacklisted for such things. Michael Hastings, Julian Assange, Glenn Greenwald, Larry King, Russel Brand, Milo Yiannopolous, Martin Shkreli, Doctor Oz.

      <p>
       All the things you are worried about have been the norm for years. By the time it personally impacts you, it will be much too late.

       Sorry no date, but the answer is easy.   Shortly after I'm raptured.   Why, because 
a) a lot of people, but not everyone is going to get raptured,
       <br/>
       b)  most if not all of the liberal confused people will be left and be pushing for removal of Constitutionals  rights,
       <br/>
       c)  most if all of the deep state conservatives will want total control, 
d)  the 'restrainer' will be removed... and lastly the tribulation period will begin.
       <br/>
       I hope you guys packed a lunch.    I'd also recommend a Bible and some knee pads.

       I'm totally in the not subscribed to religion but spiritual. I grew up in a farming community in Missouri, there were roughly 12 churches for a 3000 person population. My parents didn't grow up practicing so we didn't. Well as I grew older I saw how religion created giant rifts in people. Something as small as a Methodist disagreeing with a Baptist because their teachings weren't the same. WTF man? Its all the same shit! Then there was the church political system that was heavily engrained in high school sports. That's why I left home 2 months after graduating to join the service and I never looked back.
      </p>
      <p>
       The perennial philosophy sounds interesting. I'm gonna go more reading on it.

       Yes! I grew up in a very similar town, church on every corner, didn't take long to see that division was bullshit and the people selling it were full of it too...so went to atheism, then had a go at psychedelics on the hunt for their ego death, etc... after a long hunt I came upon the perennial philosophy in a copy of the Gita that had a foreword by aldous huxley and it all started clicking. Once you see it there's no going back, every religion has a thread in it.

       I'm kinda on a personal journey of sorts right now. The last few years have been crazy. Trying to make heads or tails out of life after everything that happened is a son of a bitch. I used to not believe, but I do now. Not sure what exactly but there is something there, just gotta find it.

       Those are the questions that have been asked since the days of the Apostles.   There is more to this than what any specific 'religious' sect would subscribe to.  But to cut to the chase, avoiding all the dogma, Find out what the Gospel of Jesus is, believe on him.   The Holy Spirit is trying to reach everyone...   the shit heads will continue to reject.

       I don't know if you are old enough to have experienced the country going through massive layoffs, but the next round will be really really bad imo.

       My guess, anywhere from 3 to 10 years from now.  Climate change is going to start making lots of the globe uninhabitable.  Not just because of super-storms and rising sea levels, but unprecidented food and water shortages as the ecosystem collapses. This will spark massive migrations of climate refugees, (like, refugees numbering around a billion) all trying to get to safety - this enormous migration and food shortage will cause massive riots, and a brief period of essentially global martial law before the entire shitshow we call "the developed world" eats itself alive and collapses forever.  Several (perhaps as many as five) billion people will die between 2025 and 2035.  The corporate elites who've caused all this (unintentionally or not) have been prepping for collapse for decades.  They have the resources to survive and thrive as the peasantry clamors to be saved.
      </p>
      <p>
       By 2050 it'll be pure Elysium all up in here.

       There
       <em>
        was
       </em>
       the UN's Agenda 2021, now I've discovered the 2030 Agenda.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://truthstreammedia.com/2015/09/25/agenda-2030-b-s-translator-how-to-read-the-uns-new-sustainable-development-goals/">
        http://truthstreammedia.com/2015/09/25/agenda-2030-b-s-translator-how-to-read-the-uns-new-sustainable-development-goals/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Agenda 2030- does the public have any idea what's coming?
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Most members of the public and the news media see the UN as a secular organisation, but UN documents reveal the organisation believes it has a “spiritual” mission to usher in a new world leader who has yet to reveal themselves. That’s one of the reasons the Pope’s involvement with the UN is significant.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       “
       <strong>
        No human force will ever be able to destroy the United Nations
       </strong>
       ,” wrote Assistant UN Secretary General Robert Muller in 1994, “for the United Nations is not a mere building or a mere idea; it is not a man-made creation.”
      </p>
      <p>
       If you think that’s a strange statement for one of the UN’s topmost officials to make, what followed was a doozy:
      </p>
      <p>
       “The United Nations is the vision-light of the Absolute Supreme, which is slowly, steadily and unerringly illuminating the ignorance, the night
of our human life.
      </p>
      <p>
       “The divine success and supreme progress of the United Nations is bound to become a reality. At his choice hour, the Absolute Supreme will ring His own victory-bell here on Earth through the loving and serving heart of the United Nations.”
      </p>

       I think things will get bad if people get hungry. If the food stamps program is suddey defunded we would not be in good shape. We will need community gardens and back yard chickens.

       there's an old saying that; "man is only 4 meals away from rioting/looting"
      </p>
      <p>
       This means that history has shown that 'the people' will begin to loot and steal once their food supplies have run out ,,
       <em>
        pretty soon after
       </em>
       in fact!
      </p>
      <p>
       The MSM isn't covering Venezuela much ... but I believe the looting began there in the last few months and isn't getting better soon the ways things are going ... it's very sad as it was
       <em>
        entirely avoidable
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       IF it wasn't for TPTB who wish to 'own' Venezuela
       <em>
        and it's oil
       </em>
       and so 'sent their Economic Hitmen' down there to 'sort things out'
      </p>
      <p>
       Which it seems they did, as it's
       <em>
        all rapidly
       </em>
       going to shit there after the astonishing 'mis-management' of the countries resources by a dictator who ''gave it all to his mates'' and it's
       <em>
        so fucked
       </em>
       that it's 'ripe for the picking' of an ''Economic Superhero'', something like the World Bank, to come zooming in (on the back of a US B2 bomber?) to 'save they day'! Yippee!
      </p>
      <p>
       The global 'banksters' have been doing this for so long now, (
       <em>
        at least
       </em>
       several hundred years) they have it down to a fine art! (they called it 'plundering and pillaging' on the olden days)
      </p>
      <p>
       My guess is one of the 'Major Powers' i.e. UN/US/NATO et al (they're all 'mates' anyway so it doesn't really matter 'which one' does the work -- odds on it will be (according to the MSM)  a 'multi-national effort'
      </p>
      <p>
       and it will be a
       <em>
        typical/classic
       </em>
       example of how a 'bank' can manipulate the financial system of a country to the point where
       <em>
        the people will welcome
       </em>
       ANY of the aforementioned groups who
       <em>
        promises to
       </em>
       "come in and fix it
       <em>
        and feed them
       </em>
       "!
      </p>
      <p>
       AND desperate, hungry people don't 'think rationally'
      </p>
      <p>
       Once fed,  ''the People'' will be
       <em>
        so grateful
       </em>
       to   this 'new regime'  who has 'saved them from starvation' that they will
       <em>
        be happy to
       </em>
       make the changes their 'saviours' ask of them ... and on the engine of business chugs thanks to the work of their 'economic hitmen' ... like Butler and Perkins to name two.
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        Unaware
       </em>
       that their 'president'
       <em>
        sold
       </em>
       their country by running it the way he has .. into the ground with No way out
       <em>
        except
       </em>
       by some 'benefactor'
      </p>
      <p>
       Across human history, Hunger has driven many a person to kill, many wars have been fought over the most 'fertile lands' where food could be grown (for 'king and country  aka business/cashflow
      </p>
      <p>
       Natural disasters can also bring about similar conditions of desperation -- remember Katrina?
      </p>
      <p>
       How much food and water have you got ... that no one's going to take from you?
      </p>
      <p>
       My heart goes out to the people of the US, talk about being fucked over!

       Personally I would have to say the point where people get arrested or blacklisted for saying their political opinion online, cast out of society for conspiracies (people think you're weird if you say you believe conspiracies but you don't get fired for it), anti-government groups get bigger and become a threat, terrorist attacks are the norm but possibly false flags. Robots or AIs take over regular jobs (I'm not much of a 'robots will take over the world' kind of guy but I think it would be a problem if they took over incredibly simple jobs.
      </p>
      <p>
       My problem is that I can't really figure out how close we are to this. I'm not asking for a specific date, just some ideas as to when this could possibly become a norm because it seems like many people have different opinions about this.
