<p>I know that people interpret what bad is differently, but I&#39;d like to know some interpretations as to when that could happen.
I constantly see online where one person will say &quot;Things are going to get bad soon&quot; then another person says &quot;Oh, it won&#39;t get bad for at least 10 more years&quot; and it&#39;s getting more and more unpredictable.</p>

<p>Things seem to continue to get gradually worse but when do you think it will peak?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Personally I would have to say the point where people get arrested or blacklisted for saying their political opinion online, cast out of society for conspiracies (people think you&#39;re weird if you say you believe conspiracies but you don&#39;t get fired for it), anti-government groups get bigger and become a threat, terrorist attacks are the norm but possibly false flags. Robots or AIs take over regular jobs (I&#39;m not much of a &#39;robots will take over the world&#39; kind of guy but I think it would be a problem if they took over incredibly simple jobs.</p>

<p>My problem is that I can&#39;t really figure out how close we are to this. I&#39;m not asking for a specific date, just some ideas as to when this could possibly become a norm because it seems like many people have different opinions about this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry no date, but the answer is easy.   Shortly after I&#39;m raptured.   Why, because 
a) a lot of people, but not everyone is going to get raptured,<br/>
b)  most if not all of the liberal confused people will be left and be pushing for removal of Constitutionals  rights,<br/>
c)  most if all of the deep state conservatives will want total control, 
d)  the &#39;restrainer&#39; will be removed... and lastly the tribulation period will begin.<br/>
 I hope you guys packed a lunch.    I&#39;d also recommend a Bible and some knee pads.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m totally in the not subscribed to religion but spiritual. I grew up in a farming community in Missouri, there were roughly 12 churches for a 3000 person population. My parents didn&#39;t grow up practicing so we didn&#39;t. Well as I grew older I saw how religion created giant rifts in people. Something as small as a Methodist disagreeing with a Baptist because their teachings weren&#39;t the same. WTF man? Its all the same shit! Then there was the church political system that was heavily engrained in high school sports. That&#39;s why I left home 2 months after graduating to join the service and I never looked back. </p>

<p>The perennial philosophy sounds interesting. I&#39;m gonna go more reading on it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes! I grew up in a very similar town, church on every corner, didn&#39;t take long to see that division was bullshit and the people selling it were full of it too...so went to atheism, then had a go at psychedelics on the hunt for their ego death, etc... after a long hunt I came upon the perennial philosophy in a copy of the Gita that had a foreword by aldous huxley and it all started clicking. Once you see it there&#39;s no going back, every religion has a thread in it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My guess, anywhere from 3 to 10 years from now.  Climate change is going to start making lots of the globe uninhabitable.  Not just because of super-storms and rising sea levels, but unprecidented food and water shortages as the ecosystem collapses. This will spark massive migrations of climate refugees, (like, refugees numbering around a billion) all trying to get to safety - this enormous migration and food shortage will cause massive riots, and a brief period of essentially global martial law before the entire shitshow we call &quot;the developed world&quot; eats itself alive and collapses forever.  Several (perhaps as many as five) billion people will die between 2025 and 2035.  The corporate elites who&#39;ve caused all this (unintentionally or not) have been prepping for collapse for decades.  They have the resources to survive and thrive as the peasantry clamors to be saved.</p>

<p>By 2050 it&#39;ll be pure Elysium all up in here.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There <em>was</em> the UN&#39;s Agenda 2021, now I&#39;ve discovered the 2030 Agenda.</p>

<p><a href="http://truthstreammedia.com/2015/09/25/agenda-2030-b-s-translator-how-to-read-the-uns-new-sustainable-development-goals/">http://truthstreammedia.com/2015/09/25/agenda-2030-b-s-translator-how-to-read-the-uns-new-sustainable-development-goals/</a></p>

<p>Agenda 2030- does the public have any idea what&#39;s coming?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Most members of the public and the news media see the UN as a secular organisation, but UN documents reveal the organisation believes it has a “spiritual” mission to usher in a new world leader who has yet to reveal themselves. That’s one of the reasons the Pope’s involvement with the UN is significant.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>“<strong>No human force will ever be able to destroy the United Nations</strong>,” wrote Assistant UN Secretary General Robert Muller in 1994, “for the United Nations is not a mere building or a mere idea; it is not a man-made creation.”</p>

<p>If you think that’s a strange statement for one of the UN’s topmost officials to make, what followed was a doozy:</p>

<p>“The United Nations is the vision-light of the Absolute Supreme, which is slowly, steadily and unerringly illuminating the ignorance, the night
of our human life.</p>

<p>“The divine success and supreme progress of the United Nations is bound to become a reality. At his choice hour, the Absolute Supreme will ring His own victory-bell here on Earth through the loving and serving heart of the United Nations.”</p>

    <div class="md"><p>there&#39;s an old saying that; &quot;man is only 4 meals away from rioting/looting&quot;</p>

<p>This means that history has shown that &#39;the people&#39; will begin to loot and steal once their food supplies have run out ,, <em>pretty soon after</em> in fact!</p>

<p>The MSM isn&#39;t covering Venezuela much ... but I believe the looting began there in the last few months and isn&#39;t getting better soon the ways things are going ... it&#39;s very sad as it was <em>entirely avoidable</em> </p>

<p>IF it wasn&#39;t for TPTB who wish to &#39;own&#39; Venezuela <em>and it&#39;s oil</em> and so &#39;sent their Economic Hitmen&#39; down there to &#39;sort things out&#39;</p>

<p>Which it seems they did, as it&#39;s <em>all rapidly</em> going to shit there after the astonishing &#39;mis-management&#39; of the countries resources by a dictator who &#39;&#39;gave it all to his mates&#39;&#39; and it&#39;s <em>so fucked</em> that it&#39;s &#39;ripe for the picking&#39; of an &#39;&#39;Economic Superhero&#39;&#39;, something like the World Bank, to come zooming in (on the back of a US B2 bomber?) to &#39;save they day&#39;! Yippee!</p>

<p>The global &#39;banksters&#39; have been doing this for so long now, (<em>at least</em> several hundred years) they have it down to a fine art! (they called it &#39;plundering and pillaging&#39; on the olden days)</p>

<p>My guess is one of the &#39;Major Powers&#39; i.e. UN/US/NATO et al (they&#39;re all &#39;mates&#39; anyway so it doesn&#39;t really matter &#39;which one&#39; does the work -- odds on it will be (according to the MSM)  a &#39;multi-national effort&#39; </p>

<p>and it will be a <em>typical/classic</em> example of how a &#39;bank&#39; can manipulate the financial system of a country to the point where <em>the people will welcome</em> ANY of the aforementioned groups who <em>promises to</em> &quot;come in and fix it <em>and feed them</em>&quot;!</p>

<p>AND desperate, hungry people don&#39;t &#39;think rationally&#39;</p>

<p>Once fed,  &#39;&#39;the People&#39;&#39; will be <em>so grateful</em> to   this &#39;new regime&#39;  who has &#39;saved them from starvation&#39; that they will <em>be happy to</em> make the changes their &#39;saviours&#39; ask of them ... and on the engine of business chugs thanks to the work of their &#39;economic hitmen&#39; ... like Butler and Perkins to name two.</p>

<p><em>Unaware</em> that their &#39;president&#39; <em>sold</em> their country by running it the way he has .. into the ground with No way out <em>except</em> by some &#39;benefactor&#39;</p>

<p>Across human history, Hunger has driven many a person to kill, many wars have been fought over the most &#39;fertile lands&#39; where food could be grown (for &#39;king and country  aka business/cashflow</p>

<p>Natural disasters can also bring about similar conditions of desperation -- remember Katrina?   </p>

<p>How much food and water have you got ... that no one&#39;s going to take from you?</p>

<p>My heart goes out to the people of the US, talk about being fucked over! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Personally I would have to say the point where people get arrested or blacklisted for saying their political opinion online, cast out of society for conspiracies (people think you&#39;re weird if you say you believe conspiracies but you don&#39;t get fired for it), anti-government groups get bigger and become a threat, terrorist attacks are the norm but possibly false flags. Robots or AIs take over regular jobs (I&#39;m not much of a &#39;robots will take over the world&#39; kind of guy but I think it would be a problem if they took over incredibly simple jobs.</p>

<p>My problem is that I can&#39;t really figure out how close we are to this. I&#39;m not asking for a specific date, just some ideas as to when this could possibly become a norm because it seems like many people have different opinions about this.</p>
