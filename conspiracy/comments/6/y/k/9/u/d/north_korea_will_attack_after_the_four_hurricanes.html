    <div class="md"><p>Surely they would have a better impact if they hit the US after the hurricanes than before? Regardless of where the returning firepower is coming from. If Nk&#39;s plan is successful then it will be more damaging to a country thats had 4 hurricanes and FEMA is &quot;broke&quot; and cannot help the civilians than a country dealing with no &quot;natural&quot; disasters?  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well I guess he was wrong eh... Launched another missle this morning the crazy bastard but he&#39;s not crazy enuff to attack the U.S. by himself he knows that the U.S. Military and NATO would wipe him off the map... I know that Canada (my country) and the UK an Israeli military is just gonna watch north Korea attack the US mainland... No way North Korea is doing this because they want a say in world politics and to build economy an so on  which sucks.. but at the same time we keep putting sanctions an shit like that on them we are gonna make them more and more desperate and God knows what he&#39;s gonna do when his back is pushed to the corner it does scare the shit out of me that he&#39;s a mad man and God knows that he&#39;s gonna do but I don&#39;t believe he wants to die.. least not yet anyway...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The hurricanes might be devastating but america is a huge country. The storms won&#39;t affect a single nuclear sub or aircraft carrier, not to mention several thousand missile silos.</p>

<p>The best NK could ever do is wipe out LA. Some Americans might even thank kim for doing so. But do you really think Kim is insane enough to do it?</p>

<p>He would only do it in retaliation as a final &quot;F YOU&quot;. US would have to strike first. This goes back to a problem the US has had since world war 2: no country is stupid enough to directly attack the US! The Japs did at Pearl Harbor, after being tricked into doing so. That was the last time.</p>

<p>America would be better served trying to determine if any of Israel&#39;s nukes are aimed at New York or DC. Ever heard of the Samson option? If Israel goes they are taking us with them!</p>
