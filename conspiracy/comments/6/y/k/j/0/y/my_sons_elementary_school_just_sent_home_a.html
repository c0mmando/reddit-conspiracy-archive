<p>A company only caring about making a profit is FAR more of a problem than whatever motives would derive from the characterization of Google that you guys put forward.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you think Google is the only &quot;Bogey Man&quot; out there, you&#39;re wrong.  Your mail is cataloged every day, <a href="https://informeddelivery.usps.com/box/pages/intro/start.action">and you can even get copies of what is coming in your mail sent to your email server</a>(private or not).  Besides USPS, FedEx, DHL and UPS, who else is really delivering packages that guarantee anonymity and doesn&#39;t store addresses of packages that go through their system?</p>

<p>Your shopping habits down to the grocery store are analyzed and targeted for advertisements directed at you(catalina coupons), so unless you only shop with cash and don&#39;t use a loyalty or discount card or shop at a bodega, <em>they</em> know what you are buying, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/kashmirhill/2012/02/16/how-target-figured-out-a-teen-girl-was-pregnant-before-her-father-did/#1d5ae19d6668">and might even know if you are pregnant before YOU do.</a> </p>

<p>The list goes on and on. </p>

<p>So what will Google or the Beast learn from scanning school assignments?  What you did over summer vacation?  They likely already know because of all your social media posts that are geo-tagged and have faces tagged by the child themselves during the vacation.  Maybe they&#39;ll pick up some illegal activity your child mentions.  Except that teachers are required by law to disclose any crimes they discover through children.   Maybe the computers will find out what love is by reading a first grader&#39;s paper about why his dad is his hero.</p>

<p>It actually would probably not be a source of any valuable data because it is most likely compromised by being partially written/aided by another person or more.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>For the sum history of our 150 year old education system minus maybe a few years, we did not require sacrificing our children&#39;s privacy rights to companies who profit off such information, build advanced psychological profiles of the same, and furthermore are subject to laws of a foreign country of the nature of the Patriot Act, which is barely 15 years old itself.</p>

<p>It depends on how you define &quot;odious&quot;, but there is a real push by Google, and Facebook, and others - to make people everywhere dependant on their services so they can have free reign over data collection and further pushing their advertising goals. Up until recently that didn&#39;t really effect our education system and we could make a choice as parents how much we wanted to educate our children on the trade offs of privacy in the modern world.</p>

<p>Even these last few strands are being attacked, and your response is that we shouldn&#39;t worry because this is simply the world we live in now?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>While in an ideal world children wouldn&#39;t be targets of information gathering or even advertising this is not the world we live in.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We should are least be pretending to strive for an ideal world, and at the very least that means raising awareness of information gathering activities targeting our children for the purposes of advertising and being exposed to sweeping anti-privacy laws such as the Patriot Act.</p>

<p>The fact that the world we live in is currently subject to these kinds of activities does not preclude us making a fuss and potentially changing that.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Rather a defeatist outlook. The best we can do is education our children on the trade offs, the concerns, and let them make their own decisions. The fact that government subsidised services paid for by tax payers is engaging in these information gathering activities for private foreign companies might be a problem for people, it might not. But I see no harm in there being a conversation about it, and certainly if the consensus is that this particular case is a problem, perhaps we as a society can collectively force protections against it.</p>

<p>Raising children to have these conversations and be aware of such things is certainly part and parcel of raising a population adept at critical thinking and I would rather argue they would be the opposite of social outcasts, and rather on the front lines of social reforms and striving towards building that better &quot;ideal&quot; world we all hope for.</p>

<p>Are you saying you think if you save a copy of a GoogleDocs file on your hard drive that it can&#39;t be open offline or after your account is closed?  I just went to GoogleDocs and a file I created on there gave me no fewer than SEVEN different formats(MS Word, OpenDocument, PDF, rich text, plain text, EPUB, and HTML) to save/download it as onto my computers hard drive, flash drive, or floppy drive(if I had one).

<p>Even if you have an offline copy, of all your files in a GoogleDrive-folder no longer connected with the servers, well. Then you still can&#39;t open the files, because they require a login to open.</p>

<p>No.  You save them on a hard drive or flash drive or a CDR or a floppy.  No login required.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>but it&#39;s so annoying for the <strong>stupid students</strong> that wanna transfer essays from a school that have the whole Google-package to a school that have the whole Office365-package</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If they are &quot;stupid&quot; as you say, then any steps will be &quot;annoying&quot;.  But as I said above, you can save as MS Word format in Google Docs.  But be warned, many schools consider submitting past works of your own as &quot;new work&quot;, plagiarism.  Happened to me. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think you understand what&#39;s going on in that video, I can probably help you navigate some of the issues if you want to dm me. </p>

<p>The reason it asks for your username and password is just so it can automate the login process so you can skip the clicks of downloading the documents and do it automatically. Whenever you have a new document on the cloud or a document that has been edited, it will download it and place it in that folder on your computer. After files are downloaded from google they&#39;re on your computer, this just saves you a few clicks. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;m just sort of against the fact that public schools make little kids into customers of big data before they even have a choice.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you&#39;re against big data, get off of reddit, which is literally one of the biggest centers of data there is. I mean, big data is really a term used to describe sites that are so big, and have so much information coming in, and so many associations within that data. </p>

<p>10 years from now &quot;knowing how to share documents over the cloud&quot; will sound like as outdated of a skill as &quot;I can type fast&quot;- nobody cares anymore, everyone&#39;s supposed to be able to that.</p>

<p>You, as a parent can download documents for them, check their progress, see if they did their homework (by checking the &quot;last edited on&quot; column). I feel like learning how to use shared documents is as important of a skill to teach as cursive and shooting bison in Oregon Trail on a shitty mac desktop was when I was in school</p>

<p>But seriously, I think a lot of what you&#39;re concerned about in terms of losing documents and making sure you can see it frever is addressed by googleApps. If you dm me I&#39;ll give you my skypeID and you can call me if you&#39;re having issues. </p>

But its okay.  </p>

<p>No, I&#39;m just against big data that are forced on children. And I&#39;m well aware of how Reddit is used like that (I am very frequently in here lurking around, and I have read some of those posts)  </p>

<p>I know how to do these things. But since my explanation is a bit screwed up (english obviously isn&#39;t my first language), I think some of what I am trying to say, gets lost in translation or something :)<br/>
But it&#39;s fine - it is a minor issue as I said before, and I&#39;m not going to lose any more sleep by ranting about this on Reddit.</p>

<p>This school district is trying to improve access to learning material and documentation in an easy and consistent way. There is nothing wrong with that.</p>

<p>Also Google Apps has functionality that lets you export all of the digital content; so that should not be a concern. Pragmatically, this is probably a good platform for education and the school is being responsible and letting you know. Ultimately the choice is yours, but there is nothing sinister about this.</p>

The personal information that will be stored on Google&#39;s servers is referring to the class assignments and materials. These apps allow teachers to communicate more readily with parents and students, and allow the school to move away from paper-based materials. These apps allow students to more readily collaborate if they can&#39;t easily meet up after school, or even allow them to work together on projects or assignments in class, and can help the teacher to give the students an at-a-glance view of missing work.</p>

<p>There is no more invasion of privacy at work here than using email, and significantly less than using facebook, instagram, or snapchat.

    <div class="md"><p>Google Apps is definitely a thing, I used to have a personal account and I loved it, it was great software. I was always amazed that it was available for free for personal use (they did charge for Business Accounts). Then I saw them branch off and heavily promote Googe Apps for Education. I couldn&#39;t believe the cool shit they were arming teachers with, making their lives (for the most part) so much easier with online grade books and scheduling apps and attendance sheets and survey forms to communicate w parents and integrating w smartboards/encouraging the every kid w an ipad initiative etc. Now the overwhelming amount of new technology seems pretty out of hand, but the teachers/principles are just giddy to have these new tools that (sort of) simplify their chaotic lives. Once these programs become standard in the classroom, it will be practically impossible to remove them. We know that technology is changing the way kids brains work (its addictive, have you noticed?) But I don&#39;t feel like we have a very good gameplan for how we&#39;re going to teach and raise these kids so they become healthy, balanced, productive members of society. I realize that some folks will argue that this is exactly what TPTB want-- to raise unhealthy, unstable, highly impressionable children that they can easily control. I am undecided on that. But this form sure does make you ponder why Google has such a keen interest in our kids&#39; academic archive, no? What could they possible want with years worth of test scores, creative writing assignments, daily journals, math tests, social studies homework, behavioral record/disciplinary reports, free lunch schedule, immunization records/medical history/allergies/dietary restrictions/approved medications list, etc.? (ends sarcasm)</p>

<p>This is a shitty dilemma for parents to deal with right now, but I think this is about to become an extremely common issue for those w school aged kids. Google Apps for Education is already pretty commonly used in certain school districts, although I have never seen a parental consent form for using it. Good on your school for asking for permission, I guess? I dunno, I honestly think you are going to have to sign it if you want your kid to go to school there. I don&#39;t think schools have the resources to accommodate the few students whose parents don&#39;t want to be part of the &quot;super convenient, totally harmless&quot; system that everyone else is on board with.

    <div class="md"><p>BC law prohibits public institutions from outsourcing personal information to U.S. located servers without explicit consent. In addition, the school board&#39;s relationship with Google/GAFE would be governed by a separate contract/ToS that is different, more comprehensive and more restrictive than the one you and I agree to when using the free online services (e.g. no profiling or advertising). Finally, it seems likely that schools/school boards would provide students with access to these GAFE services via school-issued computing devices, using school-issued email accounts to log in. The intent of all these measures is to restrict the ability of Google to collect, use and disclose students&#39; personal information for purposes unrelated to the school&#39;s mandate. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mean, would you rather they didn&#39;t inform you and get your consent? People seem to be bashing the school here, but they are being transparent about what the students will be using and making you an informed parent. And &quot;personal info&quot; here is his name, grade level and school. If the government or any other entity wanted to figure that out, I am pretty sure they would not need Google Apps to find that info. The school would probably hand off info to law enforcement or the government long before they tried to get it from Google. By the way, any communication you make over the internet that passes into or out of the US is subject to the Patriot Act and surveillance, so unless you use no American internet services, you have already consented to this by using those services. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would just make sure your child uses it exclusively for school activity and tries not to enter any type of extra identifying information in that account. Google Apps is quite common in the corporate business and education so there is plenty of much more useful information that could be used nefariously, then a young childs school habits. </p>

<p>Also, in 5 to 10 or 20 years from now, theres likely zero chance your child is still using this school account, so theres not too much worry there in terms of how the stored information could be used, unless of course you are concerned with how itll shape curriculum for future generations. </p>

<p>I just feel like there is enough other spying and surveillance going on that this sub harping on a school being transparent about what using Google Apps means for their privacy concerns is silly to me. If anything we should be applauding the school for being transparent about it because I bet many other schools and institutions blanket cover your consent by being enrolled at that institution. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>in response to your edit, I guess my question would be more about why you fear google so badly. I know this sub will certainly make one feel that way, but do you have any specific reasons to not trust google at all as a cloud service? Realistically by that logic you need to stop using an Apple/HP/Dell/etc computer, make sure to stop using Windows or OSX and I presume you have a smart phone as well, chuck that. This sub thinks Google is absolute evil and that somehow Google = Government, but thus far I have not seen any specific reasons to believe any of that or seen them use any information maliciously. </p>

<p>The two biggest manufacturers of Office software are Microsoft, with Office 360, and Google, with Google Docs.  Having office software is more or less mandatory in schools, unless you want your kids to be typing up essays on Notepad.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, this would expose that data to the Americans.  But the reality is that virtually everything that is done on the internet is already exposed to the Americans, and it&#39;s not as if your child is going to be typing up incriminating things for their school projects.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I cross-posted this to <a href="/r/canada">/r/canada</a> and there is a bit of info there that might interest you, especially <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/canada/comments/6yn44w/my_sons_elementary_school_just_sent_home_a/dmpit04/?context=3">this one</a>. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>you&#39;re in BC and i work in privacy, also in BC.</p>

<p>this form and what the school district is trying to do is perfectly compliant with our privacy legislation (FOIPPA, which they cite).</p>

<p>you are right to be concerned about what the US can do with Canadian&#39;s personal information that is stored in the States, but as far as whether or not your school district, Abbotsford, can legally do this - yes, they can. provided they have your consent, which they are seeking with this form. (they are missing the contact information of an employee who can answer any questions about the form, however, so not perfectly compliant actually...).</p>

<p>what might be worth asking is how long does Abbotsford plan to retain your son/daughter&#39;s information. ask them how long their retention schedule is, and when your child&#39;s information is scheduled to be destroyed. this might be something they haven&#39;t thought about. unfortunately the obligation to destroy a person&#39;s personal information is not strictly outlined in FOIPPA.</p>

<p>what you could also ask is whether Abbotsford has performed a privacy impact assessment (PIA). per s.69(5.3):</p>

<p>(5.3) The head of a public body that is not a ministry must conduct a privacy impact assessment in accordance with the directions of the minister responsible for this Act.</p>

<p>you might also want to see if there&#39;s a contract in place b/t Abbotsford and google (imo, unlikely). If not... then google does not have a strong contractual obligation to protect your kid&#39;s info besides their own desire to do so. privacy with respect to companies like these is usually about trust. example of a privacy schedule in a contract: <a href="http://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/DownloadAsset?assetId=1E0FE6E8266548C1B07FD31B8F1D0A1C&amp;amp;filename=privacy_protection_schedule.doc">http://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/DownloadAsset?assetId=1E0FE6E8266548C1B07FD31B8F1D0A1C&amp;amp;filename=privacy_protection_schedule.doc</a></p>

<p>to provide some reassurance though, you or people you know probably have gmail accounts already. google and companies like google have a lot of personal information already which people have freely provided to them. the value in that data is generally in aggregate, not in isolation (&#39;big data&#39;). usually in privacy, it&#39;s not about avoiding risk - it&#39;s about mitigating risk. and i think the risk posed to these kids is, frankly, not very high. does your kid have facebook? he/she probably will soon, if not already. that&#39;s a higher risk on its own than what Abbotsford is trying to do here.</p>
