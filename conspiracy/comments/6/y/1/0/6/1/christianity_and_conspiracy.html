       There is a definite anti Christian sentiment in this sub, and while I can see why there would be something of that nature heavily permeating standard society, I'm a little surprised to find such a knee jerk reaction from theorists here.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most of you here have done enough research to know that the ancient mystery religions and their outward expressions such as the Freemasons, Illuminati, etc all exist and control places of high office and unappointed major non-governmental power.  They are the movers and shakers of the world we live in. Centralizing power, clearing the path for top-down world domination.  Most of you can agree to that right?
      </p>
      <p>
       But very few seem to really ask
       <em>
        why
       </em>
       ? What's the point of all this, the ever quicker centralizing of power across every industry. The slower yet unrelenting twisting of Christ's actual teachings into something they are not, while using the Catholic Church, Scientologyand other offshoot "Christianlike" religions such as Christ Church of science, Mormons, Jehovah's witnesses, most of which were founded by, you guessed it, Freemasons.
      </p>
      <p>
       For the answer to
       <em>
        why
       </em>
       all this deception, corruption, centralization, the constant attack on our psyche via false left/right black/white rich/poor paradigm's that are pushed on us across every media outlet, and even larger of importance the recent permeation of the ancient mystery beliefs that have been quickly pushed into our thoughts as a "new" way to look at the Bible,
       <strong>
        all you have to do is read the "mystery" groups own teachings on how to push their agenda.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       These people believe
       <strong>
        FULLY
       </strong>
       in higher powers. It is Luciferian ideology
       <strong>
        to its core.
       </strong>
       They believe Lucifer to be a "God." Which of this plane he
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       in control.  And Jesus, while also a God, is the bad guy, Adonai.
      </p>
      <p>
       All their work is to bring the world to a place where 1 "person", their god, can take control of everything. All the centralizing, the Amazon's, Google's, Facebook's, UN, all of it is to prepare for this.
       <strong>
        And it's working.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       13 But woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye shut up the kingdom of heaven against men: for ye neither go in yourselves, neither suffer ye them that are entering to go in.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyone ready to look at their plan and how it's been carried out over the last century can download a copy of 
"Externalisation of the Hierarchy" by Alice Bailey for free online. It outlines how they would inflitrate, device, and influence religion, Freemasonry, government, and centralize all these powers for the return of their own Christ. Lucifer. The Antichrist spoken of in Revelation. It all lines up with the teachings of Jesus about the end of this world, and is a absolute match for the "Mystery Babylon" harlot and beasts spoken of by John of Patmos in Revelation.
      </p>

       I know many of the commenters here will berate me, downvote into oblivion, call me names etc and I don't care. A lot of that will come from the puppets and their organizers that have taken over the content of this sub.  But maybe someone will see it so that's all ok with me.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've had this account for awhile now, used to post here quite a bit under other psuedonyms years ago before the sub hit 100k subscribers and was thereafter flooded by the agencies. Haven't posted since then because I saw it as dangerous. Names on a list and all that, but I don't care anymore:
      </p>
      <p>
       "Lucifer comes to give us the final … Luciferic initiation … that many people now and in the days ahead, will be facing—for it is an initiation into the New Age. … No one will enter the New World Order unless he or she will make a pledge to worship Lucifer. No one will enter the New Age unless he will take a Luciferian initiation."

       Nice. Liked your thoughts. Ive cme to a similar conclusion albeit more sinistrr and simple. They want us to deny spirituality from the bible because jesus gives us steps to follow.
      </p>
      <p>
       Globe earth. Media. Social engineering. All designed for us to do everything the bible says is wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       You should follow the advice of the great like jesus and search for G-d within you. The temple of G-d is within you.

       Riffing off that point it makes sense.

      <p>
       I agree with you both that satan is the ruler of this world and man is a fallen creature so it would follow the world at large is pretty messed up.

       Should the elite occult actually be aligning themselves with lucifer, directly or indirectly would explain their personal wealth as well as their agenda.

       It's directly, most of those in these groups have been decieved, and it's admitted by the higher ups.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lucifer is the great deciever, and can even appear as an "angel of light". He offered Jesus in the desert all the kingdoms of this world. And has been given the power to deliver. Jesus as the Son of God  denied it. How many men these days could/would deny such a thing?

       Yeah that reaction can be a pain.

       I think its in the culture of conspiracy to see longstanding organizations like the Catholic church and think "there's gotta be something going on"
      </p>
      <p>
       Also are you trying to say its the Catholic church contorting the teaching of Christ? Cause that was almost certainly Protestantism like you mention. If anyone has a proper teaching on Christ its Cathorthodoxy

       I mean Christ literally say thou art rock(petras) and on this rock I will build my church.

       It was infiltrated ages ago. Jesus is the only "father", and hearer of repentance. Some pedophiliac priest can't grant you forgiveness for your sins with a few chants. Also Catholicism promotes use of graven images, beads, the prayer to saints, it's a modern day demagaugy.

       Infiltrated by who? and can you be more specific than ages, its been a couple thousand years. When exactly did it lose its course.
      </p>
      <p>
       Please don't take a couple bad apples and think the whole bunch is bad. Unfortunately pedo's will take any position as long as it means children. The theology, philosophy and history are still strong.
      </p>
      <p>
       Are you aware the catholic church pretty much set every guideline you as a Christian follow? Minds like Augustine, Thomas Aquinas and Hildegard were all Catholic thinkers though Protestantism likes to claim them.
      </p>
      <p>
       The church is a community throughout time and so we ask saints to pray to the lord for us. Its perfectly licit; like when you ask a friend to submit your application to the boss for you since he already works there. There is nothing wrong with prayer beads and we do not worship any images. With that logic what ISN'T a graven image?

       Now i personally don't subscribe to sola scriptura but if the church was hijacked wouldn't that mean that Christ was wrong when he said "and the gates of hell will not triumph over it"
      </p>
      <p>
       So who's lying? If THE church was corrupted what's the real one now? Cause there's been a few thousand splits. Is god currently with the American Church of the Light of Christ? Or maybe the Episcopalian charismatic movement? These are made up churches but you get my point.

       You've decided, or had it decided for you,  that the Catholic Church has been assigned Jesus's church. Jesus has a few very simple rules to follow. No named church is Jesus' church. He isn't the champion of one brand of christianity over another. Christ's church isn't a brick and mortar building with a symbol on the wall. It is the group of people, regardless of the named organized religion we call it they "belong to", that follow HIS teachings. His church is made up of every race color and creed, so long as they follow his teachings. Which are quite simple.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Don't lie, and don't do what you hate, because all things are disclosed before heaven. After all, there is nothing hidden that will not be revealed, and there is nothing covered up that will remain undisclosed."
      </p>
      <p>
       “love the Lord your God” (Matt. 22:37) and “love your neighbor as yourself” (v.39)
      </p>
      <p>
       That's it. No stand up sit down. No confessionals to corrupted institutions. No hail Marys. No observation of some archaic diet. No earthly institution.
      </p>
      <p>
       Christ's church isn't physical, it's spiritual.

       That's some heresy or another.
      </p>
      <p>
       I just find it ironic that when you quote the bible as you do you are to some extent trusting the (original) church that compiled and translated the bible.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyone could read the bible and get any number of interpretations. Without an authority to teach it it loses all meaning. I mean shit the church exercised that authority when they chose what to put in the bible.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why did God come to Earth if the church is only spiritual? Why in the old testament did the jews build the temple and Why did Christ cleanse the temple if there is no meaning in brick and mortar?

       Have you ever read John 6?

       If you notice, not all of those quotes were from the Bible. The gospel of Thomas was left out of cannon, however can be traced back to Jesus time like Matthew Mark Luke and John. I trust those books in the KJV Bible because the newer versions like to change words. Removing some and changing others, like the change from "cornerstone" to "capstone". The cornerstone is the 1st block laid and the capstone, the last. And while yes, I'm sure some of Jesus'sayings were left out of, or slightly changed in the cannonical scripture, when you cross reference them with Thomas, which wasn't rediscovered and translated until 1945, it fits. Now there were a plethora of other gnostic teachings discovered along with that text, but they don't closely match the scriptures.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe you don't realize it, or maybe you do and that's the point, but you've immediately gone on the offensive, attacking me without bothering to read the information I've provided, called me a heretic, and are even using arguments to attack what I've said here that are used to  turn people away from any Christian religion. All of these tactics are spelled out in the very book you refuse to read.
      </p>
      <p>
       Either way this conversation isn't going anywhere. Good day.

       Well it sounded like you were denying the Trinity which is literally heresy. The KJV isn't really the best source because its missing 3 books of the original canon and isn't even that good an a translation to boot. If you want accuracy but can't read do Latin try the Douay Rheims. One of the closest translations as its based on the vulgate directly to English.
      </p>
      <p>
       You told me to read a whole boom so i can understand your viewpoints but the initial points you made were arguments the church has been dealing with for over hundreds of years.

       We are of one body as we are all baptised in Christ. And later in that Paul lays down a type of hierarchy similar to the church (not all are apostles etc)
      </p>
      <p>
       But we are also one body in Christ as a church as we are all on communion with Christ. How are we in communion with him? Because we eat of the bread of heaven. We eat Christ and so are in communion with him.
      </p>
      <p>
       That is why he puts such stress on 'this is my body' and also why it mentions that many discisples left because of that hard teaching- its literal. He goes on to say 'do this in memory of me' which is why the apostles were gathered on Pentecost iirc-they were breaking the bread. Thats Christ gave Peter than authority to the church- so it would Have order and so we can continue his work-all subsisting on the same bread from heaven: Christ himself .

       My beef is with organized religion. And the premise of christianity that there is only one path to salvation bothers me as a very typical manmade control trope.
      </p>
      <p>
       That said, I agree with most of what you say here. And as always, what I believe doesn't matter. What the bad guys believe does. They are going to think and act in such a way to create the best possible environment for their beliefs to flourish. And they are demonstrably evil believing motherfuckers.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, I don't have a problem with Christians. I don't agree with them on the nature of reality, but I don't need to. Our goals have enough in common to almost entirely ally myself with them. And where are beliefs are different, it literally doesn't matter on our little spinning rock here in any practical way.
      </p>
      <p>
       So carry on there jesus people! I understand you are on the good guys team.

       If you haven't already, you should check out the four
       <strong>
        Canonical Gospels
       </strong>
       : Matthew, Mark, Luke and John.  They cover the life, teaching, death and resurrection of Jesus the Nazarene.  After I believe you will have a much better grasp of why Christ Jesus is the Lord and Savior of the world.

       I often find that this claim is made by people who have browsed lots of information
       <em>
        about
       </em>
       the Bible, usually involving very skewed interpretations of specific quotes and passages.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then again, I know some non-Christians for whom this statement is reasonably true (though in that case, it really does mean that they need a better educated class of Christian friend, since there are plenty of Christians who have spent years studying their holy text in divinity schools).
      </p>

       You could be either, but on reddit my assumptions tend toward the pessimistic, and that has rarely served me poorly.

       That's a rare quality. Aristotle once said that it was the mark of an educated mind to be able to be able to entertain a thought without accepting it. You appear to have such a mind.

       It requires context. When you realize that "charity" in 1 Corinthians isn't giving money to the poor, but a universal love, thanks whole book, and especially chapter 13 becomes stunningly beautiful. The idea that the founder of a religion would say that it's all meaningless if you can't feel a love for all mankind. That kind of shocks me. I can only think of one other who focused so heavily on how you perceive others when founding a religion: Siddhārtha Gautama, AKA The Buddha.

       It's more than that to me. Words are changed, important words that define ideas, in other versions. Also words are removed.
      </p>
      <p>
       The changing of cornerstone to capstone is just one instance, although in the latest edition it has been changed back, it calls in to question the entire translation.

       ?! What the heck are you talking about? I said nothing about Rosicrucians or editing of the Bible. The only editing that I'm aware of James being accused of was in ensuring that a passage referring to poisoning became a condemnation of witches.

       I guess you didn't read it, again. In your own Masonic site, in the footnotes after the ridiculous claim, it says that
       <strong>
        there is no evidence for the statement

       Freemasonry is most definitely a religion.
You must believe in a higher power to be a member.
You must follow their tenants for living and how you act.
That's religion my friend.

       No, it says there's no primary source. There certainly is rather solid secondary source evidence, and this correlates well with what little we know of Freemasonry and James at that time. There are very few men for whom we have any primary source evidence of their membership prior to the founding of the Grand Lodge of England in 1717. But we do know of many men who were almost certainly members, and James is on that list.

       You didn't make a vague claim about similarities or even connections. You specifically brought up a claim about James handing the Bible off for editing to Rosicrucians. I never made this claim. Don't put words in my mouth.

       Yes you must. But why do you think that a religious
       <em>
        requirement

       makes a group a religion? I know groups from go-cart racing teams to philosophical discussion groups that require members to be some specific religion. Surely you're not claiming that they're religions too?

       Nope. The moral lessons of Freemasonry are entirely advisory. No one tells me how I should apply those lessons in my life, any more than a college forces you to apply their lessons in a specific way. Freemasonry is the college of moral philosophy. It's as simple (and complex) as that.

      <p>
       Religion involves a proscribed, usually dogmatic belief. Freemasonry has no such thing. It has a bar that you must meet to join: you have to believe in some sort of a supreme being. That's the end of it. No one will tell you how or what to believe, how to worship or what traditions to observe in the course of that worship. That's all between you and your church... your
       <em>
        religion
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       There are Freemasons who are Christian, Muslim, Jewish, deist, pantheist, Hindu, Buddhist, and numerous other smaller religions. If Freemasonry were a religion, this would not be possible.

       Oh my... that's ... I need to go wash out my eyes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Are you seriously expecting me to rebut that rolling screed?! Pick a topic, at least... there's dozens of claims there. Most are just, "we interpret Freemasonry this way, and that's naughty," sorts of subjective claims that can't be refuted.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just as an example the claim about Freemasonry having form of "salvation" hinges on interpreting several quotations about desiring a positive afterlife as promoting a specific form of salvation. If you were inclined to interpret them that way, good for you, but that doesn't mean that the next Brother does, and the proof isn't in what you can interpret the degrees as meaning; the proof is in demonstrating that someone will tell you that you're wrong to interpret the degrees however you like. If they do, then that's not philosophy, it's a religion. Thankfully, Freemasonry is about philosophy and is not a religion, so no one will tell you any such thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, I love this proviso:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        We do not recommend discussing the connections between Satanism and Freemasonry with a Mason
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       No, I'd imagine not... they might inform you of what a spurious load of malarkey you're buying into.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ultimately those pages boil down to a simple problem: the sort of person who maintains a site like that is the sort of person who cannot sit in a Lodge with men of other religions and been at peace. That's fine. Let him stay outside. I couldn't be happier with that outcome.

       &lt;The light we perceive is a part only of the infinite light, the few solar rays which correspond with our visual apparatus. The sun itself is a lamp adjusted to our dim sight ; it is a luminous point in that space which wouId be darkness to the eyes of our body, but is resplendent for the intuition of our souls.
XXXVII.
The word magnetism expresses the action and not the nature of the great universal agent which serves as mediator between thought and life. This agent is the infinite light, or, seeing that the light is itself only phenomenal, it is rather the light-bearer, the great Lucifer of Nature, the mediator between matter and spirit, the first creature of God, but termed the devil by impostors and the ignorant.
XX X V III.
What is more absurd the devil, that is, to personified evil, and more impious than to attribute
the name of Lucifer to is the spirit of intelligence and love ; The intellectual Lucifer
it is the Paraclete, it is the Holy Spirit, while the physical Lucifer is the great agent of universal magnetism.
XXXIX.
To personify evil and exalt it into an intelligence which is the rival of God, into a being which can understand but love no more-this is a monstrous fiction. To believe that God permits this evil intelligence to deceive and destroy his feeble creatures is to make God more wicked than the devil. By depriving the devil of the possibility of love and repentance, God forces him to do evil. Moreover a spirit of error and falsehood can only be a folly which thinks, nor does it deserve indeed the name of spirit. The devil is God’s antithesis, and if we define God as He who is we must define His opposite as he who is not.

       Our back and forth is pointless. You've already closed your heart to Jesus. See, the biggest draw the devil has is that everything Jesus said isn't ok, is fine in the synagogue of Satan. The only things that aren't ok are the things Jesus says are right and just.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look at the world today and where it is in contrast to Revelation 17-18. We're damn near there. If you really want to see what Freemasonry is, was, and what will be, underneath the lies you can read "scarlet and the beast" but you don't want to know.
      </p>
      <p>
       You like being the smug smarmy ridiculer from your position of lowly Masonic power. It's nice to think you have it all figured out I know, I used to think I did too. But I didn't and still don't. But if you can't see how your religion, and yes it's a religion, is "Mystery Babylon, Mystery of the iniquities, the Mother of Harlots riding the beast (nice super bowl show last year huh) " then you're either blind, ignorant, don't care, or so caught up in triviality you miss the giant sign on the wall.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hopefully it's the latter, so I'll give you a little peek into the future. The beast allows you guys to ride it right up to near the end, then burns you alive. See he doesn't really like you for any other reason than you're human. Satan is a spirit and therefore needs humans to enact his plans in the material world. But once those trumpets ring you're useless.

       Why do you think "people" (do you mean me?!) dislike Christianity. There's absolutely nothing wrong with Christianity. Some of my best friends (and Brothers) are ministers.

      <p>
       Of course it is. Freemasonry has no dogma, and is not a religion, but it's patently obvious that its symbolism and forms are religious in nature.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is the center of the issue. If you can't distinguish between religious symbolism and a religion, then, yes, you shouldn't be a Freemason or join a philosophy study group or go see movies. Just hide indoors and hope no one tries to read Homer to you.

       I'm posting this comment once more, since you seem to have missed it, then I'm done talking with you. Your delusion is quite strong and I won't waste any more energy trying to show you the error of your statements. You can find a well referenced, from the pages of history and your own Masonic writings , complete expose' of Freemasonry in "Scarlet and the Beast" if you ever begin thinking for yourself again.

       Just citing other anti-Masonic screeds makes your case look even worse! You cannot bring to bear anything but the weakest "I found a line in this book written by a Mason that bothers me," so your give up and point to someone else's complaints about Freemasonry (they having horrible errors, omissions and other flaws all their own)

       It is common to hear posts how this sub is too religious, to which I reply that it doesn't seem this sub is that religious, but we reference religious tomes as sources of possible ancient wisdom.  References to great deluge is one example spanning multiple religious writings.

       Good post but I guess I won't be going into the NWO because the predominance of Luciferians in the world finally gave me the proof I needed to know there is a God. There can't be that many against something that isn't there. So I chose my side don't care who like it or doesn't.

       All organized religion is false. Even the so called Christian movement call Flat Earth. This movement is all about control using the BITE model. Read up on the BITE model on control, and you will see the Flat Earthers use it to full effect.

       Why should I worship an entity which coincidentally has an almost identical life story to Horus and Krishna? Who's life story was coincidentally written around the time of the Jewish Revolts against Roman Occupation by his disciples, and who's life story happened to fit the Hebrew's Messiah prophecy at a time when the Romans needed something to pacify the Jews and the Middle East?

       It's just another Imperial form of mind control. It makes you give into the human desire to feel special and have salvation while also saving the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       I hope one day you wake up from the form of conditioning that has grabbed you. Until then it will continue to control how you judge other people. Peace and love.

       The Jews reject Jesus.
      </p>
      <p>
       The story of Horus is nothing like Jesus.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was certainly used as mind control absolutely. Thats why sermons were given in Latin and not native tongues. They didn't want you to read it, only to have it dictated to you.
      </p>
      <p>
       And it isn't about saving the world for us. That's
 impossible for any man, and it's God's job. You can't save anyone else but yourself while trying to lead a life like Jesus' words said to. If you ignore everything in the Bible but those words, it's really quite simple. And yet really really hard.  So very few people do it, which makes it harder.  In fact, it's damn near impossible these days.

       I can try to answer your questions and thoughts, however I do not have 100% proof, so the answer must be believed in faith.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Why should I worship an entity which coincidentally has an almost identical life story to Horus and Krishna?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I've researched this myself.  And I agree that the life stories are identical.
      </p>
      <p>
       The short answer to this problem is: the fallen angels are allowed to exist here on Earth.  While the human population grew, the adversary (against God) created false religions, while inserting and retaining just enough knowledge of the truth into them, especially the plan for the future, for the one true Messiah/Son, Jesus Christ.
      </p>
      <p>
       This was all done to discredit God and the truth, and thereby stealing worship of God for himself/themselves, thus they copied the story for the future Messiah/Son and added it in their earlier, false religions (and multiplied the copy to other civilizations to accomplish exactly that which causes you to question God and Messiah/Son Jesus and not worship God and Jesus).
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course, I don’t have written proof of this, only what I’ve heard hear and there.  Believing all of this on faith is your decision.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Who's life story was coincidentally written around the time of the Jewish Revolts against Roman Occupation by his disciples, and who's life story happened to fit the Hebrew's Messiah prophecy at a time when the Romans needed something to pacify the Jews and the Middle East?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Perhaps it is coincidental because that was the true plan for the future and the Messiah/Son Jesus, and did occur as prophecized in the Hebrew’s scriptures (Old Testament writings).
      </p>
      <p>
       Additionally, Horus was not prophecized to manifest, as Jesus the Messiah had been in the Old Testament scriptures.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for Krishna and prophecy, the Hindu prophecy is the same as the Mayan prophecy, which furthers the claim that the Son/Messiah figure occurred in different cultures, and not just Egypt and India/Hindu-culture.  However, this prophecy may or may not have occurred yet, as it was generally believed to start on December 12, 2012 yet has not been presented on the world-scene so far as of 2017.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do acknowledge that the second coming of Jesus/Messiah has not occurred yet, however that prophecy is clearly stated in the book of Revelation, occurring after many other prophecies in that book within a short timeframe.
      </p>
      <p>
       The choice to believe (or not believe) is yours, obviously.
      </p>
      <p>
       I hope you choose Jesus the Messiah but I am biased for Jesus Christ.  I wish you the best either way.

       OP, I agree with your conclusions. The sad thing is it is so obvious that what's going on in the world parallels the Book of Revelation so clearly yet people can't see it, they have been deceived. I mean for pete sake, it even references a one world government! So many lies have corrupted the whole world. Christ is the way the truth and the life. People just don't realize how good a liar Satan is.

       John 8:44 "Ye are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father ye will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a liar, and the father of it."
      </p>
      <p>
       The Bible is the truth, Romans 3:4 "let God be true, but every man a liar"

       Additionally the RFID implant/chip that has been showing up all over the internet and news reports is another prophecy in the book of 
Revelation - chapter 13, verse 16-17:
"16 And he causeth all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to receive a mark in their right hand, or in their foreheads:
      </p>
      <p>
       17 And that no man might buy or sell, save he that had the mark, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name."

       The mark of the beast will be the ultimate divider of men. If one doesn't accept the mark, which is essentially Satan's brand, they will be unable to have access to any form of commerce. This prophecy is the big one that should red pill some. The company that recently microchipped its employees was something to ponder. Would you go for it?

       I don't think any true Christian would. But I don't think that happens until after the rapture. The only ones left in the world would be the 144k "the saints", plus any subsequent converts.

       We (Freemasons) are not the outward expression of anything. We're one of many independent elements of the broad sweep of the Western initiatic tradition (which, keep in mind, included Christianity for the first couple hundred years, until baptism was simplified and expedited... until then, baptism was a full-on initiation requiring years of preparation).

       Ignoring the naming glitches, there, you're wrong. Jehovah's Witnesses were not founded by Freemasons (they often met in Masonic halls before they got established, as did many minor churches at the time who could not afford their own buildings). It was also popular to meet in Odd Fellows halls for the same reasons.

       Look, I write Masonic education programs. But if you're starting with a conclusion and looking for a book that, even minutely supports your desired conclusion, the writing of millions of Masons over 300+ years will certainly allow you to justify just about anything.

       Are you aware the catholic church pretty much set every guideline you as a Christian follow? Minds like Augustine, Thomas Aquinas and Hildegard were all Catholic thinkers though Protestantism likes to claim them.
      </p>
      <p>
       The church is a community throughout time and so we ask saints to pray to the lord for us. Its perfectly licit; like when you ask a friend to submit your application to the boss for you since he already works there. There is nothing wrong with prayer beads and we do not worship any images. With that logic what ISN'T a graven image?

        The Blue Degrees are but the outer court or portico of the Temple. Part of the symbols are displayed there to the Initiate, but he is intentionally misled by false interpretations. It is not intended that he shall understand them; but it is intended that he shall imagine he understands them.. .and who so attempts to undeceive them will labor in vain

       And laboring in vain I have been! Looks like I've learned more about your religion and its history in my last day's reading, than a member who writes their educational pamphlets, interesting!

       I'm posting this comment once more, since you seem to have missed it, then I'm done talking with you. Your delusion is quite strong and I won't waste any more energy trying to show you the error of your statements. You can find a well referenced, from the pages of history and your own Masonic writings , complete expose' of Freemasonry in "Scarlet and the Beast" if you ever begin thinking for yourself again.
