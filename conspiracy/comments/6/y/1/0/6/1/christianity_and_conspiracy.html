        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>There is a definite anti Christian sentiment in this sub, and while I can see why there would be something of that nature heavily permeating standard society, I&#39;m a little surprised to find such a knee jerk reaction from theorists here.</p>

<p>Most of you here have done enough research to know that the ancient mystery religions and their outward expressions such as the Freemasons, Illuminati, etc all exist and control places of high office and unappointed major non-governmental power.  They are the movers and shakers of the world we live in. Centralizing power, clearing the path for top-down world domination.  Most of you can agree to that right?</p>

<p>But very few seem to really ask <em>why</em>? What&#39;s the point of all this, the ever quicker centralizing of power across every industry. The slower yet unrelenting twisting of Christ&#39;s actual teachings into something they are not, while using the Catholic Church, Scientologyand other offshoot &quot;Christianlike&quot; religions such as Christ Church of science, Mormons, Jehovah&#39;s witnesses, most of which were founded by, you guessed it, Freemasons. </p>

<p>For the answer to <em>why</em> all this deception, corruption, centralization, the constant attack on our psyche via false left/right black/white rich/poor paradigm&#39;s that are pushed on us across every media outlet, and even larger of importance the recent permeation of the ancient mystery beliefs that have been quickly pushed into our thoughts as a &quot;new&quot; way to look at the Bible, <strong>all you have to do is read the &quot;mystery&quot; groups own teachings on how to push their agenda.</strong></p>

<p>These people believe <strong>FULLY</strong> in higher powers. It is Luciferian ideology <strong>to its core.</strong> They believe Lucifer to be a &quot;God.&quot; Which of this plane he <em>is</em> in control.  And Jesus, while also a God, is the bad guy, Adonai.</p>

<p>All their work is to bring the world to a place where 1 &quot;person&quot;, their god, can take control of everything. All the centralizing, the Amazon&#39;s, Google&#39;s, Facebook&#39;s, UN, all of it is to prepare for this. <strong>And it&#39;s working.</strong> </p>

<p>13 But woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye shut up the kingdom of heaven against men: for ye neither go in yourselves, neither suffer ye them that are entering to go in.</p>

<p>Anyone ready to look at their plan and how it&#39;s been carried out over the last century can download a copy of 
&quot;Externalisation of the Hierarchy&quot; by Alice Bailey for free online. It outlines how they would inflitrate, device, and influence religion, Freemasonry, government, and centralize all these powers for the return of their own Christ. Lucifer. The Antichrist spoken of in Revelation. It all lines up with the teachings of Jesus about the end of this world, and is a absolute match for the &quot;Mystery Babylon&quot; harlot and beasts spoken of by John of Patmos in Revelation. </p>

<p>I know many of the commenters here will berate me, downvote into oblivion, call me names etc and I don&#39;t care. A lot of that will come from the puppets and their organizers that have taken over the content of this sub.  But maybe someone will see it so that&#39;s all ok with me. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve had this account for awhile now, used to post here quite a bit under other psuedonyms years ago before the sub hit 100k subscribers and was thereafter flooded by the agencies. Haven&#39;t posted since then because I saw it as dangerous. Names on a list and all that, but I don&#39;t care anymore:</p>

<p>&quot;Lucifer comes to give us the final … Luciferic initiation … that many people now and in the days ahead, will be facing—for it is an initiation into the New Age. … No one will enter the New World Order unless he or she will make a pledge to worship Lucifer. No one will enter the New Age unless he will take a Luciferian initiation.&quot;  </p>

<p>Globe earth. Media. Social engineering. All designed for us to do everything the bible says is wrong.</p>

<p>You should follow the advice of the great like jesus and search for G-d within you. The temple of G-d is within you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Riffing off that point it makes sense.</p>

<p>I agree with you both that satan is the ruler of this world and man is a fallen creature so it would follow the world at large is pretty messed up.</p>

<p>Should the elite occult actually be aligning themselves with lucifer, directly or indirectly would explain their personal wealth as well as their agenda.</p>

<p>Lucifer is the great deciever, and can even appear as an &quot;angel of light&quot;. He offered Jesus in the desert all the kingdoms of this world. And has been given the power to deliver. Jesus as the Son of God  denied it. How many men these days could/would deny such a thing?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah that reaction can be a pain.</p>

<p>I think its in the culture of conspiracy to see longstanding organizations like the Catholic church and think &quot;there&#39;s gotta be something going on&quot;</p>

<p>Also are you trying to say its the Catholic church contorting the teaching of Christ? Cause that was almost certainly Protestantism like you mention. If anyone has a proper teaching on Christ its Cathorthodoxy </p>

<p>I mean Christ literally say thou art rock(petras) and on this rock I will build my church.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It was infiltrated ages ago. Jesus is the only &quot;father&quot;, and hearer of repentance. Some pedophiliac priest can&#39;t grant you forgiveness for your sins with a few chants.

    <div class="md"><p>Infiltrated by who? and can you be more specific than ages, its been a couple thousand years. When exactly did it lose its course.</p>

<p>Please don&#39;t take a couple bad apples and think the whole bunch is bad. Unfortunately pedo&#39;s will take any position as long as it means children. The theology, philosophy and history are still strong.</p>

<p>Are you aware the catholic church pretty much set every guideline you as a Christian follow? Minds like Augustine, Thomas Aquinas and Hildegard were all Catholic thinkers though Protestantism likes to claim them.</p>

<p>The church is a community throughout time and so we ask saints to pray to the lord for us. Its perfectly licit; like when you ask a friend to submit your application to the boss for you since he already works there. There is nothing wrong with prayer beads and we do not worship any images. With that logic what ISN&#39;T a graven image?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Now i personally don&#39;t subscribe to sola scriptura but if the church was hijacked wouldn&#39;t that mean that Christ was wrong when he said &quot;and the gates of hell will not triumph over it&quot;</p>

<p>So who&#39;s lying? If THE church was corrupted what&#39;s the real one now? Cause there&#39;s been a few thousand splits. Is god currently with the American Church of the Light of Christ? Or maybe the Episcopalian charismatic movement? These are made up churches but you get my point.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;ve decided, or had it decided for you,  that the Catholic Church has been assigned Jesus&#39;s church. Jesus has a few very simple rules to follow. No named church is Jesus&#39; church. He isn&#39;t the champion of one brand of christianity over another. Christ&#39;s church isn&#39;t a brick and mortar building with a symbol on the wall. It is the group of people, regardless of the named organized religion we call it they &quot;belong to&quot;, that follow HIS teachings. His church is made up of every race color and creed, so long as they follow his teachings. Which are quite simple.</p>

<p>&quot;Don&#39;t lie, and don&#39;t do what you hate, because all things are disclosed before heaven. After all, there is nothing hidden that will not be revealed, and there is nothing covered up that will remain undisclosed.&quot;</p>

<p>“love the Lord your God” (Matt. 22:37) and “love your neighbor as yourself” (v.39)</p>

<p>That&#39;s it. No stand up sit down. No confessionals to corrupted institutions. No hail Marys. No observation of some archaic diet. No earthly institution.</p>

<p>Christ&#39;s church isn&#39;t physical, it&#39;s spiritual.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s some heresy or another.</p>

<p>I just find it ironic that when you quote the bible as you do you are to some extent trusting the (original) church that compiled and translated the bible. </p>

<p>Anyone could read the bible and get any number of interpretations. Without an authority to teach it it loses all meaning. I mean shit the church exercised that authority when they chose what to put in the bible.</p>

<p>Why did God come to Earth if the church is only spiritual? Why in the old testament did the jews build the temple and Why did Christ cleanse the temple if there is no meaning in brick and mortar?</p>

<p>Have you ever read John 6?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you notice, not all of those quotes were from the Bible. The gospel of Thomas was left out of cannon, however can be traced back to Jesus time like Matthew Mark Luke and John. I trust those books in the KJV Bible because the newer versions like to change words. Removing some and changing others, like the change from &quot;cornerstone&quot; to &quot;capstone&quot;. The cornerstone is the 1st block laid and the capstone, the last. And while yes, I&#39;m sure some of Jesus&#39;sayings were left out of, or slightly changed in the cannonical scripture, when you cross reference them with Thomas, which wasn&#39;t rediscovered and translated until 1945, it fits. Now there were a plethora of other gnostic teachings discovered along with that text, but they don&#39;t closely match the scriptures. </p>

<p>Maybe you don&#39;t realize it, or maybe you do and that&#39;s the point, but you&#39;ve immediately gone on the offensive, attacking me without bothering to read the information I&#39;ve provided, called me a heretic, and are even using arguments to attack what I&#39;ve said here that are used to  turn people away from any Christian religion. All of these tactics are spelled out in the very book you refuse to read. </p>

<p>Either way this conversation isn&#39;t going anywhere. Good day.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well it sounded like you were denying the Trinity which is literally heresy. The KJV isn&#39;t really the best source because its missing 3 books of the original canon and isn&#39;t even that good an a translation to boot. If you want accuracy but can&#39;t read do Latin try the Douay Rheims. One of the closest translations as its based on the vulgate directly to English.</p>

<p>You told me to read a whole boom so i can understand your viewpoints but the initial points you made were arguments the church has been dealing with for over hundreds of years.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We are of one body as we are all baptised in Christ. And later in that Paul lays down a type of hierarchy similar to the church (not all are apostles etc)</p>

<p>But we are also one body in Christ as a church as we are all on communion with Christ. How are we in communion with him? Because we eat of the bread of heaven. We eat Christ and so are in communion with him.</p>

<p>That is why he puts such stress on &#39;this is my body&#39; and also why it mentions that many discisples left because of that hard teaching- its literal. He goes on to say &#39;do this in memory of me&#39; which is why the apostles were gathered on Pentecost iirc-they were breaking the bread. Thats Christ gave Peter than authority to the church- so it would Have order and so we can continue his work-all subsisting on the same bread from heaven: Christ himself .</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My beef is with organized religion. And the premise of christianity that there is only one path to salvation bothers me as a very typical manmade control trope.</p>

<p>That said, I agree with most of what you say here. And as always, what I believe doesn&#39;t matter. What the bad guys believe does. They are going to think and act in such a way to create the best possible environment for their beliefs to flourish. And they are demonstrably evil believing motherfuckers.</p>

<p>So, I don&#39;t have a problem with Christians. I don&#39;t agree with them on the nature of reality, but I don&#39;t need to. Our goals have enough in common to almost entirely ally myself with them. And where are beliefs are different, it literally doesn&#39;t matter on our little spinning rock here in any practical way.</p>

<p>So carry on there jesus people! I understand you are on the good guys team.</p>

<p>Um... Me? I&#39;m not a Christian. I&#39;m a Jesus fan boy at best, but I don&#39;t believe in Christian dogma.</p>

<p>That&#39;s a rare quality. Aristotle once said that it was the mark of an educated mind to be able to be able to entertain a thought without accepting it. You appear to have such a mind.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>It requires context. When you realize that &quot;charity&quot; in 1 Corinthians isn&#39;t giving money to the poor, but a universal love, thanks whole book, and especially chapter 13 becomes stunningly beautiful. The idea that the founder of a religion would say that it&#39;s all meaningless if you can&#39;t feel a love for all mankind. That kind of shocks me. I can only think of one other who focused so heavily on how you perceive others when founding a religion: Siddhārtha Gautama, AKA The Buddha.</p>

<p>Why do you think that a web page that says, essentially, &quot;this evidence is false,&quot; has more authority than the evidence in question?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If King James was a Freemason who turned the 1611 KJV over to Rosicrucians for editing...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>?! What the heck are you talking about? I said nothing about Rosicrucians or editing of the Bible. The only editing that I&#39;m aware of James being accused of was in ensuring that a passage referring to poisoning became a condemnation of witches.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>why did he prosecute and execute occultists as criminals</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Mostly because he was a paranoid fanatic, hell-bent on wiping out those who he imagined worked against him. Not really someone I&#39;m proud of being a Mason, but there it is.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>No, it says there&#39;s no primary source. There certainly is rather solid secondary source evidence, and this correlates well with what little we know of Freemasonry and James at that time. There are very few men for whom we have any primary source evidence of their membership prior to the founding of the Grand Lodge of England in 1717. But we do know of many men who were almost certainly members, and James is on that list.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Rosicrucianism and masonry go hand in hand.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You didn&#39;t make a vague claim about similarities or even connections. You specifically brought up a claim about James handing the Bible off for editing to Rosicrucians. I never made this claim. Don&#39;t put words in my mouth.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You must believe in a higher power to be a member.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes you must. But why do you think that a religious <em>requirement</em> makes a group a religion? I know groups from go-cart racing teams to philosophical discussion groups that require members to be some specific religion. Surely you&#39;re not claiming that they&#39;re religions too?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You must follow their tenants for living and how you act.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nope. The moral lessons of Freemasonry are entirely advisory. No one tells me how I should apply those lessons in my life, any more than a college forces you to apply their lessons in a specific way. Freemasonry is the college of moral philosophy. It&#39;s as simple (and complex) as that.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>That&#39;s religion my friend.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Religion involves a proscribed, usually dogmatic belief. Freemasonry has no such thing. It has a bar that you must meet to join: you have to believe in some sort of a supreme being. That&#39;s the end of it. No one will tell you how or what to believe, how to worship or what traditions to observe in the course of that worship. That&#39;s all between you and your church... your <em>religion</em>.</p>

<p>There are Freemasons who are Christian, Muslim, Jewish, deist, pantheist, Hindu, Buddhist, and numerous other smaller religions. If Freemasonry were a religion, this would not be possible.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh my... that&#39;s ... I need to go wash out my eyes.</p>

<p>Are you seriously expecting me to rebut that rolling screed?! Pick a topic, at least... there&#39;s dozens of claims there. Most are just, &quot;we interpret Freemasonry this way, and that&#39;s naughty,&quot; sorts of subjective claims that can&#39;t be refuted.</p>

<p>Just as an example the claim about Freemasonry having form of &quot;salvation&quot; hinges on interpreting several quotations about desiring a positive afterlife as promoting a specific form of salvation. If you were inclined to interpret them that way, good for you, but that doesn&#39;t mean that the next Brother does, and the proof isn&#39;t in what you can interpret the degrees as meaning; the proof is in demonstrating that someone will tell you that you&#39;re wrong to interpret the degrees however you like. If they do, then that&#39;s not philosophy, it&#39;s a religion. Thankfully, Freemasonry is about philosophy and is not a religion, so no one will tell you any such thing.</p>

<p>However, I love this proviso:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We do not recommend discussing the connections between Satanism and Freemasonry with a Mason</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, I&#39;d imagine not... they might inform you of what a spurious load of malarkey you&#39;re buying into.</p>

<p>Ultimately those pages boil down to a simple problem: the sort of person who maintains a site like that is the sort of person who cannot sit in a Lodge with men of other religions and been at peace. That&#39;s fine. Let him stay outside. I couldn&#39;t be happier with that outcome.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&lt;The light we perceive is a part only of the infinite light, the few solar rays which correspond with our visual apparatus. The sun itself is a lamp adjusted to our dim sight ; it is a luminous point in that space which wouId be darkness to the eyes of our body, but is resplendent for the intuition of our souls.
XXXVII.
The word magnetism expresses the action and not the nature of the great universal agent which serves as mediator between thought and life. This agent is the infinite light, or, seeing that the light is itself only phenomenal, it is rather the light-bearer, the great Lucifer of Nature, the mediator between matter and spirit, the first creature of God, but termed the devil by impostors and the ignorant.
XX X V III.
What is more absurd the devil, that is, to personified evil, and more impious than to attribute
the name of Lucifer to is the spirit of intelligence and love ; The intellectual Lucifer
it is the Paraclete, it is the Holy Spirit, while the physical Lucifer is the great agent of universal magnetism.
XXXIX.
To personify evil and exalt it into an intelligence which is the rival of God, into a being which can understand but love no more-this is a monstrous fiction. To believe that God permits this evil intelligence to deceive and destroy his feeble creatures is to make God more wicked than the devil. By depriving the devil of the possibility of love and repentance, God forces him to do evil. Moreover a spirit of error and falsehood can only be a folly which thinks, nor does it deserve indeed the name of spirit. The devil is God’s antithesis, and if we define God as He who is we must define His opposite as he who is not.</p>

<p>Look at the world today and where it is in contrast to Revelation 17-18. We&#39;re damn near there. If you really want to see what Freemasonry is, was, and what will be, underneath the lies you can read &quot;scarlet and the beast&quot; but you don&#39;t want to know. </p>

<p>You like being the smug smarmy ridiculer from your position of lowly Masonic power. It&#39;s nice to think you have it all figured out I know, I used to think I did too.

But if you can&#39;t see how your religion, and yes it&#39;s a religion, is &quot;Mystery Babylon, Mystery of the iniquities, the Mother of Harlots riding the beast (nice super bowl show last year huh) &quot; then you&#39;re either blind, ignorant, don&#39;t care, or so caught up in triviality you miss the giant sign on the wall. </p>

<p>Hopefully it&#39;s the latter, so I&#39;ll give you a little peek into the future. The beast allows you guys to ride it right up to near the end, then burns you alive.

<p>The story of Horus is nothing like Jesus. </p>

<p>It was certainly used as mind control absolutely. Thats why sermons were given in Latin and not native tongues. They didn&#39;t want you to read it, only to have it dictated to you.  </p>

<p>And it isn&#39;t about saving the world for us. That&#39;s
 impossible for any man, and it&#39;s God&#39;s job. You can&#39;t save anyone else but yourself while trying to lead a life like Jesus&#39; words said to. If you ignore everything in the Bible but those words, it&#39;s really quite simple. And yet really really hard.  So very few people do it, which makes it harder.

    <div class="md"><p>I can try to answer your questions and thoughts, however I do not have 100% proof, so the answer must be believed in faith.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why should I worship an entity which coincidentally has an almost identical life story to Horus and Krishna? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;ve researched this myself.  And I agree that the life stories are identical.</p>

<p>The short answer to this problem is: the fallen angels are allowed to exist here on Earth.  While the human population grew, the adversary (against God) created false religions, while inserting and retaining just enough knowledge of the truth into them, especially the plan for the future, for the one true Messiah/Son, Jesus Christ.  </p>

<p>This was all done to discredit God and the truth, and thereby stealing worship of God for himself/themselves, thus they copied the story for the future Messiah/Son and added it in their earlier, false religions (and multiplied the copy to other civilizations to accomplish exactly that which causes you to question God and Messiah/Son Jesus and not worship God and Jesus).</p>

<p>Of course, I don’t have written proof of this, only what I’ve heard hear and there.  Believing all of this on faith is your decision. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Who&#39;s life story was coincidentally written around the time of the Jewish Revolts against Roman Occupation by his disciples, and who&#39;s life story happened to fit the Hebrew&#39;s Messiah prophecy at a time when the Romans needed something to pacify the Jews and the Middle East?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Perhaps it is coincidental because that was the true plan for the future and the Messiah/Son Jesus, and did occur as prophecized in the Hebrew’s scriptures (Old Testament writings).</p>

<p>Additionally, Horus was not prophecized to manifest, as Jesus the Messiah had been in the Old Testament scriptures.</p>

<p>As for Krishna and prophecy, the Hindu prophecy is the same as the Mayan prophecy, which furthers the claim that the Son/Messiah figure occurred in different cultures, and not just Egypt and India/Hindu-culture.  However, this prophecy may or may not have occurred yet, as it was generally believed to start on December 12, 2012 yet has not been presented on the world-scene so far as of 2017.</p>

<p>I do acknowledge that the second coming of Jesus/Messiah has not occurred yet, however that prophecy is clearly stated in the book of Revelation, occurring after many other prophecies in that book within a short timeframe.</p>

<p>The choice to believe (or not believe) is yours, obviously.</p>

<p>I hope you choose Jesus the Messiah but I am biased for Jesus Christ.  I wish you the best either way.</p>

Jehovah&#39;s Witnesses were not founded by Freemasons (they often met in Masonic halls before they got established, as did many minor churches at the time who could not afford their own buildings). It was also popular to meet in Odd Fellows halls for the same reasons.</p>

<p>Look, I write Masonic education programs. But if you&#39;re starting with a conclusion and looking for a book that, even minutely supports your desired conclusion, the writing of millions of Masons over 300+ years will certainly allow you to justify just about anything.</p>

<p>Are you talking about Alice Bailey?</p>

<p>No one has any control over what you read. How would you propose such control could work?!</p>

<p>Please don&#39;t take a couple bad apples and think the whole bunch is bad. Unfortunately pedo&#39;s will take any position as long as it means children. The theology, philosophy and history are still strong.</p>

<p>Are you aware the catholic church pretty much set every guideline you as a Christian follow? Minds like Augustine, Thomas Aquinas and Hildegard were all Catholic thinkers though Protestantism likes to claim them.</p>

<p>The church is a community throughout time and so we ask saints to pray to the lord for us. Its perfectly licit; like when you ask a friend to submit your application to the boss for you since he already works there. There is nothing wrong with prayer beads and we do not worship any images. With that logic what ISN&#39;T a graven image?</p>

<p>And laboring in vain I have been! Looks like I&#39;ve learned more about your religion and its history in my last day&#39;s reading, than a member who writes their educational pamphlets, interesting!</p>

<p>I&#39;m posting this comment once more, since you seem to have missed it, then I&#39;m done talking with you. Your delusion is quite strong and I won&#39;t waste any more energy trying to show you the error of your statements. You can find a well referenced, from the pages of history and your own Masonic writings , complete expose&#39; of Freemasonry in &quot;Scarlet and the Beast&quot; if you ever begin thinking for yourself again. </p>

<p>Goodbye.</p>
