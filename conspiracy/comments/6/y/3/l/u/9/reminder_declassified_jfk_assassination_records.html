<blockquote>
<p>This explosion at the JFK Library may or may not have been related, but police are investigating it as though it is, he said. But he later added that they believe it was related.</p>

<p>A third explosion “that we believe is related” occurred at the John F. Kennedy Library, Boston police commissioner Ed Davis said at a press conference.</p>

<p>That explosion occurred at about 4:30, after the others at the marathon finish line. Library officials had originally said it was an electrical fire.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure if they were successful at destroying the assassination records or not. Was the bombing used to divert attention while records were destroyed or altered? I guess we may find out this October. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>According to the Act, all records previously withheld either in part or in full should be released on October 26, 2017, unless authorized for further withholding by the President of the United States.</p>

<p>Edit: I&#39;m putting additional information up here from my comments for easy reading and in case they are buried. Since someone questioned the accuracy of my claim that records related to the JFK assassination are at the JFK Library that caught fire (possibly from a bomb), here&#39;s proof those records are there. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Who knows what really happened. For all we know, the bombers were groomed by a federal agency or another country and were &quot;guided&quot; towards their target to be used as a distraction for the real operation, which could have been to switch out, steal, or destroy specific JFK assassination documents that they thought would be released in a short time. From all of the news reports, since people heard a bomb go off at the library, either the Boston bombers put it there, or it was placed there by another party to go off at the same time and was to be blamed on the bombers. Maybe something got botched and one of the bombers changed his mind last minute and went after a crowd full of people with one of the bombs instead of the Library because maybe he knew it was for another purpose. </p>

<p>It&#39;s just like the question of how many licks it takes to get to the center of a tootsie pop. We may never know. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh, I think we know...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Sean Gannon: I’m going to start off with some little-known facts. I trained at the same martial arts school as the Boston Bomber, Tamerlan Tsarnaev for YEARS. I also spent years as a member of BRIC (Boston Regional Intelligence Center). Here is an old article from a conspiracy website entitled “Six Degrees of Sean Gannon” <a href="http://carriemath.blogspot.com/2014/01/six-degrees-of-sean-gannon.html">http://carriemath.blogspot.com/2014/01/six-degrees-of-sean-gannon.html</a> describing some of the events that went down and the connection I had to them. It concludes with “Knowing Sean Gannon will lead to death 5 out of 6 times.” It’s one of those conspiracy theories that actually happens to be somewhat true … except they’re WAY underestimating the body count.</p>

<p>I’m going to lay out some little known (so far) facts here. Tamerlan Tsarnaev was an FBI asset. He was an FBI asset for a LONG time. Those times he got thrown out of the Cambridge mosque for being “too radical”? He was a “Mosque Crawler” – one of those FBI informants that pretend to be a radical so he can wrap up real Muslims in FBI stings with 20-year sentences. The people of that mosque were the good Muslims, people that just wanted to be good Americans, a better life for their children, and to not make more problems for their Muslim brothers. They tossed him out on his ass. They also probably suspected he was an informant as well.</p>

<p>Did it ever sound strange to anyone that Russia explicitly warned us he was a terrorist upon his return to the US, but somehow the message got “misplaced.” It wasn’t “misplaced” we’re the ones that SENT him over there to act like a radical in the first place. Some say the Russians are paranoid. Well, it’s not paranoia when they really ARE out to get you. I don’t know enough about Russian regional politics to know exactly what he was doing over there, but I can assure you it wasn’t for the benefit of the Russians. After many years of struggle and sacrifice, Putin had finally managed to establish a degree of peace between Chechens and Russians, Muslims and Christians. Tamerlan was there to undermine that, and who was going to suffer? Innocent Russians dead in terrorist attacks and the good Muslims who would be blamed for what the pawns were doing.</p>

<p>In Dagestan, Tamerlan formed a friendship with another young Muslim named William Plotnikov. They had very similar backgrounds, both had fled the former Soviet Union, both were elite amateur boxers in North America, both (allegedly) were devout Muslims and had a lot of other things in common. There were a lot of things that made Tamerlan identify with Plotnikov. Plotnikov was then killed in a shootout between police and militants in Dagestan. Two days later Tamerlan returned to the US.</p>

<p>This is when the REAL radicalization of Tamerlan took place. I saw the difference in his face and manner as soon as he got back to the gym. He had always taken his prayer breaks in the gym before (we never had to wonder what direction Mecca was) but now they had a special intensity. He had grown a big beard to impress the radicals overseas, but it grew even bigger now that he actually meant it. Muslim brotherhood is a very real thing. Betraying your fellow Muslims is one of the worst things a Muslim can do. It’s actually the number one way the FBI and Israelis get you guys every time. Once you have betrayed your people in the smallest way, you are now a marked man for life if they ever release that information. Your family, your friends, your own mother will disown you. That means THEY now own you, body and soul. <strong>Tamerlan’s only way out now was murderous martyrdom. And he was going to take as many people with him as possible.</strong></p>

<p>A Boston Police spokesperson told Talking Points Memo on Monday that an explosive device had gone off at the library. This information was later clarified on Twitter by BPD Public Information Bureau Chief Cheryl Fiandaca, who described the incident as “fire related.”</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There were a few repeated attempts to remove fire related material off the wikipedia page on the library (first few attempts were marked vandalism and the associated ip was from ). </p>

<p>However, third or fourth attempt was a bit more sophisticated and finally succeeded. It was a very gargantuan edit. So subterfuge through information overload. Do a simple keyword search for &#39;fire&#39; and you see the relevant targeted section that was edited: </p>

    <div class="md"><p>mostly that account is associated with automated copyright deletions. Copyright deletions on a wiki edit history page is the ONLY way you can permanently delete old versions of a wiki page and prevent a reverse forking back of to the original trunk. Irreversible permanent deletions. </p>

<p>Quite outrageous. I hope there are open source projects that combine with way-back machine or their own mechanism to make the public be able to keep page edit histories. Wiki page edit history is very telling on any politicized subject, and very telling of motivations of any group who has a strong interest in changing content on certain matters.</p>
