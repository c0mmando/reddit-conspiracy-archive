       Lol, I feel kinda bad because I think Carlwood and Co actually made their own music... But it still sucks really bad.  They should take some lessons from John B Wells.  He has made some pretty good music for CTM.

       Well there is no "&amp; co" accept for the guests. I'm just a one man operation. As for the song, I wrote lyrics I thought covered all the bases sufficiently, and hired a guy.
      </p>
      <p>
       I like it, but preferred the original, which I had to stop using cause I didn't own the music. The intro tends to split the crowd. What makes it so bad in your opinion?

       It's perfect! It reminds me of all my favorite unheard of indie bands one can find scouring Bandcamp! Minus all the whiney liberal garbage lyrical content! Everything you do is perfect, man. Even if it's not relevant to my interests it's still perfect! Keep it up and keep taking my monies!

       The dudes voice is like fingernails on the chalkwood. plus his singing style is somewhere between a lounge singer and beat poet. Never heard people sing that way. Lyrics aren't terrible.

       Oh wow!  Thanks for the reply dude!
      </p>
      <p>
       Well, I tend to have a bit of a heavy handed approach to musical taste being a musician myself.  Anyhow, that being said.  The lyrics are good, accurately paint a narrative of conspiracy in general and well thought out.  It is the singer that isn't very good.  He is completely out of key and is forcing his tone (easy to tell, doesn't use chest when vocalizing).  This gives a hokey fake feel to his singing because it is an unnatural or untrained vocalization.  The music it's self is so-so... very bright and simple... doesn't match the theme of your lyrics.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not that you asked, but I'd recommend a different musical style, something more ominous paired with your lyrics.  As for a vocalist, someone who can naturally sing or has trained their voice.  Perhaps someone who can sing in deeper tones, or is skilled in a variety of styles.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again thanks, really cool for you to reply!  I feel like I've met someone famous!  Spurred an uptick in my mood this afternoon.  Have a great weekend and look forward to the AMA!

       Well, if you ever want to take the same lyrics and do your own cover, if I like I'd be more than willing to play it on occasion and give you a shout out in the notes. Thanks for listening either way.

       It's very jarring, I usually skip it. It's nowhere near as jarring as the older intro where someone is mashing the pound key tho.

       These days I check THC before I'll check jre. Too many boring guests and ignorance on jre. I feel like Joe has 1 good podcast in 5, and Greg has got 4 good ones out of 5

       one of the best interviewers out there right now.

       Greg is ALWAYS informed on the guest's work - whether he believes in the stuff or not.

       He is one of the best and his intros always make the interviewee blush lol.

       Huh. I like THC, particularly because he casts such a wide umbrella and finds people talking about theories I've never heard of.
      </p>
      <p>
       The weakest part of his show, though, is that he doesn't really interview people--he just lets them talk about their thing. And that's not a bad thing, obviously that's the point of the show. But compare him to someone like Howard Hughes on The Unexplained, and you see the difference between that style and a professional interviewer. Hughes asks questions that challenge his guests to go beyond the elevator pitch and their scripted spiel.

       what I like about Greg is that he knows the material for each person he speaks with. I agree with you that the interviewee does most of the talking but Greg keeps them on track.
      </p>
      <p>
       He knows what is going to be the most interesting or informative to the listener and keeps them on track by asking leading questions that allow them to stay on the important points.
      </p>
      <p>
       I understand your point but the part you think is the weakest, is actually the strongest in my opinion. I just really like his show and I love that he keeps his own ego out of the mix while still guiding the talk.

       Yeah, it's definitely a question of personal taste.
      </p>
      <p>
       When it's someone with a totally new idea I've never heard of, I do prefer letting them say whatever they want. When it's someone talking about something I've heard before, I'd rather they get pushed to cover new ground and challenged a little bit.
      </p>
      <p>
       And then there's the pretty rare case where someone is just obviously bullshitting. A strong interviewer shouldn't let them get away with it, both out of respect for the audience and because calling it out makes really interesting radio (as it were).
      </p>
      <p>
       The THC example that comes to mind is the guy who claimed he'd been cloned and tortured into creating Top 40 hits for the music business, but couldn't actually name the dozens of songs he claimed to have written--that was a fascinating episode, but also rough to listen to because (IMO) the guy was probably mentally ill. Felt a little exploitative for Carlwood to just keep him talking without either taking his theories seriously enough to ask serious questions or backing off to avoid taking advantage of a sick person. Kind of the worst of both worlds.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, like I said, I do like and listen to the show. He seems to be settling in as a professional podcaster, and I hope he gets a little more assertive and develops his voice and role as the host.

       Yeah, I guess I'd say he's a better interviewer when he's
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       talking about himself, but then I'm just special pleading.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do think he's better overall, but I have a pretty high tolerance for his discussions of the weather, his health, the radio business, and his parents. And Carlwood has more interesting guests for the most part.
      </p>
      <p>
       I guess I just want Carlwood to challenge his guests a little bit when they're obviously bullshitting. It's so much more interesting than just letting them run a line on the audience.

       I was in retail management hell for about 10 years.  I went from decoding birthday cakes at Great American Cookies in a Missouri mall, to begging people to buy overpriced shades for Sunglass Hut, and eventually working my way up in Gamestop. About 4 years ago, I felt comfortable enough to tell my boss I wouldn't be coming in anymore, because the podcast I've been doing on the side, is doing well enough to break off the chains. One of the best days of my life.

       How much money is your podcast making you a year Greg? It isn't cheap to live in San Diego.  I wasn't aware there was so much money to be made "selling" conspiracy.. You must be making 50K a year, not bad!   Do you ever have guests pay you to be on the show and promote their products?  What are the other revenue streams you are using to support the San Diego life off a once a once, or twice a week podcast?

       Your father, a Freemason, right?

       Ugh. My father has never known a Freemason. The burden of proof is on you. Go searching, I would love that.
      </p>
      <p>
       And yeah, I'm doing pretty well. If you knew anything about the history of THC, you'd know about the Moneybomb. I was a donation only show and was giving half of that money, hundreds a month, back to a random listener. Has anyone ever done that? I'm the guy you want to attack in this way?
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes, I make money "selling conspiracy." I suppose we all many money at what we're good at. We all have to do something.  I could have hosted a lot of different types of shows. Ones where I wouldn't have had to turn down the advertising offers I've gotten.
      </p>
      <p>
       I like what I do. I think the record speaks for itself, and it's the Plus members that allow me to put out 5 hours of free show a month. I think THC's existence has been a net win. For me getting out of a depressing situation stuck in retail, for many researchers, for many listeners, and dozens of people that I gave money to in the Moneybomb days. I also tip my servers well, is that anything?

       So, your father has "never known a Freemason" weird way to answer that.. I guess you know everything and everyone your dad knows.. oookay.. and you personally have no connection to Freemasonry, right Greg? (except your bumper sticker, which is "just a joke" and all the guests you have on all the time and all the symbols you use over and over again as marketing material)? I just want to get this on the record. You are saying you are in no way whatsoever connected to freemasonry?
      </p>
      <p>
       The "moneybomb" yeah, that's a very noble cause you had there. Certainly, in no way could human psychology be manipulated into donating more to a show with an ever growing "pot of money" that might be won - where people can win money back.. Certainly that type of system has never been used to get money out of people, except oh yeah, the lottery!  Noble cause of course!  I haven't heard you mention the "moneybomb" recently, has it been discontinued? That's too bad.
      </p>
      <p>
       What is the grand total you are making a year to "drink a little drink, and smoke a little smoke" so often in San Diego, with no other job year after year Greg?  Are we talking over 100K a year?
      </p>
      <p>
       It is amazing to me you are making so much money.  Maybe I should start a podcast and quit my job and smoke weed and drink all day like you!   I'm sure I can find some tarot card readers who can communicate with Baphomet somewhere, or a guy who makes fake videos of the moon being a hologram, or someone who claims to be a necromancer somewhere..

       Dude, I don't know what to say to you. Obviously you don't like me, and there's really not much I can do to change that.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's whatever, but I really am a guy who was overworked and stuck in a dead end career in a low paying industry. Walk through the whole THC archive. It's obvious, and all public. It sucked, and a lot of years were pretty awful. I made the choice to be poor in San Diego, rather than a homeowner in Missouri. I'm doing better that I was, but I still live in a one bedroom apartment and podcast from the foot of the bed. I love this city though. Rent is high, but the outdoors are free. It's a balance.
      </p>
      <p>
       I always wanted to be some form of entertainer. That's what I consider myself more than a truther/journalist. Disapprove of that if you want to. The point is, I am as surprised by the success as anyone and I'm quite proud of my ability to get here and the show I put together. Being asked to do something like this AMA really is one of those personal milestones that I'm pretty siked about, and it's disappointing that you are just trying to take it over with your campaign against me.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you're going to come after someone's integrity, you had better be impeccably factual in your claims. You've misrepresented me, selectively reworded what I've said, omitted key points to create doubt that isn't really there, completely over-embellished on my guests, made accusations about me and my dad, and been completely disingenuous. I think I demonstrated that responding to another post. So if you really think I'm that deceptive, you aren't any better. I'm not your enemy man, but I got to start ignoring you.

       Come on, the guy barely asks for money and provides a ton of content very cheaply (on top of providing a ton of content for free). There are real hucksters in the conspiracy world, just like in every community, but Carlwood isn't one of them.

       Seriously, Greg works really hard and deserves being able to make a living doing what he loves. For years, he was bringing content that no one else was giving the world. It's a slice of modern culture that needs to be documented and Greg had the foresight to see the importance of it and put everything on the line to record. It inspired others to do the same. Paying for plus is a no brainer.

       I listen to THC all the time. Great show and Greg is a terrific interviewer. If you like the show I highly encourage getting the plus membership. The extra hour truly is worth it for only $5 a month. That's basically a dollar for every hour of extra content per month.

       What did you make of his interview with Judy Wood? That is where he lost me. Within just a few minutes Wood had already contradicted herself, blatantly, and Carl just let her keep on spouting her utter nonsense. How could any sane man listen to that and think Greg truly cares about the truth?

       I'm not a.huge Judy wood fan, I don't believe her theories on 9/11, seem way too fantastical. But you're just bringing up one show in hundreds. So what Greg wasn't on the ball that day? Are we perfect everyday? But if you listen to 99% of his co tent he keeps his guests in track and his audience engaged. Greg is alright in my book.

       9/11 is a vitally important topic, and Judy Wood is a significant character within the broader disinfo network. Greg's interview with 'UFOlogists' (lol) and other bigfoot-tier clowns are irrelevant, trivial amusements for lost minds. His interview with Wood was a chance to establish himself as a genuine thinker, and he blew it. Massively so.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was a real shame because he comes across as a very likeable guy.

       There are far more important people in the truther movement than Judy Wood. She is the Steven Greer of 9/11 conspiracy. Shes claiming advanced super tech destroyed the towers. Ok cool theory. But what about the mossad art student team that had free reign of the towers in the days leading up to it? Or the witness reports if hearing explosions in the basements? Or the firefighters reporting molten metals
       <em>
        days
       </em>
       after the towers fell? All evidence points to explosives being planted, sonic weapons or mini bikes.
      </p>
      <p>
       We all know 9/11 was a false flag. I hope one day we can figure out exactly what happened and hopefully the UAS collapse report will shed a little more light into it. At least how 7 went down but maybe that's all we need to get a new investigation started.

       If you have that much of a problem with Greg over one episode then you either haven't listened to the show much or you're just trying to shit on him. Sure he has some guests who are on the "fringe" but I would saw 7/10 shows are great content that makes you think while the other 3 shows are for entertainment more than anything.

       The boxes in the background of those photos, at best, suggest that they contained a fuse housing. Who knows what the item code BB 18 meant in 2000. There could have been any number of things held in those boxes, which were used as walls to construct what was basically a fort.

       Even if it were the fuse holders, that would have nothing to do with detonating any sort of demolition charge. That particular device is used to keep people and objects from actually touching a fuse. Not sure how you'd detonate a an explosive or thermite charge using one

       I would argue that anyone who dislikes Judy Wood hasn't read her book. I've read about a book a week for 5 years because of the show, and her's is a goddamn college textbook. Definitely in the top 5% in terms of academic quality.It's full of well laid out data and plenty of color photos that make her case better than an interview does. Just my two cents.

       You are quite right. I will try to put something together and post it here soon. For a start, listen to when she is talking at the start of the interview about the process of analysis. Then consider where she got her images.

       Is the implication that the government or some other organization edited the images she uses?  Because that would just be further evidence of a conspiracy.  Or are you implying

       Ugh, I knew who left this comment before I even looked at the name! My #1 troll Paulstal Service. I actually shared the first couple YouTube videos he made about me because I thought it was hilarious to have someone paint me as so mysterious and deceptive.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's laughable to say I interview "almost exclusively Freemasons." In fact, one of my closing cover/parody songs is a rendition of Ace of Base's "I  Saw The Sign" that talks about Freemason's sacrificing kids in the moonlight. Not something they really like hearing. I interview maybe 1-5 guests a year with some aspect of Freemasonic history. It's just par for the course in this realm. As long as it's disclosed up front, listeners are free to adjust their credibility scales accordingly. Personally, I think someone like Randall Carlson, for example, is a great dude. Also a Freemason.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the Freemason emblem on my car, nobody would know about that if I didn't freely bring it up on my own show. If I was some secret Freemasonic agent, do you think you'd be cracking the case by seeing a sticker on my car? The reason it's there is pretty easy to explain: I'm a control system averse stoner, with a long history of getting pulled over and having my day ruined. I spent $8 on Amazon to see if projecting a slightly different image would help with that. It has. Coincidence or not, I have not been pulled over since. I also just get a kick out of subverting things like that. I think that's easy to understand.
      </p>
      <p>
       If there are cheap and easy ways to get an edge in the big game that doesn't hurt anyone, I say give it a try. Why not buy a little local neighborhood privilege for $7.99? I recommend you all get your own, until it loses it's power entirely:

       Freemasons sacrificing people by the moonlight- Unless you are one, how would you know whether or not they think that song is funny? As you may not be aware Greg, the elite get off on telling us exactly what they are doing to us.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regarding "disclosing" who is and is not connected to Freemasonry, only after having researched some of the guests you've had on did I discover they were connected, and it was not disclosed in the conversation.   Tracy Twyman is a perfect example, I do a little bit of digging into her, and for lack of a better term, she's a psycho, and she's seen in pictures wearing a long Freemasonic necklace..  Where do you find these people Greg?
      </p>
      <p>
       You call yourself a "conspiracy theorist talent scout" but I have a feeling you just work as part of a network inter-promoting sketchy characters like Crow777-
      </p>
      <p>
       Hey, curious Greg, after I exposed Crow777's fake lunar wave, did you disassociate yourself from him? Or are you still plugging his nonsense?
      </p>
      <p>
       You've had multiple flat-earth people on, you hardly ever question them, and you don't have any non-flat earth people on, like myself.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, for someone you are calling a troll, you did invite me to come on your program. Guess you have rather low standards if you're inviting "trolls" on your show Greg.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, you didn't admit you had the freemasonic bumper sticker until after I did a video showing all your symbolism, the people you're having on your program, and other aspects, and I openly questioned your relationship to the organization.
      </p>
      <p>
       You then replied to what I had written, admitting you have a freemasonic bumper stick on your and your girlfriend's car, and you do it to "avoid traffic tickets".
      </p>
      <p>
       I wasn't born yesterday Greg.
      </p>
      <p>
       Oh, and did I hear you promote known Satanist Duncan Trussell in a few shows recently?  It goes on and on Greg.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your father- Was he, or was he not a Freemason, Greg?
      </p>
      <p>
       It's interesting

       ...All the criminals and monsters in the world, and I'm your focus.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look, I obviously can't keep responding to you. That's the trap, but now I'm going to respond to you once more anyway. Just a couple things:
      </p>
      <p>
       -After your first 2 videos painting me to be some connected agent, I did invite you on THC. I thought it would be a unique show, because I think your claims are so ridiculous. However, when you didn't take my offer to have a discussion about your suspicions with me, but instead kept making videos about me, I thought that was poor etiquette.
      </p>
      <p>
       -It also stopped being funny to me when it wasn't just statements like:
      </p>
      <p>
       "Maybe he's connected, his show is too polished for one guy." and 
"A true stoner couldn't put this show together, he must not really smoke." (Amazing compliments by the way.)
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem was when you just started lying and twisting things I freely volunteered to make them look more sketchy than they really are. 3 examples above from just your post above:
      </p>
      <p>
       "you don't have any non-flat earth people on" ....Clearly not true. I can't control everything a guest says, but as for shows focused on the idea of Flat Earth, there are only really three: Eric Dubay, Jeran Campanella, and Marty Leeds. I've done hundreds of other shows and have said several times that I'm not convinced the Earth is flat.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another point about that, I don't ever try to tell anyone what to think. My show is about finding interesting researchers who I think make the best case for various alternative perspectives. Sometimes they make you think, sometimes they don't make the sale and their perspective falls flat. It's more about exploring fringe ideas we don't get from the mainstream. To explore them, rather than have the media gatekeepers just dismiss them on our behalf. Ultimately, to find our individual true norths.
      </p>
      <p>
       So I don't feel any responsibility other than to help a guest make their case as methodically as we can, and hopefully listeners mine some gems out of that for themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       "you didn't admit you had the freemasonic bumper sticker until after I did a video showing all your symbolism, the people you're having on your program, and other aspects, and I openly questioned your relationship to the organization."....You use "admit" like you cornered me or something. I made several Facebook posts about it when it was just an idea for a goof. Did you ever consider that? Sure, you made a video suggesting I was a mason, but 99% of my audience didn't see that. I freely decided to talk about it in a wrap up because it was so ridiculous to me. The tone of your video makes me seem like a villain, I got a laugh out of that.
      </p>
      <p>
       "You then replied to what I had written, admitting you have put freemasonic bumper stickers on your and your girlfriend's cars, and you do it to "avoid traffic tickets". You said if they gave you a hard time you would just mention your father.. I'm assuming he's a known mason in the San Diego area." ....This is the kind of thing where I do start to get a little pissed off, because you clearly heard the clip where I talked about this, and you're selectively picking things out to twist it around.
      </p>
      <p>
       The context was that someone had asked me, "Well what happens if a cop pulls you over, references the emblem, and then wants to get the secret handshake?" and I responded that I already considered that, and said that if I was pulled over and it was referenced, I would say, "Oh, I don't know a ton about that. My dad put it on my car, and just told me I needed to keep it there." Which I think is a pretty great rebuttal for that situation, and has nothing to do with my actual father, because again, I bought it on fucking Amazon for fun.
      </p>
      <p>
       You take that story, and then make a huge assumption about my father, who you know nothing about, and has never lived in San Diego. Just fuck off man. Go after someone more nefarious, there's no shortage of them.

       Don't flatter yourself Greg, I make videos on all sorts of sketchy shills attempting to hijack and run the Truth Movement.  You just appear to be another sellout in a long line of them.  I don't believe you are a one-man show, I find your insistence on e-mailing you very bizarre. -IP collection most likely.
      </p>
      <p>
       After I made a video on you, you responded, and admitted you have a freemasonic bumper sticker on your car and I'm the bad guy for pointing this out in a follow up video? That's something most real Truthers do not find funny Greg.  I really haven't gone into depth on all the sketch-guests you have on all the time, I could make video after video on that.  I would say 80% of the guests you have on fall into the "very sketchy" category.
      </p>
      <p>
       If it's not a guy faking a lunar wave video, it's a guy talking about fallen angels, flat earth, archons, shapeshifters, the "blinking universe", communicating with Baphomet via ouija board.. I mean the list goes on and on.
      </p>
      <p>
       You still won't respond to your "relationship" to known disinformation artist Crow777 - a person who was creating fake videos of a "lunar wave" you had on your show I believe multiple times, and why is it you're plugging Duncan Trussell (satanist) all the time again?  Is this your crew Greg?
      </p>
      <p>
       Your shown consistently has sketchy characters on it, many of whom make money selling conspiracy for a living via books or talks, and many are admitted masons (some not admitted but when looking deeper turn out to be connected to masonry) if not satanists/occultists.
      </p>
      <p>
       You admit you "do very well for yourself" - you would have to support a heavy weed habit and expensive San Diego rents, not to mention the ever climbing cost for food and everything.  But life seems pretty easy for ya!
      </p>
      <p>
       Regarding me "forcing you" to respond- you have your own free will man, I am not making you do anything.  Do what thou wilt Greg ;) I'm not forcing you to do anything. I just do not trust you and I want other people to understand you're bad news for the truth movement and are likely a talent agent not for "conspiracy theorists" but are promoting a network of people with malicious intentions toward all "Truthers".

       It's staggering to think that anyone who has listened to your show could doubt your integrity or suggest that you have some kind of sinister agenda. Whether it's shining a light on the nefarious practices of the elites or squeegeeing the third eye clean of the materialist construct your show always manages to both entertain and inform. As a fan of Terrance McKenna, Graham Hancock, Gordon White, Hollow Earth etc, The Higherside Chats is mana from heaven - looking forward to the AMA!

       Greg, I listen to all the wacky stuff, but I certainly have a critical ear. I think our approaches are similar, but not the same. Here's my main critique/peeve with THC:
      </p>
      <p>
       You give a lot of airtime to views which would normally never see the light of day, and for that I applaud you. HOWEVER. However, in my informed opinion, you've had on several sales people interested in pushing a known falsehood. At the top of this list is Dr. Judy Wood. Now, let's not throw all her work out with the bathwater. The reason she originally made a name for herself is because of
       <a href="https://ixquick-proxy.com/do/spg/show_picture.pl?l=english&amp;amp;rais=1&amp;amp;oiu=http%3A%2F%2Fdrjudywood.com%2Farticles%2FBBE%2FBBEpics%2FWTC-A3-150.jpg&amp;amp;sp=320fcc907a7885a6392d77d8c8c20a8e">
        the chart
       </a>
       she produced which showed that "progressive collapse" would have to have taken much longer than the 9 and 11 seconds they officially did. In this analysis she says some very reasonable things:

        The August Fact Sheet (Answers to Frequently Asked Questions) by NIST states, "NIST estimated the elapsed times for the first exterior panels to strike the ground after the collapse initiated in each of the towers to be approximately 11 seconds for WTC 1 and approximately 9 seconds for WTC 2." (Question #6.) The height of the South Tower (WTC2) is 1362 feet, and the height of the North Tower (WTC1) is 1368 feet, which are nearly the same. Do these values seem reasonable? Let's calculate a few values we can use as a reference.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Sounds very reasonable to me. And her very reasonable argument continues:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Let's say I tell you that I ran, by foot,
to a store (10 miles away), then
to the bank (5 more miles), then
to the dog track (7 more miles), then
to my friend's house (21 more miles), then home ...all in 2 minutes.
To disprove your story, I could present to you a simple case. I would present to you that the world's record for running just one mile is 3:43.13, or just under four minutes.  So, it does not seem possible that I could have run over 40 miles in 2 minutes.  i.e. It does not seem possible for me to have run 43 miles in half the time it would take the holder of the world's record to run just one mile.  Even if you gave me the benefit of having run all 43 miles at world-record pace, it would not have been possible for me to have covered that distance in two minutes.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Well said, Dr. Wood. It's actually a great argument which absolutely cements the death of the official story. It simply couldn't have happened the way it was sold to us, and for that, I laud Dr. Wood's work.
      </p>
      <p>
       That was about 2005-6. Shortly after her work made a serious impact on people like me, she changed her tune--and most importantly, her thorough academic approach was replaced by "feelings" and innuendo and still photographs which she purported were the smoking guns of some secret death-ray technology.
      </p>
      <p>
       Her approach, her arguments and her tack all took a sharp turn towards the purposefully uninformed, which is to say, she's protecting the people who sank the towers. Now, I don't expect you to call her out on this explicitly. That's not your style, and I wouldn't blame a fish for drinking water. At the same time, you could ask her why she doesn't apply the same simple but powerful logic of her original work to the DEW evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       To be clear, I'm all for giving a voice to some outlandish ideas. I want to hear the most unconventional thoughts that humans can produce. But a teaspoon of critical thought can make all the difference between introducing a truly revolutionary idea into the public consciousness and allowing a sales pitch which has the effect of covering the tracks of contract murderers.
      </p>
      <p>
       I hope this meets you with reason and sincerity. And know I'm listening for the revolutionary thoughts....

       A lot of the technical aspects of her work require an expertise I don't have, but this is what I would say in her defense, because I do think her work is pretty incredible.
      </p>
      <p>
       -Most critics have not held her book in their hands. If you spent a few hours with it, I just don't know how you couldn't be impressed. It's the most detailed, methodical, academic book I've read on almost anything. I don't know if it's 100% accurate, but goddamn is it a good case. 
-Because of all the hate  she's taken, she basically stopped doing interviews. I pretty much had to beg, and only because a fellow colleague of her's was familiar with the show and vouched that I had good intentions did it actually happen. 
-Also, she gave me a written quiz about the book, to prove I'd actually read it and understood it, before she'd agree to the show. I point this out because she really fucking cares. It's not about selling a book to her or she'd have made it way more approachable. It's a textbook, like I mentioned before. It's expensive not because of greed, but because of the hi-res color photos all throughout the massive thing.
-It's funny you use the term "some secret death-ray technology." because in the interview I think she even said that it's that sort of dismissive tone that misrepresents her work. I think "death-ray" is a little dismissive and disingenuous, isn't it?  I don't think that's exactly what she says, and probably walks the line of misrepresentation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Personally, I think if you get the book, she walks you through the various data of several controlled demolitions. Then, she walks you through the data of the World Trade Center complex, and it's categorically different. The most impressive to me, (though I haven't vetted that the data she uses isn't fabricated, I did take her word for it) is the Seismic data. The hundreds of tons of debris should have crashed into the cement water table  under the complex there, and destroyed it. With it, should have come verifiable and standard seismic data about the force of that impact. The reality as I understand it, is that there was nearly no impact. This is why she says the buildings were "dustified," and I think she has a point.
      </p>
      <p>
       She also focuses on a particular set of video frames that show a spire on one of the towers. As it collapses, the tower basically disintegrates. Why would that happen from a plane impact, or explosives below?
      </p>
      <p>
       Stoner science explanation alert, but she basically proposes some type of field weapon. As if a radiation field was set up, and then a second type of wave was introduced, to break things down on a molecular level. This would be some secret deep state tech for sure, but I think it's in the realm of possibility.
      </p>
      <p>
       She then goes into the various reports from people in the areas and survivors that include bizarre details, like looking up from inside and seeing sky, rather than being crushed, that actually fit into this new context.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, the science to show that the heat of these fields becomes like a microwave, and people weren't deciding to jump to their death because of bombs or fires, but because they were trying to escape the "cooking" for lack of a better term. Apparently wrapping wet towels around yourself, because you think there's a fire and you don't really know what's going on, would make this 10x worse. Dark, but I always did find those jumpers to be a little odd for the situation. Just an opinion.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you listen to the researchers talking about the dangers of the 5G roll out, it's basically the technology that was field tested on 9/11, or matches up with it quite well to my simple mind.
      </p>
      <p>
       Throughout this I've avoided saying she's 100% right, because I don't know, but if you read her book and let her make her complete case, I think you'd find it more credible. It's too complex to really judge accurately, unless a person does that. If you aren't convinced by the physical book, or maybe a presentation she's done with slides, then I suppose that's all I can say about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       All that said, her perspective is where I'd put my money, but I do think we sometimes get hung up on details that don't functionally change the story: 9/11 was a false flag. I think it, you think it, Judy Wood thinks it- we should be on the same team....and if we can't unite around that, it's like we don't ever get past ourselves enough to even get to the real criminals. Crabs in a bucket, pulling each other down.

       High-power HF heating experiments have been conducted at HAARP in October 2008 and August 2011 in conjunction with the CHAMP and twin GRACE satellites carrying the STAR and SuperSTAR accelerometers, respectively. These experiments presented the first evidence of F2-region atmospheric gravity waves generated by HF heating. These results provide the groundwork for a new method of studying the ionosphere-thermosphere coupling.

       Hurricane Erin is covered in Chapter 18 (pages 395-412) of WHERE DID THE TOWERS GO? by Dr. Judy Wood.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is the introduction to the chapter:
      </p>
      <p>
       "It was a beautiful early-autumn morning in New York City. September 11, 2001, started out calm, with pleasant temperatures and crystalline blue skies. Some had taken time to do early morning errands. But very few of those people, in fact very few among the entire population of New York City, knew that a massive hurricane was located at that very same time just off the shore of Long Island. That storm was Hurricane Erin, as seen in Figure 411:"
      </p>
      <p>
       Why was Hurricane Erin traveling straight for NYC from September 3rd-11th 2001, yet it was not reported on by any major media broadcast in that area? Most people are totally unaware that Hurricane Erin came closest to New York City and reached its largest size on 9/11. Hurricane Erin was slightly larger than Hurricane Katrina (i.e. Kinetic Energy as measured by Accumulated Cyclone Energy Index*), and hurricanes rarely head straight for NYC, so why wasn't it reported on by any major corporate media station? Furthermore, why was Hurricane Erin still not reported on when it reached its closest point to NYC on the morning of September 11th, just before it diverted from its straight-line trajectory by suddenly turning and heading out to sea? How were meteorologists absolutely certain that this hurricane would make a sharp right-hand turn away from New York City? Not only is New York City near sea level, but so is most of Long Island. Evacuation from those areas would be a mammoth undertaking and could not be organized at a moment's notice and yet the public remained uninformed. The data shows that Erin slowed down as it approached New York City and then remained almost stationary during the morning of 9/11. Immediately after the World Trade Center complex was attacked, Erin began to move away from New York City. Coincidentally, Hurricane Erin was studied more than any other hurricane had been studied before, and more was learned from it than had been learned from any hurricane before it.

       A Heated 3-D Look Into Erin's Eye
      </p>
      <p>
       Hurricane Erin raced across the North Atlantic and along the eastern seaboard in September 2001. She was used as an experiment for a study to improve hurricane tracking and intensity predictions, allowing meteorologists to provide more accurate and timely warnings to the public. Studies show that temperatures measured at an extremely high altitude collected from a hurricane's center or eye can provide improved understanding of how hurricanes change intensity.
      </p>
      <p>
       The mission originated from the Naval Air Station in Jacksonville, Fla. The mission united researchers from 10 universities, five NASA centers and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. CAMEX-4 is a series of field research investigations to study tropical cyclones â storms commonly known as hurricanes.

       *The accumulated cyclone energy index (ACE) for Hurricane Erin was HIGHER than the ACE index for Hurricane Katrina. This subject is covered in Chapter 18, section E, page 405 of WHERE DID THE TOWERS GO?
      </p>
      <p>
       Accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) is a measure used by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to express the activity of individual tropical cyclones and entire tropical cyclone seasons, particularly the North Atlantic hurricane season. It uses an approximation of the energy used by a tropical system over its lifetime and is calculated every six-hour period. Kinetic energy is proportional to the square of velocity, and by adding together the energy per some interval of time, the accumulated energy is found. As the duration of a storm increases, more values are summed and the ACE also increases such that longer-duration storms may accumulate a larger ACE than more-powerful storms of lesser duration.

      <p>
       Greg! First of all, thanks for replying. You've got a box full of questions; i appreciate your time.
      </p>
      <p>
       Second, am I being dismissive by calling it a "death ray"? Yes. Yes I am. And I'll walk that back for this discussion. I have not read her book, however, I watched her entire
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ML8CJp9Ha14">
        yt presentation
       </a>
       of her book
       <em>
        Where Did The Towers Go?
       </em>
       . My criticisms are of her arguments and evidence, which she goes into thoroughly in that presentation.
      </p>
      <p>
       I see techniques on her part that convey a kind of slight-of-hand. For instance, she shows a still photo of the collapse and says "do you see the dust being squirted into the air? Why didn't anyone see this?" That to me is a deceptive tactic provided to enhance a very narrow interpretation of events. Why not show the video of that still photo--even if only for 5 seconds on either side of it? In other words, how could a photo depict "upward squirting" of materials better than a video of the same perspective? The simple answer is it can't.
      </p>
      <p>
       That leaves two explanations for that tactic: deception. Or, if I remove any bad intent, poor argumentation. But Dr. Wood has shown she is capable of good argumentation. Not only is she good at it, she's a real educator. Like the argument she uses to demonstrate how progressive collapse was impossible: she uses analogies that demonstrate the scope and power of her arguments. But not in this case.
      </p>
      <p>
       In this case, she uses a photograph, aka, a slice of time, to claim that a process is happening--a process which we cannot infer from a single photograph. Again, this has a strong appearance of deception. If the evidence was so strong, why is she asking us to reinterpret a sequence of events from a single photograph? That's not science. That's salesmanship.
      </p>
      <p>
       In regard to being dismissive, she lists the competing theories:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        fire
       </li>
       <li>
        thermite (welding materials)
       </li>
       <li>
        dynamite (bombs)
       </li>
       <li>
        nukes (big nuke)
       </li>
       <li>
        mini nukes (little nuke)
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Now, on that list there are two contender theories which have large bodies of evidence to draw from: conventional bombs and some kind of thermite. I ask you Greg, is she being dismissive in those cases to list them as "dynamite (bombs)" and "thermite (welding materials)"? It certainly seems so to me. Why not be scientific about it (as opposed to pursuasive)? Why is it more important that people believe her theory as opposed to getting to the actual truth of the matter?
      </p>
      <p>
       She might say she is trying to get to the truth, but then why the attempt to associate thermite with "welding materials" and bombs with "dynamite"? That speaks volumes about her willingness to entertain the competing theories. The implication is that these theories are based on old technology--nothing capable of destroying the buildings.
      </p>
      <p>
       To be fair, conventional thermite has been traditionally used as a welding material. This is a well-known, uncontroversial fact. But the claims of Jones, Harrit, et. al. is not that conventional thermite was used, but that a military-grade thermal bridge was used which appears to be a highly engineered concoction designed to employ a combination of heat and pressure to remove steel. So if she's not trying to simply be persuasive, why isn't she presenting the strongest case for these competitors? That's what the scientific method (and academic honesty) require. That's how we avoid accusations of straw men. Again, this is dismissive on her part and has the tinge of deception about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, she uses still photos to make the case that the building "turned to dust". And asks "do you know anything that could turn a building to dust?" That's a lot of conjecture on her part based
       <em>
        solely
       </em>
       on still photos and her accompanying interpretation--i.e., that they are "turning to dust" in front of us. This is her basis for "dustification"--a term which she uses quite liberally, but never defines operationally. I get what she's talking about, but where is the lab demonstration of "dustification"? It doesn't exist. You ever wonder why? It's pivotal to her entire supposition, yet, there's no controlled science out there which shows any electromagetic field that can dissociate steel--not even a small amount of it.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is not a trivial point. It is the essence of what's wrong with Dr. Wood's hypothesis (or implication, or whatever framework you want to use). The problem is the amount of energy it takes to break the bonds of structural steel. There isn't enough of it. Ultimately, the DEW concept requires a lot of energy. I'm not a physicist, but I work with nuclear isotopes, so I'm familiar with energy calculations in other contexts.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I can tell you is that energy is not free. It must come from somewhere. There is a known amount of energy necessary to break the bonds of structural steel--or any material for that matter. Before any lab tests are done, one can do calculations with pencil and paper to see the feasibility of a lab test. By doing so, one can determine if there's any substance to the idea of the DEW without expending anything except time and brain power.
      </p>
      <p>
       In essence, Dr. Wood is proposing an energy transfer device. This device is theorized to have broken the bonds of the components of the WTC buildings (though nowhere is Dr. Wood as explicit as I'm being--as if she's simply suggesting this implicitly so as not to get called out on the specifics of it). And we are left to assume that "dustification" is the chemical by-product of this reaction. (If this isn't the case, then for the life of me, I have no idea what she's proposing.) So that's where I'm starting. It's also where Dr. Wood should start, but strangely, she never not once mentions an energy calculation necessary to dissociate steel or anything else. Why not?
      </p>
      <p>
       As a scientist or engineer or critical thinking of any stripe, a paper and pencil calculation is
       <strong>
        first
       </strong>
       low-cost feasibility study that would be done. Period. I have a hard time believing Dr. Wood accidentally overlooked this. She's many things, but not stupid. That's my problem with her--not that she's a nut case. That's dismissive and not how I see her. This would be much less disconcerting if she was indeed a sloppy thinker. That's the difference between simply wrong or unfounded and being deceptive, with intent to deceive.
      </p>
      <p>

       <em>
        All the other parts of her argument are irrelevant to the primary question of the thermodynamics: how much energy (at a minimum) would it take to do the destruction we witnessed? *

       By side-stepping this issue in favor of making up new terms for things we already have names for is, technically speaking, a kind of argument from ignorance. Basically she says "we can't call these effects names we already have because we've never seen them before." But how do we know that? Have we really ruled out the possibility that we saw rapid oxidation effects? No, we haven't. In fact, the "nanothermite" explanation goes potentially all the way in explaining these effects. Instead of attempting to explain the phenomena in known scientific terms, she opts to make up new terms ex nihilo: "dustification," "lather," what explanatory purpose do these serve that are not better served by known processes like "oxidation" or "billowing smoke"? She proposes this is something we've never seen before, but what she really means is "this is a combination of by-products we've never seen at this scale."
      </p>
      <p>
       Pointing at video clips and photos and telling me what I should be seeing is not a scientific conclusion reached from a scientific process. That's simply and unarguably an attempt to re-tell the history of what happened by virtue of selective reinterpretation.
      </p>
      <p>
       The video of "pieces turning to dust in the air" is about as scientific as a carnival barker explaining the bake-o-matic 6000. And she points to another photo of where those pieces supposedly fell, and tells us she knows what those people were thinking. She even has a special name for that photograph. She calls it "the twilight zone" because it looks like these people were in the twilight zone. That's a neat interpretation, but it ain't science. It's hardly an argument. But it's part of her presentation. Why? Why can't I just see the lab demonstration? Or a calculation?
      </p>
      <p>
       (Nothing magical happened that day. On this we should all agree. Not to say this event didn't consolidate massive power and money for a handful of people around the world. That's exactly what happened. Fortunes were guaranteed for many generations on that day, without doubt. Whatever crazy demons they may or may not have sacrificed to is irrelevant to me, at least. It is the power and the money to which we answer in this world.)
      </p>
      <p>
       Under her definition of "dustification" the "squibs" or rapid gas expansion seen ahead of the collapse fronts gets subsumed as "dusitification," this phenomenon which has not (to my knowledge) been replicated in the lab on steel using any combination of EM fields. That's convenient, but does this re-definition of this event move us forward to an explanation? How does it make this event make
       <em>
        more
       </em>
       sense? If we can't get past the basic energy problem, then we're just counting griffins. It's not helping. It's obfuscatory. A smokescreen. Why?
      </p>
      <p>
       Because it obviates the need for explosives. All the things we think are rapid gas expansion are just more dustification. Witness testimony? All of them were "Scott tanks". Ok, she's wiped her hands of a need to explain evidence for explosives.
      </p>
      <p>
       The rest of her "evidence" amounts to her saying "just let the evidence tell you what's going on..."
       <em>
        as
       </em>
       she's telling her audience how to interpret what we're seeing. That's about 50% of her shtick.
      </p>
      <p>
       Greg, I'm not a scientist but I am in a scientific field. And I've studied metatheory to a fair degree to say I have some competence. Her theory is not scientific because it doesn't even attempt the most basic test of feasibility: how much energy does it take to do x? The rest is clearly some jangly keys. DEW. Death ray. Whatever parlance suits you.
      </p>
      <p>
       Take care, my friend.

       Popular theories about what destroyed the World Trade Center towers on September 11, 2001 are:
      </p>
      <p>
       1 Fires from jet fuel and office materials weakened steel in the upper floors and the buildings collapsed
      </p>
      <p>
       2 Conventional controlled demolition blew out supports at the base and the buildings collapsed
      </p>
      <p>
       3 Thermite cut steel columns on virtually every floor and the buildings collapsed
      </p>
      <p>
       4 Conventional explosives blew the buildings up
      </p>
      <p>
       5 Mini-nukes blew the buildings up
      </p>
      <p>
       Theories 1, 2 and 3 rely on gravity to bring the buildings down while the last two blow them up. Popular theories, yes, and dead wrong.
Five facts scientifically documented in Ph.D. engineer Judy Woodâs comprehensive textbook (Where Did The Towers Go?) prove the popular theories false beyond any doubt whatsoever. Yes, I know itâs amazing. Whoâd a thunk itâd be this easy?
      </p>
      <p>
       THE FACTS:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         DEBRIS: What debris? There was so little debris from each 110-story building that there was no âpileâ or âstack.â Rubble totaled less than a story. It was a football field as a survivor who emerged from Stairwell B, North Tower, exclaimed. No computers, toilets, and only one small piece from one Steelcase file cabinet were found. Some steel and mostly dust remained. Lack of debris on the ground from quarter-mile-high twin towers whispers âno collapse.â See Chapter 9.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         BATHTUB: A bathtub or slurry wall surrounded 70 feet of WTC subbasements to prevent the Hudson River from flooding the WTC and downtown. If each 500,000-ton tower had slammed into the bathtub in 10 seconds or less, the protective wall would collapse. Did not happen. Upshot? Collapses did not happen. See Chapter 5.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         SEISMIC IMPACT: âHad the towers collapsed, foundation bedrock would have experienced tremendous force hammering on it throughout the âcollapse,ââ writes Dr. Wood. Seismic instruments registered disturbances far too short in duration and far too small to record tower collapses. This was true of both the twin towers and 47-story WTC7. Again, no evidence of collapses. See Chapter 6.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         SOUND: There were no loud explosions, as established by videos, witnesses, and the official report of NIST. Nor were there loud screeches and screams from massive metal falling, colliding, scraping and collapsing on metal. See Chapter 6.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         DUST: Photos, videos and witness testimony show the towers turned to powder in mid-air. Tim McGinn, NYPD, said, âI was standing there for a couple of seconds thinking where the f**k is the tower? I simply couldnât comprehend it.â The dust rollout was so enormous and thick it blocked out sunlight and left an inch or more of dust covering downtown. Much of it wafted into the upper atmosphere. The volume was incredible. Particles from dust samples were smaller than red blood cells and about the size of DNA. As for toxicity, researchers said the dust ârecorded the highest levels we have ever seen in over 7,000 measurements we have made of very fine air pollution throughout the world, including Kuwait and China.â See Chapters 8, 9, 14-16.

       If your theory posits the existence of an energy weapon, why can't Dr. Wood produce an energy calculation? It's cheap cheap cheap to do. Just a calculator and a brain. Dr. Wood is smart enough to do it. Why doesn't she? Or you or anyone?
      </p>
      <p>
       She says something like "we don't know what kind of energy weapon did the destruction, so we can't calculate the energy required." This is bullshit. Anyone with a basic understanding of physics knows that you can do an equation of the
       <em>
        minimum
       </em>
       amount of energy required to break the bonds of a compound--in this case, steel and concrete--without have knowledge of a particular method of doing so. IOW, it's not necessary to know all the details of a DEW machine in order to the math.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you can't get past this essential calculation, the theory is certainly for shit. All the rest of the considerations are window dressing. Counting unicorns isn't productive if there's no such thing as unicorns.

       Massive fan of the show Greg.
      </p>
      <p>
       May I ask : Have you had any guests you would not have back when reviewing their work in hindsight?
      </p>
      <p>
       There are only a handful but ones that claim to have scientific studies to back up thier work but fail to mention self funded studies published in thier own, non recognised journals etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or maybe people that just cant add context to their statements.

       Thanks!

      <p>
       I definitely have had guests that I wouldn't want to bring back. Typically that has more to do with how the conversation goes, rather than the work I digested beforehand.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example, some researchers barely remember the details of their own book, or you get a lot of "I go into great detail in the book, I can't get into it here." That gets really annoying. Usually I try to have the bullet pointed facts myself so that I can follow up with some stuff if they try that too much. Obvious if you just want an entire episode of my show just ot be a teaser for your book, rather than a conversation about it, that pisses me off.
      </p>
      <p>
       On the flip side, some of my favorite guests are hard to bring back. If they've only written one book or only focus on a single subject, it's hard to justify what we didn't get to in a first interview. Rick Simpson would be a great example of that. Amazing guest, but what more is there to say?

       And there is the frank response that makes you a legend Greg.  I don't expect to be granted a follow up response but on the off chance : Are there any subjects you just would not go near? And if so would you name them?

       No worries! I'm pretty much cool with any subject as long as I find it interesting. When you've done shows about the idea that the Holocaust was a hoax, the Flat Earth, and pedophilia networks, what's left to avoid?

I suppose it's not like we'd ever be able to retrieve the spacecraft, but the idea feels irresponsible and potentially nefarious to me as I learn more about what Saturn represents to humans through time. But I am a natural worrier and could be getting worked up about nothing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also do you have any thoughts on the idea of the Revelations prophecy kicking off September 23? And could the 'Pepe in the Sky' meme be some kind of psyop to discredit this idea?

       There is a very wide array of opinions on here, it's not a typical Reddit echo-chamber.  This holds true for all subjects of inquiry, with no exception for Greg. I've seen users accusing him of being a shill, a disinfo-agent, and opportunist and I'm sure he will face some of those suspicions tonight.

      <p>
       I just wanted to point out that leading up to this event, he has already answered to one of his detractors in this very thread.  So if you are wanting to probe his integrity or genuineness I would just ask that you look

       Huh. I like THC, particularly because he casts such a wide umbrella and finds people talking about theories I've never heard of.
      </p>
      <p>
       The weakest part of his show, though, is that he doesn't really interview people--he just lets them talk about their thing. And that's not a bad thing, obviously that's the point of the show. But compare him to someone like Howard Hughes on The Unexplained, and you see the difference between that style and a professional interviewer. Hughes asks questions that challenge his guests to go beyond the elevator pitch and their scripted spiel.

       High-power HF heating experiments have been conducted at HAARP in October 2008 and August 2011 in conjunction with the CHAMP and twin GRACE satellites carrying the STAR and SuperSTAR accelerometers, respectively. These experiments presented the first evidence of F2-region atmospheric gravity waves generated by HF heating. These results provide the groundwork for a new method of studying the ionosphere-thermosphere coupling.

       Hurricane Erin is covered in Chapter 18 (pages 395-412) of WHERE DID THE TOWERS GO? by Dr. Judy Wood.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is the introduction to the chapter:
      </p>
      <p>
       "It was a beautiful early-autumn morning in New York City. September 11, 2001, started out calm, with pleasant temperatures and crystalline blue skies. Some had taken time to do early morning errands. But very few of those people, in fact very few among the entire population of New York City, knew that a massive hurricane was located at that very same time just off the shore of Long Island. That storm was Hurricane Erin, as seen in Figure 411:"
      </p>
      <p>
       Why was Hurricane Erin traveling straight for NYC from September 3rd-11th 2001, yet it was not reported on by any major media broadcast in that area? Most people are totally unaware that Hurricane Erin came closest to New York City and reached its largest size on 9/11. Hurricane Erin was slightly larger than Hurricane Katrina (i.e. Kinetic Energy as measured by Accumulated Cyclone Energy Index*), and hurricanes rarely head straight for NYC, so why wasn't it reported on by any major corporate media station? Furthermore, why was Hurricane Erin still not reported on when it reached its closest point to NYC on the morning of September 11th, just before it diverted from its straight-line trajectory by suddenly turning and heading out to sea? How were meteorologists absolutely certain that this hurricane would make a sharp right-hand turn away from New York City? Not only is New York City near sea level, but so is most of Long Island. Evacuation from those areas would be a mammoth undertaking and could not be organized at a moment's notice and yet the public remained uninformed. The data shows that Erin slowed down as it approached New York City and then remained almost stationary during the morning of 9/11. Immediately after the World Trade Center complex was attacked, Erin began to move away from New York City. Coincidentally, Hurricane Erin was studied more than any other hurricane had been studied before, and more was learned from it than had been learned from any hurricane before it.

       A Heated 3-D Look Into Erin's Eye
      </p>
      <p>
       Hurricane Erin raced across the North Atlantic and along the eastern seaboard in September 2001. She was used as an experiment for a study to improve hurricane tracking and intensity predictions, allowing meteorologists to provide more accurate and timely warnings to the public. Studies show that temperatures measured at an extremely high altitude collected from a hurricane's center or eye can provide improved understanding of how hurricanes change intensity.
      </p>
      <p>
       The mission originated from the Naval Air Station in Jacksonville, Fla. The mission united researchers from 10 universities, five NASA centers and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. CAMEX-4 is a series of field research investigations to study tropical cyclones â storms commonly known as hurricanes.

       *The accumulated cyclone energy index (ACE) for Hurricane Erin was HIGHER than the ACE index for Hurricane Katrina. This subject is covered in Chapter 18, section E, page 405 of WHERE DID THE TOWERS GO?
      </p>
      <p>
       Accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) is a measure used by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to express the activity of individual tropical cyclones and entire tropical cyclone seasons, particularly the North Atlantic hurricane season. It uses an approximation of the energy used by a tropical system over its lifetime and is calculated every six-hour period. Kinetic energy is proportional to the square of velocity, and by adding together the energy per some interval of time, the accumulated energy is found. As the duration of a storm increases, more values are summed and the ACE also increases such that longer-duration storms may accumulate a larger ACE than more-powerful storms of lesser duration.

      <p>
       Greg! First of all, thanks for replying. You've got a box full of questions; i appreciate your time.
      </p>
      <p>
       Second, am I being dismissive by calling it a "death ray"? Yes. Yes I am. And I'll walk that back for this discussion. I have not read her book, however, I watched her entire
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ML8CJp9Ha14">
        yt presentation
       </a>
       of her book
       <em>
        Where Did The Towers Go?
       </em>
       . My criticisms are of her arguments and evidence, which she goes into thoroughly in that presentation.
      </p>
      <p>
       I see techniques on her part that convey a kind of slight-of-hand. For instance, she shows a still photo of the collapse and says "do you see the dust being squirted into the air? Why didn't anyone see this?" That to me is a deceptive tactic provided to enhance a very narrow interpretation of events. Why not show the video of that still photo--even if only for 5 seconds on either side of it? In other words, how could a photo depict "upward squirting" of materials better than a video of the same perspective? The simple answer is it can't.
      </p>
      <p>
       That leaves two explanations for that tactic: deception. Or, if I remove any bad intent, poor argumentation. But Dr. Wood has shown she is capable of good argumentation. Not only is she good at it, she's a real educator. Like the argument she uses to demonstrate how progressive collapse was impossible: she uses analogies that demonstrate the scope and power of her arguments. But not in this case.
      </p>
      <p>
       In this case, she uses a photograph, aka, a slice of time, to claim that a process is happening--a process which we cannot infer from a single photograph. Again, this has a strong appearance of deception. If the evidence was so strong, why is she asking us to reinterpret a sequence of events from a single photograph? That's not science. That's salesmanship.
      </p>
      <p>
       In regard to being dismissive, she lists the competing theories:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        fire
       </li>
       <li>
        thermite (welding materials)
       </li>
       <li>
        dynamite (bombs)
       </li>
       <li>
        nukes (big nuke)
       </li>
       <li>
        mini nukes (little nuke)
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Now, on that list there are two contender theories which have large bodies of evidence to draw from: conventional bombs and some kind of thermite. I ask you Greg, is she being dismissive in those cases to list them as "dynamite (bombs)" and "thermite (welding materials)"? It certainly seems so to me. Why not be scientific about it (as opposed to pursuasive)? Why is it more important that people believe her theory as opposed to getting to the actual truth of the matter?
      </p>
      <p>
       She might say she is trying to get to the truth, but then why the attempt to associate thermite with "welding materials" and bombs with "dynamite"? That speaks volumes about her willingness to entertain the competing theories. The implication is that these theories are based on old technology--nothing capable of destroying the buildings.
      </p>
      <p>
       To be fair, conventional thermite has been traditionally used as a welding material. This is a well-known, uncontroversial fact. But the claims of Jones, Harrit, et. al. is not that conventional thermite was used, but that a military-grade thermal bridge was used which appears to be a highly engineered concoction designed to employ a combination of heat and pressure to remove steel. So if she's not trying to simply be persuasive, why isn't she presenting the strongest case for these competitors? That's what the scientific method (and academic honesty) require. That's how we avoid accusations of straw men. Again, this is dismissive on her part and has the tinge of deception about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, she uses still photos to make the case that the building "turned to dust". And asks "do you know anything that could turn a building to dust?" That's a lot of conjecture on her part based
       <em>
        solely
       </em>
       on still photos and her accompanying interpretation--i.e., that they are "turning to dust" in front of us. This is her basis for "dustification"--a term which she uses quite liberally, but never defines operationally. I get what she's talking about, but where is the lab demonstration of "dustification"? It doesn't exist. You ever wonder why? It's pivotal to her entire supposition, yet, there's no controlled science out there which shows any electromagetic field that can dissociate steel--not even a small amount of it.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is not a trivial point. It is the essence of what's wrong with Dr. Wood's hypothesis (or implication, or whatever framework you want to use). The problem is the amount of energy it takes to break the bonds of structural steel. There isn't enough of it. Ultimately, the DEW concept requires a lot of energy. I'm not a physicist, but I work with nuclear isotopes, so I'm familiar with energy calculations in other contexts.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I can tell you is that energy is not free. It must come from somewhere. There is a known amount of energy necessary to break the bonds of structural steel--or any material for that matter. Before any lab tests are done, one can do calculations with pencil and paper to see the feasibility of a lab test. By doing so, one can determine if there's any substance to the idea of the DEW without expending anything except time and brain power.
      </p>
      <p>
       In essence, Dr. Wood is proposing an energy transfer device. This device is theorized to have broken the bonds of the components of the WTC buildings (though nowhere is Dr. Wood as explicit as I'm being--as if she's simply suggesting this implicitly so as not to get called out on the specifics of it). And we are left to assume that "dustification" is the chemical by-product of this reaction. (If this isn't the case, then for the life of me, I have no idea what she's proposing.) So that's where I'm starting. It's also where Dr. Wood should start, but strangely, she never not once mentions an energy calculation necessary to dissociate steel or anything else. Why not?
      </p>
      <p>
       As a scientist or engineer or critical thinking of any stripe, a paper and pencil calculation is
       <strong>
        first
       </strong>
       low-cost feasibility study that would be done. Period. I have a hard time believing Dr. Wood accidentally overlooked this. She's many things, but not stupid. That's my problem with her--not that she's a nut case. That's dismissive and not how I see her. This would be much less disconcerting if she was indeed a sloppy thinker. That's the difference between simply wrong or unfounded and being deceptive, with intent to deceive.
      </p>

        All the other parts of her argument are irrelevant to the primary question of the thermodynamics: how much energy (at a minimum) would it take to do the destruction we witnessed? *
