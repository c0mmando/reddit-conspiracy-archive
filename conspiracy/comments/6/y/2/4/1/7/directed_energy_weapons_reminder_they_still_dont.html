<p>What people is dismissing and avoiding is the technological capability to remotely disable and temporarily/permanently harm a target; regardless of his age, sex, political convictions or affiliations, incoming or anything else, and the consequences are terrible human rights violations, impunity and crimes against humanity, as this potential depends only on the kind of people that possess this technology, including potential terrorists (If Cuba has them, they might not be famous for their secret weapons, but even if they have them, others too). These weapons aren&#39;t new and they have trying all their attempts to obscure them with the &quot;harmless non-lethal weapons&quot; and brain fish people can&#39;t link these &quot;harmlessness&quot; to actual obscure and potential covert operations to drive a person insane or kill them in the process.</p>

<p>If you ever said they &quot;can&#39;t mess with you&quot; because you are &quot;very tough&quot; with your AR15 or AK, and ever wondered how they could &quot;break you&quot;... I have news for you, and they won&#39;t even have to knock on your doorstep or show their faces. While you are considering a political agenda or political extremism as a threat, the potential to &quot;don&#39;t even need ask you&quot; is being developed everyday, and isn&#39;t as simple and rustic as a speaker or LRAD directed to you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So OP puts together a post with a ton of links and solid info and you&#39;re going to say he looks dumb because of a fucking grammar error.</p>

<p>Below you say he&#39;s lying that english isn&#39;t his first language because his mistake is not one commonly made by foreigners (wtf?)</p>

<p>So how about you break down your extensive studies in foreign languages and point out why you don&#39;t think it&#39;s a mistake that any ESL speaker couldn&#39;t possible make. Please provide links and sources. Unless of course you&#39;re talking out of your ass....which you are.</p>
