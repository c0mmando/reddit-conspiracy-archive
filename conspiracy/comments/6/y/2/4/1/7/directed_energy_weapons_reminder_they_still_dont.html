       I saw this more on /r/"worldnews" than in here, so lets give it another round.
      </p>
      <p>
       What people is dismissing and avoiding is the technological capability to remotely disable and temporarily/permanently harm a target; regardless of his age, sex, political convictions or affiliations, incoming or anything else, and the consequences are terrible human rights violations, impunity and crimes against humanity, as this potential depends only on the kind of people that possess this technology, including potential terrorists (If Cuba has them, they might not be famous for their secret weapons, but even if they have them, others too). These weapons aren't new and they have trying all their attempts to obscure them with the "harmless non-lethal weapons" and brain fish people can't link these "harmlessness" to actual obscure and potential covert operations to drive a person insane or kill them in the process.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you ever said they "can't mess with you" because you are "very tough" with your AR15 or AK, and ever wondered how they could "break you"... I have news for you, and they won't even have to knock on your doorstep or show their faces. While you are considering a political agenda or political extremism as a threat, the potential to "don't even need ask you" is being developed everyday, and isn't as simple and rustic as a speaker or LRAD directed to you.

       So OP puts together a post with a ton of links and solid info and you're going to say he looks dumb because of a fucking grammar error.
      </p>
      <p>
       Below you say he's lying that english isn't his first language because his mistake is not one commonly made by foreigners (wtf?)
      </p>
      <p>
       So how about you break down your extensive studies in foreign languages and point out why you don't think it's a mistake that any ESL speaker couldn't possible make. Please provide links and sources. Unless of course you're talking out of your ass....which you are.

       Second, I have never, ever seen anyone but a stupid racist say "I seen."  It's a really dumb mistake to make and while I get that OP knows how to look gracious, it makes him/her look like a stupid racist to have that grammatical error in the post.

       OP makes a great post about a conspiracy theory and you start calling him racist for a simple grammatical error? Then when OP politely tells you English is not his native language you double down on your assumptions of racism and call him a liar. WTF is up with you?

       For now is better to share the plausibility through the potential weapons, not sob unproven stories (not only from the US). We might be able to go further after the information about the use of these weapons gets disseminated. I'm from Spain.

       It would be interesting to spend a day in a faraday cage and see if you feel differently about anything.

       It would require more than 1 type of shielding if you don't know the frequency range you expect to shield against, so you need to be very clear about the faraday cage specifications and the probable range that "make you feel different" or that "doesn't work". I wonder if anyone already tried a faraday cage to shield against non-commercial electromagnetic frequencies.

       I don't believe you aren't an English speaker as it is a very specific error I've never seen in a foreigner.

       I won't be deleting my thoughts, ever..  First of all, I always own my shit, so feel free to look at my history.
      </p>
      <p>
       Second, I have never, ever seen anyone but a stupid racist say "I seen."  It's a really dumb mistake to make and while I get that OP knows how to look gracious, it makes him/her look like a stupid racist to have that grammatical error in the post.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't care what anyone else thinks about my opinion.  If you don't know how to speak correctly, it makes you look like your point is wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       Get that shit right.  You can post 18 links but not use accurate grammar?  Please.
