       Look at the comment section in
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6xyjmv/illuminati_member_tells_all_about_pizzagate_mk/">
        this OP
       </a>
       that
       <a href="/u/LightBringerFlex">
        /u/LightBringerFlex
       </a>
       posted.  I'm just...beside myself with the amount of vehement "she's lying and only trying to sell a book" comments In there.  It's like...seriously?  I understand that not everyone who claims they got raped actually got raped, and I understand that there are enough charlatans in this world at this point for people to be skeptical about certain claims, but, again, the vehemence of some of the comments immediately vilifying the speaker seem entirely imbalanced and very uncritical.
      </p>
      <p>
       Kind of reeks of either intense shilldom or no-less-intense useful idiots.
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT:  This one user in particular (who I won't even bother naming, but who one can guess who it is by simply reading the trolling comments in this thread) is trolling and stalking and PMing constantly right now attempting to...to...hell, I don't know
       <em>
        what
       </em>
       they're trying to do...I guess bully?
      </p>
      <p>
       It's pretty stupid on their part, but it's at least indicative of the very thing I'm talking about in the OP.
      </p>
      <p>
       Very weird and disturbing that people are actually like this and defend this kind of activity.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        EDIT 2
       </strong>
       :  Holy shit.  I just got banned from this sub! lol.  It states it's for "repeated shill accusations", but I wonder if HALF the users in this thread have therefore been banned because
       <em>
        everybody's
       </em>
       been calling everybody a shill.
      </p>
      <p>
       Uh...WTF is going on?

       Can't prove it. They would just say "I was browsing new and just happened to see it!" And how would I prove otherwise? And that is when they actually comment in both places. I was more referring to the voting. Like when the post was 10min old, and there was an asshole comment showing 1min old with 4 upvotes. I mean ya, that is fucking obvious. But not provable.

       If it can be empirically proven that vote manipulation and brigading is happening, without causing any harassment along the way of gathering the data, I don't see why it could not be acted upon. However, that might be a thing better sent to modmail or the admins (lol) for review. I think an open post about it would probably be a bad idea, and there would be no guarantees some part of reddit would not come down the wrong way on it.

       It can and
       <em>
        has
       </em>
       been proven already.  What is
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franklin_child_prostitution_ring_allegations">
        this
       </a>
       and

       </a>
       And that's just one example.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not that it can't be proven.  It's that after it gets proven, not only do the plebs simply keep their heads in the sand and don't want to see what's real, but the proof that's there is ultimately protected by an extremely powerful cadre of extremely evil beings - human and/or non-human.

       I upvoted you, btw, so I'm not fighting w/you here...but yeah.  This shit's been proven.  It's happening and it's epidemic.  Systematic pedophilia is very, very real, unfortunately.

       Notice how my account actually has discussions, good to know you saw that post though. I figured there was an odd reason none of the regulars bothered to touch it, but I knew it had to have been said. Go on, I'm not ashamed of my comments that call out the blatant cancer in this sub.

         Which is why I find it so odd that it's nearly impossible to have a contained conversation about one of them without people crying about why we aren't talking about the other. It's always the same people too.
-Hillary Post
"I wonder what TD users are trying to hide now"
-Trump Post
"Haha, time's running up losers! I wonder what sorts of Hillary and Pizzagate posts will be spammed to bury this thread"
They don't want civil discourse, regardless of the topic.

         Oh no, a Hillary post.
I'm now blind to all other topics in the sub, why have you done this to me? I want to complain more about Trump but now that this post exists I cannot keep my eyes away from it!
I've now completely forgotten the 5+ top posts on the sub that discussed Trump's horrible pardon decision, thanks guys.

         Did you assume that these totally organic users that piggyback off eachother's quick jabs at the subreddit whenever a Hillary thread is posted are here to do anything else?

         A bunch of users who regularly comment together dissenting anything that has to do with Hillary has come to let us know that it wasn't actually Hillary who sent the email.

         I wouldn't be mad if you banned 80% of the users in this thread, interesting how they always comment in packs regarding anything Hillary related, especially when they are able to use it as a step up to dissent the sub, its users and moderators, it's pretty much a /r/TopMindsOfReddit thread when they decide to hop in with the fake voting.
Once again, another prime topic for discussion and this bullshit is at the top of the thread.

         The lack of self-awareness in these votes are pretty telling, this entire sub was being smeared with "you believe in x therefore you must support Trump" since before the election in order to devalue topics that were otherwise non related to Trump at all. Didn't work that direction, now when people suck-up to MSM and get called out for doing exactly that you're spinning it the other way.
Fact is, any "debunking" or "professional jounalistic discussion" of any of these topics are no more substantial in content than Stephen Colbert and Rachel Maddow's silly attempts to steer the masses away from inconvenient facts.

         Didn't even have to check the history to see the correlation, we used to get brigaded, now we are getting straight up astroturfed. There's a slight distinction between the two, but an important one.

         Spoiler - It wasn't, just a load of MSM telling you it was without touching base on any of the details, just like Pizzagate.
Well, it only took a couple weeks since the admins came and performed the cleansing but here were are in the new r/conspiracy, where the posts are astroturfed and substational discussion is derailed and buried.

       Yeah, people make some crazy jumps in logic to attack people who are remotely skeptical here.  They:
      </p>
      <p>
       1)  Post about pedophilia.  Make sure to not back up any claims.  Maybe even post something that's easily disproved.
      </p>
      <p>
       2) Call anyone skeptical of the unverifiable or provably false claims a pedophile or a pedophile defender.  Don't address their questions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then they ask "why are you even here?" to people wondering about sources, authenticity, or veracity of claims.  Certain people would believe a lot less bullshit if their start point was disbelief and they had to be persuaded into believing.  Rather than immediate acceptance and belief of a theory/claim.

       I didn't address elite pedophilia.  I've seen a lot of wild claims related to pedophilia here.  And due to the subject people buy in with little to no proof and skeptical people are downvoted.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example there was a post the other day about an orphanage next to a house filled with pedophiles.  The post was misleading/lying but heavily upvoted anyway despite the fact you could easily disprove the claim for yourself.

       There's a reason that they chose pedophilia as the sinister crime to accuse people of... You can't wash off the stain of the accusation, so it also makes for a very effective weapon against skepticism.

       You commented negatively to the negative posters in that thread.  Why post it here?  You want us to defend her?

       I wasn't part of that thread.  This sub is generally sensitive to the abused.  Looks like some people felt she was a fake trying to sell a book I guess.

       This one user in particular (who I won't even bother naming, but who one can guess who it is by simply reading the trolling comments in this thread) is trolling and stalking and PMing constantly right now attempting to...to...hell, I don't know

       Come on...you never answered his REAL question...are you illiterate?
      </p>
      <p>
       One thing that fascinates me is how these guys try to get under your skin by making things emotional, when obviously they have NO emotion.  If you want evidence for reptilians, there ya go.  Lack of actual compassion.  I wouldn't attack someone's LITERACY if they were struggling with a very real moral issue.  I fail to see how these are not rules violations; not that I am accusing, but I fail to see the value in those comments at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       The instant end for any discussion on here should be when the person you are responding to tells you what YOUR own state of mind is.  My brother does the SAME thing to me IRL very frequently, and it's taken a while to get rid of the "killswitch" in your mind that causes internal anguish from these bozos.  Maybe the lowest hanging fruit in terms of getting someone to have a hair trigger reaction.  It's Schaudenfraude, and I don't doubt that, maybe subconsciously at a minimum, some people get their kicks off doing it.  It's almost as scary as your main topic, but obv. way worse in scope.

       Uhhh...it's not internal, which is exactly my point.  There are external realities outside ourselves, and you just confirmed all my points with your comment.  That's why I butt in on these threads, because I understand the emotional attachment, and you cannot.  Childishness is fine when called for, but not all the time, and the REAL people on here recognize this.  Good luck when karma rapes you.

       What, so now you are at my beck and call?  I want you to go back to calling me names.  You are the one who said later, TWICE.  So, you are coming back, not me.  Because you are trying to save face and real life karma, and downvoting me won't help.  It's too late, this is my last response in this thread, and may the actual God, my father, not have mercy on your soul.  And please, respond and use God's name against me.  I won't respond back, but I just wanna see it.  I have no regard for your personal karma, and it'd be an interesting test.  It would give you some puzzling evidence, no doubt.  As you say, later dude!

       Sure. But now it's time for you to tell a tale. Are you a ProTools-y live recording guy, or an electronic music guy? I'm always interested to hear peoples' workflows especially if they're idiosyncratic. The typical ways to use stuff tends to bore me to death.

       No need. As a trained, lifelong musician i can write my own arpeggios, lol. And if I ever need to do some horseshit like that I'd use Logic's arp MIDI FX which is more full-featured than cthulu and can be easily stacked.

       Skinning just means the sound, like how a UI is just a aesthetic skin. I didn't invent the term, and I wasn't using it to brag. I don't really think much of what softsynth sound I end up using as much as the compositional stage.

       Perhaps her abuse at such a young age created her intelligence.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have a theory that children that have had traumatic experiences develop at least in small part, photographic thinking.  The brain learns to create snapshots, if not seconds to minutes of moving images, as part of the psychosomatic experience.  And this type of pattern then repeats further as the brain develops through time.
      </p>
      <p>
       While this does not mean they have a perfect memory, nor that they are 100% correct about everything they think or understand, it does provide a window in how some people are able to recall early memories.
      </p>
      <p>
       And this can sometimes translate to having an increase in intelligence later in life due to being able to thoughtlessly remember information, but again, does not mean they are always correct in thinking.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for whether the traumatic experience is worth the "trade off", that depends entirely on the person, if the theory is true of course.

       A good way to think of it is in terms of survival. When any animal is in a life or death situation, they will kick into auto-survive mode and just get out alive. But they will also in a primitive way retain the knowledge they gained from that life or death experience. Hence, PTSD. Hence repressed memories (for survival). Hence the reason trauma based mind control exists.

       I've never been a (nonhuman) animal, so I don't know how animals think, therefore I cannot know if it is just fight or flight.
      </p>
      <p>
       Have you been an animal (nonhuman animal)?  Can you tell me how an animal (nonhuman animal) thinks?  Can an animal's brain remember in what is commonly called photographic-memory?  I believe you would need to be a nonhuman animal to tell us definitively, so I'm all ears/eyes to know this.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am a human, and have had traumatic childhood experiences, so I very much can say why I believe the way I do about how some other humans develop photographic memories after traumatic childhood experiences.  Are you able to say the same?

       I remember even certain regular/mundane things from when I was three - to say nothing of the extent to which I would remember things if they were traumatizing - so her early recollection isn't anything to invalidate her over.

       Maybe not because she's really smart. But possibly because she's really dissociative.

       I didn't watch the whole thing, but having a mind fragmented by trauma can cause a person to have SELECTIVELY very accurate memory, which is part of why MKUltra is even a thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       A fragmented mind can focus very deeply and retain very deeply, kind of like ADHD/ADD.

       I can rememeber  events of my life when  I was very young still vividly  to this day,  and when I'm mean very young I'm talking about 2-3 years old.
       <br/>
       We don't give enough credit to kids memories  at that age.... And I'm pretty sure if i went through  things like this I would never forget,  even if the details aren't exactly  the same as I remember  I sure wouldn't forget  that main details.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just looking  at the down votes in this  posts it's pretty obvious  when this kind of topic is spoken it's  shunned in the hardest ways.  Hmm why would that be......

       And none of those occasions involved being traumatized beyond belief.  Those sound like normal, even happy memories.  Trauma tends to sear itself in the memory a lot more than other types of memories.

       That is what she would have been told by a psycologist, anybody who touts IQ as a measurement of intellect is not truly intellectual.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have read that traumatic experiences are burned into memory - whether it is repressed and forgotten is another thing entirely. It is very possible that she remembers the traumatic experiences from her early childhood - it does not depend on IQ, we should not let her arrogance discredit her story.

       We have to keep unmasking the shills and exposing their plots like this so people can clearly see what's going on. The cabal's worst fear is exposure since nobody wants to be around dangerous wolves. Eventually, we have to arrests the Rothschilds who are financing all of this.

       Agreed.  There are quite a few accounts in here (pretty young ones at that) that are heavily upvoted and that are being quite critical of anyone attempting to defend her testimony, however.  Hell, I'm still getting trolling, stalking PMs from people who are apparently
       <em>

       triggered by my "daring" to call what's happened to her horrible.

       If it was that frog guy that was shouting at you earlier, he was banned. Interestingly enough, he deleted most of his comment history before I could capture it- which is a shame because yesterday he was asking an op why he though 12-14 year-old girls shouldn't be able to consent.  Unfortunately, I was too busy to do anything but lurk at the time.

I mean, I literally remember the french fries and chocolate shake I got at Bob's Big Boy while my grandparents and I were waiting for my brother to be born- I was 28 mos old and I'm in my late forties now.

       Exactly.  I'm in my mid forties and I remember the
       <em>
        exact
       </em>
       location and appearance of a beach enclave I was in when I was only three back in my homeland of Puerto Rico.  Went back there again when I was in my late thirties and it looked
       <em>
        exactly
       </em>
       like I remembered it.  I remember being dunked in a swimming pool by my mother in an

        Infant Swimming Class

       for new mothers that she was in with me when I was...shit before I was

        one

       .

       Good drama mongering. Some posters stating the person in question is just trying to sell a book. Actually literally one poster is doing what you are accusing here multiple people off and was downvoted.

       There is literally
       <em>
        no
       </em>
       way to cause enough of a scene over the possibility of child molestation.  How the fuck do people like you think it's to ANY extent okay to
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       sound every alarm possible over serious allegations of child abuse?
      </p>
      <p>
       The idea that you call someone who's actually concerned about abuse and molestation a "drama queen" beggars belief.  If you had a child and something horrible were happening to them, I don't see how you wouldn't want to sound every alarm possible - assuming for the moment that it wouldn't be you yourself who would be the one causing the abuse in the first place...which at this point, I'm honestly not sure it wouldn't be.

       I see your position didn't shift one bit from triggered hysterical drama queen. When a case happened more than half a decade ago it's perfectly fine to not go overly emotional especially so if you aren't personally involved but maybe you are yourself a victim of abuse in that case my condolences. I don't know anything about the case at hand but having a different opinion on a very specific case doesn't constitute anything you allege but then again I am pretty sure you are either being intellectually dishonest or just not capable of spotting the difference.

       I also don't invite bands that sing about pedophilia and have FBI documented pedophile symbols in their videos to play at my personally owned business.

       I also don't have connections to convicted pedophiles and human traffickers or take part in occult rituals like mock cannibalism or jerking of on the effigy of a child and then throwing blood on it.

       Of course you can cause too much of a scene. All the people whose lives were ruined over false allegations in the Satanic panic come to mind. You would have been screaming for their blood and calling anyone who doubted a pedo supporter. I don't want to see a single case of false accusation. A remote possibility isn't good enough, I want actual proof. Will stand up in a court of law proof.

       They're not merely questioning her veracity.  They're vilifying and marginalizing her in an entirely unnecessary manner - a manner that makes one wonder if they're actually attempting to defend what she's fighting against.  That's a far different thing altogether.

       You make a good point, unfortunately the shills have latched onto your comment to try and spur an organic opposition to OP's post.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's true, you don't see anyone on this sub actually defending pedophilia. Instead you see dismissive comments that usually single out the OP and bully them into submission. It's pretty easy to spot.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example; I've been coming to this sub for a very long time and never once have I had the inclination to tell somebody how stupid they are because they believe in something that I don't. And we get a lot of stupid theories here.
      </p>
      <p>
       The shills regularly distance themselves from the sub with phrases like "they actually believe Topic A here" and "I would never fall for Topic B like the morons here do.".
      </p>
      <p>
       As if anyone on Reddit honestly leaves their safety bubble to challenge their own ideas. These shills act like everyone stops in at this sub for a good laugh. That's how they believe or how they want us to believe that the internet works.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like walking into a bar full of regulars and not noticing the two loud assholes in the corner that nobody knows. Shills are only here to wear on our constitution. How many waves of bullshit can you take before you break? They're not here to trick anyone, it's an endurance game. How many times can you walk into your regular bar and get called an asshole by strangers before you break their nose?
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, I'm rambling but your comment is poignant. Shills don't defend pedophilia, they mock the idea that any government agency could be involved in human trafficking...because it's true.

       I've been here for years - and yeah.  I know this sub is quite compromised in fact.  However, even as long as I've been here, I haven't personally received as heavy and vehement a backlash attempting to defend pedophilia as I've gotten here.  Shit's crazy really.  I'm getting PMs from people throwing ad hominems left and right, etc.  Very telling.

       I'm a little dubious of this claim. A post with just 70 or 80 upvotes and only 60 something comments, and you're getting a flood of PMs from it?

       You should post screenshots.

       Okay.  I'll try, but I just reported and blocked one of the PMs I've been getting, so I don't know if that'll effectively block all the PMs they've sent thus far.

       And if you want to be dubious, fine.  Go ahead.  I've exactly zero reason to lie about this, however.

       Quite a lot of the comments I'm getting - both here in the open form and quite a few via PM as well - don't in the least seem like people trying to do things "for fun", however.  These are people that are triggered or paid, and are taking very seriously their attempts at bullying.

       is conservative, because conspiracy theorists are conservative, in general. You can't believe that 9/11 was an inside job, REALLY, and want the government to have more power, so mainstream liberalism is out.
      </p>
      <p>
       We got Trump elected... the alternative media, including
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       , and so honest and duplicitous liberals see us as a threat. We ARE a threat.
      </p>
      <p>
       Count on a presence here for the foreseeable future, from those who fear us when we speak together. We killed the TPP, through Trump (as much of an ass as he is :)). We got vaccines into the conversation. They have to stop the bleeding, so they are attacking us. Some are ideologues and some are paid.
      </p>
      <p>
       They stand out like a sore thumb, and as long as people know they are here, they are next to harmless. Actually, I've been here for years now, and it has been really instructive to see this sub get actively attacked.
      </p>
      <p>
       Suddenly, a post attacking Trump has 5000 upvotes. WOW. That is instructive.

       To be honest with you, I'm not really very familiar (read "not at all" honestly) with "left" or "right" or "liberal" or "conservative".  I've never been too up on those labels and have pretty much always seen them as two sides to the same monolithic beast - so I stay as far away as I can from either.  That said, anyone who has an interest in stopping pedophilia - whether left/right/conservative/liberal - I am

       No, it just means that a lot of conspiracists immediately suspect "think of the children!" rhetoric, since it is so often deployed by politicians to push bullshit policies like censorship and communications control.

       So, when you say "OMG pedophiles!" without a coherent argument, people get suspicious.

       What does that have to do with anything? The fact that you being up a random 
pedophile means you probably secretly want to bone kids, as all the pedophile loving shills do.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's the level of discussion this topic gets around here. Anyone who disagrees with any part of the original story has been labeled a pedophile-loving shill. Frankly, it's disgusting.

       Questioning the validity of some or all of the statements she's made isn't defending pedophilia nor is it them vilifying a victim of abuse. This sub, as someone else has already stated, is about questioning every thing and there ARE something things that do seem a bit strange to me when it comes to her story, such as being able to remember things from when she was two since it is very VERY unlikely she would be able to even if she has a high IQ. I can also see why people are miffed about her pushing her book in this since it makes things a bit more sketchy. Do I doubt she was a victim of abhorrent abuse? No. Am I saying anyone who is legitimately harassing her or being unnecessarily malicious are not assholes for being like that to her? No. People here SHOULD question things since that's a big part of what this sub is for. I don't mean to come off as rude, but I get the sense that OP is trying to stir things up more and cause a bit of drama. I'm sure she'll be just fine since she's survived much more horrors than a few internet douchebags.

       If you know anything about my post history - which you obviously don't since you said the things you said - you'd know I'm not one to try to "cause drama".  I don't give a fuck about most things, as a matter of fact.  This OP has nothing to do with any attempt at "causing drama".  Remembering events from early on is not all that out of the ordinary - especially if those events are traumatic.  There have been MANY people who have gone through similar tragedies, so such things definitely happen.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is
       <em>
        nothing
       </em>
       more important than protecting the young of a species.  If you don't do that, you HAVE no species.  You are nothing.  Trying to downplay someone getting legitimately mad at anyone who comes across as defending pedophilia is greatly, greatly morally corrupt on your or anyone's part.

       Traumatic events do stick with you, I know that very well, but I'm only saying it's very unlikely she remembers things from when she was two, not that it was impossible.

       People who do things to the youth of our society are deplorable, there is no contesting that, but you seem to have misunderstood what I am trying to say. Yes, reports of sexual abuse should be taken VERY seriously but on the other hand accusations of sexual assault should be taken just as seriously. I get the feeling many of the people questioning her validity merely feel there is a lack of evidence to her claims. I'm sorry if my wording is still rather strange or not understandable, I have a hard time properly wording things.

       I don't disagree with that.  However, the fact that there is such a proven, ubiquitous epidemic of pedophilia on this planet means that accusations of child sexual assault should be taken VERY seriously and not knee-jerkingly vilified as so many have done in this OP.

       I don't get that feeling based on how far they're going with their "questioning".  They're not merely questioning.  They're heavily attacking via a
       <em>
        lot
       </em>
       of ad hominems.  They're going quite a bit further than one needs to in simply "questioning" something.  They're not really questioning so much as attacking.  That's a different thing altogether.

       Yes, child sexual assault should be taken very seriously, I don't disagree with that but if people are truly going too far, I highly suggest ignoring them or blocking them if it is too much. Many will try to say things to get your goat so it is best to not let ignorance hurt you so.

       You literally created a thread to call out people who questioned a story you believe in, then have spent the entire thread attacking people and claiming that you're being victimized by a harassment campaign. That's the very

       The vast majority of adults don't recall memories from earlier than 3 to 4 years old, and full memories don't typically become clear and common until nearing 5.

       out of the ordinary.

       Things are nowhere near as simplistic as you're interpreting them.  I posted the same OP prior to
       <a href="/u/LightBringerFlex">
        /u/LightBringerFlex

       doing so, and those "three people questioning" have somehow not only gotten a LOT more numerous, boisterous, and triggered in this thread, but have move forward with sending shit PMs - so yeah.  I don't think it's quite as much a nothing issue as you're thinking.

       The way to combat shills is through a relentless commitment to civility and debate based upon critical analysis. Calling others shills or otherwise implying it just helps shills accomplish their goal: the complete distruction of productive discourse.

       Productive discourse cannot be destroyed by a shill or any other group of actors in a public exchange, its murder is a participatory, mutual affair.
      </p>
      <p>
       When someone comes at you with bullshit(be it shill or useful idiot, and it pretty much is impossible to tell the two apart; these domestic psyops are designed to recruit unpaid agents to unwittingly parrot and defend propaganda) the best way to shut it down completely is to use cold logic to point out factual inaccuracies, logical fallacies, anything you can demonstrate to be incorrect without having to resort
       <em>
        appeal to emotion
       </em>
       or
       <em>
        guilt by association

       There are occasions when an individual - myself at times included in this categorization - at the specific moment of refutation, does not have or cannot recall the particular points that would effectively do away with an argument using cold logic.  This is not to say that logic would not be able to thoroughly do away with the argument in question.  it is to say that there are, again, times when an individual either doesn’t recall the specific refutation points that would do away with said argument, or said argument is being pushed by an individual who’s interest is not at all in logically debating in the first place.  They are instead intent only on being what is called in common internet parlance, the proverbial troll.  These types of personalities care not for an argument whether logical, well-thought-through or not.  That is why they’re trolls.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are many of those here.
      </p>
      <p>
       As such, and again, productive discourse is regularly enough not even part of the operating mode of conduct as it relates to many individuals who come on to shill certain particularly sensitive points or issues.  “Productive discourse” with these types is simply not possible on regular occasions.

       Again, your name-calling is childish and non-productive.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you are unable to support your arguments with facts and logic, both you and everyone on the community that you would have otherwise posted in would be better served if you educated yourself before posting. We all have access to the same internet, critical thinking and combating logical fallacies are skills to be learned.
      </p>
      <p>
       Productive discourse does not require two cooperative parties, if conducted in a public sphere. It is enough to relentlessly stick to the topic at hand in a civil and critical tone. Even if you don't convince the other party(and you very often won't) it is clear to undecided or questioning lurkers who follow the exchange that one party is arguing in good faith and the other is being intellectually dishonest. And even if no one else reads the exchange, there is great value in developing your own ability to critically evaluate information.

       I am vocal against the pizzagate moral panic because I truly believe that elite child abuse is rampant, and that if PG isn't a psyop designed to distract conspiracy folks while discrediting the very idea of elite pedophilia, then it at the very least behaves exactly as if it were.

       My God you're dumb bro. She's a shill. Did you even watch the video, plus the other 2 parts? I did and she's full of shit. She's lying about a lot of stuff. You can hear when she gets caught off guard with certain questions outside of her story. She stutters and answers with nonsense. It's depressing that there are people this stupid on this planet. Ugh.

       Honestly, after a trip overseas I kinda always am skeptical about these sex traffic stories. Don't get it twisted, I am 100% against forcing anyone to have sex against their will, or fucking kids. Period. Full stop.
      </p>
      <p>
       Having said that, I have spoken with a few bar girls. According to the media, all these women are sex slaves and being taken advantage of. I assure you most are not. Hell, my fiance is a former bar girl. As stupid as that may be (feel free to call me dumb) it is what it is.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also know a few hookers. Trust me, the money they make has me wishing I was born with a vagina.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, some women are being trafficked. That's fucked up and it needs to stop. But most of the times these groups only hassle consenting adults to push a narrative cause there is big money in exploiting virtuous morons from their money.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's the same thing with prostitution. People act like all hookers are poor women down on their luck who are being taken advantage of by evil men. Mea while most of these chicks make more money than all of us and willingly sell their ass cause it's easy money.
      </p>
      <p>
       So yeah, I don't blame folks for being skeptical on this one. It's like those pedo laws designed to help children, but mostly lock up 18 year olds who happen to be dating a freshman.

       Stopped reading right there.  If that’s your litmus test for whether an individual is telling the truth or not, then you’ve definitely failed, as I’m not the only one in this thread alone who recollects things from being as young as the individual in the video.

       Your thinking people don't/can't remember things when young simply means you're ignorant of all the occasions when people do and have.  Pretty basic.  Hell there are
       <em>
        various
       </em>
       people - myself included -
       <em>
        IN THIS VERY THREAD

       that have memories from before the age of 5.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nowhere near as uncommon as you think.  You're taking your ignorance and thinking it applies ubiquitously.  That's not even ignorance at that point.  It's hubris - a far worse thing altogether.

       Youre gonna love this. Since I made this post I have been responded to on here by someone who has posted only twice, ever, in the six months his account has been active. All he is trying to do is draw me into a pointless debate(as they always do). Then another account that hasnt posted a single time in the last six months responded to a comment of mine from two months ago calling me a nazi.
      </p>
      <p>
       They are literally digging through my post history for responding in a positive way to you. Once again shows we are in the right :)

       "You're an elite pedophile. Here's some quotes taken out of context that proves it." 
That's why some people don't jump straight on the pitchfork and torch bandwagon. Plus yall say yall believe it but honestly if there is a pedophile ring encompassing various powerful world leaders and you have evidence yall don't believe it enough to actually do anything about it or suck at convincing anybody worthwhile your evidence is factual

       its unfortunate that the people who are concerned about pedophilia have so little credibility. Maybe they couldve gotten something actually productive done amd helped some real people if they actuaply looked for pedophiles in stead of using the issue to go on a witch hunt against their political opponents. Oh well, guess its too late now.

       The mere fact you think the only way to get an arp down in accurate 32nds is by hand kinda says it all, man. There are numerous ways to do this that don't involve using arpeggiators. Why dont you start a thread and ask edmproduction.
