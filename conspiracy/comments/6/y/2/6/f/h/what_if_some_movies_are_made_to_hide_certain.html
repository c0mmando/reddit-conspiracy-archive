        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>So this isn&#39;t a great example but an instructor of mine said she couldn&#39;t google theories on how animals made it to Madagascar because the only thing that came up was the movie &quot;Madagascar.&quot; So I don&#39;t think this is true in this example but could there be a motive to making movies with certain names and plots to cover up things? (I don&#39;t think they are doing this for Madagascar because I don&#39;t know what they would want to hide.) But can anyone think of any other movies or motives for this? Even if it&#39;s not real it&#39;s still an interesting thought.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;SEO&quot; is a common phrase in internet marketing and stuff. there are lots of things people can do to manipulate SEO, search trends and histories. </p>

<p>i doubt anyone is making entire movies to throw a wrench in the works, but SEO is definitely manipulated. </p>

<p>google has pulled so far left and is so blatant about it, they dont really need a movie to be popular to use it as a distraction. if google was trying to hide facts about Madagascar, Google would just play dumb and give you results like </p>

<p>Lam-Elisa TB Test</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Mycobacterium tuberculosis that causes Tuberculosis (TB) is tested by a test called “LAM-ELISA” and this test kit was made before 2009.</p>

<p>On August 27, 2009, Biomed Central reported that Urine LAM-ELISA does not appear to be useful as an independent diagnostic test for pulmonary tuberculosis. A trial of the new diagnostic found that it was only capable of identifying 50.7 percent of TB cases and this 50.7% sensitivity of the LAM-ELISA was disappointingly low. The specificity of 87.8 % also fell far short of expectations.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is kind of like something frustrating I noticed a couple months ago. I&#39;ve been trying to research Karl Rove&#39;s connection to the CIA, since election fraud lawyer Cliff Arnebeck says that Rove was carrying GHWBush&#39;s bag when he was CIA director. But whenever I search &quot;karl rove cia&quot;, I only see results about the Valerie Plame scandal. So if Rove indeed had a hidden CIA past, his outing of Plame had the effect (intentional or not) of burying it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This theory doesn&#39;t make a bit of sense. The Fast &amp; The Furious series predates Operation Fast and Furious by close to a decade. In fact, the ATF operation was named after the <em>movies</em>, not the other way around.</p>

<p>And they keep making the movies because <em>they make a ton of money</em>. These things rake in cash hand over fist, and early on made good bank on relatively modest budgets. Of <em>course</em> they were going to keep making them. That&#39;s what Hollywood <em>does</em>. It goes where the money is.</p>

<p>If anything, you&#39;ve got your theory in reverse. They named the operation after the movies in 2009, by which time there were four movies in the franchise, in part to hide the name from searches, not the other way around.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Similarly, Black Lives Matter was forced into popularity at the perfect time to obscure the Bundy BLM goings on. How about the dab? That went from twenty-somethings smoking cannabis concentrates in their garage to Hillary Clinton trying to do an endzone dance/ pose on Ellen. How about the term &quot;thot&quot; while we&#39;re on this? What better way to demonize thought than by turning the eyed into a negative slang phrase?</p>

<p>The BLM thing was a real distraction. The other two I brought up could just be the short sighted nature of the common person. One syllable words being recalculated doesn&#39;t necessitate a conspiracy, but it&#39;s possible. Greek yogurt gets more tv airtime than Greece in turmoil. I don&#39;t know. You tell me.</p>

The movie doesn&#39;t only drown Internet searches, also brain searches. Ever since that movie, forget about using that name if you want to be taken seriously.</p>

<p>This practice of hijacking vocabulary is not new, doing it &quot;for Google&quot; is just the newest application. For example the child molesters in power came up with the term &quot;pedophilia&quot;, which means the opposite of what it&#39;s supposed to describe. </p>

<p>There are many more examples: antisemitism, skepticism, liberalism, equality, discrimination, etc.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Indeed you are absolutely right. </p>

<p>But it&#39;s fun to notice how these groupthink semantic weapons can be turned <em>against</em> groupthink as well. </p>

<p>Once I was interpelled by an older American couple sitting next to me in a restaurant in Stockholm (liberals, university teachers from Oregon, in their 50s), who were curious to hear me speak french. So we conversed a bit, then I asked the husband: &quot;can I ask you a question about America? Do many people in your country still believe in this crazy conspiracy theory peddled by the government about acrobatic pilots who are supposed to have used two aluminum planes on 911 to somehow pulverize three steel skyscrapers?&quot; </p>

<p>It was funny to see how embarrassed he was to be among the conspiracy theorists. He went &quot;hrm hrm you mean because of building 7 right ? hrm yes I know, it&#39;s weird, I should look into it&quot;. It seemed like it convinced him it might have been an inside job; he could identify with the idea, because it was framed as mainstream. </p>
