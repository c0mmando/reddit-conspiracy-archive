<p>“It all begins and ends in your mind. What you give power to has power over you.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Leon Brown</p>

<h1><strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2baCg8SHGM">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2baCg8SHGM</a> <em>Please</em> take the time to bookmark this video and watch it fully when you have the chance. It is, IMO, the most crucial collection of universal information for every human being that I have come across.</strong></h1>

<p>We all frequent this /r/ for one reason or another. Personally, I came here because I was astonished by the amount of people willing to think for themselves, as I had never been exposed to any group of people willing to question things and find the true logic and reason behind the world we see around us. And eventually, I saw that there was <em>no logic.</em> No reason. Here is a trailer for a good movie, dedicated to the idea of no reason <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWWufhqyGE8">Rubber</a>.</p>

<p>Now, obviously there is fundamental reason behind the actions of the powers that be, but there is no obvious answer when one begins to ask the questions and peer behind the curtain. The benchmark film <em>Everything is a Rich Man&#39;s Trick</em> begins to answer the question to the reason behind TPTB&#39;s actions, and that is simply <strong>money.</strong></p>

<p>Why is marijuana illegal while other drugs are? Why is health insurance so shitty in this country? Why are war and terror continually growing forces in the world?</p>

<p>For an intro to conspiracy, I would recommend [Requiem for the American Dream](<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3270538/">www.imdb.com/title/tt3270538/</a>) on Netflix.</p>

<p><a href="https://vimeo.com/116909615">Everything is a Rich Man&#39;s Trick: JFK to 911</a> is for the open minded, willing to face the reality of the fucked up world we live in.</p>

<p>However, I would like this post to discuss something that I believe goes beyond the simple idea of consolidation of money and power. This post is intended to be about the human brain, and how TPTB have hidden the true power of the human brain, while propagating constant distractions and seductions to keep the public <em>unaware</em>.</p>

<p>Graham Hancock has been a prominent figure in the questioning community for years, and his banned TEDx talk on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0c5nIvJH7w">The War on Consciousness</a> addresses the subject of a government suppressing the minds of the people.</p>

<p>We all know how fluoride is a widely known neurotoxin and calcifies the human pineal gland. HuffPo reports that fluoride induces lower IQ <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dr-mercola/fluoride_b_2479833.html">http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dr-mercola/fluoride_b_2479833.html</a>. Here is a very well sourced study about fluoride&#39;s long term effects on the pineal gland <a href="http://www.icnr.com/articles/fluoride-deposition.html">http://www.icnr.com/articles/fluoride-deposition.html</a></p>

<p>Oh yeah, and there are at least thousands more water systems with heavy metals like lead slowly poisoning their citizens <a href="http://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-lead-testing/">http://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-lead-testing/</a></p>

<p>There really is almost too much to discuss when it comes to human health and the US government, so I&#39;m not going to preach about how the sugar industry has been a plague on the world for decades, especially since they conspired against healthy fats and released a false report relating fats to heart disease. <a href="http://sugarscience.ucsf.edu/sugar-papers-reveal-industry-role-in-shifting-focus.html#.Wa2qvNPys1g">http://sugarscience.ucsf.edu/sugar-papers-reveal-industry-role-in-shifting-focus.html#.Wa2qvNPys1g</a></p>

<p>But thank goodness for corn syrup! <a href="http://newsroom.ucla.edu/releases/this-is-your-brain-on-sugar-ucla-233992">This is your brain on sugar: UCLA study shows high-fructose diet sabotages learning, memory</a></p>

<p>Joe Rogan has Rhonda Patrick on his podcast where she continually cites research explaining why carbs and processed sugar have harmful effects on the body, and therefore the mind. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxM_CLsvieE">JRE #901</a></p>

<p>Now that we have determined that TPTB are likely, at the very least, highly neglectful of it&#39;s citizens, <em>what are we to do?</em></p>

<p>Here, Rupert Sheldrake explains the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKHUaNAxsTg">&quot;Science Delusion&quot;</a> and why our current dogma based model of scientific understanding is preventing further scientific discovery beyond what we currently perceive as possible. Another banned TEDx.</p>

<p>Here, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFlAFo78xoQ">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFlAFo78xoQ</a>, Joe Rogan has Michael Shermer, publisher of <em>Skeptic</em> magazine, known for its role as a scientific limited hangout, Graham Hancock and Randall Carlson, both known for their extensive research and evidence for a technologically advanced ancient global civilization, on his podcast. It becomes very clear, by the end of the podcast, that the people at <em>Skeptic</em> are nothing more than egotistic, petty, little men afraid of new information simply because it challenges their performed mindset.</p>

<p>With this attack on new ideas and different ways of thinking, it should not be a surprise that the confusion that has resulted in this 50+ years of real technological stagnation is so abundant. </p>

<p>In another banned TEDx talk, physicist Russel Targ explains the decades of work he did with the CIA with remote viewing. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBl0cwyn5GY">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBl0cwyn5GY</a>. Here is the CIA doc <a href="https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP96-00789R003300210001-2.pdf">&quot;Project Star Gate&quot;</a> American tax dollars were literally officially going towards something not officially possible according to mainstream physics for several years. How?</p>

<p>As humans, we all have the capability to do great things. We must only open ourselves to the <em>possibility</em> in order to achieve them. Dan Winter has spent decades studying what he calls the &quot;Science of Bliss&quot; among other biomagnetic theories like heart coherence. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76xCnepM9TY">Here</a> he explains the math behind fractal field physics, golden ratio, and how it appears everywhere in the universe. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_wUttSr5Ds">Heart coherence</a> | <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cgE0tHCFiA">Hygeine of Bliss and Kundalini</a> | <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMzL07U7LEw">ET origins of life on Earth</a> | <a href="http://www.fractalfield.com/">Website</a> (very poorly organized, but in case you felt like clicking around and looking at the math and documents).</p>

<p>We, as human beings, are capable of much more than TPTB will have you believe. Through self discipline, meditation, willpower, strength, and fearlessness, anyone can do anything, including what is now considered &quot;magical.&quot; Please, just take the time to sit back and observe. You will find that the truth is very unclear when constantly studying, constantly thinking, constantly out of the moment. TPTB want you in constant fear. Constant thinking. Alan Watts explains how overthinking can put you into a matrix outside of reality, trapped in a state of indecision. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCxohnyfiBQ">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCxohnyfiBQ</a></p>
