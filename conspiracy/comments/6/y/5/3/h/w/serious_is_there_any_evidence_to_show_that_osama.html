       Considering his body was "buried at sea" there ain't damn thing to prove it, except for testimony. It's also worth noting that several months after this Seal Team 6 experienced a tragic helicopter crash which killed 17 of them, though supposedly none were involved in the raid.

       How certain are you that those Seal Team members didn't die from a helicopter crash the night of the raid?  Very suspicious activity surrounding that incident.

       Not all of them, according to OBL's next-door neighbor, who was interviewed by a local television program shortly after the raid.  The only active video source I could still find was a dailymotion one (

       ) with fairly low quality, but the transcript from the interview is in a few dozen locations if you look around.  His delivery isn't the most polished, but I still found it thought-provoking back when I first saw it six years ago.

       That is a lie. He died of Kidney failure in a hospital December 2001. The mainstream was told otherwise because the government wanted to get political points. Good for re-election, among other things.

       The point is that in May 0f 2011, United States (then) President Obama stood before TV cameras and proclaimed that his military killed Osama Bin Laden. That was a

       every single major figure has to have a half dozen reported deaths.

       Plenty. When some one wants to "debunk" a statement by a "conspiracy theorist" people point to the main stream media as proof. But is this case that would mean that either the President lied or the New York Times lied. They can't

       Haven't seen the article but the New York Times can / could simply be wrong, you are looking at the New York Times as though it is one single entity, this piece you are referring to likely was sourced from somewhere else and was a piece written by a single journalist within the NYT.

       Okay so now we have switched from Osama Bin Laden and thus Afghanistan / Pakistan to Iraq, the justification for Iraq may be related to 9/11 but they are hardly one in the same. Afghanistan happened weeks after 9/11, Iraq happened years. I'm not arguing that these entities don't lie, and they clearly lied in relation to Iraq. Also there is the distinct possibility that the intel was incorrect, the Iraqis were playing a game (not just with the Americans) of deliberate ambiguity.

      <p>
       Well its still to this day a bit inaccurate to call these actions "Bold faced lies" the reality of it is, neither of us know. A limited number of people actually know the full details of the level of knowledge the United States had in the lead up to the Iraq war, I like you am inclined to believe this level of knowledge was much more than being portrayed to the public but this is hardly a foregone conclusion. There is also the
       <em>
        small
       </em>
       point that these are two different presidents from two different competing parties. These people are out to hurt the United States this is basically indisputable OBL is either dead, or captured and presumed dead by his own there are no other options. Think logically for a minute here, if OBL had been dead for a decade this sort of thing would be quite easy to prove, this is the sort of thing that brings down a reelection campaign, even a presidency. My view has no basis in trusting these people, I just think its beyond ridiculous to establish your view in that OBL died a decade sooner than claimed because New York based news media ran with a story in the months after 9/11 that OBL had died especially with how common these sort of death claims are.

       All the better.  I mean even if you turned the original, you could never fully trust them.  But if you killed everyone who knew that the guy was dead for a fact, you could place your own imposter into the role and milk that for years.

       Why use the actual guy when you can put a more cooperative asset in his place?  Can you imagine what the CIA or other black op intelligence organization would do to have one of their own successfully become the shotcaller in that terrorist network?  I wonder how many people close to the original OBL would they need to kill in order to fool the rest?

       There was video of the raid and killing of bin Laden, he was photographed after being killed. None have been made public.
      </p>
      <p>
       Though there is reason to believe it happened, members of the republican part of congress were shown the video and photos and said he was dead. No member said otherwise.

       There is a zero percent chance that the official story is true.  Bin Laden was public enemy #1 and they kill him in the middle of the night, don't capture him or any of his associated for questioning, take no pictures (at least none shown publicly), and dump him in the water.  They paraded Saddam through the streets and hanged him, but Bin Laden just gets thrown away?  Then many of the members of that SEAL team die mysteriously in a chopper crash?  No way.
      </p>
      <p>
       The trial of Bin Laden would have been the biggest TV even of our lifetime and an enormous PR boost for Obama, but they didn't want that?  Bin Laden just happened to be living within a few miles of Pakistan's largest air force base?

       You don't trust The New York Times? The Washington POST?
       <em>
        They
       </em>
       reported him dead in 2001. So you only trust the main stream media when it is convenient but not when it exposes the fallacy of your biases?
