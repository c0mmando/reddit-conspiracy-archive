       We may live in an information age,  but secrets and taboo knowledge are as obscure as they ever were,   decoys of misinformation are rampant,  and the means for sorting it out are suppressed.
      </p>
      <p>
       So we can't agree on anything,   we are all speaking very specialized languages within our splintered reference groups,  carefully cultivated with the help of the bureaucracies (apparatchik,  nomenclatura,  parties,  corporate cultures,  entertainment venues,  and thousands of other institutional doctrinal systems from religion to science,  from law to sports,  from medicine to self medication culture.    Media now includes almost as many channels as there are social media accounts.    The age of linear information gathering has ended,  and we now must multitask and assimilate on the fly,  thus supplanting an age where deliberation was possible with an age where all hope of finding solutions outside of computer code,  genetic code,  or new layers of social controls, laws,  police powers,  military powers and regulations have been abandoned.    Absolutes are imposed in the midst of chaos and information overload.    For every uncertainty,  new certainties are attempted.  Unfortunately,  the new certainties seem to be uniformly ideological,  divisive,  and fundamentally out of touch.
      </p>
      <p>
       As proven with feral humans,  all of this technology can vanish in a single generation,  its extremely fragile.    Inefficiencies and corruption have pervaded many formal relationships,  but many of us are becoming increasingly reluctant to participate in these structures.
      </p>
      <p>
       So,  we moved from the ww2 generation (called "great") to the baby boomers,  through generation x,  through the millennials,  and now what is called generation z is coming into early adulthood on the hundred year anniversary of WW1 as full saturation of collapsing hope in the old guard bears fruit,  as the agenda flips from crisis to crisis at the fastest pace in history,  but the affairs of humans begin to be eclipsed by natural disasters that expose our infatuations as absurd.
      </p>
      <p>
       Every phone,  every computer device,  every camera,  every car,  and most structures,  most major components of our infrastructure are going to be eliminated and replaced during the next 20 years,  just as WW1 marked the disappearance of an earlier age,  and the birth of a new age when air travel,  radio,  phone,  electricity,  movies,  and many other innovations all arrived simultaneously and 90% of humans were dislocated within a generation resulting in the revolutions seen in Europe,  China,  and elsewhere.   The modern US emerged out of this,  narrowly avoiding revolution with a "New Deal" that contained the seeds for the total corruption of the labor movement,  and its ultimate demise,  the eventual suppression of workers rights in "free markets" that sovietized American lifestyles into a bland greyness of overindulgence, obesity,  massive drugging,  and hateful Kafka styled government institutions.    What emerges next is not going to be a tweaking of what we had for the last 100 years.   There will be plenty of time to deliberate on this madness,  and the attention span will stretch out enough to grasp the priorities of survival.   The human technology hybrid will advance,  but the survival will have to phase out the flitting attention span that is too out of touch with fundamental realities of the organic patterns nature adheres to.   No one can stay on a bender forever,  not during the roaring twenties,  and not in the world that was spawned in the adrenaline frenzy of overleveraged lifestyles (chemically enhanced as in amphetamines) embraced since the "Great Generation" came home "victorious".    The opium den and lethargy seem to be creeping in now.    There are alternatives to those who are still able to take a walk and admire a sunset,  or have any kind of aesthetic appreciation of that which existed before hybridization of our species.   Not to romanticize lives that were  'solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short',  but to connect with a world that spawned us in the first place,  along with an ecosystem that cannot be and will not be ignored for long,  and if forgotten,  will quickly remind us of its place,  will quickly shatter our made up dystopia.

       Your fundamental thesis is correct. Note that Aldous Huxley
       <a href="https://www.johnlebon.com/articles/the-epsilon-agenda-introduction/">
        spoke explicitly
       </a>
       about these things in Brave New World, but most people - even those interested in conspiracy topics - cannot and will not sit down and read the book for themselves.

       What are you talking about? In America, Brave New World has been the default required reading in high school since the 80's. Let's not forget we all had to read 1984, Fahrenheit 451, and Catch 22 as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       The unifying message of these books is practically shoved down our throats. Everyone reads these books, we just don't want to believe that they apply to our society.

       Aldous Huxley and his family were all Elitist, his brother basically started the transhumanism movement. Not sure what exactly Brave New World was meant to accomplish, or whether it was just predictive programming. But if you look into Aldous Huxley you will find he wasnt looking out for the underdog, and thats a nice way to put it

       i think the biggest issue for the lower classes is, that they don't value owning land, and that they don't see the hostility that exists in the world.
They don't care about having food, because they never had a lack of it during their life time. Yet it is what makes them live. They don't realize.

       I think that would still be possible. There is still plenty of land in the world that isn't cultivated. Also it's not necessarily about owning the land. Just making sure that no one cuts you off the supply chain.
But in a way you are right of course. It's hard to get land without going into debt nowadays. But still debt is not as worse as having no food
