       If that were the end-all be-all nail-clencher of the 911 case I'd be more inclined to support it. But there is already more than enough evidence to strongly suggest inside job, and in the long run stuff like that just pushes people away and further fragments the truth movement. I don't know if it's legitimate or not but to me it's not pertinent right now, when headway is actually made.

       So obvious once you see it. Only reason I can think this is so rapidly suppressed is the 'elite' want to retain their ability to perform "magic tricks" via TV and other media. I mean I guess that's a big deal, but I also feel like that cat's outta the bag, the horse has left the barn, etc.

       Still, the shillery against such an obvious point makes the shillery all the more obvious. It'd be fun to force themselves to look like fools once more.

       My wife had hers removed (and replaced with ceramic, can also get porcelain) two years prior to getting pregnant.  I advise all to do the same.  Detox the body.  Many stories of how people's behavior and mood changed once the influx of mercury was removed and detox'd out.

       He claims to be a member of ∼ 3000 years old secret society called Three. He revealed some Three's members, the oldest one he was willing to name was Plato, also Jesus, George Washington, and JFK.

       You read the first thread only, right? You need to see all of them, all 2000+ answers, plus there is some additional, related material to look at, such as an orbital ring space elevator project etc.

       I clicked on 5-6 and read all he said, saw 90% of anything he talked about that has came to pass has been completely wrong and the rest is just vague misleading answers, stuff already known, or random assumptions. His older stuff is the worst.

       I just went back and read that. Don't know much about the idea, but how exactly would it add tens of trillions to the economy? Launching things for essentially free would be a nice boost, but I think he's stretching its effects. Now if we started mining asteroids, that's a different story.

       Yeah but when he's completely wrong 9 out of 10 in that 5-6 you really don't have to keep digging though. Basically you don't have to study a turd under a microscope to determine it's a turd.

       Briefly (I could talk abou it for hours), by putting large solar power generating capacity into orbit (that's why launching stuff up to LEO/GEO almost for free is needed) which will raise the energy throughput of the economy. Imagine 20% plus GDP growth. Plus asteroid mining you mentioned etc.

       Nah, not wrong. For example, Trump wanted Flynn as VP at that time, had to accept Pence. Dismissing all he said based on this "failed" "prediction" would be shortsighted, IMO.

       As to CF? He claims they were involved with taking down the USSR, let me get the quotes for you:
      </p>
      <p>
       "Clinton is the one that walked back all the promises of US financial aid to Russia. FDR promised Stalin at Yalta that the US would act as the global infrastructure bank if Stalin conceded to US reserve currency. He was stabbed in back and they repeated the same thing a few decades later to get USSR to willingly dissolve. "
      </p>
      <p>
       "The Clintons were primarily involved on the domestic cocaine distribution networks that sent cash to Russia to buy off the mob, party leaders, etc., which facilitated a buying up of Russian assets. They made money both from skimming CIA cocaine profits and crony deals in buying up Russian assets after the USSR. "
      </p>

How focus and attention from one observer on an event can differ in results from an event with more people directing their focus and attention toward it, especially so if there's an expectation on the outcome.

       I support this suggestion. However I'm more interested on discussing the modern devices and artifacts used to effective brainwashing. Lets be coherent, these days it's difficult to provide LSD or other substances and perform a psychological "montage" like MKULTRA did to disrupt the victim, but technologies like military V2K (exploiting the microwave auditory effect: voices in ones mind) and other remote directed energy weapons designed to harm (ultra/infra sonic and microwaves) can disrupt a victim to the point of making a remote (re)programming possible.

       I have been saying for a few weeks and wanting to research more into the sissy hypnosis videos and forced fem. I understand it is a fetish niche' but I also feel there are nefarious purposes behind it. I had come across a video last year that had swastikas flashing throughout the movie that kept repeating how good it was to suck dick..My interest in this started when I read something about the nazi doctrine an the feminaization of men to destabilize a country. All for this topic./

       Yeah, it is over. It's strange that I grew up being taught about propaganda in the USSR and never in a million years thought I'd see it happen so blatantly in the west. This comes at the same time that main stream news has collectively fallen into a heap. And now someone will probably follow up with some comment pretending I'm talking about the Donald subreddit or Russian bots invading. Where are these Russian bots? I haven't seen evidence of them. And why did this sub feel so much more organic and authentic when it was supposedly being over run by the Donald subreddit?

       I guess that is exhibit A. Americans have been sold the notion they live in the land of the free when in reality it's pretty far from that. Not that I'm on a high horse, I'm Australian. Our country is so heavy regulated we might as well all be wearing monitoring collars.

       Considering the state of free speech in the developed world, yeah, I'd say America is
       <em>
        relatively
       </em>
       the land of the free. Of course we live in a police state with a rigged faux-two party system, but at least we can question the holocaust without doing prison time.

       we should talk about how confirmation bias is literally made up and how people will throw it out at you just because it has a wikipedia page instead of simply saying "i disagree," thus justifying to themselves why they're correct (confirmation bias, much? lol)

       And yet you just said you feel more natural surrounded by people who do exactly that.  It's not even a secret, the sub is
       <em>
        named
       </em>
       after the exact authority figure that's currently in power.  Maybe you need to rethink why you feel so at home amongst them?

       I have a background in qualitative research which includes analyzing feedback from training and rehab programs to gauge program impact. I have a good sense of the authentic and organic. Even if individual comments seem innocuous, they contribute to a bigger picture which can then lose the organic feeling as a structure. You don't need to have my background to see basic things like repetitive, predictable patterns emerge. If trump spammers are real they are doing a freaking good job sounding genuine and uncoordinated. Where are the Russian bots up voting them?

       But why? There's so much we can talk about right now (literally almost every conspiracy theory ever) that I think we should cover the most popular and go from there. Chasing the news is an easy way to get distracted from what really matters, and guaranteed we would bog this sub down into even more political discussions (which these roundtables are helping us get away from).

       I'm curious how hurricanes and earthquakes line up with Presidents, and I wonder if this is their doing or if it is the deep state causing chaos for them. I believe it would be telling as to who is really in control of haarp.

       Hey I'm an electrical engineer actually qualified to talk about that link! I dabbled in RF design in college visiting presentations from military and companies like Lockheed (who were the only types doing MMW radios when I was in school) alongside classes. I ultimately settled in analog power design but still have to worry about radiated electromagnetic. So not a genius authority on the matter, but able to smell B.S.
      </p>
      <p>
       The article (like many conspiracy articles) brings up some great points and then discredits itself with some bad understanding.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's start with what they do well: a lot of energy is going to be absorbed right in your outer layer of skin. This is due to a rather well understood effect called the
       <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin_effect#Material_effect_on_skin_depth">
        skin effect
       </a>
       which defines the skin depth. (Usually this refers to the outer part of a metal or inert material we are calling skin ... It's a little confusing using skin effect on skin)
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyways,  math aside water (most of the human body) has a low skin depth meaning lower frequencies pass through and higher frequencies get absorbed at the surface (fun fact: submarines use ridiculously low frequency radios to communicate very slowly with the surface). 5G would use very high millimeter wave (MMW) technology that is so far (to my knowledge) reserved for military and those airport TSA backscatter machines. This would get absorbed ast the outside of the skin.
      </p>
      <p>
       The effects aren't well documented. This is true as well. There was interest when the tsa introduced backscatter in health effects but I don't think much came of it.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's al true that official guidance is radio isn't dangerous if it doesn't cause heating. But heating a small area on the outside of the skin wouldn't really cause heating because the skin is a great heat sync and there inside of the body would just soak up heat. Wouldn't change the fact that the surface of the skin absorbed a high energy density. I know no research on the effects.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some complaints:
      </p>
      <p>
       1) the author of that page cited antenna gain (in decibel) increases as a fear. This is stupid. That means a receiver had to amplify a smaller signal (no radiation in amplification). It's the opposite of scary
      </p>
      <p>
       2) the author focuses on frequency not intensity.  ANY radio frequency is harmful with the right intensity. The author never included intensity levels in  linked articles or of the base stations. I haven't had time to go through and check but my gut ou'd they were omitted because they're an order of magnitude or more apart.

       oil is non sustainable, however, and russia, japan, china, and india are already pushing against it. people still use oil right now, but i think things will change. no one wants oil. everyone wants to stop NK and fix this climate change business.
      </p>
      <p>
       i have noticed that china is often put into a kind of biased light that makes them look reserved and greedy. i've been studying oriental culture and find it hard to believe that their TPTB would want anything bad for their community. we're talking about a country whose central philosophies are based on confucianism and the tao te ching. why would they want to destroy the planet/each other if they recognise it as a part of themselves?
      </p>
      <p>
       naturally, americans do not think this way. that's why eastern peoples seem alien, "funny", "weird", to the west. these people hold on to tradition strongly because of the west's attempt to conquer and slaughter millions across the globe. why would they trust the west in matters of caring for the world? english is a slaver's tongue. mandarin, japanese, urdu, russian, etc, are not.
      </p>
      <p>
       a good business deal would probably be the US creating its own clothes while china works on creating less poverty and more sustainability in their cities. the US will have to work on this too. they might dick around with currencies, but i can't see oil as being a solution.

       The Grand Divide: Conformists and Defectors
      </p>
      <p>
       It seems to me that the divide has never been more distinct and troubling.
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K0Ymbw1YlM">
        This clip sums it up
        <em>
         perfectly.
        </em>
       </a>
       It's funny, it's sad, and it's also kind of eye-opening.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've been having trouble with some family and friends; they really don't want to talk about some of the
       <em>
        weird thoughts that I have,
       </em>
       and how
       <em>
        I believe everything I read on the internet.
       </em>
       It's been a growing problem for a long time, and I know that I'm not alone. I've recently been understanding more and more that this is part of the divide and conquer tactics. It seems to be a huge filtering mechanism. In a hundred years or so, I worry there will be no more individuals, free-thinkers, or rebels; all thoughts will be doled out by the state. And sometimes I think we might be much closer to that than we realize. It seems there is quite the scarcity of rebels, and they are only getting more and more rare. Is this by design or just a side effect of some of the things that are going on in our society? It could make for a great discussion, and also help with the mental and emotional well-being of the readers of this sub.

       I can say a little about that. You can find a lot of great info and a lot of disinfo from people trying to cash in. I believe it boils down to the earth is as science says beyond the crust but the crust is a little/a lot thicker than we think and there are massive, and I mean massive, cave structures everywhere. Imagine these caves being so massive and so common it's almost like a hollow onion layer beneath out feet, and not a true hollow Earth as most imagine.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some are large enough to hold the largest cities on Earth with plenty of room left over and some are large enough to carefully fly around in. What it's like in these caves seems to be disappointing though, they are likely wet or mostly flooded, pitch dark, and either quite hot or cold depending on the depth. That doesn't mean some species haven't adapted to call them home, because at least in an insect and animal sense they certainly have and an uncountable number of unknown species likely live there, but us humans would find them no fun without extensive remodeling, which it seems we secretly have in a few places.
      </p>
      <p>
       Antarctica would be a great place to do some of this cave remodeling since the biggest problem we face is the heat and Antarctica would give us the ability to go bigger and deeper because of the temps and general magma levels and since the snow accumulates on the surface and it doesn't rain there the water levels inside the caves would be pretty dry.

       I saw a post about how the Titanic sank from an intentional engine fire and not an iceberg. The theory was that it was a plot to kill many of the elites/bankers that were on the voyage so the remainder could seize more power. I've always thought that ice wouldn't be able to split the hull and sink the vessel. I'd love to discuss this tbh. A nice break from the politics and shitstorm this sub has become

       Pretty general, but I'd like to put more talk on what I consider end-game conspiracy on how our entire reality is set up for humans to be caught in the game of 'mind', which is perpetuating our inability to separate our true selves from our thoughts and which disallows us from achieving self-realization (some might argue self-realization as being the reason for being alive). We are seduced into believing ourselves to be our thoughts about the world and our thoughts about who we
       <em>
        think
       </em>
       we are, which is almost always coming from someone else who is telling us who we are or who we need to be -- thus, we are attached to the external world, as we're groomed to be via culture and the perpetual bullshit noise put out by the mainstream world.
      </p>
      <p>
       We are spiritual beings having a human experience, but this reality has been cleverly inverted by TPTB and the majority fundamentally believes that we are human beings having a materialistic experience, which is the only sort of experience people find fathomable. It is such a shit show.

       Maybe we should talk about how stuff that happens on reddit is a waste of space. Why should I care if someone got banned from the_donald or /politics. It feels like amateur hour when people complain about this type of shit, there are bigger fish to fry. Namely how our government in the US is currently disarming our civil liberties and trying to turn your town into a police state.

       Saturn. I can't get over how weird the hexagon storm is. The Star of David has a hexagon in the middle of it. Saturn is the sixth planet from the sun, and Saturday is the sixth day of the week. Saturday is the Jewish day of worship. Is this all just a big coincidence? Even the small caps that Jewish people wear remind me of the hexagon storm "capping" the North Pole of Saturn. The roman festival the eventually became Christmas was called Saturnalia. Is it somehow possible that ancient people were aware of the hexagon storm long before we had pictures of it? I've seen more about black cubes and wedding rings being a tribute to Saturn and I want to know more. We had a round table on space anomalies, but I think the whole cult of Saturn thing deserves its own thread.

       Out of Body Experience, transcendental meditation, psychedelics, non-physical realities, astral travel, lucid dreaming and other esoteric techniques of this vessel.
      </p>
      <p>
       Authors and videos to watch and discus:
      </p>
      <p>
       Tom Campbell (author of My Big T.O.E. 'Theory of Everything") who uses no psychedelics to achieve out of body states and visits these realms.  In specific, this part of this video shows a crude map of the places he's seen:
       <a href="https://youtu.be/y7-ZYAMFucc?t=3m14s">
        https://youtu.be/y7-ZYAMFucc?t=3m14s
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       He visited the Monroe Institute (famed for coining the term Out of Body) a long time ago, and through transcendental meditation achieves these goals.  He claims he dreams with his son and carries out conversations with all manner of sentience.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are many other authors with many other thoughts on this.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example Graham Hancock and specifically, his book Supernatural.  He discusses how humans throughout history have taken psychedelics (for many purposes) and that other planes exist.  He states in the book that there is another (or several) race evolving along side ours in their realm.  He claims they were once the elves/fairies, who now have become the greys etc.  Regardless of his conclusions, the book has nice facts about psychedelics and other realms.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another example is Terence McKenna and all he has to offer in regards to other states of mind, and other places of existence.  Realms of indirect lighting, geometric domes, self-transforming machine-elves with no faces who are making objects by singing them into being.

        https://youtu.be/Eqn5FKISlTw
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Another example is Rick Strassman and his book, DMT, The Spirit Molecule:
       <a href="https://www.rickstrassman.com/">
        https://www.rickstrassman.com/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Other topics to discuss within this field are personal experiences through meditation or talks about DMT, psilocybin and other psychedelics.  I could share (they are easily available for anyone to search) an extremely easy tek for making DMT crystals.  A 10 minute trip to dissolve all that you know.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm suggesting a topic along these lines because it empowers us as individuals.  Knowing MKUltra or 5G towers and all these all phenomenal topics are also great, but in my opinion, focusing on the self and transforming our selves from within is most important in these times.

       <pre><code>orbital ring space elevator project... Don't know much about the idea, but how exactly would it add tens of trillions to the economy?

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Briefly (I could talk abou it for hours), by putting large solar power generating capacity into orbit (that's why launching stuff up to LEO/GEO almost for free is needed) which will raise the energy throughput of the economy. Imagine 20% plus GDP growth. Plus asteroid mining you mentioned etc.

      <p>
       Nah, not wrong. For example, Trump wanted Flynn as VP at that time, had to accept Pence. Dismissing all he said based on this "failed" "prediction" would be shortsighted, IMO.

       As to CF? He claims they were involved with taking down the USSR, let me get the quotes for you:
      </p>
      <p>
       "Clinton is the one that walked back all the promises of US financial aid to Russia. FDR promised Stalin at Yalta that the US would act as the global infrastructure bank if Stalin conceded to US reserve currency. He was stabbed in back and they repeated the same thing a few decades later to get USSR to willingly dissolve. "
      </p>
      <p>
       "The Clintons were primarily involved on the domestic cocaine distribution networks that sent cash to Russia to buy off the mob, party leaders, etc., which facilitated a buying up of Russian assets. They made money both from skimming CIA cocaine profits and crony deals in buying up Russian assets after the USSR. "
