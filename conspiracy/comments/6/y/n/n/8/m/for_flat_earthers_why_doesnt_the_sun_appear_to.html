        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I often see flat earthers cite &quot;perspective&quot; as the reason the sun appears to set as it moves overhead above the surface. Ignoring the other problems with this, why doesn&#39;t the sun appear to track differently in the sky at different times?</p>

<p>Keep in mind other objects do change in their angular speed as they move towards and away an observer.</p>

<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/JoeJZfL.jpg">Here is a simple diagram showing how this works.</a>.</p>

<p>We have an observer O looking up at an object as it moves from point A to B... to I at a constant speed of 3 units per second to the right.</p>

<p>When O is looking straight above to point E, we&#39;ll say that&#39;s 0 degrees.</p>

<p><strong>Point A, time=0 seconds:</strong>
O is looking 12 units to the left and 6 units up. That&#39;s an angle of arctan(12/6)=63.43 degrees to the left.</p>

<p><strong>Point B, time=1 second:</strong>
O is looking 9 units to the left and 6 units up. That&#39;s an angle of arctan(9/6)=56.31 degrees. In the past second, the angle has changed by <strong>7.12 degrees</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Point C, time=2 seconds:</strong>
O is looking 6 units to the left and 6 units up. That&#39;s an angle of arctan(6/6)=45 degrees. In the past second, the angle has changed by <strong>11.1 degrees</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Point D, time=3 seconds:</strong>
O is looking 3 units to the left and 6 units up. That&#39;s an angle of arctan(3/6)=26.57 degrees. In the past second, the angle has changed by <strong>18.43 degrees</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Point E, time=4 seconds:</strong>
O is looking 6 units up. That&#39;s an angle of 0 degrees. In the past second, the angle has changed by <strong>26.57 degrees</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Point F, time=3 seconds:</strong>
O is looking 3 units to the right and 6 units up. That&#39;s an angle of arctan(3/6)=26.57 degrees to the right. In the past second, the angle has changed by <strong>26.57 degrees</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Point G, time=6 seconds:</strong>
O is looking 6 units to the right and 6 units up. That&#39;s an angle of arctan(6/6)=45 degrees. In the past second, the angle has changed by <strong>18.43 degrees</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Point H, time=7 seconds:</strong>
O is looking 9 units to the left and 6 units up. That&#39;s an angle of arctan(9/6)=56.31 degrees. In the past second, the angle has changed by <strong>11.1 degrees</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Point I, time=8 seconds:</strong>
O is looking 12 units to the right and 6 units up. That&#39;s an angle of arctan(12/6)=63.43 degrees. In the past second, the angle has changed by <strong>7.12 degrees</strong>.</p>

<p>The angular speed changed quite a bit as the object passed by. You can observe this by watching a car pass by you; you will need to turn your head very quickly to follow it when it&#39;s close, and more slowly when it is far away, even if it&#39;s driving at a constant speed. In addition, multiple viewer at different points along the road will see the car as moving at different angular speeds at the same exact time, say, if it&#39;s whizzing right by one viewer while another is farther away.</p>

<p>Why is the sun not affected by this?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That doesn&#39;t explain this effect. If the sun is as close as the supposed firmament is, it can&#39;t appear to move with a constant angular rate for viewers in different places at the same time.</p>

<p>I think the usual flat earth model is that the sun moves like <a href="https://i.imgur.com/vmRkea3.jpg">this</a>. &quot;Firmament&quot; not shown but you can see how it&#39;s there.</p>

<p>On any given day the sun would appear to move in a circle from east to west. Over the year it allegedly changes in altitude tracing circles at different heights on the &quot;dome&quot; but on any given day it&#39;s at a single height.</p>

<p>For example on the equinox (March 21st/September 23rd or thereabouts) the Sun moves in a circle from east to west overhead the equator, tracing a circle on the alleged firmament overhead.</p>

<p>Now we&#39;re back to the question I posted: as it moves from east to west, viewers should see its apparent motion change in angular speed. Why doesn&#39;t it?</p>

<p>Not relevant to the question. I&#39;m talking about observations of where the sun appears to be in the sky. Two observers who are some distance apart from each other east/west would observe the sun moving at a different rate if it were actually moving by close overhead. They don&#39;t. Why?</p>

<p>Already showed you with your picture. </p>

<p>Like I said I&#39;m only guessing. I don&#39;t know the exact shape. I just know the lack of any legitimate photos of this so called globe, no detectable curve, and the fact you cannot travel around it heading north/south makes me seriously question the validity of the theory. </p>

<p>Ok, your picture seems to match what happens in a globe earth (heliocentric or geocentric will be the same in this case).</p>

<p>But on a flat earth, where the sun is still over the earth somewhere (since it must be noon somewhere when it&#39;s setting where you are)... how does this happen?</p>

<p>You are saying that the sun arcs over someone and actually changes in altitude. Why then can one person see the sun as overhead (noon) while a second person farther away can see it as lower in the sky (sunset)? Is it low or high?</p>

<p>Fortunately you can prove it in other ways. I have done this with <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6yb5im/predicting_the_moons_inclination_from_different/">viewing angles of the Moon</a> for example, taken <em>at the same time</em> from multiple places. On a flat Earth, the results are impossible. On a round Earth, they match up perfectly.</p>

<p>And there are photos of Earth taken from space everyday, but you will dismiss them all as CGI I&#39;m sure.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>but your diagram is all straight lines.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, because in the supposed flat earth model I linked, on any given day the sun traces a circle above the earth. So from individual viewer&#39;s perspective they will see it going by overhead from east to west. For example at one point it will be far away, just barely visible to them. Then at midday it will be closer, and appear to move at a greater angular rate. Then late in the day it will be farther again and appear to move at a slower angular rate again.</p>

<p>Whether it&#39;s moving in a straight line or not, it should appear to be moving faster when it&#39;s closer. Consider a car driving by, even if it&#39;s going around a curve as an observer watches from the corner. They will need to turn their head faster to keep up with it when it&#39;s closer to them. You&#39;ve seen this loads of times I&#39;m sure, think of anytime you&#39;ve passed by something in a car or had a car pass by you.</p>

<p>I agree with that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What assumptions? I&#39;m only using the flat earth assumption that the sun is relatively close on some firmament overhead, and showing that it would need to appear to move at different rates at different times.</p>

<p>You can&#39;t easily percieve the sun&#39;s movement from second to second, but you can easily check for yourself by measuring its change in angle from hour to hour. Geometrically, if it&#39;s closer at some hours than others it should change angles more in some hours than others, say, from 12:00 to 1:00 and then from 5:00 to 6:00 should have very different results.</p>

<p>But it doesn&#39;t, and you can look up <a href="http://suncalc.net/">tables of the sun&#39;s movement</a> and compare with your own observations if you don&#39;t believe me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because of basic geometry...? If an object is moving at some speed past an observer (like the sun moving overhead) it will appear to move at a faster rate when it&#39;s closer to them (like directly overhead) compared to when it&#39;s farther from them (overhead+to the east or west some distance like when it&#39;s setting or rising).</p>

<p>You can observe this with airplanes, cars, trains, anything moving past you. Why does the sun not show the same behavior?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, a snail would be subject to the same effect. You can measure the sun&#39;s angular difference hour by hour and see for yourself that this doesn&#39;t happen to it though.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why does it sound like BS? Use some basic geometry to see that, whatever the speed is, the angular rate will change as the object passes by the observer. The actual angular rate will depend on how fast the object is moving, but the fact that it changes does not.</p>

<p>In the established model, the sunrise and sunset is caused by the Earth rotating, not it&#39;s revolution around the sun.</p>

<p>It <em>is</em> possible for a stationary object to appear to move with a constant angular rate from the view of an observer that is rotating at a constant angular rate.</p>

<p>If you sit in a chair and spin, you will see the objects around you appear to move steadily (if you are spinning steadily).</p>

<p>But if you are stationary and something is moving past you, its angular rate in your view will change as it gets closer.</p>

<p>When we observe the sun, it moves at a constant angular rate from hour to hour.</p>

<p>How does the flat Earth explain this?</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

<p>Not in any significant way. The Earth is 6371 km in radius, so that&#39;s the most you get closer/farther from the sun while it&#39;s visible.</p>

<p>The sun is about 150 MILLION km away.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>so obviously it does not work on either model.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You are admitting that it does not work in the flat earth model then correct?</p>

<p>I believe I have just shown that it still works in the round Earth based on the obscene difference in the distance vs. the amount the Earth&#39;s rotation moves. Compare this with the relative change in distance in the flat earth. In the flat Earth it&#39;s often said the Sun is about 6000 km above an Earth that is about 12000 km wide... so it actually moves farther side to side than it is up. Contrast with what I&#39;ve just said, where you move about 0.004% of the distance to the Sun over the course of the daylight hours.</p>

<p>I can prove it with some calculations if you so desire.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Which part am I bending, exactly? I am saying that:</p>

<p>1) the Sun appears to move at a constant angular rate in the sky</p>

<p>2) if the Sun were moving overhead as in a flat Earth model it would not do this (basic trig/geometry)</p>

<p>3) a rotating observer can see things around him rotating at the same constant rate.</p>

<p>4) the distance the Earth&#39;s rotation moves the observer is absurdly tiny compared to the distance to the Sun.</p>

<p>You seem to have accepted #1, agreed with #2 and #3, do you think the effects of #4 would be significant? I can show you that it&#39;s not if you want.</p>

<p>It would be like expecting the angular rate of objects viewed while spinning in a chair to change because you tilted your head a fraction of a milimeter while you were spinning.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t trust these things for myself, I&#39;ve been fortunate to confirm the Earth is round with experiments (using the Moon, but a similar principle) as part of my job.</p>
