       So basically I'm at a bar and some guy comes over and starts talking politics (I try to avoid that but whatever), kind of out of nowhere he tells me that the Jews are responsible to communism and they created it so they could control both the capitalistic and socialistic world.  I'm honestly really fucking confused by this one.  I know that traditionally Jews ran the banks so the "controlling capitalism" piece makes sense but is there any mass conspiracy thing about any jewish movement involving Communism?

       Lots of USSR higher ups were jews. Of course to anyone who actually understands the context of tsarist russia. Jews were regularly persecuted by the russians (who also invented the protocols of the elders of zion)
      </p>
      <p>
       But you have the nonsense in one. Why control both then make sure the USSR fails (which was far more controllong than capitalist countries overall)

       Not a single historian that I have seen so far supports it's authenticity. Now when this is said people can claim they are also part of jewish propaganda. But this is ludicrous as it means you are claiming every single historian is completely blinded somehow

       You must not be looking very hard. These are some examples of people who argue that it is authentic:
      </p>
      <p>
       Ivan Fraser‘s Proofs of an Ancient Conspiracy, Henry Makow‘s Protocol Forgery Arguments Are Flawed, Paquita de Shishmareff‘s Waters Flowing Eastward and Peter Myers Protocols of Zion Toolkit.
      </p>
      <p>
       And many more where that came from. They may not qualify as "Historians" to you, but then again I have a feeling that anyone who believes that the Protocols are authentic would not qualify for that title in the minds of many. Its a bit of a Catch-22.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also think that you shouldn't forget that you are posting in a r/conspiracy sub. With that in mind, I think its a little silly to say that the Establishment "experts" have declared it to be a hoax, therefore it must be a hoax.

       I mean, if you're really interested in knowing, then you could always start you quest for knowledge at Karl Marx (jew), and Moses Hess (jew).  Work your way forward from there, come back to r/conspiracy and tell everyone what you've found.

       The leaders of the Bolshevik movement were something like 90% Jewish. The philosophers behind Communism were mostly Jewish. Based on the Talmud, it seems likely that its followers would want "Communism" for the goyim, while the Jews administrate this Communist One World Government (ie. the Jews will rule the unwashed goyim masses who are all treated equally, like slaves). That is more or less the conspiracy as I understand it.

       socialism began in our country, the US, and it was not jewish at all. jews did not begin to become associated with jews here until after WW2....with HUAC and hollywood. "communist" did not become a widespread appellation until the flood of eastern europeans between 1900 and 1920. this is because americans and western europeans, esp UK and france had always used socialism.
      </p>
      <p>
       hollywood jews in particular were targetted by HUAC because they used "communist" not  "socialist," were unpopular, came from what became the USSR. HUAC ignored actors and actresses like catherine hepburn, a loud mouthed yankee socialist from a family of loud mouthed new england socialists.
      </p>
      <p>
       why did socialism begin here? because mature, exploitive, rapacious, industrial capitalism was our baby. our workers from west virginian coal miners to detroit auto workers to dust bowel oakie refugees in the california groves to cloth mills in north carolina to sweatshops in NYC were exploited to levels that we can't understand, because of their struggle. the difference btwn us and them, we are ignorant, gullible, cowards. if you buy the bullshit about evil communism, you're not only not woke, you're a true believer.
      </p>
      <p>
       the most famous, beloved by conspiracists socialist? orwell

       second most famous, beloved by conspiracist socialist? huxley

       third most famous, beloved by average people socialist? dickens
      </p>
      <p>
       every book he wrote but a tale of two cities was a screed against capitalism. a christmas carol is his most explicit condemnation against capitalism and esp the bourgeoisie collaborators. rapacious british capitalism even bares his name, dickensian. london followed close on our heels regarding the ascendency of capitalism.
      </p>
      <p>
       the cognitive dissonance of people who believe the richest, oldest banking family, without whom capitalism could not flourish, who are eye of the illuminati hurricane, are known jews, would allow anti-capitalists to have any power, is absurd.

       i shouldn't have to say it but 'm not jewish. no one in my family has been jewish, and i know my pedigree going back to 1580. i'm a direct descendent of the howards in england and the last landed irish aristocrats, who were central to the formation of the united irishmen and for whom the phrase "beyond the pale" was coined. but i guess I've just outted my centuries long association with strong anti-reformation families...so i guess i'm a roman catholic atheist and thus untrustworthy.

       That doesn't matter. Many jews in many countries were also socialists.

       wrong the made up 60 percent of leadership roles in the Bolshevik movement. They only made up 10 percent of the total population of Russia.

       Winston Churchill quote:
      </p>
      <p>
       "From the days of Spartacus-Weishaupt to those of Karl Marx, and down to Trotsky (Russia), Bela Kun (Hungary), Rosa Luxemburg (Germany), and Emma Goldman (United States), this world-wide revolutionary conspiracy for the overthrow of civilization and for the reconstitution of society on the basis of arrested development, of envious malevolence, and impossible equality, has been steadily growing.
      </p>
      <p>
       It played, as a modern writer, Mrs. Webster has ably shown, a definite recognizable part in the tragedy of the French Revolution.
      </p>
      <p>
       It has been the mainspring of every subversive movement during the Nineteenth Century; and now at last this band of extraordinary personalities from the underworlds of the great cities of Europe and America have gripped the Russian people by the hair of their heads and have become practically the undisputed masters of the enormous empire.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is no need to exaggerate the part played in the creating of Bolshevism and in the actual bringing about of the Russian Revolution by these international and for the most part atheistic Jews."

       Look deeper, OP, and start with the pioneer of communism, a totally synthetic ideology:
       <a href="http://postflaviana.org/wolfgang-waldner-marx/">
        Karl Marx
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       "Upon his arrival in England, Karl Marx joined a partnership with David Urquhart, an agent of the British crown, and they became involved in agitation against Russia, which was threatening the global interests of the British."
      </p>
      <p>
       "In the 19th century, a fierce resistance to the impoverishment of the masses by the capitalist industrialization developed. Autocrats, government officials, industrialists and bankers were afraid because of strikes and violent resistance to the attacks of the anarchists. But when
       <em>
        Marx and Engels took over the communists’ ideological leadership
       </em>
       , the revolutionaries became  peaceful, with value-form analysis employed instead of dynamite. The fight against the anarchists was Marx’s main concern in the First International."
      </p>
      <p>
       "Marx and Engels’ theories were no threat to England or capitalism. On the contrary, Liberal ideas could have led to the rise of capitalism in Russia, which would have been a real threat to the Empire. A totalitarian party dictatorship of “Marxists” in the name of the proletariat would hold Russia backwards and isolated from Western Europe. Whereas, England feared nothing more than the prospect of  an alliance of France, or even Germany, with a Russian liberal capitalism."
      </p>
      <p>
       "The slogan of the world proletarian revolution sounded horrifying to the ears of all the petty bourgeois. Nobility and big business enjoyed a hearty laugh at the good disguise their agents."
      </p>
      <p>
       etc.

       This Jewish-Communist conspiracy should be treated the same way you treat you treat Flat Earth.  Look at them awkwardly and back away.  None of them have read any socialist writers or studied the history of the Russian Revolution.  Just like Flat Earthers don't even know highschool physics.
