       Some comments:

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        It has Russia and Trump in the headline and it sounds salacious. It's like free karma. People will upvote anything.
       </p>
       <p>
        But Trump in the headline, + the indication that he somehow has ties to these Russians = upvotes
       </p>
       <p>
        Articles like this almost make it seem like the entire Russia-Trump connection is just fake-news. ...even if it's real.
       </p>
       <p>
        If it were real the media wouldn't need to mislead people like this.
       </p>
       <p>
        (something something) Trump (something something) Russians. Is it collusion? Is this a sign of a deeper conspiracy? Click here to find out!
       </p>
       <p>
        The article would have never been written or published unless it could propagate a politically biased agenda.
       </p>
       <p>
        That's the most click bait sounding title I have ever heard
       </p>
       <p>
        Literally checking off a check list. Trump, check. Russians, check. Immigration, check. Evil capitalists spending lots of money, check. There's no way this wasn't going to end up all over the front page.
       </p>
       <p>
        When this exact same thing was criticised under the Obama administration, immigrants giving birth to their children in the United States to secure citizenship, it was called racist and completely dismissed as bigotry. I don't like to take hard stances on complex issues like immigration, but this article is garbage.
       </p>
       <p>
        I honestly thought this was a Subreddit Simulator post at first.
       </p>
       <p>
        If you tell a lie enough times some people start believing it.
       </p>
       <p>
        What a bullshit non-News article. Rich people in general can do this, not just Russians. As long as its legal, who gives a fuck? This has little or no relation to the issue of illegal immigration from down South.
       </p>
       <p>
        This is really confusing
       </p>
       <p>
        Also confusing, is why this is showing up so high on my front page with just 126 up votes? Edit: Oh look, it jumped to 1400 in less than an hour.
       </p>
       <p>
        You put "russians" and "trump" in the post title and it can't fail.
       </p>
       <p>
        Smells like Reddit or corporate interference
       </p>
       <p>
        This is such a retarded post. As long a baby is born ANYWHERE in the U.S. they're a citizen. Cringey click bait.
       </p>
       <p>
        Daily Beast, in a major news sub. Whoever up votes source like this, especially on rediculous stories like this, is an idiot.
       </p>
       <p>
        who writes this bullshit?
       </p>
       <p>
        On the front page after an hour with only 15 votes but somehow over a hundred comments?
       </p>
       <p>
        God what a pathetic jab at Donald Trump
       </p>
       <p>
        This is not world news. This is another Trump smear piece. Keep this garbage in your circle jerk sub and not worldnews please, thanks.
       </p>
       <p>
        This is Russian paranoia at it's finest.
       </p>
       <p>
        Who upvoted this garbage? Dumb stuff like this is a detriment to actual criticism against Trump.
       </p>
       <p>
        RUSSIA + TRUMP = UPBOATS

       see it for what it is: propaganda and drivel.

       I was going to comment when I saw your post earlier to tell you that this subreddit is now the wrong place to post this, because people are going to continue the r/"politics" circlejerk and call the story true because it is against Trump.

       No. I don't know if it's bogus or not. Chances are it's not, people travel to America every fucking day. Many of them come here specifically to have anchor babies. That doesn't mean I'm willing to state, 100%, that the article is not bogus. Give me evidence.

      <p>
       The implication being Trump sought after these people to help them have anchor babies? Because, if not, then he's not a hypocrite. He rents properties. People pay them and they come here.
      </p>
      <p>
       If he
       <em>
        didn't
       </em>
       allow people to rent from his properties, you'd claim he was racist. He'd also be in jail because you cannot discriminate base on a protected class (which race and nation of origin are).

       And that's not proof of your claim. He doesn't say it's okay for anyone else. In fact, he is only using Mexico as an example because they are the most common.

      <p>
       Again, find me where he says it's okay for light skinned people to have anchor babies. Without that your claim is not fact but mere opinion.

       You said he was a hypocrite because he's seemingly okay with Russians having anchor babies, but not Mexicans. So, in order for that to be verifiable, you'll have to have evidence. The only evidence you can muster is that he mentioned Mexico in one interview where he talked about anchor babies.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/the-anchor-baby-question-at-the-g-o-p-debate">
        Here's some evidence
       </a>
       , from the debate, where he clearly mentions
       <em>
        everybody
       </em>
       and not just Mexico.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        It's disgusting what's happening to our country. We are a dumping ground for the rest of the world
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/634725641972248576">
        Here
       </a>
       he is again talking about "illegal immigrants" and not mentioning
       <em>
        only
       </em>
       dark people.
      </p>
      <p>
       So clearly, the claim you're making is not true. I have provided evidence that he views the anchor baby as bigger than just Mexico. You have not been able to provide evidence of him being a hypocrite (okay for light skinned people, not okay for dark skinned people).

       Duder what part of I'm not trying to argue with your strawman don't you get.
      </p>
      <p>
       I stated he only singled out by name specific places that all have something in common.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's just a fucking fact that you can't refute.

      <p>
       My opinion is trump is dog whistling to racists when he singled those places out.
      </p>
      <p>
       So like switch to refuting the fact about who he singled out and if you can't at least refute my opinion in the dog whistling but don't just make up a straw man to topple down. Be better.

       You found one instance where he mentioned Mexico. Hell, you even said that's the only thing you could find. So "places" is inaccurate.

       I did refute it. You found me one instance where he mentioned Mexico, and I found you two where he said the problem was
       <em>
        everybody
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       You are focusing on one fucking interview where he talked about anchor babies while saying the word "Mexico". You're ignoring all the other times he mentioned the whole world.
      </p>
      <p>
       This point you're making
       <em>
        now
       </em>
       has literally nothing to do with him being a hypocrite, though, and that was the original point you were making. It was
       <em>
        you
       </em>
       who side tracked us down this path.
      </p>
      <p>
       I asked earlier but you couldn't provide me evidence. I'll ask again. Please find me proof where Trump is actively helping light skinned people come to America and have babies. That's what would be needed to show he's a hypocrite. Either that or show me a time where he singled a nation that he believes is
       <em>
        okay
       </em>
       to come here and have anchor babies.
      </p>
      <blockquote>

       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       There's nothing to refute because I refuse the blanket statement that anyone who is worried about Mexico is a racist. That you seemingly think that just shows your lack of understanding of what it means to be a poor American in the south, and especially in border states.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is he dog whistling his support base when he mentions Mexico? Maybe. But, as I said, I reject the idea that anyone who is worried about illegal immigration, or anchor babies, is racist.

       It wasn't until much later on you brought up the whole "singled out" point. It is cute, however, that when I disproved all those claims above you switched to "muh strawman" though. C for effort.

       The fact that Reddit is a liberal hivemind torture chamber is no mystery to anyone who frequents Reddit.  The fact you're claiming that the show b doesn't belong to someone is proof that you're here to push some good awful agenda.

       I was here to preserve a place for Conspiracy theorists that isn't coopted by liberal propagandists.  I failed, congratulations but I would stop short of quantifying anything I've done as a bitch fit less you be served a doe of reality that you aren't capable of consuming.

       And you sperging out every chance you get because you didn't get mods to fall into line they way you wanted is exactly what a bitch fit is. More than half of the mods still lean "conservative" by Reddit standards.

       If Trump hadn't been taking the positions he has on immigration and anchor babies, and hadn't been such a polarizing figure I doubt anyone would care.
      </p>
      <p>
       Personally, I'm not outraged by this story because I think it's very plausible that Trump had no first hand knowledge of this taking place. But on the flip side of that argument..... For as much rhetoric as Trump puts out in regards to this issue, he obviously didn't perform due diligence in making sure his own backyard was clean, and knowing what we know about Trump his moral compass is his bank account......... I'd have serious doubts that he would have made an effort to prevent this from happening if he did know it was taking place.
      </p>
      <p>
       The guy is using immigration and anchor babies as a political tool, meanwhile his properties are being used to create anchor babies. The media and the public hates a hypocrite.

       No trump cries about it all the time. Maybe some folks would just be curious why he doesn't see a problem with Russians doing it and just singled out people that look way different than him.

       How do you know he doesn't see a problem with birth tourism? Singling out rich Russians is absolutely idiotic when so many other countries do it at a larger scale. This is more fake news for the "muh russianz" narrative.

       Education belongs at state and local level, not federal level. But yeah, blame the evil boogeymen GOP. If it weren't for them, everyone could get free shitty healthcare, free shitty education, maybe a universal income, and a country in $50T in debt instead of $20T that would implode in less than 10 years.

       Clickbait =/= Fake News
      </p>
      <p>
       Clickbait is when the publisher lies to get people to read a story. The story itself can still be true and have nothing but accurate facts and statements, but the title/image just has to put emphasis on something that's barely touched on, isn't in the story, or spins something to push their own interpretation on it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fake News is when the story itself, regardless of how it's presented, is based on a lie. If the source isn't true, if there's a quote that wasn't made, or if it's just pure speculation disguised as a news piece.
      </p>
      <p>
       A misrepresented story is not the same as an untrue story.

       Weird how every time one side gets called out by the community it's vote manipulation.

       Seems like a pretty desperate last resort to try to defend a turd of a post.

       Lmao. You and your kind are paranoid beyond belief.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only contribution you are making is to call out people for brigading.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think the community should get a vote on this as a new rule.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you accuse people of brigading you should have proof and if all you do is say "i disagree with the sentiment here it's brigading" the post should be deleted and the user warned.
      </p>
      <p>
       It adds nothing to any conversation and serves only to slide the forum.
      </p>
      <p>
       Make brigading accusation a rule 10 violation.

       I realize that the purpose for their "methadone clinic" for conspiracy theorist is to turn the conspiracy sub into commenters like you, who do not provide but just devalue and berate other users. Ultimately turning this sub into conspiratard or Top Minds.

       In this thread if you even fucking know what the topic was about I have been pointing out the relevance of trump seeming to cry out in horror about Mexicans and Chinese doing birth tourism but hypocritically leaving Russians out of the mix.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is it an indication that he hates people who have dark skin or don't look like him, is it an indication he doesn't want to ruffle any Russian feathers, if so, why?

       Did he leave Russians out of the mix? Do we know this based on a fucking dailybeast article. Is that the end all fucking be all for you? That was enough? Hell, today is the first I've heard of Russian birth tourism. Hell they didn't even want us to adopt their fucking kids two years ago.

       I disagree with your hyperbolic, vitriolic, screeching and acting as if cussing users and calling them deluded and crazy is winning an internet argument and proving your worth as a legitimate conspiracy user compared to all the other users who actually engage in discussions.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't have to prove you a brigader, I can't do that. It's too easy to make fake profiles and use one on top minds and the other on conspiracy. I can just pay attention to what I can, when the brigades are listed and wait for the loudest ones to show up :) and you're pretty loud, and usually make it a point to spam comment and bitch at a lot of users.

       Maybe you're are just really really angry though, I haven't figure it out.

       What are the respective numbers between the Russian, Chinese, and Mexico? I feel that would help put into perspective what we are dealing with and give us some indication of why this particular issue hasn't been discussed. Because I can find way more articles over it leaning towards Chinese and Mexico that go back to at least 2010, that article you have is from 2014 (already read it, to prepare for you to post the only example readily available).

       I do enjoy how comfortable you are posting Russian links though lol. You know that state sponsored propaganda.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do those numbers deserve to come into play or is this a situation of what "is" compared to what "ought to be"?

       I'm not going to, because I already did. That's the whole point of conspiracy discussion. They don't track the birth tourism, they can only track the visas. So how legitimate is your link from a Russian news source providing the numbers? However there are 30 birthing hotels for the Chinese in

       like it's big business, so I can't wait to start getting into the recent numbers :)

       And I will keep searching, because actually facts are so much more interesting than hyperbolic talking points.

       I think you've said before like many others, that he hasn't accomplished a single thing this year. Especially regarding immigration. I have theories for that, but that's an argument for another time.

       So that was a long winded way of saying you have no stats but my source was bogus. Ok. I think we agree that trump should speak out on Russian birth tourism since he made it an issue for other nations so in actuality we agree completely trump should not be a hypocrite ESPECIALLY when it comes to Russia.

       40-60 a month, how does that compare to the other two, now find the numbers for China and Mexico and then we discover if this is an issue we should be taking to the streets and acting like assholes over. Instead of just acting on our feelings about the article, one from Thedailybeast and one from Moscow Times.

       Gentle readers,
      </p>
      <p>
       This post has been X-posted to Top Minds of Reddit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Pay attention to how this gets brigaded and how user's are justifying their karma score in a brigaded post.
      </p>
      <p>
       They want to sub destroyed, so pay attention to the rhetoric and tactics that are used. Pay attention to the cyclical nature of their conversations and how they will spout how Trump supporters are brigading, but just read the upvotes for the tale of the tape, then compare it to posts that aren't brigaded.

       How does cross posting controversial posts into subreddits where users are dedicated to making fun of said sub, in a website where it is incredibly easy to make an account 14 days ago and start brigading any topic that is mentioned there not point to anything other than a possibility of brigading.

      <p>
       "No trump cries about it all the time. Maybe some folks would just be curious why he doesn't see a problem with Russians doing it and just singled out people that look way different than him"
      </p>
      <p>
       When I pointed out just now that NPR covered birth tourism back in 2010. I do agree with you that he should speak out against Russian birth tourism since the only reason they do it is for dual citizenship and get this, (you might get a kick out of this one) The Healthcare lmao.
      </p>
      <p>
       If this has been an ongoing issue, why hasn't anyone looked into it. It might be because it is wealthy Russians making use of the service. And wealthy people seem to be able to afford not to get messed with in our country.

       Shills / brigading is now something of a conspiracy in itself and I find the concept interesting to monitor. You won't notice my other comments or posts (because of the outrage).

       I used to like this sub when it had actual conspiracies.
      </p>
      <p>
       IMHO there should be a rule that if there are selfies on instagram supporting the story then its not really a conspiracy at all.

       You got me on that one pal. I can't say I ever cared before, I've been aware and frankly thought it was a sweet loophole, but didn't care at all. But now, hey if there needs to be an examination of how that works and needs modification why the hell not.
      </p>
      <p>
       But let's be consistent. And this is the part you won't like and accuse me of being a shill or troll or brigadier:

       You have to understand the subtext of trumps decisions. I hate him obviously but will never say again he is stupid or lost and in over his head. In my best current memory of the famous words of little Marco "let's not fool ourselves into thinking he doesn't know what he is doing he knows exactly what he is doing. " or something along those lines.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump is deliberate in his choices, he engages in the art of dog whistling better than anyone ever has and he pushes it right to the extreme and just shrugs it off. Trump knows what is going to get him ratings. Trump knows what could damn well be a great shot at getting re elected but his only shot.
      </p>
      <p>
       So when trump makes a big deal about Mexicans and Chinese taking advantage like this he knows exactly the kind of person who is going to feel very strongly against "chinks and spics" it fires up up for America first trump and it's not a happy accident.
      </p>

       Just take race out for a second if you can. If no one cared about race at all if the whole world was white and minorities didn't exist - do you see any real legit reason that this would be an issue really all that worth mentioning at all, like maybe for reasons stated above but in all honesty with all the issues out there would this really be any kind of priority or come up? I just doubt it and you can disagree with that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Tldr - trump plays to his audience always, not a stupid guy, master dog whistler.

       Do you think level of education completed, regardless of quality or subject of study, directly corresponds to one's intelligence? Lots of "educated" people with worthless degrees that aren't very intelligent.

       How does cross posting controversial posts into subreddits where users are dedicated to making fun of said sub, in a website where it is incredibly easy to make an account 14 days ago and start brigading any topic that is mentioned there not point to anything other than a possibility of brigading.
      </p>
      <p>
       We would assume the same if they were cross posted in The Donald. You just really want to make me seem crazy :)

       Why don't you go research all that then take a rest you've had a busy day. Then explain why you think he singled out those countries and conveniently ignored Russia.

       I could also add that the article link I posted States there are 40-60 Russian births in Miami alone every month. That's more than one ruskie a day getting dual citizenship in Miami alone.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        I stated he only singled out by name specific places that all have something in common.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       You found one instance where he mentioned Mexico. Hell, you even said that's the only thing you could find. So "places" is inaccurate.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        So like switch to refuting the fact about who he singled out
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I did refute it. You found me one instance where he mentioned Mexico, and I found you two where he said the problem was
       <em>
        everybody
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       You are focusing on one fucking interview where he talked about anchor babies while saying the word "Mexico". You're ignoring all the other times he mentioned the whole world.
      </p>
      <p>
       This point you're making
       <em>
        now
       </em>
       has literally nothing to do with him being a hypocrite, though, and that was the original point you were making. It was
       <em>
        you
       </em>
       who side tracked us down this path.
      </p>
      <p>
       I asked earlier but you couldn't provide me evidence. I'll ask again. Please find me proof where Trump is actively helping light skinned people come to America and have babies. That's what would be needed to show he's a hypocrite. Either that or show me a time where he singled a nation that he believes is
       <em>
        okay
       </em>
       to come here and have anchor babies.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        at least refute my opinion in the dog whistling
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       There's nothing to refute because I refuse the blanket statement that anyone who is worried about Mexico is a racist. That you seemingly think that just shows your lack of understanding of what it means to be a poor American in the south, and especially in border states.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is he dog whistling his support base when he mentions Mexico? Maybe. But, as I said, I reject the idea that anyone who is worried about illegal immigration, or anchor babies, is racist.
