       You are fairly obvious with your ban baiting here, but I am going to help you out a bit by getting you started on your way to understanding astroturfing in social media.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is plenty of evidence out there about astroturfing organizations. I have compiled a few links. There are a varied number of political groups, corporate entities and nation states conducting propaganda operations in social media, with the USA having the largest number of registered astroturfing organizations.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is a lot of info on the astroturfing organizations Correct the Record, ShareBlue and Media Matters. Their official mission statements that are publicly available state their intent to use propaganda for the DNC on the web and on social media such as Reddit, Facebook and Twitter. This implies the use of social community opinion management software and other tools.
      </p>

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        So we know how popular Sanders and his positions are, yet politics is showing numbers that should not exist considering the raw data we're looking at. His ideals should still be the super majority it was prior to the DNC convention, yet it's not, not by a longshot. Single payer is getting shut down as well, an issue that only the staunchest of neoliberals would be against, yet it seems to be the prevailing view in politics.

      <p>
       From this Oxford research paper on astroturfing:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        There is no doubt that individual social media users can spread hate speech, troll other users, or set up automated political communication campaigns. Unfortunately, this is also an organized phenomenon, with major governments and political parties dedicating significant resources towards the use of social media for public opinion manipulation.
       </p>
       <p>
        ... In many countries, political actors have no reported ability to field social media campaigns. In some countries, one or two known political actors occasionally use social media for political messaging, and in a few other countries there are multiple government agencies, political parties, or civil society groups organizing trolling and fake news campaigns.

       Where exactly is the OP "having a meltdown"? In that single comment where he made a couple edits after being gang-downvoted?

       I saw that comment. Still waiting on the proof of OP having a "meltdown".
      </p>
      <p>
       Or that comment having any relevance whatsoever to the validity of the headline.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or the fact that the "OP having a meltdown" comment you are defending was made by a person with a 3 year reddit account who has never once submitted a comment in this subreddit until right now.

       He had the "
       <em>
        mini
       </em>
       meltdown" in the comment. As you can read by his words he wrote. Yeah it's interesting that account has never commented here before, but I don't disagree with him. If you make a shit joke and get downvoted for it don't blame brigaders, shills and bots. They do exist, but so do people.
       <br/>
       What is curious though is how that account has slightly changed their posting habits recently and supposedly they've been posting comments every hour for the last 20 hours... That might be worth keeping tabs on... BUT in this particular instance I think OP is overacting.

       That's a bit of a mini meltdown. I think most people here would agree that there are shills and bots on reddit, but OP provides no new evidence that that is the case. Instead he has shown that he easily loses his cool. That's why people are skeptic towards OP.

       If you want to talk about shills and bots on reddit I suggest you write a post on the subject with some material to back it up.

       Yes, the subject is very fascinating. I'd like to see an extensive post about shills and bot. I'd love to read it if it contained some new material or if it was a compilation of older evidence and material in one single post. If that was the case we would have something to talk about. There would be something to base the discussion on.
      </p>
      <p>
       Right now all OP is saying is "There are bots and shills on reddit and I'm being downvoted for my unpopular opinions". The commenters here have agreed that bots and shills are indeed a problem, but suggested that OP might have been downvoted because of his arrogance and wild temperament. There is nothing else to discuss since OP haven't provided anymore information.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think there's anything else to miss. I agree that there bots and shills on reddit. Do you have any interesting informaion on the subject that you would like to share?
      </p>
      <p>
       Did you downvote me by the way? I find that a bit ironic and rude since you've expressed concern of being unfairly downvoted yourself. I think I've been polite.

       Everyone makes mistakes, everyone gets frustrated, and everyone has been massively downvoted on at least one occassion. not everyone refuses to accept when they are wrong, and proceeds to accuse everyone else of being simultaneously arrogant, delusional idiots, bots, and shills for not liking their comment.
      </p>
      <p>
       If I get pissed at someone and make a comment insulting them then that's on me, and if I get downvoted for it I might be mad as well, but I'm not going to insinuate that they are only downvoting me because they are bots, shills, or idiots who just don't get what I am saying. acting like that just shows a complete lack of self awareness.

       I'm not going to be answering your replies anymore. I thought you would drop the patronising manner after a while but you clearly have no intention of doing so. I asked what your favourite conspiracy theory was and you have yet to answer it. I'm sad we couldn't have a normal conversation rather than your weird little conspiracy level tester game. I am actually quite fond of conspiracy theories but it is because of people like you I have to resort to posting on other forums. You give conspiracy theorists a bad name.

       How would you know what gives a conspiracy theorist a bad name? Youre not a regular visitor here.  Your post history is very suspect, to stay the least.  In fact, in your post history, you use another users posting history in
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       as a weapon against them while posting in
       <a href="/r/gifs">
        /r/gifs
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       So I think I have successfully outed you and now the rest of the forum understands what and who you are.  Thank you for playing my game.  You lost.  You win no prizes.  Be sure to tell the rest of your group to come downvote me!

       You are a 2 month account being upvoted for calling OP a liar. Whats the lie exactly?

       How is the headline inaccurate?

       Are you trying to deny that reddit is full of bots and sponsored accounts. This is common knowledge.

       I fucking love seeing these shills get their shit handed to them by the community. They thought that getting all of us banned would stop us lol it has only provoked us more. Fuck the shills. Fuck the rules. They want to play dirty, that's cool. We'll handle them like we have been. They aren't wired like we are. These fucks are on our turf. Just imagine the millions of dollars getting thrown at us.. All wasted on us. Don't ever go quiet. Don't ever be censored. Get banned And create 15 more accounts. They want a war, let's give it to them.

       And yet he's a disaster for the establishment because he is a force to unite against. He's totally incompetent and it's a threat to the status quo, who have carefully maintained the two party system for decades.

       That's exactly what I said.
       <br/>
       He's a threat to the status quo because in his incompetence he reveals the corruption of the entire system. The last thing the elite want us for the people to understand the nature of their oppression. Trump makes it easy for us to unite against the system.

       Oh yeah, a republican candidate running for president as a member of the republican party, who's campaign was largely based on both espousing republican views and complaining about his democrat opponent, really 'shakes up' the two party system.

       ... I don't think you understand what I mean. But that's ok. I'm just saying Trump invites dissent, and that we have an opportunity to unite against him and the system he represents.

       same shit happens here, just on a different level.
      </p>
      <p>
       try talking about gyroscopes, and how they don't move.
      </p>
      <p>
       consider a gyroscope, which maintains its position in space irrespective of outside movement.
      </p>
      <p>
       then a gyroscope should move because the earth is moving, both spinning and moving in space.  yet it doesn't.  it remains stationary.
      </p>
      <p>
       schills attacked me at once with aviation gyroscopes, which they claim have to adjust for the curve of the earth.  i say that is a blackbox that i can't investigate, and irrelevant to a stationary gyroscope on the ground, it should spin, if the earth were spinning, but is apparently not.
