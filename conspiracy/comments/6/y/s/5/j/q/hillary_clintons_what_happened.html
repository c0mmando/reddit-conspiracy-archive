        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Let me explain.  You and members of the DNC sabotaged the Democratic primary, and belittled 45% of your voter base in the process.  You were so out of touch and arrogant in your belief that everyone would vote for your nominee based on the simplified strategy that you weren&#39;t Trump.  While Sanders is still out there fighting for a living wage, medicare for all, and tuition free college, you only pop into the media when you feel like blaming someone for your loss, in support of Trump ordering missile strikes, or when you have something to sell.  Don&#39;t allow Clinton and establishment Democrats to revise history, we have records of what really happened.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh a lot of that is cover story and propaganda and political attacks.  Hillary wasn&#39;t popular with a large number of Democratic voters, but that doesn&#39;t mean we voted for Trump the turnip.  </p>

<p>The real reason Hillary lost was successful voter suppression, and oh the single stupidest thing she did was call Trump&#39;s voters, deplorables.  That made it hard for me to vote for her more than anything because to me it was a major bit of evidence conservative third way deplorables were running her campaign.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Republicans didn&#39;t use the MSM...Hillary and the DNC did. They utilized the Pied Piper strategy...CNN only covered Trump as much as they did because Hillary and her goons thought he would be easiest to beat, and so had their friendly journalists in the Corporate Media push Trump as the front-runner, which turned into its own thing (as history has shown). The RNC didn&#39;t purge voter rolls in Brooklyn, they didn&#39;t block people with their Tour bus in Massachusetts, they didn&#39;t have the fucking AP call Cali the day before anyone even voted...that was all the DNC/HRC. Don&#39;t shift the blame, Hillary and her corrupt party are the reasons Trump won and the reasons disaffected voters like me refused to vote for her corrupt ass. </p>

<p>After Sanders was all but mathematically eliminated but still kept attacking her relentlessly, sure.</p>

<p>I&#39;m able to tell my children I didn&#39;t consent to the continued destruction of the Republic under either candidate. If HRC wanted to win, she could have been a better candidate, and a better person, instead of the corrupt Corporatist she is. She tried to guilt everyone into voting for her by being better on Social issues, while neglecting the actual economic issues underlying the whole goddamn mess the Republic is in. A vote for HRC was a vote for corruption. It was an acquiescence to the shitty status quo, and an admittance that nothing will ever get better. Sorry- I&#39;m not signing up for that. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, it wont be difficult. Because the future will be better, when we get actual Social Democrats and Social Democracy in this country. When we return the Party to its New Deal roots. A minor setback is sometimes necessary for the greater good of everyone. As I said, HRC was a consent to the corruption of the system. Bernie offered hope and a new way forward, and the majority of Millennials, and even Democrats in general, are in favor of this.</p>

<p>The Party was strong when it actually fought for workers instead of Corporations. There is nothing but victory in returning to a Party of The People. My vote against HRC was to ensure a better future for my children, especially if they&#39;re Trans, assaulted in school, and believe in Climate Change. Because following HRC&#39;s path will undermine their future even more, since she doesn&#39;t want to solve the underlying economic issues. My kids wont be able to debate trans rights when they&#39;re living in abject poverty and the Middle Class no longer exists. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You don&#39;t have to watch the news to understand that the majority of people did not like Hillary Clinton, at least where I live (suburban southern NY).  Anyone I ever talked to personally were Bernie supporters and Trump supporters, the only people voting for Hillary were women, people voting completely along party lines or Never Trumpers.  She had almost no grassroots movement to speak of and nobody in their right mind would think that she had anywhere near the popularity of Trump or Bernie.</p>

<p>Where do you get the assertion that I believe the news at all?  You shouldn&#39;t just discredit sources offhandedly in the first place, the point is to absorb all media and make your own discernment.</p>

<p>And where is there any proof that this election was stolen in favor of Trump?  It&#39;s <em>far</em> more likely that Hillary Clinton engaged in heavy amounts of voter fraud to pad her vote, and in reality she likely lost by millions to Trump.  This was reflected right in the DNC&#39;s internal documents that were being leaked to 4chan throughout the summer that showed the DNC establishment in panic because they knew they were going to lose without massive fraud to help them... yet somehow that didn&#39;t reflect upon the mainstream media&#39;s outlook on the election, very strange...</p>

<p>The evidence and proof of the DNC and Hillary colluding to defraud Sanders of the nomination is thickly apparent, and it&#39;s clear they were going to try the same tactics again versus Trump until people behind the scenes intervened.  Watch some of Steve Pieczenik&#39;s videos from around the election and you&#39;ll get a <em>much</em> more accurate story of what happened.  The idea that Trump and the Republicans stole their votes and the elections is simply bafflingly ridiculous.</p>

<p>Why I find your comments not believable,  This is the story pushed hard by conservatives.  </p>

<p>I don&#39;t like Hillary very much, I voted Obama, then Sanders, but that doesn&#39;t lead to a vote for Trump or not voting.  </p>

<p>And that is the story I heard post election.  And voter suppression was the real reason Hillary lost and most of the subterfuge was conservative origin, including the Russian propaganda.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just because it&#39;s conservatives calling out Clinton and DNC on corruption in no way makes it untrue.  These are hard facts, the only people denying them are hardline Clinton voters who can&#39;t accept that their candidate lost because she was objectively awful.</p>

<p>She lost because she sucked.  Russia did not force people to vote for Trump, and the Russian collusion narrative has been dead for weeks.</p>

<p>If you want to call bots shills, go ahead. It&#39;s been proven that bots have been used to manipulate voting and posts.</p>

<p>What hasn&#39;t been proven is that an individual account is part of the &quot;Brock brigade&quot; using specific, identifiable &quot;tactics&quot;.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s go back in the conversation:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Will you please point out to me the Brock Brigade, Hillary shills, </p>

<p>Whatever you see that you all believe is bullshit tactics. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now go read the comment he originally responded to, the one talking about shills being &quot;all over Reddit&quot; and making <em>personally directed comments at him</em></p>

<p>Do you think he&#39;s talking about bots being used to make posts and engage in artificial voting, or do you think he was talking about actual astroturfing account who are in comments sections</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you. I was very frustrated seeing what politics turned into after the DNC convention. And was extremely frustrated that the mass amount of observations from various people meant nothing. So I hunted down reddits demographics, and compared that to who they support. So I started getting the argument the D&#39;s are more supportive of the DNC now. So I used data to rpove that claim was BS as well. 18 point drop among left leaning I&#39;s and a 12 point drop among D&#39;s or lean D&#39;s. There is no way to explain this data away. When you compare politics posts now from before the convention. The data telss us it should be even more anti establishment/anti-Democrat than during the primary. One look at politics can tell you that the data is off, or that neoliberals/pro establishment are vastly over represented on reddit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s amazing that you&#39;re missing the obvious right in front of your face. </p>

<p>The demographics that use Reddit skew liberal.</p>

<p>When Bernie was still a candidate, he was the more liberal candidate and was the most liked. </p>

<p>When he was no longer a candidate, liberal people move to the next most liberal person. It also works both ways, look at how many &quot;never Trump&quot;
Republicans actually did vote Trump. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Go to new articles in politics, and pay attention to the tone, especially any articles criticizing her or the DNC. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, it&#39;s a subreddit that leans liberal. It always has. </p>

<p>You&#39;re saying that liberals up voting a liberal candidate and downvoting conservative ones is it of the ordinary. It isn&#39;t. </p>

<p>Bernie still gets more upvotes than Hillary. Which fits perfectly with your numbers. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Also pay attention to all, and notice that nothing critical of her or the DNC, ever makes it there. Because at that point it&#39;s beyond their control to manipulate.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That doesn&#39;t make sense. Either they can control everything or they can&#39;t. </p>

<p>And we&#39;re circling back to the top. Reddit demographics skew liberal. So liberal topics tend to get more upvotes. </p>

<p>For a short the t_d found a way around it using quick stickies that, due to the Reddit algorithm, would put their posts on the front page due to the votes/min count. Also, notice how where you say they don&#39;t have &quot;control&quot; yet the t_d posts that get any traction there reach all and are immediately downvoted back down. </p>

<p>No doubt there are &quot;shills&quot;, but as we&#39;ve seen most of it is about posting links and then using bots to artificially push those stories up. </p>

We will never know because we aren&#39;t reddit engineers, but my point was that your assumption that it was an attempt to suppress T_D in unsupported and at best pure conjecture.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are fairly obvious with your ban baiting here, but I am going to help you out a bit by getting you started on your way to understanding astroturfing in social media.</p>

<p>There is plenty of evidence out there about astroturfing organizations. I have compiled a few links. There are a varied number of political groups, corporate entities and nation states conducting propaganda operations in social media, with the USA having the largest number of registered astroturfing organizations.</p>

<p>There is a lot of info on the astroturfing organizations Correct the Record, ShareBlue and Media Matters. Their official mission statements that are publicly available state their intent to use propaganda for the DNC on the web and on social media such as Reddit, Facebook and Twitter. This implies the use of social community opinion management software and other tools. </p>

<p>From the post:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So we know how popular Sanders and his positions are, yet politics is showing numbers that should not exist considering the raw data we&#39;re looking at. His ideals should still be the super majority it was prior to the DNC convention, yet it&#39;s not, not by a longshot. Single payer is getting shut down as well, an issue that only the staunchest of neoliberals would be against, yet it seems to be the prevailing view in politics. </p>

<p>From this Oxford research paper on astroturfing:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There is no doubt that individual social media users can spread hate speech, troll other users, or set up automated political communication campaigns. Unfortunately, this is also an organized phenomenon, with major governments and political parties dedicating significant resources towards the use of social media for public opinion manipulation.</p>

<p>... In many countries, political actors have no reported ability to field social media campaigns. In some countries, one or two known political actors occasionally use social media for political messaging, and in a few other countries there are multiple government agencies, political parties, or civil society groups organizing trolling and fake news campaigns.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If it ultimately proves un-savable. But current experience shows that it is possible. We are making progress in state parties, having captured the entire party apparatus in Wyoming, Washington, Oregon, Kentucky, Nebraska, Missouri and Colorado. We&#39;ve taken everything but the Chairmanship in Cali (which they cheated to keep) and Massachusetts, and we&#39;re on the verge in Minnesota too. That&#39;s what Our Revolution was founded for- to take it from the ground up. </p>

<p>As I said elsewhere in this thread- the party can do nothing if the base actually engages. Any registered Dem can vote for Precinct Chairs, who vote for County Chairs, who vote for State Chairs, who vote for National Chairs. The inherent weakness of the party, its regionalism, is also the strongest part- because that is how the Citizens can take back control. That is how we steal the actual party bureaucracy from these fools. </p>

<p>I think our best bet for regaining the Republic starts with regaining the Party, which starts at the most local of levels, and trickles <em>upwards</em>. That is what the Grassroots really are. They would love nothing more than for us to marginalize ourselves in a 3rd Party right now, because they know how inherently week their own position is if the People stand up. Have faith friend, we can fucking do this! </p>

<p>Now, let&#39;s dig into the actual link. A read if it makes it clear that if anything this is in favor of Clinton&#39;s connections to Walmart, but asks her to look into how Walmart has helped with the lower income wages and to take good ideas from them.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Whatever the reason for Clinton’s reversal—or for Walton’s—it would certainly be good for the country if presidential candidate Clinton were to learn some things from Walmart. The company and the Walton family have ideas on topics like wages, health care, education, banking, the Second Amendment, and even the environment.</p>

<p>On health care, the $4 generic drugs available at Walmart’s pharmacy are a fine example of how free-market, private-sector capitalist competition, rather than top-down government-imposed price controls, can make medicine affordable for patients.</p>

<p>On education, the Walton Family Foundation says it has supported a quarter of the 6,700 charter schools in the U.S. and it is investing in what it describes as &quot;the high-quality choice movement.&quot; That’s a counterweight to the Clinton campaign’s backers in the teacher unions. Those unions too often see charter schools as threats that siphons money away from schools that employ unionized teachers.</p>

<p>On the Second Amendment, anti-gun activists have publicly called on Walmart to stop selling guns and ammunition in its stores. The store has voluntarily stopped selling some models of rifles, but it continues to sell handguns and other weapons, evidence that businesses are best left to their own judgments on these matters to respond to customer sentiments and demand without congressional interference.</p>

<p>On banking, the extensive financial services that Walmart offers its customers—not only check cashing, but also bill-paying, tax preparation, and a &quot;bluebird&quot; financial account that claims to offer the &quot;benefits of banking without all the fees&quot;—demonstrates how non-bank firms are filling a market gap. Rather than forcing banks with regulations to provide these services or subsidizing the banks with bailouts, why not let the free market work?</p>

<p>On wages, Walmart has been raising pay even without a congressionally mandated increase in the federal minimum wage. And on environmental issues, Walmart has been taking a range of steps—using closed freezers instead of open ones, and putting skylights in stores, using sunshine to save on lighting bills—because they make financial sense, not because they were forced to do so by government rules.</p>

<p><strong><em>So yes, Sen. Sanders is trying to scare his supporters with emails linking Clinton to Walmart. To the non-socialists among us, such a connection is not so much scary as it is at least somewhat reassuring.</em></strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Was that what you thought when the point was raised? Be honest here. I would venture a good guess not! Multiply that by 40x or how many ever points raised. That&#39;s <strong>precisely</strong> the point of Gish Gallop.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Since you apologized, I&#39;ll say you&#39;re participating in good faith!  Cool beans!</p>

<p>Exactly, but you see, it takes OP just minutes to post this. And I bet my bottom dollar this is going to be repeated <em>ad nauseum</em> over the next few months with Clinton&#39;s new book coming out. Hell, the post is titled that way. You&#39;ll find mindless idiots on TD and here repeating it. Gleefully ignoring almost all context just to spread some more talking points all over the place. Thus amplifying OP&#39;s work.</p>

<p>Whereas defending it takes painstaking effort. It took me nearly ten minutes to work this out and convince you. And you&#39;re just ONE person. Rinse and repeat and you see why this works. In fact, this has been an effective tool to spread counter-propaganda, or at least weaken existing facts. Flood information with bullshit. Some crafted, some random, and of course, some truth. Do you know how the news networks ran during the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Not quite unlike how OP is operating. Watch and learn kiddo!</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Ok, go back and read my comments in this thread. If you honestly think that this will be used as a copypasta then debunking it only takes effort one time, and then you have a debunking copypasta.</p>

<p>It takes you how many minutes to analyse a link and do a little write up? Way fewer than 10, because you had to wait for me to respond and then make a reply to my reply, etc. So, if you wanted to, you could create a counter list to all 40 points in about 1 lazy Saturdays worth of work. To me, it&#39;s ironic that you consider this to be so important and potentially damaging but not important enough for your time. That&#39;s why I made fun of the other guy for playing video games.</p>

<p>I think implicit in what you guys a re saying is that all these links are wrong. Isn&#39;t that kind of a reverse gish gallop? If I analyzed one of the link and found that it supported OPs post, then you&#39;d just say, &quot;well, all the others are false&quot; </p>

<p>Also, if you think that all OP needs to do is spam the list to convince people, why wouldn&#39;t you be able to spam your counter-list and get the same immediate convincing? You act like you&#39;d have to personally talk to every person. If OP doesn&#39;t have to, why would you have to?</p>

<p>To sum it up; I don&#39;t understand why people wouldnt want to counter this list. If i cared that much about something and viewed it as potentially damaging as you do, and i had free time to spend playing video games, I&#39;d feel driven to debunk the list.</p>

<p>Here is the CEO of Alphabet contacting Cheryl Mills to offer voter tracking information gathered from your phones (note: this whole email is a WTF moment and the excerpt here is just a portion to support the argument) </p>

<blockquote>
<p>For each voter, a score is computed ranking <strong>probability of the right vote</strong>. Analytics can model demographics, social factors and many other attributes of the needed voters. <strong>Modeling will tell us what who we need to turn out and why</strong>, and studies of effectiveness will let us know what approaches work well. Machine intelligence across the data should identify the most important factors for turnout, and preference.</p>

<p><strong>It should be possible to link the voter records in Van with upcoming databases</strong> from companies like Comcast and others for media measurement purposes.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>the reason this is actually worse than you think is that this is how you can take out opposition precincts with precision. Google knows your home address and how you are going to vote. Combined with NGP Van&#39;s VoteBuilder they also know your voting precinct, who is going to win your precinct and which voters will deliver that victory.</p>

<hr/>

<p>NGP Van&#39;s VoteBuilder had the ability to &quot;update&quot;  voter addresses. Which means VoteBuilder could change your precinct with the voter database, thereby disallowing anyone in a targeted and specific group of people from participating in the primary. </p>

<p>This means that you can change an entire neighborhoods voter affiliation without disrupting the entire election. So that people can still vote in the <em>General</em> without letting opposition participate in the <em>Primary</em>. Take out a dozen blocks of Brooklyn and you can win. This is it. <strong>This is how the primary was rigged against Sanders.</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/20/us/politics/new-york-primary.html">Mayor Bill de Blasio described “the purging of entire buildings and blocks of voters,” while the comptroller, Scott Stringer, said his office would audit the Board of Elections.</a> (NYT - lol, they&#39;ve edited this article about 7 times. It used to be specifically about the voting irregularities) </p>

Just in case you don&#39;t remember: <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2015/12/18/politics/bernie-sanders-campaign-dnc-suspension/index.html">www.cnn.com/2015/12/18/politics/bernie-sanders-campaign-dnc-suspension/index.html</a></p>

<p><a href="http://crooksandliars.com/2015/12/should-dnc-really-trust-their-data-vendor"> Democratic Party sites, paying good money to a company that the DNC recommends, and their security is apparently an after thought.</a> (crooksandliars.com/) </p>

<blockquote>
<p>But what about NGP-VAN? How does the company that the DNC has put so much trust in handle this? 
Out of those three sites, everyone is running insecure versions of Drupal. That is really troubling. These are Democratic Party sites, paying good money to a company that the DNC recommends, and their security is apparently an after thought. (<strong>12/18/15</strong>)</p>
</blockquote>

<hr/>

<p><a href="https://www.databreaches.net/191-million-voters-personal-info-exposed-by-misconfigured-database/">191 million voters’ personal info exposed by misconfigured database</a> (databreaches.net)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>More than one week after Vickery first discovered the leak and we began trying to locate the responsible party, the database remains online and exposed  – despite countless hours on our part trying to track this leak down.</p>

<p>If you are a registered voter, we cannot offer you reassurance that your details have not been obtained and won’t be misused. We don’t know for how long this database has been left unsecured and how many people may have accessed and downloaded it. (<strong>12/28/15</strong>)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, again, should the DNC be putting their trust of their most valuable data in the hands of a company that apparently ignores security? Perhaps they should ask themselves this and take a serious look at their relationship with NGP-VAN.</p>

<hr/>

<p><a href="http://www.npr.org/2016/02/19/467395218/ted-cruz-campaign-takes-voter-micro-targeting-to-next-level">NPR from February, 2016</a> shows micro targeting by Cambridge Analytica from the Ted Cruz campaign. This link shows that micro targeting was an essential part of the 2016 campaign. Allegedly CA had over 4k data points on every single American Voter. That kind of data doesn&#39;t come from door knocking. Rather the data is used to discern which door to knock and which is a waste of time.</p>

<p>This following link shows what Dan Rolle was talking about - the exposed data wasn&#39;t simply voter registration. It was a much more specifically targeted breach. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.csoonline.com/article/3018912/security/18-million-targeted-voter-records-exposed-by-database-error.html">18 million targeted voter records exposed by database error</a> <strong>1/4/16</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>True, voter data is public record for the most part, but each state has laws that govern how it is obtained, how it can be used, and how it can be shared. When you add additional data points, such as those discovered within the second database, you&#39;re no longer talking about pure public record.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>42-year-old Kelly Thornton, who worked as an Election Day Technician in Yavapai County voting center 5 on Tuesday, told US Uncut that roughly two-thirds of voters who came to her precinct had been <a href="https://archive.is/7MFZC"><strong>mistakenly identified as independent by the election software</strong></a>. All of those voters were subsequently forced to cast a provisional ballot. (USUncut)</p>

<hr/>

<p>Again make note of the date of revision at the top of the page on the follow link (June 2016):</p>

<p><a href="http://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/voter-list-accuracy.aspx">http://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/voter-list-accuracy.aspx</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>States can use data from federal agencies, including the United States Post Office, the Social Security Administration and the Department of Homeland Security to verify voter information at the registration stage and to ensure accuracy of the voter list. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>For example,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The United States Post Office (USPS) and National Change of Address (NCOA) files:</p>

<p>Kansas calls for the chief state election official or county officer to check the registration records of voters against the National Change of Address files once each calendar year (K.S.A. §25-2354).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Kansas is only an example, this is done all over. </p>

<hr/>

<p>So we see that NGP Van can change your voting precinct; It&#39;s possible voter affiliations were altered in targeted attacks by using micro-targeting and exposed databases. Google has told the Clinton campaign who people will vote for using micro targeting. Specific neighborhoods had targeted affiliation changes that disallowed voters to participate in the primary but wouldnt change their ability to vote in the general. This meant that individual precincts could be flipped by disallowing a handful of people within that precinct from participating. Poll workers in multiple states are on record stating that vast numbers of people showed up to a primary that they shouldnt have, as if 2/3 of people in Phoenix dont know what party they registered for. Sounds a lot Arizona and Brooklyn. Creating long lines and general disarray would make voting significantly more difficult for low-income and young voters. The DNC didnt need to take away every single Sanders vote. Just create chaos in Sanders precincts to discourage his turnout. By changing affiliations and polling locations, it creates a customer service type of nightmare at the front of the lines and discourages participation from those that cannot wait in line for 4 hours to cast a ballot in a primary. </p>

<p>This is actual rigging of an election. This does not require thousands of people to be involved. It could be accomplished with as few as one person once obtaining all the data and with 6 weeks before the primaries began, there was plenty of time to identify &quot;the right vote&quot; and to ensure opposition wasn&#39;t there.</p>

<p>Here is a list of the shenanigans, state by state: <a href="http://www.heavy.com/news/2016/11/election-fraud-list-which-states-had-have-voter-fraud-allegations-early-voting-rigged-hoax-truth-trump-clinton-bernie-flipped-suppression-dnc/">www.heavy.com/news/2016/11/election-fraud-list-which-states-had-have-voter-fraud-allegations-early-voting-rigged-hoax-truth-trump-clinton-bernie-flipped-suppression-dnc/</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>The DNC has been selling out there base for a long time.  Remember when they took single payer off the table because it was to controversial and would divide their base?  These were talking the talking points from a strategy outlined in <a href="https://thinkprogress.org/leaked-memos-reveal-ahip-is-recycling-playbook-against-michael-moore-to-derail-health-reform-f5d0b35e9cff/">2 leaked memos from AHIP</a>.  AHIP is &quot;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/America&#x27;s_Health_Insurance_Plans">America’s Health Insurance Plans is a national political advocacy and trade association with about 1,300 member companies that sell health insurance coverage</a>&quot;.
  This was almost a decade ago, yet Democrats haven&#39;t changed, here is an article with audio of <a href="https://theintercept.com/2017/07/01/dick-gephardt-single-payer-health-insurance-lobbyists/">Dick Gephardt, the former Democratic House minority leader, laughing off the idea at a health insurance conference earlier this month</a>.  It&#39;s why the<a href="http://thehill.com/business-a-lobbying/318577-architects-of-obamacare-reap-windfall-as-washington-lobbyists"> ACA was written by insurance lobbies</a>, and Democrats will defend it while it makes us all go broke.  Dennis Kucinich actual was the one vote that shot down the ACA the first time it they tried to pass it, and <a href="https://www.commondreams.org/views/2009/11/08/hr-3962-why-i-voted-no">he wrote, the bill is a bailout under a blue cross</a>.  Although he did eventually vote for it, after <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/03/15/obama-brings-dennis-kucin_n_499313.html">Obama took him on a personal trip on Air Force One</a> and &quot;some how convinced him&quot; to vote for it.  Re-read Dennis&#39;s article he wrote, then think what they must have said to have him change his mind, always found that interesting.</p>

<p>Anyways, the DNC &amp; Democrats sell out their base all the time, and anyone who feels the need to defend them should really think about how they are being manipulated and undermined by this group.  </p>

<p>Dislcaimer: By point this out, I am not saying the RNC and Republicans are any better.  They are horrible and a scourge, but the DNC &amp; Democrats have people believing they are there for the people, when they wouldn&#39;t piss on you if you were on fire.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Albert Einstein in his essay <a href="https://monthlyreview.org/2009/05/01/why-socialism/">Why Socialism?</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Private capital tends to become concentrated in few hands, partly because of competition among the capitalists, and partly because technological development and the increasing division of labor encourage the formation of larger units of production at the expense of smaller ones. <em>The result of these developments is an oligarchy of private capital the enormous power of which cannot be effectively checked even by a democratically organized political society.</em> <strong><em>This is true since the members of legislative bodies are selected by political parties, largely financed or otherwise influenced by private capitalists who, for all practical purposes, separate the electorate from the legislature. The consequence is that the representatives of the people do not in fact sufficiently protect the interests of the underprivileged sections of the population.</em></strong> Moreover, under existing conditions, private capitalists inevitably control, directly or indirectly, the main sources of information (press, radio, education). It is thus extremely difficult, and indeed in most cases quite impossible, for the individual citizen to come to objective conclusions and to make intelligent use of his political rights.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is true of both political parties in America. When Ron Paul and the average poster here talks about Wall Street/central banks, they&#39;re talking about finance capitalists. When they talk about media conglomeration, they&#39;re talking about capitalist owners controlling what we see and learn. That money and propaganda influence politics should surprise literally no one, least of all here. Surprise, those with the most money have the most influence on our political system. </p>

She and her supporters, are incapable of taking personal accountability for anything, all they can do is shame and belittle the folks that are opposed to this. It cost them the election, yet they&#39;re still using the same tactics to this day. It almost makes me think this is a deliberate move. How else could you explain the irrationality here? They talk about unity, and actively engage in division. There will be no unity until you own up to the mistakes committed. There will be no moving forward, and all the folks who got screwed over, will never forget this.</p>

<p>CEO of Alphabet contacts Cheryl Mills to offer voter tracking information gathered from your phones</p>

<p><a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/37262">https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/37262</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>For each voter, a score is computed ranking <strong>probability of the right vote</strong>. Analytics can model demographics, social factors and many other attributes of the needed voters. <strong>Modeling will tell us what who we need to turn out and why</strong>, and studies of effectiveness will let us know what approaches work well. Machine intelligence across the data should identify the most important factors for turnout, and preference.</p>

<p><strong>It should be possible to link the voter records in Van with upcoming databases</strong> from companies like Comcast and others for media measurement purposes.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>the reason this is actually worse than you think is that this is how you can take out opposition precincts with precision. Google knows your home address and how you are going to vote. Combined with NGP Van&#39;s VoteBuilder they also know your voting precinct, who is going to win your precinct and which voters will deliver that victory.</p>

<p>NGP Van had the ability to &quot;update&quot;  voter addresses so &quot;inactive&quot;  voters would be pulled from the rolls. It was also the vendor used by NY state (possibly many more) to index voter data for the registrar. Which means VoteBuilder could <del><em>change your affiliation</em> from, I don&#39;t know, say from Democrat to NPP or Republican or just</del> (6/2/2017) change your precinct and had access to change your address. </p>

<p>This means that you can change an entire neighborhoods voter affiliation without disrupting the entire election. So that people can still vote in the <em>General</em> without letting opposition participate in the <em>Primary</em>. Take out a dozen blocks of Brooklyn and you can win. This is it. <strong>This is how the primary was rigged against Sanders.</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/20/us/politics/new-york-primary.html">Mayor Bill de Blasio described “the purging of entire buildings and blocks of voters,” while the comptroller, Scott Stringer, said his office would audit the Board of Elections.</a> (NYT)</p>

<p>42-year-old Kelly Thornton, who worked as an Election Day Technician in Yavapai County voting center 5 on Tuesday, told US Uncut that roughly two-thirds of voters who came to her precinct had been <a href="http://usuncut.com/politics/5-examples-voter-suppression-arizona-primary/"><strong>mistakenly identified as independent by the election software</strong></a>. All of those voters were subsequently forced to cast a provisional ballot. (USUncut)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But what about NGP-VAN? How does the company that the DNC has put so much trust in handle this? 
Out of those three sites, everyone is running insecure versions of Drupal. That is really troubling. These are Democratic Party sites, paying good money to a company that the DNC recommends, and their security is apparently an after thought. (<strong>12/18/15</strong>)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>More than one week after Vickery first discovered the leak and we began trying to locate the responsible party, the database remains online and exposed  – despite countless hours on our part trying to track this leak down.</p>

<p>If you are a registered voter, we cannot offer you reassurance that your details have not been obtained and won’t be misused. We don’t know for how long this database has been left unsecured and how many people may have accessed and downloaded it. (<strong>12/28/15</strong>)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So both the National registry and DNC voter data was available to editing simultaneously and it wasn&#39;t the fault of the Republican program &quot;NationBuilder&quot;. </p>

<p>So, again, should the DNC be putting their trust of their most valuable data in the hands of a company that apparently ignores security? Perhaps they should ask themselves this and take a serious look at their relationship with NGP-VAN.</p>

<hr/>

<p><a href="http://www.npr.org/2016/02/19/467395218/ted-cruz-campaign-takes-voter-micro-targeting-to-next-level">NPR from February</a> shows micro targeting from the Ted Cruz campaign.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.csoonline.com/article/3018912/security/18-million-targeted-voter-records-exposed-by-database-error.html">18 million targeted voter records exposed by database error</a> <strong>1/4/16</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>True, voter data is public record for the most part, but each state has laws that govern how it is obtained, how it can be used, and how it can be shared. When you add additional data points, such as those discovered within the second database, you&#39;re no longer talking about pure public record.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr/>

<p>So we see that NGP Van can change your voting precinct and possibly voter affiliation. Google has told the Clinton campaign who people will vote for using micro targeting. Specific neighborhoods had targeted affiliation changes that disallowed voters to participate in the primary but wouldnt change their ability to vote in the general. This meant that individual precincts could be flipped by disallowing a handful of people within that precinct from participating. Poll workers in multiple states are on record stating that vast numbers of people showed up to a primary that they shouldnt have, as if 2/3 of people in Phoenix dont know what party they registered for. </p>

<p>Edit 6/2/17: I will walk back the claim that VB could edit party affiliation itself, though the means to do so were available to any party interested in doing so. However VB <em>could</em> change your polling location through the National Change of Address Registry. Not unlike Arizona and Brooklyn. Creating long lines and general disarray would make voting significantly more difficult for low-income and young voters. The DNC didnt need to take away every single Sanders vote. Just create chaos in Sanders precincts to discourage his turnout. By changing affiliations and polling locations, it creates a customer service type of nightmare at the front of the lines and discourages participation from those that cannot wait in line for 4 hours to cast a ballot in a primary.</p>

We also have a nation of 320M+ that aren&#39;t in the best shape health wise whether it be obesity or any other numbers of issues.

<p>They were good enough to keep a thousand plates spinning at once, adding hundreds of millions of loot to their coffers.  But she was never good enough to do both, and has failed twice now.  We saw every trick she had 15 years ago, there&#39;s no move she can make that can&#39;t be countered.  Obama and Trump both had better game than she has.</p>

<p>All this Clinton activity in the past few months make me think she&#39;s going to force her party to nominate her again in 2020.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s always funny when it reaches that point. Suddenly people who never post in r/conspiracy start arguing with the people who do, from a position of smug superiority, regurgitating the Corporate Media Propaganda they&#39;ve bought into hook, line, and sinker. Also they just start ridiculing people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah force people that have spent hundreds of thousands on their education to take a pay cut. That will certainly have a beneficial impact on quality of service when there are fewer and fewer doctors and nurses willing to work for government mandated wages. We also have a nation of 320M+ that aren&#39;t in the best shape health wise whether it be obesity or any other numbers of issues. Will also severely impact future medical advancements as people will be less willing to invest billions looking for cures for diseases if they can&#39;t get a return on the investment. And no, &quot;good feelz&quot; is not a sufficient return on investment. </p>
