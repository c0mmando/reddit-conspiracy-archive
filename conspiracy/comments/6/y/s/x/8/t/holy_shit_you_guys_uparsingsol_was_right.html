       lol, you're right. He's definitely made a few other bold predictions that never came to be. But still, his last post was unlike many of his others. He wrote with absolute conviction, he was sure the massive solar flare or whatever was going to lead to a massive Earthquake. I'm not going to argue your premise though, you make enough predictions, you're going to get it right sooner or later. I made a point to keep my eyes on that sight for the next week though after I read his last post simply because of how convinced he was. It's a little cool, ya gotta admit.

       He's been just as sure in his last predictions though. He said an earthquake would hit Nepal within 48 hours, and then it got stretched to 72. He was "sure of it" then too and a number of other times. It isn't really cool to me that someone makes prediction after prediction and ends up getting something right for once. If he had made a single post and it happened then yeah, that'd be cool.

       Lol no, I don't have to "give him credit". What would I give him credit for? He's been wrong every time and now just happens to be "right". This is like me saying "it'll snow this winter, you'll see guys!!1!" in Canada and then acting like I was right when it finally ends up happening.

       He did just change his model. The soul of an entrepreneur is built upon 1000 failures (unless you have a rich dad), and thus the circumjacent nature of theoretical science.

       Then he should be able to run the past data through his "new model" and compare the results to what actually happened. It's really simple to prove if it's a viable model.

       Yeah, the next step of the scientific model isn't gloating or taking a victory lap. It's reproduction of results.
      </p>
      <p>
       If he actually predicted this one, I'd say his next predictions are really going to matter. Because now he's not just some loon wildly making predictions, he's going to be trying to prove he can actually do this and the one wasn't just a fluke.

       That's a terrible analogy, but anyway, this isn't the first time he's been right lol. Not even close. If he were always wrong nobody would ever fucking give his posts a second glance, get real. Months ago there was a post that had compiled all his predictions and the outcomes. He's been right unequivocally more than any one of us making random shots or predictions could have been. That being said, he's also far from perfect. But when you take into consideration the fact that he's using an extremely unorthodox means to make these predictions, using data and statistics that damn near anyone would have never, ever thought had any relation or effect on each other, abd he's yielding (somewhat) accurate results from his theories. Again, far from perfect, but this situation is a perfect representation of the early stages of the scientific method and how we come up with new and better ways to understand our world. If he had it all 100% figured out he wouldn't be asking for funding and shit. This is the process of progress. If we always completely dismissed any new ideas, methods, practices, or whatever, simply because it wasn't 100% accurate all the time, well then we'd fucking never get anywhere, would we?!? Do you see what I'm saying?!? He's not just taking shots in the dark based on nothing of merit. He has very methodically and meticulously collected massive amounts of data and information, and with that hypotheses that there's a possible relation between the two. It obviously needs more work to become finely tuned, but either way it's fairly impressive that he's manage to find such an obscure relationship between two sets of data to BETTER predict the world we live in. 
You're absolutely entitled to your opinion, but if you sincerely equate his work and his posts to a prediction of 'snow in the winter in Canada', than you're clearly embarrassingly misinformed on the whole situation. If that is the case, I encourage you to go read his post history, and other users posts about him. He's generated a little bit of a following, and that doesn't just happen for no ducking reason.

       People are ignoring the fact that we literally just got hit by a huge CMe, he made the prediction knowing we would get hit by a CME, and we already have see correlation between getting hit by a large CME and subsequent earthquake activity.

       Over the years I have lived in my current area, the weather office has produced dozens of tornado watches. But in all those years we have had two EF0's and neither occurred during a tornado watch.
      </p>
      <p>
       So far these highly skilled meteorologists have a worse average than

       . Despite the abysmal rate of failure from the weather office, do I ignore the warnings? Nope.

       Because tornado watch doesn't mean there is going to be a tornado, it means conditions are right for a tornado so be ready. A tornado warning means one is either forming or is already destroying a trailer park.

      <p>
       I get your point though and have gone from being very critical of parsingsol back to just being very skeptical. His accuracy numbers are still amazingly low, and I have yet to see any of his calculations or models explained in more detail than "solar flare = earthquake".

       It's tough to tell what's just a prediction and what's a guarantee when every one of his posts says "This is it, guaranteed biggest quake of the year!!!!" It gets old when the weather people do the same thing for every storm that comes through.

       I will lead by saying I do not know much about earthquakes and solar flares, much less their relationship together.  So I'm basing my opinions off of what others say.  I'm willing to let parsingsol keep doing what he's doing and I'll watch and observe.
      </p>
      <p>
       With that said, it seems like people already have charted solar activity and earthquakes and found no correlation...at least statistically.  When charted out you can see solar flares increase and decrease in number, but earthquake numbers seem to remain the same no matter what solar flares are doing.
       <a href="http://www.thesuntoday.org/solar-facts/flares-and-earthquakes/">
        As seen here.
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Judging by how often parsingsol has been on here claiming here comes one and nothing happens, it really just feels like he is guessing.  However, I don't think he should stop what he's doing.  There isn't any reason for him to stop for one, but if he ends up correct and he can get a model out there that predicts earthquakes it will be the first time we could predict them as no such model currently exists.

       He also has been right with some of them. It's all about trial and error when you're working with a theory. Hopefully this open up a door with figuring out if solar activity affects earth quakes.

       The thing is his model should be easy to test right now. There is enough data from previous earthquakes and solar events to run against his model to see if it works. He doesn't need to do this "trial and error" everytime a new event happens.
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem seems to be that he either is unwilling or unable to do this. And as far as I can tell has never been able to explain his model in a way that allows people to test it out themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you had to ask me I'd say he just loves the attention of making a prediction everytime. Or perhaps he is just trying to get donations and doesn't really care about getting the science right.

       Look - I'm not saying I understand his work. And I know he's been wrong. This time was the first I'd seen where he was 100%. I can understand that it's an evolving theory - potentially. Maybe it's just fucking guessing - I don't know. I'd need more data and more information. I am not an earthquake scientist.
      </p>
      <p>
       Possibly his theory or his work - whatever you want to call it - doesn't account for "where". And maybe it will evolve to include it better.
      </p>
      <p>
       If we could potentially have better understanding of earthquakes worldwide - is that not a good thing? He's spending HIS time to do this. Nothing more. He's making a few posts here and there. You can choose to ignore. That's easy to do. His research is not harming anyone. If it improves our understanding of earthquakes and how they happen - to me that's a good thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do not know enough now, to know whether or not he knows what he's doing. Time will tell.

       he was not 100% right, mexico is a big country, and he predic mexico city, with is quite far from the epicenter... i concede that there could be a relation between the solar flares that he and earthquake, but his mistakes just prove that what you call research is just guessing.

       He is working on the science actively and is openly calling for assistance to determine if the model is true or not, and he has at least proposed a testible hypothesis and needs help doing the data science. I'd say he's doing things right. He is, as far as I am aware, open about correcting the model given past data, and is not "religious" or "closed-minded" about the subject act all. All these people shitting on him could use the opportunity to assist in the model to show what's wrong, but really whats going on is just a brigade bandwagon effect distorting the reception of him to

       An earthquake of this magnitude only happens about once a year. As he gave a week prediction window, the odds of him nailing this were 1/52.

       Him getting this prediction correct is much more significant than his misses of lesser magnitude quakes.

       it technically couldnt though, guy listed 7 of the most common cities to have earthquakes based on tectonic plates and volcanic activity. 1000km is a large distance when making a guess, even more so when saying they nailed it.

       I mean yeah a broken clock is right twice a day. But still that’s pretty damn impressive to predict one, near where it would occur and what the magnitude would be. A magnitude 8 quake isn’t that common at all.

       I agree it isnt common, but I just disagree I guess. He was bound to get something right, but I dont agree that 1000km away is accurate, thats just my thoughts though. I just dont think it has anything to do with his "model" and is fully based on luck at this point with all the previous wrong predictions.

       You keep going back to the location.  He chose not to actually predict location.  A few people pushed him to make that prediction and he threw out some guesses.  To support a major quake such as that you would think it would be centered around the locations that could support such a sizeable quake.

       He has locations in all of his predictions. And yes, which is why it isn't really a prediction it's a guess. If his model is accurate, and this prediction was right I'll expect the coming correct predictions as well.

       ho none taken, the only thing that really kinda boils my blood here is the stupid amount of energy wasted by people that have a sincere will to learn, just zero ability to understand how. Some of these guys totally could get a degree or a job if they turned on the rationnality button in their heads. also shit science angers me a bit. and the discredit thrown on actual conspiracies (irancontra, watergate etc) by the people who think "soros totally drinks blood like all ((joos))" is a conspiracy; because the work done by people like Jim Hougan really deserves respect, unlike the drivel thatgets posted here day in day out.

       I participated in his thread from
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6vbk20/the_worst_of_earthquakes_for_the_week_should_cone/">
        two and a half weeks ago
       </a>
       and followed (to the best of my ability) what his reasoning was as to when the earthquake would happen. It didn't happen.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not saying that solar wind has no significant effect on seismic activity, he may be entirely correct about it, but the model being used is hugely inconsistent with &gt;7 magnitude earthquakes being predicted and nothing actually occurring

       I've never gotten a "shill vibe" from him. Imo he's as genuine as they come. Such a sad world we live in where caring is mocked. This entire thread is like high school.

       - ignore the hate spewing from this thread. You nailed it brother, even mentioning Mexico. Think about what you just did, predicted a very rare occurrence (8+ yearly?) in a country that hasn't had an earthquake as large as that in over a century. Cheers on you man! I hope this is what finally turns the tide in funding for your research.

       Big quakes produce aurora like light in the sky above the quake..before and after.  its due to the piezoelectric effect...hammer a million tons of rock just right and it generates electricity, just like your piezo propane starter. But the piezo effect works both ways.  hit a rock, or your propane lighter, with a million volts and it flexes.  Spaceweather dot com has the most recent info on cmes.

       is actually paying attention, it's insane watching this shit get upvoted. He was "right" with an incredibly vague prediction where he listed half a dozen locations the closest of which was still 1000km+ away and everybody is going apeshit like his magical brain knows everything.

       Maybe he'll be right again. Probably not, looking at his batting average. I'm expecting weeks of more bullshit with nothing to show for it being upvoted like he's the fucking messiah though.

       He makes predictions using data analysis not tarot cards.

       This could absolutely be a result of him refining his analysis process (ie, getting better at reading the data and seeing the patterns).

       The level of hate towards him is really awkward.
      </p>
      <p>
       He said over 8.0 which is a rather ridiculous claim, and over 8.0 hit.
      </p>
      <p>
       He clearly has a model that ties into the solar flares and while location might be hard to predict, the fact he did call for this with a high level of certainty should be looked into more.
      </p>
      <p>
       If I missed a ton of other "8.0+ earthquake calls" he's had, please list them?
      </p>
      <p>
       He had a miss the week before that happened during eclipse, but that set that comes from eclipses is like maybe twice a lifetime avg...

       His other model should be taken a lot more seriously

       We just want evidence to support your skepticism. I'm skeptic myself and will continue to look into it; but I will not belittle people simply because I don't agree. There's debates and there's arguments. The latter is a language of idiots.
If you feel the need to add your two cents so bad, at least provide something to back you up, and NEVER down people for their intellect or because you don't agree. That, my good sir, will make you look more of an idiot than they could ever be.

       Double standard I guess. You're right, partly. You need proof to believe and proof to not believe, if you choose to spread the information. You can also believe those things without proof, but it's not right to push those beliefs on someone without evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       And you're right, he's made a lot of failed predictions. I don't think this is something to believe or not to believe but to study. What I get out of it, is it's a theory. Like the string theory, it's theoretically possible but there's not a whole lot of evidence to support it. I see this the same way, it's a theory that needs further testing to prove.
      </p>
      <p>
       With all that being said, what's the point of belittling people because you don't agree? What's the point of commenting on everyone's beliefs? You haven't looked at the numbers, studied the charts, verified no problems in the algorithms. No, you say because he predicted a lot wrong then there's no way he can be onto something, which there is not evidence to prove that just as there's not enough to prove he's onto something.

       Fair enough. Again, I think more study should be done. I personally haven't seen anything to prove it wrong except that his other predictions are not correct. There's so many variables and so many other things could come into play. 
Regardless, with this prediction, I personally believe it could be a stepping stone, even if it's just a small limp. He obviously had reason to predict this and work on this so he has to have some sort of lead.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like I said before, I'm still skeptical and I don't disagree with you. I just think some of your words would be more justifiable with other evidence. Same as mine, which is why I'm trying not to discuss the theory itself as I need to know more about it to form an opinion.

       All in all I just think you should do more studying before you shove your beliefs down other throats. In the past year, I've almost completely changed my life because I learned more and developed new opinions on the topic. From religion to politics to science to psychology and more. I will probably continue to alter my opinions as I learn more. 
I feel like you are set on what you believe and anything that comes up to contradict it, you immediately shut it down and try to use demeaning phrases in order to send people to your beliefs.

       You know, I hate predictions, prophecies and premonitions that only seem to be supported by visions/dreams/hunchs/pseudo-science/poorly supported science (as mostly are made to produce fear), but I remembered his post the same moment I saw the news and even within the 7 days range.

       Its amusing watching the hate towards people trying to predict the future to the best of their abilities. I think the most significant factor of the whole thing is that at this point over the last few years watching the data, the sun almost definitely has a large influence on earthquakes on this planet.
