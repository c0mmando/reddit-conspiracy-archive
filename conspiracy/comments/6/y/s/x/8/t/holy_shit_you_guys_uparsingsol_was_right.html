    <div class="md"><p>lol, you&#39;re right. He&#39;s definitely made a few other bold predictions that never came to be. But still, his last post was unlike many of his others. He wrote with absolute conviction, he was sure the massive solar flare or whatever was going to lead to a massive Earthquake. I&#39;m not going to argue your premise though, you make enough predictions, you&#39;re going to get it right sooner or later. I made a point to keep my eyes on that sight for the next week though after I read his last post simply because of how convinced he was. It&#39;s a little cool, ya gotta admit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He&#39;s been just as sure in his last predictions though. He said an earthquake would hit Nepal within 48 hours, and then it got stretched to 72. He was &quot;sure of it&quot; then too and a number of other times. It isn&#39;t really cool to me that someone makes prediction after prediction and ends up getting something right for once.

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s a terrible analogy, but anyway, this isn&#39;t the first time he&#39;s been right lol. Not even close. If he were always wrong nobody would ever fucking give his posts a second glance, get real. Months ago there was a post that had compiled all his predictions and the outcomes. He&#39;s been right unequivocally more than any one of us making random shots or predictions could have been. That being said, he&#39;s also far from perfect. But when you take into consideration the fact that he&#39;s using an extremely unorthodox means to make these predictions, using data and statistics that damn near anyone would have never, ever thought had any relation or effect on each other, abd he&#39;s yielding (somewhat) accurate results from his theories. Again, far from perfect, but this situation is a perfect representation of the early stages of the scientific method and how we come up with new and better ways to understand our world. If he had it all 100% figured out he wouldn&#39;t be asking for funding and shit. This is the process of progress. If we always completely dismissed any new ideas, methods, practices, or whatever, simply because it wasn&#39;t 100% accurate all the time, well then we&#39;d fucking never get anywhere, would we?!? Do you see what I&#39;m saying?!? He&#39;s not just taking shots in the dark based on nothing of merit. He has very methodically and meticulously collected massive amounts of data and information, and with that hypotheses that there&#39;s a possible relation between the two. It obviously needs more work to become finely tuned, but either way it&#39;s fairly impressive that he&#39;s manage to find such an obscure relationship between two sets of data to BETTER predict the world we live in. 
You&#39;re absolutely entitled to your opinion, but if you sincerely equate his work and his posts to a prediction of &#39;snow in the winter in Canada&#39;, than you&#39;re clearly embarrassingly misinformed on the whole situation. If that is the case, I encourage you to go read his post history, and other users posts about him. He&#39;s generated a little bit of a following, and that doesn&#39;t just happen for no ducking reason.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I will lead by saying I do not know much about earthquakes and solar flares, much less their relationship together.  So I&#39;m basing my opinions off of what others say.  I&#39;m willing to let parsingsol keep doing what he&#39;s doing and I&#39;ll watch and observe.</p>

<p>With that said, it seems like people already have charted solar activity and earthquakes and found no correlation...at least statistically.  When charted out you can see solar flares increase and decrease in number, but earthquake numbers seem to remain the same no matter what solar flares are doing.  <a href="http://www.thesuntoday.org/solar-facts/flares-and-earthquakes/">As seen here.</a></p>

<p>Judging by how often parsingsol has been on here claiming here comes one and nothing happens, it really just feels like he is guessing.  However, I don&#39;t think he should stop what he&#39;s doing.  There isn&#39;t any reason for him to stop for one, but if he ends up correct and he can get a model out there that predicts earthquakes it will be the first time we could predict them as no such model currently exists.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The thing is his model should be easy to test right now. There is enough data from previous earthquakes and solar events to run against his model to see if it works. He doesn&#39;t need to do this &quot;trial and error&quot; everytime a new event happens. </p>

<p>The problem seems to be that he either is unwilling or unable to do this. And as far as I can tell has never been able to explain his model in a way that allows people to test it out themselves. </p>

<p>If you had to ask me I&#39;d say he just loves the attention of making a prediction everytime. Or perhaps he is just trying to get donations and doesn&#39;t really care about getting the science right.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Look - I&#39;m not saying I understand his work. And I know he&#39;s been wrong. This time was the first I&#39;d seen where he was 100%. I can understand that it&#39;s an evolving theory - potentially. Maybe it&#39;s just fucking guessing - I don&#39;t know. I&#39;d need more data and more information. I am not an earthquake scientist. </p>

<p>Possibly his theory or his work - whatever you want to call it - doesn&#39;t account for &quot;where&quot;. And maybe it will evolve to include it better. </p>

<p>If we could potentially have better understanding of earthquakes worldwide - is that not a good thing? He&#39;s spending HIS time to do this. Nothing more. He&#39;s making a few posts here and there. You can choose to ignore. That&#39;s easy to do. His research is not harming anyone. If it improves our understanding of earthquakes and how they happen - to me that&#39;s a good thing. </p>

<p>I do not know enough now, to know whether or not he knows what he&#39;s doing. Time will tell. </p>

I hope this is what finally turns the tide in funding for your research.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Big quakes produce aurora like light in the sky above the quake..before and after.  its due to the piezoelectric effect...hammer a million tons of rock just right and it generates electricity, just like your piezo propane starter. But the piezo effect works both ways.  hit a rock, or your propane lighter, with a million volts and it flexes.  Spaceweather dot com has the most recent info on cmes.</p>

<p>He said over 8.0 which is a rather ridiculous claim, and over 8.0 hit.</p>

<p>He clearly has a model that ties into the solar flares and while location might be hard to predict, the fact he did call for this with a high level of certainty should be looked into more.</p>

<p>If I missed a ton of other &quot;8.0+ earthquake calls&quot; he&#39;s had, please list them?</p>

<p>He had a miss the week before that happened during eclipse, but that set that comes from eclipses is like maybe twice a lifetime avg...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Double standard I guess. You&#39;re right, partly. You need proof to believe and proof to not believe, if you choose to spread the information. You can also believe those things without proof, but it&#39;s not right to push those beliefs on someone without evidence. </p>

<p>And you&#39;re right, he&#39;s made a lot of failed predictions. I don&#39;t think this is something to believe or not to believe but to study. What I get out of it, is it&#39;s a theory. Like the string theory, it&#39;s theoretically possible but there&#39;s not a whole lot of evidence to support it. I see this the same way, it&#39;s a theory that needs further testing to prove. </p>

<p>With all that being said, what&#39;s the point of belittling people because you don&#39;t agree? What&#39;s the point of commenting on everyone&#39;s beliefs? You haven&#39;t looked at the numbers, studied the charts, verified no problems in the algorithms. No, you say because he predicted a lot wrong then there&#39;s no way he can be onto something, which there is not evidence to prove that just as there&#39;s not enough to prove he&#39;s onto something. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fair enough. Again, I think more study should be done. I personally haven&#39;t seen anything to prove it wrong except that his other predictions are not correct. There&#39;s so many variables and so many other things could come into play. 
Regardless, with this prediction, I personally believe it could be a stepping stone, even if it&#39;s just a small limp. He obviously had reason to predict this and work on this so he has to have some sort of lead. </p>

<p>Like I said before, I&#39;m still skeptical and I don&#39;t disagree with you. I just think some of your words would be more justifiable with other evidence. Same as mine, which is why I&#39;m trying not to discuss the theory itself as I need to know more about it to form an opinion. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>All in all I just think you should do more studying before you shove your beliefs down other throats. In the past year, I&#39;ve almost completely changed my life because I learned more and developed new opinions on the topic. From religion to politics to science to psychology and more. I will probably continue to alter my opinions as I learn more. 
I feel like you are set on what you believe and anything that comes up to contradict it, you immediately shut it down and try to use demeaning phrases in order to send people to your beliefs.</p>
