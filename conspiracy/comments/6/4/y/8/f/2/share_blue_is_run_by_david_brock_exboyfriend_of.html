    <div class="md"><p>Nice Try Sharia Blue! But you guys always fail. </p>

<p>Trump didn&#39;t take a private jet to Jeffrey Epsteins private island 28 times like Bill Clinton did. </p>

<p>And Trump kicked Epstein out of Mar a Lago in 1999 when he found out he was hitting on young girls. Epstein is banned from there. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maRT3TEcRLs">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maRT3TEcRLs</a></p>

<p>Epstein was a co-founder of the Clinton Foundation</p>

    <div class="md"><p>1999 you say? </p>

<p>Weird cus he was still praising him in 2005.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“I’ve known Jeff for fifteen years. Terrific guy,” Trump told New York Magazine for a 2002 profile of Epstein. “He’s a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side. No doubt about it — Jeffrey enjoys his social life.”</p>

<p>Similarly, a 2003 Vanity Fair profile of Epstein named Trump as one of the “businessmen who dine with him at his home,” and several other articles have pegged Trump and Epstein as friends.</p>

<p>And when FBI investigators looked through Epstein’s private address book, they found 14 different phone numbers for Trump, including numbers for his security guard and houseman. Epstein also had numbers for Trump’s daughter Ivanka and his ex-wife Ivana</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Name me one financial connection that Jeffrey Epstein and Donald Trump share. </p>

<p>Besides Jeffrey&#39;s claim, is there any verifiable proof, or photographic evidence of Trump and Epstein dined together? </p>

<p>I have more proof that Bill Clinton and Trump were friends, than I do for Epstein. </p>

<p>Same for Prince Andrew and Epstein</p>

<p>Can&#39;t find jack shit when it comes to Trump and Epstein hanging out together. 
I went back and did isolated searched from 1995 - 2016 and not a one. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>And 21 different numbers for Bill Clinton. A number for Chealsea Clinton and Hillary. </p>

<p>Also ALL of Trump&#39;s kids names are in that book too. Along with an assortment of Phone Numbers for other famous people. </p>

<p>But I didn&#39;t see Trump&#39;s name on the Private Lolita Island Visitor Logs.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_defamation_law">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_defamation_law</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>the [Supreme Court] issued an opinion in New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, 376 U.S. 254 (1964) dramatically changing the nature of libel law in the United States. In that case, the court determined that public officials could win a suit for libel only if they could demonstrate &quot;actual malice&quot; on the part of reporters or publishers. In that case, &quot;actual malice&quot; was defined as &quot;knowledge that the information was false&quot; or that it was published &quot;with reckless disregard of whether it was false or not&quot;. This decision was later extended to cover &quot;public figures&quot;, although the standard is still considerably lower in the case of private individuals.</p>

<p>Statements are defamatory per se where they <strong>falsely</strong> impute to the plaintiff one or more of the following things:[2]
Allegations or imputations &quot;injurious to another in their trade, business, or profession&quot;
Allegations or imputations &quot;of loathsome disease&quot; (historically leprosy and sexually transmitted disease, now also including mental illness)
Allegations or imputations of &quot;unchastity&quot; (usually only in unmarried people and sometimes only in women)
Allegations or imputations of criminal activity (sometimes only crimes of moral turpitude)[12][13]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If a statement is true, it is not libel. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I dont think you know what &quot;prove a negative&quot; means. You can absolutely prove that there is an absence of evidence for something. In the case of a libel suite, you could win if your accuser fails to provide any evidence of their accusation and (in the US) you can provide evidence that they made the claim with malice aforethought. </p>

<p>They are both well connected billionaires. In fact, they are both well connected <em>to each other</em>. They are on equal footing here, and surely if child exploitation and pedophilia are at issue, this is no excuse for inaction.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We don&#39;t know what Trump personally knew about Epstein&#39;s activities at that time. Saying someone likes younger women doesn&#39;t automatically mean pedophilia and it doesn&#39;t automatically imply something illegal either, given that the age of consent is not the same from state to state or country to country.</p>

<p>There&#39;s also no proof that Trump had anything to do with these activities. All we do know at least is that Trump cut ties (at least publicly) after the conviction for trafficking. </p>

<p>But this is STILL moot considering the whole thing is about one stupid quote from a magazine published almost 20 years ago. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>From your first source:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>former President Bill Clinton accepted an expanded role as special envoy for Haiti, on behalf of the United Nations, </p>

<p>In the course of a month, <strong>President Clinton</strong> brokered the release of all the missionaries, except for the group leader, Laura Silsby.48</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is not Hillary Clinton, this is Bill. And he specifically did not do anything for Laura Silsby. </p>

<p>Your second source is pay walled, but in the opening paragraphs says exactly the same thing:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The intervention of Bill Clinton, the former president, who is co-ordinating relief efforts in Haiti, may accelerate the resolution of an affair that has embarrassed the US government, dismayed relief agencies and angered many Haitians who believe their plight is being exploited by unscrupulous foreigners.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now for your other charge:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If it&#39;s so normal for the SoS to have daily updates</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I dont know where you get the idea of <em>daily</em> updates. I am aware of one or maybe two mentions of Silsby in the emails.</p>

<p>I would love you provide you with direct messages to Secretaries of State from subordinates about other Americans involved in high profile overseas scandals -- unfortunately wikileaks does not have or has not published the complete emails from all previous Secretaries of State.</p>

<p>I can certainly provide you with news accounts of other US citizen overseas scandals that involved high level US intervention that originated in the State Department. </p>

<p>[1994 Caning of a US Citizen for breaking Singapore laws](<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/26/us/us-student-tells-of-pain-of-his-caning-in-singapore.html">http://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/26/us/us-student-tells-of-pain-of-his-caning-in-singapore.html</a>]</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The caning strained Singapore&#39;s relations with the United States and has been seen as largely responsible for the United States&#39; voting against holding the first summit meeting of the World Trade Organization in Singapore next year.</p>

<p>The number of cane strokes in Fay&#39;s sentence was ultimately reduced from six to four after U.S. officials requested leniency.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.cnn.com/2013/07/04/world/detained-americans-fast-facts/">Here</a> is a list of all US nationals detained in high profile cases overseas. Note that all of these will involve regular updates in the SoS. Indeed, Clinton herself getting updates:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In a letter to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Defense Secretary Leon Panetta, 41 members of Congress urge the administration to withhold further aid to Egypt until the country&#39;s leadership lets the offices of those organizations reopen and returns seized property.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So in this case Im going to bet they were getting daily updates on these Americans charged with corruption in conjunction with being part of an NGO. </p>

<p>And again, from the same source, this time dealing with American students detained in Iran:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton meets with the detainees&#39; families.
So clearly, the SoS, including Clinton, take a personal interest in high profile cases, as is there job. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, high level State Department officials intervening in a foreign detention of Americans:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>June 30, 2014 - North Korea says that it plans to prosecute Fowle and another detained American tourist, Matthew Miller, accusing them of &quot;perpetrating hostile acts
October 21, 2014 - A senior State Department official tells CNN that Jeffrey Fowle has been released and is on his way home.</p>

<p>False. It literally says the exact opposite.  Gaslighting doesn&#39;t work anymore, champ.</p>

<p>False, the fact that Hillary had a personal connection was proven by the WL email.  You don&#39;t get to change the definition of that to &quot;were friends&quot;, as that was never the claim, champ.</p>

<p>You&#39;ve not provided a single example of <em>the Clintons</em> getting involved in a scandal.  Not one.  Show me where Bill (or Hillary) travelled to get anybody off of foreign charges that wasn&#39;t related to trafficking.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lol, Silsby was one of my first debunking posts on this sub. </p>

<p>Here, reposted for your delectation :</p>

<p>Headline is very misleading. </p>

<p>I saw a great comment about Silsby before:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I assume you&#39;re talking about <a href="https://wikileaks.org/clinton-emails/emailid/3539">this email</a>.</p>

<p>First off, we need some context.</p>

<p>Pizzagate investigators cite <a href="http://harvardhrj.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/King.pdf">this document</a> as proof that &quot;One of the first things the Clintons did when they took over the scene in Haiti was to have Bill get Laura off the hook.&quot;</p>

<p>But it&#39;s not true according to their own link. The linked document says:</p>

<p>Clinton brokered the release of all the missionaries, <strong>except for the group leader, Laura Silsby.</strong></p>

<p>Interesting non-essential side note, if you look at <a href="https://twitter.com/wikileaks/status/794247777756860417">this shameful, monumentally embarrassing tweet from Wikileaks</a> where they link to an early pizzagate thread on the_youknowwho, you can see the original formulation was that &quot;One of the first things <strong>Hillary</strong> did when she took over the scene in Haiti was get Laura Silsby off the hook...&quot; This has been edited to say &quot;the Clintons&quot; instead of &quot;Hillary&quot; because the linked 46-page document doesn&#39;t even mention Hillary&#39;s name. And besides, &quot;the Clintons took over the scene?&quot; The outcome for Silsby was determined by a trial with a judge and lawyers and testimony from the parents of the &quot;orphans&quot; and all kinds of neat non-Clinton-y stuff.</p>

<p>So what happened to Silby?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Despite Silsby’s stated intent to take the children over the border to an
unauthorized orphanage and her connections to human traffickers such as
Torres-Puello, the courts eventually dropped the kidnapping and criminal
association charges against her. Silsby was instead convicted under the
additional charge of organizing illegal travel, sentenced to time served (3
months and 8 days), and released on May 17, 2010. In the end, her sentence
was based on the least polemic charge against her. The pressing issue—whether
Silsby intended to deliver the children into trafficking rings
or grey adoption markets—was not addressed or resolved.</p>

<p>Rather than turning on Silsby’s actions, the decision in her case appeared
to turn on the actions of the parents. Judge Bernard Saint-Vil explained
that his decision was based on the Haitian parents’ testimony that they had
“[given] their kids away voluntarily.” Similarly, defense lawyer Jorge
Puello stated that the missionaries “willingly accepted kids they knew were
not orphans because the parents said they would starve otherwise.” Another
trial attorney for the missionaries, Aviol Fleurant, argued that “[t]he
parents’ testimony means no law was broken and ‘we can’t talk any more
about trafficking of human beings.’”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>More bombshells about the people who were &quot;trafficking in Haitian orphans,&quot; from the <em>same document.</em> Pizzagate investigators will never highlight or mention this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Americans denied any wrongdoing and said they had been trying to help children left orphaned and destitute by the Haitian earthquake. They said Puello had approached their relatives and church, offering his help.
It turned out that the children who were with the U.S. missionaries had living parents, many of whom testified they had voluntarily handed their offspring to the Americans in the hope they would be given an education and a better life.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Pizzagate theorists will point to a lawyer Torres to try to make Silsby and crew look worse, but just read this excerpt from an <a href="https://www.ice.gov/news/releases/fugitive-who-posed-lawyer-following-haitian-earthquake-sentenced-3-years-federal">ICE News Release</a> to put it all into context:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In early 2010, Torres surfaced in the Dominican Republic posing as a lawyer representing American church workers detained in Haiti in the wake of the earthquake in that country. <strong>Torres convinced a church that he was Jorge Torres Puello, an international lawyer and president of &quot;Puello Consulting&quot; in the Dominican Republic.</strong></p>

<p>Torres obtained a monetary retainer from the families of the detained missionaries and began representing himself to the Haitian court and international media as the attorney/spokesman for them. <strong>However, U.S. authorities recognized him as Jorge Torres when media reports showed images of the &quot;alleged&quot; lawyer wearing a suit and carrying a brief case.</strong></p>

<p>An extradition package was prepared and sent to representatives in the Dominican Republic. Torres was arrested, detained and extradited to the United States to face the 2003 alien smuggling charges in Vermont. He pleaded guilty to the charges.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To sum up this Torres business, the dude faked his identity, offered his services (as in HE approached THEM), bamboozled the missionaries, pretended to be their lawyer until he got extradited.</p>

<p>So Bill Clinton was asked to go in and straighten this business out. Hillary Clinton emailed someone for details about the situation. There are so many leaps that have to be made here to get to satanic-pedo-ritual-sex-slavery ring it&#39;s not even funny.</p>

<p>And so, after all this, Pizzagate investigators go berserk over this <a href="https://wikileaks.org/clinton-emails/emailid/3741">this email</a> &quot;where they are literally pricing how much it costs to transport children&quot; but <em>it&#39;s just a synopsis of a fucking charity organization.</em> Nothing more, nothing less. </p>

<p>He goes on forever about how Clinton didn&#39;t really intervene, and ignores the fact that the Clintons really did TRY to intervene when the rest of the crew was first negotiated, and the Haitian gov told them to stuff it.  Then they persisted, and finally got her out.  Just because they <em>failed</em> the first time does not in any way mean that the Clintons didn&#39;t try, fail, try again, and succeed.</p>

<p>His entire post is bullshit arguing of semantics in order to get people like you to buy into the &quot;post fact&quot; crap.</p>

<p>Do you know how many groups of missionaries and/or non-profit charity groups have been in and out of Haiti for literally decades? If anything, this is more evidence against the ridiculous Pizzagate assertion - if Silsby and crew had the intention of using the melee following a huge national disaster to kidnap/steal children for horrible purposes, how did they know to be in the country before this unexpected disaster happened?</p>

<p>The Haitians found that they were there before the earthquake, and that all of the children except one had living parents, called bullshit, and formally charged them with child trafficking.</p>

<p>They could not be there to save earthquake victims if they were there gathering children before the earthquake.</p>

<p>The Haitian government found this to be a simple concept.</p>

<p>They were convicted because their lawyer told that judge that the children were orphans, when instead, they were freely given to the missionaries by the parents.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re paying attention to all the pedophile busts going down (you&#39;re not), people who are trafficking kids for sex don&#39;t suddenly give them their freedom or a free ticket to college when they turn 18.  People running sex trafficking rings are not known for taking the high ground when it comes to kids.</p>

<p>Good thing I did nothing of the sort.  Rather, I tie human sex traffickers to pedophiles.  You&#39;re a terrible person for defending them, and that&#39;s got nothing to do with gay.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you, I&#39;ve been dying to ask this question, but I figured I&#39;d get mowed over for asking it. The math just doesn&#39;t make sense to me. </p>

<p>I&#39;d love for someone to explain how even .01% of the US voting population could be in any way persuaded by anything in this subreddit. </p>

<p>Like 130,000,000 people voted in November. So 
.01% would be 13,000. The occasional post that makes it to front page might get 15,000 upvotes.
Best I can tell, most say that opponents are either bots or shills, so those wouldn&#39;t count. At very least 80% of the real people already have their minds made up. That leaves a few hundred pliable minds that somebody is apparently spending a literal fortune on.</p>

<p>And a few hundred votes would barely swing a single precinct in a single battleground county in a single battleground state...<em>if</em> they all happened to be from there, which they aren&#39;t. </p>

<p>What am I missing?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No lie. They moved in here pretty quick. Must only be a few accounts. I noticed only the few same accounts commenting and each account had either 4 or 6 upvotes and everything promoting the existence of p gate is at a solid -1. And not a single account that&#39;s in here denying the existence of p gate will explain why they want to waste their time arguing about something they don&#39;t believe in on an online platform. I still don&#39;t see what they have to gain by being here arguing with us- I guess some people literally have nothing better to do and there&#39;s no way they&#39;re paid to be here. Hell I saw a one week old account commenting like crazy up there. Must be a crazy coincidence to make a reddit account a week ago, and spend that whole week learning everything about p gate and then spending time after learning about it to come to the comments and deny it violently. </p>

<p>More like collection of NAMBLA advertisements.</p>

<p>I picked up a cheap subscription via a slickdeals thread a couple years ago, because everybody was saying it had articles on how to dress better.</p>

<p>That was wrong.</p>

<p>A solid 75% of the magazine was half dressed teenage boys showing off their nipples and the top of their fresh trim on their privates staring lustfully at the photographer in alcohol or cologne advertisements.</p>

<p>The other 25% was articles about the latest movie star projects and what alcohol they drank and cologne they wore.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is literally no point in arguing with you because multiple people in this post are meeting your challenges and proving you wrong, and you follow it up by either ignoring them, talking past them (people aren&#39;t denying that Brock and Alefantis dated, they&#39;re denying the bs Pizzagate accusations and you&#39;ve have to be stupid not to get that), or shifting the goal posts.</p>

<p>You&#39;re not actually asking people to debate. You simply want an echo chamber.</p>

<p>Trump constantly had Epstein over to his house for &quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;Dinner&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot; and there were multiple secret numbers for Trump found in Epsteins ledger. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I like how you&#39;re so stupid that you equate circumstantial evidence to a &quot;negative&quot; that can&#39;t be proved or disproved. What I&#39;m saying is that it&#39;s blatantly obvious that you are either being purposely disingenuous or you&#39;re actually just a cunt that talks about the burden of proof like you know what it means or how it is actually applied to a real situation when you&#39;re just completely ignorant. The burden of proof shows that you are adding nothing to the conversation and you have no argument against us but you lie and pretend you have facts backing you when it&#39;s really obvious you&#39;re supported by a house of cards. Please do everyone a favor and shut the fuck up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not clear he took it even once. The &quot;one time&quot; thing only came from Mark Epstein, Jeff&#39;s brother, who could have been lying. None of the actual flight logs show Trump on Epstein&#39;s plane. Clinton shows up a ton however.</p>

<p>Victim Virginia Roberts said that Trump only came to Epstein&#39;s house once.</p>
