    <div class="md"><p>One day I wrote a one-liner in a random thread about Bernie Sanders (I think that was the subject) and I basically just said that we don&#39;t need any of these archetypal government systems and we&#39;d be better off without them. Even socialism.</p>

<p>Flytape comes in and starts posting as a regular user with long, rambling rants directed at me and implying that I&#39;m an ignorant Bernie Sanders supporter. All of his responses seemed pre-written and meant for a Bernie supporter rather than me and I spent most of the time asking wtf he was trying to say because it made no sense. At that point he switched to posting under his mod profile and began to threaten banning me because of my confusion. He was literally talking to himself at one point so I called him psychotic, and that was enough for him to whip out his e-dick and start acting like a Demi-god. Needless to say I just moved on after a while because it really felt like I was talking to a chat bot and not a human being. He ended the thread repeatedly claiming that I was &quot;just crying&quot;. That was probably the most confusing situation I&#39;ve ever had on Reddit.</p>

<p>If I&#39;m banned for sharing this experience it&#39;ll be proof that the mods are corrupt.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I truly mean no offense, but I&#39;m not going to argue or be baited into saying something banworthy here. This isn&#39;t the first time users have complained about strange mod behavior from one particular mod, and I&#39;m not personally attacking anyone. I made it very clear that I was mostly just confused at this mod&#39;s behavior and wasn&#39;t starting an offensive discussion or asking that anything be done at all. I was just sharing my experience and at least 6-7 people agreed with me at one point. I say all this because I don&#39;t wish to speak with any mod further and I want it to be clear what&#39;s going on here. Screencapping as this progresses. Peace.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m really not trying to bait you, but I can understand that perception. If you want to PM me that&#39;s fine; if not, that&#39;s fine too. I probably remove more comments than most active mods but I ban far less. If anything, I would take an accusation without proof as being worse than an accusation with proof, but I&#39;m not going to hold either against you since this thread was allowed to stay up in the first place. It&#39;s fair game in my book. </p>

<p>Screen capping this conversation? I&#39;d say that&#39;s not a bad idea. Always good to keep evidence of any potential mod abuse. I&#39;d recommend using archive.is, though. It&#39;s more credible as it can&#39;t be easily edited. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What? So you&#39;re assuming I&#39;m stupid and think that mods can&#39;t see deleted comments? That&#39;s not why I removed some of my comments. I just want nothing to do with you because of the strange rambling accusations you threw at me without even reading what I wrote back. That honestly freaked me out the way you literally ignored me and talked to yourself about socialism. To the very end you were adamant that I&#39;m a Bernie supporter trying to support socialism even though I repeatedly told you otherwise. I&#39;ve never once made a thread supporting Bernie. Not to mention your incessant and unprofessional use of phrases like &quot;bruh&quot; and &quot;you&#39;re just crying&quot; and reminders of your mod powers as a means to argue with people you don&#39;t agree with. What a nightmare. I&#39;m not alone either. I&#39;ve had multiple people message me as a result of this thread supporting my comments. Here&#39;s someone else that had a major issue with your behavior that you banned:</p>
