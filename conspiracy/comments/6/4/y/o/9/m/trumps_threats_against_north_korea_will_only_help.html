        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>North Korea has spent 60 plus years convincing their people the US is an existential threat to their existence, aiding their efforts to control, brainwash, and militarize their society. Now, with Trump dropping all pretense of diplomacy, openly threatening the country, things will only get worse for the North Korean people. </p>

<p>In a perfect (unattainable) world, some semblance of political democracy and choice would be available for North Koreans-- instead they have a merit and bloodline-based ideological monarchy, a mixture of religious-type devotion/cult of personality masquerading as a supposedly pure socialist utopia, riddled with paranoia and zero allowable dissent. It sucks, obviously, and doesn&#39;t look to be shifting any time soon. </p>

<p>But Trump, also obviously, does not help matters. The absurd double standard of calling on nations to be MORE nuclear-capable while strictly condemning such developments in scenarios the US doesn&#39;t like (sticking with Bush&#39;s &quot;Axis of Evil&quot;)...hypocrisy doesn&#39;t begin to cover it. </p>

<p>Further, if an antagonistic relationship with South Korea, Japan, and the US has allowed the North Korean regime to exercise strict, militarized control over their people, Trump threatening to intervene in typical dick-wagging world police fashion isn&#39;t going to help. If anything, control and paranoia and psycho patriotism will only increase, and the North Korean people will suffer more. Saber-ratting and ruling by threat and fear is already a staple of Trumpism. Is he trying to provoke the regime into hasty action, thus permitting outsized response? What kind of &quot;deal maker&quot; follows a meeting with China&#39;s president by issuing a war-like threat to China&#39;s ally, over Twitter? The threat of war has never helped any situation, and it won&#39;t in this case. </p>

<p>The North Koreans are so mentally ill from years of brainwashing it is very unlikely they could be &quot;rehabilitated&quot;. China does not want millions of insane North Koreans fleeing into China. South Korea cannot absorb them into their society. So, what should be done with them? We may witness a mass genocide to get rid of them.</p>

<p>Incorrect.  </p>

<p>On <strong>September 9, 2016</strong>, North Korea carried out a fifth nuclear test. [87] The U.S. Geological Survey registered the test as a 5.3 magnitude earthquake. [88] The test coincided with the 68th anniversary of the formation of North Korea. [89] Shortly afterwards, North Korea released a defiant statement warning its &quot;enemies&quot; that it now has the capability to produce a warhead small enough to fit onto the end of a missile and can retaliate against any attack.   </p>

<p>So, what to do about NK nukes and NK threatening to use nukes on other countries? </p>

<p>Many nations have the capability of nuking the US... why is North Korea different?</p>

<p>How does the US avoid being nuked by the Russians or Chinese? It avoids confrontation with them. So why is the US seemingly provoking a confrontation with a nation capable of nuking them? Does it <em>want</em> to be nuked by North Korea? Because that&#39;s how you get nuked by North Korea.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Biggest fear worst case hypothetical scenario: </p>

<p>North Korea&#39;s nuclear capabilities have been misreported for years and they are fully ready to hit the US with a long range nuke. The government allows a nuclear missile to hit California (conveniently taking out a lot of opposition to the current regime). The US is then justified to use nuclear weapons to flatten North Korea, and no one in the international community would stop them. Then saying that &quot;we couldn&#39;t allow our enemies to replicate this horrible attack on our soil, we had to eradicate our enemies in the fastest way possible&quot; the US will preemptively nuke China, Russia, and a couple middle eastern countries. Clearing out our list of enemies and leaving no opposition to US dominance around the world. </p>
