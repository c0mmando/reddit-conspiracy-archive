       North Korea has spent 60 plus years convincing their people the US is an existential threat to their existence, aiding their efforts to control, brainwash, and militarize their society. Now, with Trump dropping all pretense of diplomacy, openly threatening the country, things will only get worse for the North Korean people.
      </p>
      <p>
       In a perfect (unattainable) world, some semblance of political democracy and choice would be available for North Koreans-- instead they have a merit and bloodline-based ideological monarchy, a mixture of religious-type devotion/cult of personality masquerading as a supposedly pure socialist utopia, riddled with paranoia and zero allowable dissent. It sucks, obviously, and doesn't look to be shifting any time soon.
      </p>
      <p>
       But Trump, also obviously, does not help matters. The absurd double standard of calling on nations to be MORE nuclear-capable while strictly condemning such developments in scenarios the US doesn't like (sticking with Bush's "Axis of Evil")...hypocrisy doesn't begin to cover it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Further, if an antagonistic relationship with South Korea, Japan, and the US has allowed the North Korean regime to exercise strict, militarized control over their people, Trump threatening to intervene in typical dick-wagging world police fashion isn't going to help. If anything, control and paranoia and psycho patriotism will only increase, and the North Korean people will suffer more. Saber-ratting and ruling by threat and fear is already a staple of Trumpism. Is he trying to provoke the regime into hasty action, thus permitting outsized response? What kind of "deal maker" follows a meeting with China's president by issuing a war-like threat to China's ally, over Twitter? The threat of war has never helped any situation, and it won't in this case.

       I think the Chinese have been bought. Trump made them a "deal" they couldn't refuse.

       The North Koreans are so mentally ill from years of brainwashing it is very unlikely they could be "rehabilitated". China does not want millions of insane North Koreans fleeing into China. South Korea cannot absorb them into their society. So, what should be done with them? We may witness a mass genocide to get rid of them.

       Fuck, you may be more right than you know. Recall Prince's Blackwater successor "Frontier Services Group" is inking deals to provide "security" in China, while also working in Southern Europe to keep refugees out. Apply the same concept to N Korea/China and reactionary massacres, knowing Prince's track record, are not inconceivable.

       Cause and effect. What would the US do/say if the Chinese, or whoever, teamed up with Mexico and were holding military drills on our boarder practicing invading the US? And threatened to assassinate our president? And had an armada of destroyer ships heading to the gulf of mexico?
      </p>
      <p>
       To me it seems everything NK is/has done is because the US has backed them into a corner. The US caused every reaction.

       <strong>
        September 9, 2016
       </strong>
       , North Korea carried out a fifth nuclear test. [87] The U.S. Geological Survey registered the test as a 5.3 magnitude earthquake. [88] The test coincided with the 68th anniversary of the formation of North Korea. [89] Shortly afterwards, North Korea released a defiant statement warning its "enemies" that it now has the capability to produce a warhead small enough to fit onto the end of a missile and can retaliate against any attack.

       I have no idea. I guess I'd start with WHY they have said that shit/what their stated reasons are for nuclear development, not hastily react to the statements themselves. Maybe they are truly beyond help and are fully, suicidally insane...their past record of actual international actions and attacks is pretty sparse, though, so it's a debtable

       They've been threatening nuke war for a long time which proves nothing "hasty" has been done. So, now we're back to what to do about NK now having the capabilities to nuke the USA?

       Many nations have the capability of nuking the US... why is North Korea different?
      </p>
      <p>
       How does the US avoid being nuked by the Russians or Chinese? It avoids confrontation with them. So why is the US seemingly provoking a confrontation with a nation capable of nuking them? Does it
       <em>
        want
       </em>
       to be nuked by North Korea? Because that's how you get nuked by North Korea.

       The united states will literally turn off the lights,control their internet,control their TV broadcast,and drop leaflets promoting freedom and sanctuary to all north Koreans prior to any bombing campaign.
      </p>
      <p>
       Kim Jung will be assassinated and north and south Korea will be unified. Two states one country.

       When the hell did Trump want any other nation to be more nuclear capable? Your theories are a little too far out there man. Your defending a well known crazy dictator who has threatened other nations with nuclear war....

       Biggest fear worst case hypothetical scenario:
      </p>
      <p>
       North Korea's nuclear capabilities have been misreported for years and they are fully ready to hit the US with a long range nuke. The government allows a nuclear missile to hit California (conveniently taking out a lot of opposition to the current regime). The US is then justified to use nuclear weapons to flatten North Korea, and no one in the international community would stop them. Then saying that "we couldn't allow our enemies to replicate this horrible attack on our soil, we had to eradicate our enemies in the fastest way possible" the US will preemptively nuke China, Russia, and a couple middle eastern countries. Clearing out our list of enemies and leaving no opposition to US dominance around the world.

       I mean the situation in North Korea has been a problem for years, everyone knows it and the problem is only getting worse and becoming more global.
      </p>
      <p>
       I feel like Trump wants to be the hero president that set in motion the climax and ultimate solution to the Korea problem, knowing that when shit hits the fan, it will be mostly China's problem.
