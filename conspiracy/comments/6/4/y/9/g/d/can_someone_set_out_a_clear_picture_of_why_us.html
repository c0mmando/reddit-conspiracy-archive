       The Assad family has been killing Syrians since the 1970's, but the reality is that this is just what governments do, particularly in the Middle East, and especially so when fighting civil wars against partisans funded, armed, and (today) manned by foreign powers.

       you seem smarter than to buy into the two-party sham... Trump is only there to troll folks like you (and the MSM). Don't worry, you can have your WWIII, you just have to wait a few more years... stand by for political purges in the near term. blue team is going to get eviscerated by corruption probes. I have been tuned out of the MSM for a decade, now... lately, I have been tuning in because the fear and loathing is strangely satisfying.
      </p>
      <p>
       Globalists forgot whose team US is supposed to be on (the chosen)... Libya, Syria, and Ukraine were one thing - that coup that they tried on Erdogan was the straw that broke the camel's back. mark my words, the blues will find hell to pay over the next few years. Trump's job is to "right the ship" so everything is in line for WWIII. Schiff's Russia play is the inside job that will bring it all into the open. FBI (globalists' last line of defense) will be purged as well. Whatever you do, if you go to protests, make sure you bring lots of Pepsi...

       want ww3... it has been planned for a long time (since 1872, at least). Zionism v Islam at the top of the card. Right now, we are still watching undercard fights (US globalist acolytes vs. Zionist allainace). This particular fight is fixed... it will play out over years, but it is now a done deal. Trump's impeachment (which I am expecting at some point) will make no matter at all. it will be at least 8 years before the globalists can hope to control the executive apparatus again. that opportunity will arrive 5-6 years too late. I don't want WW3, either, but it's almost time...

       like WWs 1 and 2, it will be global. I would expect it to go nuclear, because that seems to be the most efficient way of killing large numbers (which is one of the ultimate goals - Georgia guidestones-like). Jesus can be hologrammed - might be planned as an end of the war. Personally, I don't believe in any religion - I think Nietzche had it right when he called Christianity and Judaism "slave religions." All throughout my lifetime, governments and press agencies have worked hard to make as much of the Revelations "come true" as possible. As a disbeliever, I think that the agenda is to scare the religious into submission and to gaslight their belief that these are End Times. I'm surprised that you see it as legit belief instead of the  obvious psyop that it is...

       I might have misunderstood you. I interpreted your last two sentences as ridicule of religious types for their seeing the End Times. Their belief is not because they are crazy, but because they are being gaslighted by government and media End Times psyops (which are still continuing). The bottom line is that these things are the result of careful management, not the natural result of independent thought and conclusions. Just like partisan division, it is artfully done to give the ideas credibility in the minds of the believers.
      </p>

       I have no idea how WW3 goes down. My guess is that a lot of people are sacrificed to Ba'al or Moloch (again). My guess is the traditional theaters for WWs 1 and 2, Most of Europe (after breakup of EU), east Asia (Korean peninsula, especially), and MENA, as usual.

       And I think it's important to, if you want anyone to give credit to your claim that WW3 is nigh and has been planned all along, to have some idea of how it would play out... otherwise, makes your statement just seem like the ravings of a lunatic.

       If the battle is happening in Europe, its who's on what side there?

       And the battle happening
       <em>
        on
       </em>
       the Korean Peninsula? If it's world war 3, it's not proxy battles between puppet states. We'd be
       <em>
        at war with china
       </em>
       , not just North Korea. Why would we fight them in Korea?

      <p>
       Or, if war with puppet states is a world war, then we'd be on like... idk... world war 8 right now and there's nothing to worry about anyone nuking anyone.

      <p>
       can be... but I give people the benefit of the doubt for being fooled when everything is set up to ensure that outcome.
      </p>
      <p>
       I might be a raving lunatic... I
       <em>
        am
       </em>
       commenting in r/conspiracy, after all. Here's the short version of how I came to this conclusion (no answers on how it goes down, except some ideas)... We can probably agree that our ability to
       <em>
        know
       </em>
       things is severely limited, but being a literature kind of guy, I feel like I have gotten pretty good at tracking narratives in the media. The first difference where the narrative is obviously flawed is the Great Recovery. If you surfed MSM headlines between 2009 and 2016, you probably noticed a whole bunch of BS... lots of people did. The Great Recovery was a feat of goal-seeking and lockstep media reporting. Enter the 2016 election... by now, lots of people know that the news is full of shit (WMD lies, Benghazi, Haiti, and endless droning of Syria). MSM says Orange will never win... Orange wins... Dude is/was totally flawed (asset of Mossad, 3x bankrupt billionaire, calls Iran the greatest threat, plus that ridiculous wall idea) but as the lesser of 2 evils, he ascends to the WH. As a PGer and a generally "woke" guy, I have followed George Webb since around November (death of Monica Petersen got me looking at him). The story is now
       <em>
        totally
       </em>
       different than it was before... originally, he was onto Dyncorp and human trafficking in Haiti and Kosovo, also pointing out corruption of USAID in projects in Haiti, which benefitted Clinton, Rodham, Giustra, and other cronies. Today, he is solely on this ISI/Gulen mango and intel connection through the DNC. Dyncorp is still around and in business (not to mention, in the Orange administration)- Webb stays mostly mum about them today. How did he go from Braverman to Awans? I think that he is being fed info by some interested party. Ultimately, it will end in political purges for corruption, but that will be a limited hangout and the majority of criminal networks (maybe pedos, probably drugs and intelligence) will remain in order.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then you have Europe... all that immigration, mandated by the EU (and US wars) as another form of gaslighting. Facebook censors posts about Muslims raping whites... Every "terror attack" is carried out by Muslims. Can you see the natural buildup of resentment? A few weeks ago, I posted that I think that they are being set up for a new Holocaust (this time against Muslims). Antisemitic (Muslims being Semites, too) headlines and dispositions are eerily similar to those of Europe in the 1930s... not to mention that EU is about to fracture... In France, Italy, England, and Hungary "neo-nationalist" parties are popping up with angry whites (who like to march, apparently). Historically Europeans
       <em>
        love
       </em>
       fighting amongst themselves... "Neo-nationalism" is already being set up as the fall guy for the breakup of the EU and the ensuing wars. A realistic look at any one of these leaders will show that they are not nationalists... many of them are political Zionists.

       It was in my thread about the coming Holocaust in Europe that somebody turned me on to Albert Pike's letter to Mazzini (allegedly transcribed by William Guy Carr in1872). in the letter, he gives brief narratives of the coming World Wars (the first two he got pretty good - but not quite perfect - but we are talking about
       <em>
        narrative,
       </em>
       not reality). The last of which is supposed to bring the 1 government, religion, and currency. Citing how much I have seen MSM and government try to make Revelations "come true," the truly Zionist nature of most of the "neo-nationalist" leaders (especially Orange), the current military buildups and mobilizations, I'd say that it all looks like a pretty good setup. The only thing that we are missing is a major asset "correction" which will make the economic pain visible to and reportable by the MSM. People don't mind war so much in the bad economy because they need jobs.

       As for Asia, don't count out the fact that they are quite happy to fight among themselves...
       <a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2017-04-12/china-threatens-north-korea-never-seen-measures-if-they-dont-de-escalate">
        I think Orange told Xi to check his boy
       </a>
       . Asia holds most of the world's people (and they always have - as such, they have a historically lower regard for human life than their Western counterparts). As for outcomes, maybe the big powers patrol their own backyards for a few years before the big showdown. I have really just started putting this together for a few weeks. I do expect that the correction/crash takes place this year. citing the fact that the benchmark interest rate was raised for the
       <em>
        second time in a decade
       </em>
       , plus they are allegedly going to start shrinking the FED's balance sheet this year,
       <em>
        and
       </em>
       the evergreen stock market has flattened out since the hike (but maybe
       <em>
        this
       </em>
       time it's different? heheheheh)...
      </p>
      <p>
       Not sure what you know about NDAA and Patriot Act... they are proof that
       <em>
        we the people
       </em>
       are the biggest security risk of all. Only TV heads and angry, gaslighted, blue-pilled Euros are really afraid of Islamic terror. The agenda is depopulation (particularly of physically and mentally capable males). I don't know how we get there, but the writing is on the wall that there are
       <em>
        way too many
       </em>
       of us for them to keep busy and controlled. Automation also changes the game for how many plebes the elites need in order to have all that they want/need. Our primary function is now as livestock (organs, sex, and management). Tech nerds think that AI will also reduce the need for the "management class"... I dunno about that, but I am pretty sure that we are about to see the greatest population control plan in history come to fruition within a few years. Any thoughts would be appreciated.

       I think you make a lot of great points.
      </p>
      <p>
       But with regards to the world versus Islam, this isn't anything new.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since world war 1, it's been a controlled plan  to keep it destabilized and fight a crusade every few years.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, I don't really see how War in Europe comes out of this tho, or the Korean Peninsula.
      </p>
      <p>
       We may very well see a rounding up of Muslims, but that's far from the war you're describing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, I'm not sure where you're going with your depopulation idea. I don't see any action go rid the world of healthy white males, tho the diversity push is annoying, I think that's more of an attempt to bring about peace because they know that as long as there's distinct culture we hate each other. I think they honestly believe that having a bunch of mulattos running around won't be a bad thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, especially post oil, we may see an all out war with the Middle East when we don't need them anymore, but I still don't see where that leaves up with the big population problems of India and China.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can't see any initiative to address those population problems from our end, mostly just hope they reduce their population growth themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, yea, I see where you're coming from on a lot of your points, I just don't see where you're going, why, and how they're gonna get there.

       Thanks for the feedback. Your points are solid, too.
      </p>
      <p>
       Despite the official narrative(s), I think that the US is approaching post-racial society... I don't think that the culling is reserved for whites only (or any particular race).
      </p>
      <p>
       The international banking class has repeatedly sold the League of Nations and the UN as means to stop all wars and to bring "peace and prosperity" to the world.  Prior to the Spanish-American War, the United States had a fiercely isolationist policy with regards to European politics. The Roosevelts and Wilson changed all of that. The same voices that raged against US involvement in WW1 and 2 were the originators of the (American) narrative about the "international conspiracy to bring about the New World Order." This is an old narrative in American history - original to the John Birch society and other groups that opposed US interventionism.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyhow, you are right that there don't seem many sensible paths to get there. Just the same, I believe that this is the result of planning and execution, not reasonable outcomes. If post EU breakup leads to war on the European continent - say maybe Turks go after Greeks or Bulgars, would you be any more inclined to believe that WW3 is the/an agenda?

       I just don't know. I imagine the war you're describing is with the whole 1st world teaming up against Islam (which has happened before, many times)
      </p>
      <p>
       As it currently is, Islam would be decimated quick... and wouldn't serve any of the other goals you are talking about.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean, sure it's security for Israel, but what happens to all the civilian Muslims?
      </p>
      <p>
       We wipe them all out and leave the desert barren?
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if Europe breaks up, the actual powers that be would all be on the same side (UK/France/Germany/Italy/Russian/US/Canada) against Islam, wouldn't we?
      </p>
      <p>
       Or are you saying that Muslim influence in Germany would be so strong that they would join the Muslims?
      </p>
      <p>
       If not, Turkey, along with any conglomerate of Islamic countries would get trounced in a war, with western casualties being likely less than 50,000 for a completely annihilation of Islamic forces/Islamic population, even without nukes.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, if you're saying the war will be in the balkans into the ME with Islam, you're gonna need to pick a world power that would join their side of the fight.
      </p>
      <p>
       (I would assume you'd argue Russia or China, but I would need some convincing argument that they would join... some catasphrofic event, such as a Pearl Harbor 9/11 level event, perpetrated by western powers against them would get them to join Islam, which... why would we do that? Pearl Harbor happened because we were supporting the island nations against Japanese aggression, could their stand-off support for Middle Eastern countries really be significant enough that would warrant us to attack them directly? I don't think so. No matter how much support Russia or China gave middle eastern countries, in an open total war, the allied nations would trounce them handily)

       I think that this will be more the narrative within the countries that participate in Muslim persecution, and that narrative is really meant for interpreting the war after the fact (like what happened with the Holocaust in WWII). You are right that the current structure would pit developed nations against Muslim ones (which would not be much of a war, at all). Still, I think that there is plenty of room for this to happen. Here's my attempt at explanation:
      </p>
      <p>
       China and Germany are export economies. Their problems will compound when nobody can afford their goods anymore (it's already happening, and the coming correction could seal the deal). In order to keep people employed, they shift to military production/buildup. For Germany, the movement to arms could be for 2 reasons: 1) recouping unpaid Target2 debts (which will be huge in the inevitable EU breakup), and 2) maybe to liberate Muslims in camps in the rest of Europe.
       <a href="http://blogs.reuters.com/data-dive/2015/03/31/all-the-oil-in-china/">
        As of 2013
       </a>
       , China is actually
       <em>
        more
       </em>
       dependent than US on petroleum from ME (see their imports by country
       <a href="http://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/The-Battle-For-Chinas-Oil-Market.html">
        here
       </a>
       - scroll down for the pie chart for imports by country). In this sense, we can see that instability in the ME might actually coax the Chinese to do something geo-politically out of character (that thing being force projection far from their borders). I think that US invasion of Persia could be the catalyst there - especially so if the US (for some reason) denies China access to the Iraqi spigot - or maybe if insurgency kills the output.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for Turkey and Germany, they have been on the same side of the last 2 iterations of this ritual. I think that Greek or Bulgarian mistreatment of Muslims could inspire action - plus the traditional territorial disputes with Greece. Also, I think that you underestimate the military might and acumen of the Turks. Their continuous, internal war on Kurds has their military much more honed and ready than the most of Europe. The sum of European combat operations since French Indo-China has been as ghost-puppet members of NATO coalitions.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think that you are right about Allies beating the pariah states (plus China) if it all went down today. With a few years of mobilization, though, it could be a completely different story. The Russo-Chinese border is the longest protected border in the world. The mistrust between these nations is old and deep-seated. Also true is that Germany depends on Russia for natgas (until the new pipeline is completed). This is why the (German-led) EU mostly antagonizes Russia between March and September. If that pipeline isn't completed in 5 years, and Russia gets Ukraine back under control, that could also be a source of conflict. Resentment of Germany from junior EU members is pretty strong, especially in PIIGS. Another development that might affect the outcome of war (even today) is the porous nature of US intel/counterintel operations, which could be an Achilles heel to the American Empire. All we can do is watch and wait, I guess... I agree that many developments will need to happen before this can come to fruition...
      </p>

       Thanks for participating with me and helping me to think this out! This has been extremely constructive for me. Cheers!

       You're welcome! I do enjoy conspiracy, but I also think it's important to either have the whole thing fleshed out, or to keep it simple and vague.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like, I believe LBJ knew about the assassination, but theories abound after that.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also believe that most of the intelligence we receive from Israel is intentionally misleading so that we'll carry out their agenda.
      </p>
      <p>
       Things like 9/11, I'm cool saying the hijackers were Mossad or that there were possibly charges in the building. What I don't get is the people who say the planes didn't strike the buildings. Like, there's levels... and I sometimes think those who go to far are either trolling or paid shills to discredit actual inquiry.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, yea, I okay seeing that we're headed towards WW3, but I'd like to know what that would look like.
      </p>
      <p>
       Personally, I don't think the people would do it... not white on white. I think we've had enough of that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, china... it could happen, but not for awhile. They're still just too week to fight a forward war and we've got no reason to attack them.
      </p>
      <p>
       A straight out nuclear war
       <em>
        could
       </em>
       happen, but it would be completely unprecedented in human history and need to be carefully coordinated and planned, and also
       <em>
        agreed upon
       </em>
       by all major factors, and solely used as depopulation. But if that's the case, we'd focus first on India and Africa, as overpopulation isn't really a problem yet in the US and the concentrated population centers are your pro-globalism crowd. So, if you
       <em>
        were
       </em>
       to take them out, what you'd have left is a bunch of unruly country bumpkins... not sure what good that would do in the sense of being better for anyone besides those country bumpkins!

don't be fooled. whites are most vicious and violent of all of the races. I think history backs me up on this one (body count). i think it has to do with recessive traits needing to get out in nature (hence the soulless Ginger and the berserking Vikings).

re-wilding large portions of the world - like North America, as happened in A Brave New World. Great for eco-harmony and tourism. I would be a happy savage!

       But whites haven't fought each other since globalism/world war 2.

       Every single fight since then has either been exclusively other races, or whites vs non-whites.

       Mostly true... except that Slavs messed each other real good in the Balkans, and Ukraine is having a civil right now (but some argue that both groups are essentially
       <em>
        less
       </em>
       European)... The breakup of the EU might look very much like Balkanization. At the very least, you can rest assured that it will be a financial disaster. Unemployed young men, being dangerous to the existing order, are shipped out in armies. The way you put it, though, makes me I agree that this would be the most surprising development of all (western Euro vs western Euro)... Europe can barely handle any more unemployment... the youth rates in Portugal, Spain, and Italy are already through the charts. If there's a buck in it (and more important, a law that says they
       <em>
        must
       </em>
       ), then it
       <em>
        will

       happen, IMO.

       What does that have to do with the United States? Is the United States the world's policemen? Since when does the U.S. care about Syrians? Do they care about the one million Iraqis George W. Bush murdered?

       I seem to recall millions marching against the Iraq war but of course people cared about the deaths. Do you recall the furore over WMDs and subsequent outrage? Or the outrage at Wikileaks footage of an apache lighting up some dudes?

       The international community can only stand by idly for so long before intervention is required. Dropping chemical weapons on civilians is the sort of action that tips the international consensus towards intervention. Driven by the US perhaps but supported by a broad coalition of western powers.

       You are assuming that Assad used chemical weapons on his own people, which has never been proven. Logical arguments are being made that he didn't gas his own people. The only people that want Assad out are the neocons and the Israelis. Which one are you?

       I'm sure if you took a straw poll of Syrians that have fled Aleppo you would find many want murderous Assad gone.

       There are a number of reasons why Assad is being targeted. But, above all, it has to do with Israel's desire to destabilise the Middle East for its own ends. The Oded Yinon strategy makes enlightening reading.

       And other rulers and dictators do that in other countries, and the U.S. gives no fucks. Look at some countries in Africa for example. The U.S. gets involved for oil or other natural resources, because they're a threat to maintaining the Petrodollar as the dominant world currency, or because Saudi Arabia or Israel wants us to. There has never been a country in the middle east that was left in better condition after we left it after a regime change. Educate yourself.

       This is what I have gathered from various posts around here.
      </p>
      <p>
       Israel wants a chunk of Syria for "Greater Israel". Israel also has a pipeline to Europe planned so they can sell the petroleum they stole from Palestine. This pipeline plan is competing with an alternative Russia plan. Also, Assad wanted to move their currency to the dinar, and they are one of the very few countries that matter who don't have a Rothschilds central bank. If al that weren't bad enough, Assad is Shiite muslim, which is directly opposed to the Israel alined muslims of Saudi Arabia, the wahabbist Sunni.
      </p>
      <p>
       Assad is also fairly liberal and tolorant of other religions. Can't have that.

       Let's put it this way, if the U.S. wanted Assad 'gone' he'd be dead.  The reason the civil war has dragged on appears to be because
       <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20040501135413/http://www.iasps.org/strat1.htm">
        rolling Syria back in power has been a geopolitical goal in certain ideological circles since the mid-90's
       </a>
       .  I don't doubt there are territorial aspirations at play here too, like
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golan_Heights">
        this area
       </a>
       for example - Assad doesn't need to be dead for that to happen though, just weakened enough that he can't do anything about its loss.

       I think we may be missing the power and influence of secret societies/mystery schools in this situation as well, especially on the Arab/Persian side. I'd be curious to learn more about the secret societies existing on the Arab/Muslim side, in similar stature to the Secretum Secretorum/Black Nobility/Jesuits/Knights of Malta/Order of St. John of Jerusalem.

       Sure, when a country in the middle east sells oil that is fine. When a country in the middle east sells oil but decides they do not want to use the US dollar that is
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       fine. If someone could manipulate the value of their own currency or trade oil for things that are not imaginary USD then they can become quite powerful. They also weaken the USD because others have a reason to stop having USD since they can buy oil in some other guys currency or trade with them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Saddam, Gaddafi, and Assad all stopped using the dollar.
      </p>
      <p>
       That is reason number 1. That is a a reason both sides of the aisle want him gone.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       Reason number two is even more simple to understand. Saudi Arabia sells a lot of oil. The globalists want SA to be able to sell their oil in the EU. A pipeline is trying to be made through the region and Syria is right smack in the middle of where the pipeline would go. The EU is just a globalists wet dream. It is their huge pet project. Russia is an enemy of the EU and sells a lot of oil. So both of these parties want different things. One wants the pipeline and the other does not. The Russian economy would be devastated if the pipeline got put in. Assad does
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       want this pipeline. Russia is backing him to because they also do not want it.
      </p>
      <p>
       The globalists want to destabilize the area so they can install a puppet and allow the pipeline. So you have tons of people who want the pipeline: SA, EU, politicians paid of by SA. etc. They all need Assad gone to do this. They need the public to accept taking out Assad. They are trying to accomplish this with false flags, pictures of dying kids, and the msm pushing that narrative. It's pushing the world to WW3 because Russia will be crushed by the EU and their sanctions if oil is no longer needed. They will just cut them off till they starve and then force them to pick a new leader who is also a puppet. Then the EU who is not elected will control all of the area and do whatever the hell it likes. I'm sure the long term goal is the weaken the USA and have them join the EU too.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       This is all fact not theory. I know this place is for theories but this is pretty much widely accepted and known. Outside of these issues you have other people clamoring for war because they profit off of it. You have wealthy elites who want factories set up in the countries for slave wages labor. You have families like the bush family who come in and scoop up land. etc. etc. etc. There are a million people trying to make this happen and very few trying to have peace. My guess is even if Trump refuses to go in the EU will go in and force his hand. These guys are in for a world of hurt and there is nothing that can be done about it because all the global elite want the place torn apart for some reason or another.

       Great analysis. What does the EU actually have, that they can make decisions for countries like Russia and the US. To me it's just a group of white globalists living out their Pinky &amp; The Brain-esque schemes from their Belgian high castles, oblivious to the realities of the world at large. What does the EU really have that gives them any sort of influence on the world stage? I really don't know the specifics, aside from maybe population.

       So their theory is that if they can get a pipeline going fron SA to EU then it will kill shot russia with a slow dying economy?
      </p>
      <p>
       But if Russia gets a pipe in they will have more power over EU.

       Hardly. I don't even think Russia has a pipeline plan. Right now they are just trying to stop the EU from getting one.

       There's a graphic floating around, I'll have to try and find a link, because I have no idea how legit it actually is. It basically shows two hypothetical paths for a pipeline. A Russian one going through Iran, Iraq, and Syria. And a US one going through SA and Syria. Anyone able to confirm or deny?

       I saw it, while it was a good attempt it was made by a guy who has never done a flow chart before. It is one hell of a mess to walk through. It is basically what I said in a flow chart to help people think. Even if it is a bad flow chart.

       It will force Russia into the globalist banking fold and they are really the only single nation of the world left with the guts and mettle to resist.
      </p>
      <p>
       Completely boxing Russia out of the Middle East has been the design ever since the West began buying oil there.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I don't understand is that if moving the West into renewable energy could subvert all of this and effectively eliminate the need for war in the Middle East, why wouldn't we?
      </p>
      <p>
       Oh right, a bunch of wealthy people wouldn't be if we did that.

       Mostly true... except that Slavs messed each other real good in the Balkans, and Ukraine is having a civil right now (but some argue that both groups are essentially
       <em>
        less
       </em>
       European)... The breakup of the EU might look very much like Balkanization. At the very least, you can rest assured that it will be a financial disaster. Unemployed young men, being dangerous to the existing order, are shipped out in armies. The way you put it, though, makes me I agree that this would be the most surprising development of all (western Euro vs western Euro)... Europe can barely handle any more unemployment... the youth rates in Portugal, Spain, and Italy are already through the charts. If there's a buck in it (and more important, a law that says they
       <em>
        must
       </em>
       ), then it
       <em>
        will
       </em>
       happen, IMO.
