       Typical knee-jerk reaction, before anyone knows anything of hard evidence or implications.  Suspend your judgment for a while if it is as faulty as it appears to be, until evidence and reasoning is applied to the equation.  Nuff said.  Fake-posters welcome to admit your lack of understanding of the facts on the topic by commenting with your mental dump.  Go ahead, get it out, and make room in there for awareness.

       That would explain an emotional reaction to obscure headline-only news.  For what its worth, I'll tell you this is a warning shot and flex to the World not to conduct actions like this and think they will get Obama-era "wah wah" talks at the UN and a complete lack of action / reciprocation.  Trust me, nobody wants war with the US.  But world leadership needs to stop seeing the US as timid and conflict-avoidant tamed by hopeless UN diplomacy.

       I could go on and on about not biting the false flag hook of rebels dropping the gas from the air.  Rebels don't have an airforce.  Hundreds of eye witnesses report it was dropped from the air.  The airstrip that launched the attack was leveled without loss of life.  Russia was warned prior to the attack.  Russia warned Assad, who informed personnel to keep clear of the impending attack area.
      </p>

       Yes, this is part of one side of the discussion.  All I'm saying is that there is ample evidence on both sides to warrant suspending judgement.  We, the public, simply do not know the facts.  So wait for them to come out before setting your hair on fire.

       The leadership is certainly more privy to the facts and intelligence that the public is.  I like to believe that every President (and decision maker everywhere) does what they deem is best (all things considered) with the information they are provided (which is, in the President's case, far more complete that what we see).  Think "the lesser of two evils."  I believe him to be a sound decision maker, but with a media war waged on him, he doesn't explain much, but instead allows the media to dig up their own facts.  The facts have put out just about every fire that the media has started.  All we do now is wait for them to trickle in.

       My goal in posting was not to chastise, but to invite rationale into the discussion and attempt to qualm the tidal wave of knee-jerk reactions during ill-informed situations.  Facts put out fires.  Let's wait for them before passing judgement.  If not, we are no better than imprisonment without a trial..?  ... maybe a poor analogy.

       Not a bad post. But when the dust settles who is going to tell a story based on truth instead of the propaganda they get paid to print. New media is great but you can find any slant taking liberty with the facts on every issue. When Assange and Snowden are not facing prison or death in the US I will listen to the Government. Until then I have to assume they know they are guilty and they do not care what the people think or want.

       THIS!  Much obliged to hear reason here instead of the common over-emotional reaction.  In regard to Assange &amp; Snowden, I'm right there with you but there are political sides to that as well.  Inviting Snowden back in with open arms would set a precedent to the Intelligence community that could be pretty damaging and without a fix.  Best action there is to remain hands-off.  Charge them and not act on extradition or prosecution.

       Why can't  we just have an agenda against trump and his subs and voters because we don't like them?

       Why is it only wrong or propaganda when it goes against trump? But against other political figures and people and subs it's ok? It's really fucking ridiculous the double talk and think happening around the orange oompa loompa and his cult regarding this sub and other forums like it.

       Nothing wrong with that.  If you're cool with hasty generalizations, don't think this post or any of my words are directed at you.  My words are for the moderates of mind and the rationale type.  Just inviting everyone with the time and mental willingness to gather facts and think before suspending judgement.

       You mean the same hasty generalizations that any body on the left has been dealing with here for like a year?  Even if they had facts or sources to support thier arguments? But  now that ts against your views, it's shills and propaganda,  but we just need time to think and gather facts; the same things that weren't being given before?

       This isn't really aimed at you, more the sub in general with how it's been acting with its very obvious bias.

       So much for that "this is a place we can discuss without being banned" bit from a previous comment.  Understood, this is not a place to allow labeling of others in the search for rationale.  I've just never seen a brigade like this before on this sub.

       Fellow Libertarian - don't go too far, Mate!  You will be back when the Fed/IRS get audited.  Strategic attacks and show of force like this avoids greater conflicts and allows diplomacy in the future.  If every World government knows you won't act, they will continue to walk all over you, knowing diplomacy and the UN tames you.  I bet North Korea calms down now.

       So, you're going to come in here and
       <strong>
        tell us that Trump and Tillerson have a right, duty and responsibility to remove and replace President Assad
       </strong>
       (also an eye doctor!) on some faked up half baked claim that he not once but three times gas, bombed and attacked his own people?
      </p>

       When Trump starts lobbing bombs on Israel for the THOUSANDS of lives killed in Gaza by Bibi then you can come in here and shit on us!

       Thats quite a conclusion to jump to.  I don't support regime change; hell, I don't even know the fine details of the entirely complex situation that Syria is.  Not sure anyone could honestly make a claim to...  For the fourth time now, I am just hoping/inviting everyone to suspend judgment until real news and facts come in.  Maybe my message had confrontational wording but it was intended as a response to seeing insane conclusions being jumped to on this sub.
