<p>Now is the time to talk about how we fix this country and this world. Here&#39;s my idea:</p>

<p>Get rid of the Federal Reserve, and create a development bank, like the BRICS countries now have, or the 1st and 2nd Banks of the United States. Then build all of these within the next decade or two:</p>

<p>Without raising taxes at all, the government would have trillions of dollars in free cash flow from selling power, and operating the hyperloop. Completely get rid of carbon emissions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>right now, we go to war by printing money out of thin air, giving it to companies like Raytheon (1.6 mill per tomahawk. we just blasted off somewhere between 50 to 70 of them, no one seems to know how many actually) and taxing the future generation via Inflation. You can&#39;t print bitcoin out of thin air.  They would actually have to collect money from citizens. How much are you willing to pay to &quot;free Syria&quot;  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>According to a Congressional Budget Office (CBO) report published in October 2007, the U.S. wars in Iraq and Afghanistan could cost taxpayers a total of $2.4 trillion by 2017 when counting the huge interest costs because combat is being financed with borrowed money. The CBO estimated that of the $2.4 trillion long-term price tag for the war, about $1.9 trillion of that would be spent on Iraq, or $6,300 per U.S. citizen.[7][8] The most recent CBO report, which was conducted after the end of combat operations and hence did not have to estimate future costs, was released in December 2014 and placed the cost at $0.815 trillion.[9]</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wouldn&#39;t it be interesting if bitcoin itself created a development bank? Like they would maintain the current trickle of bitcoins for the mining operators, but they would also start creating 0% interest bitcoin loans to certain businesses that were truly helping the world.</p>

<p>They could easily lend millions of dollars without affecting their product (which is already in a deflationary spiral upward in value).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Bitcoins are created and given to the miners who find blocks(secure the network and prevent double spends)  The awarded bitcoins are called Blockrewards. Blockrewards halfs every 2016 blocks. Each block gets generated roughly every 10 minutes and that comes to ~4 years. The first 4 years blockrewards were 50 per solved block. Then it was 25. Now it&#39;s at 12.5 and so on.. until one day there will be no new bitcoins generated capped at 21 mil.  at the moment, with the block size, you can have up to 7 transactions per seconds. In the future, ( next few years) that number will go up to thousands and even hundreds of thousands per seconds</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The limit is that the generation of the blocks is at a fixed rate (it changes the rate in periods of 4 years, but the rate cant be manipulated).  If we experience substantial growth however, we wouldn&#39;t be able to increase our currency supply because the system is limited and it would create drag</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Each bitocin is divisible to 100  million pieces. You can have .00000001 bitcoin.   21000000 x 100000000 = 2100000000000000</p>

<p>thats a lot of units. You mustn&#39;t worry darling. even if thats not enough, you can divide it even further. </p>

<p>Lets say you need to increase the money supply. What we do right now, is print money out of think air, and lend it to government which interns lends it to banks which then lend to you. </p>

<p>Option B. 
you can say.. &quot;ok everyone... now instead of you being able to divide your bitcoin to 100 million pieces, now you can divide it up into a 10 billion pieces!  BAM. You just created more units. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Its exactly the same as changing the value of the units of money, instead of changing the value of the goods.</p>

<p>As time goes forward, there will be loss.  People will lose jump drives and shit and therefore bitcoins will be destroyed and you will not be able to replace them - this will artificially be increasing the value because the total availability of the currency is diminishing, all while the economy and population is growing.</p>

<p>If this were cash, and for some reason we couldn&#39;t print it, then our other option would be to increase a dollar&#39;s worth to $10 and chop pennies up so you can pay in fractions.  I think it makes more sense to hold the units value as static, and then let a market decide how much a gallon of milk is worth.</p>

<p>Plus, kind of sucks that you need computers/internet to deal with bitcoin - its a cryptocurrency.  You can&#39;t just hand somebody a bitcoin after they mow your lawn for you - you will need some sort of electronic to store it on.  Doesn&#39;t seem like a stable system to me. Not sure what other downsides there are to re-valuing the currencies sub-units, I&#39;m not an economist - but thats very odd.</p>
