       They already have open source society form their prospective so we need open source government so we can watch them.
      </p>
      <p>
       National Security You Say? Oh well, if they don't have anything to hide, then there should be no problems.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its fine if we don't have every single bit of info on war strategies against ISIS on the ground level but war has to end! War is the most childish way of resolving societal issues. Its like 2 fucking babies slapping each other over a piece of candy instead of splitting it in half.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump is showing way too much support to Israel to be trusted at this point. His whole cabinet consists of bankers who are the ultimate abusers of society.
      </p>
      <p>
       Forget the law. The real law is inside of our minds. We all carry a basic right and wrong discernment ability. Laws are abused and manipulated in circus like courts. They can trick you into doing any evil by justifying it on some existing law that they wrote. They just use existing laws to cover their tracks. I thought laws were supposed to protect us. Instead, they are being used as weapons against mankind.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ex CIA whistleblower Robert Steele is right. We need open source government including open source CIA which he says will cost 2 billion dollars to establish but the usefulness to society will be priceless.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump just exposed his hand (unless the CIA used manipulation drugs on him to turn society against him which is always a possibility). The problem is we can't tell because these assholes work under the table against us.
      </p>
      <p>
       No matter what we do, we will never be safe unless we have total transparency into our government in an easy to digest daily briefing to the people.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the meantime, the whole planet needs to swarm these politicians from every walk of life and call them out for their shit. I don't know about you, but I will humiliate the shit out of a politician if I see them around media who can record the whole thing just like we did with Bill Clinton. If politicians aren't being cussed out anytime they step into public, we are failing. Ya, Ron Paul and some good ones get a pass but most all of them need to be verbally torn apart live on television. We need to drive these bastards crazy so they can't even stand being politicians anymore. We need to make their jobs unbearable.
      </p>
      <p>
       These people are afraid of us. Its true. They know we are the 99% and can easily topple them if we were coordinated. That is why they make sure we are weak by dividing us and ruining our economic conditions while trying to destroy our family units which would totally ruin us btw. Their biggest fear is if all these family units were to unite into one large family system because we would be very powerful. Transparency probably makes them afraid also but we need it or else they will constantly get away with injustices against the people solely for more power and wealth even though they don't need the money.
      </p>
      <p>
       This has become a full blown circus. The elite are playing with fire. This Assad base bombing is going to outrage the planet. I know many people think the only way to stop them is 1776ing them but I assure you, if we just use a little bit of creativity, we can crush the cabal beneath our feet entirely using peaceful methods. Its just a new experience so many are confused on what this means. It means redpilling, uniting, forcing transparency, humiliating politicians in public, and anything else we can think of. There are thousands of options. Think outside the box.
      </p>
      <p>
       Netenyahu, Rothschild, Soros, James Comey, Obama, Hillary, McCain, Schumer, Pilosi, and all these corrupt scumbags should not be ruling us. Its time to drain the swamp with our own bare hands.
      </p>
      <p>
       We simply have no choice at this point.
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT: If everyone here wants to shut down bankers once and for all, we have to get OFF our dependence on MONEY. The only system that would work and be humane at the same time is Sacred Economics found here:

       This would immediately restructure the country where every person is part of the whole instead of having a few people abusing the society using money as a slave whip.

       I read your response and I would like to say, that before anything, we need to establish this beliefs:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        Money is a broken system and it ruins everything. Instead of people doing business to serve the community, they are doing it for money instead. This is the major problem. A replacement system that doesn't use money is called Sacred Economics found here:

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Money is just a weak way of bringing people to work. It had its uses but the usefulness has run its course.
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         We need to be willing to make the world better. Without will, nothing will happen.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         People need to understand that although the suffering they are experiencing now is still bearable, it will only increase in intensity UNTIL we decide to fix this world. At that point, the suffering will diminish overtime instead. Its easy to brush everything off but by doing so, we will simply postpone saving the world when the suffering is beyond bearable which is already the case for many Americans and most everyone world wide. The whole world is dissatisfied and people who don't participate are essentially digging their own graves by not doing so.

       Fair enough. I simply didn't see it among all of the ass kissing and bullshit questions about secret gadgets. I expected much more from a community that supposedly questions everything--most notably, powerful people in government. So, I went at him head on.
      </p>
      <p>
       The point was, he got extremely angry in what I asked of him--which wasn't really insulting whatsoever. He should have expected as much. In any case, while I agree with a lot of his points, I am hard pressed to admire his intentions.

       I couldn't read everything you wrote cause I'm at work but you are over the top and way too eccentric and analytical. And I fucking love it. Great talking points.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can not remove corruption EVER without an open source government. Here is a way to simplify everything. Make congress bigger. Possibly double in size and make sure they have skills in different areas (healthcare, finance, education, foreign policy etc.) Then essentially remove all power from other government groups and give it ALL to Congress...here is the fun part:
      </p>
      <p>
       Being a member of Congress will be considered an honor and sacrifice because you will have multiple cameras and microphones recording you 24/7 for the time that you are in office. Say each member has a 2 year limit..if they get away from those cameras at any point they are replaced. We the people should be able to log online and watch them during normal business hours. (The other times like in the middle of the night will be recorded but maybe not be available live on demand.) We can make term limits 1 year if people dont want to be on camera every second of the day for 2 years.
      </p>
      <p>
       That plan sounds bat shit crazy right? It's because the thought of actually getting corruption out of politics is bat shit crazy. Unless you do sometjing such as record the people in power 24/7. There would be no black mailing, no back door deal making, no fucking eachother over and no secrets from the American people. I get that there will need to be some military opperations kept secret which I'm sure there is some system to come up with similar to congress. For starters, no all out war with another country without congress approving so that greatly reduces the militaries power right there.

       None of what I said would ever happen though. It is too simple and makes too much sense. I don't know if I'd be qualified but your average joe such as myself would be able to apply to run for congress. If you want to make that sacrifice of giving up your privacy. If you don't then fuck off. The military gives up 6+ months of privacy when they go on tours during war. Congress should be viewed as the same type of sacrifice.

       The way forward is attacking the banking cartel that funds all of this. Find a way to remove or replace them (I prefer replacement with a national bank) and you kill the head.
