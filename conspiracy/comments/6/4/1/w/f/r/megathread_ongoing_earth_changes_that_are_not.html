<p>It is an equidistant azimuthal projection. Which is a highly accurate map and one that I believe an accurate geometrical map.  One of Mercators early maps supposedly copied from older geometric maps is beautiful and extremely accurate.. it makes the earth look hollow? - <a href="https://www.wdl.org/en/item/6766/view/1/1/">https://www.wdl.org/en/item/6766/view/1/1/</a>.

<p>Will Trump challenge United States, Incorporated?</p>

<p>I will continue to post until I feel there is a change of &quot;pace,&quot; and everything slows down... but I don&#39;t feel like that&#39;s going to happen anytime soon. I don&#39;t feel that I am the only one who has suddenly become &quot;awake,&quot; at something not being quite right at the moment in the world, whether it being a local change I can see or a global change as detailed below.</p>

<p>Please check my older threads for information from end of November 2016 onward.. I have run out of characters because there is just so much shit going on.</p>

<p>Apologies if you have read most of this already.. but just check on the recent updates at the bottom to see that whatever is going on is a global phenomenon and not something to turn your nose up at... and it&#39;s not stopping.</p>

<p>First.. read this - <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170113094903/https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2016/10/13/executive-order-coordinating-efforts-prepare-nation-space-weather-events">https://web.archive.org/web/20170113094903/https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2016/10/13/executive-order-coordinating-efforts-prepare-nation-space-weather-events</a></p>

<p>Regardless what you think, this Order is worded very seriously and encompasses a huge amount of resources in only a short release. It was released rather quickly and;</p>

<p>&quot;But the order bypassed the North American Electric Reliability Corp. (NERC), the interstate grid security monitor, which has been developing solar storm protections for the grid since 2012.</p>

<p>&quot;It was a surprise to us,&quot; said Gerry Cauley, NERC president and CEO.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxaM7BWb4Lw">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxaM7BWb4Lw</a></p>

<p>What is the Schumann Resonance? Why is it increasing?</p>

<p><a href="http://www.drjoedispenza.com/blog/consciousness/what-does-the-spike-in-the-schumann-resonance-mean/">http://www.drjoedispenza.com/blog/consciousness/what-does-the-spike-in-the-schumann-resonance-mean/</a></p>

<p>&quot;On January 31, 2017, for the first time in recorded history, the Schumann resonance reached frequencies of 36+ Hz. It was considered an anomaly when in 2014 this frequency rose from its usual 7.83 Hz to somewhere in the 15-25 Hz levels—so a jump from 7.83 Hz to 36+ Hz is a big deal. That’s more than a five-fold increase in resonant frequency levels. What does this mean to us as inhabitants of Mother Earth? According to neuroscience, frequency recordings of 36+ Hz in the human brain are more associated with a stressed nervous system than a relaxed and healthy one.&quot;</p>

<p>Information on the &quot;Earth Wobble,&quot;.. or pole shift etc. Whatever you want to call it.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.wizaurad.com/axis-drift.html">http://www.wizaurad.com/axis-drift.html</a></p>

<p>We are wobbling on our axis, which will obviously have consequences on the earth.. if you notice in that plot diagram that the latter half of 2016 looks much more.. extreme. The Earth Wobbling is natural my only correlation in this is that where the graph gets more extreme is where I feel the world has started to respond at a similar pace.</p>

<p>Why is this happening? I don&#39;t know. So many different things at once, so many theories and facts to digest and dispute.. so much fake information, shit sources!</p>

<p>For Earth Changes (weather,seismic,volcanic) I started posting around November.. because November is when I started to become &quot;awake,&quot; that there is something not quite right with our planet at the moment and it is behaving abnormally.</p>

<p>Why do I say this? Most articles state that scientists are &quot;perplexed,&quot; or &quot;puzzled,&quot; at things that are happening.</p>

<p>FYI - All information is from watchers.news, an invaluable resource which is unopinionated and deals in facts. They reference various local institutions.. obviously depending on what the earth change is.</p>

<p>(I have cut content from older posts, please see those for additional information)</p>

<p>OKAY...</p>

<p>STILL WITH ME?</p>

<p>Going to pre-face December with some quick facts about Earthquakes.. because most of you will be saying &quot;volcanoes and earthquakes happen all the time.&quot; and you&#39;d be RIGHT! they do..</p>

<p>but; There have been 257 earthquakes over magnitude 5 and many more very close to this number. Just to put this into perspective on average there is an estimated 3.6 earthquakes of a magnitude of 5-5.9 a day, in the last 9 days there have been an average of 24.8 nearly 7 times what is usual. It is estimated there is a 6-6.9 magnitude earthquake every 3 days, we have had 2.6 a day for the last 9 days. Lastly for the big earthquakes of magnitude 7-7.9 you usually get 1 every 25 days (estimate) there have been an average of 1 a day for the last 9 days. (Stats from End of Dec.)</p>

<p><a href="http://www.anonews.co/257-earthquakes-9days/">http://www.anonews.co/257-earthquakes-9days/</a></p>

<p>This is also referencing a cosmic energy wave, which is also being attributed (mostly on youtube unfortunately.. but nothing [mainstream] is talking about this) a helium gas cloud which we have entered bringing in higher H3,H4 into our atmosphere.
does anybody know what a brown dwarf star is made of????? (HELIUM)</p>

<p>&quot;The earth reels like a drunkard, it sways like a hut in the wind; so heavy upon it is the guilt of its rebellion that it falls--never to rise again.&quot; - Isaiah 24:20</p>

<p>I think it&#39;s safe to say that historically no one tied this verse to pole shifts, but I think it&#39;s worth consideration.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am personally a Christian I can give my two cents on this subject and make out points. </p>

<p>Firstly whatever happens first and foremost will be worse than what a human can actually imagine or think up of. Even if you though of the worse case scenario of such of a event it will be worse. </p>

<p>Secondly Bible does mention man will be scorched by great heat during the end times. Which based off certain events that are happen now with Trump and his clear purposes which is actually mention in Isaiah 45. I will say this. </p>

<p>Mostly likely the shift will happen mid 2018. Based off other pastors who personally prophesied Trump winning back since 2007. Also mentioned of a large scale terrorist attack on the US during the start of 2018 and the anti-christ will show up after the world goes bottom up between the shift and the terrorist attack. In an attempt to fool the world onto following him to their graves. Which overall means whoever is elected during 2017 elections across the world even here in the US is the last world leaders of the world if we take all current and soon to be events into consideration. This is just my info to you guys from a Christian standpoint. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry about that, but had to be honest about it that&#39;s just who I am, but I will say this. Regardless of with each person believes even though I personally chose to believe in Jesus and some may not. Your choices impact where you end up and that is made very clear in the Bible. </p>

<p>Even though it is troubling and sad. The Bible says worry not for such things must happen to fulfill the word of God, but all things will turn alright in the end because Jesus will return to set the world right. Humanity will live in a new world of righteousness and prosperity for a eternity where there will be no death or sickness.</p>

<p>Life is a journey and even if the end if close can&#39;t say it is all to bad. This is why I personally chose to be a Christian and I have read and listen to the view points of many, but the thing that intrigues me the most about Christianity it is about one thing and that is choice, not force.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Earth&#39;s magnetic poles are moving, and appear to be shifting.  This probably isn&#39;t a big deal.  Our magnetosphere is breaking down, which is a big deal - but it&#39;s hard to tell if it will go back to normal when the poles are done moving, or even what normal should be.

    <div class="md"><p>I was going to post this actually. Not to be too crazy but seriously after trump got elected I noticed drastic immediate differences in what seems to be pollution. The sunsets are way different and they grow more and more different. Pink skies became common. Just the last two years sunsets changed but now it&#39;s much much more quickly changing. To the point that I feel like everyone else is idiots to not notice. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve been photographing this stuff constantly as well. The last two days there has been yellow clouds and weird mistiness and the sunsets got even weirder. It feels fake and mystical almost. I even wondered if somehow trump could pull off chemical mind control but I doubt this lol. Maybe something to confuse people tho. I don&#39;t really think this is the case tho. I think more people are driving and I think there is much less regulation of emissions or something. Or corruption. </p>

<p>Here is some photos I&#39;ve taken since:</p>

I know I saved a link to at bare minimum link to the youtube vid or the FAA cam(which was shown in the vid how to go to the faa cam and see it yourself, vid was 18 mins, and the uploader only had a few uploads i think he got the vid from another source it wasnt his discovery originally) on my laptop, even if you somehow never got my message(i thought it mightve been a reply to one of your earlier ongoing earth change threads which is when i was researching this stuff and saw your post a month ago) but ive logged into both of my reddit accounts and now theres nothing just a gap. says i have nothing between last week and 2 months ago. I dunno man, im tryin to find it on youtube again but it only had like 200 views and theres SO many bullshit videos.  i shouldnt have mentioned anything until i made sure i had the link. i showed it to my wife she was freaked out by it, wasnt a lense flare. </p>

<p>Even weirder is I felt like I remember these skies as a kid. That made me wonder if society could be controlled on every level. Media is all fake. Culture fake. Or maybe using terpenes and aromatic compounds that don&#39;t have noticeable smells but still highly psychoactive and spraying us with them to create different moods. </p>

<p>I thought the last bit because of recent aggression in everyone. It seems fishy. I don&#39;t remember society being this stupid lol. </p>

<p>Then what if everyone&#39;s memory is wiped like every ten years and then they are fed lies somehow. And they openly accept it. But then schizophrenics maybe are immune and thus why they come up with conspiracy theories. Then maybe psychedelics and weed both reverse this memory issue. Lol. </p>

<p>Now I really don&#39;t believe any of this. It&#39;s just open minded pondering. I&#39;m also not uneducated. I&#39;ve obsessively researched sciences like physics, biology, health, neuroscience(my actual passion), computer technology, hacking lol, arts, I&#39;m also musician.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What scares me is that each week you can see progress of the changes it seems. I am nervous. But there is also more variation in the pollution levels seemingly. But I&#39;m also wondering what if they had terraforming technologies? Then maybe pollution stops mattering and they can go even worse about it. Cuz they can just reverse it. Or maybe people are being suicidal and the world is ending! Lol. </p>

<p>There was this very strange dust storm alert on the first day that I started noticing weird things more and more. It was rapid cloud formation and movement tho. I didn&#39;t see any dust. Then I wondered if it was a test to spread chemicals or maybe weather modulation. Then after this there has been a more hazy sky sorta with constant light clouds. Misty overcast kinda. Makes the sun not even look the same. Diffuses the sun into a massive looking ball. And sunsets have stripes now. I remember maybe seeing stuff like this as a kid. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>&quot;On January 31, 2017, for the first time in recorded history, the Schumann resonance reached frequencies of 36+ Hz. It was considered an anomaly when in 2014 this frequency rose from its usual 7.83 Hz to somewhere in the 15-25 Hz levels—so a jump from 7.83 Hz to 36+ Hz is a big deal. That’s more than a five-fold increase in resonant frequency levels. What does this mean to us as inhabitants of Mother Earth? According to neuroscience, frequency recordings of 36+ Hz in the human brain are more associated with a stressed nervous system than a relaxed and healthy one.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nobody is trying to tell you what to do, as it&#39;s criticism to the issue, not an ad hominem. One of the issues with flat earth, unlike most conspiracy theories, is that the resolution or confirmation of the mystery is considerably easier, non movable and stable. From low orbit balloons with cameras, to organizing trips while publicly showing your beliefs and intentions (in case something happens according to the theory, because I seen the flat earth society is a thing), to nanosat access through universities and so forth. Yet seems like this conspiracy is intended to be passive and never acting, even if the potential resolution is very objective and material. That&#39;s my opinion and that&#39;s what I meant.</p>

<p>I think criticism and being critic about our own beliefs isn&#39;t a bad thing, as you said questioning might lead you to more satisfactory answers, and I didn&#39;t mean to lecture you as it was more intended to discuss the issue of what is going on, and I know you are aware of it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Honeycomb/pocket earth. It&#39;s a theory like hollow earth, but accounts for the possibility that maybe it&#39;s not a perfect hollow sphere with one civilisation on the outside and one inside, but rather many pockets of hollowed out area possibly as large as continents, interconnected by cave systems (think Agartha). The thing about hollow earth that doesn&#39;t personally sit well with me is that the &quot;mainstream&quot; hollow earth theory suggests an &quot;inner sun&quot;, which I&#39;m not too versed on the science to say if that&#39;s possible. But pocket/honeycomb earth leaves for bioluminescence, or any kind of photoluminescence including the possibility for a kind of inner sun if that is possible. It&#39;s a bit more open ended, which I think it&#39;s more sensible since in reality we know pretty much nothing about what&#39;s down there. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dude. I&#39;m reading a book called &quot;The Sixth Extinction&quot; which describes many of these animal deaths and more. The author&#39;s claim is that the earth has gone through five major extinctions in its history (one being responsible for the dinosaurs&#39; deaths) and we will soon experience another mass extinction. </p>

<p>I only just started reading so I can&#39;t attest to the book&#39;s merit but it&#39;s fascinating so far.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>be wary of confirmation bias. </p>

<p>The mass animal deaths can be attributed to pollution and the ubiquity of the Internet and the 24 hour news cycle leading to us being able to read about reports we would otherwise never hear about. </p>

<p>this applies to earth quakes as well, monitoring has improved immensely and is easier for the information to be spread. </p>

<p>Statistics can be misleading, for example the number of head injuries went up after the introduction of heavier helmets in war, but that was the result of how previously any head injury was only recorded if the person survived, but if not they were only counted as dead. </p>

<p>Internet ubiquity leads to things being reported globally that would have otherwise never left their home country. </p>
