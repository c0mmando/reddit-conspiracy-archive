        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The Western corporate media has largely closed ranks on the false narrative that Assad&#39;s regime was responsible for the April 4th, 2017 chemical weapons attack in Idlib, Syria. But Maria Zakharova, Director of the Information and Press Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation, in an informative <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=419lQljnS-0">press briefing on Youtube, where she thoroughly handles a prodding CBS reporter,</a> points out that there is an expert agency tasked with investigating such claims, the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), and she invited the Western war mongers to allow them to investigate. (Note, you will find lots more gems like that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCeix8jbmQnS6FprsJIsjVyQ">on Inessa S&#39;s Youtube channel</a>, where anyone who is curious can see that the demonization of Russia is based largely on an invented narrative of a war-like, evil Russia. But if you listen to their leaders and diplomats they are more sane and intelligent than Western leaders, especially on foreign policy matters.)</p>

<p>If you look up the OPCW organization&#39;s website as of today, April 10th, they still have not concluded their investigation according to a release dated April 7th: </p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.opcw.org/news/article/media-brief-reported-use-of-chemical-weapons-southern-idlib-syria-4-april-2017/">UPDATED Media Brief: Reported Use of Chemical Weapons, Southern Idlib, Syria, 4 April 2017</a></p>

<p>The Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) is a treaty-based international organisation that operates according to a strict confidentiality regime, which governs the operations of the Organisation, protects the integrity of its investigations, ensures the security of its technical experts, and determines what information can be made public.</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>The OPCW is investigating the incident in southern Idlib under the on-going mandate of the Fact-Finding Mission (FFM), which is “to establish facts surrounding allegations of the use of toxic chemicals, reportedly chlorine, for hostile purposes in the Syrian Arab Republic”. The OPCW cannot and will not release information about an on-going investigation. This policy exists to preserve the integrity of the investigatory process and its results as well as to ensure the safety and security of OPCW experts and personnel involved. All parties are asked to respect the confidentiality parameters required for a rigorous and unimpeded investigation. </p>

<p>...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But the Trump administration and Western media closed ranks on the narrative that Assad did it and American destroyers launched cruise missle strikes which hit the Shayrat Airfield in Homs on the 6th.</p>

<p>Indeed this is nothing new, in 2013 the &quot;American deep state&quot; tried the same stunt of using a chemical attack as a pretext to strike the Syrian Armed Forces. They used a chemical weapons attack by &quot;their moderate&quot; Islamic terrorist allies as a potential fait accompli for an attack on Syria, but the dovish Obama desisted. In 2017 the hawkish Trump didn&#39;t. </p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.dw.com/en/is-assad-to-blame-for-the-chemical-weapons-attack-in-syria/a-38330217">Deutsche Welle: Is Assad to blame for the chemical weapons attack in Syria?</a></p>

<p>...</p>

<p>In 2014, investigative journalist Seymour Hersh reported on opposition forces&#39; ability to use chemical weapons. In an article for the &quot;London Review of Books,&quot; Hersh obtained documents from the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), the Pentagon&#39;s own spy organization. They suggested that the Nusra Front, a Syrian offshoot of al Qaeda, had access to the sarin nerve agent. A chemical weapons attack on the Damascus suburb of Ghouta in August 2013, which was blamed on Assad, was carried out by rebels, according to Hersh&#39;s article. They wanted Washington to presume Assad had crossed Obama&#39;s &quot;red line&quot; and draw the US into a war.</p>

<p>The Ghouta attack</p>

<p>Obama&#39;s Director of National Intelligence at the time, James Clapper, was able to dissuade Obama from ordering a cruise missile strike, according to a newly-published book by Mideast expert Michael Lüders. Presumably, a deciding factor was an analysis of the chemical weapons used in Ghouta, conducted by a British military lab, which found the gas to be of a different composition than the Syrian army possessed.</p>

<p>The attack took place while UN weapons inspectors were in the country, on Assad&#39;s invitation, said Meyer. Assad had asked them to investigate a chemical weapons attack from March 2013 outside Aleppo, which killed Syrian soldiers.</p>

<p>&quot;It makes no sense that the regime would carry out an attack with inspectors in the country,&quot; he said.
SYMBOLBILD USA verstärken Marine-Präsenz vor syrischer Küste (picture-alliance/dpa)</p>

<p>Former weapons inspector Richard Lloyd and MIT professor Theodore Postol cast further doubt on Assad&#39;s role in the Ghouta attack. They reported in 2014 that the chemical weapons could have only been fired from rebel-held territory, with a range of up to 2.5 kilometers (1.6 miles).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Indeed, most of the Assad &quot;already did it&quot; before the incident was investigated, evidence hinges on the Western created White Helmets: </p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.alternet.org/grayzone-project/how-white-helmets-became-international-heroes-while-pushing-us-military">Alternet: How the White Helmets Became International Heroes While Pushing U.S. Military Intervention and Regime Change in Syria</a></p>

<p>...</p>

<p>Yet the group is anything but impartial. The White Helmets’ leadership is driven by a pro-interventionist agenda conceived by the Western governments and public relations groups that back them. Anyone who visits the group’s website—which is operated by an opposition-funded PR company known as the Syria Campaign—will be immediately directed to a request to sign a petition for a no-fly zone to “stop the bombs” in Syria. These sorts of communiques highlight the dual role the White Helmets play as a civil defense organization saving lives while lobbying for a U.S. military campaign that will almost inevitably result in the collapse of Syria’s government.</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>The White Helmets were founded in collaboration with USAID’s Office of Transitional Initiatives—the wing that has promoted regime change around the world—and have been provided with $23 million in funding from the department. USAID supplies the White Helmets through Chemonics, a for-profit contractor based in Washington DC that has become notorious for wasteful aid imbroglios from Haiti to Afghanistan. While members of the White Helmets have been implicated in atrocities carried out by jihadist rebel groups, the names of many of the firms that supposedly monitor and evaluate their work have been kept secret by USAID on unspecified security grounds.</p>

<p>Funny that you appreciate the writeup because I just tried posting it the shithole Imzy.com alternative to Reddit and these are the low quality edgy responses I got from idiots who didn&#39;t even read it before it was removed:<br/>
<a href="https://www.imzy.com/debunker/post/was_assad_behind_april_4_2017_chemical_weapons_att">https://www.imzy.com/debunker/post/was_assad_behind_april_4_2017_chemical_weapons_att</a></p>

<p>Then the nerds and entertainment industry marks who &quot;lead&quot; that community removed the post from /debunker for being a &quot;conspiracy theory&quot; and when I rebuked them they banned me. They also removed it from imzy&#39;s /news because the OPCW, Deutsche Welle, the Director of the Information and Press Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation and Alternet are &quot;not credible sources&quot;. All on a medium with less 70,000 users that wants to be a Reddit alternative... It seems they wouldn&#39;t know good content if it smacked them in the ass. Too many people only trust the largest pressitutes of the biggest corporations within the mainstream media. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>PBS Frontline did an excellent documentary on this called <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/film/inside-assads-syria/">Inside Assad&#39;s Syria</a>, that you won&#39;t hear from media with far more reach. That documentary showed that while the secular opposition and other people still didn&#39;t like Assad they were against opposing him, because it would lead to Islamic terrorists or &quot;moderate terrorists&quot; to destroy the state like in Iraq, Libya, etc.: </p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/film/inside-assads-syria/transcript/">http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/film/inside-assads-syria/transcript/</a><br/>
MARTIN SMITH:<br/>
Their situation is tricky. They oppose Assad’s dictatorship, but they know that the regime also uses them as a kind of token opposition that gives Assad cover.</p>

<p>[on camera] The opposition that resides outside the country calls you the “pseudo opposition.” How do you respond to that?</p>

<p>2nd ACTIVIST:<br/>
[subtitles] We are the ones who lived without fuel and electricity and under sanctions. We are the ones who suffered, and we are the true ones. Here we are demanding a change of government to achieve a democratic secular state from the inside.</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>ANAS JOUDEH:
Sure. This is— this is the path. This is the way at the end. There is no alternative. We have no alternative rather than to talk with each other.</p>

<p>MARTIN SMITH:<br/>
[voice-over] In 2011, Joudeh joined the protests calling for the downfall of Assad. But after four-and-a-half years of a destabilizing war, he now cautions that rapid change could be dangerous.</p>

<p>ANAS JOUDEH:<br/>
It’s not that because we love the regime. It’s because we don’t want the collapse of the state. People are coming here in the areas controlled by the state or by the regime because they want the institutions of the state, because they need security, the minimum of security, the minimum of stability.</p>

<p>And we know— we have witnessed what happened in Iraq and what happened in Libya and what happened in many countries where this law’s main institution will collapse.</p>
