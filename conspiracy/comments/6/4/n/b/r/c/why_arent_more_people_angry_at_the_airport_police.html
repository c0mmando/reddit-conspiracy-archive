So while United botched the overbooking and paying people to deboard process, and called police far too quickly, the police themselves overreacted very dangerously and violently. </p>

<p>I think we should be asking questions about the airport police, not just United. I almost feel like talking about United too much is a convenient scapegoat for not talking about the police and what this says about the police state. </p>

<p>&quot;If we all stop flying United, problem solved! Right guys? Fuck United!&quot; - the main subs right now</p>

<p>If security of anyone tells you to leave you have to leave. if you&#39;re pissed u sue them because it&#39;s a civil matter. by going all rambo on the security and refusing to move he was trespassing. he can sue in court and be reimbursed for time etc.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nobody cares about that. They care that the flight wasn&#39;t overbooked, the guy had already been boarded and was in his seat when he was told he was randomly selected to be booted off the plane for 4 United Employees who needed to be at another airport 20 hours later (which they could have driven to in about 5 hours), that the airline employees called in the air police who illegally tried to remove him from the plane. Not only that but they did it with force based on a false claim from the airline staff that this guy was a threat. You seem like you might not be multi informed about this subject so I would suggest doing some more research. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/64pfak/aviation_attorney_questions_united_passengers/">Here</a> might be a good place to start if you don&#39;t want to read through United&#39;s <a href="https://www.united.com/web/en-US/content/contract.aspx">Contract of Carriage</a>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If it&#39;s a non-story, then all the links everywhere are just clickbait whose purpose, which we all know, is only there for initial knee jerk reactions and actually has very little substance behind it. &quot;I see it so I must know all about it&quot; is essentially the same as &quot;Well, I saw it on TV so it must be true&quot;. Research, on the other hand, requires effort and further digging to see if the clickbait is what it says it is and generally can&#39;t be confirmed using only 1 source or a handful of shitty sources.   </p>

<p>It is more than just &quot;oh my god this guy got dragged off a flight&quot; or &quot;who cares about this&quot;. Your apathy toward others will not be fixed by doing research. People care because they choose to and plenty of people care that our rights are being taken from us little by little, day by day. That&#39;s the entire plan, do something outrageous, see what the backlash is, and if/when it finally blows over and the dust settles, let&#39;s see where we stand. If it wasn&#39;t too bad, we&#39;ll do it again. And again. And again, until it&#39;s worse than before when you had the chance to still care and do something about it.  </p>

<p>If you don&#39;t care about this, why comment at all? Just to be part of something? To make others feel the same way as you? Because your eyes are being inconvenienced by seeing all the hoopla? Dude, come on. </p>

<p>Plus, why the hell did everyone along the chain let more people board the plane, someone should have put the last people boarding on hold or something. Denying a flight( and compensating) is far easier before luggage check and wait times then in the plane when it&#39;s already late for takeoff. </p>

<p>Everyone agreed they were not paid enough for this and the flight crew got stuck with this mess. Then the police goons took it to an other level.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Apparently there was an extra crew of 4 united workers that they were adding to the flight kind of last-minute, which is why the deboarding conversation happened on the plane instead of at the gate, where it should&#39;ve happened. So that was United&#39;s fault as well, for not planning better to relocate their crews</p>

<p>If United had used their own security personnel to bash that doctor&#39;s face against a seat, they&#39;d be in some potential hot water. Instead the police did it, and because police are immune from consequences, so too is United, apart from the likely civil suit.</p>

<p><strong>Isn&#39;t it convenient that the police are on hand to provide this service to a private company?</strong></p>

<p>In return people are raking United over the coals, while the typically brutal police involved once again avoid discussion. But it could have been any airline and nobody would be surprised. We&#39;re deep in a police state and the culture at airports is one of its most revolting manifestations. </p>

Creating an incident that brings them into the picture where we already know they have zero tolerance for anyone accused of making trouble on an airplane is definitely going to produce some seriously aggressive action that they never bother to ask any questions about doing because the airlines give the order and they&#39;re simply supposed to carry it out without question or delay. So in all such instances it&#39;s the Airline&#39;s responsibility when they call those cops in. The cops have no idea what kind of trouble anyone has caused or might cause their job is simply have to get them off the plane as fast as possible any way they can.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll take a devil&#39;s advocate position here. (I might be getting some of these details wrong).</p>

<p>When you purchase an airline ticket, you are making a contract with the airline. They agree to transport you buy airplane in exchange for money, but they reserve the right to break the contract for a number of reasons, including reasons outside your control. When they break the contract, they owe a penalty. I&#39;ve seen 200% of the ticket price up to some limit tossed around. </p>

<p>You don&#39;t have a &quot;right&quot; in any sense of the word to fly on a plane you&#39;ve purchased a ticket for. You have a contractual agreement. In this case, the airline decided to break the agreement, which is their prerogative. It may not be a good move PR-wise or a good business practice, but they&#39;re within their rights (this time it is a right) to break the contract and suffer the stipulated penalties. </p>

<p>Now, once the contract was broken, you have no right to be on the plane. In the eyes of the law, you&#39;re trespassing. Your license to remain on the plane has been revoked by the owner. In all systems with private property rights (i.e. pretty much everything except full on socialism or contrarily anarchism), we grant the police the power to enforce private property laws. </p>

<p>As such, the police are entitled to use any legal means to remove you from the plane, including physical force if you do not comply with their lawful orders to peaceably vacate the premises. From what I saw, the man refused to comply, which justified the police in using force. </p>

<p>If you want to argue that we should be angry with the police, to be consistent, I think you would have to conclude that police are never justified in using physical force to remove a person who is trespassing on private property. How long should the police have waited before using physical force? Can police ever use force to remove a trespasser?</p>

<p>If United had used their own security personnel to bash that doctor&#39;s face against a seat, they&#39;d be in some potential hot water. Instead the police did it, and because police are immune from consequences, so too is United, apart from the likely civil suit.</p>

<p><strong>Isn&#39;t it convenient that the police are on hand to provide this service to a private company?</strong></p>

<p>In return people are raking United over the coals, while the typically brutal police involved once again avoid discussion. But it could have been any airline and nobody would be surprised. We&#39;re deep in a police state and the culture at airports is one of its most revolting manifestations. </p>
