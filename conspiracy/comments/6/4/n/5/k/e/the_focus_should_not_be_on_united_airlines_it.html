       The narrative is quickly, swiftly projecting that your anger should be on United, and the front page is littered with all kinds of random complaints about them- from jokes like "Delta sure is thankful today" to posts about United killing dogs or something.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regardless, everyone seems to be missing that the anger should be directed AT THE POLICE.  No one seems to be talking about the fact that they beat the shit out of someone who was just sitting there- until he was bloody- and dragged him out in front of everyone- for no other reason than "they said so."  THIS COULD HAPPEN TO YOU. 
 It doesn't matter which airline you're on, or even if you are flying- you could be walking down the street.  The point is, and let's not lose sight of this- that the posts are removed and the story is censored because they don't want people feeling rightfully appalled at the police and their blatant disregard for any rights or decency.

       This couldn't happen to me. I know how airlines work and sitting on a plane at the terminal is not the place to pick a fight with anyone. I'd comply and take my voucher from United plus the flight United arranged for me to be on with another airline later that day. I might post on reddit about how dumb the whole thing was.

       Again, the guy wasn't "picking a fight."  And I would argue that the behavior of the cops is less acceptable than simply sitting there and not moving.  If you think otherwise, you're pretty brainwashed.

       It's a airplane bro. If anyone with authority says you've got to go, you've got to go. This is an ask once and then fuck you the fuck up situation from the authority perspective. From the passenger perspective it's can't win. No one is going anywhere until the flight crew says so and they're allowed to kick you off for looking at them sideways. The only people with an excuse are the airline who honored the terms of their contract with the customer.  Don't like it? Please stop flying United so their fares will come down and I can afford to fly more often.

       That's little more than a training opportunity though. Certainly could have removed him more easily and in all honesty united should have raised the stakes to get people to give up their seat before calling in the goons. But this is TSA's america, there's no response too violent if someone is refusing to get off a plane. It's never the victims fault but this doesn't happen if the guy just accepts reality and picks his fight with customer service after the plane debarks without him.

       He looked foreign and frightened to me. If I were an officer I wouldn't have felt compelled to resort to violence whatsoever. Oh well. Legally it was his fault and I get that, but it's fucked up that we've come to this.

       I heard it was airline employees. You want cascading flight delays? Because not letting airline employees get where they need to be is how to get cascading flight delays.  Regardless flight crews might as well be Moses coming down from the Mount, there's literally nothing you can do once they tell you how it's going to be.

       All of those people fought government oppression. This dickhead was on private property, the owner(surrogate) asked him to leave in accordance with the contract said dickhead agreed to when he purchased his ticket and then the police had to be called in to forcibly remove the dickhead trespasser. There's no government oppression here, just government using force to protect the property rights of the airline and keep the flight from being delayed further.  I personally think the force was excessive but it's splitting hairs a little since some force was necessary after dickhead refused multiple requests to leave from flight crew and police.

       Not gonna happen, he might settle on police brutality but the airline themselves is in every right to pick chose and kick off who ever they want from the plane. Like OP said the rage should be directed at the police. If this was a muslim sure we would hear real outrage.

       Yes and no.  They have the right to pick and choose who flies, but they do not have the right to physically remove people from planes.  At best, they can refuse to take off until the passenger disembarks.  It's the same reasoning why most retarded l stores won't physically restrain shoplifters - in each case, the passenger/alleged shoplifter could have a potential tort claim of battery.

       It IS a public business.  They can ask you to leave, but they cannot physically remove you.  That's why they called for the hired muscle.  Of course, they are still responsible for what the hired muscle does, and that's why they will (likely) still be on the hook for a potential tort claim.  Obviously, final determination will depend on the specific facts, but from the public information that's the way it appears to me.

       If not enough volunteers are found, the airline has the power to decide who gets “bumped” off the flight, though that typically happens before boarding. 
Did you read the article? Or are you just a google warrior. I hope this happens to you one day. If you don't think this is wrong or and issue or done in bad light you my friend are a full blown idiot.

       No one is arguing that point, it's whether or not the airline staff, for example, can legally hit you with a hammer to remove you because you wouldn't leave - the answer is no.
      </p>
      <p>
       So the point is there's a line in the sand of what action individual parties can take with respect to physical intervention - what's in question here is whether that line was crossed.

       Yes, things changed since 9/11, but tort laws remain the same.  Air Marshalls, like police officers, are still subject to the law - with a caveat.  The caveat is that criminal repercussions against law enforcement agencies are nearly non-existent in the real world (which is an entirely different discussion).  However, police officers - and air marshalls - are commonly held liable civilly for abuses.  In other words, they typically won't go to jail, but they and/or the agencies/departments that they work for usually ends up writing a check.  And that is what I am talking about.  United AND the police agency will be writing checks.  No one will be going to jail.

       They want the same kind of candidates because they have similar skills. But the scope of the job is different. Similar to a bush pilot and a fighter pilot. Same qualifications to enter but different jobs.

       This really isn't up for discussion. Security officers don't have any powers given to them by the state. They are employees of private companies. They have the same amount of powers you do. Since this is the case they acted illegally because they did not have the power to use force against someone who is not committing a crime. This man did not commit a crime. They can only act to prevent harm. Not enforce laws. A security guard can not stop you for having expired tags.
      </p>
      <p>
       Police officers are sworn agents of the government. They have authority given to them by the state. It's a completely different legal status. They may give lawful orders and enforce the law.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's a reason it's a crime to impersonate a police officer and any asshole can call themselves a security guard.

       It actually should be both one the first part with United Airlines. I have been on a overbooked flight before they ask all passengers to volunteer their seat. Anyone whom needs to be there for a serious reason shouldn't get removed. And anyone who gives up their seat we got two choices. The first choice was different flight next up to our destination we were going first class or in our case the flight back the next day came with a free ticket anywhere in the U.S.
Next the response by the police is completely out of hand for the incident anyone else doing that that is second to third degree assault.

       The police are meant to protect and serve.. there was no crime being committed and no imminent danger to anyones well being, the cops should've told United to fuck off for wasting their time and had them clean up their own mess. I can't see the cops intervention being justifiable unless the man was legitimately breaking a law or was putting someones life at risk by halting the flight, Sorry but the "just following orders" excuse is nothing more to me than just that.. an excuse.

       Well I agree but I have had crazy flight attendant obsessed with my now ex not keeping his 6ft 6 inch body completely tucked into that tiny seat the whole flight and his size 16 shoes and foot smashed under the seat in front also.  He had one foot on my side and his toe of the other and his elbow sticking out and would scrunch to let anyone by.
      </p>
      <p>
       She came over probably 10 times on a 3 hour flight to harass is and threaten to turn the plane around once and then "force it to speed up because you refuse safety warnings and you will he arrested". He was a small engine pilot and called her bluff saying he'd love the pilot to change the wind speeds and direction so he could stretch his legs sooner.
      </p>
      <p>
       She eventually went to my dad in first class 6 ft 4 inches so he sympathized with my boyfriend and had bought all our tickets.
      </p>
      <p>
       She bitched to him or made some threats I forget and I am not sure what happened but she had a sour face after and ignored us.  I assume the person in charge told her to knock it off.
      </p>
      <p>
       This was pre 9/11 tho.  Now she would get him locked up as a terrorist or something.
      </p>
      <p>
       That said I know several friendly and reasonable flight attendants. Alas it just takes that one to ruin everything.

       How is it trespass?  Dr paid for his ticket,  got his boarding pass,  was seated.  I'm going to go ahead and assume his luggage was on board as well.  Airline employees put the luggage on the plane and put the Dr on the plane.  He was a paid customer who had already paid for a service.

       what would you have them do? Fight the police officers and get arrested themselves? All of those people gave up $800 because it was so important for them to stay on the plane. Plus, group mentality is a strong thing.
Put those two motivating things together and it's not surprising at all.

       But in that scenario, it'd be the store that called the cops in to brutalize you. So while yeah, those cops suck for brutalizing you, it'd be ridiculous to not hold the store accountable for its policies that made it all happen, or to continue to give them your business and expect it to not happen again.

       Nice to see, I just made another post saying the same thing! They're obviously trying to throw all the blame on United, so people don't pay attention to the police.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the victim had been black, everyone would be all #BlackLivesMatter, but instead everyone is just mad at united and little attention is going toward police.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, I did see that his employers are opening an investigation against him and spoke out pretty openly that they did not think this was OK. So hopefully we'll see these three fired. If they're not fired, then we know the corruption is institutionalized, which is a huge huge problem.
      </p>

       Good post. Cheers.

       The airline is absolutely at fault too. All of the flight attendants, the pilots, the police, and the CEO should be in jail. We lock people up for the stupidest shit. We should lock them up for this at least. The correct way to resolve a contractual dispute is not to drag people off and beat them. These people are a danger to society. Fedex and UPS treat their packages more humanely.

       He wasn't the only one, everyone else on the flight also refused to give up their seat and when the airline decided to randomly pick and single him out and force him off the plane. Moreover the man was a doctor with patients to see and clearly should have had preferential treatment, if anything, so they really crossed the line, not him.
      </p>
      <p>
       They were the ones that allowed all the passengers to board the plane and only then discovered they hadn't reserved enough seats for four of their own people that they needed to send on it but failed to make that known before the flight boarded and in which case they would have told the last people to arrive for the flight that it had been overbooked and that they'd have to take another one.
      </p>
      <p>
       You know, like what happens all the time, pisses the people left behind off, but is one of those things that occasionally happens to those who are the last to arrive for the flight, so in essence they share some of the responsibility. If they'd been earlier it wouldn't have been them and airlines try to fairly compensate them for the inconvenience.
      </p>
      <p>
       Had they simply done that the entire incident could have been avoided. There's ways to throw your weight around and ways not to. This was definitely one of those "not to" ways and the airline is clearly at fault and screwed up.

       That information hasn't been confirmed or corroborated by any outside sources.  It's apparently what the man said when they asked him to leave.

       Personally I find it hard to believe that a doctor would charge back on board an airplane muttering "Just kill me! Just kill me!" with blood all over his face after being forcibly removed by law enforcement

       Have you ever had a police beating? Or been knocked out and dragged out of somewhere?  Maybe he has before this and severe PTSD kicked in. Maybe he was concussed and out of his mind from injury and shock.

       Some of the problem with police brutality is that they have an absolute monopoly on violence. So even if they are abusing you, you cant fight back. That's a pretty terrifying situation to be in.

       I agree the cops were to blame for the roughness but imagine that you went to Mcdonalds and after you paid got your food and sat down the manager came out and said our employee has to eat first. Then when you refused to give up your burger for a later refund they brought in the cops and said you refused to cooperate and then sent in a pack of angry cops. To hell with united and those cops.

       i think the complacency of the people on board is also an issue, they could have collective overpowered the cops and killed them...they all knew how fucked up it was, but did nothing except film it...
      </p>
      <p>
       i think this should be a coarse of action every time cops abuse their power... if people see cops unjustifiably fucking with someone, they need to subdue/kill the cop/s on sight...shit will NEVER change unless WE start to change the way we act in these situations...peaceful complacency is beginning to be more and more impractical and impossible...how long till something like this happens to you, in any given situation...do you want the people around to stand idly by while your rights are striped from you on the spot by these so called "public defenders" or do you want your fellow citizens to rise to the occasion and put the pigs in their place...
      </p>
      <p>
       it's safe to say things are getting out of hand, the option to uphold peaceful resistance is fading...sooner or later, WE WILL have to take our freedom into our own hands and say enough is enough, even if it leads to bloodshed...
      </p>
      <p>
       all i'm trying to get across is,stuff like this only happens because we put up with, i hate to break it to, but bitching online about it, and simply trying to expose it IS PUTTING UP WITH IT... i'm not saying it's time for violence...YET, but sooner or later, people WILL take a stand, and i only ask that when that time comes, you stand next to them and help them as they would help you

       If a policeman is given an unlawful order (such as "remove that man, violently if necessary, even though he has done nothing wrong"), he has a duty not to obey the order.

      <p>
       Given how many cops are veterans, I guaran-fucking-tee you they know that rule.
      </p>
      <p>
       So we are allowed to have a problem both with the sociopaths who gave the order and the mindless thugs who followed it. They all deserve to burn.

       I agree 100%.  Cops don't just beat up and murder black people.  They rape, assault, murder and steal from all Americans or anyone that isn't also a police officer.  The Pro-Law Enforcement community is sickening and on the wrong side of history.

       Yeah I'm sure it's going to be an unpopular opinion but this whole thing reeks of emotional manipulation.  Somebody wanted a knee-jerk reaction to "police brutality" and they got it.
      </p>
      <p>
       We don't have a whole lot of context here, but the guy in the video seems a little out of his mind.  He's screaming bloody murder the second the guards even reach for him.  If you watch closely, the cops are the ones recoiling as the guy starts flailing around.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then, moments later, he charges back on board the plane and jogs up and down the aisle muttering "I want to go home! I want to go home! Just kill me! Just kill me!".  The guards don't attempt to restrain him, they politely try to calm him down.

       So I just logged in and this is all new to me. Hopefully someone can educate me on this.
      </p>
      <p>
       Was they guy asked to leave? At any point did anyone ask him to get off the plane?
      </p>
      <p>
       If "yes" and he refused, fuck him. It's not his plane and it's not his company. If "No" then what the fuck is going on?
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't have any opinion on this, like I said, it's all new to me. But if he was told by the person (or a representative of the person) who owns the aircraft to leave, and he didn't, who cares?

       What is the form of government in which a private corporation cannot request that the police remove a person from their private property who is there without permission? I'm being serious here.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regardless of the decision by United to cancel the ticket, once they do so, the man had no right to remain on their property. Even under full on socialism, where the government owns the plane, if they say you can't fly, and you don't leave voluntarily, they will remove you by force if necessary.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only system where police will not remove you is anarchism of one flavor or another, but in that instance, if an airplane company or co-op of some sort existed, they would have some type of security force to deal with non-compliant passengers.
      </p>
      <p>
       I guess my question is, what were the police supposed to do if the man absolutely refused to leave the plane, and the airline absolutely refused to let him stay? Does the owner of the private property not have the final say in who is allowed to use that property?

       Why couldn't the passenger also ask for help for the police. He paid for a ticket, he was let onto the plane and seated. Then out of the blue the airline breaks their agreement/contract. The customer should have the right to ask the police to help Him, to make the airline deliver what he paid for.

       The airline was under no legal obligation to fly him to his destination, and were within their legal rights to bump him.
       <a href="http://www.popularmechanics.com/flight/airlines/news/a26010/united-airlines-bump-passenger-rights/">
        Source
       </a>
       :
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "The burning question is, why did they wait until everyone was seated before realizing they needed to move their employees to that flight?" Hobica asks. Most airlines avoid having to yank someone who has already settled in to their seat. Technically, that is still considered a "denied boarding" as long as the plane is still at the gate and is permissible under the law.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       We can debate whether that is a fair law (I believe it's case law as opposed to statutory), and we can debate whether United was morally or professionally right to bump him, but I don't think there's much of a case that they didn't have the legal right to refuse to fly him. As such, the police could not force the airline to do something they had no legal obligation to do.

       Okay I accept that the airline is within their rights to bump him. Thanks for the link. But I don't believe the police should have intervened in this case, At best it a civil matter imho. The police could of asked him to leave but not forced him to. Its up to the airline to get him to vacate his seat not police officers, again just my opinion, I realise the police work for the benefit of corporations mostly.

       I could not agree more. The police should protect the public and not do bidding of big business. Sure, the business is entitled to police protection also but it is NOT (or at least it shouldn't be) in charge of the police. The police should know that. It is a mess that United created themselves so they should clean it up themselves. If it's going to cost them pretty penny to entice someone to get off the plane then they need to pay it. I'm in business and I've done blunders myself that cost me. Such is life. United can definitely afford to pay for their mistakes better than most.

       The focus should be HUGELY on United.
      </p>
      <p>
       They had a passenger removed from the plane (making him late for work) so one of their staff could sit in his seat (and not be late for work).

       United Airlines believes there is nothing wrong with how they handled the situation. It was UAL's policy to remove with force so yes, the focus should be on UAL.

       Now I have heard the reason this happened is that they needed to send some critical staff to get an airplane elsewhere off the ground.  Why should one self-entitled special snowflake, chinese or not, be more important than a whole planeload full of other people?

       The police has rules they must follow, and we have rights that must be allowed. All these people in this thread that are not holding the police to these rules are the reason why cops can do literally anything they want, whenever they want.
