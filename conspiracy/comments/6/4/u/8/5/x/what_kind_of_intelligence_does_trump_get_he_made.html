<p>This action in Syria also goes against his previous campaign talking points of not doing anything there.</p>

<p>I can only now assume he is under the control of whoever pulls our strings. The cabal, illuminati, the super rich, whatever we want to call them. </p>

<p>But to the original point. This intelligence he used is bunk with fake Soros white helmets. It&#39;s all a production. And this is our president making choices that involve the Soros agenda. Our pres is controlled and now part of it. We knew Clinton was, but I think it&#39;s interesting to see Trump now controlled for the contrast.</p>

<p>I want to bring attention to how dangerous this is. Our pres acting impulsively off of fake info in conjunction with the agenda of Soros. That just happened. It&#39;s going to happen more. Start talking about it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not the one promoting war. </p>

<p>Trump engaged in military action without congressional authorization. He attacked a democratically elected regime which is a violation of international law. And that wasn&#39;t the first time. He should be impeached, removed and placed on trial for war crimes. He&#39;s is just like his predecessors now. There is no difference. There will be no drain the swamp. </p>

<p>The official reports said Assad used Sarin gas to attack his own people yet the first responders were not wearing masks or gloves and touched the &quot;victims&quot; without protection. If that was sarin gas the first responders would have died. </p>

<p>In sorry, but you are promoting war and violence and that is not acceptable. </p>

<p>Again, this is <strong>all</strong> you have. This is not undeniable proof it was a false flag attack. So what are you actually basing your belief on? Just this? Going to ignore the official reports because you want to?</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m not promoting anything, let alone war. I&#39;m just calling you out for your ridiculous false flag claims based on flimsy evidence. You believe it&#39;s &#39;fact&#39;. You won&#39;t believe anything else because that&#39;s what you want to believe. If you saw it happen with your own eyes you wouldn&#39;t believe it.</p>

<li>Deep State gassed Syria, tried to dupe Trump into boots on the ground and all out war in Syria. </li>
</ul>

<p>-Congress would have voted for war. Trump took that option away from them. </p>

<p>-We bombed an airfield that didn&#39;t matter, thus in no way hindering the fight against ISIS (who is really the CIA/Mossad). </p>

<p>-Today Mattis says we will not be sending in troops nor will we seek regime change. </p>

<p>-Russia was warned of the attack.</p>

<p>-Putin says any further gas attacks would be false flags, thus taking that option away from the Deep State as any further false flag attacks would prove him right. </p>

<p>-Russian narrative is now dead. </p>

<p>-Trump managed to get the MSM on his side</p>

<p>-Trump knows damn well Assad didn&#39;t gas his people, hence why he went for an airfield that would not hurt Assad&#39;s fight against ISIS. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not a Trump homer, just calling it like I see it, and I think he and Putin just cockblocked the Deep State&#39;s attempt to jumpstart major conflict in Syria. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t care tbh. Let them shill away and downvote. Once you think outside the box and put puzzle pieces together it is awfully hard to deny what I just said. </p>

<p>Now, if we go into Syria in a month, I will eat my crow and happily take shit. But for now, I stand 100% behind my statement on the incident. </p>

<p>All my research points towards N Korea being the <em>real</em> threat. I have a gut feeling that they absolutely have ICBM&#39;s that are operational, we just haven&#39;t seen them. </p>

<p>After Xi meets with Trump, all of a sudden Chinese troops are at the border, and we have a naval fleet heading that way. Seems to me that evidence may have been presented that shows NK has become a legit threat to that region and KJU needs to be taken care of. </p>

<p>And it&#39;d behoove the world to do so before Feb of next year. Winter Games are in Seoul, well within range of NK artillery and short range missiles. Do you really put it past Kim to not bomb Seoul during the games? I actually kind think that the tension and instability in that region is the real reason the NHL isn&#39;t allowing it&#39;s players to go to the Olympics. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Olympics being there is adding even more interest to the area. And Usually the Olympics have the ability to stabilize an area because it&#39;s done in good will. </p>

<p>Is Kim that crazy? </p>

<p>Is he worth another nuclear problem and subsequent war? Cause Anywhere there is nukes there is the cabal raising tension. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wouldn&#39;t put it past him. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not at all saying an Olympic attack will happen. After all, everyone thought Brazil would be a shitshow and that turned out fine. Plus, a full on Olympic attack would absolutely bring the wrath of Hell down on NK, the likes of which we&#39;ve probably never seen, and I&#39;m not certain he is <em>that</em> crazy. </p>

<p>I just think if February rolls around, and he is still in power, BUT he feels trapped like China and the US will bring him down, that he&#39;d possibly do something drastic. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>But trump playing this hand seems to be self inflicting. Why Make a move militarily on obvious fake Soros crisis acting and bomb a basically empty target? It&#39;s forced and makes the act look incompetent, pointless, and raises suspicions like this thread.</p>

<p>Your other points are interesting and would suggest a trump/Putin collusion.  </p>

<p>Here&#39;s what I think. I think Trump was forced into this move by the military cabal who badly wants war. I don&#39;t even think he authorized it. Though he did go along with it, thus he is controlled and going along with the agenda. He didn&#39;t speak out. He didn&#39;t Say &quot; this intelligence is fake I&#39;m not doing anything&quot;. So He has no power. He is a puppet.</p>

<p>Putin just said trumps attack was a false flag and there will be more. Putin imo just put a wrench in the cabal propaganda and continues the Russia narrative in his favor today.</p>

<p>I agree with a lot of what you said I just don&#39;t think Trump is strategizing or any of that. He has no military experience whatsoever and I doubt he knows how to do spy games or false flag deceptions. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You raise some very valid points. Also, I appreciate you handling your disagreement with some of my opinions in a respectful, civil way. Not enough of that around here so kudos to you. </p>

<p>Honestly, I&#39;ve been doing rabbit hole research for nearly 20 years at this point, and I have NEVER seen things as convoluted as they are now. It is so hard to decipher truth, falsity, motive, etc etc. </p>

<p>Maybe I&#39;m jaded on my views because I want so badly to see the Deep State toppled, and I willingly admit that I may being seeing things how I want because of that. So naturally, I appreciate it when people play Devil&#39;s Advocate like you just did. </p>

<p>That being said; the whole Syria thing is really fucky. I do think the original plan was all out invasion, but somehow someone kept that from happening. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>thanks, we are on the same wave length. I won&#39;t go too far into meta physics but there is an aspect of it involved. Specifically twenty years ago there was a shift and people&#39;s minds did open and collectively we did begin a quest down the rabbit hole. We are doing this together. Well, like a third of us are doing it as more wake up.</p>

<p>I totally agree this is the most convoluted and dense and thick it is has been. It&#39;s like moving through alphabet agency soup. But you probably feel the other side approaching and are getting anxious to see it in your life, just like myself.  This is the best time to cooperate. Come together. We are approaching this unknown of actually removing the deep state.</p>

<p>Syria is totally complicated there is so much misinformation. We don&#39;t get a straight answer from government, media, and finding sources of info that isn&#39;t convoluted is a task.</p>

<p>What I know is there is a lot of oil going through there. And certain countries have interest in owning that land. Because the dependency on fuel ,in our mad max dystopian world, equals unlimited wealth and power. That unlimited wealth creates a deep state to protect it. Every source of energy has been hijacked so those who control it maintain the unlimited power of that resource.</p>

<p>The catalyst is energy. It always has been. Tesla had it, shit I&#39;m convinced our ancient ancestors had it. We don&#39;t have it but it&#39;s available.</p>

<p>Nailed it. </p>

<p>I believe the pyramids (not just the great pyramids of Giza, but all) were sources of energy. I also think the fuckery in Antarctica has to do with all of it, too. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not the one promoting war. </p>

<p>Trump engaged in military action without congressional authorization. He attacked a democratically elected regime which is a violation of international law. And that wasn&#39;t the first time. He should be impeached, removed and placed on trial for war crimes. He&#39;s is just like his predecessors now. There is no difference. There will be no drain the swamp. </p>

<p>The official reports said Assad used Sarin gas to attack his own people yet the first responders were not wearing masks or gloves and touched the &quot;victims&quot; without protection. If that was sarin gas the first responders would have died. </p>

<p>In sorry, but you are promoting war and violence and that is not acceptable. </p>
