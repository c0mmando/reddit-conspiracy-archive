        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Because for the last year, accelerating in the last few months, we have become a completely and obviously deeply divided country. The media has been blasting it, showing all the protests, youtube videos showing our citizens on both sides of the political aisle clashing and fighting, a million women in ridiculous hats protesting who knows what. The media portraying our president as a weak buffoon and a puppet of Putin, constant scandals engineered by the media and pushed by one side against the other on every news outlet. And now the wolves are circling. NK is seeing weakness and beating their war drums, Putin is rolling his eyes at us. Other countries are probably watching with interest to see what happens and if they can get a piece of it all goes down and how they can get involved. Love or hate Trump, it&#39;s not about him. It&#39;s about us, the people, and we&#39;ve done this to ourselves, all over a stupid election that in the long run, really would have made no difference at all. New boss, same as the old one. </p>

<p>I&#39;m starting to see why all the seasoned war generals advised Trump to bomb something and start flexing some military muscles. It might be an attempt of a show of strength to keep the wolves at bay. </p>

<p>As Lincoln said: &quot;‘A house divided against itself cannot stand.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Very good point bringing this up. From the article: &quot;Now of course the KGB is gone now, and whatever Putin’s KGB past and Russian nationalistic ambitions, he does not appear to be behind the ideological subversion taking place today. Indeed, the previously-subverted are the ones most likely doing the subversion today, like a mad scientist project gone haywire.&quot;
&quot;So who is waiting to take power, should Trump fail?&quot;</p>

<p>Who is behind this? I&#39;ve read theories that tptb have sucked everything they could out of this country, and want China to be the new superpower. A whole new economy to profit off of and suck dry. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not being anti semetic. This is all documented proven information.  </p>

<p>They played a highly disproportionate and probably decisive role in the infant Bolshevik regime, effectively dominating the Soviet government during its early years. Soviet historians, along with most of their colleagues in the West, for decades preferred to ignore this subject. The facts, though, cannot be denied.
With the notable exception of Lenin (Vladimir Ulyanov), most of the leading Communists who took control of Russia in 1917-20 were Jews. Leon Trotsky (Lev Bronstein) headed the Red Army and, for a time, was chief of Soviet foreign affairs. Yakov Sverdlov (Solomon) was both the Bolshevik party&#39;s executive secretary and -- as chairman of the Central Executive Committee -- head of the Soviet government. Grigori Zinoviev (Radomyslsky) headed the Communist International (Comintern), the central agency for spreading revolution in foreign countries. Other prominent Jews included press commissar Karl Radek (Sobelsohn), foreign affairs commissar Maxim Litvinov (Wallach), Lev Kamenev (Rosenfeld) and Moisei Uritsky.6
Lenin himself was of mostly Russian and Kalmuck ancestry, but he was also one-quarter Jewish. His maternal grandfather, Israel (Alexander) Blank, was a Ukrainian Jew who was later baptized into the Russian Orthodox Church.7
A thorough-going internationalist, Lenin viewed ethnic or cultural loyalties with contempt. He had little regard for his own countrymen. &quot;An intelligent Russian,&quot; he once remarked, &quot;is almost always a Jew or someone with Jewish blood in his veins.&quot;8  </p>

<p>What you fail to understand or recall is the treatment of Jews by the Imperial Romanov family.  </p>

<p>So go fuck off and educate yourself and keep the anti semetic bullshit to yourself</p>

<p>“And He has created horses and mules and asses that you may ride them, and as a source of beauty. And He will create what you do not yet know.” (16:9)
- Cars, bikes, trains, transport. </p>

<p>Maybe Allah&#39;s words mean something. </p>

<p>Or maybe both Jesus&#39; and Allah&#39;s words mean absolutely nothing. The &#39;prophecy&#39; you spoke of holds LESS ground than Allah&#39;s prophecies. His are much more specific. Prophecies about division among humans are bound to happen no matter what, humans were already divided when those words were written, no doubt. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Revelations talks about people who ruin the Earth. There was no pollution 2,000 years ago, but this seems like a prophecy that has come true:</p>

<p>&quot;And the nations were enraged, and Your wrath came, and the time for the dead to be judged, and to give the reward to Your servants, the prophets, and to the saints, and to those fearing Your name, the small and the great, <strong>and to destroy those who are destroying the earth.&quot;</strong> </p>

<p>Revelations 11:18</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Given how old the bible is and the many ages that came and gone, why is our generation or era so exclusive to the bible references? Why not the dark ages? Ww 1 era? All terrible times in history that many believed the end was coming. </p>

<p>Also most people in the world are poor and are living in what we would describe as hell provish circumstances. Only a small percentage of us even have the luxuary to contemplate these possible connections. If you are living in the Congo, you could careless if the US and Russia is going to kick off a war, you are already living in a hellzone. Its all perspective, if you have access to reddit and all these 1st world luxaries and you see crazy news you will think its about to end but in reality if you are working in a sweatshop what difference does it make. With the majority of humanity living in these conditions, a state of fear and anxity, we dont need a bible quote to figure out what is going on as humanity is still trapped in a darkage as we speak. </p>
