        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The reason the US and Israel are pulling this stunt is because their Isis plan eventually failed when Assad and Russia destroyed a large wing of ISIS and took control over parts of he region. The civil war was dying down and the US was pissed because they weren&#39;t getting the pipeline. </p>

<p>Trump is not this stupid. He is either in on it or he was mind controlled or blackmailed somehow. Of course, there is a small chance Trump made the strike so he can later use the error as an excuse to fire high level shills. We won&#39;t know until we see the direction he takes next. </p>

<p>This is absolute shit. Now they are trying to also not North Korea. Our government officials have become the worlds greatest terrorists. FBI doesn&#39;t help. CIA doesn&#39;t help. All these agencies have been compromised and it all happened thanks to Mossad interference in our politics. </p>

<p>How can the US do this knowing damn well the people are not only unsupportive but they are calling this whole thing a false flag. Our leaders are stupid ignorant fucks on a suicide path for selfish interests. They don&#39;t give a shit about you goys. Every corner of our lives from the poisonous foods to deadly vaccines are designed to kill us. </p>

<p>This is bad folks. This is really bad. We cant just keep swallowing this shit wholesale. Sorry for the long rant but things are happening so quickly, I&#39;m afraid they are going to attack NK next and possibly trigger a violent WW3 all for a few extra sheckles. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Every Passover, they kidnap children and drink their blood so they can feel like they are drinking their enemies blood. For some extra scheckles, they send the bodies to the slaughter house to be turned into sausage and hamburger and then sell the meat to fast food hubs like McDonald&#39;s. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Also, this is all a load of shit... don&#39;t believe the propaganda nothing good ever happens. By good I mean important. We just sit on our hands waiting for the other shoe to drop while nothing happens except we get further behind in our lives. Stay strong people, and if Jewish is a race so is Caucasian. And if the Jews won&#39;t let anyone but Jews move to Israel, then the Caucasians should consider the same. </p>
