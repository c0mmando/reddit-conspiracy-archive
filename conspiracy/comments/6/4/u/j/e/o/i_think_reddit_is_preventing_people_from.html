       I just heard about the whole thing going on with the Dina Ali woman and wanted to look up threads about it on Reddit. But every time I try to look her up on this site the search fails.
      </p>
      <p>
       But if I just put in the word Trump and search it works every time. I tried it with a few others words with similar results, topics that go against the narrative fail while ones that go with the narrative work.
      </p>
      <p>
       Something is fishy here.

       I tried several times to search for Jarrett because it wouldn't let me post a story on her saying it was already posted. 
Couldn't find the story reading through posts and when I searched for it I got "Sorry can't reach Reddit" several times. The one time I did, there was no story.

       Valerie wanted 30k for a graduation speech until the public found out. (And the university was in the middle of a financial crisis)

       There isn't very much talk about it on reddit. I only know about this story because my husband is a friend of hers. He hasn't been able to speak with her since monday and he's done nothing these past few days but try and contact her and raise awareness about her situation. It seems he's failed and he probably won't be able to speak to her again.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm hearing this all through him, but talk about a conspiracy. She was accused of stealing money from her family (apparently this is how they were able to stop her). Saudi news outlets are publishing stories denying she was ever in Manila. Her uncles hired a lawyer to try and trick her into not accepting asylum in the Philippines. Human rights organizations are politicizing the issue but not actually doing anything about it. From what I can tell she was fucked from the beginning and everything would have been fine if there wasn't a stop in Manila.
