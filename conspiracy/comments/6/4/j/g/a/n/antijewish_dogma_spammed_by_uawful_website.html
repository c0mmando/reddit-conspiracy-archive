<p>Not every citizen of those nations is supporting the agenda of the respective gangsters. In fact, I would hold Sicilians more accountable than I would Jews because the difference in population means the ratio of average citizen/gangsters would be greater. Damn those Sicilians, grr</p>

<p>Which law enforcement is targeting the 9/11 gang?</p>

<p>Yes i&#39;m aware that ethnic gangs target the culture that spawned them.  Yes. there will be a ratio.  My concern is that since Jews don&#39;t target their own gangsters, the portion of &quot;bad jews&quot; is going to be higher than expected</p>

In my informal survey of other anti-semite lites, I can assure you that if the Zionists get Americans involved in war with Syria, and/or Iran, that anti-semitism will skyrocket 10,000%.

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s your narrative, not mine. I hardly consider Jews &quot;inferior&quot;. Very few serious anti-semites would even say that. You need to rework your interpretative framework some. The problem is very much different, they are skilled and often ruthless operatives who push their own in-group power agenda. One certainty doesn&#39;t see an oversized Norwegian or Brit like AIPAC pushing an agenda in the US. Then they game and relabel anti-Zionism to be anti-semitism. That in a nutshell is my primary criticism.  </p>
