       This happened to me when my airline video went viral and to #1 on the front page.  American Airlines flight attendants were caught mistreating a passenger who did nothing wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       Made it to #1 here then Reddit nuked it citing, of all things, YouTube copyright! For MY video! Ha ha.

       I just love the knee-jerk reaction of calling 'conspiracy' every time someone's front page doesn't look the way
       <em>
        they
       </em>
       think it should.  Just because you can't see it on
       <em>
        your
       </em>
       front page any longer doesn't mean reddit censored the article.  My front page has two articles linking to the video, two more articles with separate discussions about overbooking, plus this post... and all of those articles are hours older than your post.  If there was such a conspiracy to remove the discussion about the airline, don't you think ALL of the articles would have been squashed?

       that applies to r/conspiracy as well.

       after the initial outcry that they were censoring posts, the creator of r/videos made r/PoliticalVideo.  r/videos used to link to r/politicalvideo, but not anymore.

       Yeah same, but something about rules and free speech in general gets a few people angry then all of a sudden all of reddit is up in arms about their rights.
      </p>
      <p>
       So I'm not objectifying an opinion, just soaking in and analyzing what's happening today, and this video from United Airlines is pretty interesting.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't all we know is police were asked to escort him off? Is there not much more of a story line? Or an interview from the man himself?

       We're in the same boat. It's strange to me that lots of reddit calls for "conspiracy!" from the get go, even though it clearly does violate the subs rules. I know as a mod myself (in a far less popular sub), sometimes you remove the highest upvoted things because they don't fit the sub or go against the rules. So I'm confused a lot by that point being made in how it's a conspiracy.
      </p>
      <p>
       But, from what I can gather, is that this man was beat up because of United's fuckup of overbooking. United asked people to volunteer, nobody did, so they had a computer "select" who to take off. This man was the 3rd of 4, and didn't go so easily. So they kicked his ass and dragged him off the plane. He somehow got back on, received medical attention on the plane, and the plane went back into the gate to "tidy up".
      </p>
      <p>
       We're in the same boat as far as I can tell, I have no clue what really happened. But all this "censorship censorship!" hoopla seems somewhat misguided at this point, especially if it was removed for breaking a sub rule.

       Funny how the company fucks up, sells more of something than they have available, and the person who walks away in handcuffs with a criminal record is a paying, innocent customer.

       If you see the way police treat minorities, the shootings, the treatment of protesters, the double standards, 'affluenza boy' and the the civil asset forfeitures and you STILL don't see that the police are only there to serve the elite, then IDK what will ever wake you up. Maybe you're still above the water level, but that level is rising every day. They are still faking the motions when you make a police report, if you're in a good neighborhood.

       They are used to protect the elite, but to say that is their only point is ridiculous. Most police are good guys and want to help, but because of the internet we only hear about the really bad instances and the towns known for police brutality and we assume thats what theyre all like.

       If the doctor calls the police and files a report that he was wrongfully (and forcefully) thrown off of the plane, do you think they will do anything?
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Most of them are just normal dudes that think just like you do.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       And this is the problem. Most PEOPLE are just normal dudes, but for some reason people think that cops are completely infalliable, and that people are all criminals. The police think that all citizens are criminals and the company is in the right.
      </p>
      <p>
       A company calls the police to have someone thrown off of a plane. Then this happens. Doesn't matter that he paid to be there. Doesn't matter that he was already seated on the plane. They were either overweight or they had a higher paying customer who needed his seat. Either way, he is not the problem. They called the police, they took the airline's side and forcefully ejected him from the plane. Everyone else was visibly upset, yet the police just couldn't see past their preconceived notion that the airline was right and he was wrong. And no one else was willing to stand up for this man because they were afraid of being wrongly singled out and forced off the plane at the hands of a police officer serving their master.

       They offered $400 and a hotel stay, when no one volunteered they upped the offer to $800 and a hotel stay. Still no one accepted. A manager boarded the plane and said they would use the computer to pick 4 people at random. This guy was the 3rd chosen, he refused stating he had to see patients at a hospital in the morning.

       That at least makes this not so completely wrong. But forcibly removing customers and causing a concussion because you want to throw some staff on the flight at the last minute is indefensible, imo.

       Oh I completely agree. They even let him back on the plane after the fact, to me that shows they know they screwed up.
      </p>
      <p>
       The people they picked are likely due to the fact that their ticket price is the cheapest. Meaning the compensation they are required to compensate for.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the passenger will arrive between one and two hours later than planned — or between one and four hours for an international flight — the airline must pay the passenger twice the amount of the one-way fare to his destination, up to $675.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the passenger will be delayed more than two hours — or four hours for international flights — the airline must pay him four times the one-way fare, up to $1,350.
      </p>
      <p>
       The time to bump someone from a flight is not after they have been seated on the plane, but before they board. Keeping in mind in 2016 United bumped between 40,000 and 63,000 passengers off flights due to overselling. Across all airlines that number is closer to 434,000. These numbers also do not always include volunteers.
      </p>
      <p>
       As a reference where I got this information on bumped flights see the link below.

       United offered $400 to anybody who would take a later flight.  Nobody jumped.  Then they offered $800.  Nobody jumped.  Then they announced a computer would randomly select 4 people who would be bumped, no questions.  Doctor was chosen.  Doctor refused to go.  So the airport police came to force him out.

       No, it wasn't "just overbooked"

       It was regularly booked but United wanted to move some employees, so they offered up to $800 for people to give up their seats  (4 of them) and nobody volunteered. Then they "randomly" selected people to be removed by "computer" and this guy didn't want to move, called his lawyer regarding his patients in the morning, and then was forcibly removed after refusing.

       Yeah I'd like to know what happened before this. They say they were looking for volunteers, this guy clearly did not volunteer so why remove him with force?
      </p>
      <p>
       Interesting things to note here is that he was "involuntarily bumped" which usually only occurs before boarding. The Airline might have been out of luck here seeing as the plane was already boarded. He was apparently bumped to make room for United Airlines crew. He
       <em>
        got back on to the plane
       </em>
       10 minutes later with a bloody face and apparently said "I need to go home"

       They wanted 4 volunteers to give up their seats so United could fly employees who I guess were needed elsewhere. Initially they offered $800 per seat but no one spoke up. Then they had the computer pick four people randomly. One couple was chosen and deplaned prior to the video. Then this guy in the video was chosen, refused to go, and was forcibly removed.

       That's pretty sad. There was basically universal support for the passenger and universal animosity for United, so it's not like this caused any controversy with Reddit users that would have led to them reporting the post.

       Pretty obvious this is Reddit favoring corporate PR over the benefit of it's users.

       We're always taught to stand up to injustice, except of course it seems when a police office is involved. Then, we simply sit back and take it. Or in this case, allow one of our fellow citizens to take it. I like to believe I would have said/done something if I had been a fellow passenger on the plane.

       You would have sat there and chirped like the rest of them. Anyone could have volunteered to take his place, but nobody did. Not for money, and not to help that doctor's patients. They sat there and chirped.

       It's ridiculous that that's literally what they teach kids now. Just submit, and take the cop to court and (hope) that you might win. Cops are given carte blanche powers to do what they want and it's up to us as citizens to just accept it because they're "the good guys"

       67 people voted against the Patriot act.  One senator and 66 Representatives​. 5 of those representatives would go on to become senators. So apparently they weren't all seen as traitors.

       Everyone is too busy pulling their out, hoping to record the situation and make a big payday selling it to the today show.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was waiting for my wife to leave a doctor's appt. at the hospital a few months ago when there was a car crash in the parking lot.  I turned to see what happened, and all I saw was a crowd gathering, with phones aplenty pointed at the two cars.
      </p>
      <p>
       I walked over and simply asked the drivers if they needed medical help.  Sure they were both agitated and hard to understand, but luckily only their prides were hurt.  Once I made sure they were ok, I excused myself from the situation.
      </p>
      <p>
       It makes me sad that people are so reluctant to help others today.

       They had every right to remove that passenger (being a doctor has no relevance on the matter).   Reddit is full of entitled shitkids who think everything is owed to them.  Airplanes aren't Government Welfare, they're privately owned businesses and can do what they want with their seats.
      </p>
      <p>
       They offered more than fair compensation and when there weren't any takers, went to another 'fair' method, randomly removing 4 passengers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whether or not they made the mistake of overbooking is irrelevant, it's their airplane and their policy.  The doctor should be pissed but walked off once the Air Marshall's got involved.  It's pretty simple logic.

       But overbooking means that there'll be a couple people waiting to get on that plane... like why are 4 people needed to leave? Does that mean 4 people were standing waiting to get on that flight? Couldn't they have taken the L and gone on the next flight?

       Yeah, I guess it was 4 employees that absolutely had to get to their destination to keep working today.  They definitely screwed up, not arguing that, but people defending this 'doctor' are just wrong.

      <p>
       It's not "his" seat, they made a trade for that seat in return for money and he signed knowing they had the power to remove him if necessary.  That's all part of the "trade".  He took it way to far, to the point of being physically removed.  Yelling, screaming, and resisting aren't going to change anyone's mind...at that point it was already over, he just should have left.

       Well, they could have just refunded your money and told you to fuck off.  Just because you paid for a flight doesn't mean you own that physical seat and can do whatever you want.

       No they can't actually. There are laws about refunds for overbooked seats number one being that they have to pay out at least 4 times the face value of the ticket and provide lodging if necessary.

       You're really going all out in your defense for United, but this statement makes it clear you have no idea what you're talking about. Instead of flooding this thread with comments defending United, maybe you should've taken the time to educate yourself about
       <a href="https://www.transportation.gov/airconsumer/fly-rights">
        passenger rights
       </a>
       :
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        If the airline arranges substitute transportation that is scheduled to arrive at your destination between one and two hours after your original arrival time (between one and four hours on international flights), the airline must pay you an amount equal to 200% of your one-way fare to your final destination that day, with a $675 maximum.
       </p>
       <p>
        If the substitute transportation is scheduled to get you to your destination more than two hours later (four hours internationally), or if the airline does not make any substitute travel arrangements for you, the compensation doubles (400% of your one-way fare, $1350 maximum)
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The only situation in which a passenger isn't entitled to compensation is when they are put on another flight which arrives within 1 hour of the original.

       No my argument, my argument is that the doctor acted poorly.  He legally had to give up his seat once he was chosen, go ahead and be pissed but don't say on the plane, screaming like a child to the point you need to be physically removed.

       From the video I've seen, you have that backwards: he doesn't start screaming until
       <em>
        after
       </em>
       the air marshals start to remove him. Admittedly the screaming seems a bit over the top, but the marshals aren't exactly gentle, as evidenced by the man's busted lip, fucked up glasses, and the passenger who comments "No, this is wrong, oh my god, look at what you did to him"
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course it's entirely possible that the video is missing some context, and he was also screaming before he was removed. But the fact that the other passengers sounded legitimately distressed and concerned over what happened to the guy makes me think this is not the case.
      </p>
      <p>
       But if you have a video or any other evidence of this guy acting up
       <em>
        before
       </em>
       his removal, please post a link.

       I was pointing out that you said airlines were not government welfare, when in fact, they get many protections from the government. Like this one:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        • Federal preemption. Many passengers don’t realize their basic right to seek redress through state and local courts doesn’t apply against airlines due to federal preemption; only U.S. courts oversee airlines. As the American Bar Association noted: “Practically all state consumer protection statutes and tort claims are rendered useless against air carriers.”

       "Overbooked" is a legally meaningless term.  It isn't defined in the contract of carriage, and appears only once, obliquely referring to Rule 25, which governs "oversold" situations.
      </p>
      <p>
       Logically, one could infer from context that the former term was used interchangeably with the latter.

       No. Who is to decide what "fair compensation" is? The airline? You? Or the THE PEOPLE GIVING UP THEIR SEAT. Duh. It's the latter--that's capitalism, that's supply and demand.

       The airline needed to keep raising the reimbursement price for giving up a seat until people took it. You don't FORCE people off the plane.

       If someone else doesn't agree that it's fair, they hold their ground and it goes to the random selection.  Life kicks you in the nuts and you leave the plane, that's the contract you got involved with.

       Not saying that at all... they at least made an attempt.  It was perfectly in their rights to just refund them their money and kick them off.  Instead, they "tried" to make it right buy offering a refund, $800, and a hotel room.  Life isn't perfect but I don't want to live in a world where a person gets whatever they want, even when that thing isn't theirs.

       They have a contract. The guy paid his part, now the airline is supposed to fly him to his destination at the agreed  upon time. Not to mention how fucking stupid they were to do this. Could have saved a few million by just increasing the price they would pay for someone to stay behind.

       I don't know man, I'm not in the airplane business.  Honest question, why do we have Air Marshall's?  Are they forced on the Airlines, were they requested, etc?  Do we put them on there to combat terror attacks?  I really don't know.

       When we trade money for services, we often "sign" a contract with additional stipulations that 99 out of 100 times are never exercised.  This isn't one of those times, United needed 4 passengers to leave the plane, when no one did, they randomly selected 4.  Those 4 got kicked in the nuts by life, I won't argue that, but in the end, they needed to leave the plane (per the contract they signed).

       They waited until passengers were seated and then decided they needed four seats for their own employees. If they had just offered more money, or something like an upgrade to first class on another flight, this wouldn't have been an issue. You're either an idiot or the worst shill on this entire website, there's no justifying United's actions or Reddit censorship.

       There's a difference between voluntary and involuntary.  They offered a voluntary amount of $800, involuntary they receive 200% compensation.  I'm not farming downvotes, I'm being downvoted by irrational thinking.  It's part of the contract one signs to fly on their plane.

       The problem isn't overbooking - they're playing a game of "futures" (the market price for a seat at some point in the future) vs spot market (the price of a seat right here, right now). If they can earn extra income from playing the futures market in their seats, it should help reduce ticket prices and keeps flights full.
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem is that they're not honoring the spot market. It
       <em>
        has to be
       </em>
       an auction that continues until they find somebody willing to give up their seat for the spot market price.
      </p>
      <p>
       What they're doing is absurd. It would be like if the Chicago Futures Exchange decided that the spot market price of pork bellies had increased too much, and they were going to seize a shipment of pork bellies.

      <p>
       It's theft.

       this "Reddit" censorship is getting increasingly uncomfortable for me. 
So much controlled narrative.

       If I can play devils advocate for a second ...
      </p>
      <p>
       I think what happens when these high visibility videos get removed isnt actual shilling (though it may very well be). I work for an internet hosting company in their legal dept. And we get requests for videos etc to be taken down or pictures removed. And honestly, sometimes, the content is legal and perfectly allowed to be there.
      </p>
      <p>
       What makes us act (sometimes) is the threat of a lawsuit and while we are a bigger company, we dont have the money to defend ourselves everytime we would refuse to take down a video.
      </p>
      <p>
       So Im willing to bet what happened is this: Video goes up. Airline company sees it and sends take down notice. Reddit says its allowed. Airline company says take it down or we will sue you since we cant ID the user as you are allowing the content. Reddit says "I dont have enough money to fight this long term and win, and all for what? So one user can keep a video up that can be found anywhere right now? We'll just take it down".

       It's even easier, videos has rules, and #4 says

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        No Videos of Police Brutality or Harassment
       </p>

       No idea why the rule was defined, but lawsuits are probably a good guess.

       . Im not removing this because this shit is important and people who remove this are corporate shills. You posted this when there was already 2 posts of the same event, each with substantial amount of comments. I removed yours because it's the same event and didn't have any discussion going on. There were a bunch of posts from different sources covering the same event.

       They were willing to shell out $3200. For that money you could put four United employees in a limo, drive them the four or five hours to Louisville, and avoid abusing a random passenger who will hopefully lawyer the fuck up and take much more than $800 home.

       claimed if violate rule 4 which bans videos of police brutality. 1. That's a stupid rule and 2. Police brutality wasn't even the major focus of the video. My god Reddit is becoming such a shitty website, and the worst part is they have the gall to lie to us like that.

       The real reason it was removed was because it was posted in r/videos. They have a policy where you can't post police brutality videos. The mods of r/videos removed it, not Reddit.
      </p>
      <p>
       I agree that's a stupid reason but that's what happened. See the new post for this video on r/news if you want proof
