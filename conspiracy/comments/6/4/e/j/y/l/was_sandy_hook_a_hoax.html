       Do people on this board think Sandy Hook was a hoax? I just finished watching the recently added Netflix documentary Newtown, which features many of the people that are accused of being "crisis actors" - and I have to say, they seem pretty real to me.
      </p>
      <p>
       If anyone on this board thinks SH was a hoax, I have one main question that doesnt add up for me: where are these kids? Did they never exist? Are they living at home with their families but everyone in the community is remaining quiet? I would love to believe they are alive, but it just doesnt add up.
      </p>
      <p>
       The hoax would mean that literally thousands of people conspired (and continue to) to keep this a secret. Is this one conspiracy this board doesnt believe in? Very open to hearing your thoughts.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        ETA 22hrs after original post (summary of what Ive learned)
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       While there are oddities and uncanny resemblances, there is essentially no evidence this was a hoax. While many youtubers claim evidence, it's usually just a long winded ramble and mouse pointing to things that arent really evidence. Some examples include:
      </p>
      <p>
       *a dashcam that didnt see kids leaving the school as per the official report. Explanation: the firehouse was behind this dashcam, and kids were led out away from this dashcam.
      </p>
      <p>
       *2-3 parents have entertainment/acting backgrounds. Explanation: this isnt so weird out of 40 parents, that some of them have this background. Actually, it makes sense to me that the ones who have experience in front of cameras, are indeed the ones in front of the cameras.
      </p>
      <p>
       *resemblance of one parent (wheeler) to an FBI agent. Explanation: ok these 2 men do look a lot alike, and while the FBI guy was really frumpy and handled the weapons totally unprofessionally, it's not enough evidence to prove a hoax.
      </p>
      <p>
       *parent laughing before cameras turn on. Explanation: Grieving people act off all the time, and this is from my own personal experience, as well as the many proven instances of grief not affecting all people the same way. I wouldnt probably laugh ever again, but that's not a reason to think no one would. Plus he could have been on meds.
      </p>
      <p>
       *no camera footage or photos. Explanation: I saved this for last bc it's the one with the most weight and least explanation. Yes, ofc I understand that you dont want your child's bloody photo on the internet, but at the same time, there are always leaks of this sort of evidence online. And 5 years out, we have no photos of lanza even. Why would we protect Lanza? Columbine shooters are out there, we've seen all the carnage. Why would there be zero footage? This remains the main point that has no reasonable contention.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thanks for mostly every commenter for being respectful, and engaging in a civil discourse. It's really the best. I got a lot of hate in PMs from both sides, but I appreciate the the public thread remained mostly authentic conversation. If you have to say something along the lines of : "you have to be a total [moron/stupid/idiot/fool/sheep] to believe [xyz]...you've greatly diminished your point of view, whatever side it falls on.

       Ive watched many of the youtubes claiming this...but how do you explain where those kids are? Did all of those funerals have empty caskets - were all the attendees of the funerals actors too?
      </p>
      <p>
       How could so many people work together (LE, coroners, ER doctors and nurses, parents of the other 500 kids at the school, media..) and remain silent for so long?

       How did all these people remain silent about the JFK assassination?  Or 9/11?  The NWO/Establishment has ways of silencing whistleblowers, and suppressing the reach of those who try to speak out.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are whistleblowers to the Sandy Hook hoax.  But they aren't given publicity in the Establishment media.  Reportedly, several former Connecticut State Police spoke out about it being a hoax.

       I have 2 kids. If all of a sudden I was claiming there were 3 and one of them was dead, there would just be so many people from intimate friends, to facebook friends that would say: yo, listen up this chick only ever had 2 kids we ever saw... it's really the part that makes it hard for me to accept that it's a hoax.

       How would you know if those kids were out there living their lives or not? They weren't the children of the crisis actors.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yea, all those funerals had empty caskets. No viewings. The funeral was a made for your viewing pleasure feature film like the rest.

       Sort of baffles me why peope keep asking how "so many people could keep this secret.." ever heard of the US intelligence community. They keep big secrets every day. Big, Big, elaborate secrets. Sandy Hook is a tiny event in comparison to the much bigger things that have gone on for ages. Compartmentalisation. Only a few people need to know what's really going on.

       Yes but it's asking me to believe that literally thousands of unconnected people (not people who are connected as the Intelligence community) are keeping this a secret. Like, for example, my block has about 25 houses, both Dems and Reps on both sides of the street, so to come down and convince all 25 houses to pitch for the same team, would be, basically impossible. So how did they get citizens of Newtown to do this? There have to be pro-gun people living in newtown that WOULD NOT go along with this...

       I think they're saying that these "families" of the dead kids were moved into the town around the same time and integrated with the population.  All these people are actors (including the  kids?) and all moved away shortly after.  To me it seems like alot of moving parts and tough to keep under wraps.

       OK, so it would follow (I think) that that means the other parents of 500 kids are also being duped...that it is only this handful of families that are the actors...which is more plausible than the entire town I guess...

      <p>
       Only a handful are keeping a fully informed secret. Newtown isn't a normal neighbourhood. The town itself and indeed the whole county of Fairfield has been a CIA training ground for decades. None of this would ever include informing an entire community, even if that community was entirely "normal". It's not like the citizens would be present for the event or get to walk up on it. They'd see it in the news like anyone else and that's it.

       Ok I want to understand you completely. So for example, one of the couples who is on the news a lot had an autistic son named Dylan. Are you saying there never was a Dylan?
      </p>
      <p>
       So if I was their neighbor, I know they never had a kid named Dylan - so why am I not saying so? Because I've been paid to never mention that these people never had a son named Dylan?
      </p>
      <p>
       Im just trying to understand how all these funerals happened, with so many people, and no one ever saying: "um...they never had a kid named Dylan.."

       Fake funderals.  All closed casket.  No proof that any child actually died.  They used fake names for the children who supposedly died.  The pictures of the children could have been 5 or 10 years old.  So that the real child is now 13-18 years old.
      </p>
      <p>
       Researchers have identified the children and their real names.  For example, see here:

       The families all moved into Sandy hook within 3-4 months of another and left the same way. Looks like they were planted in over time. They neighbours are on film saying they didn't really know them but it's really sad. Think they just tricked everyone. Their kids through it was real, that stress being a parent and having that panic and seeing your child panicking is enough for them. The dead kids didn't exist in my opinion. There's also a picture of the supposed girl that died with Obama.

       Yes I look up that girl and it appears she was the younger sister of one of the victims.

       If they really all did just move there and and move back out, that is highly suspect definitely. Im applying the lens of everyone having been there, and still being there (only bc I havent yet encountered the opposite info)

       I've seen some people suggest that the town was used for re located  woodsec/witness protection families. That's why some seemed to have fake id's and very little history.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've never personally believed in it being a hoax but lately I've realised the more I learn the less I actually know.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can only suggest you look at all the stories, evidence and theories available and come to your own conclusion.

      <p>
       Just be forewarned it's a very lonely path to travel down and you'll often be ostracized and shunned by others whenever you don't believe an official narrative and begin to ask questions.

       You think a conspiracy involving thousands of people is the "easier option" than just shooting the place up with one guy?
      </p>
      <p>
       Also apparently their system is appalling, since they routinely leave the most obvious and stupid clues, such as using the same people in different hoaxes etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       If we take as a fact (and it is an "if" the size of Africa) that a shadowy cabal organised this school shooting for some purpose, it is inconceivable that they would concoct such a labyrinthine and complex plot that would never appear as realistic as actually just committing the attack for real.

       Wow thank you for this ! I was only able to find Marquez as a newcomer...but you found everyone. This for me makes it pretty much impossible that it's a hoax. It's just to implausible that neighbors and community are ALL in on it.

       The families of the "victims" were already actors, they made millions of dollars from charity, the AR-15 wielding attacker used a shotgun breaching round (you can't do that, if anyone isn't familiar with guns), there was a coverup that made it impossible to see records, and there is dash cam footage that is totally inconsistent with the narrative of the day.

       There's a lot more to look into, but that's probably the big points.

       Ok, so the dashcam wasnt as convincing to me only because it's just one static angle, the kids couldve gone all sorts of ways.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do find it amazing that there isnt a single picture of the violence. Like Columbine had all that CCTV footage and even footage of both shooters offing themselves...but there is not one single pic from SH. That's odd. (I know they enacted a law that prevents release of these photos, but still amazed they havent leaked...)

       Sure, they could have. It's just really unlikely.
      </p>
      <p>
       The closest thing to a smoking gun in the whole affair is the use of a breaching round. That, alone, almost demolishes the narrative. No shotgun was found at the scene, and the only shotgun was in his trunk away from the school, and showed no signs of being fired, nor did they find additional breaching rounds, IIRC.

       Right, that's why I'm pretty comfortable saying "it didn't happen" unlike other events that just look like something odd is going on. The Columbine kids may have been put up to the attack, but they definitely shot people.

       If you were a Sandy Hook parent you would sue Alex Jones for millions of dollars for implying that it was fake, and be able to easily produce a mountain of evidence. That is a dead giveaway that nothing happened.

       There are frangible shotgun rounds that are designed for busting a lock without risking damage to people on the other sign. Somebody used one at Sandy Hook, even though the shooter only had an AR15 (which shoots 5.56/.223 rifle rounds).

       There is no evidence of a breaching round being used. The hole and dust that hoaxers claim was caused by a shotgun breaching round could easily have been caused by the bullets Lanza used.

       Someone made a video from one of the graveyards a while back, after which there were some alterations made - they came back and did an update.   Didn't hear about any digging though - you need a warrant for that.

       I think Sandy Hook was a "boy who called wolf" move. It was a hoax designed to be seen as a hoax to discredit all of the talk of 9/11 and Boston being False Flags on YouTube.

       Sandy hook was my red pill. Sloppy sniper playing 2 roles in 1 false flag. Sloppy sloppy shit. They even fucked up on tv saying he shot them all with an automatic assault rifle and there was shells everywhere and their wounds were 100% assault rifle  wounds then they filmed them pulling the rifle out of the guys boot after the whole incident. Clown forgot to take it in with him.

       That's a funny video. He has 2 different rifles, no magazines for either, and like 8 pistol magazines.

      <p>
       His armor is a different design than the other guys he came with, he's wearing women's sunglasses. I mean, it's just a mess.

       They trotted some guy out from a nearby office that allegedly is the guy, and apparently there are some records from him before that. But it's real shaky.

       i was on a swat team at my state prison, im also a vet.  I worked with the STATE hostage rescue swat team and trained with a few of their guys. very high speed.  There is no way in hell an fbi tactical member would ever in a million years be that frumpy, with the wrong vest(being worn wrong btw, the flap should be tucked in) the gear is different, they would NEVER carry their weapon in such a careless manner, etc.. etc. him ducking the abc cameras. hilarious.

       Look at how much money was funneled into that town. Not only to rebuild the school but moneys given directly to the victims' families by the federal government. Upwards of $50MM distributed to those affected.

       The lack of any footage of the event has always bothered me. Our media will happily show "sarin gassed" children on national television but yet we cannot even see a dead soldier or any kind of victims of terrorist attacks in our own country! I am not extremely knowledgeable about sandy hook.
      </p>
      <p>
       But Sloppy sniper and this other video of the kids and parents being interviewed and then literally walking around the camera man to go for a second go around always cast suspicion on the case. Plus making it illegal to question the authenticity while simultaneously sealing all records about the case, like death certificates, autopsy reports, and other important data like that is double suspicious.

       Right? You think out of mercy they would just release some autopsy information showing that the victims died of gunshot wounds and that would shut up a major portion of the critics in my opinion.
      </p>
      <p>
       Plus if these families are suffering it would be more humane to just stop withholding the information and just put the matter to bed so they can move on with their lives. See you around my friend.

       Actually I cannot find the source of this claim so I might of been talking out of my ass. But a man was arrested for making 4 calls to Sandy Hook Elementary and asking about the incident. All he said was that it was a hoax and he was arrested for harrassment. Although they could not actually say what part of it was actually harassment. Many people have been arrested for questioning it, but I don't think it is actually illegal to do so. So I am sorry for being misleading.

       So everyone thinks they know, but they don't. The children never existed, they are already adults or teenagers, the pictures presented to us were from when they were younger, no one questioned it, it is likely they were bought out.
      </p>
      <p>
       Those kids are probably working atm, or in college.

       Ostensibly because such a horrific event almost had to guarantee that there was increased legislation around gun ownership - but it failed in that regard. I believe to this day, nothing has really changed.

       I can't believe all of these comments.  Why does everyone think this was a hoax when all the others mass shootings are considered "real"?  I'm from CT and one of the victims (student teacher) was a very close friend of a friend who is now gone and her family has to deal with that loss every day.  So what you're all saying is this was just a very dramatic drawn out ploy to raise money? The minds of all you guys are so morbid and warped it's actually sickening.

       Yes I believe if the hoax theory has any merit, than the end game is gun control. But I havent really uncovered anything except some oddities around the story, but nothing really as a smoking gun.

      <p>
       Having said that, it accomplished exactly zero where gun control is concerned.

       I don't know much about it, but one thing that has made me suspicious, is that more than one person has said, "There was a guy who used to be a conspiracy theorist until he lost his child at Sandy Hook. He is so devastated that people think his child isn't actually dead."

       Guys i have been following Sandy Hook since it happened, i remember the day like it was last week, i was so sad to hear about these kids deaths, tears were comming down my face
The more i watched the more things seemed out of place, i believe it was 100% staged, there is just more evidence pointing to it being fake than not.
      </p>
      <p>
       I watched the live news broadcast all day and night, never were 500 plus kids shown evacuating the school, and if there were all those other kids, why have we not heard from other families, we just hear from the slain kids families.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the heck is Ryan Lanza and his dad after all these years?
Where are the friends and family to these people? 
Why was all the ambulances blocked in by cop cars and other vehicles?
WHY IN GODS GREEN EARTH DID THE POLICE BRING OUT SNACKS AND DRINKS AND SET THEM ON HIS HOOD IN THE SCHOOL PARKING LOT?
I have 2 kids that go to school and their school is super clean, WHY is there mold and water stains on the walls of the school?
Why did a lady's kid appear on the news as one of the slain kids when her kid was sitting right next to her? Then a day later they switched the kid when her mom wrote on facebook that her kid is alive and well and that this was freaking her out?
      </p>
      <p>
       So your telling me that my kid goes to school, gets shot, and i never ever get to see the body again? They just hand back the clothes? Sure ok.
      </p>
      <p>
       You guys the story of newtown is JACKED, i have not even mentioned all the mainstream oddities like in other posts, i do not want to believe that our government would do these acts but sadly ever since Kennedy and 9 11 i do not think we live in a truthful world, out of all of this you know who i feel sorry for? I feel sorry for US, the people who are being labled as consparicy idiots when all we want are these simple questions to be answered. After all, our kids are being raised under this government and it effects our daily lives, sadly i come to believe we are just pawns in a disgusting game of Chess.
      </p>
      <p>
       Stay True to your hearts people, love your family and love your neighbor, we are all in this together, lets show our kids we have still have a backbone and values, cuz you think its bad now? Wait untill we leave our kids with all this mess, we won't be there to help like we are now.

       I have 2 kids. If all of a sudden I was claiming there were 3 and one of them was dead, there would just be so many people from intimate friends, to facebook friends that would say: yo, listen up this chick only ever had 2 kids we ever saw... it's really the part that makes it hard for me to accept that it's a hoax.
      </p>

       Because there are things that are strange about it...just that one thing doesnt add up.

       If they really all did just move there and and move back out, that is highly suspect definitely. Im applying the lens of everyone having been there, and still being there (only bc I havent yet encountered the opposite info)
