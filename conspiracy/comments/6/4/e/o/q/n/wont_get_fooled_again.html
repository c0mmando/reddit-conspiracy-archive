    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s the moderatoration of the forum that&#39;s the problem.  They set up the forum as a pro-Trump forum only.  And that was somewhat understandable (during the campaign), because it served as a way to promote his candidacy.</p>

<p>An overwhelming majority of Trump supporters OPPOSE this action in Syria.  In the few days just before Trump announced the launching of 60 missiles, the forum was overwhelmingly referring to the &quot;gas attack&quot; as a false flag and almost all users were opposing any U.S. military escalation of the war.   I&#39;m talking like 99%+ opposing military action against Assad.  </p>

<p>Trump supporters are not a cult of personality.  If Trump betrays his principles, then his supporters will turn on him, and criticize him.  That would be blatantly obvious in The_Donald, if not for the fact that the moderators ban anyone who does so and censor/lock those posts and comments.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But all along we&#39;ve been saying he won&#39;t do what he says he&#39;ll do. He&#39;s been playing every angle for the entire campaign. It&#39;s almost impossible to know what he actually believes because he&#39;ll change his opinion on a dime depending on who&#39;s skirt he&#39;s blowing smoke up. </p>

<p>It&#39;s just now that some of you are realizing he&#39;s betrayed your trust. He talked about anti-globalization and anti-intervention, but he also talked about being for a huge increase on military expension. He spoke openly in favor of torture and war crimes, killing the families of terrorists. </p>

<p>Where was he going to use his massive military? Who was he going to torture and war crime? If we were going to be &quot;America First&quot;, then why bother with these things? He never intended to be anti-intervention. </p>

<p>Anti-globalization? He himself is a <strong>globalist businessman</strong>. He uses cheap foreign labor, he makes his products in China, he builds his buildings with cheap foreign steel. He&#39;s benefitted from the global economy more than most. But now he was going to shut it down? </p>

<p>It was all right there. This wasn&#39;t a surprised to many of us. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is possible to build up a military an not use it at all.  The U.S. military has been gutted in many ways and does need to be re-built. 
 And Trump said he wanted to &quot;take out ISIS&quot;, which most Trump supporters would support.  But Trump supporters do not support going to war against Assad.</p>

<p>No candidate is perfect.  I think most Trump supporters oppose the use of torture.  As with any politician, Trump supporters overlook some of the things we disagree with because 98% of what he was saying was good -- eg, anti-globalism, anti-interventionism, fix free trade agreements, America first, pro-gun rights.  </p>

<p>But you can&#39;t say that Trump supporters are a &quot;cult of personality&quot; that will side with Trump on ANYTHING he does.  If he goes against his campaign promises on the core agenda items, his supporters will turn on him -- as is now happening with Syria.  You may not see it at The_Donald (b/c of all the censorship), but most of Trump&#39;s supporters are harshly criticizing Trump on this.  You can see more evidence of it on Twitter.</p>
