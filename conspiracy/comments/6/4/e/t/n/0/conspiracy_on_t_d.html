        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Concern trolling was a rule to ban just about anyone that raises any good points that go against their views. Considering how many people have gotten banned. I was perma banned today. Not crying or anything I actually thought it was pretty funny.</p>

<p>I got perma banned there for this comment: &quot;I noticed we label things &quot;concern trolling&quot; when something goes against T_Ds narrative. Kinda sad. We should be royally concerned when most of us I assume have followed Trump strongly on his campaign trail and one of his major selling points was how we should not involve ourselves in others conflicts. Especially because this is one of the most obvious false flags in some time. I&#39;m all for trump obviously and have been, but blindly following someone is beyond idiotic, and its obvious from those that have supported trump and have spoken out about the missiles aren&#39;t blindly following as well. We should remain skeptical and keep open minds. Not arrogant, especially when the whole MSM is now praising Trump for his actions. That&#39;s incredibly scary... And its being ignored. I&#39;m just saying we should be prepared for anything on this sub.&quot;</p>

<p>On this post: Np.reddit.com<a href="/r/The_Donald/comments/64bnh3/i_am_here_for_trump_not_cernovich_or_pjw_or/">/r/The_Donald/comments/64bnh3/i_am_here_for_trump_not_cernovich_or_pjw_or/</a></p>

<p>The comment itself got nicely upvoted from other users as well which i think is the reason for the ban, however I was given no actual reason for the ban. I have screen capped pictures but I&#39;m on my phone. I responded by saying they abuse their mod powers and other subs should know. This was their response and I kid you not&quot; &quot;Please let other subs know what we&#39;re doing. Its great advertisement. It&#39;s not our fault you can&#39;t read the rules. Maybe you should do less drugs and more homework, sugartits?&quot;</p>

<p>They&#39;re complete scum there, and the mod clearly stalked me lmao. I&#39;m subbed to LSD.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Also, not sure if you experienced a ban yourself, bur if they ever respond to the ban they literally aren&#39;t professional at all. Someone mentioned a comment they had that sound like it came from a 12 year old. They called me sugartits and a druggy because I&#39;m subbed to LSD. A drug safer than Advil.</p>
