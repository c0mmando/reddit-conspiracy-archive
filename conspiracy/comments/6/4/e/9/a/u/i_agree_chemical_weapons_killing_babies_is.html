We just had a false flag to justify invasion in Iraq 15 years ago. Its still fresh on our heels. Its clear the citizen doesn&#39;t want us to bomb the middle east. The only way to justify an Invasion in Syria is if we had a new 9/11. Which we may just get.</p>

<p>And none of it matters cuz they are just trying to distract us long enough to not look up and see Niburu.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you wanna go the kooky but probably correct route look up Phil Schniedr Disclosure, I&#39;ve posted about him here. Goes into dumbs, alien partnership and pizzagate(tho he refers go to it as more of an organ harvesting op) too though. 1994ish. Was killed shortly thereafter. Suicide by strangulation.</p>

<p>I think you may be the guy that actually turned my head chaser. Like have you heard before Spring equinox there were a lot of 12 hour days in winter in places? I believe that they know that the world is ending so this is the last jump of political propaganda (Pg, syria, trump) to keep our heads up. </p>

<p>Talks about being &quot;shot,&quot; by an alien? An interesting man with interesting things to say, it is a shame he is gone and we can&#39;t verify any of that. I wholeheartedly know DUMBs is an ongoing operation and Denver airport is the HQ. </p>

<p>Really? I&#39;m happy/sad to hear that. Sad that you probably won&#39;t be able to unsee anything now.. but happy that the message is spreading. Spread love and peace in the days to come.</p>

Had to learn about white water and all kinda of billary shenanigans independently, and one of the worse things I found was a cost saving measure so they used lethal gasses and killed the children(of a cult leader but still children) then cover it up with a fire.
