       "This struggle may be a moral one, or it may be a physical one, and it may be both moral and physical, but it must be a struggle.
       <strong>
        Power concedes nothing without a demand. It never did and it never will. Find out just what any people will quietly submit to and you have found out the exact measure of injustice and wrong which will be imposed upon them, and these will continue till they are resisted with either words or blows, or with both. The limits of tyrants are prescribed by the endurance of those whom they oppress.
       </strong>
       In the light of these ideas, Negroes will be hunted at the North and held and flogged at the South so long as they submit to those devilish outrages and make no resistance, either moral or physical. Men may not get all they pay for in this world, but they must certainly pay for all they get. If we ever get free from the oppressions and wrongs heaped upon us, we must pay for their removal. We must do this by labor, by suffering, by sacrifice, and if needs be, by our lives and the lives of others."

       And once we become accustomed to a certain Liberty restriction they'll crank it up a notch. The recent bombings is a perfect example. Decades ago if some president were to outright bomb a country like that it would have meant instant War. It's on, that's it. Now you can actually go in and bomb a country without any declaration of war and it's okay.  Sure they make a lot of noise about it, but he's basically going to get away with it. There's absolutely no justification for the United States to use military force in another country without a declaration of war.  If you are outraged over their use of chemical weapons on their own civilians and want to go to war with them fine, but do it legitimately.
