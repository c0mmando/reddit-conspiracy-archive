       The FBI distrusted the hiring process for the massive live-drill on 9/11/01, and had agents living with or near each 9/11 hijacker (google that), they decided or were convinced by higher ups to stand down, as the live drill was to be used as leverage to invade Afghanistan after the planes were landed safely in NY and DC.  Iraq was pro-Russia traditionally, which is part of the reason Bush invaded there also.

       Except WTC7 came down without being hit, which means it was intended to be hit, so "Soviet moles" (getting paid by the Soviet Union?  from a time machine?  since the Soviets collapsed in 1989?) weren't in a position to bring it down.

       Their funding switched from the soviet union (didn't exist anymore and was trending capitalist) to leftist billionaires like George Soros and others.  The soviets were in a position to facilitate 9/11/01, from within, they infiltrated the west in the early 80s via operation RYN.  Never been disputed by the CIA.  Pilotless aircraft technology may have played a part in trying to ensure that the plane portion of 9/11/01 live-drill went as planned, (landing at the airport), for instance, if the hijackers were not actors, which they weren't, but something went wrong with that fail-safe.  Maybe that technology wasn't as trustworthy as people thought.

       Let's say that you knew the whole story but you didn't know whether the remote technology to land the planes at the airports was part of the story.  Would you not be satisfied?  The only people who could ever know if the remote tech was some sort of fail safe plan to land the planes safely or not are the people directly involved in what happened that day.  But if you could prove that it was a live drill designed to land the planes to get leverage to invade afghanistan that would be way more than the public accepts as truth right now.

       Easily infiltrated as some civilians were required to participate in these drills.  Think of how difficult a time Trump has had with his shadow government and then go back 16 years, before the recent revelations that the vetting processes for federal employees was a joke, even after Snowden's actions brought the issue to light.

       FBI higher ups were probably tipped off by the military that the military drills were taking place and that those actors were taking part in the drills, fbi agents on the ground level were probably wondering what those actors turned terrorists were doing in the U.S. and were denied by the higher ups from doing anything about it.

       All military drills have a hiring process for unobscure drills, which the massive amount of drills on 9/11/01 were unobscure, not an obscure drill like a fire drill, anyone with a military contact could have found out and been connected to that hiring process before the drills were even planned.

       Pick both, something that is classified can be discovered when moles are involved, people talk, people were involved in the drills on 9/11/01.  Your argument that if something is classified then 100% of the time no one can discover it, what I meant to say was "the correct military contact", not any military contact.  For example, if you knew the chef at a U.S. airbase in the Indian ocean that day, he or she probably didn't have the same level of knowledge as a higher up.

       Why would FBI ground level be inside the compartmentalized plan that hijacker patsies were going to go through any "hiring process" for a drill if only Soviets who infiltrated the "hiring process" were going to hire them?

       The FBI wasn't part of the plan when the hijacker actors went through the hiring process infiltrated by the soviets who hired those actors, that is why the DHS was created to get everyone on the same page.  Before 9/11 the FBI and CIA weren't on the same team, they distrusted each other.

       Except WTC7 came down without being hit, which means it was intended to be hit, so "Soviet moles" (getting paid by the Soviet Union?  from a time machine?  since the Soviets collapsed in 1989?) weren't in a position to bring it down.
