I, like many, just assumed it disappeared beyond the horizon. Counter to that, I can&#39;t get past the routes this ships would take if the Earth was flat.

    <div class="md"><p>I think you might have _ a word.  But I&#39;m gonna guess it was moon?</p>

<p>I personally think the moon is probably just as natural as anything else but there are a number of ancient mythologies that speak of a time before the moon or have similar concepts - I think such legends are generally considered the basis for that idea.</p>

<p>From <a href="https://www.varchive.org/itb/sansmoon.htm">https://www.varchive.org/itb/sansmoon.htm</a> :</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The period when the Earth was Moonless is probably the most remote recollection of mankind. Democritus and Anaxagoras taught that there was a time when the Earth was without the Moon.(1) Aristotle wrote that Arcadia in Greece, before being inhabited by the Hellenes, had a population of Pelasgians, and that these aborigines occupied the land already before there was a moon in the sky above the Earth; for this reason they were called Proselenes.(2)</p>

<p>Apollonius of Rhodes mentioned the time “when not all the orbs were yet in the heavens, before the Danai and Deukalion races came into existence, and only the Arcadians lived, of whom it is said that they dwelt on mountains and fed on acorns, before there was a moon.” (3)</p>

<p>Plutarch wrote in The Roman Questions: “There were Arcadians of Evander’s following, the so-called pre-Lunar people.”(4) Similarly wrote Ovid: “The Arcadians are said to have possessed their land before the birth of Jove, and the folk is older than the Moon.” (5) Hippolytus refers to a legend that “Arcadia brought forth Pelasgus, of greater antiquity than the moon.”(6) Lucian in his Astrology says that “the Arcadians affirm in their folly that they are older than the moon.”(7)</p>

<p>Censorinus also alludes to the time in the past when there was no moon in the sky.(8)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s a youtube channel called &quot;Infinite Plane Society&quot; that explains the entire thing as a continuation of the Reformation - he says the heliocentric model is the Catholic Church essentially re-asserting religious control over the masses, and that just as the printing presses originally freed us from their fear and control based religious tyranny by teaching the masses how to read and giving them access to books and written records, the internet is now giving us this opportunity to dispel a lot of the &quot;scientism&quot; and mind control that they&#39;ve used to attempt to re-constitute their totalitarian control.  Not saying I endorse his views completely but definitely interesting imo!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t understand how so many people can be against looking into this theory, especially people who usually question official narratives and TPTB who could perpetuate this conspiracy (if true). They say they only have time for the important conspiracies (which is subjective).

<p>Absolutly.  There are groups and subreddits created solely to brigade and downvote any thread with the &#39;flat earth&#39; keyword.  That is why the subject always gets immediately downvoted into oblivion if it discusses the subject at all.  You will see the same users day in and day out &quot;debunking&quot; in every thread.  It is over the top obvious, but the truth is out there and they look more ridiculous everyday trying to suppress the subject.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It might eventually have a Streisand Effect as more people realize that when an idea is desperately being buried, there could be some truth to it or otherwise they wouldn&#39;t bother attacking it so ferociously. It tells me someday is trying very hard to hide something. I don&#39;t know what that something is, but one possibility could be the space agencies trying to keep their cash cow before people realize those billions in taxpayer money have not put anything in outer space. Or maybe they <em>can&#39;t</em> leave earth for whatever reason, such as a flat earth with a hard dome, space being an illusion or not what they say it is, the van allen radiation belts preventing human space travel and thus proving the moon landing was a hoax, or something like that. It&#39;s all very curious. </p>

<p>With a Sharpie with a tiny shadow?  Seriously?  Are you even familiar with the experiment?  You realize the room for error increases with the smaller size of the experiment?  It&#39;s incredibly unscientific to use something as sloppy as a Sharpie for something that should be so precise. </p>

<p>Why?</p>

<p>Gravity is just a theory... right? Why do you <em>know</em> you&#39;ll fall? Is it because your lifetime of observations confirm the existence of a &quot;force&quot; that causes thing to fall?</p>

<p>This force we call &quot;gravity&quot; is not a theory. It is an observable fact. What causes gravity is a theory, but gravity itself is not. Even <em>you</em> know it exists.</p>

<p>This is like the spherical earth. It is not a theory. It is an observable fact. You may want to argue how or why it became spherical, but the fact it <em>is</em> spherical is proved by observation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The earth has never been observed to be spherical. No where. Ever. [Not yet anyway]. That&#39;s the problem. Globular earth is a theory that is taught to children, kinda like the existence of Santa Claus. Just because children believe it, because they&#39;ve seen artistic renderings of him, doesn&#39;t make his existence an observable fact.</p>

<p>It might be helpful to do a basic internet query on gravity. It is not a force that makes you &quot;fall&quot;--that is more-or-less a FE argument of density and buoyancy. Gravity is a force of attraction. No one needs gravity to explain why things fall on an earth that is flat.</p>

<p>The difference between the polar radius and the equatorial radius of earth is about 21 kilometres.</p>

<p>To put that in perspective, if the earth was shrunk down so it had a polar radius of about 1 meter, the difference between its polar radius and its equatorial radius would be about 3.5 millimeters.</p>

<p>Your quote:</p>

<p>This is a lie.</p>

<p>Do your own homework instead of being a liar.  Again, it took me 5 minutes to disprove your lies:</p>

<p>It took 5 minutes of trying to align the angle correctly.  Your inability to comprehend even the most basic of topics is truly mind-boggling.  At this point I&#39;m forced to believe that your lack of a basic skill set when it comes to critical thinking is somehow intentional.</p>

<p>The &quot;problem&quot; is that you don&#39;t understand how distance works when photographing a spherical object.  It&#39;s actually shocking that with a  human brain you are unable to imagine how photographing a 3-dimensional object from closer or further away can make things appear differently and instead dismiss all other supporting evidence and think the Earth is flat.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t believe that somebody who has seven academic degress could be incapable of knowing that the perspective of a 3D object differs when the distance between the observer and the object grows.

<p>Well you&#39;ve wasted somebody&#39;s money that&#39;s for sure.  Basic spherical geometry is something that Autolycus of Pitane started discovering in 4th century BC.  Somehow over 20 centuries later you are unable to comprehend the same thing even with <strong>seven degrees</strong>.</p>

<p>I certainly did.  In <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/648bqc/flat_earth_suntracking/dg45q0y/">this post</a> you asked <em>&quot;why the US looks so dramatically different in size&quot;</em>.</p>

<p>I pointed out, with photographs of a globe, that this is due to perspective and distance when observing spherical objects.  You were <em>unable to comprehend</em> how something could appear different in size on a sphere due to perspective.  You needed somebody to provide photographs of a globe in order to educate you beyond your complete lack of understanding of perspective.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why would you even bother? Why would you even care?</p>

<p>Because I consider blinding ignorance to be a plague on society?  I care about making the world a better place by educating people who are hopelessly clueless?</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Not at all.  You yourself admitted that you were unaware of how something could appear differently due to perspective on a sphere as demonstrated above.  I don&#39;t need to assume anything, you broadcast your ignorance without even being prodded to do so.</p>

<p>An oblate spheroid is in fact the most accurate way to describe the Earth as it bulges at the equator around 40km which amounts to  a difference of about 0.33% between the diameter at the equatorial plane and the diameter at the poles.  Just because you take some pop-scientists word as literal gospel without investigating it yourself, doesn&#39;t mean that you should inexplicably take it to the ultimate extreme.</p>

<p>It absolutely does, at this point the fact that you are incapable of admitting to or recognizing this fact is quite frankly incredibly troubling.  </p>

<p>The fact that you lack the logical capacity to draw obvious parallels between <a href="http://www.flatearthvideos.org/communities/7/004/013/492/017/images/4630417235_1018x509.jpg">this</a> and <a href="http://imgur.com/khpkC8x">this</a> is absolutely mind-numbing.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>The earth has never been observed to be spherical. No where.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You&#39;ll need to be more specific with your language. When you say &quot;observed&quot;, do you mean &quot;seen with someone&#39;s eyes&quot;? Because that&#39;s what astronauts see all the time.</p>

<p>Of course, you refuse to believe their observations, so you <em>must</em> mean &quot;seen with <em>your</em> eyes&quot;, which of course means that until you experience extreme high altitude flight you will never see it and can go on refusing to believe it, no matter how many other people tell you they have seen it with their own eyes.</p>

<p>If by &quot;observe&quot; you mean you can carry out observations that prove the earth is spherical, then you&#39;re wrong. It&#39;s quite easy to do if you&#39;re willing to actually try.</p>

<p>At least the guys on this stream are wiling to try, but I&#39;m sure they are not going to share the results of their experiment (or will find some excuse to explain them away).</p>

<p>The simple fact is, there are a multitude of different ways you can make observations that will tell you if the earth is spherical or not, and when you compare all of them, they come up with the same answer - the earth is a rotating sphere.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It is not a force that makes you &quot;fall&quot;--that is more-or-less a FE argument of density and buoyancy. Gravity is a force of attraction.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You&#39;re right.. sort of.. in reality you and the earth are both being &quot;attracted&quot; to your combined center of gravity. The thing is, the difference in mass between you and the earth means that the center of gravity between you and the earth is extremely close to the center of gravity of the earth by itself.</p>

<p>So in effect, you fall onto the earth.</p>

<p>The reason things float is because they are less dense than the thing they are floating on so <em>gravity</em> pulls the more dense material downwards, forcing the less dense material upwards.</p>

<p>Without gravity, there is no buoyancy. You can&#39;t replace gravity with an effect that relies on gravity to even happen.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>No one needs gravity to explain why things fall on an earth that is flat.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, they do. They just think they don&#39;t because they are too ignorant to understand the things they are talking about.</p>

<p>You won&#39;t do anything that might actually prove your assumptions wrong, unlike the people in the stream this thread is linked to. At least they seem to be willing to risk being proved wrong.</p>

<p>Oh, so the &quot;proof&quot; photos had been edited was that they didn&#39;t show what you wanted them to show, but if they did, then they clearly weren&#39;t edited? That&#39;s how your mind works?</p>

<p>Nope, I&#39;ve made observations myself which confirm the Earth to be spherical which was then further confirmed by countless other experiments by numerous other &#39;entities&#39; for centuries.

<p>Oh I see.. your idea of a <em>measurement</em> is &quot;seeing it&quot;. This stream is an attempt to <em>measure</em> the curvature. The people doing it expect to be able to prove that the earth is actually flat, but they are actually measuring the curvature.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>That doesn&#39;t mean it doesn&#39;t exist, it simply means I haven&#39;t been able to in anyway measure or observe a curve.</p>

<p>It is clear that you do not understand what &quot;measure&quot; means. The reason you can&#39;t <em>observe</em> the curve is because it is so slight when viewed from sea level. However, it can be observed <em>and</em> measured in other ways.</p>

<p>Here is an example:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IIVfoDuVIw">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IIVfoDuVIw</a></p>

<p>You can go there and do that experiment yourself and prove that the earth is a rotating sphere.</p>

<p>Here is another video that shows this effect in a different way:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jX7dcl_ERNs">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jX7dcl_ERNs</a></p>

<p>In this case, it shows that a bullet behaves differently depending on whether you&#39;re facing east or west.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>You just can&#39;t tell us any of them...</p>

<p>Let&#39;s just focus on the shooting experiment. The explanation for the difference in impact between firing west and east is explained by the rotation of the earth causing the target to rise or drop slightly while the bullet is in flight.</p>

<p>On a flat earth, the target would remain at the same height, whether you&#39;re firing east or west. So what explains the difference in the point of impact?</p>

<p>You can explain part of it by saying the earth is moving horizontally west to east, causing the distance between firing east and west to be different.. but then we should feel that movement, according to the flat earthers.</p>

<p>There is no other way to explain the difference in height of the bullet impact. Either the surface of the earth is moving laterally, or there should be no difference between shooting east and west.</p>

<p>Here is the thing... we can calculate the exact trajectory of the bullet, so we know if the bullet flies for x amount of time, it will drop y amount of distance. Here is the problem for flat earth. When we do that, we find that the bullet <em>still</em> hits higher (or lower) than it should based on the time it was in flight.</p>

<p>The <em>only</em> way this can happen is if the target is also changing height relative to where it was when the bullet was fired.</p>

<p>That means the earth must be spherical. As the target moves away from the shooter it also drops relative to its location when the shot was fired. As the target moves towards the shooter, it raises relative to its location when the shot was fired.</p>

<p>When we run all the calculations we find that the only way to accurately predict the impact of the bullet is if we treat the earth as a rotating spheroid. That alone busts the &quot;flat earth&quot; myth.</p>

<p>No, you need to explain how it confounds the findings, and how significant such obfuscation is.</p>

<p>So then your assertion should be elementary. Go ahead and explain.</p>

<p>You&#39;d be laughed out of any thesis defense with such a preposterous appeal.</p>

<p>It&#39;s funny that you invoke the &quot;scientific method&quot; and completely ignore its principles. </p>

<p>Or you know, all the work confirmed and preformed via the scientific principle whilst you flatties don&#39;t even understand the difference between powered flight and basic ballistic trajectory.</p>

<p>Or that the sun disappears behind the horizon.</p>

<p>Or any other number of scientifically supported phenomenon. Unlike precisely zero of the models, calculations and predictions offered by flatters. </p>

And then as others questioned the model a shift in consciousness created the reality we perceive now.

Why not just ignore or at least try to have a decent conversation to convince them of your point of view?</p>

<p>Perhaps they fight the flat earth theory so hard because they do not want humans to realize the collective consciousness can shape reality. &quot;The Powers That Be&quot; sure put a lot of effort in controlling our world view and it just makes me wonder.
