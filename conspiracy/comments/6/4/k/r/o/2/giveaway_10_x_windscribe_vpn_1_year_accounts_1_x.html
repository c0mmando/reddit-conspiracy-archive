       Greetings
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       ,
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm sure you're aware of the
       <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2017/04/trumps-signature-makes-it-official-isp-privacy-rules-are-dead/">
        recent privacy law repeal
       </a>
       which makes your browsing activity fair game to be sold to marketers without your consent. There's never been a better time to get a VPN to protect your private data.
      </p>
      <p>
       I run
       <a href="https://windscribe.com">
        Windscribe
       </a>
       which is more than just a standard VPN, but a privacy suite which consists of a minimalist VPN client and browser extension which blocks ads, trackers, rotates your user agent, blocks social widgets and more. We're based in Toronto, Canada and launched 11 months ago, but we've been growing fast and just reached 1 million users. You can Google us, there should be quite a bit of information about Windscribe on the Internet.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        The Giveaway
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm giving away 10 x 1 year Pro account licenses, as well as a single Lifetime account which is good for the lifetime of our company.
      </p>
      <p>
       Simply make a comment to enter the giveaway. Lifetime account winner and 5 yearly licenses will be chosen based on the quality of the question/answer/comment itself. Not exactly empirical, but I promise to be fair. The remaining licenses will be given out at random.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the mean time, since we operate on a freemium model (and you will need an account to redeem the license anyway), you can use Windscribe for free. By default we give you 10 GB of data per month (if you supply and confirm an email, 2 GB if you don't, since providing an email is optional). After you sign up, use voucher code
       <strong>
        50GBFREE
       </strong>
       to increase the free allowance to 50GB/month. That alone should be enough for most casual VPN users.
      </p>
      <p>
       We do not log, you can read our human friendly privacy policy here:

      </p>
      <p>
       I'll be happy to answer any questions.
      </p>

       Yo, I'd love to have that lifetime account. I'm old as the hills and smoke like a freighter, so probably won't be alive for much longer anyway. Also, I live overseas, and it would be real sweet to tunnel under that Netflix wall. I'm a bit tech-challenged though, so it has to be easy to use. Thanks in advance for your consideration. P.s. What are social widgets?

       Wait, you mean based on the Twitter account I created, or do you mean if I merely click, e.g., the ♥ on somebody else's Twitter post? I never do that anyway, but wouldn't I have to be "logged on" to be followed?

       You dont have to interact with it at all, merely having the button load on the page makes a request to Twitter/Facebook/etc wirh your IP, browser parameters, etc. It can also set cookies in your browser.

       Ho-ly smokes...those lowdown SOBs! I guess it's a good thing that I always clear my cache and Firefox browser history when I log-off. I'm not even sure that helps anymore, though. Looks like I can't even visit WikiLeaks Twitter feed now. Anyway, after reading Snowden's "No Place To Hide", I just assume the NSA is tracking and storing everything. But these corporate asshats...that really ticks me off. Appreciate the feedback, and again,
       <strong>

       I'm kinda sorta familiar with VPNs, I mean, I know that they allow one to surf anonymously, like Tor, but don't know specifics of the real difference. From what little I understand, they also slow down your speed, unless you pay. However, I'm always open to new ideas and learning new tricks, so long as they don't require high-tech skills. I'm late to this here internet game, and everything I know is self-taught, or from getting tips for dummies from pros like you. Otherwise, those "Windows 10 for Seniors" type books just push my snooze buttons.

       A few questions:
      </p>
      <p>
       Can the Canadian government force you to reveal someone's real IP address? I know using a VPN based in the US is seriously sketchy, and I'm wondering what laws you are required to follow.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you keep logs?

      <p>
       Is it fast enough to handle fibre optic internet without a significantly slowing down the connection?

       Canada has a mature legal system, and no data retention directives that apply to VPNs. As we keep no connection logs, there is nothing that we can provide to anyone who requests them.

       Most of our servers are 1gbit, however some are 100mbit, mostly in exotic locations. It's impossible to predict speeds, as everyone's networking is different and there are many other factors other than the network interface speed on the server. Best thing to do is just try it for yourself.

       Windscribe ... reminiscent of the windtalkers from the WW2. User agent rotate is available in Chrome extensions. Other tracker blocking is an interesting algo to see how it worls without deteriorating the browsing experience and site access blocking sniffers that prevent entering sites (like the use of AdBlocker is a big no no on many news sites )

       Hi,
My buddy just told me about your service and I'm definitely interested in the lifetime account. Winning it would be ideal but I wouldn't mind even checking out promos there might be, once I leave work for the day. 
Good luck everyone!

       I've had Windscribe for a few months now and everything is going well! The founder responds to your support tickets and i'm sure he'll answer all of your questions on Reddit as well. Great speeds and plenty of servers to choose from.
      </p>
      <p>
       I bought the lifetime license and its well worth it. I'm hoping to get one to give to my brother.

       The only bad thing at the moment is that they don't have an android app yet. It's been delayed a couple of times now, but i'm glad that they're taking their time to release a great product.

       I am amazed by how honest and transparent the company is. I mean, you guys literally just strengthen the Canadian stereotype "too nice to be real :D"
      </p>
      <p>
       I think in nowadays world pretty much everyone liking their privacy should either get, or at least consider getting a VPN. 
Id love to have a subscription, problem being im not in a financial status for most VPN's and i think i can say for all University/College students here, we simply love you guys, the 10gb itself is very useful, and it amazes me that you just gave away a 50gb code for everyone, much love &lt;3.
      </p>

       On a side note, i wouldn't mind a subscription if you want to support a aerospace n'gineer scrub in distress :D

       Found this service a while ago, and truly like it. I have not a question, but rather some situation to look at: I use free public wi-fi sometimes (that's where windscribe helps me) and when I connect to the chosen network (while windscribe is on) and i need to agreed with rules of network-use and here I kinda stuck - it shows that i've connected to the wi-fi, but there is no actual connection; so I need to turn off windscribe, connect wi-fi, open browser to press button for agreement, and then turn on windscribe. Just wanted to show some example, if it would be find more convenient (automatic) solution for this. Anyway, service is very nice (i did recommend it to my friends). Thanx!

       Hi, yes this is a problem on these types of networks. We're actually working on a solution for this type of issue. In the mean time, you can simply open an incognito tab, agree to terms, then connect to Windscribe and do what you need to do.

       I am a student.In my country libgen and torrentz and bittorent is completely blocked and I can't afford to buy expensive college books and course videos all the time because most of the time they end up being boring or useless. And many people don't promote torrents on tor! 
Also previously I was unaware of how our privacy is killed on the internet! Thank you for making your website/blog full of info in great detail.
Just one question answer it if you want:
Is your name Yegor ?
If yes then are you the one who smashed one ipod some years ago in Canadian Apple store? smashmyipod.com?

       Have you thought of implementing a DNS based proxy into windscribe, i think that would be highly profitable for you, and a really nice feature for some people. There are quite a few services like that, ex. Smart DNS, but they leave quite a lot of questions and seem way less about honesty and transparency than your company is. 
What do you think, and/or plan?

       We have no immediate plans to do that as it offers not much more than what our browser extension does, which has proxying capabilities.
