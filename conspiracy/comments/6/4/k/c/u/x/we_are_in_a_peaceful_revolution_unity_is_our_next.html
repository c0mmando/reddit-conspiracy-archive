        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>This country has been dubbed to be one of the most loneliest by many of my immigrant friends over the years. This is because the culture has really turned into an &quot;every man for himself&quot; culture. You take care of you, and I take care of me. </p>

<p>That&#39;s all great but the problem is that there is an imbalance here. Each person holds 1-3 gifts and each one of our gifts act like cooking ingredients. When we mix our gifts, then new experiences can be created. If I only take care of myself, then I am only experiencing my own gifts meaning there is a lot of room for potential. Suffering forces people into hopefully progressive action. Suffering overruns laziness and hopelessness and forces us to move. The very next major event is going to happen when all the surviving family nodes across the country are going to interlink into one massive cooperative system (instead of an uncooperative one). Many of us already experience cooperation in family but most of us haven&#39;t felt it across the masses. The suffering inflicted by our own hands is going to lead us to a united front across the country that continuously gets stronger and tighter. It will be a new experience for sure and many other countries are experiencing the beginnings of this already because they are woken up to the realization that without unity, nothing can happen.</p>

<p>I completely understand why they turned us against each other. It is because they don&#39;t want any resistance when they completely screw us over. This is why racism and prejudicial stuff have become such a big part of our society. They are even turning genders against each other which is very hard to do but they try. </p>

<p>The bottom line is that we need to unite before we can even formulate a real plan on how to shut these people down. A full blown cooperative model is needed. People really need to stop worrying about how much they can get for themselves and adjust their thinking and worry about how much they can get for all parties involved including the self. We are taught to take and take for ourselves but its more optimal to find a way to win as a society instead of winning as an individual by taking from others. This is how gangsters are born. Gangsters only take regardless of who gets hurt in the process. If we want to win, we need to be fair to all the parties involved in our every decision including ourselves. We are people too. </p>

<p>The faster we get adjust to this mode, the faster we can interlink across the country into a powerful unit which will give us a much better shot at ending this evil regime that is crushing our people. After that, we can unite with the world itself and watch these psychopaths go down like dominoes. Realistically speaking, this step is a must and all everyone is responsible for is fixing their own perspective. The fastest way to our goals (world peace) is to fully focus on fixing the self. A naturally united front will give us much more flexibility and many more options to work with.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks. Sure, a food, water, shelter setup (the basics) would be a fantastic start. That way, people can simply enter into this new society at will since the basics are covered and then the society would grow.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s communism from your perspective. You must be from the older generation who was brainwashed to call anything outside of the narrative communism. Unity is NOT communism. It is simply unity. I guess the family unit is communism too isn&#39;t it? Everyone works for free inside of the family unit. Should we all start charging our family members money for every little favor since the family institution is basically communism?</p>
