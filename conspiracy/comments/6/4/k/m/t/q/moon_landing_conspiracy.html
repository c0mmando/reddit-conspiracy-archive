       We faked the moon landing because man can not survive passage through the Van Allen Radiation Belts, so much money and American pride was banking on us beating the Ruskies to the Moon, that we were in too deep and faked it.

       You have a source for this please? Have the Russians called out US for faking the moon landing seeing as they have a stake in this? Also if it is so obvious, have any scientists/astronauts said anything about the moon landing being impossible? Surely, the integrity of their life's work is at stake.

       I can see where you are coming from but moon landing is one of the most iconic moments in modern history. I have a hard time believing that thousands of people, who have spent countless hours of their lives studying this kind of stuff, are be willing to remain silent. I just don't see what scientists have to gain from spreading such an "obvious" lie. It's not like the moon landing was recent either.

       If Russia called us out, would you hear about that?
      </p>
      <p>
       If scientists call it out they stand a strong chance of losing their irreplaceable careers. The integrity of their life's work depends entirely on not making waves. and  yet, yes, they do occasionally forget how massively they've lied in the past such as what is said in the following
      </p>

       NASA engineer admits humans can't get past the Van Allen Belts  {7:01}

      </p>
      <p>
       There are plenty of indications that we faked the moon landing
      </p>

      </p>
      <p>
       Lastly, is this a highly engineered space vehicle capable of withstanding massive gravitational force from liftoff, landing and liftoff again? I think it's a joke that's missing its punch line. This thing wouldn't stand just lifting it with a fork lift.

       Thanks for the answer. Maybe I'm mistaken but the engineer doesn't say we can't get through. He says it's dangerous and that the ship would need extra protection in order to counter the harmful radiation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's say that there are scientists being told to lie. How about the thousands of other people that don't fall under NASA/US government jurisdiction. Surely they can't all be threatened? Also, why wouldn't we know if Russia called us out? Some news outlets may smear the claims and block them out but there are plenty of other sources of information.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is considered one of the biggest accomplishments in human history. I doubt the truth could be hidden like this, especially since it's one of the most popular conspiracy theories around. There are plenty of people waiting for concrete truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       I just think this whole thing depends too much on people keeping their mouths shut. Does Nasa hold yearly seminars about what you can and cannot say? Aren't there bound to be disgruntled former employees that would be frothing at the mouth to leak this stuff?

       Ever hear of the Manhattan project? There are many  kinds of coercion. There are non disclosure agreements , threats both overt and implied, bonuses,  covert direct action, blackmail, bribes, National Security Letters, and even appeals to patriotism.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'll leave the subject saying  that if we could do it in 1969 we should be able to do it today but we can't.
      </p>
      <p>
       The landing was all too near impossible but it was a national pride imperative
       <br/>
       It was a  political tool. near impossible to do, easy to fake.
      </p>
      <p>
       Cape Canaveral had a complete camera ready sound stage  trapped out as a moonscape,  that allowed tourists.
      </p>
      <p>
       All they needed to do was shoo all the touristas away and roll film.  They probably did just that.

       If we did fake the moon landing, wheres the evidence at? Also Dr. James van Allen, the person who discovered the van Allen belts, rebutted the claims that the belts were too harmful for the astronauts.

       Good. There's pretty conclusive proof we've been to the moon already - I understand the theories around the original landing, but the later ones are incredibly hard to debunk.

       Some will point to moon reflectors, and others will point to Russia's reflectors and say it others have reflectors there too.

       , where Russia, initially so ahead of the game, struggled so much getting even unmanned crafts to the moon and be amazed at the efficiency of Nixon compared to the more advanced Russians.

        Now lets be realistic. Do you really think, when even NOW nasa can't predict solar flare events, that they would send that many missions to the moon, with 1/185th the required shielding NASA's own study says they need to protect against solar flares, when the results could be the catastrophic deaths on live tv during the cold war when national pride was at stake? When the above study even proves the solar minimum offers MORE of a threat than solar maximum? The moon missions are laughable.

       Just a heads up:
      </p>
      <p>
       Anything surrounding the moon landing hoax, NASA's obvious CGI fake images and the shape of the planet is being censored and shilled on this sub big time.
      </p>
      <p>
       Any regular reader of r/conspiracy will have seen the incredibly poorly researched flat Earth videos that look like a child made them. These videos are spammed and the mods leave them alone because they are discrediting the theory.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, there was a flat Earth thread posted the other day. It was simply a video of a scientific experiment. The guy who posted it was the opposite of these spammers who are out to discredit, he was smart and was able to argue his point intelligently. The mods deleted his thread any banned him for "asking for upvotes", which is just a ridiculous excuse and he certainly did not do that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Was this guy censored because he was smart enough to deal with the trolls and argue his point?

       I don't buy the flat earth theory, but I do enjoy learning and hearing all view points.  Would you by chance have a link?

       Regardless if we actually went to the moon, I'm positive that the footage shown on American tv sets was filmed by Stanley Kubrick.

       I can see where you are coming from but moon landing is one of the most iconic moments in modern history. I have a hard time believing that thousands of people, who have spent countless hours of their lives studying this kind of stuff, are be willing to remain silent. I just don't see what scientists have to gain from spreading such an "obvious" lie. It's not like the moon landing was recent either.
