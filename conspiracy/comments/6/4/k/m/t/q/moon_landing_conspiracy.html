    <div class="md"><p>If Russia called us out, would you hear about that? </p>

<p>If scientists call it out they stand a strong chance of losing their irreplaceable careers. The integrity of their life&#39;s work depends entirely on not making waves. and  yet, yes, they do occasionally forget how massively they&#39;ve lied in the past such as what is said in the following </p>

<p>NASA engineer admits humans can&#39;t get past the Van Allen Belts  {7:01}</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NlXG0REiVzE&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NlXG0REiVzE&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be</a></p>

<p>There are plenty of indications that we faked the moon landing</p>

<p><a href="http://aulis.com/">http://aulis.com/</a></p>

<p>Lastly, is this a highly engineered space vehicle capable of withstanding massive gravitational force from liftoff, landing and liftoff again? I think it&#39;s a joke that&#39;s missing its punch line. This thing wouldn&#39;t stand just lifting it with a fork lift.</p>

<p>Such fine craftsmanship in materials and joinery. Be proud America.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for the answer. Maybe I&#39;m mistaken but the engineer doesn&#39;t say we can&#39;t get through. He says it&#39;s dangerous and that the ship would need extra protection in order to counter the harmful radiation.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s say that there are scientists being told to lie. How about the thousands of other people that don&#39;t fall under NASA/US government jurisdiction. Surely they can&#39;t all be threatened? Also, why wouldn&#39;t we know if Russia called us out? Some news outlets may smear the claims and block them out but there are plenty of other sources of information.</p>

<p>This is considered one of the biggest accomplishments in human history. I doubt the truth could be hidden like this, especially since it&#39;s one of the most popular conspiracy theories around. There are plenty of people waiting for concrete truth.</p>

<p>I just think this whole thing depends too much on people keeping their mouths shut. Does Nasa hold yearly seminars about what you can and cannot say? Aren&#39;t there bound to be disgruntled former employees that would be frothing at the mouth to leak this stuff? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ever hear of the Manhattan project? There are many  kinds of coercion. There are non disclosure agreements , threats both overt and implied, bonuses,  covert direct action, blackmail, bribes, National Security Letters, and even appeals to patriotism.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll leave the subject saying  that if we could do it in 1969 we should be able to do it today but we can&#39;t.</p>

<p>The landing was all too near impossible but it was a national pride imperative<br/>
It was a  political tool. near impossible to do, easy to fake.</p>

<p>Cape Canaveral had a complete camera ready sound stage  trapped out as a moonscape,  that allowed tourists. </p>

<p>All they needed to do was shoo all the touristas away and roll film.  They probably did just that.</p>

<p>Now lets be realistic. Do you really think, when even NOW nasa can&#39;t predict solar flare events, that they would send that many missions to the moon, with 1/185th the required shielding NASA&#39;s own study says they need to protect against solar flares, when the results could be the catastrophic deaths on live tv during the cold war when national pride was at stake? When the above study even proves the solar minimum offers MORE of a threat than solar maximum? The moon missions are laughable.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just a heads up: </p>

<p>Anything surrounding the moon landing hoax, NASA&#39;s obvious CGI fake images and the shape of the planet is being censored and shilled on this sub big time.</p>

<p>Any regular reader of r/conspiracy will have seen the incredibly poorly researched flat Earth videos that look like a child made them. These videos are spammed and the mods leave them alone because they are discrediting the theory. </p>

<p>Now, there was a flat Earth thread posted the other day. It was simply a video of a scientific experiment. The guy who posted it was the opposite of these spammers who are out to discredit, he was smart and was able to argue his point intelligently. The mods deleted his thread any banned him for &quot;asking for upvotes&quot;, which is just a ridiculous excuse and he certainly did not do that.</p>

<p>Was this guy censored because he was smart enough to deal with the trolls and argue his point? </p>

<p>Seriously sketchy, guys. </p>
