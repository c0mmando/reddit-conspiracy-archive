       Even I am against ousting Assad, but the man is FOR sure a criminal dictator. Find articles before the civil war on what was happening to peaceful opposition protesters, his state security apparatus, and how his family corrupted the government.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just because the rebels are fucking crazy Islamists, doesn't mean Assad and his regime are angels from Heaven. I do believe the recent Sarin gas attack was a false flag, and at the end of the day I would rather have Assad in control of the government and people of Syria than the Islamists.

       Whose else regime you can't stand studentthrowaway1? Any particular personal reason you can't stand Assad? You're making it sound like you lived there.

       To me all M.E. leaders are dictators because well that's how it's always been there and frankly Assad seems like the lesser of all evils. So why would I put all this energy convincing everyone he's such a bad guy? His country is under attack and he's been resilient against all the lies meanwhile Saudis are chopping heads but when was the last time you complained?

       Either that or every politician American's don't like is labeled a dictator.

       Putin and Assad both have higher approval ratings in their respective countries than any American president in your lifetime. Were they all dictators as well?

       You're right. It's just that a lot of people here want to see the world as black and white.

      <p>
       What do you mean by 'the rebels'? The problem with the Syrian Civil War is that there isn't a homogenous group known as 'the rebels'. There have been a huge number of groups fighting against Assad; some, like the Free Syrian Army and the Kurdish forces, absolutely deserved support from the Coalition, and arguably didn't receive enough support.
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem is that after the early stage of the war, the rise of ISIS and the increasing involvement of Hezbollah and the Iranian Revolutionary Guard on the side of Assad led to the growth of the likes of the Al-Nusra Front (or Al Qaeda in Syria) as prominent parts of the rebellion, coinciding with the decline of the moderate rebels.

       Let's call them what they all are, shall we... they're
       <em>
        fundamentalist
       </em>
       rebels all allied with various Sunni Islamic sects... and they are ALL determined to destroy the secular nature of Syria and rid it of everyone who isn't a Sunni, namely Christians, Jews, and all the Alawite and Shia Muslims who have peacefully lived there together and share common goals precisely because it is a secular state.
      </p>
      <p>
       And they are modern and civilized goals that they have had a tremendous amount of difficulty preserving and trying to advance because of a substantial number of Sunni fundamentalists supported by other Sunni and Wahhabi fundamentalists outside of Syria that have been doing everything they can to disrupt and prevent those goals from being properly fulfilled. So the Syrian government is dealing with an adversary that is quite willing to plot against, bomb, and assassinate both members of the government as well as anyone belonging to that non-Sunni part of the population in order to achieve that end. So it's a situation where the government can't afford to not deal harshly or be heavy-handed with because of the dangerous nature and constant threat to the peace that element represents.

       Shouldn't have supported any of the forces that fight against Assad, in my opinion. Removing the power structure in Iraq is what gave to rise to ISIS.
      </p>
      <p>
       Support to Kurdish forces is ok, but I don't think they even fight Assad, they've been fighting against ISIS.
      </p>
      <p>
       In my view the priority threat is ISIS, because they're the ones who want to attack USA and Europe. This threat is best fought by supporting Assad. Supporting the rebels will just prolong the fight, giving ISIS more space to operate.

       Poorly biased source bullshit war propaganda? Oh wow im so convinced now. What benefit could possibly come to the US economy from a war in Syria.
      </p>
      <p>
       Assad had 0 benefit from gassing those people and knows idiots like you would try to paint him in such a light, which is exactly why he didn't do it.
      </p>
      <p>
       ISIS murdered dozens of actual Syrian soldiers though, probably with money America gave them. It's on video I can share with you proving it was them (unlike the chemical attack) if you like.

       It's not a strawman when you choosee to side with "moderate rebels" aka Al-Nusra and Al-Qaeda and ISIS, the same people they just opposed for ten years.

       You admit which side you are on. The legal established leadership is fighting western funded rebels. You choose the rebels.

       Lol. He won his first two presidential elections as the only candidate and he won the third because most of the people who were actually opposed to the regime boycotted the election and the polls were mostly open in government controlled territory.

       Start packing your bags then.  If you ask nicely Saudi Arabia will probably buy you a plane ticket and sneak you across the border and arm you.

        Barack Obama dropped 21,000 bombs last year in Syria, many of which were of questionable legality.

       Those "civilians" as you report them:
      </p>
      <p>
       Are paid Al-Nusra, Al-Qaeda, and ISIS terrorist who are trying to topple his legitimate (and wildly popular in the area) government. The only issue is that Assad is so beloved by the true people of Syria (and not the terrorists Americans supposedly hate so much) that people like Dick Cheney and Hillary Clinton have been having a real hard fucking time removing Assad from power.
      </p>
      <p>
       In fact, they've killed many people trying. Many more people than Assad. Maybe they should go first?

       Americans have no problem when their allies Israel use illegal white phospherous on children in attacks that had far more evidence against the state than the recent ones in Syria.

       You jail your own criminals by creating increasingly strict laws and labeling soft drug users as serious offenders.
      </p>
      <p>
       You jail your own criminals with stop and frisk (something that doesnt even exist in Syria)
      </p>
      <p>
       You also allow immigrants in you know won't assimilate, specifically to jail them for cheap slave labor.

       That, and your argument supports ISIS. You are spouting extremist narratives. I hope you are happy with your life.

       Lol i read plenty thank you, but I'm sorry I'm just waiting to hear why you would use stop and frisk and Syria in the same breath.. 😉😉, and why you would bring up US incarceration as a talking point, the only comment made was about ASSAD.   You've drawn no real relevancy on any of those issues and Assad, other than we bombed Syria a ton already.

       There are no issues with Assad. He is defending people from Terrorists in illegally occupied areas, many of which have been illegally occupied for over for years.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you don't want to get bombed, leave the place you are illegally located. It's pretty simple.
      </p>
      <p>
       They had plenty of notice, they choose to illegally occupy the area. You support terrorism in Syria. You support the terrorists.

       Those reports and articles are worthless considering the Bush admin and Neocons had been planning to overthrow the Syria government before those reports were issued. Not to mention HRW has a revolving door policy with the CIA.
      </p>
      <p>
       The clandestine operations that the US started engaging in after ~2005 in Syria, Lebanon, and Libya alongside Sunni militants arguably had a huge role to play in the rise of ISIS; just as much of a role as the devastation of Iraq did.

       Liz Cheney (Dick Cheney’s daughter) began funding opposition groups in Syria and Iran as far back as 2005:

      <p>
       And another revelation from 2005 about Syrian and Lebanese regime change made by Neocon, Ziad Abdel Nour, founder of Blackhawk Partners, an investing firm/private intelligence agency:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "Both the Syrian and Lebanese regimes will be changed whether they like it or not whether it's going to be a military coup or something else... and we are working on it. We know already exactly who's going to be the replacements. We're working on it with the Bush administration. These guys who came to power, who rule by power, can only be removed by power. This is Machiavelli's power game. That's how it is. This is how geopolitics the war games, power games work. I know inside out how it works, because I come from a family of politicians for the last 60 years. Look, I have access to the top classified information from the CIA from all over the world.
       </p>
       <p>
        They call me, I advise them. I know exactly what's going on. And this will happen. This Bashar Al Assad Emil Lahoud regime is going to go whether it's true or not. When we went to Iraq whether there were weapons of mass destruction or not, the key is we won. And Saddam is out! Whatever we want, will happen. Iran? We will not let Iran become a nuclear power. We'll find a way; we'll find an excuse to get rid of Iran. And I don't care what the excuse is. There is no room for rogue states in the world. Whether we lie about it, or invent something, or we don't... I don't care. The end justifies the means.
       </p>

        What's right? Might is right, might is right. That's it. Might is right. So Saddam wanted to prove to the whole world he was strong? Well, we're stronger he's out! He's finished. And Iran's going to be finished and every single Arab regime that's like this will be finished. Because there is no room for us capitalists and multinationalists in the world to operate with regimes like this. It's all about money. And power.
       </p>
       <p>
        And wealth... and democracy has to be spread around the world. Those who want to espouse globalization are going to make a lot of money, be happy, their families will be happy. And those who aren't going to play this game are going to be crushed, whether they like it or not!"

       In the period following the Second World War, the US has engaged in covert operations and coup attempts in Syria and other Middle Eastern countries due to their support for Socialism and Russia (just as in South and Central America, Africa, and South East Asia):

       <p>
        Nearly 50 years before the war in Iraq, Britain and America sought a secretive "regime change" in another Arab country they accused of spreading terror and threatening the west's oil supplies, by planning the invasion of Syria and the assassination of leading figures....
       </p>
       <p>
        The plan called for funding of a "Free Syria Committee", and the arming of "political factions with paramilitary or other actionist capabilities" within Syria. The CIA and MI6 would instigate internal uprisings, for instance by the Druze in the south, help to free political prisoners held in the Mezze prison, and stir up the Muslim Brotherhood in Damascus.

       Do you think TPTB would have escalated if there wasn't a response they wanted? Would they keep gassing the population until there was a response?

       Don't get me wrong, I'm in no way trying to justify the strike. I've been trying to look at this from every angle and wonder if they would ramp up the massacres (if this gas attack did in fact happen) until the US intervened against Assad.

       I've wondered the same. I think Trump knew that he was put on the spot and put in a situation where he had to react to the false flag and go along with the show, or do nothing and face defeat on the world stage as people would get outraged while the media smears him for being a Russian accomplice and ultimately he's tried to removed from power.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd imagine there'd be a shitstorm in the media if he didn't react and you're might maybe some accident or attack would follow again causing even a bigger uproar. It seems he'd either have to expose the whole plot and declare some sort of civil war to avoid being stripped and thrown in the looney bin or go along with deep state's plan while slowly exposing it. I'm just surprised they haven't assassinated him yet if they know he's still being rebellious.

       there will always be other groups wanting to overthrow any dictator, and the ONLY way said dictator is likely to keep his 'job' beyond the short term is to deal ruthlessly with his opponents

       It seems like the word "evil" is being used way more than I've ever noticed before. I starting noticing it yesterday while reading the worldnews and news posts about the US bombing Syria, and it seemed like every few comments people were calling Assad evil.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm sure the people who believe Assad actually used chemical weapons would probably view him as evil, but it just seems like it's being said a weirdly abnormal amount. Enough for me to notice anyway.
      </p>
      <p>
       I wouldn't be surprised if it's just my paranoia and I'm the only one who thinks it's strange, but it almost seems like a deliberate attempt to associate Assad with the word evil specifically.

       I always like the media's repeated insistence that it's a "Civil War" in Syria, when the reality is that the so-called "moderate rebels" [also known as ISIS terrorists] are mercenaries from Yemen, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Dubai, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not a single one of them is Syrian.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know about your dictionary, but in mine "Getting invaded by foreign soldiers" is not the definition of "Civil War".
      </p>
      <p>
       To say nothing of the official outside foreign powers in their sovereign territory, like the United States, Britain, NATO and Russia all tangling with each other in the nation.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's like the United States in 1865 getting invaded by Brazilians, Italians, Chinese and Nigerians and the press calling it a "Civil War".
      </p>
      <p>
       Sorry, but in
       <em>
        our
       </em>
       Civil War, it was our own citizens fighting against other factions of people from the same country.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Union wasn't made up of Americans while the Confederacy was made up of Swiss, Canadian, Mexican and Danish forces.
      </p>
      <p>
       What we're watching in Syria is a straight up invasion. Not a "Civil War".
      </p>
      <p>
       And this, children, is why the media has a 6% approval rating.

      <p>
       Now that's just an outright lie. Many of the forces involved are Syrians. Even some of the defected army are still kicking around. Just because the rebels have considerable outside funding and foreign fighters does not mean they are entirely foreign.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you'd have said the rebels are 100% Sunni, there you'd be correct. That's about the only thing unifying the hundreds of factions involved however.

       I think what we've learned is that in the Middle East the only way to have a functioning secular society is with strong and brutal dictator. Look at how much better off Iraq and Libya were with Sadaam and Ghadaffi at least they were a functioning society. This whole situation is screaming Iraq 2.0.

       Assad is frankly a moderate, he's secular, protects the Alawites, Christians, and other minorities, and is the only thing keeping Syria from falling into the hands of the radical Sunni terrorists like ISIS and Al Qaeda.
      </p>
      <p>
       So - of course - the US has to oppose him because Israel wants to ethnically cleanse Palestine and "resettle" them to Syria.

       We'd be far better off as allies with Syria than "allies" with the apartheid regime of Jew bigotry in Zionist-occupied Palestine.

       You are literally pushing the narrative of terrorists. Stop it. Support the legally and democratically elected leader of Syria and stop falling for the same boogeyman tail that ruined Iraq, Afghanistan, Yemen, Libya, Ukraine, and a dozen other countries.

       Once again, people are taking the lesser evil and calling him a good guy. A lesser evil is still evil.
      </p>
      <p>
       Assad is corrupt. The people around him are corrupt. As long as you accept that corruption and don't make any noise, no one will bother you. So in essence, he is no different from any other leader in the Middle East, Africa, Asia with the exception of maybe Gaddhafi. Just pray that circumstances don't put you in a position of conflict because that's when you find out how bad it is. It is wiser to pack your bags and leave.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is wrong to call Assad a good guy. It is also wrong to call Putin a good guy. Russia is also full of corruption. There's a reason Russians have dashcams - to catch scammers looking for insurance money and cops asking for bribes. If a leader can't stop bribery and corruption in 10 years of power, then the problem starts at the top. Just look at Turkey - Erdogan came into power and killed corruption and bribery overnight. There's still high level stuff going on for sure, but the average guy on the street doesn't see it. Say what you might about the guy and his recent actions, but his people love him for what he did 15 years ago.
      </p>
      <p>
       Assad has a CID, comparable to I guess the FBI or secret service. They call it Mukhabarat. Their primary role is to find dissidents and make them disappear. They're not too far off from the intelligence services of Iran during the Shah regime, pre-revolution. Very pro-active, very powerful and you can't touch them.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am not pro-war in Syria. I am also not Pro-Russia, Pro-ISIS, Pro-US, Pro-Assad either. Syria is a battleground of multiple actors and they are all evil with innocent civilians getting killed in the middle.

       Who said "only?" Everyone knows that Sunni terrorists, ISIS, Al Qaeda, Saudi despots, and the like have been demonizing Syria - but no one is intimidated into not mentioning them.

       Every time I listen to a news clip, I hear about how evil Assad is. Yet when Assad is interviewed in person, he doesn't seem evil, he seems like a cultured, educated human being. I don't see anything "evil" about him at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       The same was true of the Shah of Iran. They used to call him evil, but when he was interviewed he came across as a personable, highly intelligent man who was trying to do his best for his nation.

       I hate these threads. Always written by someone how has just started researching the Syrian conflict.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hey son Assad was allowing his own troops shoot and murder unarmed protestors long before the "conflict" even started.
