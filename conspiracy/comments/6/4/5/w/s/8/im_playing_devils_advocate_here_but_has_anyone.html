      <p>
       Been skimming over all the coverage and a scenario from a movie popped into my head.
      </p>
      <p>
       The movie is
       <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0164184/?ref_=nm_flmg_act_30">
        The Sum of All Fears
       </a>
       ...and the scenario that came to mind was when the Russian President took credit for the chemical attack, even though he didn't order it, because he didn't want to look like he was weak and didn't have control of his military.
      </p>
      <p>
       For anyone who's seen the movie, its basically
       <a href="https://youtu.be/PJpGMrH7RWs">
        this scene
       </a>
       followed by a scene where the Russian president takes credit for it on TV, making our protagonist (ben affleks character, Jack Ryan) look foolish, and then cuts to a scene of the Russian president in the elevator after the press conference, asking his aid which of his generals defied him and attacked without authorization....
      </p>
      <p>
       SO...what if "the swamp" simply went over Trumps head and did what they wanted to do without his consent? I mean, assuming Trump was legit, and not just another NWO plant, what power would he really have? If he wouldn't play ball, would it be beyond the shadow governments power to do something like this? And if they could/would do it, what would Trump do? Motive, and opportunity seem to be there for TPTB, where as this strike, and more importantly his admitting to it, has driven a pretty big wedge between Trump and his base.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like i said....devil's advocate, hes probably just a willing puppet, but it's worth considering imo.

       But Trump did order the strike...
      </p>
      <p>
       Did he admit to this supposed
       <em>
        swamp
       </em>
       going over his head and committing these actions? Or did he simply let it happen and move along?

       That's sort of my point...his admittance isn't proof that he did. People admit to things they didn't do all the time for a multitude of reasons.

       No he didn't, but that doesnt mean that they didn't go over his head. And maybe he didnt have the power to stop them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, devils advocate, but I think its worth considering just how entrenched the shadow government is. Assuming Trump is legit, and genuinely wants to "drain the swamp", how much power would he really have to do so if the "swamp" was so big? Normally I would just say TPTB would have him killed, but his assassination would cause quite the shitstorm in the US....and the population is still armed to the teeth. Maybe its just easier in this case to make him look bad to his supporters?

       Id like to think that if it was me, i would simply tell everyone the truth, but I have never been under that kind of pressure. Assuming for a second that he didn't make the call to strike, maybe he cracked under the pressure of realizing just how not in control he really is.

       Don't assume to know what I understand or not. We aren't talking about me here. And I understand that not everyone shares the same opinion of what is good and what is evil. Though i do subscribe to the opinion that there is a clear definition of what good and what evil is...though that judgment belongs to God....

       But again, this is all just bad speculation. Donald Trump has said time and time again he is down with Israel and it's idea to form
       <em>
        Greater Israel
       </em>
       . Since Obama gave Syria to Russia by not interfering, the only way to get that done is to go to war with Russia.

       All those people are dead and gone. I think you misinterpret the meaning. "Israel" are those of us who accept Jesus Christ...whether from the past present or future. Not some modern country in the middle east, and certainly not a people or individuals who don't accept Jesus as the messiah.

       Which is why John spoke of the messiah coming back to destroy those who destroy the earth.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Revelation 11:18King James Version (KJV)

       <p>
        18 And the nations were angry, and thy wrath is come, and the time of the dead, that they should be judged, and that thou shouldest give reward unto thy servants the prophets, and to the saints, and them that fear thy name, small and great; and shouldest destroy them which destroy the earth.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Esau is the twin brother of Jacob who sold his birthright to Jacob for a morsel of meat. He was the first one born red which means his blood showed forth through his skin.  A master hunter who loved to conquer animals.
      </p>
      <p>
       Esau means wasted away is he and he is the base of man, the pure carnal of the flesh.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edom means Red, do you understand why they named themselves Red Shield or Rothschild?
      </p>
      <p>
       Rothschild is Edom, this is why they enslaved the true Hebrews 500 years ago, why they create all these wars and perform these satanic rituals while claiming to be the real Jews. It's because they know they are damned by God.

       How do you not know by now it doesn't matter who is in the presidents position they are merely a public face they have no real power they do as they are told. I bet you're praying for ww3 aren't you. I bet each time you think of it you get slightly aroused then Punish yourself for such sins but secretly you want it. Oh the fear to be spread, the power to be had. You'd make a good politician mate.

       Don't make me laugh, man's own greed and lust for power is what brings the prophecies about. Why would I pray for something that the father as already promised is coming?

       Are you joking? Trump is constantly changing his position. He changes his position to make himself look good and completely denies holding his previous positions even when presented with direct evidence in the form of his own words. The man has zero integrity.

       Yes, and the problem is, if the deep state made this happen on their own, Trump has to take credit, because admitting he is in control of the military presents a bigger problem (can you imagion a bigger problem then the possible start of WW3).
