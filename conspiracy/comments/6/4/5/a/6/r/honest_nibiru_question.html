       In all honestly, how likely is it that Nibiru exists, and is actually on a near collision course with earth.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've heard about it for the last fews years and it periodically picks up steam and then falls off the face of the earth again. I personally don't see how something supposedly so close is not visible. (Though it has missed it's arrival date several times now) This whole thing seems a little to out there for me. The only argument I've seen is that chemicals and smog are blocking it from being seen, which sounds like utter nonesense when I can walk out at night and take a pristine picture of the milky eay galaxy.
      </p>
      <p>
       I for one, welcome back our annunaki overlords.
      </p>
      <p>
       In all seriousness though, any thoughts or ideas in the topic are welcome.

       Oh no, I'm pretty sure all Flat earthers are serious.
I'm not fully convinced but flat Earth is something else if you really look into it...
You can make so many connections to a lot of things with the flat Earth theory.

       I can't honestly believe it. Gravity makes no sense with flat earth. Nor does the rotation of stars or orbiting satellites. I'll look into it eventually out of curiosity, but its real easy to connect things when you throw out the rules used to normally connect things.

His flat Earth theory videos is what got me looking into conspiracy theories in the first place.
I can fell free to link a few videos if you'd like.

       Honest to god who knows man.
Maybe The Flat Earth Theory is just another distraction to keep us from looking at the bigger picture.
Maybe it's to keep us from believing Nibiru is really coming. It's all very confusing and who knows if will ever get the answers to our questions.

       IDK, man. There is some pretty fucky stuff going on in the skies of Alaska. I think planet X may be in a different dimension. It possibly can weave in and out, for what ever reason(s). Pretty trippy shit... They are hiding stuff. Plenty of people are talking about it with video proof...

       I totally agree with unexplained stuff. Just not sure about this. Seems a little to big a thing to be made up, but also there is no concrete evidence really. I really don't trust any video evidence unless I or someone I know took it. Video editing is way too good these days.

       True, always be skeptical. Come up here to Alaska and see for yourself :). Something is fucky.... FE? Probably not. Entertained it, too many holes. Concave or Hollow? Maybe... Something is up, and they are lying...

       I could even believe hollow to an extent. It's not like as a man of faith I don't believe seemingly strange things already. I mean billions of people believe in God, a being outside of our universe, who created it and us. If you cam readily believe that, hoe crazy is the earth being shaped different from what you think.

       I used to be a Catholic, so you have a someone who can relate. I'm no longer. The most interesting thing in this whole FE, CE, HE thing is how all major scientists/mathematicians/physicists/etc etc are all apart of secret societies, the occult, esoteric, and ancient majick/mystery schools. Truly, no one has the fuckin' answers...

       I'm not sure why you're being downvoted, this is interesting stuff. I truly feel like something is being hidden from us using chemtrails. It's hard to explain but everything has felt off lately. The skies where I live usually have a strange white hue to them now, I rarely see blue skies anymore!

       Look into this and things start making more sense. Nibiru hunters would be wise to entertain this also.

       Even if Nibiru exists, it passes through the asteroid zone (between Mars and Jupiter), not close enough to hit earth. Nibiru could potentially disloge an asteroid off the zone towards earth, but that's actually kinda manageable with todays tech.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is also possible that the asteroid zone
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       (was?) Nibiru.

       Very unlikely. The science does not add up. Surely, there could be another planet, but nothing like the mass extinction and shit that's speculated with Nibiru. Try not to dwell too deep into conspiracy, that's where you'll find bullshit.

       This is the type of stuff that should be in conspiracy. I've been following the whole nibiru thing for a while now. A lot of stuff kept getting repeated that it would all happen in 2015 but thats untrue. It was only a speculation that at that point it would be close enough to start causing problems on earth, only the fear mongers have said that it will hit earth. I don't think that's the case. NASA have had to admit that we now have a binary twin and admitted exactly how many planets and satellites were in that system but gave stupid figures as to it's distance. Monitors and sensors all around the word are going crazy and the earth is ripping herself apart, a lot of people have had the programming veil lifted and are starting to see the world for what it is and I don't think it's all coincidence. The air is tense and something is about to happen, the government's will cover it with war when it starts. We just need everyone to keep calm and work together when/if something happens. It's our only way to turn the earth and mankind back on track and defeat greed

       Do you take the whole Nibiru thing the extra step that some people do, saying there is an advanced civilization from the Nibiru system that has visited earth before? Just curious to gauge what people think of that.

       I don't really know to be honest. I've just been focusing on the solar side of things. Keeping an eye on orbits and if anything is visable from our view from earth. I do think thou that it's more than likely there is advanced civilizations out there and are properly not allowed to interact with us legally due to our behaviours down here. Id imagine they would have some really complex galactic laws just like ours if they did exist. I would like to hope this is the turning point in humanity where we proved our while by throwing our system out and becoming more of a united one with fair equal laws and thrive.

       Who knows, if there is anyone or anything out there. Its like nothing we've ever seen. So it very well might not act in any way we would expect.

       What I'm curious about is all the videos and photos of OBVIOUS extra celestial objects in the sky, that are NOT the sun or moon.

       I don't doubt there are unexplained things. Whether other beings or top secret projects. I would never believe a picture or video of a ufo though. Check out CaptainDisillusion on youtube. He debunks that kinda stuff and shows how easy it is to make it seem real. It helps that he has had a career in video editing and stuff too.
