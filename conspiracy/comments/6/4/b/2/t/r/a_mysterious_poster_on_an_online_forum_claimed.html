        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>In 2007-2008, a mysterious poster on an online forum claimed that Jared Kushner was the head of a secret society which would assume control after the next president (after Obama). Most users thought that it was a larper but they still dug up a lot of interesting information on Kushner.</p>

<p>Today the prediction hits eerily close to home.</p>

<p>Another noteworthy aspect is that back then Kushner was only in his mid-twenties and nobody knew who he was yet, so it would have been really strange for someone to elaborately larp about him.</p>

<p>All of the OP&#39;s stuff is gone except for what others quoted. They did some interesting research based on what he said, but my BS meter is pinging, so I&#39;m leaning towards random bizarro larp (the stuff about Ivanka is weird). </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>OK, so here is another main thing:</p>

<p>Jared Kushner is not The Head of the Illuminati. However all the things I have said so far are true, and he sort of has a similar background to the real Head.</p>

<p>Kushner is some guy who has ended up crawling into three of our primary parameters, as he purchased 666 5th Avenue which is a building we need and he got engaged to Ivanka Trump who is the girl we need. He also has enough incidental similarities to the head that I can describe the Head of the Illuminati in a way that people will assume I am describing Kushner, but it&#39;s not him.</p>

<p>So Rupert Murdoch is kind of like the guy monitoring the situation and we are going to do a big build up where the Head of the Illuminati smashes Kushner the fuck down, and Kushner is kind of like a fall guy to build up the Chief&#39;s power by making a big deal of how he kicked the ass of this rich kid handsome billionaire and stole his girlfriend.</p>

<p>The real head who I work for is someone who no one has ever heard of and he&#39;s incredibly, incredibly bizarre. He is in some stuff on the internet, but it&#39;s really strange shit.</p>

<p>So for example, the real head is also a boy genius who is from New Jersey and is Jewish and went to Harvard, but he is very eccentric, like sometimes he dresses like this:</p>

<p><a href="http://usuarios.lycos.es/varyfat/ff6kefka.jpg">http://usuarios.lycos.es/varyfat/ff6kefka.jpg</a></p>

<p>To explain things, I use Kushner as a proxy place holder since most people would assume the Head of the Illuminati would be some kind of well put together society man.</p>

<p>He&#39;s not at all though.</p>

<p>He&#39;s a complete freak of nature.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This dude says outright that Kushner is not the head of the illuminati... in fact he said that Kushner will be crushed - he&#39;ll be the fall guy to help build power for the real leader. Here&#39;s exactly what he says: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Jared Kushner is not The Head of the Illuminati. However all the things I have said so far are true, and he sort of has a similar background to the real Head.</p>

<p>Kushner is some guy who has ended up crawling into three of our primary parameters, as he purchased 666 5th Avenue which is a building we need and he got engaged to Ivanka Trump who is the girl we need. He also has enough incidental similarities to the head that I can describe the Head of the Illuminati in a way that people will assume I am describing Kushner, but it&#39;s not him.</p>

<p>So Rupert Murdoch is kind of like the guy monitoring the situation and we are going to do a big build up where the Head of the Illuminati smashes Kushner the fuck down, and Kushner is kind of like a fall guy to build up the Chief&#39;s power by making a big deal of how he kicked the ass of this rich kid handsome billionaire and stole his girlfriend.</p>

<p>The part that doesn&#39;t sync up is that he says that the &quot;leader&quot; isn&#39;t in the public view, which is very obviously NOT Milo, who was a media whore from the start (and I say that kindly, I don&#39;t like the guy but he played the media like a pro until the end and I won&#39;t be surprised if he comes back into the spotlight after his scandal blows over). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;OK, so here is another main thing:</p>

<p>Jared Kushner is not The Head of the Illuminati. However all the things I have said so far are true, and he sort of has a similar background to the real Head.</p>

<p>Kushner is some guy who has ended up crawling into three of our primary parameters, as he purchased 666 5th Avenue which is a building we need and he got engaged to Ivanka Trump who is the girl we need. He also has enough incidental similarities to the head that I can describe the Head of the Illuminati in a way that people will assume I am describing Kushner, but it&#39;s not him.</p>

<p>So Rupert Murdoch is kind of like the guy monitoring the situation and we are going to do a big build up where the Head of the Illuminati smashes Kushner the fuck down, and Kushner is kind of like a fall guy to build up the Chief&#39;s power by making a big deal of how he kicked the ass of this rich kid handsome billionaire and stole his girlfriend.</p>

<p>The real head who I work for is someone who no one has ever heard of and he&#39;s incredibly, incredibly bizarre. He is in some stuff on the internet, but it&#39;s really strange shit.</p>

<p>So for example, the real head is also a boy genius who is from New Jersey and is Jewish and went to Harvard, but he is very eccentric, like sometimes he dresses like this:</p>

<p><a href="http://usuarios.lycos.es/varyfat/ff6kefka.jpg">http://usuarios.lycos.es/varyfat/ff6kefka.jpg</a></p>

<p>To explain things, I use Kushner as a proxy place holder since most people would assume the Head of the Illuminati would be some kind of well put together society man.</p>

<p>He&#39;s not at all though.</p>

<p>He&#39;s a complete freak of nature.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is also an interesting prediction:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The head of the Virgin Group, Richard Branson, who is one of the highest ranking Illuminati, also created a group called The Elders, a series of 12 Wise Political Leaders led by Nelson Mandela and Desmond Tutu and also including former President Jimmy Carter.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Elders are a very key central part of the mythology of Project Blue Beam, and currently the <strong>12th Elder is a Nobel Peace Prize Winner named Aung Sun Suu Kyi</strong> who is a political prisoner in the Southeast Asian Nation of Myanmar which is ruled by a brutal military junta that slaughters Buddhist Monks.</p>

<p>How they are planning on introducing the Main Guy to the world is he is supposed to sort of come out of nowhere and topple the dictator of Myanmar to restore justice to the country, <strong>rescuing and restoring the 12th Elder to power</strong>, and the whole thing will begin to create the mythology of Blue Beam with him being this kind of like amazing world hero who defeats an oppressive regime and add mythos to these 12 Elders and the guy who created them who is Richard Branson.</p>

<p>If something like this happens, that is how you know it is Project Blue Beam, because that&#39;s how it is supposed to start.</p>

<p>Aung Sun Suu Kyi is currently the State Counsellor of Myanmar, similar to a Prime Minister, or head of the Government as there was a clause that she could not become President. She came into this position in 2016.</p>

I have a tough time believing that if Jared Kushner were &quot;head of the illuminati&quot; (or of any significant secret society), that his father would have spent 2 years locked up (14 months of which was in a federal prison)  just a few years  before. </p>

<p>I mean, we see regular politicians and wealthy individuals who, in broad daylight,  pull strings to not only avoid jail time for themselves or their friends, but to avoid even worrying about having to get caught in the first place. I just have a tough time believing that the father of the head of a significant secret society (if it exists) would be forced to spend that that kind of time in federal prison. I mean, if you can&#39;t pull strings to get someone out of a charge for illegal campaign contributions (or trying to blackmail their brother-in-law), then what the hell is so great about being in a secret society anyways? </p>

<p>He got out of Prison in 2006, and went back to his previous position.
Haven&#39;t heard anything else about him as far as I know.</p>

<p>But that is all my opinion :)  Just the way I could see that happening.</p>

<p>Also, it said he had a lot of charges against him. some to do with taxes too. So Maybe they DID help him, by making sure he didn&#39;t get the whole book thrown at him. But he still needed to be &quot;taught a lesson&quot; kind of thing. </p>

<p>Donald Trump (as well as all his family members) is NOT a member of the Illuminati</p>

<p>No one is a member of &quot;The Illuminati&quot; in the sense of being a member of a secret society going back to the Bavarian Illuminati formed in 1776 and disbanded in the 1780s.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a way to confuse people into thinking there&#39;s some small secret council, when it&#39;s really a few thousand people in things like the Council on Foreign Relations, Bilderberg, Trilateral Comission, Heritage, Cato, the Council for National Policy, Pilgrim&#39;s Society, Le Circle, the Knights of Malta, high level freemasonry, general staff of the military, heads of large corporations, business roundtable, heads of intelligence agencies, and elite academics at institutions like Harvard, Yale, etc.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok. But that&#39;s not a meaningful statement. The idea that people like the John Birch society push that there is an &quot;Illuminati&quot; running the world based on a short-lived group in the 1780s is demonstrably false.</p>

<p>The world is not that well-organized, and they are not called the Illuminati.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I use &quot;illuminati&quot; to quickly refer to that superstructure. You can quickly move through a lot of analysis with a good shorthand. In the end it doesn&#39;t matter if there is a secret sect or not, what matters is the fight against the hydra. (My favourite shorthand).</p>

<p>But in the end, those at the top DO believe themselves illumonated and thus better than the rest of the population. And if you cut off a head, something else will regrow and take up its mantle without missing a beat. Like the hydra.</p>

<p>But yeah. To take it doewn we need to join forces from r/conservative to r/completeanarchy</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Illuminati was a very real revolutionary think-tank founded in 1776. Allegedly, high ranking intellectuals and world leaders are apart of the evolved descendant of the Illuminati and they work together covertly to guide world events to their benefit and ideological bent.

<p>There is a precedent. The Illuminati were involved in the American and French revolution. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I absolutely believe that there is a secret society that manipulates world events and it&#39;s called the freemasons. And above the freemasons you have the kabbalah elite and that&#39;s who I&#39;d usually refer to as Illuminati.</p>

<p>I say <em>I believe</em> the freemasons manipulate world because there is ample evidence, but not conclusive proof. I say the kabbalists control the freemasons because they absolutely do, and there is proof. It&#39;s as simple as reading their literature, which- I&#39;d wager- most average freemasons never get around to doing. Kind of like how most Christians never actually read the entire bible. </p>

<p>Anyway, as I said about freemasonry being under kabbalah:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Some writers have imagined that the parallel lines represent the Tropics of Cancer and Capricorn, which the Sun alternately touches upon at the Summer and Winter solstices. But the tropics are not perpendicular lines, and the idea is merely fanciful. If the parallel lines ever belonged to the ancient symbol, they had some more recondite and more fruitful meaning. They probably had the same meaning as the twin columns Jachin and Boaz. <strong>That meaning is not for the Apprentice. The adept may find it in the Kabalah.</strong></p>

<p>i&#39;m surprised to hear that my atheism would disbar me from joining. I always thought they&#39;d be more tolerant of agnosticism or things that were further away from religious fundamentalism. what should it tell me that they don&#39;t accept atheists?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Founder of Mormons was a freemason and most of the symbolism of Mormons is taken directly from freemasonry. Much the stuff that goes on in Mormon temples is freemasonic ritual. I can also tell you that the Mormon leadership is directly involved with the government-
probably through a masonic connection- in ways that are hidden but to what extent and what capacity I only have guesses. </p>

<p>Well I don&#39;t know what it should tell you but I can tell you that what it tells me is that there&#39;s more to freemasons than &quot;community service.&quot; Because if it was just about community service, and if- as they claim- it&#39;s not a religious thing and if they take people of all religions- then it doesn&#39;t really make sense to disqualify atheists. </p>

<p>The implications past that, is uncertain territory for me. It gets complicated, and I&#39;ve only read Morals and Dogma. I&#39;d have to read other material to feel more certain but it&#39;s all very tedious. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because I know enough about Mormons to know what they are and are not allowed to do. </p>

<p>You know how you brought up the Catholic scandals in the other thread? How there&#39;s a sort of, hmm, compartmentalization that keeps the majority of knowing what is going on behind the scenes? They&#39;re told one thing, meanwhile something else is really going on.
 Well, based on what the average Mormon is taught, this right here:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.moneyteachers.org/images/paste94.jpg">http://www.moneyteachers.org/images/paste94.jpg</a></p>

<p>and this right here:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.rogerknecht.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Romney-and-McCain.jpg">http://www.rogerknecht.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Romney-and-McCain.jpg</a></p>

<p>would get those men condemned to Hell (or the Mormon version of it). Those handshakes, what they call &quot;tokens.&quot; They&#39;re not allowed to do it outside of their temples, and definitely not with non-Mormons. First one is the current leader of the Mormons, the second one is Mitt Romney who is a very powerful and influential Mormon (second cousin of my grandfather). </p>

<p>There is zero justification in them doing so by Mormon doctrine. So there has to be an explanation outside of what the Mormons are taught. </p>

<p>Yes, finding the truth is a bitch. I&#39;ve given up on a lot of answers I used to search for. I have things I&#39;m reasonably certain about but that&#39;s it. </p>

<p>Anyway, here&#39;s a video you might find interesting:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBK5aKOr2Fw">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBK5aKOr2Fw</a></p>

<p>My background beyond the Mormons is that one my aunts left the Mormon cult for an even more radical (more classical type) cult. I&#39;ve had some interactions with their leader: </p>

<p><a href="http://christophernemelka.com/">http://christophernemelka.com/</a></p>

<p>a legit psychopath who has convinced all his followers that he&#39;s basically the third reincarnation of Jesus and used it to control them. Pimped out his ex wife for money. Total scumbag. Told me that I&#39;m the reason for all the worlds ills lol. So anyway, I&#39;ve had experience with cults and the reason I share all that is because from my perspective, I see a lot of connections between masons and cults. Not saying they are a cult, but there are common themes. And as that video explains, cults tend to keep their skeletons in the closet, well hidden from outside view.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>At first I was like, oh all this is pretty interesting. Then:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As of October 2008, Kushner was engaged to Ivanka Trump, who was in the midst of her preparations to convert to Judaism before the wedding.[5]
Kushner is an Orthodox Jew.[6]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>uhmmm. OK. Yeah.  </p>

<p>Then I get to page 2. And the thread derails and in to Project Blue Beam. Then 3 and 4 further degenerate. The final post though:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The name Illuminati does not come from meaning that they claim to be &quot;the enlightened ones,&quot; rather, their name is so, because they are from &quot;The Planet of Light,&quot; where they live in a multi-dimensional existence. &quot;The Planet of Light,&quot; is the home planet of the Illuminati, and is part of a planetary Star System comprising some 30,000 Illuminati governed/inhabited planets.</p>

<p>I say <em>I believe</em> the freemasons manipulate world because there is ample evidence, but not conclusive proof. I say the kabbalists control the freemasons because they absolutely do, and there is proof.

    <div class="md"><p>Because I know enough about Mormons to know what they are and are not allowed to do. </p>

<p>You know how you brought up the Catholic scandals in the other thread? How there&#39;s a sort of, hmm, compartmentalization that keeps the majority of knowing what is going on behind the scenes? They&#39;re told one thing, meanwhile something else is really going on.
 Well, based on what the average Mormon is taught, this right here:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.moneyteachers.org/images/paste94.jpg">http://www.moneyteachers.org/images/paste94.jpg</a></p>

<p>and this right here:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.rogerknecht.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Romney-and-McCain.jpg">http://www.rogerknecht.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Romney-and-McCain.jpg</a></p>

<p>would get those men condemned to Hell (or the Mormon version of it). Those handshakes, what they call &quot;tokens.&quot; They&#39;re not allowed to do it outside of their temples, and definitely not with non-Mormons. First one is the current leader of the Mormons, the second one is Mitt Romney who is a very powerful and influential Mormon (second cousin of my grandfather). </p>

<p>There is zero justification in them doing so by Mormon doctrine. So there has to be an explanation outside of what the Mormons are taught. </p>

<p>Yes, finding the truth is a bitch. I&#39;ve given up on a lot of answers I used to search for. I have things I&#39;m reasonably certain about but that&#39;s it. </p>

<p>Anyway, here&#39;s a video you might find interesting:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBK5aKOr2Fw">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBK5aKOr2Fw</a></p>

<p>My background beyond the Mormons is that one my aunts left the Mormon cult for an even more radical (more classical type) cult. I&#39;ve had some interactions with their leader: </p>

<p><a href="http://christophernemelka.com/">http://christophernemelka.com/</a></p>

<p>a legit psychopath who has convinced all his followers that he&#39;s basically the third reincarnation of Jesus and used it to control them. Pimped out his ex wife for money. Total scumbag. Told me that I&#39;m the reason for all the worlds ills lol. So anyway, I&#39;ve had experience with cults and the reason I share all that is because from my perspective, I see a lot of connections between masons and cults. Not saying they are a cult, but there are common themes. And as that video explains, cults tend to keep their skeletons in the closet, well hidden from outside view.</p>
