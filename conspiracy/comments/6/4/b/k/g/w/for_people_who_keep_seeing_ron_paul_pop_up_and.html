       So, you may be asking yourself, "Self, who is this Ron Paul guy? And why did the media recently run his anti-war anti-surveillance anti-debt son's name through the dirt over a joke of an internet bill? Didn't Rand Paul just sell out our privacy rights away?"
      </p>
      <p>
       No.
      </p>
      <p>
       It all began long ago when it became very clear that after George W. Bush had arguably destroyed the country worse than any president before him, that a large liberty movement was rising... from the right.
      </p>
      <p>
       After war and debt and big government, a grass roots campaign rallied behind Ron Paul. 2008. These people were radical. Wanting to end the federal reserve and slash military funding. Bring troops home from every even the benign countries. Close bases. Pull out of NATO.
      </p>
      <p>
       These were also your early internet trolls. Memes and brigading of internet polls. His rallies were huge. It was all very real.
      </p>
      <p>
       But in 2008 they sold us John McCain as a "moderate Republican who could get a long with democrats". Do you see what the hell is happening now with that guy? War hungry af wtf.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, here are the links:

      <p>
       Very big on ending the Federal Reserve. Ending the wars. He is a former Libertarian presidential nominee as well. End the drugs war. End the wars. No dept of Education. Cut spending. Barely any taxes. No Federal reserve. No surveillance. Essentially, no gov't. All individual liberty. Small government. Wasn't hard for him to run as a limited government republican. George W. Bush just got done expanding government like we had never seen before. Ron Paul ran against all that and had a ton of momentum, but was pushed to the side.
      </p>
      <p>
       They even change the rules so that he couldn't win at the convention. They feared how intense his grass roots campaign was, so they change the rules where delegates couldn't change at the convention.
      </p>
      <p>
       Guess who got the republican nomination in 2008? John fucking McCain.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ron Paul got one electoral vote in 2016 when one person defected from Texas and voted for him. God bless.
      </p>

       Here is one of his most famous and moving speeches from 2009:

       An oh, yeah, and how could I forget. They smeared him as a racist, too.
      </p>
      <p>
       His son is Senator Rand Paul from Kentucky. Ron Paul was in the House of Representatives from Texas. Both are doctors.

       After watching the media blackout video you posted (which is very good) I had a few thoughts. Firstly it's fucking terrible that a country's media can run a coordinated ignoring of a candidate like that. It shows right there that the media is controlled by a few elite who promote war.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, I feel that Trumps campaign tried to tap into Paul's voter base with the rhetoric that he's an anti-government outsider - but this time with the approval of the elite.
      </p>
      <p>
       What's horrifying, is that the conversation Trump is having is about whether to have only US troops or have a coalition. Where is the voice of not putting in any troops? Nowhere. Because the elite need war.
      </p>
      <p>
       America was once a great nation. The current behaviours are of a nation in an uncontrollable downward spiral.
      </p>
      <p>
       Paul might have been able to turn it around in 2008, but I doubt anyone can turn it around now.
