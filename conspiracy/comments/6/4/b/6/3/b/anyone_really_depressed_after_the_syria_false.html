<p>The only ones who would use their support of Trump in this against them are themselves.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, they know how to deal with &quot;warmongering&quot; Republicans, and all they really need to perpetuate the myth that Trump and his supporters are rabid warmongers is a few soundbites. That&#39;s what their &quot;support&quot; is aimed at achieving.</p>

You need to take a break from the media, media is not reality, it&#39;s shit they shove down your throats to distract you from doing anything worth a fuck for yourself , reality is going outside ,interacting with people not on the internet, going to work , interaction with the opposite sex , hobbies , family time , friends time (if you have them) life you live , reality is not what the media is feeding you , that&#39;s a sales pitch to make you buy into something that has nothing to do with you .</p>

<p>What I want is a source which propagates, the truth. However when money is involved, the truth suffers. This is a big problem in a capitalism, for instance,  where I can pay for segments of the truth forever and still never make it through the entire maze, due to time constraints.</p>

<p>If I could just, happen upon a temple where a single man could just tell me, all I need to know, that would be nice. If that man also had eyes and ears all over the planet, so that we could keep up on all that were relevant, that would be nice. It seems that is impossible, and so perhaps we may only have one of the two things we seek. We may know everything, or we may understand everything (that we know), but we cannot have both simultaneously ;)</p>

<p>All propaganda is bad because it appeals to you on an emotional level and attempts to bypass your reason and judgment. Whatever the aims of the propaganda, it manipulates you, and that makes it bad.</p>

<p>Rather than judging an action by that metric, I prefer to judge it based on the intention of the actor. I believe this single category takes into account that every action, and the effect of every action may have both a good and bad nature simultaneously.</p>

Anymore the news is pretty much entertainment , politics is like a soap opera ,people love entertainment in the form of other people&#39;s suffering and misery , it gives them a sense of they are doing better than the ones suffering , but to be depressed about some news from msm ( because the shit is faked for ratings and revenue) is taking things to a whole new petty level ,that is attention seeking SJW behavior for validation of generic feelings in the form of likes and karma points </p>

<p>However, there is a way to separate oneself from the emotional aspects, long enough to sort out which emotions are necessary. Some measure of emotion, is usually necessary, but the trick is to get it just right.</p>

<p>Control of self is the only control possible. Good thing that is all that is required.</p>

How you spend your time? Even if you are absorbing information you only cannot defeat the system, it takes everyone because thats where the power comes from. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you are going through emotional turnmoil from these events I believe its best to withdrawal yourself and focus on correcting how you precieve the information instead of simple attaching raw emotion to it. Fear changes the perspective of the information you recieve, if its too hard to handle, you can first start with helping yourself and the people close to you.</p>

<p>At the end of the day its our family and friends who you will have the most leverage in communicating with and changing perspective. I&#39;m in no way advocating a wishy washy approach, I simple believe if big/outside events are creating so much fear you should first start with yourself and the people close to you. 
It angers me that the media has more leverage than me when it comes to people so close to me. Just small subjects such as health takes a lot of effort into correcting despite them being my family and friends. Global events are important but we should also focus on ourselves and places where you know you can make a difference.</p>

<p>What you are describing is media influence and not true reality. </p>

<p>Reality, unless you are in a region near the conflict has almost no connection to this conflict. I am not saying you should ignore the impacts of the conflict as those are very real, but try and put them in a real world perspective.</p>

<p>Take a break from media for a few days and you will see reality is a little less backwards.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Power of the Powerless is an expansive political essay written in October 1978 by the Czech dramatist, political dissident and later politician, Václav Havel. The essay dissects the nature of the communist regime of the time, life within such a regime and how by their very nature such regimes can create dissidents of ordinary citizens. The essay goes on to discuss ideas and possible actions by loose communities of individuals linked by a common cause, such as Charter 77. Officially suppressed, the essay was circulated in samizdat form and translated into multiple languages. It became a manifesto for dissent in Czechoslovakia, Poland and other communist regimes.</p>

<p>It really wasn&#39;t clear. He said all kinds of conflicting things, including wanting to reform the intelligence agencies and opposition to war in Syria. He wasn&#39;t in any elite policy organizations, wasn&#39;t in any secret societies, etc.</p>

<p>You&#39;re thinking in very general terms, and I&#39;m referring to specific policy alternatives. The elites are not unanimous on every issue, and there are people that may push &quot;elite-approved&quot; positions that are better than other &quot;elite-approved&quot; positions. i.e. Trumps&#39; claims he would fight ISIS and not try to overthrow Assad.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>The elite aim to start WW3.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I disagree with that part of your statement. I don&#39;t think the various world-class elites want WW3, but are content to fight relatively small, proxy battles for geopolitical / economic spheres of influence and profit that can be mitigated via, e.g., the U.N. or World Bank, before any of them suffer the calamitous losses associated with a modern-day WW. I say this because the calamities associated with WWI &amp; II would pale in comparison to a WW fought with modern weapons of mass destruction. Literally no-one would profit from that, at least not for very long, I mean, unless they consider surviving a thermo-nuclear war in a sumptuous underground bunker as a winning scenario. And even if they do, they wouldn&#39;t be able to survive the wasteland waiting on them when their bunker supplies are exhausted and they have to emerge. </p>

I support Trump but him striking Syria so quickly, to me, was wrong like many others on the right believe.  But when I heard CNN and MSNBC saying stuff like Trump is now presidential for striking Syria so quickly it just confirms to me even more how phony the conspiracies against Trump the past few months have been.  All of MSM, even Fox News, is bs.  They are all pushing their agendas for The United States of America Incorporated.  The corruption on both sides is so sick right now b/c of money that they easily blind the public with their bs FAKE NEWS to keep the train moving.  Think about it, everyone talks about how corupt the gov&#39;t is with corporate money and corporate politicians but the media never does any type of investigative work on it and pushes nonsense till people are tired of it that nothing changes.  Now everyone is quick to say striking Syria was the best thing to do, even the lefty media!  Fucking bs.

    <div class="md"><p>Great username OP.</p>

<p>This is probably why Trump is going golfing all the time. He didn&#39;t understand &#39;the game&#39;. Now that he has been red-pilled and threatened, he decided to throw his hands up in the air and say, &#39;Fuck it. I&#39;m going to Mar-a-Lago.&#39;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m disappointed in Trump. I really thought he was going to stand up to the Deep State. But he caved like a deck of cards. He went for the praise of liberal assholes who were calling for his impeachment the day before. He&#39;s dead to me now. I have no hope for America, or for the West. All I can see is a gradual decline into poverty and servitude.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Many predictions of the novel 1984 have become true and yeah it&#39;s very  sad for a place so associated with freedom and pursuing your dreams to become a place where so much authoritarian crap happens, just like in all of the other places we have always been warned about and/or attacked outright with bombs from far away.   </p>

<p>But we have been taught about doublethink, Clinton explained exactly what they are doing with her secret &quot;public and private position&quot; speech.  I&#39;m sure she as a public and private position on sex, murder, stealing, bribery, fiat currency, and pretty much a lot of other dirty crap that&#39;s just what there is evidence of.  </p>

<p>Same with Trump.  In every country he does business, he does it with known mobsters.  This stuff has all been known, but people thought apparently Hillary was dirty, and maybe due to other countries doing to us what we have done to them.  </p>

<p>Most people don&#39;t know what it would have been like in the 3 states where the margins were most slim, don&#39;t think foreign intelligence agencies couldn&#39;t predict what we weren&#39;t seeing on CNN about the electoral college.   </p>

<p>It&#39;s some real matrix shit.  Some real doublethink.  Actual evidence right in front of your face of what Chomsky calls &quot;elaborate webs of deceit&quot;.  Another way to describe a web is a matrix, not apples and oranges, just apples.  </p>

<p>So why not panic!!  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86URGgqONvA&amp;amp;feature=player_embedded">OMG RUN TO THE HILLS!</a> </p>

<p>First of all: Don&#39;t Panic (this is just basic stuff from the hitchiker&#39;s guide, further study will be rewarded)</p>

<p>Second of all: Courage is the virtue that makes all the others possible</p>

<p>At some point you have to choose to be courageous, or not.  I think it&#39;s better to be courageous even if it means idk standing up for yourself, getting fired if you won&#39;t put up with being demeaned, speaking your mind when it&#39;s going to affect your paycheck or status, going to a protest or a lot of protests, being willing to get arrested in order to make a statement.   History has lots of examples of people standing up for themselves with widely varying, sometimes horrifying results.   One of my favorite movies is 13 Assassins, the Magnificent Seven, V for vendetta, the matrix, Mel Gibson movies lol.  </p>

<p>Some people always go with the flow and the upside is maybe you can keep your job longer but the downside is you might slowly become a monster, tied to the mast of the ship, incapable of refusing increasingly questionable tasks that clearly hurt people.</p>

<p>Are you going to be a voice of reason or chaos?  A voice of invention and futurism or primitive bigotry and territorialism?  </p>

<p>What are you going to stand up for?  Because if you don&#39;t stand up for anything, or are paralyzed by sadness, dismay or panic, then you are going to fall for anything.   </p>

<p>That&#39;s the disease, make sure you and those around you are doing those things and even if you don&#39;t get to live in the utopia of your dreams, you will at least be a person of value and your contribution will be significant, and your friends will be cool, and that&#39;s a pretty straight forward way to a good life.  (And maybe a &quot;glorious death!&quot;) </p>

<p>I am afraid the homeland security will turn into a &#39;people trump doesn&#39;t like who post on reddit&#39; force, and we aren&#39;t there yet.  nuclear war would also suck....</p>

<p>But I&#39;m not going to be a whining ninny, I am making my contrary voice as loud as I can.  That&#39;s how I sleep at night.  I jam the channels with my pirate signal, it&#39;s fun.  </p>

<p>And maybe accentuate the positive a little?   Just let me know if you hear about people being dropped from helicopters by the police, it is a time to be more aware of what the governmenet and police forces is doing.  Let&#39;s use this forum to keep it as hard as possible for them to surprise everyone with bullshit.   </p>

<p>That is all, carry on.  </p>

<p>tl:dr have courage, stand up for reason and your viewpoint, throw wrench in gears of evil, tune your radio to the pirate band, keep your ear to the ground, get back to work doing your thing </p>

<p>oh and dont be the one fucking everything up, that&#39;s what we&#39;re trying to keep other people from doing and that&#39;s what the undercover secret police in america are trying to trick you into doing.  </p>

<p>p.s.yes there are secret police in the usa in the form of undercover fbi and state police who infiltrate any potentially threatening assembly.<br/>
p.s.s. it would be really really interesting if a tool ever became available through wikileaks or whatnot that would actually tell you which nsa surveillance you had remotely installed on your phone or if fbi files were leaked etc....</p>

<p>I always thought it was weird how similar the George W years and Obama years were from a practical policy point of view,  ignoring rhetoric.  When trump won, i knew that if we just got more of the same from him then we know that potus is on a very short leash. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am giving Trump the benefit of the doubt at the moment. The more time that goes past where despite all these scandals unearthing themselves no one has been arrested or charged or anything yet, the harder it is to believe we weren&#39;t all duped. The only reason I&#39;m still keeping the faith is I know how long it legally takes to go about bringing an action against those type of high class white collar crimes. But the longer it continues with nothong happening the more it doesn&#39;t look good. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know this isn&#39;t t_d so I won&#39;t shill too much. </p>

<p>The Syria strike was a master stroke. I don&#39;t believe Assad absolutely gassed his people. I accept it&#39;s possible but the whole thing is fishy. </p>

<p>Trump, politically, can&#39;t just pull an Obama and risk accusations of inaction. The GOP would sieze on that and the Dems would gleefully pile on. </p>

<p>So he launches some missiles into some military targets as a one-time show of force. That speaks volumes to the entire world and as a brand new president, he needed to do <em>something.</em></p>

<p>Plus some awesome servicemen and servicewomen got to run a successful, casualty-proof mission that probably gave them all something to celebrate. </p>

<p>I think he&#39;ll grow into the foreign policy role now that he&#39;s been thrust into it. I still believe WW3 is less probable under Trump than under HRC. </p>

<p>As for Dems praising Trump, don&#39;t get used to it. Left wing praise for Republicans lasts about as long as a twig fire. </p>
