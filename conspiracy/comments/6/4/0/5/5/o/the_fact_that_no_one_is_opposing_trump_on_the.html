       This is the first time the Media hasn't shit all over Trump for a decision, and it's the biggest decision he's made as President.  Look at the top threads on r/news and worldnews.  It is hard to find a negative comment in there.  There are some comments making fun of Trump, but not criticizing his decision.  This is what the deep state wanted, and, in my opinion, makes me think the gas attack was a false flag.

       I think the strike was planned pre-gas attack to weaken the argument that Trump is a Russian puppet. The gas attack just gave him the perfect cover to do it without much criticism from American MSM.

       From the gas attack or from the missiles? What im saying is I think that the missile strike was due to happen regardless of the gas attack, it's just that the gas attack (regardless of who did it) gave him great cover for the missile strike. He gets praise from the MSM, and it pissed Russia off (supposedly) so a lot of non-Trump supporters are happy as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regardless of whether he actually has Russian ties or not, it's hard to say he does if he's openly bombing Syrian Military locations.

       ...what? No. Liberals voted for Obama under the (later outright false) pretenses he'd end foreign entanglement. Liberals hated Bush for getting us involved in Iraq.

       I don't know who the hell is supporting bombing anyone right now, but it's not a liberal trait to want to invade any more than it's a conservative one.

       Obama treid to green light a bombing campaign a couple times. Clinton pretty much promised it. If you are a liberal you can't allow men like assad to stay in power or even live. He stands against all of our values. Trump supporters online are the selfish cowards against freeing the citizens of syria. Luckily, the conservatives irl are very much for it.

       We also liberated germany, EE, and japan and turned them into flourishing free states. And with time and effort we can do it again. I don't see how we can knowingly let these people live under tyranny while we enjoy freedom, expecially when we are the strongest in the world.

       It's another WMD scenario, but this time they put a tad bit more effort into the deception, but not much as we all called BS on day one. Syria is going to turn into another Iraq, the fucking Zionist parasites in our government are going to profit immensely and Israel's will is going to get followed once more.

       Ive lost all hope with trump. Hes bought and paid for. He made the worst possible decision by bombing Syria without any congressional vote to straight dictator. Hes drawing U.S. and China into a greater conflict and giving a big fuck you to the people that voted him in. One of the few reasons I liked him was based on his less aggressive foreign policy; which is now udderly false. Trump is the wild card.

       Congress gave Obama an open grant to take actions like this, and they have not rescinded the orders. They should probably do that. So, regardless of what people try to say, or the ethics and morality of the attack, it was legal. But that is a standard move of our shitty governments, they make abhorrent things technically legal to get their way.

       He was always a wild-card, and that's why no one should have supported him. (And was the main argument against supporting him.) At least we knew where Hilary stood on these issues. If you seriously want to change politics, don't ever expect that change to be based on the power of one man who claims he'll fix everything.

       Trump repeatedly spoke out against the FSA while the US had bipartisan support for training that literal terrorist group to fight Assad. Trump's move here is surprising and disappointing but it's unequivocally wrong to say there was a better option on the table for people who don't want us to take a side between the awful dictator and the terrorists he's fighting.

       No he isn't. He responded to a false flag with a false flag to appease the global agenda.

       He warned the Russians when and where he would attack and they evacuated everyone and everything from the base.

       It's so obvious that they made a compromise and launched a pointless airstrike to save face. Russia was definitely in on it.

       Why do you think Obama asked for congressional approval through an obstructionist legislative branch though he really didn't have to?  And then save face with the Russian's plan to remove the chemical weapons? Because he found out about our "allies" trying to force his hand.

      <p>
       Not praising Obama. Just saying that Trump's reaction seems like an uninformed knee-jerk reaction. He's either sold or being played.

       My opinions change frequently. I don't watch MSM, hell I my TV hasn't ever played anything but stored videos and netflix. I don't breed, collect, and consume. I understand what you are getting at now though, and I am not going to say I am completely immune to the massive mind fuck that is perpetuated on everyone, but I try to live as far outside of the box as possible and am somewhat successful. You should try shaving with that edge there, dogg.

       I really hate both of these terms. I know that shills really do exist but these words are thrown around so often on here and on /pol and you just know that it's trump supporters doing it, branding all opposition as CTR/ShareBlue/CREW, etc.

       Can we be real for a second? How the fuck can your sub celebrate being the last bastion of free speech on the internet while making fun of safe spaces while you ban ANYONE who disagrees/questions god emperor? Even his supporters who've been with him from the start.  Honestly it's getting like the non-satirical version of

       Nah.  A lot of them were repersuaded.  There were big arguments, big discussions, lots of digging for truth on Syria.

       This perspective that they were all banned and/or called shills is what outsiders want T_D to look like so that curious people are turned away in fear.

       The truth of the Donald is a never ending maze of bullshit with every answer being "everything he does is perfect" and then reverse engineering convoluted explanations for dumb moves from there. Oh, and crushing all dissent so that the talking points and bullshit narratives become the only thing discussed.

       Trump is turning into the libertarian/conservative version of the progressives/dem's Barack Obama. I remember (naively) feeling so excited when he got voted into office. Between his overwhelmingly disappointing presidency and the DNC rigging the election, I became jaded pretty fast. I guess it's the other side's turn.

      <p>
       On the bright side, Americans from all stripes will be disillusioned with politics now more than ever. Maybe now we can all come together under the same realization that we've been duped and we can have that be a unifying factor.

       This is obviously splitting the people who are fans in his cult of personality from people who liked the policies he campaigned on. You might still be on board after he does a complete 180 on Syria, but people who voted for him because Clinton is a craven warmonger aren't going to be so much. And if you support the guy regardless of his changing positions wildly, that just reveals you as a fan in a cult of personality. Not someone who votes based on actual policy.

       At least 5 were killed though so that sort of throws the strike for no effect narrative out the window.

       I believe there were 5 killed about as much as I believe a plane hit the pentagon, there were WMDs in Iraq, or that they used sarin gas recently in Syria.  They had plenty of warning to evacuate, so that narrative is just more lies and propaganda

       A couple things actually.
      </p>
      <p>
       Intuition tells me that Trump is another Zionist cocksucker that wants to enrich his friends and family regardless of the impact on the masses.
      </p>
      <p>
       It tells me that it doesn't matter how many peasants die to achieve that so gassing a town or bombing some soldiers is no sweat off their backs.
      </p>
      <p>
       It tells me that actual death is good for the plan because no one is alive to dispute the story.
      </p>
      <p>
       It tells me that legacy media is an asset that wants to show results, bodies are results to the masses because as civilized as we claim to be we are still by and large goddamn animals.
      </p>
      <p>
       Essentially that is what I think is going on.

       You think because they the US is probably on their way to attack that they are not going to keep at least 5 ppl somewhere within the general vicinity? It's not a small base. A small base does not need 60 missiles.

       I'm very interested to know what the next steps will be. Trump HAS to know that US mercenary groups are behind the gassing, and I get it if he can't outright admit it and he has to claim Assad did it to save face.
      </p>
      <p>
       But Trump has made it clear that he wants to "go after ISIS," which leaves a lot of wiggle room for him to engage in further conflict in Syria. If he pursues this avenue then I can't keep giving him the benefit of the doubt over and over as part of some stupid "8D chess." In fact, I'll never want to hear that phrase again.

       Tillerson is saying that the US should attack Asaad if there is another chemical attack or if the US forces are attacked - neither of those things are difficult to imagine happening in the near future. They will either provoke Syria into attacking them or create another false flag event.

       It's a bad decision, but one Clinton would have also made, and Obama tried but was stopped by congress. You're not seeing a lot of pushback because most of us Dems aren't hypocrites and realize our choice of leadership would have done the same thing, regardless of it being a shit decision.

       I don't think that Clinton would have done "the same", or that Obama wanted to "the same". Both Clinton and Obama were aiming for a boots-on-the-ground, Iraq- or Afghanistan-style kind of operation, while this attack was mostly a show of force and will to appease the international community somewhat, and not much more. Why else would they warn the Russians who in turn would warn Assad to evacuate the base before the attack?

       I totally disagree. Obama's presidency was marked by a avoidance of "boots on the ground" operations, which earned him the ire of interventionists who wanted regular US ground forces Iraq against ISIS. Hillary and Obama had distinctive disagreements on foreign policy -- they were not one and the same.

       It was a totally unnecessary act. Trump would have gained respect, in fact, if he would have coolly assessed the situation instead of trying to go for an "easy win" by using military might. It's all a clumsy and transparent way to win public approval via wagging the dog.

       That's a fair point, especially your first one. Obama did love his drones. The boots on the ground thing was more of a thing for republicans and Clinton. I'd still maintain that both him and Clinton's main mission in Syria was to get rid of Assad and install a US puppet instead. How to get to that eventual regime change was a matter of dispute as you point out, but the desired end goal (at least to my mind) was identical.
      </p>
      <p>
       On your second point, I slightly disagree. On its face, any act of aggression or violence is an unnecessary act (except in direct defense of the innocent), but I can see at least some sense in this one.
      </p>
      <p>
       I disagree that he would have come out on top had he simply condemned the use of chemical weapons but not reacted militarily at all, or as some wish he did, had he announced that he believes (as I think he actually believes) that Assad wasn't really behind the chemical attacks. In either of those cases he would have either been branded as a Russian puppet even more relentlessly, or as a weak president who talks big but acts small, or both.
      </p>
      <p>
       The path he did end up choosing looks good on the news who already pushed the narrative that Assad was to blame without evidence to back up the claim, signals strength to potential foes abroad and neuters any further push for an all-out war since he already produced an arguably appropriate response. But again, I may well be wrong.

       It's not the decision Hillary Clinton would have made.  Invading Syria was going to be her policy.  This chemical weapons attack would never have happened if Hillary was in charge, because we'd already have boots on the ground in Damascus, and coffins of American soldiers on the way back.

       What scares me is that if I even for a second propose that the attacks were manufactured - everyone I know calls me a heartless sociopath and an Alex Jones follower. Nutcase fringe shitheads like him have made it so that doubting the official story means you're an immoral person.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean, look at what happens:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Trump is in the middle of a Russia probe inquiry where all of his advisers are quiting or being dismissed.
       </li>
       <li>
        Bannon gets dismissed from the security council
       </li>
       <li>
        Days later, while things in Syria are stabilizing towards Assad, this attack happens
       </li>
       <li>
        Trump does a 180 on his position of Syria and starts bombing
       </li>
       <li>
        Russia repeals the law which prevents direct armed conflict with the US
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Seriously? Is this a fucking Tom Clancy novel? Could this be any more straightforward?
      </p>
      <p>
       Granted, I hate Trump. He's bourgeois scum of the worst variety and he campaigned on a bed of lies, promising to 'save' the working man. Despite that, he did oppose War in Syria and was smart enough to take council from Tulsi Gabbard.
      </p>
      <p>
       So I think in light of the recent events, he's probably been 'compromised.' As in the CIA now has more leverage over him than the Russians do.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or he's just playing deeper into the script that the Russians want, which is some sort of direct conflict where the US makes intentional mistakes in several global theaters all at once, thus making America look both weak and bloodthirsty at the same time, so the EU will start buying oil from Russia/Iran/Syria instead.
      </p>
      <p>
       I expect sometime in the next few weeks we'll see an escalation in the South China Sea, maybe DPRK. The long term strategy is probably for the US to invade Iran itself. Once we're boggled in multiple places at once, Russia will make some moves to reclaim several of the former S.R.'s

       To combat being labeled a conspiracy theorist I think it helps if you frame the official story as a claim, not a brute fact, which is exactly what it is, simply a claim - which can be true or false.

       Trump's one advantage over Hillary for a lot of people was his supposedly noninterventionist stance, and now he doesn't even have that. Otherwise, he has been shown to be a marginal, if not outright incompetent, domestic leader, which is why his polling numbers have plummeted.

       Democrats right?
They were never left wingers. (Except a rare exceptional few like Bernie.)
They're nearly all right wingers pretending to be left wing (called NEOliberals).
Republicans pretend to be moderate right wingers but are actually extremely
right wing and authoritarian (called NEOconservatives).
      </p>
      <p>
       People often just call them both NEOcons because they're so similar and both suck.
Voting is not a scam, but the two party rigged system IS a scam.
Independent is the only way to go.
Although not all Independents are trustworthy.
Dr. Jill Stein is trustworthy but Gary Johnson is a Koch brothers shill
who is pro-TPP and far right economically.

       Check out Rep. Thomas Massie's appearance on Ron Paul's show today. He's the only congressman I've seen who directly questions whether the Assad regime was actually responsible for the chemical attack, rather than just criticizing Trump for not consulting Congress (as was Rand Paul's primary criticism).

       I personally have found that almost all of my friends (non-conspiracy people) are all opposed to this air strike, but even more so, are calling out the narrative!
      </p>
      <p>
       They think there is a conspiracy afoot and that has me so excited that people are waking up to this BS. I never thought I would be able to discuss this with them with such positive response.
      </p>
      <p>
       They are discussing this publicly and it's gaining momentum in the circles I run in. I hope this grows. We might get an influx of conspiracy folk as a result, god willing.

       Has anyone else seen this in their personal community?

       The people freaking out are generally the 120ish IQ sweet spot.
      </p>
      <p>
       The emotionally controlled (democrats and dumber republicans) are "OMG THINK OF THE CHILDREN!" and therefore support him.
      </p>
      <p>
       The smarties are freaking out because it looks to them like he fell for an obvious false flag.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump is 150+ IQ, literally a genius.    He's thinking several steps ahead.   He understands that this is a win for him that sets up more wins.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Muh Russia people, were cringe before with their desperation to push that retarded narrative.  They look even more moronic now.
       </li>
       <li>
        He looks strong to Korea, Russia, China, etc.   Putting himself in a good position.  They know if he makes a threat it's the real deal.
       </li>
       <li>
        He'll kill people in a second if necessary.  The question of whether he'd so this is now answered.
       </li>
       <li>
        He "did something"  he issue is now put to bed.   No boots on the ground are needed.
       </li>
       <li>
        By warning Russia before the strike WW3 was never really possible.
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       The drawback of looking like a fool for falling for the obvious false flag will be easy to spin.   IF it ever comes out he can blame the military, then usher in a new era of working WITH Assad/Putin and no one can blame him or say "Muh Russia."   If it never comes out, then Assad lost a few planes.   Not a crippling blow, Russia will just send him 20 more.
      </p>
      <p>
       If he now goes full retard and throws us into a hot war to remove Assad I'll eat crow, but his move was the right one.   Not only did he play his opponents for fools (again) but he's exposed his more flighty supporters while solving several political problems.

       The liberal media suddenly changes their tune when it comes to American foreign policy.  This is how it's always been.  The justification for the Iraq War came from the New York Times.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is why true anti-war liberals hate it when the right talks about the "liberal media" because it's just not true when the cards are down.  Sure, they play one side when it gets them clicks, but they're just using liberal consumers for their own ends.

       False flag or not, this was something they wanted.  I do not agree with the tactics of using gassed children to justify going into Syria.  My guess is that Assad will end up retreating into Iran and then we will go to war with Iran.

       Michael Savage was on the radio railing against the attack on Syria, and pointing out that the gas attack was a: false flag b: not sarin.  So there are some people out there speaking truth.  I disagree with him a lot but it's nice that he's not following the narrative.

       Nah he didn't mention who he thought did the false flag. He just said anyone who believes assad used nerve gas right now is a moron and also the video looked like a choking agent not a nerve agent, and the first responders would all be dead with no protective equipment of it was a sarin attack.  He was also very vocal about the moronic jingoistic attitude going around about this.

       Of course the gas attack was a false flag. Time will tell who's responsible for it ... maybe. My money is on Israel. Trump is getting his sugar cube and his little pat on the head by the media for doing what they wanted him to do. It's disgusting to watch.

       Insnt obvious they want to see him fuck up so they can call for a impeachment, even if its not this time around it could be the next or there after. Trump is on a serious death watch( his presidency) he should just hold off any further actions that may result in him further potentially loosing support of the people who elected him in the first place not to mention further driving his opposer away. Its loose loose right now, he should just l"et the fucking dust settle" and see what happens after he did his strike and adjust accordingly, hopefully in a non threatening manner.

       Ur average murican is suffering from too much neocon/neolib media overload to remember that in 2013, Murica,CNN,Fox news and co. also alleged that Assad used sarin gas on his own people which later turned out to be a lie. Turns out it was US supported moderate Syrian terroris...I mean rebels who used sarin gas.

         ...In fact, even before Assad’s forces gained the momentum, a UN official reportedly found evidence of rebels using chemical weapons but no evidence Assad’s regime did. This, from a Washington Times article by Shaun Waterman dated May 6, 2013:

        <strong>
         Testimony from victims strongly suggests it was the rebels, not the Syrian government, that used Sarin nerve gas during a recent incident in the revolution-wracked nation, a senior U.N. diplomat said Monday.
        </strong>
       </p>
       <p>
        Carla del Ponte, a member of the U.N. Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Syria, told Swiss TV there were “strong, concrete suspicions but not yet incontrovertible proof,” that rebels seeking to oust Syrian strongman Bashar al-Assad had used the nerve agent.
       </p>
       <p>
        But she said her panel had not yet seen any evidence of Syrian government forces using chemical weapons, according to the BBC, but she added that more investigation was needed. {emphasis ours}

       I think they are working on an angle that will keep Trump-Russia connection story alive.

       Look at the top thread in r/politics right now. Shareblue is trying to spin Pentagon giving a warning to Russians to avoid casualties as another evidence of Trump being Russian spy.

       Well, in all reality, it wasnt an attack, it was a show of force and the difference between the two is that there weren't any casualties. No individuals were harmed only property and aircraft were. Also, with the timing of the meeting between trump and China's leader, its plain tobsee that this was a strategic move to show that this orange dope isnt ducking around. Thirdly, him bombing assads airfeild appeases his opposition, while also further debunking the whole Russia hacked the election nonsense. From a strategic standpoint this is hopefully gonna end up in his, as well as the American peoples favor

       I totally disagree. Obama's presidency was marked by a avoidance of "boots on the ground" operations, which earned him the ire of interventionists who wanted regular US ground forces Iraq against ISIS. Hillary and Obama had distinctive disagreements on foreign policy -- they were not one and the same.

       It was a totally unnecessary act. Trump would have gained respect, in fact, if he would have coolly assessed the situation instead of trying to go for an "easy win" by using military might. It's all a clumsy and transparent way to win public approval via wagging the dog.

       What I am referring to by "replacement of western populations" is the decline in first-world birthrates to below replacement level coinciding with the population explosion of the third world, while we pay extortionate taxes to feed starving third-worlders, and to feed, house, and relocate the immigrants who are destroying our societies from within.

      <p>
       That's fair enough, and it's a more valid point for European nations anyway. US culture is becoming dominant around the world, there's not really any chance of its replacement, but to clarify what I mean, I am explicitly against the sort of cultural imperialism that has made the rest of the world act so much more American in the last century.

      <p>
       In a democratic society, that's exactly what it does. Letting in outsiders, failing to assimilate them, and letting them vote on the direction of the country does exactly that.

       It was a "rule through fear" attack by Assad.  He seems to have believed that the only way to peace was to make people too afraid of him to continue rebelling.  In service to that objective, he used a period of rare international support to try to get away by sheer chutzpah with a boneheaded chemical attack.

       <p>
        The next step would be, as I said, an alleged terrorist attack, which is quite easy. It’s, in fact, almost normal to—like Condoleezza Rice’s mushroom clouds. That’s easy to construct, alleged attacks. The other possibility is a staged attack of a minor kind. And how hard would that be?

       This is obviously splitting the people who are fans in his cult of personality from people who liked the policies he campaigned on. You might still be on board after he does a complete 180 on Syria, but people who voted for him because Clinton is a craven warmonger aren't going to be so much. And if you support the guy regardless of his changing positions wildly, that just reveals you as a fan in a cult of personality. Not someone who votes based on actual policy.
