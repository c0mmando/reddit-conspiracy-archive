<p>I always thought he was pretty stupid and could be influenced towards dumb shit, I also thought he wasn&#39;t a career politician and could be influenced to do some non-establishment shit. &quot;all hope lost&quot; &quot;sky is falling people&quot; are still being ridiculous.</p>

<p>This Syria move is a bad one, but this still doesn&#39;t categorically remove all possibility of him doing some good and non-establishment things. I still hate David Brock, I still hate John McCain, I still hate regime change and will be very vocal about opposing further action in Syria. </p>

<p>To me not much has changed. </p>

<p>Republicans still corrrupt<br/>
Democrats still corrupt<br/>
MSM still corrupt<br/>
Trump still new, self-serving, stupid<br/>
Trump also still can potentially be influenced to challenge and keep pressure on Dems/Reps/MSM </p>

<p>I LITERALLY said in my first sentence that &quot;EVERYBODY&quot; has a public and private stance. I didn&#39;t say anything about anything being &quot;acceptable&quot; or &quot;tolerable.&quot; I said it was &quot;necessary.&quot; Every world leader would hypothetically have a public and a private stance.

<p>That&#39;s exactly my point. <strong>Overlooking</strong> his foreign policy and all things Military(defense authorization act, extending PATRIOT act, droning the fuck out of civilians, allowing NSA to carry on...which can all be attributed to the military industrial complex; the JFK gun point at him) there isn&#39;t much bad shit he&#39;s done. Especially when you compare him to what came before and after he actually did shit to help Americans(shit Trump seems dead set of repealing simple because...something something obama). The stupid bullshit Trump keeps saying about how big of a mess he was left with, horseshit. I&#39;d love to see that orange clown deal with the mess Obama had. What mess did Trump have? Too much Clean air?</p>

<p>Dude, take your time. No rush. I&#39;ll wait. I&#39;d love to know what Obama did that was so wrong besides what I just mentioned. </p>

<p>Not really. The world feels betrayed by the people who elected him into the most powerful position on the planet. The whole world tried to warn you over and over again that he was glaringly incompetent and corrupt, but you wouldn&#39;t listen. He wasn&#39;t even subtle about it -- every time he opened his mouth, every goddamned day of the election and of his presidency, he outright says something that any decent person would be ashamed of, but now we&#39;re stuck with this crooked asshat who&#39;s tearing apart our country and our relationships with our allies. I don&#39;t feel betrayed. I feel sad because I was right.</p>

<p>Hope everyone picks up on this as a take away. That was always the intent. By Shareblue shills and Russian trolls. The whole point is is poison information and discourse in order to continue  carrying out the same plan that they&#39;ve been pulling off for most of modern history. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve said it time and time again, left and right and liberal and conservative is all bullshit meant to divide the common people in order to keep them distracted. Bernie was the only one who saw through this. That&#39;s where you need to look in the future. This isn&#39;t left versus right, it&#39;s the 99%  versus the 1%, and the 1% is winning, and always has been winning, and that&#39;s never, ever going to end while we&#39;re all divided over abortion and taxes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hillary would have taken us to war also so that&#39;s a whole other conversation, everyone got what they wanted, a world war possibly. I think it was the polarizing stances we were forced to take as citizens. </p>

<p>I do like conservative values, I agree with some immigration talks of Trump, I liked his business background for some reason.  I was raised conservative and while I didn&#39;t get along with my parents all the time and was a rebel I understood the values they wanted me to hold. Work hard, don&#39;t take handouts, suck it up quit bitching.. all I saw from my friends on the left was bitching, bitching about working, blaming everything on the government etc and I just got tired of it so I went opposite. I control my destiny not everyone else was the way I look at it. </p>

<p>Now I realize I&#39;m 26 fresh out of college and don&#39;t know shit about shit. Media and everything just got everyone riled up. I&#39;ve always been at my roots a conspiracy theorist, I guess I just wanted to try something new. Ideas are like drugs dude. Humans are weird. </p>

<p>This was a mind control experiment on a grand scale now I&#39;m starting to realize. Shit was weird man </p>

<p>Socialism? Where did I say anything about that philosophy? I&#39;m honestly not sure what you&#39;re talking about here. Who&#39;s a socialist? I can&#39;t name a single person that&#39;s a socialist... and definitely no American politicians in office that I can name.</p>

<p>In case you&#39;re unaware, Bernie is not a socialist.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you think Bernie isnt a globalist stooge, but Trump is, you are part of the problem</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t volunteer and donate to Bernie&#39;s campaign because I think he&#39;s my hero (he&#39;s not) or that he&#39;s uncorruptable (he&#39;s not). I supported Bernie because of the POLICIES he was promoting. Unfortunately, our <em>policy</em> choices were artificially limited in 2016 when the DNC cheated him and his campaign.</p>

<p>The increase in taxes if offset by the <em>savings</em> they&#39;ll see by not paying for healthcare. Since when is saving money a bad thing?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>more regulations</p>

<p>I&#39;m not a scientist but 99% of them believe in global warming.</p>

<p>more government bureaucracy is obviously the way to grow the middle class and stop government corruption.</p>

<p>Well certain programs at least, like Medicare, are run extremely efficiently, so you might be right.</p>

<p>Study history. Hitler was a (((National Socialist))). Throwing a qualifier infront of Socialism doesnt change what it is - a dictatorial collectivist government that forces its citizens to buy government run healthcare. How about instead of forcibly taking away our money we generate through our labour, we get to decide where that money goes rather than being forced to surrender it. </p>

<p>The idea of income itself is unconstitutional and violates the non-aggression principle. The government does not have the right to take away money exchanged between a private business owner and a private citizen working for that business. </p>

<p>Speaking of income, as automation becomes even more productive we will continue losing even more jobs. We will need <strong>basic income</strong> if our society does not adapt.</p>

<p>No, what I am talking about is not being taxed on our income in the first place. What you are talking about is forced wealth redistribution. Youll never be able to control what the government does with your tax money. It will always be wasted in bureaucracy. Instead of giving away 20% of my money to the government, freedom is being able to choose how I save or spend that 20% of my income.</p>

<p>The income tax is a recent event. This country was set up to have a small government that runs purely off of border taxes/tarrifs. Once the government started taxing income and sales tax, thats when freedom died and the free market became no longer free</p>

    <div class="md"><p>dude, I hope you realize that I am against corrupt multinational corporations buying off politicians to shut down competition and rig regulations in their favour. I hope you realize the regulations you want only affect small to medium sized businesses which disable the lower class from ever rising up and competing with the elites. </p>

<p>Have you ever opened a business? I have. Its fucking ridiculous the amount of red tape, taxes, and regulatory bullshit hoops you must jump through to simply sell something legally online. Once you try to start a business you will see why TRUE free market capatalism is so important to allow the middle class to grow and thrive. </p>

<p>I am against CRONY captalism/socialism, the system we have now. Multinational corporations such as WalMart lobby for this current system so people like you and me can never create our own businesses and rise up.</p>

<p>Again, the issue is not WalMart itself. The issue is that we give the government the power to allow multinational corporations to lobby for rigged laws. Take away the power from the government, and the multinational corporations will not be able to buy off politicians. Thats how you level the playing field. The issue is excessive governmental power, not businesses. </p>

<p>Local elections are important, </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Local elections pave the path to national influence.  There is no quick fix.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Now that progressives know that going through the Democratic Party is a dangerous waste of time (they literally wasted 6 years of our lives (2 years campaign + at least 4 years of a Trump presidency) </p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is not something that progressives know but rather something people who do not pay attention to the right things might come to misconstrue.</p>

<p>We have seen (or at least can see if we choose to look) that local coordinated action leads to empowerment at national level.  It&#39;s laughable that you&#39;re looking at 2 and 4+ years though and feeling your time has been wasted.  You&#39;re an order of magnitude off on realistic time frames for a solid foot hold as a political faction that cannot be ignored and must be reckoned with on the national level.  20 years would be an astoundingly rapid entrenchment (although not entirely implausible in the context of contemporary technology); 40 is more realistic.</p>

<p>Unless you don&#39;t go through one of the established main parties, in which case, you should expect it will take much much longer.</p>

<p>How it&#39;s done is localized networks are built to cooperate together to get their candidate on the local ticket in &quot;reliable constituencies&quot;, starting small and expanding to bigger elections as your network, pool of candidates with local experience, and your block&#39;s influence all grow together.  The initial focus is on the primaries in winnable constituencies.  </p>

<p>Taking over primaries is not that hard.  They don&#39;t draw many voters and they can often entail 3+ candidates giving a huge advantage to any organized block of voters.  The more candidates splitting and fracturing the field in a primary, the more effective a block of voters are in getting their pick onto the ticket.</p>

<p>This is why Evangelicals and the religious right have an outsized voice in the Republican Party.  They dominate local town hall meetings which tend to be sparsely attended, they pick out a single candidate for primaries and they support that candidate, they canvas for them, get on the phone for him, raise funds for them and then they go to the primary and they vote for them.</p>

<p>And note that the end result is that Republicans fear being primaried in many constituencies far more than they fear a Democrat taking their seat.   Even gerrymandered seats are not safe for individual Republicans.  They might be safe for the party but individuals will find themselves primaried off the ticket if they do not please their Evangelical masters in the constituencies that they control.</p>

<p>But it took them decades to get to this point and they got there using the established parties and starting small, (school boards were an important early target for instance).  Not through by-standing until voting day, or even just volunteering passively to achieve the party aims, but by participating as an organized block and ultimately transforming their constituencies into ones where anyone carrying out the party aims is carrying out their aims.  Organized blocks are very effective when they employ the simple strategy of persistently out participating everyone else as an organized single block.</p>

<p>The two main parties have huge resources and it will always be quicker and easier to subvert one of them than to out compete them starting from nothing.  But it cannot be done merely through voting or even passively volunteering after all the decisions have been made.  You gain a dominant voice in a party by forming an organized block and out participating all other comers.  It&#39;s a long haul, but for a stable entrenched influence, there is no quick fix.</p>

<p>I agree with most of your points with politics from the start of our country until 2017. Why is it different now? It&#39;s different because of <a href="http://www.internetlivestats.com/internet-users-by-country/">access to information</a> and <a href="http://www.nielsen.com/us/en/press-room/2015/recommendations-from-friends-remain-most-credible-form-of-advertising.html">social media</a>. It&#39;s also different because Americans have never witnessed corruption (and zero accountability for lies) at the level we saw via WikiLeaks and James Comey. Voters were deceived at every turn.</p>

<p>Now many of us know better, thankfully. The only problem is that we have no candidate. That&#39;s the first step. We need to start scouting around for decent candidates and once we find one or a few by the end of the year (hopefully) we&#39;ll have 3 years to run a campaign. We will get into the debates. And we will force Democrats &amp; other previous Bernie supporters that voted Clinton to join us. If they don&#39;t then Trump will get reelected. If Trump is really as scary as Reddit would have you believe then it would be scary not to take this movement seriously :) #BernieOrBust was given as an option in 2016. They chose bust. Will they choose bust again?</p>

<p>I agree with much of what you say. I will observe that the highlighted observation seems to miss the a major demographic change in our country. As the Boomers age and die, influence will spread rapidly to younger generations, especially the Millennials. They will benefit for the same reason Boomers did; they are legion.</p>

<p>I expect domestic political Change to happen at an accelerating rate for the next 10 years. This will include a major realignment of the coalitions and issues. If Donald Trump is impeached, this will happen sooner.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It takes time because you need to build a candidate base.  This is also why small local elections are good.  </p>

<p>By the time you promote candidates to state level elections, they should have been vetted in the public eye, they should have experience dealing with politics both in social terms (dealing with individuals to get things done) and structural terms (they should have an idea how government works, how the law works in broad strokes etc), and they should have a history of actually doing what is intended of them once you&#39;ve gotten them elected.</p>

<p>When you have a pool of candidates you can rely on who can win elections, you can take more risks.  If you have 50 candidates elected and one has a public humiliation it won&#39;t end the movement, if one goes rogue it won&#39;t completely demoralize the movement, if one falls on their face and fails spectacularly due to lack of competence in government, it won&#39;t discredit the movement entirely.  But if you only have half a dozen elected people in place, just one screwing up in a highly visible way can screw up the whole movement.  Reps on the school board screwing up don&#39;t have the same impact.</p>

<p>So the initial build up is slow - the movement has to identify and essentially train candidates to form the core of the movement&#39;s politicians - people who can win elections, won&#39;t bring scandal on the movement before it&#39;s established its credibility and won&#39;t screw up or turn on the movement and do the opposite of what they were supported to do.  That takes time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve made a fuck load of money in the stock market and stand to make a great deal more.<br/>
The economy is surging ahead at almost 1990&#39;s rates and my bonuses at work are starting to reflect it.<br/>
My neighbor(s) wages will increase as the illegals get sent home as they are over represented in construction jobs. This will increase the likelihood that our street gets cleaned up and houses are better maintained which increases my property value.  </p>

<p>Trump &amp; co. are maneuvering to end the illegal housing authority practices put in place by Obama that retarded the housing market for the last 8 years. Maybe the 15/30-year fixed rate mortgage won&#39;t be destroyed flushing The American Dream down the toilet like Obama planned on.<br/>
Maybe I&#39;ll be able to move this decade and buy a bigger house for my family. Right now we have too many people in our too small starter house.<br/>
290,000 new jobs created last quarter - 180,000 more than expected (given a Obameconomy).  </p>

<p>DeVos in charge of education means returning sanity to it. She&#39;s already started cleaning up the time-bomb of Obama&#39;s disaster-designed student loan programs. If she gets vouchers and charter schools pushed through as a parent/student right then I can take my kids out of the fucking awful public schools in this area and have them receive a decent education for at least part of their lives. Maybe by the time my grandkids are in college the federal student loan program will still exist as long as we don&#39;t allow any Demofuckheads destroy it between now and then.  </p>

<p>The ACA marginally affects me because I have a high income but it fucks over people like my step-sister and a kid I&#39;m helping out. My step-sister is a teenaged leukemia survivor which has left her crippled but she works so her income now tosses her out of the medicaid program but there are no affordable ACA plan on the independent markets. The kid I&#39;m helping out is effectively an orphan; his father died when he was young but his mom was an engineer until she got in car accident and got jacked up by that, addicted to pills, and is now a full drug addict. He turned 18 and got a job and needed to file his taxes and had no idea how to do it. He had to pay an ACA fine on his $6,000 earnings because he wasn&#39;t exempt because his mom gets disability benefits.  </p>

<p>So when you ask herp-derp what has Trump done for youz!?!?<br/>
The answer is everyfuckingthing Obama didn&#39;t and he&#39;s only 4 months in.<br/>
&quot;Hope and change&quot; my goat-ass.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So in 8 years the stock market went up from 7000 to over 18000 when Obama left office. And you say you made A Fuck Load of money because it went up another 2000 since Trump? Hmm! Jobs were coming back despite what you heard from Trump. Car companies were already planning to bring manufacturing here long before Trump. But you go ahead and give credit to Trump. Obama deported more illegal immigrants than any other president. But you go ahead. Give credit to Trump. As far as the ACA goes, it definitely needs help or revamping which is what your republican MAJORITY tried to do and couldn&#39;t. Why I wonder. Freedom Caucus? So &quot;My Bonuses&quot;, wages &quot;Will&quot; increase, maybe &quot;I&#39;LL&quot; be able to buy another house. The ACA affects &quot;ME&quot;. &quot;MY&quot; step sister. &quot;MY&quot; &quot;MY&quot; &quot;ME&quot;, &quot;ME&quot;, &quot;ME&quot;. The housing market bubble? Was the result of predatory lending by the Wall Street scumbags that are now working under Trump. Bubble was the result of, let me see, Bush? Jobs created LAST QUARTER? It was because of Trump? REALLY? I could give a rat&#39;s ass about people addicted on drugs. Not &quot;MY&quot; problem. &quot;I&quot;, there it is again, that &quot;ME&quot; syndrome, made a fuck load of money in stock market and you still live in a starter home? Dude, where I live, the housing market is crazy. Condos and homes have been going up in record numbers for the past eight years. The prices are going up because of demand and a good job market. Not because of that fucking moron Trump. Don&#39;t misunderstand what a Charter School is. They have their benefits. BUT, I repeat, BUT, they are independent PUBLIC schools. They teach in their own ways. Transportation would be left to parents, which I think is a good thing. Fuck those buses transporting kids to get an education. They will not have the same resources. They don&#39;t follow government regulations. Fuck &#39;em if they can&#39;t hire good teachers. Fuck those kids being taught by people with no teaching certificate. Fuck &#39;em if they have no resources and good facilities. I understand you have dreams. That&#39;s good. Good for &quot;YOU&quot;..but I have to say; the American Dream is not there like when &quot;I&quot; was growing up. Jobs were plentiful, wages were good but not great for the &quot;working&quot; person. People were able to buy a home on a salary of 30,000 a year in those days. Now that kind of money can barely buy a car. The future looks bright for &quot;YOU&quot; and &quot;YOUR&quot; kids and &quot;YOUR&quot; grandchildren, good for &quot;YOU&quot;. I am 62 and have never accepted a fucking dime from government. Sent my kid to Catholic school in a different town from where I live, paid for his education, and still paying, while still paying taxes to support the public schools in my area. Never once did I bitch about it. One more point on ACA and the independent market. How sure are you that it would work, that it will drive costs down? How sure are you that insurance companies won&#39;t charge even more even if there is competition? Look at what&#39;s happened to our industry. It has gone to China, Taiwan, India, Mexico. I can go on but it won&#39;t make a difference. &quot;YOU&quot; have your own set of values, you have your beliefs that Trump will fix everything and turn this into a Shangri-la. I have my own set of beliefs and values. I don&#39;t see it your way. Trump will not do anything to make our country even remotely great. He will be part of the problem. Drain the swam my ass. Look at Price, Mnuchin the rat, his Wall Street gurus, and yes even DeVos. Read about them and you&#39;ll find that it&#39;s all not peaches and cream like you want to think. It&#39;s one thing to be blind, it&#39;s another to have no vision. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It doesn&#39;t ever &quot;end&quot;. Bernie understands that you don&#39;t get anywhere in politics if you burn all your bridges (especially as the sole Independent member of Congress), and just as he&#39;s done his entire career, he&#39;s continued to fight for you and I every day since the election ended. Would it really have done anyone better if he had refused to support the only veritable opposition to the Trump Trainwreck?</p>

<p>We&#39;re all better off with him playing the long game to transform the political landscape as opposed to making enemies in Congress and among the already-fractured left as a whole over events that have already transpired (even if some of those people are corporatists, traitors, or just plain ignorant). He&#39;s continuing to do his job despite it being a thankless, merciless, uphill battle.

Shit half the republican party still have issues &quot;endorsing&quot; trump per say and he didnt even collude against them with the party.</p>

<p>Plus who knows what would have happened. He could have won the presidency (slim chance) or he could have kept enough voters from swinging over to trump out of disgust for the party to let Hillary win because shes apparently so &quot;popular&quot; across America.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The thing is though, Bernie isn&#39;t the kind of politician to play the &quot;character&quot; game unless the person is legitimately unfit to hold public office by way of character, policy, or qualification (like Trump), and as far as I can recall, he went out of his way to try to shift the conversation away from the &quot;damn emails&quot; and personal attacks toward the policies that actually affect American citizens on a daily basis. He never came out and said &quot;this person is unfit&quot; until Trump was a legitimate threat, and only about Trump. He obviously disagreed with Clinton on several issues, but he didn&#39;t make some kind of transparent 180 endorsement like Ted Cruz did, and as much as it might pain people to say, she has been in politics for years and knows a hell of a lot more about what she&#39;s doing (even if she does shitty things in positions of power) than Donald ever will, and would be preferable to the current administration despite her shortcomings. Shit, Donald&#39;s &quot;qualification&quot; was that he wasn&#39;t qualified apparently, because he isn&#39;t a politician; what kind of bullshit is that? </p>

<p>On top of that, Bernie never did sell out his values. His campaign worked with Clinton and the DNC to get several progressive policies installed in the Clinton campaign&#39;s mission statement. Would it have made a difference in her day-to-day policies if she had been elected? Who knows, but he DID try to make sure her campaign was palatable to progressives, and he did try to make sure that SOMEONE had a chance at beating Trump. In the end, Clinton was just bad enough a candidate and one enshrined in so much controversy that she lost to a complete shitbird, albeit one taking advantage of peoples&#39; ignorance, fear, and need for a sense of renewed hope. </p>

<p>That said, I don&#39;t think there was any scenario where Bernie could have won after the primary season or done something different to sway the results of the election. If he didn&#39;t concede his primary loss, the vote would have been split. If he did, I can&#39;t say with much certainty it would have ended much differently; I don&#39;t know if enough people would vote for an independent candidate for president in the current dichotomy, even if it&#39;s Bernie. Damned if you do, damned if you don&#39;t. At the end of the day, the Democratic Party and Trump (and his various handlers) are 100% at fault for this loss, and despite him and everyone else in this country being fucked over, Bernie&#39;s still fighting for us with the same values and fervor he always has. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe too beta? But with no baggage. Clinton was bullied. She had not one response to Trump. She cowered like a puppy. Would never have happened to Bernie. He was able to relay his message on issues that affect Americans unlike Trump who could not respond to any one issue except MAGA or Build a Wall or Mexicans are rapists or deport Muslims. Trump would not have stood a chance with Bernie. BTW, as we are learning now, the republicans picked the wrong candidate. If they stuck to their values they would have picked Kasich.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Bernie was controlled opposition from the start. On top of that when he talks about any of the issues he only appeals to emotions. Many of the things he wants to do are more about increasing government welfare and hurr durr taxing the 1% because, get this: He wants them to pay their fair share.</p>

<p>So many people pay more taxes than Bernie. He is just an ignorant communist. The guy hasn&#39;t done much in his whole life and wasn&#39;t even getting a steady pay check until in his later 30s. That attitude reflects by what he supports and by his inability to get anything done.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You need to see the other side of this. Trump appealed to emotions of Fascists and an Aryan base that believe only they belong here or the country belongs to them. What are some of the things that Trump wants to do? He selects Wall Street scumbags who are pushing and changing laws to line their pockets. He accused Hillary of this. He selected a man who wants to &quot;Deconstruct&quot; the State. He accused Obama of this ( &quot;I inherited a great big mess.&quot;) What a pussy he is. He selects his son-in-law to run most government agencies. In my book that&#39;s called a monarchy, or an Authoritarian government. He selects a man who is literally giving companies the right to poison people with pesticides and coal run-off that would pollute water. He selects a national security adviser who was in bed with Putin (Flynn). You remember him? He said he doesn&#39;t &quot;care&quot; about his business because running the country is &quot;so&quot; much more important to him. He has taken, from you too, over 60 million in tax dollars to play golf. 130 thousand a day for his wife&#39;s protection. In only three months. He selected a man (Tom Price) another scumbag who made triple his money on a biotech firm that he invested in. You think Trump is looking out for YOU? What about all the lies? What of the accusing the Intelligence community of wrong doing? How about the Flynn&#39;s collusion with Putin? Shall I go on? I don&#39;t think you have that kind of time on your hands. But please do tell me. Between Sanders and Trump, who has made life better for you? How has your life changed? Have you profited from the &quot;Swamp&quot; being drained? Have you profited from anything Trump has done? Emotions? That&#39;s total BS! And please don&#39;t go there, that Trump has created more jobs than Obama. Or that more companies are investing here because of THAT Fuckhead in the White House! Please don&#39;t. Good luck to you! The way things are going we&#39;re all going to need it. Please DO NOT respond to this.</p>

Build a wall. Drain the swamp. Deport Mexicans. Ban Muslims, and so many others. Who does that appeal to? Did not appeal to me for sure. I saw what he is about. He&#39;s thin skinned. A coward.

    <div class="md"><p>Being anti-war and being stuck with a war you didn&#39;t start are two different things. One of the big reasons that many many people didn&#39;t want to invade Iraq and all that other bullshit that W created was for the very reason that it would obviously be an unending quagmire. You can&#39;t just do a quick regime change and then go back to normal. It was a neo-con fantasy, if any of the people making the decisions ever believed it at all. As much as I didn&#39;t want military action to continue, Obama tried to limit it with drone strikes (for better or for worse). To a certain degree, Trump is stuck with some of the same pre-exisintg problems, only he lacks the intelligence or morality to make the proper decisions. We&#39;re fucked.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Our problem is that the constitution gives a low, unequal level of representation to people.  Our problem is that there is no provision for a state to leave the union even if it democratically elects to do so, the precedent is to go to war.  That means we have no pretense of a federation of independent states, we are an empire.  Finally a pet peeve with the constitution is the exception to the ban on slavery, and the subsequent leasing of government slave labor to private industry as a source of cheap labor with no rights (<a href="https://www.bja.gov/ProgramDetails.aspx?Program_ID=73">https://www.bja.gov/ProgramDetails.aspx?Program_ID=73</a>).</p>

<p>You can&#39;t vote to change those things.  You don&#39;t have the representation.  You can go on strike, maybe.  You can organize in your community.  You can participate online.  You can minimize your economic contribution to a corrupt system.</p>

<p>We can have beneficial, representative government, because many hands make light work.  We just have to all put in a little work to set things right in our own way.  Check out people like Ralph Nader, Robert Reich, and Larry Ellison for great examples to follow.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How so? Because she signed off on a weapons deal that like 9 other agencies had sign off on and had been done in the past? Or because literally 1% of her meetings were with donors that wasn&#39;t directly government business? (And AP&#39;s actual example was with a friggin Nobel Prize winner). Or because of all the shitloads of serious charity work they do around the world? </p>

<p>Seems pretty inefficient. I&#39;d take my bribing money elsewhere.  </p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying they were perfect or that the Clintons do anything to avoid this rubbing elbows image or even actuality, but the idea that this was a money laundering bribery scam is just childish. Especially when Trump&#39;s charity was, <em>in fact</em> a total bullshit money laundering scam. (Very low level, but it sure as shit wasn&#39;t a legit charity) </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are 3 most likely reasons for the events behind the gas attack, yet posters here act like there are only 2.</p>

<p>Option 1.  Assad gassed his own people on purpose.  Makes very little sense as many posters here have shown why.</p>

<p>Option 2.  False Flag.  Someone framed Assad to make it look like he gassed his own people to bring a international respsone.  Makes a lot of sense, but that&#39;s not enough to be considered proof so we still need to keep an open mind.</p>

<p>Option 3.  Assad had no idea chemical weapons were stored at the targets location.  Call it a &quot;accidental gassing&quot; if you will, but this is the one that makes the most sense to me.  He could still have been set up by other parties, but he was the one who sent the airstrikes so he bears responsibility for it.</p>

<p>This gives me a lot of hope. My own convoluted conspiracy theory was that Russia did the false flag attack, triggering US to react which would lead to Russian troops getting hurt and Russia using this to enter WW3 or take more steps to get closer.</p>

<p>If all they&#39;re saying right now is &quot;America did a stupid thing&quot;, that defeats my conspiracy theory and we&#39;re not going to have WW3 yet. That&#39;s really 99% of what I give a shit about. Fuck who gets the pipeline going, I just don&#39;t want to see a war that will shake the world under a nuclear holocaust.</p>

<p>We were close to having the ultimate neocon war mongering guaranteed ww3 puppet sell out bohemian corporate whore in hillary. I&#39;m not convinced trump is that, because if we all lose then he loses too. I think he got into office and realized everyone/everything around him is all swamp deepstate M.I.C. I just don&#39;t know anymore.....it&#39;s wait and see for me.</p>

<p>I do know that the Trump voters combined with the Chans can make big things happen, and we need a 3rd party baaaaad</p>

What&#39;s more likely is that people who don&#39;t want any agreement between US and Russia orchestrated the attack so that Trump was goaded into using missiles to show that he is not &quot;weak&quot;. 
Hence more tension between US and Russia, and if US tries to attack and Russia shoots down either missiles or planes that would be another ratcheting up of tension. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>When your entire economy depends on oil, sanctions on oil is very damaging. A chemical attack is exactly what you would make in order to get a lot of publicity, there is no reason to use a chemical attack in today&#39;s age, the media will blow it up immediately and will cause a lot of international outrage. They have the weapons to do the same damage without using chemicals, and they did it anyways. Right afterwards all this happens. Everything done under Assad is done under Russia&#39;s watchful eye. If you believe otherwise, then you must be dumb and blind. Russians were at that airfield that the attack originated from. It&#39;s no coincidence. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>the price of oil(and profits) dropped without the sanctions. And gas still flows easily into europe. Sanctions deal mostly with &quot;dual purpose&quot; things, like tech that can be used in weapons. </p>

<p>Saying that sanctions are crippling Russian economy is totally wrong. Yes, there is some damage. Yes it is felt by people. However the biggest damage to the economy was the price drop, a price drop that had absolutely nothing to do with the sanctions. </p>

<p>So this invalidates your reasoning for the attacks. Plus do you think they are really that stupid? 
Also there is no logic in your conclusion that somehow this is meant to lift sanctions. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s one air strike, Obama sent out tons against Syria during his two terms so lets take a deep breath here before reacting irrationally.
I&#39;m not sure how Trump responding here is the call for WW3 some people are making it out to be.  To me it comes across as concern trolling.</p>

<p>At this point what makes the most sense is Syria struck a position where the rebels were hiding chemical weapons, and the weapons went off making a international incident.  While not as bad as intentionally &quot;gassing his own people&quot;, it&#39;s still something that can&#39;t go unpunished.  It makes sense for Trump to send a retaliatory air strike against the airfield where these strikes originated from to send a message, &quot;If chemical weapons are used we will not stand idly by&quot;.</p>

<p>To me, a Bernie supporter and Obama voter in 08, there is no reason to assume Trump has gone full neocon at this point.  If the war drums start getting any louder and we actually go to war with Syria over this incident then I&#39;ll start believing the hype.</p>

I would have voted for Ron Paul in the Republican primaries but at the time, I lived in a state that doesn&#39;t have open primaries for independent voters. I voted for him a second time because Mitt Romney was useless in giving people, even staunch Republicans, a good reason to vote for him.  This last election was terrible because I did NOT want to vote for the witch.  I reasoned at least she would be predictable, unlike Donald Trump.  We&#39;d get more of the same s*** as we got with Obama; who knows what he will do.  I do feel sorry for most Trump voters.  Many may have even voted for Obama the first time, given the dissatisfaction with the Republican party for getting us into a needless war and for wrecking the economy.</p>

<p>It&#39;s time to realize hysteria doesn&#39;t help us at all.  I&#39;m not voting in 2020, for anyone.

<p>Dude, vote third party! </p>

<p>I&#39;ve been done with the hysterical bullshit for a while and from what I can tell the only people that really want to change the country for the better are sitting on the outside but still running for president because they still believe in democracy even if their chances are slim to none. These are the people that are spending tons of their own money to reach out and raise their voice even when it has the slimmest chances of even doing anything major.</p>

<p>We might not be able to make much of a difference, but you get a vote and you get to tell the country that you hate both bullshit candidates with it. You make a statement that your ass isn&#39;t just lazy and staying home and that you&#39;re actually politically motivated, but you legitimately think the two candidates are not worth your time. I&#39;d rather them know that I&#39;m one of the 5% of voters who hate their asses, not the lazy ass who &quot;probably would&#39;ve voted dem if they got their ass out of bed&quot;.</p>

This was a shitty, lose lose situation. Media fed lies about the gas attack, choice was ignore or attack. He was screwed either way. </p>

Now I don&#39;t think I am ready to say I am completely done with supporting him yet, because I do want to see how this pans out. For all I know he could be being played himself, (ie: JFK style). But the second he started getting all buddy buddy with Israel on the campaign trail I started getting iffy about my support. I am not making a decision yet, but he is certainly toeing the line right now. What is interesting to see is the almost parallel group think that hit the US after 9/11 going on right now. The people who were once completely against US intervention in the middle east are now up in arms ready to strike, that to me is crazy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They have been doing that for a while but when things like last night happen a lot of people get banned because they have no choice.</p>

<p>9 out of 10 ppl in there are not happy he actually dropped bombs last night. But they all lie to eachother to keep the image going. </p>

<p>This time yesterday the entire front page of t_d had nothing but evidence showing the chemical attack was a false flag and that we need to get Trump&#39;s attention to show him it was a false flag lmaooo.</p>

<p>Then he drops bombs and a ton of people flipped shit and couldn&#39;t believe it. Then their comments started getting deleted and they were getting banned. Then the echo chamber effect kicked in for those who are left and the only consensus allowed now is &quot;our god emperor is playing 9D chess. He killed the Putin narrative and scared the shit out of north korea!&quot;</p>

<p>If Assad had actually gassed his people I would have said that this strike by Trump was actually executed very well. But the bottom line for me is I&#39;d bet my bottom dollar Assad didn&#39;t order some small chem strike that would do nothing but make the world call for him to be attacked. Which he was last night.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This in no way means I support Hillary.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why is that a thought? You voted for trump for a reason and you are unhappy with what he&#39;s doing, period. I voted for Gary Johnson, but a few negative trump comments and people instantly label me a hillary supporter for some reason. There shouldn&#39;t be a correlation between the two, especially since the election is long over!  </p>

<p>Voice your opinion, you&#39;re not locked in to supporting your candidate anymore and blind support for the leader of a country is a terrible thing to have... </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s a bit ironic that it was so hard to convince this sub that the <em>President of the United States</em> is lying to them.</p>

<p>He said &quot;I&#39;m gonna bomb the shit out of them&quot; as well as &quot;we should have never gone in (to Iraq)&quot; like those don&#39;t contradict each other <em>during his campaign</em></p>

<p>He&#39;s not a lier he&#39;s a very literal con man, say what the room wants to hear to make a sale. Everyday the lie was new and exciting, that&#39;s what made him seem honest next to normal liars like Bernie and Hillary. He lied so much it gave everyone from pacifist to warmonger a statement they could hold onto to vote for him.</p>

<p>I mean Bush was an outsider conservative campaigning on avoiding failed interventions (Clinton in Kosovo) and what happened? He instantly went back on everything he said just like daddy. Literally the only reason I voted Hillary other than the economy was she seemed to genuinely regret the Iraq authorization. I mean she sucks but come on, people died. She&#39;s not quite hitler and I&#39;m a damn commie so I don&#39;t exactly love the women</p>

<p>As for Trump well <a href="http://mobile.nytimes.com/2017/04/03/technology/trump-repeal-online-privacy-protections.html">he&#39;s pulling shit like this while he isn&#39;t bombing random countries</a> </p>

I feel he doesn&#39;t have the mental capacity/education/emotional stability (but then I believed this from the start, this isn&#39;t NEW) to be POTUS <em>or</em> a politician. Yeah, he knows how to talk shit to &quot;make a deal&quot;, but he lacks big time. His backers think he can &#39;make things better&#39;, but IMO, it ain&#39;t gonna happen.</p>

<p>Seems like there&#39;s a lot of shit in his &quot;closet&quot; (I&#39;m just saying), this is not to say that politicians <em>don&#39;t</em> come with a lot of &#39;baggage&#39;. If anyone is going to be HONEST, they can (at least) admit that most politicians are taking &quot;money under the table&quot; <em>from someone/some corp.</em></p>

<p>Politics is a scam, far as I&#39;m concerned. HOW long will it take for people to realize that they are being <em>played</em>? </p>

<p>Hillary Clinton became irrelevant the moment the election was over. It&#39;s sad how <em>now</em> you cannot be critical of Trump without the implication of a Hillary supporter. Maybe <em>before</em> the election the implication could be valid, but now it&#39;s now &#39;Hillary vs Trump&#39;, it&#39;s &#39;Trump the President&#39;.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not trying to criticise you for saying you are not a Hillary supporter, I&#39;m just pissed off/disappointed there is an environment where you, especially now, have to declare that before you criticise the government.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Many Obama supporters felt the same way after &quot;change you can believe in&quot; became &quot;same shit, different asshole&quot;.</p>

<p>It is their new tactic - they know that Old Media and Old Politics isn&#39;t selling well anymore, so now they have rebranded.</p>

<p>People like me were warning the Obamabots and the Trumpbots that they were being suckered, but the desire for change blinded them. They were so desperate to <em>believe</em>, that no amount of evidence could change their mind until it was far too late.</p>

<p>The simple fact is, good or bad, if the media is talking about someone, they are promoting them. &quot;There is no such thing as bad publicity&quot;. So the more the media attacks or defends someone, the more you can be sure they are beholden to the elites.</p>

<p>It&#39;s the people the media refuse to talk about that you should be supporting (or at least considering) - the Ron Pauls and Bernie Sanders... the ones the media tells you have no chance and are not even worth thinking/talking about.</p>

<p>They are your best hope. But even then... in this system... it&#39;s a tiny hope.</p>

<p>A middle-income earner now taking in $36,200 a year – placing them in 50th percentile, when looking at 2015’s wage data – would see an 8 percent reduction, with their bi-weekly income slumping from $1,131 down to $1,040. Someone in the 75th percentile, with an annual salary of $58,900, would be hit with a  7.9 percent reduction.</p>

<p>High-income earners are set to be hit the hardest, with Americans with an annual salary of $92,110 seeing their checks fall from $2,609 to $2,391 – a whopping 8.3 percent ($218) drop in their bi-weekly pay.</p>

<p>Well certain programs at least, like Medicare, are run extremely efficiently, so you might be right.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The thing is though, Bernie isn&#39;t the kind of politician to play the &quot;character&quot; game unless the person is legitimately unfit to hold public office by way of character, policy, or qualification (like Trump), and as far as I can recall, he went out of his way to try to shift the conversation away from the &quot;damn emails&quot; and personal attacks toward the policies that actually affect American citizens on a daily basis. He never came out and said &quot;this person is unfit&quot; until Trump was a legitimate threat, and only about Trump. He obviously disagreed with Clinton on several issues, but he didn&#39;t make some kind of transparent 180 endorsement like Ted Cruz did, and as much as it might pain people to say, she has been in politics for years and knows a hell of a lot more about what she&#39;s doing (even if she does shitty things in positions of power) than Donald ever will, and would be preferable to the current administration despite her shortcomings. Shit, Donald&#39;s &quot;qualification&quot; was that he wasn&#39;t qualified apparently, because he isn&#39;t a politician; what kind of bullshit is that? </p>

<p>On top of that, Bernie never did sell out his values. His campaign worked with Clinton and the DNC to get several progressive policies installed in the Clinton campaign&#39;s mission statement. Would it have made a difference in her day-to-day policies if she had been elected? Who knows, but he DID try to make sure her campaign was palatable to progressives, and he did try to make sure that SOMEONE had a chance at beating Trump. In the end, Clinton was just bad enough a candidate and one enshrined in so much controversy that she lost to a complete shitbird, albeit one taking advantage of peoples&#39; ignorance, fear, and need for a sense of renewed hope. </p>

<p>That said, I don&#39;t think there was any scenario where Bernie could have won after the primary season or done something different to sway the results of the election. If he didn&#39;t concede his primary loss, the vote would have been split. If he did, I can&#39;t say with much certainty it would have ended much differently; I don&#39;t know if enough people would vote for an independent candidate for president in the current dichotomy, even if it&#39;s Bernie. Damned if you do, damned if you don&#39;t. At the end of the day, the Democratic Party and Trump (and his various handlers) are 100% at fault for this loss, and despite him and everyone else in this country being fucked over, Bernie&#39;s still fighting for us with the same values and fervor he always has. </p>

<p>Isn&#39;t that the essence of a conspiracy? Isn&#39;t that what r/conspiracy is all about? Don&#39;t all posts boil down to &quot;maybe it is, maybe it&#39;s not&quot;?</p>

<p>It goes against your narrative and agenda though so better dismiss it.</p>

<p>Not really. The world feels betrayed by the people who elected him into the most powerful position on the planet. The whole world tried to warn you over and over again that he was glaringly incompetent and corrupt, but you wouldn&#39;t listen. He wasn&#39;t even subtle about it -- every time he opened his mouth, every goddamned day of the election and of his presidency, he outright says something that any decent person would be ashamed of, but now we&#39;re stuck with this crooked asshat who&#39;s tearing apart our country and our relationships with our allies. I don&#39;t feel betrayed. I feel sad because I was right.</p>
