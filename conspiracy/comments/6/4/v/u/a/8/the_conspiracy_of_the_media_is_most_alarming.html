       What war? Trump has told Fox he won't be going into Syria. This was a one off missile attack on an air-base which intelligence says was holding the chemicals that killed all those children.

      <p>
       Funny that you're telling us not to trust the MSM, and then immediately believe all their false hype about how we are heading to war in Syria. Where was the hype with the 26,000 bombs Obama dropped in Syria? There was none

       You're great at not answering questions. Who's intelligence agency agrees with the reports put out by TASS? Are you saying the mainstream media narrative is not pushing for further military action in Syria?

      <p>
       You make no sense. You argue that mainstream media covered up Obama's actions, then defend their present narrative. All the while avoiding my questions. Would you like them for them to continue their narrative until we are in a war?

       You are only half right. The point that needs to be stressed is not about Syria but about
       <em>
        War itself
       </em>
       . The American "Neocons" want a World War. Doesn't matter against who...Syria, Iran, Russia, China, North Korea...any will do. Just so long as it's a War. Why? The economy is a hairs width from imploding and they want the public to place the blame on the "War" and not on the Bankers and Politicians.

       Up until now, yes. North Korea, in and of itself, is irrelevant. The point is that the public is paying attention to this and not to what they
       <em>

       Do you pay attention to economic matters at all? Do you know what actually backs the US Dollar (hint: It's
       <em>
        not

       Gold)? Do you know why the "Federal" Reserve Bank hasn't raised interest rates yet despite their promise to do just that? Are you aware that Syria, Russia and China has all dropped support for using the US Dollar? Coincidence then that they are all US Military Targets?

       Despite you clear attempt at sarcasm, you are, however unintentionally, closer to the truth then even you care to admit to. If Syria, Russia and China are "allowed" to abandon the use of the US Dollar for trade then the US economy will tank -
       <em>
        writ large
       </em>
       . Then
       <em>

       You know the BRICS plan. For it to work it needed someone like Hillary Clinton and a destroyed dollar. It didn't work. And now too many other countries (yes,sovereignty is making a comeback) currency is built around the dollars survival. But ya, that was the supposed ending to the 30 year conspiracy. It didn't happen.

       The dollar is fiat, like all modern currency and is not backed by any tangible goods. It's value comes from our society

       You guys are kinda both right at the moment. Nothing has actually happened yet (aside from an airstrike)...

       I think Trump will just flex his muscles in front of everybody, then make deals... He want people to think he would do it, but doesn't really want to. If anything, he will do one, two or a couple more strategically targeted airstrikes on bad hombres around the world, but I don't think we are going to go to war with anyone unless there is an agregious, unprovoked attack by some non NATO country.

       Obama was ostensibly bombing ISIS, and never "officially" bombed Syrian government targets. Trump has waded in with the first publicly declared deliberate bombing of Syrian state infrastructure since the start of the war in 2011. Big difference. Huge.

       Nearly every MSM outlet is owned by one of 5 corporations. There is no freedom of press. They push whatever agenda their corporate owners tell them to. So yes, they're always lying, spinning, and pushing stories and narratives to try to influence public opinion.

       I don't think anyone really thinks Trump is not an asshole. At least around this sub, most Trump supporters either chose him as the lesser of two evils or belong to the camp that thinks Trump can't be bought.

       Watch carefully what happens when it becomes clear that the situation in Syria is not going to escalate. The media will flip on Trump just as fast as they flipped to praising him following the strike.
