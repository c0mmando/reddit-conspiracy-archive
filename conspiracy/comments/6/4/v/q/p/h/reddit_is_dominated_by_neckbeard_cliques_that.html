        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">29</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2017-04-12 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/Nikolasv.html">Nikolasv</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Reddit is dominated by perhaps a few thousand super neckbeards who have the most karma, mod between 20-200+ subs, who have the largest clique of &quot;online friends&quot; to game the voting system, <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/Drama/comments/62wtin/unikolasv_drops_a_redpill_about_the_losers_who/dfpnzxk/"><strong>aka the unidan effect</strong></a> and silence enemies or karma competitors, and put in more time on Reddit and cultivating these friendship cliques than some of us spend working. Reddit gives too many tools for people with no lives like the voting system, the subreddit system and the ability to create infinite alternative accounts to turn the medium into the &quot;game of Reddit&quot; that they then &quot;win&quot;. Which of course comes at the price of losing in real life. These neckbeards prefer to organize on off of Reddit persistent chat venues like irc, slackchat or discord to game the rules of the medium. Brigading and doxxing are only punished on the site, which means only normal users are penalized effectively, because the neckbeards are constantly discussing Reddit on these persistent chat mediums and creating cliques of online friends. <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/ModSupport/comments/61twfz/i_think_reddits_doxxing_policyrule_needs/dfix6vd/">A Reddit admin even highlighted this double standard</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We will take action against users that post another user&#39;s personal information, either directly on reddit or linking to it off-site. ... <strong>However, we usually cannot rely on screenshots because they are easily faked. If this is all occurring off-site and not being posted anywhere on reddit, then there is usually little we can do</strong> ...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But the only way you can document the neckbeards using off site chat systems is via a screenshot! The more successful of these neckbeards parlay this even into moderating alot of subreddits, and the super neckbeards eventually through these &quot;online frienships&quot; mod an appalling amount of popular subreddits. </p>

<p>I started upon this analysis by accident after noticing that I was constantly downvoted on <a href="/r/vegan">/r/vegan</a> viciously often well below the viewing threshold for innocuous posts. I eventually noticed that I had a circle of very vocal enemies, who despite writing what I thought were idiocies, were eerily rewarded with lots of karma for the standards of that sub for writing bone-headed comments and sharing popular myths. For a long time I wondered why that was. According to my karma breakdown I am at -100 karma for <a href="/r/vegan">/r/vegan</a>, but that stops counting at -100, so I am even further in the black. Eventually I realized my circle of enemies were posting to <a href="/r/vegancirclejerk">/r/vegancirclejerk</a>(where I have -78 karma). An aside: as a 35 year old I remember the pre-Reddit internet where the type of stupid puns, unfunny jokes and trouble-making seen on circlejerk subs would get one banned from a discussion forum for turning the place into a soap opera. Eventually on <a href="/r/vegancirclejerk">/r/vegancirclejerk</a> I noticed they created a thread linking to their irc channel and a web-based irc applet. So I joined and found my enemy clique discussing me, brigading to threads I created, brigading to threads they created, threads others created. </p>

<p>Here are some screenshots I snapped back then:<br/>
<a href="http://imgur.com/a/srfLA">http://imgur.com/a/srfLA</a></p>

<p>Now if you look at the screenshots, pay attention to two usernames:  <a href="/u/justin_timeforcake">/u/justin_timeforcake</a> and <a href="/u/DrGalactus">/u/DrGalactus</a>. Back then 2 years ago, both were not mods of <a href="/r/vegan">/r/vegan</a> but today they have &quot;experience pointed&quot;(to us rpg lingo Redditors will undrestand) all that online friend making into becoming mods of <a href="/r/vegan">/r/vegan</a>. Later I will prove that with archive.org links...</p>

<p>This is a pattern repeated all over Reddit, if you are just a normal Redditor that does not go onto irc, slackchat and discord you are like a second class poster with all the tools of mayhem Reddit allows for those willing to trade non-existent social lives for Reddit social power. You can easily be silenced like I was in the past and continue to be, being banished below the viewing threshold, getting banned(like I was from <a href="/r/vegan">/r/vegan</a>). But if you are a neckeard or super neckbeard abusing persistent chat you can write idiocies, stupid opinions, and be catapulted to moderator dozens or over a hundred subredits and be as capricious as possible and &quot;win the game of Reddit&quot;. Indeed Reddit&#39;s idiot staff not only knows about this stilted dynamic, they cater to it as revealed when the media investigated the ruckus that <a href="/r/the_donald">/r/the_donald</a> caused: </p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://gizmodo.com/reddit-is-tearing-itself-apart-1789406294">Gizmodo: Reddit Is Tearing Itself Apart</a> </p>

<p>...</p>

<p>Reddit’s Cozy Relationship With The_Donald</p>

<p>... a Reddit spokesperson, who did not wish to be identified by name, told Gizmodo in a phone call. ... “The [moderator teams of <a href="/r/the_donald">/r/the_donald</a>] that I’ve been involved with for the last six months or so, we’ve actually had a very close working relationship with. <strong>We share a Discord channel with them—their private chat. It’s been highly responsive when we need to ask them to take things down that are probably rule violations,” Reddit contended.</strong>* ...</p>

<p>If Centipede Central is the chat Reddit is referring to—a chat room within the Slack-like Discord program, the one linked in the sidebar of The_Donald and one of the largest servers on Discord—its users have encouraged the harassment of other moderators, artificially inflated the vote count on posts, ...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So there you have it, Reddit staff also advantage those super neckbeards by allowing them to create havoc on Reddit as long as they organize it off of Reddit, and they still will co-ordinate with them. Did the Reddit lightbulb staff ever consider investing their time with, say regular users and their user experience instead of catering to the tens of thousands of neckbeards and super neckbeards that ruin Reddit by turning it into the &quot;game of Reddit&quot;? </p>

The pro Trump crap is always massively upvoted, it was so obviously a coordinated group effort by people with a lot accounts.

    <div class="md"><p>It is alot bigger than the_donald, infact the sjw super neckbeard faction is far worse, they will ban people who don&#39;t even post in their subs yet for posting in wrongthink subs. And Reddit doesn&#39;t frown on alternate accounts because the scumbag founders like Ohanian have admitted that is how they got the site to succeed. They &quot;faked it till they made it&quot;. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well according to this it took Reddit a long time to figure out this unidan did and this explains the &quot;unidan effect&quot; how upvoting your comments early and downvoting karma competitors early is so vital:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://mashable.com/2014/07/31/unidan-banned-reddit-permanent/#AU82VihiTGqN">http://mashable.com/2014/07/31/unidan-banned-reddit-permanent/#AU82VihiTGqN</a></p>

<p>Reddit administrators discovered that Eisenkop[unidan] maintained five side accounts, which he used to both upvote his own submissions and comments, and downvote opposing comments.</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>Considering that before the incident, Unidan had the second highest total comment karma out of all Reddit users, this was kind of a big deal.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The idiot Reddit herd just reward what other loser Reddittors already reward with karma, and punish further those posts that already have negative karma. Sadly that is how most loser humans think. Imagine a school with only ten students all male, to be simple. 6 of them are skateboarders and the year just started. You don&#39;t think given what you know about human behavior that the trend will be that some of the remaining 4 will take up skateboarding to fit in whether they like skateboarding or not?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah just look at the up vote to comment ratio in TD. There&#39;s currently a story on there with 6100 upvotes and only 20 comments total.  </p>

<p>They are hemmoraging real trump supporters and are desperately trying to maintain the appearances.</p>

<p>I find it amusing how they call everyone else shills when they are the largest coordinated shills on reddit. Someone is paying for round the clock moderation, bans and thousands of bots for upvotes. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah they are definitely complicit too and it was incredibly obvious during the election. It&#39;s just much easier to see on TD as every post is at thousands of up votes and their up vote to comment ratio is anywhere from 20x on the low end and 200x for high end. Their vote inflation is reaching Zimbabwe levels of ridiculousness. </p>

<p>They should just remove karma and scores entirely on all political threads. It will remove the game element for a lot of people who just want a karma high score. </p>

<p>Spamming kek killary drumpf cheeto etc adds nothing of value to a discussion. </p>
