        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Why does everybody always assume that Weiner is in witness protection or that he/huma are now informants or something?</p>

<p>Did anybody ever consider or discuss on this sub that perhaps Weiner just got away with it all, and the whole &quot;life insurance&quot; thing was a means to absorb the blow from the picture leaking of him with his weiner out next to his kid?</p>

<p>The guy is basically just walking around in public as a free man, and the press is totally off his back for whatever crimes he may have committed - I can&#39;t believe I never considered this before, I always just assumed he was being processed</p>

But you&#39;d have to speculate that Weiner&#39;s laptop is what they are talking about cause from a purely FBI disclosure standpoint they have never mentioned it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Part of it is that criminal investigations and court proceedings are ridiculously slow. A single hearing can be scheduled months apart, and no doubt his attorneys are asking for as many continuances as they can for even the most mundane request. </p>

<p>With that said... he might definitely get away with all of this. When the court proceedings have wrapped up a year or maybe two from now, he might get some stupid sentence like &quot;probation in the form of 80 hours of community service.&quot; Any whispers about how he has insurance files of politicians/Clinton and so much cp that it made the NYPD nauseous will get chalked up as mere unsubstantiated conspiracy. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Haha, well until the whole Syria deal, I was sort of a (questioning) Trump supporter - but after seeing that shit show of a false flag, im out of there - but &#39;weiner being an informant&#39; sort of came along with that &#39;Trump draining the swamp&#39; storyline, which is now all obvious bullshit - then I saw an article about Weiner, and i was like &quot;well fuck, now I KNOW this guy is going to get off totally scott free&quot;</p>
