       Not really. Contract law enforcement is reactionary, not proactive.
      </p>
      <p>
       While some contracts contain various provisions that are unreasonable and illegal to enforce. For enforcement of contract law to actually occur, someone actually needs to take the contract to court and have the judge issue a verdict.
      </p>
      <p>
       The issue is getting a case before a judge is difficult as large corporations have significant financial powers. Unless the lawsuit is class action, the corporation can literally drag the plaintiff through legal hell until they accept an out of court settlement that prevents a ruling on the contract from being made.

       funny you should bring that up.
this happened to my family years ago.
land-locked and surrounding landowners restricted access in/out.
the family cemetary still exists to this day.

       Most terms of service break laws. Even if they didn't break laws they break common sense and being nice to other people.
      </p>
      <p>
       Terms of service, binding contract... I'm not saying it's right I'm just saying it's in the clause. I was pissed when Microsoft updated their policy to "If you use our service you can not sew us. Maybe out of court, but you can't sew or be part of a class action law suit.
      </p>

       i'm pretty sure that's illegal and if you had a case with solid evidence against them breaking the law, you could still sue, no?

       the thing is, i can file a lawsuit without their approval ... their lawyer will just receive the notion ... they can't stop me.

       I bet another airline will come out and guarantee this will never happen if you book with them.

       It's not just the airlines but the airport itself. I had items stolen out of my luggage and wrote a letter to the airport and airline to advise them. I told them what was stolen and on what flight at what time so they could at the very least record it so if similar thefts occur they could center in on the person. They wrote me back a standard answer letter that showed all that they cover if stolen. Basically they cover your shirts, socks and gotchies everything else can be taken with no payback. Check into this before you pack.

       Not really. Contract law enforcement is reactionary, not proactive.
      </p>
      <p>
       While some contracts contain various provisions that are unreasonable and illegal to enforce. For enforcement of contract law to actually occur, someone actually needs to take the contract to court and have the judge issue a verdict.
      </p>
      <p>
       The issue is getting a case before a judge is difficult as large corporations have significant financial powers. Unless the lawsuit is class action, the corporation can literally drag the plaintiff through legal hell until they accept an out of court settlement that prevents a ruling on the contract from being made.
