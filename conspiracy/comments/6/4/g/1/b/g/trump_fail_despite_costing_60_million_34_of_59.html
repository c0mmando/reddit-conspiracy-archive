        Confirmed as true through personal sources in the Syrian security services.  Electronic countermeasures were used along with missile interceptions.  The missiles were fired over Lebanon in order to avoid Russia’s S400 system or the possibility that a ground based cruise system would take out America’s boats.
       </p>
       <p>
        Five missiles fell in the surrounding villages, killing 5 civilians and injuring 20.  Other missiles fell into the Mediterranean where they could be viewed from the decks of the ships that launched them.
       </p>
       <p>
        The last time the US went against Russian ECM, 27 crew members of the USS Donald Cook asked to be “relieved.” Mutiny is a better term.  Then there is this epic fail, the RQ 170 Lockheed drone that ECM brought down over Iran.

       There isn't much of that ... and the US has a fair bit of "unseen" tech as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, In general your comment is correct.  The US Military is the largest in the world, it takes YEARS for updates and new tech to work it's way down into the system:  Some things, like cruise missles, work well enough that upgrades aren't a priority -- however that does not mean improvemed versions don't exist: they just haven't been purchased en mass ... primarily because the improvements aren't needed in a primarily peace time mission.
      </p>
      <p>
       When pushing starts, you can be sure a raft of new upgraded components will be front-lined and mass produced.
      </p>
      <p>
       We saw this in early IZ and AF.  The Army had uniforms/weapons from the 80s.  Once combat started, things started to be upgraded/replaced.  Because the "war" was limited, it wasn't given much urgency - other than politically.  Yes, the Pentagon did create various "fast track" programs for new gear, it still took years, and most new items only get issued in theater.
      </p>
      <p>
       A real shoving contest and those fast track programmes would become much larger, much faster.

       If electricity generators were damaged, how long would it take for the US to replace them? Experts say YEARS, and they are manufactured in China.

       Once you lose your manufacturing base you lose it. That's why the US buys rockets from Russia.

       History.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look at previous Force on Force conflicts - even just those involving the US.
      </p>
      <p>
       During The Great War, and WW II, Germany was a top tier nation (arguably
       <em>
        the
       </em>
       top) and Japan was in the top five.  The amount of US based espionage was either conducted was trivial.  A few minor demolitions.  Germany had numerous nationals -- some were rounded up in various purges, similar to the Japanese.  Additionally both wars had large numbers of anti-war protesters, none of whom managed to inflict anything of consequence.
      </p>
      <p>
       And this was at a time when the infrastructure was much more vulnerable to such attacks.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's arguable whether counter-espionage was any less or more component or capable than today, and as such targeting of "spies" is no more or less likely today to "bust" a target.
      </p>
      <p>
       Conducting such counter-espionage is just really, really hard.  It doesn't work on large scale and rarely works on small scale.

       You're watching too much TV if you think sleeper agents are in your neighborhood waiting to pounce on you.

       If you don't believe there are sleeper agents in the US then you obviously weren't paying attention to 911.
      </p>
      <p>
       911 was a cheap magic trick. Only bad magicians use CG. The Israelis planted real explosives in the WTC but used CG to make it appear "hijacked planes" flew into them. Want proof?
      </p>

       A Pentagon employee crawled through the hole and saw no evidence of a plane:

      </p>
      <p>
       Major General Stubblebine confirms that the wreckage at the pentagon is consistent with a missile and not a plane:

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       This WTC witness insists it was a bomb, no plane:

        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bq1-BCeNcm0
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       These firemen said they counted 3 explosions. The Police/FBI are reported to have attributed this to vans with explosives in the WTC basement:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfxkcBmZfK0">
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfxkcBmZfK0
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       You can also see raw footage (ie. not altered to show a CG plane) that shows the missile impacting the WTC (no plane):
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wF74zTLjNg">
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wF74zTLjNg
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       You can see a comparison showing the NBC footage showing no plane was digitally altered to show a plane (as well as adjust the colors to make the buildings appeared white and sky blue for increased psychological impact):
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPKq2K2dh6k">
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPKq2K2dh6k
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       The altered footage in some cases is obviously fake, for example tiling smoke:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkzfKRe0gbc">
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkzfKRe0gbc
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       But what wasn't CG was the explosions and the plane cutout shape they created. You can see those small explosions here (6 minute mark):
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rT1z90BB8E4&amp;amp;feature=endscreen&amp;amp;NR=1">
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rT1z90BB8E4&amp;amp;feature=endscreen&amp;amp;NR=1
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       The cutting charges were planted by Israeli Mossad posing as art students who rented a whole floor and got construction permits at the site, and made a temporary balcony. They even made a book about their "art" - which showed them standing next to boxes and boxes of explosives fuses in the WTC!
      </p>
      <p>
       Mossad agents filmed the missile impacts/explosions (to add CG planes later and pass on to media) and later went up to the roof to plant radio jamming devices. They were arrested and this is documented by the FBI. There was traces of explosives in their van and they were set up filming BEFORE the attack:
      </p>
      <p>
       Let me stress that again, the FBI arrested dancing Israelis on 911, not muslims. They refused to take lie detector tests for months, and when they did, they failed. So much of that FBI report is redacted, proof positive of guilt.
      </p>
      <p>
       They needed to fake plane impacts because a real plane would be shredded by the WTC like cheese through a grater. That's why when the Transasia plane collided with a taxi, the wing broke off, and the taxi wasn't sliced in half at all:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQ29Zr7wWnw">
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQ29Zr7wWnw
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       According to a WTC architect in a 80s interview, the impact of a plane (300 tonnes) is nothing compared to the 13,000 tonnes of force trying to push the WTC over simply because of its enormous surface area.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E15GbdVaV-Q">
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E15GbdVaV-Q
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       WTC project management engineer atttests the buildings could survive multiple plane impacts.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fQlC2AIWrY">
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fQlC2AIWrY
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       The WTC designers did a study for 600mph-1 impact which showed the towers would easily withstand the 911 attack.
      </p>
      <p>
       Someone planted an engine (though wrong make) to further the plane deception:
      </p>
      <p>
       Essentially the media got punked by Israel, because journalists just report what they're told. You can see another example of newscasters being fooled by a movie set into thinking it's a real plane accident. At the 7 minute mark in this video:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wozTHxykDwQ">
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wozTHxykDwQ
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       The larger 911 plan required the destruction of the Washington bridge and Lincoln tunnel. That would take out the fiber optic cables linked to stock market/banking, markets would have crashed and there would be martial law introduced. You can see this TV report on the other Israeli vans that were intercepted, one of them exploded:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmpWe2Rhi_I">
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmpWe2Rhi_I
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Israeli companies moved out of the building months before the attack. Israelis in America were warned in advance through an Israeli messaging service:
      </p>
      <p>
       Hundreds of Israelis were flown out of America, despite a flight ban, to avoid them being arrested by the FBI, including the "art students":
      </p>
      <p>
       Israel is the almost only country that benefited from the September 11 th attacks. In the words of Netanyahu, "it's good for Israel".

       I now understand why you made you original comment ... you had this prepared doc waiting in the wings which you want to post whenever you can.
      </p>
      <p>
       I get that you aren't happy with the 9/11 events and outcome.
      </p>
      <p>
       I get that you're just a little dude, without much hope in this vast Global Network of the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's all very frustrating to see the world change around you.
      </p>
      <p>
       I even can understand how you might think "those damn Jews" might be the problem in the world.  I mean, the wealthiest family in the world are Jewish descent.  Just pay no nevermind that over 90% of the 1% wealth bracket are
       <strong>
        not
       </strong>
       Jewish ... the wealthy are a cabal of the Jews.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, you're an anti-Semitic who thinks the worlds problems belong at the foot of the Zionists.   (I don't really know what that term means to
       <em>
        you
       </em>
       , but "Zionists" are the evil of the alt-right ... so I'm guessing it fits).
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway ... I'm the first to admit that the WTC bombings have very suspicious events surrounding them.  However, I don't let my
       <strong>
        confirmation bias
       </strong>
       blind me to what I don't want to see or limit it to what I do want to see.
      </p>
      <p>
       Research the insurance company put options (and not just generic insurance -&gt; specifically the company insuring the WTC) for instance.  And, how it was (I think...) Cheney/Rumsfeld or someone who had
       <em>
        millions
       </em>
       of dollars worth that were sold immediately after the bombing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Research how airplanes behave in impacts -- it wasn't the
       <em>
        "force"
       </em>
       that "
       <em>
        knocked over
       </em>
       " the towers ... they Collapsed.  Why?  ... well, that's a serious problem with the conventional story:  as Reddit loves to say "jet fuel can't melt steel beams."
      </p>
      <p>
       Research the verbal gaffs of Bush.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, there are plenty of other issues around the event ... Israel is such a non-factor that to conflate everything down to such a simplistic notion shows ... well ... honestly ... it shows a really shallow thought process.   OF COURSE Netanyahu said it's good for Israel ... because the US targets as a result of the attacks were enemies of Israel!  not to mention the increased anti-terrorist attention which would benefit US-Israeli diplomacy.
      </p>
      <p>
       anyway, get your head out of the anti-Semitic, Nationalistic, anti-Globalisation bullshit propaganda and do some research of accepted, documented facts.
      </p>
      <p>
       Start with Noam Chomsky,  Richard Dawkins, Democracy Now!, The Nation,  Mother Jones, Rolling Stone, The New York Times.

       Go to YouTube and check out footage of the TR-3B black triangle in combat in Afghanistan and Iraq.
      </p>

       </sup>
       and origins for a moment. Instead look at the footage and consider the strategic implications of the things. This is a craft with the ability to loiter above
       <em>
        and control
       </em>
       the battlefield with a 360 degree arc of fire. A single weapons platform, apparently capable of mounting howitzer-size armaments, that replaces all of the helicopters, gunships, and artillery currently used on the battlefield. If the TR-3B is real, and these are real representations of it in combat, then modern warfare has just gone through a change no less significant than those brought about by the battleship, the tank, the aircraft carrier, or the atom bomb.
      </p>
      <p>
       Speaking of The Bomb... firing nuclear weapons theoretically results in mutually assured destruction but what happens if you shoot a nuclear-powered aircraft out of the sky? An "accidental" nuclear explosion short-circuits the usual MAD mechanism, does it not? If you had a black triangle floating over your town laying down the arty, would you shoot at it knowing that it's destruction would be a nuclear fireball? A weapons platform with 360 degree battlefield control that gives defenders a MAD choice - leave it alone and be destroyed or shoot it down and not only be destroyed but also blamed for your own nuclear destruction. This is the kind of thing Admirals and Generals have been having wet dreams over for the better part of a century.
      </p>

       A friend came up with a very interesting method of propulsion after watching some of the footage: high-powered solar lasers put in orbit under the Strateghic Defense Initiative in the '80s... when sightings of these things began. The craft is silent because it has no engine and no fuel, in a traditional sense, instead diverting energy from the laser into propulsion with little to no loss. The lack of a motor and onboard fuel also reduces the weight of the craft allowing it to achieve phenomenal speeds. We have argued over whether it is manned without conclusion but a "habitation module" capable of protecting humans from the g-forces involved in such speeds would add considerable weight so I lean towards it being a drone not unlike DARPA's proposal for the SR-72: a satellite-launched drone capable of reaching speeds of Mach 20.
