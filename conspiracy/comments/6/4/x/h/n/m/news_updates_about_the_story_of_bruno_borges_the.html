        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>This <a href="http://g1.globo.com/fantastico/noticia/2017/04/fantastico-refaz-os-ultimos-passos-do-jovem-do-acre-antes-do-desaparecimento.html">investigative report</a> produced by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rede_Globo">Rede Globo</a>&#39;s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fant%C3%A1stico">Fantástico</a> released some fresh info about the ongoing mystery.</p>

<p>It reveals some interesting details about his disappearance and shows new good quality footage and also it adds new characters and sceneries to the story as they went to Rio Branco (Acre) and interviewed his family, friends and other people who played key roles in the case.</p>

<p>Altogether, it basically reports (in Brazilian Portuguese):</p>

<ul>
<li>March 27 is when it happened;</li>
<li>his room is shown and some symbols shortly explained;</li>
<li>he did it in 24 days exactly as they say;</li>
<li>his father talked about how he found the transformed room and realized his son had disappeared;</li>
<li>he left home with a bakcpack and a HD and went on foot for more than 1km;</li>
<li>15:00: he took a taxi as the driver showed the way he drove him and told he talked with someone on the phone about the destination address or something related;</li>
<li>after a 15 minutes ride, he went out of the taxi nearby a motel (last time seen), but they said he was not there;</li>
<li>however, there is a forest behind the motel where a glade is commonly used for late night gatherings, as a pedestrian told, and bonfire traces and five plastic chairs, four white ones and a red one, can be found;</li>
<li>the pedestrian also told he received invitations to join some kind of night pray or ritual around there before;</li>
<li>a dressmaker said he ordered three cloaks like the one depicted on the paintings, without the symbol, and she asked him whether it was for the church, then, he answered: &quot;almost that&quot;;</li>
<li>he later returned with a friend, tried the cloak and enjoyed it as she told while recognizing a photo of him, his friend and the painting depicting the cloak she did inspired by;</li>
<li>the friend was interviewed, he confirmed the existence of the cloak, but told he does not know about the project itself although he believes the reason of his disappearance is to spolight his work while &quot;evading or meditating&quot;;</li>
<li>a mathematician talked about the basis of cryptography as the key string, taken from <em>Junior Woodchucks Guidebook</em>, his sister found is shown and the notorious decrypted introduction and title of his book one is read: &quot;<a href="https://translate.google.com/?hl=pt#auto/en/a%20teoria%20da%20absor%C3%A7%C3%A3o%20do%20conhecimento">a teoria da absorção do conhecimento</a>&quot;;</li>
<li>the statue is highlighted;</li>
<li>he borrowed exactly R$20.000 to fund a project as his cousin personally confirmed;</li>
<li>Giordano Bruno&#39;s biography is quickly reported;</li>
<li>the peruvian sculptor behind the creation of the statue, Jorge Rivas Plata, was interviewed and explained their deal and how he sold it cheaper than it costs (R$10.000) just for admiring his project;</li>
<li>a simple count is calculated: R$20.000 - R$10.000 = R$10.000;</li>
<li>other friend who refused to be interviewed confirmed he was there with him in the room during the 24 days and that he was not eating during the days he wrote the texts all over the place;</li>
<li>another friend believes the handwritten books are his masterpiece and does not discharge the possibility of a marketing strategy;</li>
<li>a shrink talked about how he highly estimates his work and seems to think it is able to generate a revolution, besides desiring to promote it;</li>
<li>the authorities believe his friends made some kind of silence agreement regardings his groundbreaking discoveries;</li>
<li>a CCTV footage shows his last appearance running in the direction of his own home just before vanishing;</li>
<li>his sister believes he is well although she wants him back home;</li>
<li>his parents talked about their feelings about the whole thing.</li>
</ul>

<p>Other <a href="http://tv.r7.com/record-play/domingo-espetacular/videos/-misterio-envolve-o-desaparecimento-de-jovem-estudante-de-psicologia-no-acre-09042017">investigave report</a> produced by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RecordTV">RecordTV</a>&#39;s <a href="https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domingo_Espetacular">Domingo Espetacular</a> added some other details.</p>

<p>Additionally, it reports (in Brazilian Portuguese):</p>

<ul>
<li>police is investigating, but believes he left the city/state willingly;</li>
<li>his father confirms this belief by phone and discharges the possibility of a kidnapping;</li>
<li>his mother talked about his stay-at-home behavior also on the phone;</li>
<li>they always knew he would disappear after finishing his work, but, as they did not fund him in time, they are remorseful now;</li>
<li>the video in which his father did earlier to talk about the case is shown;</li>
<li>partners who are working on the case briefly explained how &quot;700 L.O.&quot; served as a clue to decrypt the notorious content of a section called &quot;<a href="https://translate.google.com/?hl=pt#auto/en/caminho%20dif%C3%ADcil">caminho difícil</a>&quot;;</li>
<li>the photo of the keyboard adaptation is shown;</li>
<li>internet discussions about the case are sampled;</li>
<li>the partners explained it is found mostly philosophy matters and questions about spacetime relation, the meaning of life and how one is supposed to leave a masterpiece as legacy;</li>
<li>the text mentioned aboved is shortly read;</li>
<li>experts on information security, psychiatry and semiotics talked about their view, respectively, claiming how easy the codes are and that he did not used proper cryptography ciphers as he simply substituted characters instead and left the key string in the room, associating it with a psychotic break by breaking with reality while exaggerating by believing too much as well as suffering grandiose delusions believing his work is a masterpiece that could change mankind, and explaining he mixed symbols from different sources with no unity as people interpretated the signs as being related with the occult, philosophy and ufology, for instance, besides the association with Giordano Bruno and the whole thing as a nowadays spectacle;</li>
<li>it states he transformed his room in just 22 days exactly while his parents were traveling and, according to his siblings, he only left the bedroom to eat during these days;</li>
<li>the internet approach is related with science fiction movies like <em>Da Vinci Code</em> and <em>Arrival</em>;</li>
<li>Giordano Bruno is shortly presented;</li>
<li>the peruvian sculptor is now working on a bust of Bruno Borges himself and it is said he charged only R$7.000;</li>
<li>hypothesis like a marketing stunt to publish the books, what his father would like to believe it is.</li>
</ul>

<p>Another <a href="http://g1.globo.com/fantastico/noticia/2017/04/em-audio-jovem-do-acre-conta-que-conseguia-sair-do-proprio-corpo-ouca.html">approach on the case</a>, from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rede_Globo">Rede Globo</a>&#39;s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fant%C3%A1stico">Fantástico</a> again, was aired and it covered some new information regarding his behavior mainly based on audio recordings and testimonials from other friends and family members.</p>

<p>Thus, it reports  (in Brazilian Portuguese):</p>

<ul>
<li>an audio recording of him talks about out-of-body/astral projection experiences he had as he explained how it happened for a friend last January;</li>
<li>the report reinforced the period of 24 days he used to achieve the transformation of his room as a sort of temple and it was precisely happening from March 1st to March 25th;</li>
<li>he took the bed out of the room, wrote all over it and convered it with varnish, then;</li>
<li>a longtime friend of him told he said he had created various copies of the texts with different levels of difficulty;</li>
<li>this same friend claimed he had taught him the meanings of the symbols present in the book XIII entitled: &quot;<a href="https://translate.google.com/?hl=pt#auto/en/ensaio%20sobre%20as%20perguntas%20sem%20resposta">ensaio sobre as perguntas sem resposta</a>&quot;;</li>
<li>he said this book talks about three basic questions: &quot;<a href="https://translate.google.com/?hl=pt#auto/en/quem%20sou%20eu%3F">quem sou eu?</a>&quot;, &quot;<a href="https://translate.google.com/?hl=pt#auto/en/qual%20o%20sentido%20da%20vida%3F">qual o sentido da vida?</a>&quot; and &quot;<a href="https://translate.google.com/?hl=pt#auto/en/h%C3%A1%20um%20deus%3F">há um deus?</a>&quot;;</li>
<li>his family is well-known in the town they live as they have some kind of concert hall and a restaurant around there;</li>
<li>during his childhood, he had an imaginary friend called &quot;<a href="https://translate.google.com/?hl=pt#auto/en/tomate">tomate</a>&quot;, which was a pillow, and his family consulted back then a paediatrician expert in mental disorders and homeopathy, but the paediatrician refused to be interviewed for ethical concerns;</li>
<li>however, his family explained the diagnosis was normal;</li>
<li>before starting studying psychology, he had tried a pilot degree, but he abandoned it before its conclusion;</li>
<li>according to his family, he read about 15 books a month;</li>
<li>the friend said he was interested in biographies and stories of great persons in order to understand where the genius comes from;</li>
<li>Giordano Bruno was his favorite and it was even depicted in the form of a statue weighing about 100kg and it is not hollow, so, there is no space where he would be able to hide inside it;</li>
<li>a reiki master explained the basis of the technique as a science original from Egypt that restarted in Japan and claimed it is all about harmony and emotional and spiritual balance;</li>
<li>his family told he studied reiki during his adolescence and even became a master on it;</li>
<li>anyway, the reiki master examined the reiki symbology left by him, found mistakes and corrected his spelling, for instance, <em>SHA</em> instead of <em>CRA</em> and <em>SHO</em> instead of <em>CHO</em> and <em>NEN</em> instead of <em>NAN</em>, according to her explanation;</li>
<li>it is claimed his family is catholic, but he turned into a spiritist although he told them he did not use to attend any spiritist center;</li>
<li>last year, he met with a physician, who knows him since his and his twin brother birth and also followed him up to his 12/13 years old, to talk about spiritism once the physician himself is a spiritist too and founded at least 8 spiritist center in their town, then, he told he heard voices of many different people telling him he had a great mission here to help mankind;</li>
<li>in January, when he had an out-of-body experience, as an audio from himself tells, he was affraid of it and tried to refuse it, but it was useless to deny;</li>
<li>the coordinator of the <a href="https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instituto_Internacional_de_Projeciologia_e_Conscienciologia">Instituto Internacional de Projeciologia e Conscienciologia</a> listened his audio and explained a little bit of astral projections and how spirits work in these grounds;</li>
<li>on an audio recording, he explained how disappointed he was with the experience itself as he would like to perform spiritual help, but could not find anything about it around there, then, lost lucidity, although it was very real for him;</li>
<li>his twin brother told he was too skinny lately and even became skinnier during the period he transformed his room as he was not eating normally;</li>
<li>he became a fruitarian one year ago and recently became a vegan as well;</li>
<li>he looked for an expert on clinical nutrition, who refused the interview, but stated his clinical exams showed he was healthy;</li>
<li>the doctor who followed him until his adolescence also told he never noticed any psychiatric abnormality among his ideas;</li>
<li>the childhood friend told he experimented Santo Daime drinking it inside an indigenous village only some few times;</li>
<li>authorities do not discharge the possibility that he went abroad, so, Interpol is warned about his disappearance;</li>
<li>anyway, investigations point that he left home willingly;</li>
<li>he had been telling he would finish the books and left his room ready, then, he would isolate himself from the world, so, even sad they believe he will later come back.</li>
</ul>

<p>Contradictions:</p>

<ul>
<li>in how many days he did it seems to be unsure, although, the period of 24 days have been better sustained;</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>he did it in <strong>24 days</strong> exactly as they say;</p>

<p>it states he transformed his room in just <strong>22 days</strong> exactly while his parents were traveling and, according to his siblings, he only left the bedroom to eat during these days;</p>

<p>the report reinforced the period of <strong>24 days</strong> he used to achieve the transformation of his room as a sort of temple and it was precisely happening from March <strong>1st to March 25th</strong>;</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>the price of the statue seems to be expensive and it had a discount, but it seems that Fantástico&#39;s report is more precise once the own sculptor said he charged only R$7.000, then, later he returned and paid more R$3.000;</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>the peruvian sculptor behind the creation of the statue, Jorge Rivas Plata, was interviewed and explained their deal and how he sold it cheaper than it costs (<strong>R$10.000</strong>) just for admiring his project;</p>

<p>the peruvian sculptor is now working on a bust of Bruno Borges himself and it is said he charged only <strong>R$7.000</strong>;</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>the CCTV footage is dated 28/03/2017, 14:29, not March 27.</li>

    <div class="md"><p>Very hard to explain/understand, indeed!</p>

<p>The weirdest detail I noticed is that the CCTV footage is dated <em>28/03/2017, 14:29</em>, not March 27; but maybe it is just a common error or something.</p>

<p>I think he is conducting a very big ritual. It takes time for him to be focused 24/7. Really not a big theory and as to what kind of ritual I have no idea. </p>

<p>It is interesting how he was fasting during these days; other news also talks he became vegetarian or vegan lately.</p>

<p>It is something that is really there for him, but I can not see what.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m from Brazil and would like to add some important information. This TV channel (Rede Globo) is the most powerful and deceitful around here, they want the first material and great information to be theirs and they appeal to sensationalist and lying information. Bruno&#39;s family helped with interviewing but after passing the material on TV, they repudiated everything and said they have a lot of information that they invented because they knew nothing and wanted an audience.</p>

<p>It seems like every english source covering this is summarizing him as an alien enthusiast. This stuff looks a lot more like ceremonial magic.

    <div class="md"><p>You are welcome, but you do not need to thank me as it is a very interesting case.</p>

<p>By the way, you said something that is really true.</p>

<p>I guess it happens because the source of the original material is mostly in Portuguese, so, internet as a whole practically estagnated on the first news collected from the case.</p>

<p>The interest of this report is that it shows minor actions that implies details of how it was done, like the word of the people who participated and places where it happened.</p>

<p>The interest of this transcription here was exactly to update the internet content base with new footage, details and info collected by strong Brazilian channels, although even they state contradictions and exaggerated hypothesis.</p>

<p>By the way, there are many fake links of supposed profiles and works made by people with his same name popping up all-around trying to impersonate him; if you are a Brazilian or understand portuguese, these attempts looks very plain and evidently fake.</p>

<p>HOWEVER, there is a cypher that no one has been able to break so far, which is rather puzzling, considering that the other ciphers were TOO simple. That cipher appears close to the drawing of a wormhole, close to the Ricci flow formula, googolplex indications, and so on.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Interesting info; if you have links or more details about it, I would like to get up to date!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Also, nobody knows who painted the pictures displayed in the room nor the meaning of the &quot;4 connected circles symbol&quot; that appear on both paintings or the meaning of many of the drawings in the room.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If I am not wrong, something I read/watched implied the painting was made by him himself just like he had learnt it from the sculptor, but I can not be sure; by the way, at the end of the first video, it talks about a friend of him who was there during the entire period, although, he did nor recorded an interview as it seems he only exchanged texts messages with the reporter or something similar.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, most of the discussion is going on in Facebook Groups and in Portuguese. Only a few people are actually focussed on trying to break the cipher. At the moment, the biggest assumption is that, comparing the language structure to the cipher, it  might be vinegere with a rather long key. There is a lot of people who think it might not even be in Portuguese at all. </p>

<p>Anyway, there&#39;s a Trello where people have been organising what&#39;s been deciphered/translated so far and what hasn&#39;t: 
<a href="https://trello.com/b/YKCHM0hD/giordano-bruno-borges">https://trello.com/b/YKCHM0hD/giordano-bruno-borges</a></p>

<p>There&#39;s also a GitHub project in Portuguese: 
<a href="https://github.com/renoirfaria/hardpath">https://github.com/renoirfaria/hardpath</a></p>

<p>And, if you want, I can give you the names of two Facebook groups where people discuss the case. </p>

<p>1) This is an artfully crafted hoax for publicity.</p>

<p>2) He had a mental break and is lost in the woods or dead.</p>

<p>3) He became involved with a fringe occult group who killed him off, intentionally or accidentally.</p>

<p>4) He coincidentally was in an accident of some sort, making the timing of his room&#39;s transformation appear to be related to his disappearance when in fact it isn&#39;t.</p>

<p>I&#39;d consider each of these equally plausible at this point.</p>

<p>I was just describing the video and details like these are supposed to work as a reference for those who do not speak Portuguese and for those who understand occult stuff as it can respect a know pattern or something.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I simply explained what the video showed and it works as a reference.</p>

<p>It was reported from an interview by phone with members of his family on the video.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What about the transmutation circle from an anime (Full metal alchemist) on the floor? That circle (although based in the studies of alchemy from the past) is a pure recreation from the fictional work. Is it a distraction? Or is this a sign that this is a hoax, and the creators took a short cot by copying something from an anime full of esoteric symbols with no purpose but esoteric aesthetics</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I guess the circle is there mainly to confuse as confusion and doubts arises from it; it seems this specific sign symbolizes, if not real alchemy, at least the confusion between the two <em>Brunos</em>, what was somehow achieved.</p>

<p>I do not think he is using it magically, but using magic concepts to deal with some meanings and drive the collective imagination as well as the cryptic texts appear to work just as an obstacle, not really to keep a secret.</p>

<p>Anyway, it is just my interpretation; nothing much.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not sure how if this illumines much but I think I know the meaning of the 22 vs 24 day discrepancy. It&#39;s probably a riddle. In antiquity the Hebrew Bible was considered to have both 22 and 24 &quot;books&quot;. Or rather, 24 works written on 22 scrolls (two of the smaller books were combined with larger books). </p>

<p>If you want more numerology, note that 22 is the number of letters in the Hebrew alphabet. It&#39;s a sacred number in Kabbalah (and its syncretic cousin Qabalah) and stands for the dimensions of space (the origin, three axes, plus the six faces and twelve lines of a cube). There are also 22 paths of light between the 10 Sefirot (attributes of God). If he&#39;s reading Giordano Bruno and J. L. Borges, he knows Kabbalah. Twenty-four is of course two times twelve, possibly signifies: the twelve tribes of Israel and twelve zodiac signs, twelve sons of Jacob plus twelve disciples of Jesus, or the twenty-four elders who surround the crystal sea in front of God&#39;s throne.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you mean there is no follow-up in this thread, it is because it is based on the transcriptions of mainstream media news reports, not actually an investigation.</p>

<p>Now, about the media itself, I guess they lost the interest as the case has been revealed and there is no substantial novelty around anymore.</p>

<p>Anyway, there is always a new report on websites like <a href="http://g1.globo.com/busca/?q=bruno+borges">G1</a>, I only do not transcribe them because it is easy for non-Portuguese speakers to translate them at the same time they are quite repetitive.</p>
