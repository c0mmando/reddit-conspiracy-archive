       All cia and nsa employees should be killed, hung on a lamp post with cardboard signs that read "traitor" on their chests.

       I've received abuses from their sick experiments. You have no idea how evil those fucking pieces of human filth are. So don't you dish out judgment of who is innocent until you've been attacked by the slimy fuckers.

       Did anyone ask Gutruid in reception when we were bombing the Nazi SS? No, and the same very much applies here.

       I felt this exact same way. So much so that I held very offensive signs outside of certain government facilities telling people they'd be the first to suffer if society fell apart because of their immoral (even if unknowing) actions against the people.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then I figured out that other dimensions are very real and our enemy isn't other human beings. As another user said you're just going to entertain the powers that be.

       I think that "they", cia types, have lost their minds, their morality, as they've been given fancy technology, no oversight, lots of money, and power... sooo... what's to stop a person?

       Trust me, the shit that happens/has happened to me is real, and there isn't isn't a fucking I can do about it, but... like some of these people are raping toddlers in DC but they get away without problems and lots of money.

       This is true. They tried to make me be a terrorist in Oklahoma, but failed, lul. They tried super hard to make it look like the life.church mega church was torturing me, while they had their doctors pump me full of Testosterone, adderal, and prozac.

       I've been on those lists for a while now. This is why I've stopped giving a fuck. They also forced me to stay in this nation.

       I literally cannot escape, unless I want to live in Mexico, and fuck that noise.

       The grass is always greener though, so maybe Russia would click at me too. Or... follow me thinking I'm an American spy or w/e.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think I can win... or just kind of live a normal life at this point. This is why I've started doing things like what happened this morning. I probably shouldn't put it down in text for the feds/cops... that's making the game a bit too easy, but it was reckless as all fuck... eh, fuck it? I mean, what are they going to do? Hack all my machines/network, follow me w/ satellites or w/e? That's already happening. Sooooo... what? What's next? I won't work for them, um, they won't go away. I'm stuck.

       They could have quit. They've had plenty of warning, and they knew.

       Did anyone ask Gutruid in reception when we were bombing the Nazi SS? No, and the same very much applies here.

       Feel free to defend them, I will hate them with every fiber of my being until my death, while I'm forced to live in this enemy nation.
