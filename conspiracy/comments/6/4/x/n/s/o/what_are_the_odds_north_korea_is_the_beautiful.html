<p>To be quite honest, I think you need to take some time away from posting in this sub. Feel free to browse and whatnot, but I really feel like you completely skipped the sidebar. I think there are some important articles and videos/documentaries found within this subs sidebar that will help you navigate this sub correctly.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think this all the time.  It&#39;s really hard not to notice, especially lately, how heavily tptb rely on TV.  So much of it is smoke and mirrors.  Would not surprise me at all if NK was a fabrication.  At the very least, frustratingly and certainly, we don&#39;t get told the whole story when it comes to NK or any other nation.  We need to find a way to break through the language barrier and organize we every day citizens and share info like we did with PG.  So when tptb start blasting shit off about Syria, Russia, NK, etc we actually have our own outlet to discuss these pieces of propaganda with our brothers from those said countries.  Obviously reddit will never let us organize again, but something like reddit that translate texts into preferred language would be a great tool for all of us</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I guess that depends on what you consider to be credible information. There are sat pictures, defectors, tourists, etc that all support the mainstream idea of what NK is, plus the fact that they don&#39;t have a presence online at all save for the few who have access to the internet.</p>

<p>I suppose if you think that the defectors/tourists are staged and satellite pictures are faked then this could be a possibility, but I&#39;d say that it&#39;s highly unlikely that this is the case. I think someone would&#39;ve spilled the beans by now</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We can&#39;t organize and share ideas yet a lot of Americans will believe that we are free. The issue is the bar is set far too low for humanity as a whole and we talk in.degrees...like NK is less free than us, so we have reason to bomb them while we ignore the fact that we ourselves are not free. I bet us and NK citizens would get along just fine. It is our governments both here and in the NK that need to be abolished </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure you can.</p>

<p>It just takes a lot of work and dedication.</p>

<p>Most people aren&#39;t into that much work and dedication.</p>

<p>When we worked on passing SB215 in California it was a full second job.</p>

<p>We had roadblocks and opposition everywhere, but eventually we were able to begin the process to change laws in that state.</p>

<p>It still took another decades for our ultimate goal to be realized, and even then there is likely another lifetime of work culturally and politically before solid change really occurs.</p>

<p>This is the issue with non-violent revolution, it is slow. Equal rights, free use, speech, congregation; all take time. And if we&#39;re not safeguarding them by being active in our political system then those who are will change those laws to suit themselves.</p>

<p>The alternative of violent revolution is one where we trust that a charismatic leader with complete power will have our best interest at heart. The track record for this has been terribly poor in human history.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There was a video on youtube recently that an American made illegally and put it on youtube. It was like a short homemade video. There was tons of kids in like the town square and they was flying kits and appeared to be having fun. The dude filming thought it would be funny to do a handstand. The guides ran over and told him to delete the pictures now. 
Anyway its probably not as bad as we are told. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>A lot of them are claimed to be actors. You can pay to take a tour through the parts of NK they want you to see and you&#39;ll see a lot of people well dressed, fed and overall looking happy while the tourists are there. </p>

<p>You&#39;ll also see dozens of people standing on the train platform as If they have somewhere to actually be and stores stocked full of food and electronics that you can&#39;t actually inspect. </p>

<p>I find it highly unlikely it&#39;s some utopia paradise they are hiding from us. As it would&#39;ve been concquered years ago by the greedy elites. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You should watch the Netflix documentary Under the Sun. </p>

<p>It was made with the approval and supervision of the North Korean government, but what the documentarians left in were the parts they were supposed to cut. You see how the NK government stages everything from schoolyards, to factories, to people placing flowers. </p>

<p>North Korea claimed the intent of the film was to be a &quot;documentary&quot; about a little girl, but in actuality there had been a script written beforehand and we actually see how they set the stage for these types of &quot;documentaries&quot; </p>
