        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Can someone explain why they believe the Saturn Moon matrix theory? Or if it&#39;s a red herring but with some truth?
Stuff about sacred geometry, chakras, astral stuff, etc.
What connection does this stuff have with holy books?
Does &quot;Magick&quot; actually exist? If so, is it the manipulation of the matrix? Does that make it satanic or not necessarily?
Or this all a bunch of nonsense?
I would prefer some open minded discussion though. :)</p>

<p>Were holy books written to spread the truth in a hidden format?
Or was it just a tool for mass population control?
Or something else?
Stuff like meditation can&#39;t be &quot;satanic&quot; can it? That&#39;s a claim I&#39;ve heard before,
and it&#39;s difficult to believe lol.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m mostly interested in this David Icke theory because it seems to tie together lots of coincidences and occultic stuff.
From what I&#39;ve seen (symbolism) I can conclude
either the elite are religious nuts, psychopaths or
have some kind of &quot;suppressed knowledge&quot;. Maybe all the above...</p>

<p>I&#39;m somewhat skeptical about this stuff but still curious.
I don&#39;t know what connection these things have to ancient Egypt and the Khazars
but surely there&#39;s no smoke without fire.
Why would the wealthy bullshit themselves about some occultic crap?
If I&#39;m understanding correctly, freemason stuff (not sure if mason and freemason are the same thing or not...)
isn&#39;t really about workmanship like people claim, but probably more likely
to be something about knowing sacred geometry since
the freemason logo has a G for God/geometry/Great architect of the universe.</p>

<p>Is the &quot;Lord&quot; in the Bible Satan while God is God?
Very confusing to me, especially as I&#39;m not religious.
Damn, holy books, why you no speak non-cryptic English!!?</p>

<p>The deeper you get into conspiracies, the more
you start to think random stuff like the Bermuda triangle, satanism,
corporations, Atlantis, Babylon, etc. are all linked in some way.
But I don&#39;t want to run before I walk, so I&#39;m waiting for some replies
from people who might know something I don&#39;t about this subject.
If this Saturn Moon matrix theory is true, 
can&#39;t we cancel out the deceptive signal wave with an anti wave
via destructive interference (physics concept)?
I also wonder how time is involved in all this
and if &quot;born in sin = born in sine wave, as in time&quot;
has some truth in it or just someone connecting dots that aren&#39;t meant to be connected.</p>

I considered him controlled opposition due to the reptillian stuff but
to remain truly critical, you have to entertain an idea and wait for it expose itself as a falsehood.
Nothing is off the table for me, until it&#39;s truly disproven.
Sometimes fact is stranger than fiction.
I&#39;m still on the fence about this theory.
The occultic stuff is either crazy shit bored elites fantasize about,
or it&#39;s actually suppressed knowledge. That&#39;s my view.</p>

like making a dirty coin (placed inside) shiny again.
I read beforehand that skeptics are less successful so
I took that into account but the experiment failed after a month of waiting.
Do you think I had a false belief?
Or a flaw in methodology?
Or both?
How can you truly believe something blindly

Sounds impossible. :/</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You could try doing it without knowing your direction and timing (disorientated/lost, blindfolded, maybe having the same smell in front of you at all times like essential oils or something if it doesn&#39;t affect the experiment)
and having someone who doesn&#39;t believe you, guide you in random directions
until randomly the area is stepped into
so you can tell if it&#39;s the subconscious or some stranger phenomenon.</p>

<p>The subconscious probably can&#39;t do much without enough sensory data,
so if the test is successful, it could indicate the subconscious was not involved.
Just an idea. I wonder if someone&#39;s already done something like this.
It reminds me of when I wonder
if I can feel a laser beam on my palm or if it&#39;s just my mind playing along lol.</p>

At the very least, I&#39;d say to check out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PobdOkG0yOg">How Astrology Has Influenced Religion</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddHfU2wKvmc">Initiation Of The Pyramid</a> which talks about initiation rites that took place in the Great Pyramid</p>

Have any resources I could look at to go deeper?
Any kind of proofs or circumstantial evidence that

(They can still be psychotic, even if occultism is based in reality.)
Is there not a way to break the signal or is it not literally a wave?
Otherwise I would have thought destructive interference could have been used to end the illusion.
Or is it a wave from another dimension? (Difficult concept to get my head around about stuff to do with dimensions and the electromagnetic spectrum.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay, lemme share some of my findings with you.</p>

<p>Basically Saturn is a deity which represents Karma cycle. Saturnalia was the harvest for the seeds you have planted and that&#39;s why Saturn is represented with the cicle.</p>

<p>David icke&#39;s theory is basically the following. Let&#39;s say here are the color and sound spectrum: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 which objectively exists. According to him what Saturn does is cuts it massively and humanity only sees and hears let&#39;s say 4 5 6 without any idea about others. Now to further develop this theory what if every human is already more than 3 Dimensional being by it&#39;s nature but Saturn/It&#39;s Cube is blocking all the other perceptions except for the ones which are experienced in matter. </p>

<p>Here we must go to astrological and religious parts. As you know there 12 signs of zodiac and 12 zodiacal eras which go in reverse to each other and which are also a cycle. Planet Earth was in Astrological Era of Taurus before the &quot;Old testament&quot; period and hence there were a lot of Taurus/Golden Bull/ Baal worship. Once Earth moved from Taurus to Aries started the Old testament period. 
That was the moment YHWH appeared in scriptures and he was considered the God of Israel. Aries is pretty much modern day Baphomet representation. Later since the new testament earth switched from Aries to Piesces but let&#39;s skip that for now.</p>

<p>As you know according to Greek myths Saturn has killed his farther Ouranos and started to rule since then until Zeus/Jupiter survived and killed Saturn.  </p>

<p>Here is the planetary representation:</p>

<p><a href="https://previews.123rf.com/images/jethita/jethita1606/jethita160600037/58762864-Solar-system-set-of-planets-Mercury-Venus-Earth-Mars-Jupiter-Saturn-Uranus-Neptune-Pluto-Space-illus-Stock-Vector.jpg">https://previews.123rf.com/images/jethita/jethita1606/jethita160600037/58762864-Solar-system-set-of-planets-Mercury-Venus-Earth-Mars-Jupiter-Saturn-Uranus-Neptune-Pluto-Space-illus-Stock-Vector.jpg</a></p>

<p>It occurs so that with each zodiacal era switch humanity worship changed from one planet to another. The current one is in era of Jupiter.</p>

<p>However for some reason jews for example would not like to accept this switches and they keep worshipping Saturn on their sacred day Saturn/day while Christian worship Sun on Sunday and Muslims worship Moon and live according to Moon calendar Moonday.</p>

<p>YHWH, God of Jews is represented in macrocosm as Saturn but planet itself probably is not the only part of it. </p>

<p>This can be further developed surely as Israel is ISIS(water) + RA(sun energy) + EL(AIR), basically these are three elements which are necessary for your existence, holy trinity. If you search for some of current scientific results oxygen is what causes people to age and get old but I am not sure about it personally however it is an interesting concept.</p>

<p>Satanic basically equals material. Material is illusional. That&#39;s why everything material dies and cannot be taken with you after your death. IF you try to think for a second right now that you are going to die for example tomorrow then everything what bothers you right now would be very silly.</p>

<p>However, there are also different assumptions. The problem is that humanity always tries to split everything in two, if God is Christ than there antiGod is Satan, if God is YHWH then antiGod is Lucifer, if God is Absolute then antiGOD is YHWH and it goes on and on.</p>

<p>Questions like &quot;meditation can&#39;t be satanic?&quot; are obviously represent that you at the very beginning of your journely. Let&#39;s say that the only think which you can carry out with you after your life is knowledge, memory and wisdom, so everything which makes you
more knowledgable is good for you despite any believes you have.
You just have to study a lot and not accept anything blindly.</p>

<p>I am a bit tired of typing for this specific point of discussion. There are a lot of additional information I can share but not right now.</p>

<p>As for mathematics it is probably a representation of universal language which is self-sufficient. Let&#39;s say that if I tell you &quot;square&quot;
or &quot;cube&quot; you need an image way of decoding this words. However if
I simply write 3<em>3</em>3 you may fairly easily interpret that as a cube.</p>

<p>Now numbers are also quite mysterious by it&#39;s nature. We are being taught that it is used simply to calculate stuff and write it on paper
however everything which surrounds us basically consists of numbers and scientists do not invent anything but simply find out
new ways as they deepen their knowledge.</p>

<p>That&#39;s all quite a lot of information and require so effort to study. I am personally quite at the beginning of the journey so I hope at least some of this info is helpful for you.</p>

away from the more imminent issues of politics, corporate corruption, etc. 
But it still may be wise to stay on the fence on this one
since there&#39;s enough symbolism to be suspicious of its significance.
Although, as you suggest, it could also be distracting disinfo.

    <div class="md"><p>Let me share with you something easily supernatural. Let&#39;s it all pile of crap. Do you believe that humans have souls? If not then that&#39;s scientifically not possible for me to imagine how do you think your complete disappearance would occur. </p>

<p>If you do believe that human have souls then vagina is the supernatural portal. Why? because everyone with the consiousness is getting born through vagina. There is no other way for any soul to enter this world but through female vagina. At which point soul gets attached to the semen inside women? Do you know? I do not. That&#39;s fairly easy to take the concept that 2 parts of semen get together and form a human but at which point soul come into this world? So, if you try to read what I wrote at least several times and look at it in specific perspective you will understand what I am saying. Vagina is a portal for souls to enter material plane despite how silly it can sound. If you find any soul which have entered this planet without vagina let me know.</p>

Assuming no one is lying, shilling, exaggerating, delusional, etc.,
we can&#39;t reasonably say
&quot;person X who claims they experienced many weird stuff in their life&quot;
had a less valid experience than
&quot;person Y who claims they experienced NO weird stuff at all in their life&quot;.</p>

<p>If both are truthful and correct,
neither are invalid, as it is possible for
one person to experience strange phenomena (without normal explanations)
and another person to go years without strange occurances or not noticing them.</p>

<p>Obviously, if some people are lying, shilling, delusional, etc.
then one person&#39;s argument is invalid,
but it&#39;s difficult to tell when there is no hard evidence on either side.
There are logical arguments on both sides but it&#39;s not enough
to come to a conclusion for now.</p>

<p>Saturn Moon matrix theory</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Most of David Icke&#39;s theories seem to start off solid and then latch onto very specific conclusions with little evidence.</p>

<p>The idea we live in a controlled simulation is pretty well established across religions and science. But the idea that Saturn and the Moon are responsible doesn&#39;t have much evidence. It seems more logical that the entire 3D universe is the simulation or prison to keep us from seeing actual reality.</p>

<p>Similarly, the idea there are meta-physical entities: Christians call them angels and demons, Gnostics call them Archons, UFOlogists call them interdimensional aliens. But Icke insists they&#39;re reptilians, which seems even less credible than calling them aliens.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been in a meditative state and seen an evil green thing with big eyes, so I get how people can interpret this as aliens or reptilians. I think Archon devil-god makes a better framework for understanding than Icke&#39;s framework, though.</p>

<p>The people who rule this world believe it does. You can break magick into two parts, in my view. Directly and consciously affecting the outcome of the world (sigils, spells, etc.) and summoning something metaphysical that can help you affect the world (e.g. prayer, Satanism). </p>

<p>Taking the bible as an example, I think it started with a lot of truth. Then people added a lot of dogma and myth that were made up. Then a bunch of pedophile priests spent centuries editing it into a population control tool so they could tell you to obey them or you&#39;d go to hell.</p>

<p>Meditation is basically prayer, and prayer is a form of magick. If you pray to god or for something good, it&#39;s not Satanic. If you pray to Satan or meditate to manifest Satan for evil purposes, it&#39;s Satanic.</p>

<p>Magick is all about intent.</p>
