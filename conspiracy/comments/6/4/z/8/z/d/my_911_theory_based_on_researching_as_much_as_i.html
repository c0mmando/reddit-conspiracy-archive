       This is a post requested by many after a comment chain in a different thread. I'll keep this as concise as possible (but my apologies if it's lengthyish...I'm really passionate about this/have done so many hours of research) and I will put links at the bottom for reference as needed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Before I begin, I want to note that I have researched countless hours of credible and bogus theories/videos/articles/etc...I think it's important to look at both sides of something before formulating your opinion. I will try to present the information as clearly as possible.
       <strong>
        My suggestion is to read all of what I post here, then go through and watch the links/videos and do your own research...it's absolutely worth the time invested.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, I want to say the absolute BEST link to research what happened to the towers is "Architects &amp; Engineers for 9/11 Truth" ... these people are the most qualified to explain what happened from a purely scientific standpoint.

       My theory is that the US had some knowledge of what was going to happen and helped carry it out. This was a well-thought out mission to deceive the American people (and world) to justify retaliation and
       <em>
        make money
       </em>
       . It was carried out by the US, Israel, &amp; (perhaps) Saudi Arabia. I say this because:

         Israeli "art students" had the ENTIRE 91 and 92 floor of at least one tower. They are seen in multiple photos with countless empty boxes (that literally have the short-hand name for various explosives on the outside of the box) lining the walls. They also have grappling gear, construction passes (so they can access any and all of each WTC), and most disturbing of all are the detailed drawings of the WTC structure with very cryptic coded language

         There were absolutely planes used. No holograms/fake planes/no planes. However, they were not highjacked. This was absolutely a lie by our government (they conveniently found a passport ON 9/11 IN THE STREET from a "highjacker" yet 99% of everything else was destroyed) The list of hijackers we were told was actually refuted by people on the list who were living peacefully in other countries

(there's a better link somewhere about the flight paths of these planes and how one caused an issue at an airport while it was de-boarded...i can't find the link, i'll post it later on when I do, but here's one about the drones/eyewitnesses about the planes)

         People absolutely died on 9/11. The dummies/fake jumpers theory is not true. People jumped because they couldn't breathe/were trapped. It is horrifying to learn about their stories, specifically those trapped in the towers. Here is a video of calls made from people in the towers to their families...some only got an answering machine.

         Towers were demolished. NOTHING left. There should have been mountains of steel, concrete, furniture, countless bodies (it is truly saddening to see the interviews of the firefighters talking about not finding any bodies but sometimes finding pieces of bones/etc). Molten steel burning for months under ground. Not sure what it was, but whatever they used to blow the towers was designed to absolutely destroy everything.

        CONCLUSION
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       I wasn't there when this attack happened, but I remember it vividly and somehow feel connected to it. I also remember immediately questioning how BOTH towers fell, especially in the way they did. I got more into the "conspiracy" research once I found out about WTC7. I'm not an expert or a crazy person...I'm just someone who is passionate about this, and cares about informing others that what we are "told" is often not "reality." It really changes your worldview once you realize that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thanks for taking the time to read this. I wanted to include more but it's honestly never-ending. I respect everyone's opinion's on this whether you agree with my view or not, and I hope this can be used to respectfully discuss and inform each other and others.

       Based on all the research available that I've done, i would tend to agree to an extent: Israeli operatives carried out the destruction of the World Trade Center with help from elements of our government (the neocons).

       I don't believe a plane hit the pentagon.  The evidence is not there.  Most likely a bomb or missle was set to destroy revealing documents or to kill possible whistleblowers.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you remember that day, the media intended for us to believe that the whole country was under attack.  While we focus on the big daddies of WTC, we don't focus as much on the Pentagon or the Pennsylvania incident.

       IMO, There was enough debris for a passenger plane once you consider that aluminium basically pancakes if it runs into something solid.
The aluminium basically extruded through the holes between the steel beams and that's why you see so much debris once everything actually falls down/apart.
 The reason why it could have been less damage then the trade towers (where they bent the steel beams at the bolts) was because it was closer to the ground and more reinforced. The hole size was from retracted steel landing gear.

       I agree with you that a plane didn't hit it. It was a bomb or missile of some sort. There are eye witness accounts of a plane coming down low near the Pentagon then rising up and flying off after the explosion.
      </p>
      <p>
       The most obvious reason I'll never believe it was a plane was because of the size of the hole/damage. Makes zero sense to say it was a plane. (Also, fun fact, there's video out there showing the debris from the "plane" leftover and how it could NOT have been from the plane they say it was because that equipment was never made for it and only for a different type of craft)

       Missile hits Pentagon. A missile is also used to shoot Flight 93. That way if people start hearing about missiles in a conspiracy theory, they get led towards Flight 93 instead of Pentagon. Americans could stomach a conspiracy about covering up shooting down Flight 93 for the good of the nation, in fact many would approve of that and understand the reason for covering it up.

       While they did say on the news in London that WTC7 has collapsed this is not because the media had prior knowledge. Before WTC7 collapsed several fireman and policeman were clearing people away from the tower saying the building was coming down. This happened nearly an hour before the actual collapse and news had then began circulating that the tower was about to collapse. The newscasters in London, not being familiar with the background, reported that the building had already collapsed.

       You're right they couldn't have predicted it, what I'm saying is that the rescue workers clearing people out were the ones predicting the building would come down, and those newscasters were reporting from that, but no one ever explained how they knew the building was coming down in time to clear people out.

        At approximately 2:00 pm, firefighters noticed a bulge in the southwest corner of 7 World Trade Center between the 10th and 13th floors, a sign that the building was unstable and might collapse. During the afternoon, firefighters also heard creaking sounds coming from the building. Around 3:30 pm, FDNY Chief Daniel A. Nigro decided to halt rescue operations, surface removal, and searches along the surface of the debris near 7 World Trade Center and evacuate the area due to concerns for the safety of personnel.

       I clearly remember this; watched the damn news all day and around late afternoon the message started going around that WTC7 was "coming down" and was going to be "pulled." This was a general talking point throughout the day (I assume a plane was supposed to hit 7 as well; can't have EVERYTHING go 100% in an operation of this level of complexity I guess).
      </p>
      <p>
       It seemed curious at the time but, like everyone, I was in a state of general disbelief and just went with the program.
      </p>
      <p>
       But WTF did they mean by "pulled"? Unless they had a team of demo experts on-hand to rig up a controlled demo this makes no sense (and is physically impossible anyway). Why would experts in fire science and structural engineering assume that a common office fire would take down a heavily fortified steel frame building? It wasn't the only building "hit by debris." Then the NIST report...
      </p>
      <p>
       The evidence is clear now: there is NO WAY that an office fire brought down WTC7. I'm sure your research has led you to this video which is without question the one that fully redpilled me:

       The hologram planes theory feels like a psyop; there is too much wild speculation there for me and it is definitely a divide and conquer tactic. I lean towards plane-swapping, drone hits (drones that were capable of low-altitude maneuvers impossible by commercial planes) and Pentagon missile strike.

       I never questioned that there were planes used until I found out that according to the "official version" not 1 not 2 but all 4 planes exceeded their maximum operating velocities at sea level. Humans can travel very fast at normal levels because the air is thin enough for us to move through. However if we go the same speed underwater we'd probably get our arms ripped off. So airplanes cant travel as fast as they do at a normal cruising altitude at sea level, otherwise the plane would be ripped apart, yet we all saw a plane hit the tower completely undamaged. Also you mentioned the phone calls, one theory about this is that the planes took off and were switched in midair with military aircraft then landed at a base. The CIA has been running exercises that attempt to switch civilian planes without detection since the 60's. This opens up the disturbing possibility that the people who made calls to their relatives from their cell phones were forced to make those calls under duress. This is supported by flight attendant CeeCee Lyles call, where at the end she whispers 3 words that sound like "it's a frame".

       ooo i forgot about that call. man. it's hard to listen to some of the calls from that day. one of the most horrific audio i've ever heard was from a guy trapped in a tower on the line with the police AS the towers fell. I can link it if you want, but I'm warning you it's intense.

       For me it was the Bush/Cheney refusing to go under oath, and to only do testimony off the record, and together.  Bush's body language in the days just before this when asked was very revealing.  He was very, very nervous and it showed.

       Yeah, that was a nugget on the scale for me. But I thought it might just generally be about covering up incompetence or mild malfeasance. When you hear "It's a frame!" that puts things in a whole different reality. Or "reality."

       Lee Harvey Oswald was being brought into the jail when a reporter asked him if he killed the president. He replied over his shoulder as they were whisking him away from them, "I'm only the patsy."  I don't think Oswald realized that until he was arrested. But he said it on live television.

       Yes, I absolutely blame them.  They are paid whores and understand what is really happening.  I don't mean your average reporter.  I mean the upper echelon.  They know what the truth is, and have made the conscious decision to hide that truth.  They are just as culpable, if not more so because truth telling is their one function.  Look up Edward R. Murrow, and WAKE UP!

       Hey, you know what happened to Canadian Conrad Black, the huge  multimedia owner? (at the time)
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Conrad Moffat Black, Baron Black of Crossharbour, KSG (born 25 August 1944) is a British former newspaper publisher and author. He is a non-affiliated life peer.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Black is a former Steering Committee member of the Bilderberg Group.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Black controlled Hollinger International, once the world's third-largest English-language newspaper empire,  which published The Daily Telegraph (UK), Chicago Sun-Times (U.S.), The Jerusalem Post (Israel), National Post (Canada), most of the leading newspapers in Australia and Canada and hundreds of community newspapers in North America, before he was fired by the board of Hollinger in 2004.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        In November 2000, CAI-Carlyle arranged a $3.4 billion predatory loan to persuade Black into selling Hollinger's Canadian media assets to CanWest Global Communications.
       </li>
      </ul>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Carlyle investors then appear to have set up an ambush for Black by paying him a number of $ million checks through the First National Bank of Chicago againstU.S. non-compete agreements, arranged by David Radler and his crony lawyers.

Over $80 million in assets were alleged to have been improperly taken and/or spent by Black.[5] He was convicted of three counts of fraud and one count of obstruction of justice in a U.S. court in 2007 and sentenced to six and a half years' imprisonment.
       </p>
       <p>
        In 2011, two of the charges were overturned on appeal and he was re-sentenced to 42 months in prison on one count of mail fraud and one count of obstruction of justice.[6] Black was released on 4 May 2012, after serving 37 months in prison

       No offense, but that's kind of embarrassing.  It's vague and questionable circumstantial evidence.  Just because it seems like something spooky out of a movie doesn't make it profound or true.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's emotional susceptibility like this that leads people to believe the official story, or to create nonsensical conspiracy theories that take away credibility from the actual scientific evidence.

       Fair enough answer. But it's also emotion that can keep people from accepting facts, and then a counter-push on emotions can tip them back the other way.

       It wasn't merely the phone recording. It was the phone recording on top of everything else. Because....we've heard from NO ONE ELSE who was actually there, have we?

       i could be wrong, but i do believe these were publically available downloads at a time. If i remember right, first the story was that these phonecalls were made on cell phones, then once that came into disrepute (as it wasn't technologically possible at the time), they switched to plane phones being used. So all plane calls were available to download. I haven't read up on this is a good couple of years so that may be a bit wrong lol

       Too much conjecture for a simple discrepancy.  The simplest reason is usually the best assumption:
      </p>
      <p>
       The planes actually
       <em>
        were
       </em>
       swapped out with drones, but the drones were identical jets (why would the perpetrators risk anything else? The entire point was for it to look REAL.  Faster planes are completely unnecessary/risky).
       <strong>
        The mistake was made when the black box information had to be fabricated, and the people doing it didn't do enough homework (left plotholes)

       If you listen to the NORAD tapes, this is not what happened. Cheney is the guy who gave the order to shoot down the planes. The DOD was not sure if the Vice President had the authority to order US airplanes to be shot down.  In fact the order was 'denied' by a general.  When Cheney was asked if the order still stands, and he flips out, the order he is saying stands is the order to shoot down US citizens.

       According to the transcripts concerning AA 11, the hijacking is reported to North Eastern Air Defense at around 0826.  The fighter jets are scrambled to Otis at 0846. The time WTC 1 was hit.   These jets established Combat Air Parameter over NYC.   The rest of the story does not make sense. Jets went out from Langley and got to Washington around the time the Pentagon was bombed.   There were 3 reported crash sites. United 93 in Pennsylvania,  a crash in Kentucky and a crash North East of Camp David.  It is within the realm of possibility that something was shot down.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, people on the tapes at NORAD, asked a legitimate question.  Does the VP have the authority to authorize and order the military to shoot down US citizens  over US soil.   It is not clear to me that  they officially made the wrong decision by saying NO! The VP can't order US Military to shoot down US citizens over American soil!

       The Pentagon got attacked at 09:36 +/- 1 to 2 min depending on the source.  The official cause of the attack was AA 77.  Flight United Airlines 93 was suspected of heading towards Washington. This is the flight that 'crashed' in Pennsylvania in the official narrative.  The order still stands is referring to the order to shoot down the planes that Cheney gave.   Cheney gives this order referring to United 93, which was believed to head towards Washington.

       Mineta responds to an opening question by Commissioner Hamilton about the events in the PEOC and an alleged shoot down order. He describes a conversation between Cheney and a young man:
      </p>
      <p>
       Mineta: “During the time that the airplane was coming into the Pentagon, there was a young man who would come in and say to the Vice President…the plane is 50 miles out…the plane is 30 miles out….and when it got down to the plane is 10 miles out, the young man also said to the vice president “do the orders still stand?” And the Vice President turned and whipped his neck around and said “Of course the orders still stand, have you heard anything to the contrary!??”
      </p>
      <p>
       Mineta explains that while he had not known it at the time, he had surmised that the standing order the young man asked about must have been a shoot down order. Hamilton, looking a bit confused, seeks clarification about which flight the conversation was regarding, and Mineta once again clarifies that it is the flight that hit the Pentagon at 9:37 a.m. on September 11. There was good reason for the quizzical expression on Hamilton’s face. Secretary Mineta had thoroughly trashed previous accounts of the PEOC activities that had been published in the press. In a CNN piece dated 9/11/02, the timing of events had been represented differently. According to CNN:
      </p>
      <p>
       “After the planes struck the twin towers, a third took a chunk out of the Pentagon. Cheney then heard a report that a plane over Pennsylvania was heading for Washington. A military assistant asked Cheney twice for authority to shoot it down.”
      </p>
      <p>
       In the CNN piece Cheney aid Josh Bolton describes the same exchange between Cheney and the young man that Mineta did, but Bolton ties the exchange to “a report that a plane over Pennsylvania was heading for Washington”. This is the official White House legend, the one adopted in the White House produced 9/11 Commission Report, the one exposed by Mineta. Hamilton follows with a question about Flight 93:
      </p>
      <p>
       Hamilton: “With respect to flight 93, what type of information were you and the Vice President receiving about that flight.”
      </p>
      <p>
       Mineta: “The only information we had at that point, was when it crashed.”
      </p>
      <p>
       Chairman Kean then stresses that the Secretary’s time is limited. He moves to Commissioner Roemer, who, immediately prior to his questioning appears to be receiving counsel.

       Thanks for this... it is all so very convoluted! It would be valuable to have the actual transcript of Mineta's testimony.  This is complicated because it appears that the information that the Pentagon was hit by AA 77 actually comes from a tactical net started by the CIA and joined by the white house.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is good evidence that Cheney gave the order to shoot down planes, that was questioned and denied.   Mineta's testimony would seem to implicate him in a different order.  Cheney needs to be under oath and be questioned about this!!!

        <p>
         Why did the events of 911 happen on 911? Was this a "date specific" event?
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Yes, the event was specific to 9/11/2001.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       911 happened on 911 because on 9/12/2001 two hundred and forty billion dollars in fraudulent securities became due and payable by the US treasury and paying those securities would have exposed the necessary links in 100s of massive, global international money laundering schemes and 100s of elected and non-elected officials would have gone to prison based on 100s of current and ongoing investigations at that time. Evidence of money laundering, arms sales, drug sales, violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and many more crimes were destroyed forever.
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         100s of elected and non-elected officials would have gone to prison?
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Yes. The FBI, the CIA, the SEC, Customs, the Secret Service, IRS, the Office Of Naval Intelligence, banking regulators and global intelligence organizations as well as a number of other government agencies were tracking the money laundering activities related to gold market manipulation and global international money laundering. The "Eldorado Task Force" was a group of 55 intergovernmental agencies devoted to investigating international money laundering. These investigations all began after 1989 and were tracking years of fraudulent but very sophisticated money laundering schemes. ALL investigations were immediately halted on 9/12/2001 because not only was ALL of the evidence destroyed but 100s of the government and non-government investigators were also killed.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Did anything unusual happen on 9/12/2001?
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Yes. For the first time in US history the Federal Reserve cleared 240 billion dollars in securities ANONYMOUSLY thanks to the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Securities and Exchange Commission invoked its emergency powers under SEC Act Section 12(k) and eased regulatory restrictions for the clearance of international securities on 9/11/2001. Think about that. The Federal Reserve allowed an anonymous individual or individuals to be paid 240 billion dollars in US denominated funds without revealing their names, location or legal status. As a result of the events of 911 George Bush, the SEC and the Federal Reserve approved the dispensing of "Securities Clearance" laws, for less then 15 days, a presidential approved breach of National Security, for the first time in history.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Why did George Bush and the Federal Reserve do this?
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         In 1989 a scheme was devised to end the Cold War and destroy the Soviet Union. The plan included crashing the currency and thus the economy, buying up the Soviet infrastructure at pennies on the dollar and leaving the Soviet Union a shell of its former self. The plan worked. In order to promote a sophisticated plan to crash the economy of the Soviet Union a massive amount of money was needed and the Federal Reserve, the SEC and with the blessings of George Bush, approved the counterfeiting of 240 billion dollars in bearer bonds, commonly referred to as Brady Bonds. This scheme was covered fully under "National Security." There were 4 parts to this "National Security" scheme:
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       a. Theft of the Soviet Treasury
      </p>
      <p>
       b. Currency Destabilization of the Ruble
      </p>
      <p>
       c. Funding the KGB Generals 1991 coup against Gorbachev
      </p>
      <p>
       d. Takeover of key Soviet energy and defense industries by Western powers
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         What exactly did they do once the bonds were floated?
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Using various global intelligence assets, foreign banks and large international corporations with off-shore accounts, like Enron, but many others, they destroyed the Russian Ruble causing its value to plunge. They then bought oil, gas, steel and commodities exporters, major technological institutions and water, electric and agricultural firms within the Soviet Union. By buying up the infrastrusture (energy and defense) and then selling off the assets the economic viability of the Soviet Union was destroyed.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         What were the 3 primary reasons for 911?
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The first and foremost reason for the events of 911 was to conceal the identities of the 100s of intelligence assets, international bankers, elected officials and international players involved in the demise of the Soviet Union and to prevent the exposure of a "National Security" event, the destruction of the Soviet Union. The 2nd reason behind the events of 911 was to end for all time the ongoing investigations by numerous government and non-government organizations into these money laundering and gold market manipulations. The 3rd reason behind 911 was to provide the cover to allow for vilification of Islam and for blame to be placed on Islamic Fundamentalists allowing for public opinion to support extended wars to acquire global petroleum and mining resources.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Were the several planes targeting specific locations?
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Yes. Each plane on 911 had specific targets all of which were hit with great precision. There were 3 major securities brokers in the Twin Towers, Cantor Fitzgerald (largest in US), Eurobrokers and Garbon Intercapital. Flight 11 hit the North Tower right below the offices of Cantor Fitzgerald destroying all records of securities transactions. Cantor Fitzgerald was the primary target. Flight 175 hit the South Tower below the offices of Eurobrokers and while this all took place massive explosions were reported in the North Tower under FBI offices on the 23rd floor and under Garbon Intercapital on the 25th floor again destroying any and all securities records. Flight 77 hit the Pentagon targeting the Office Of Naval Intelligence where investigators were working on illegal international financial schemes based out of the offices of Cantor Fitzgerald, Eurobrokers and Garbon Intercapital. Flight 77 not only destroyed all records related to these investigations but it also killed 39 of the 40 Naval Intelligence Investigators. The flight that crashed in Pennsylvania missed its target, building 7. All certificates for US bonds and other securities were completly destroyed.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Since this was a murder are there clues if we examine the fatalities?
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Yes. Forty-One percent of the fatalities in the Twin Towers came from the two corporations that managed US government securities, Cantor Fitzgerald and Eurobrokers. Thirty-One percent of the fatalities at the Pentagon were from the Naval Command Center that housed the office of Naval Intelligence where 39 of 40 investigators were killed.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         How is this cover-up maintained?
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The event was a "National Security" event. Anyone connected whether media or elected officials are given the excuse that "National Security" is and was at stake and that's all that needs to be said. 911 hides the purposeful destruction of the Soviet Economy, massive crimes attached to that, and the need for a massive crime to cover up these massive crimes.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Who was involved?
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         I'm going to list the major players in no specific order. Please remember, the events of 911 were designed to cover up illegal global international financial activity by many people, both elected and non-elected, whose privileged lives were about to go up in smoke, whose pampered lifestyles would have, if not for 911, been reduced to a life in prison. In essence, 911 was a National Security event designed to cover other National Security events, or, depending upon your perspective, a massive crime to cover even more massive crimes.

       These people referred to themselves as the "Vulcans." The covert operations conducted by the Vulcans involved - at a minimum - securities fraud, money laundering and violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. In a number of cases murder and false imprisonment (see Leo Wanta) seemed to be the mainstay of efforts to prevent any remorseful participants from going public with their stories. While accomplishing the objective - bringing about the demise of the Soviet Union - the scheme also seems to have lined the pockets of the individuals that executed the policies at US taxpayer expense.

       If all of these agencies were investigating the money laundering, how did they manage to destroy all of the evidence by bringing down 3 buildings and putting a hole in the Pentagon?  Surely there were duplicates elsewhere, or at least ancillary evidence collected by each independent entity.

       Because the theory makes no sense, and is a shitty conspiracy. Immediately, the first statement about Cantor Fitzgerald being the largest broker in the US is false. Second, all firms have digital records stored elsewhere to avoid the very issue of destruction. Anyone who knows anything about finance knows this is totally bonkers.

       Money laundering is the process of transforming the profits of crime and corruption into ostensibly 'legitimate' assets. In a number of legal and regulatory systems, however, the term money laundering has become conflated with other forms of financial and business crime, and is sometimes used more generally to include misuse of the financial system (involving things such as securities, digital currencies, credit cards, and traditional currency), including terrorism financing and evasion of international sanctions. Most anti-money laundering ... [

       I haven't, but I've watched a lot of videos. It's hard to determine which is correct about what would happen on impact. What I do know is that planes are made of aluminum and the WTC outside structure was all TOUGH steel.

       I am a machinist who makes airplane parts, mostly wing structures and I can assure you there are lots of titanium parts as well as steel, aluminum, and composites.  i know nothing about what it could withstand but I thought I would just leave this comment.

       I don't think this is as big of a talking point as some people believe. F=ma and the planes were traveling at RIDICULOUS speeds, plus the wings are sturdier than the fuselage so if that can penetrate then you know the wings can. Have you ever seen the aftermath of a hurricane where a chunk of wood can penetrate a concrete barrier/curb/etc because it was traveling at 200 mph? I imagine the same thing applies here

       First of all, thank you. This is the kind of stuff I like to see on this sub.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's talk airline passengers. I have always read that the planes were all way under capacity for usual flights like that. (Not surprising, given all those people like Seth McFarlane who were supposed to fly on them but oh-so-coincidentally missed their flight.) Still, there were 60-odd people on each plane. What do you guys think happened to those people? Killed? Reprogrammed and disappeared? Has anyone looked into it?
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, OP, you mention some kind of flub with the PA crash site. What kind of flub? I have heard the theory - and it sounds like a good one - that whatever crashed in PA was not a commercial airliner and OT was intended to fly into WTC 7. Incidentally, the building where records pertaining to that lost money were held.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another thing about the passengers: According to my local news, a school teacher from my city was actually on one of the flights. United 77, I think. I actually knew her; she was one of my teachers in high school. Since looking into the information outside of the "official narrative" I have always wondered about her. A question I pose, then, is: Do many cities have school teachers that died in 9/11? Or local connections? Local news stations are notorious for latching onto this kind of thing and bringing up connections to tragedies, or at least mine are. If they got a press release with the name of someone from their city, they'd never question.

       thanks for the kind words/feedback. 9/11 research is actually how i stumbled across r/conspiracy a long time ago (lurked around before creating an account).

         Airline passengers: Not sure if they were aware, paid off, involved, threatened or what. But I found the video that's pretty convincing about the passengers being taken off the flight in Cleveland.

       <li>
        <p>
         PA Plane: My main theory is that it was actually supposed to go to DC and hit the White House (I have reason to believe this, can't find sources/dig it up though).
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       I think that the delay in Cleveland messed up the timing of the Pentagon/White House "plane" hits similar to the close timing of the Towers being hit. I believe they had to call an audible and used a missile instead, and still made it look like a plane at the Pentagon, and in PA they fabricated the story (possibly it was all a part of the plan / for the hero angle...no disrespect intended. I'm still not sure about this and until it's proven otherwise, I sit my logic aside and consider those people heroes).
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        I think all of the planes were de-boarded. I'm not sure if they were initially a small # of actual passengers and they docked the planes/had replacement military decoy planes ready, but the aviation paths and history suggests something like this happened. Still doesn't answer the question about the people/what happened to them.
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       That's probably the most disturbing thing about all of this is that regardless of what theory you have, everyone can almost collectively agree something was staged and not how they said it went down...and there are people involved/who had any knowledge of what actually happened (in any stage of the attack/day) and are quiet for whatever reason.

       I have to agree with this as well. Those of us who were adults when this happened, we saw how much was truly lost. We'd go bonkers. It would rip apart the fabric of our society to pull off the mask.

       i hope so too. unfortunately, the insanity of crimes at the top level often get nullified and ignored...like a slap on the wrist at worst. as much as i'd like to see it, regardless of if i ever "see vengeance" i know they'll pay for it once day.

       the motivating factor for me are the innocent people in those towers who died a horrible death. it really struck me hard when I did research on this at work early one morning and put myself in their shoes...just working a

        job
       </em>
       sitting at a desk, answering emails, being a normal human with a family/kids/spouse/life outside waiting and to have such a horrible thing happen. sorry, it's just infuriating to me.

       Not only that, but many were told to just stay there, that everything would be okay.  They didn't evacuate the other tower when the forst was hit either.  It was planned because they wanted carnage.

       i can't imagine that scenario...seeing the other building on fire, leaving, and hearing the loudspeaker say "go back to your desks, it's safe here" only to have the same thing happen moments later.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have thought a lot about what I'd do in that situation, and I would hope I'd bounce for a while. If I was at a side of the building to see the hole/people out of the windows/jumping, I'd be gone.
      </p>
      <p>
       Otherwise, truthfully I'd probably go back to my desk and get back to work asap. I try to remember that these people were so used to working that high up that the safety/security they probably felt would override their decision to leave. So many people made the wrong choice.

       The numbers were assumed to be so much higher for a long time, I'm sure many thank their lucky stars to have gotten out, but look at the crazy world we're in now.  So much hinged on 9/11, so much changed, and that is exactly what they wanted.  They say that "terrorism is theater", it's not meant to be about the victims as much as how its viewed by the public.  It was about 2006-2007 when I finally took that red pill.  I spent months going over videos and analysis.  At the time there wasn't that much out there besides footage and articles.  Loose Change was an eye opener, but many believe it's now disinfo because it only blamed the Bush admin, not the people who benefited the most, the Israelis.  I will go to my grave a happy person if we see some form, almost any form of justice for 9/11.  It was such a turning point for literally everything, that I can't really fathom when people say it doesn't matter any more.  Our liberties are being taken away one by one, and you can only point to 9/11 for that.  So much rage is in my heart, and it will never diminish.

       absolutely. as great as any documentary/theory is, i think it's nearly impossible to get it 100% right and present it in the right way. I also like Loose Change, but like you said, you can see the limited "bush did 9/11" scope he's viewing it under. There's so much more unseen.

       When I dig around for more answers, I try to remember that and use it as a barometer of what is bias/opinion and what could be considered truth/fact.

       understand, but PA + Pentagon should have been tons! There are so many videos of the aftermath of plane crashes, such as full speed crashes into a mountain/ground, and the result is 100% tons of debris, bodies, blood, etc.

       The medical examiners on the scene are quoted in another video saying "where's all the blood? where are the bodies?" they couldn't believe it either

       Long time researcher, 10 years plus, all excellent data and discussion.
I'm interested in theories regarding what happened to the people on the planes as I'm convinced they were remote drones...say they de-board the people from the planes, I've heard of secured hangers in secured airport areas, and from here the alleged phone calls were made from scripts and overseen by handlers, but what do you think happened to the people?

       See link 17 in the main post. It's a short-er vid that goes into all of that. I think there's a longer one that dives into the calls/secured hangers and stuff, haven't had time to dig it up and compare the two though.

       Very good effort. Two things:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         The demolition was nuclear -- subterranean 150kT thermonuclear demolition devices. That's why the buildings turned to dust, it's why so many 9/11 first responders contracted rare radiogenic cancers, it's why people reported the ground shaking immediately before each collapse, it's why huge 100m craters were left under each building. A lot of people hand-wave this away as divisive and unimportant, but
         <strong>
          Israel fucking nuked NYC
         </strong>
         . There are implications. Much more info here
         <a href="/r/nuclear911">
          /r/nuclear911
         </a>
         or ask specific questions if you like.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The planes were CGI -- computer generated, composited onto video of the explosion. Think 2001-era Hollywood special FX, passed off as news. (see
         <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CL0mJ5A6goY">
          Simon Shack: September Clues (2007)
         </a>
         ) There's an occult significance to both 77 and 93, the specific floors that were hit, two of the flight numbers. (see
         <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b3gJZw6X-LA">
          Mark Passio - Masonic Symbolism &amp; 9/11 Occult Numerology
         </a>
         ) There's no way even guided drones could have hit those floors so precisely to complete their big retarded ka0s majick spell. Top it off with
         <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Av2IZ29lwds">
          lying
         </a>
         <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z45hI6YuC-I">
          actors
         </a>
         and complicit media, and the sheep fall in line. Nevermind the only wreckage found was a landing gear and a neatly-placed engine from the wrong jet.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       These two aspects are vigorously concealed, as they reveal that
       <strong>
        Israel fucking nuked NYC
       </strong>
       and the media can and will use Hollywood special FX as news &lt;-- I expect we'll see a lot of this in the coming wars.

       Here's how you can spot the disinformation:
      </p>
      <p>
       " 150kT thermonuclear demolition devices, planted 77 meters under each building."
      </p>
      <p>
       The numbers - pulled out of their ass - are supposed to make it sounds more precise and "scientific." But those numbers are literally just made up, no one did any calculations or measurements.
      </p>
      <p>
       "There's no way even guided drones could have hit those floors so precisely "
      </p>
      <p>
       Just a falsehood, planted like a turd in the punchbowl so everyone can see it. Of course guided drones could have hit those floors so precisely. It's just a nonsense statement with no evidence, logic, or reason behind it.

       Thank you.  So sick of all these bandwagon "truthers" that don't give a shit about actually logic or evidence...you might as well just believe the official story if you're going to be stupid.
      </p>
      <p>
       Operation Northwoods was created in the early 60s.  Even if their drones could only fly in a straight line for ten feet with no wind...they sure as shit would be able to hit a building (that possibly could have even had tech honing devices planted in it) 40 years laters.

       i've also read about the "nuke" theory. it's incredible and frightening. not sure how I feel about it's truth, maybe I should revisit it...but regardless it's a very real possibility that there was a secret nuclear weapon used (for many reasons).
      </p>
      <p>
       still not sold on the CGI planes theory though. Eyewitnesses &gt; shady video for me. If anything I think there were real planes but the videos we saw on the news were CGI'd prior and given to all media outlets...this still seems hard to believe because of the timing required (but hey, BBC messed up about WTC7 didn't they? haha).

       I know it sounds crazy, but once you read into the PNAC document, you will realize that there is an element of next-generation electromagnetic warfare involved in 9/11, as well.  That document was the announcement of a trillion-dollar investment in true star wars technology.  Perhaps 9/11 was designed as merely an illusion -- a bluff, an art project -- in order to buy time.  Or maybe it was really done with EM weapons, with demolition as a back-up.  But either way, it was effective.  Because the technology now exists.  And the US military is so emboldened by it as to actually risk nuclear war with Russia.  This is not crank material.  This is the new geopolitical reality.

       Nope. I've read the PNAC document and there is zero, absolutely nothing, in that document that would lead one to believe the "next-generation electromagnetic warfare" was "involved" in 9/11.

       Man why is it always a 60 minute plus youtube video? Lol. I'm sceptical as it would require an incredible amount of electricity/energy to bring down a building that size.

       I guess it could be possible to basically create a giant plasma cutter under ground which would take out the entire base.

       No worries man; it is long (but nothing compared to the 5+ hrs (lol) of New Pearl Harbor which is a MUST watch) but well worth checking out. Dr. Wood seems to know her shit. Enjoy!

       I have only one strong objection:

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        countless empty boxes (that literally have the short-hand name for various explosives on the outside of the box) lining the walls
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       This can't be proven. There are fuse holders named "BB18" and it says "BB 18" on boxes which don't even have littelfuse logos.

       Unless I'm mistaken, these at least could have been boxes for POWR-BAR busbar fuse boxes.

       shows pictures, plus a more detailed description (towards the bottom) about what the packaging is said to contain.

      <p>
       I appreciate your input - It very well could have been nothing at all, a different product with BB 18 (not BB-18), or some other random code...I don't know. It doesn't destroy the narrative if it actually was not fuse boxes, but either way it's still an odd coincidence and I'd like to figure out the real truth, so thanks for explaining your view/point more in depth.

       Thank you for your understanding.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thank you for linking a source, but being a researcher of the subject myself, I am of course quite familiar with the evidence surrounding Gelitin and their "B-Thing", and it is certainly
       <em>
        possible
       </em>
       that these art students were, in truth, preparing the Towers for demolition, but
       <em>
        we simply have no evidence
       </em>
       . Still, I agree, this story is
       <em>
        proof
       </em>
       against the claim that a rigging operation couldn't have gone unnoticed - if a bunch of art students can secretly remove a window and send a helicopter to make photos, then a bunch of professionals can certainly rig the whole building.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I can only strongly urge any intellectually honest researcher to consider the speculation hanging its hat on the  "BB18"/"BB 18" littelfuse (un)boxes an unverified and extremely weak hypothesis which makes no sense at all, but somehow took on a life of its own and now seems to be very hard to kill.
      </p>
      <p>
       The boxes don't have the littelfuse logo.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fuse holders are called BB18, the boxes say BB 18.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nobody can explain why so many fuse holders would be needed to rig the building for demolition (especially since a wireless detonation mechanism seems to be more plausible).
      </p>
      <p>
       Unless new evidence emerges, I'd prefer not to see this misdirection spread, intentionally or unintentionally.

       hey, it definitely could have been. I think my point is if you agree with the official story, it makes sense. If you believe anything else, then there's virtually no
       <em>
        need
       </em>
       for hijackers since you could stage it however you'd like. who knows.

       interesting fact: My father in law was a pilot for 40 yrs for Continental / United, and he confirmed that their pilot "skills" are widely documented as inadequate/incapable of flying those large planes.

       The planners used intelligence services in Pakistan and Saudi as well as Israeli groups and individuals to help conduct the operation.    The stand down of Norad means it was the US deep state that is to blame primarily,   which for all we know is made up of global interests.    There is probably a deep state in Israel as well.

       The key players are not that easy to pin down.    Not at the Vatican,  not at any given University even.   Some people come and go,   rise and fall.    Others are there behind the scenes for longer.    But the banks,  law firms,   and top corporations are certainly represented,  especially in the military and pharmaceutical industries.    I would also keep the think tanks involved.   On the other hand,   the BS about the queen of england,  she is rich,  she has people,   but come on,  those people are dumb.    Any really rich families,  they will be traceable by their influence with law firms and banks.
      </p>
      <p>
       The power is really quite distributed.    The reason 9/11 worked is that it was a pivotal event that benefited and unified so many players under a single purpose,    a western power grab that was to last for decades,  following the end of the cold war.

       Its good to take advantage of some of the key historical trajectories when coping with key turning points.

       The technical aspect of manhatten buildings is slightly incidental compared to the pentagon which meant that the US as a whole could be mobilized for decades long conquest.    Sure it was impressive to destroy those towers etc.  but it was equally impressive to have those 19 patsies traipsing about at their little Cessna schools too,  as a distraction.    It was impressive to have the media and Nato mobilized to be on story.    The twin towers get more than their fair share of attention,  as intended.

       yeah the level of destruction is just so insane that I haven't ruled this out. I've seen some great videos on it, but it's so "secret"-based that it's hard to wrap your mind around the "how" they would do it though. certainly a strong possibility

       Incendiaries and explosives have been in use for centuries, have commonly known characteristics, are relatively affordable and don't come with an insanely high energy cost to activate. Examining pictures of the remaining debris and rubble are more consistent with explosions than... ahem... dustification. It also doesn't make sense to go through the trouble of wiring WTC7 in a classic demolition when you can just zap the twin towers.

       But she doesn't explain it... What form of energy supposedly "dustifies" steel? She gives a hypothesis, but her observations are limited to showing pictures and asks "where did this go?" "what does this?". If something can disintegrate a building, it can be done on a smaller scale to disintegrate a bolt. No experiments, examples or solid conclusion.

       Uh... she could explain that it's an energy that separates molecules on an atomic level, creating what appears to be dust. But we know from analyzing dust samples that while it was very fine, particulates in the dust weren't atomic scale.

       There is plenty of debris, both in
       <a href="http://imgur.com/a/8cEkW">
        OKC
       </a>
       and
       <a href="http://imgur.com/a/34RPt">
        WTC
       </a>
       . It certainly didn't evaporate, and if you look at pictures of NYC streets you'll even see that paper survived, it's everywhere. OKC was limited to the face of the building, where all the rubble slumped down to the front, while the towers had everything blown outward. 350,000 tonnes of steel was removed from the WTC site, not vaporized.
      </p>
      <p>
       I personally don't believe it was just thermite/thermate, there must have been explosives as well to create the pressure blast necessary to shatter concrete. This same "dust" is seen often in controlled demolitions, just not on this scale. In a known controlled demo, the demo team has plenty of time to gut out the inside of the building and weaken structures before the blast.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you have to blow up an intact building (semi-covertly) without being able to weaken it first, thermite/thermate can handle the weakening of the steel, and explosives finish it off. There was no flash because there's no windows in the elevator shafts, and there were reports of consecutive explosions from first responders and other witnesses. Most video I've seen near ground zero sounds like a constant roar during collapse, sequentially timed explosives could have the same effect. Plus if you see street level videos of the collapse you can see it symmetrically being blown outward.

       It's neither baseless nor instant, I've looked into him before and have seen his videos. All of which can be recreated as a parlor trick. He's like a metallurgical youtube magician, you

       You can't tell from the air shot but the debris piles were 3-6+ stories high, and there's also 5 basement levels below ground. Buildings are mostly air (crazy, huh?), so when you bring them down they take up a lot less space than when they were standing.

       Yes, approximately 100,000 tonnes per tower. They cleared out over 350,000 tonnes from the entire complex during clean-up. The "dustify" method used was not very efficient. Like I said, much of a building is air, and particularly the towers were designed for more floor space.

       If this is in reference to the roof holes, that would most likely be due to debris punching a hole in the roof while the surrounding structure was still able to support the load. If it's about holes in steel beams, see the next section.

       Well, now we're not talking about
       <em>
        dustification
       </em>
       . Thermite would account for this piece of evidence. The max temperature for common thermite (aluminum + iron oxide) is roughly 2500&amp;deg;C, the melting point of steel is on average 1500&amp;deg;C. It would also account for the strange "meteorite" found that was mostly iron with all sorts of other material and elements melded together.
      </p>
      <p>
       When thermite burns, it produces aluminum oxide and molten iron slag. Use a lot of thermite in an enclosed space and the slag has a chance to pool up before it's able to cool. If that enclosed space reaches a high temperature ("like a foundry" as one first responder said), that slag may take a very long time to cool, particularly if the thermite is still reacting.

      <p>
       Feel free to explain this, because this isolated statement does not. If you didn't know, the maximum heat output of thermite is 2500&amp;deg;C because that is the average boiling point of aluminum, i.e. the primary component of a thermite reaction starts to evaporate. Steel may start to evaporate (vaporize) at 2900&amp;deg;C+ depending on the composition. So why would you think that the structure would turn to smoke and vapor?
      </p>
      <p>
       It would not take 100,000 tonnes of thermite to sufficiently weaken the structure, nor would it ever get hot enough to reduce steel to smoke and dust via thermite.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you don't understand the nature of the materials involved, you have no business arriving at a conclusion. Leaps of faith are not acceptable when it comes to science.

       There were more buildings in the WTC, not just 1, 2 and 7. Buildings 3-6 were in the shadow of the towers, closer than 7. They suffered catastrophic structural damage from falling debris (more steel that escaped Judy's super-weapon I suppose) and were subsequently dismantled and removed.

      <p>
       Just as we point out inconsistencies in the official story, we must also point out inconsistencies in alternate explanations. It seems you're already aware of this as that's what you've been trying to do with the information I've presented. I don't believe I can present anything that you will rationally consider, but perhaps it can aid other readers, who may be on the fence, to examine things a bit more critically before confirmation bias has its chance to set in.

       1.) Dr. Wood does not present a "theory". When you have a theory, you have a set of beliefs or principles that might not be proven yet. Dr. Wood presents EVIDENCE which supports a conclusion based on ALL of the EVIDENCE. Evidence is anything that can be used to prove something — like the evidence presented in a trial, or the trail of white pebbles that is evidence of the path Hansel and Gretel took through the woods. There are those who criticize Dr. Wood by stating that,"She's got nothing without what the weapon was and how it was used." You don't need the serial numbers for the gizmo to know what happened. When "white man" first arrived on the American continent with firearms, indigenous people did not need to know the serial numbers of their weapons to know what they can do. They didn't need to have seen such weapons in order to know that there exists a weapon that can fire a piece of metal fast enough to kill their brothers. Likewise, by the end of the day on August 6, 1945, the people living near Hiroshima, Japan, did not need to understand how a nuclear bomb works in order to know that there exists a technology that can produce enormous amounts of heat or to know that there exists a super-duper Kinetic Energy Weapon (KEW) that is capable of destroying an entire city. Theory, speculation, and belief are not necessary to understand that a type of directed energy was used on 9/11, rather, only a detailed study of the empirical evidence from 9/11 is necessary. This also helps to illustrate a major difference between Dr. Judy Wood and other 9/11 self proclaimed researchers, as she did not start with theory or speculation and then begin researching to see if it was consistent with the evidence. Instead, Dr. Wood simply did what any objective, vigilant scientist would do, she gathered and studied as much of the empirical evidence from 9/11 as possible, assembling a monumental database of verifiable physical evidence that dwarfs the efforts of any other 9/11 "research", including the unscientific '9/11 Commission Report'.
      </p>
      <p>
       2.) Had you read WHERE DID THE TOWERS GO? you would know that Dr. Wood DOES explain the mechanism. She even gives it a name on the top of page 365 [magnetic-electrogravitic-nuclear reactions]

       3.)The oil industry (leaded gas), tobacco industry (lung cancer), and more recently the NFL (chronic traumatic encephalopathy),  have all spent millions and millions of dollars marginalizing scientific findings and the scientists that find them  by way of "public relations" which is another word for propaganda. Lead in the food chain, carcinogens in the air, and brain damaged football players are all good for you, right? Whose interest will benefit from the peaceful use of the technology that destroyed 7 buildings with a WTC prefix? It isn't the petroleum, coal, gas, or nuclear industries.

       The scientific method starts with presenting a problem (or question). Next step is hypothesis, aka a
       <em>
        theory
       </em>
       . Then you gather data using various means, including experiments. Following that, you analyze all the data collected and determine if you can come to a solid conclusion or need to refine your data gathering/experimentation phase for better analysis.

       The native Americans knew what their guns could do because they saw the flash of the guns, they could see the wounds were not like arrows, and they could remove the bullets from their wounded.

       A nuclear explosion is incredibly visible. I'm not sure where you heard the term KEW used, but that's not what it is. Anyway, with a nuclear blast, there's radiation, specific radioactive isotopes, and radiation sickness.

      <p>
       Steel was
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       "dustified" as I have explained elsewhere, there was no suspicious levels of radiation, and all seismic graphs within reasonable bounds of the collapse.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, what
       <em>
        unique
       </em>
       identifying characteristics are there where the only explanation is an exotic weapon? What DEW leaves the chemical signature of thermite, but is not thermite?

       We know this because we know those things above involve Kinetic Energy and/or Thermal Energy and we know that the "dustification" was done without Kinetic Energy and without Thermal Energy. That is, "dustification" was not done with high heat (Thermal Energy) nor with some form of Kinetic Energy (wrecking ball, projectile, gravity collapse). The building was not cooked to death nor was it beaten to death. So Kinetic Energy Weapons (KEW) did not destroy the buildings nor did Thermal Energy Weapons (TEW) destroy the buildings. But we know that Energy was Directed somehow (and controlled within fairly precise boundaries) to cause the building to turn to dust in mid air. That is, some kind of (cold) Directed Energy that was used as a weapon (cDEW) had to have done this. Energy was directed and manipulated within the material such that it came apart without involving high heat (fire, welding materials such as thermite) and without having something fly through the air and hit it (bullets, missile, bombs, wrecking ball, a giant hammer, or many micro hammers)
      </p>
      <p>
       If this technology can manipulate energy to do something like this, it can also be manipulated to provide us with "free energy" (i.e. "off the grid"). Simply by looking at the cover of Dr. Wood's book you can realize there must be a technology that can do this. This is evidence that such technology does exist. This is evidence that a technology capable of providing "free energy" ("off the grid") exists. The whole world witnessed this which means the whole world can know that "free-energy technology" exists. This realization will change the world. This is probably the biggest reason why there is so much effort spent misrepresenting, distorting, and suppressing Dr. Wood's research.

       One thing you don't acknowledge is that it is physically for your typical airliner to come in at the speed and angle of attack that the planes did that day. If they were commercial airliners they would have been ripped apart in the air going that speed at such a low altitude.

       There were Israeli art students doing strange things in the US at that time. The ones with residencies in the WTC were professional artists, and they were Austrian (assuming you're talking about Gelatin/B-Thing.)
      </p>
      <p>
       I dont think this discredits the rest of what you wrote, nor am I saying they weren't involved ... their drawings are very suspect to say the least.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think the Israeli student/Austrian artist confusion is intentional to help discredit those who stumble on the connection. People talk about the Israeli art students, and then lump Gelitin/B-Thin in with them, and then it's easy to dismiss as "anti semetic"
      </p>
      <p>
       The two groups to look at are Gelitin/B-Thing and E-Space, both on those floors, and both doing things that could be helpful for the later operation. I think Gelitin was in the know, and E-Space were useful idiots, and both provided cover for intelligence operative posing as Israeli art students that were fflooding the country at that time.

       Yeah, you got to think about how the internet works to understand the way intelligence has to work. The internet means all information is out there, you can't hide things by making them not exist, you can only hide things by making other things exist.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you have an art student involved in your plot, you want multiple different art students involved. You want multiple stories about each art student that are slightly different. Kind of like spelling your name differently on each form, putting different addresses and phone numbers, etc..
      </p>
      <p>
       You want to add elements to the story so that you control not just the mainstream narrative, but also the "truther" narrative from the very beginning. You want to put in things that are true, but seem ridiculous.
      </p>
      <p>
       You want to add coincidences to things so that people make connections to related, but unrelated things. You want to add bizarre details that make people almost discredit themselves. You want to tell the same story as many different times, but with slightly different details.
      </p>
      <p>
       Find a weird detail about a real event. Put something connected to that in your false event. People start making connections that are there, but aren't. It becomes difficult to search for one thing, because you end up with the other thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some people say there is a thing like predictive programming to prepare people for a future event. Possible. What if instead it's plotters sprinkling in details to put in red herrings, false leads, ways that make people go "no, you're thinking of a movie."

       When the second plane hit, it felt like a 5.0 earthquake (lived in Japan for 3 years, know what earthquakes feel like).  The monitor in front of me nearly fell on me.  Parts of the ceiling fell down.  Windows broke.

       I was standing on Broadway and Pine when the South Tower collapsed.  There was no explosion, let alone explosions.  There was a loud rumbling at first and then vibrations like a 2.0 earthquake as the tower collapsed.
      </p>
      <p>
       As the tower collapsed, it tilted so far forward I thought it was going to fall on me.  It collapsed first at the point of impact.  Controlled demolitions that I've seen videos of all have simultaneous explosions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, as I watched it collapse there was zero visible or audio cues of explosives.
      </p>
      <p>
       IMHO the plane that hit the South Tower hit in a more structurally significant location, hence the reason the South Tower collapsed first even though the North Tower was hit far earlier that morning.

       wow thank you for the incredible insight/story. i can't imagine how crazy/scary that was to be there. I truly mean no disrespect in formulating these theories, but there is so much that is unanswered for those of us who only experienced it through a TV and the more we look into it, the more questions there are about what happened.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you mind answering this, just so I can be more informed from your perspective?
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        IF there were explosions, do you think that you may not have heard the explosions because of how far you were from the towers and the "bombs" were coming from deep within the structure/underground? (I'm not sure where you were/how far...I'm assuming you could hear explosions regardless)
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       The main reason I believe there were explosions were due to the eyewitness accounts/interviews of people from the basement/lobby who experienced it first hand including people who were severely injured/dead prior to the planes hitting.
      </p>
      <p>
       A close second to my main reason for thinking there were explosions is that the lobby is seen on video as being completely destroyed/blown out (including the huge marble walls, turnstiles destroyed, etc). Firefighters, police, WTC staff all describe it as a bomb went off...several stories of them being blasted by explosions through the big windows.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thanks for taking the time to tell us your story and perspective/insights on this.

       So a long time ago I was riding in a very fast car on the autobahn and a black blur flew by us.  About 20 minutes later we slowed at a field of debris.  If you just saw pictures of the remains of the cars, how scattered pieces were, how small pieces were, how unrecognizable pieces were, IMHO you would 100% say you were looking at pictures of cars that were blown up by explosives.  Hollywood movies have taught us that even cars going very fast stay intact in crashes and perhaps catch fire or explode after the crash.  The reality is a car going at 220KPH is going to essentially disintegrate if it hits another car.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, my point is if you only look at pictures it's very easy to draw incorrect conclusions of what happened because unless you see an event unfolding in front of you, you simply can't grasp the physics.  The only reference your brain has for buildings falling down is controlled demolition, therefore your brain forces that connection.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you've ever been around tall buildings you will know they create a fantastic echo chamber.  Any loud noise bounces back and forth off the buildings.  If there had been any explosions it would have been deafening.  A car backfiring in Manhattan sounds like an explosion.  I can only imagine what actual bombs exploding would sound like.  Probably lots of bleeding ears IMHO.  I've watch 4th of July fireworks many, many times in Manhattan and the sound of the fireworks echoes endlessly around the buildings.  I'm truly sorry, but as I watched the South Tower and North Tower collapse I heard no explosions.  The towers were pulverized by the weight of the damaged floors.  It was very slow at first, but as each successive floor collapsed the weight increased and the next floor collapsed faster.
      </p>
      <p>
       People I've talked to who were even closer to the Towers have said to me one of the worst memories is the elevators plunging inside the shafts.  Some people told me they are haunted by the screams of people trapped in those elevators as them plunged 50+ stories and exploded upon impact.
      </p>
      <p>
       Finally, there was so much debris from the Towers.  There was an endless stream of garbage trucks lined up just outside the AMEX for months.  There was a rinsing station on the street, to spray the trucks before they went over the Verrazano, to reduce the dust.  Like every 10 minutes a new truck would roll by.  24/7.  Tons and tons of debris.
      </p>
      <p>
       The smell and the rats were one of my worst memories after the fact.

       that is correct. it is an artist's rendition of the van described on the actual police audio. even though there aren't pictures, but the van itself with mural/events/capturing the israeli men is fact and happened.

       I'm not saying the event didn't happen. I'm saying the picture is disinformation. Some people will pass it around as a real picture, the people that see it will research it and find out it's not, then they will discard the entire story.

       I'm suspicious of this post because you claim to have researched for years but leave out some of the biggest issues.
      </p>
      <p>
       The planes that hit WTC were traveling too fast at too low of an altitude. The planes should not have been traveling that fast and certainly would have their maneuverability compromised at such a low altitude. For a novice pilot to direct the plane with such precision is impossible. There are videos of the second plane hitting that show it has extra piece of equipment, what looks like a extra fuel container like what military jets have, hanging under a wing.
      </p>
      <p>
       You also left out stuff on the Pentagon plane. A guy who never learned to land a Cessna put plane into a 270 degree descending dive that leveled out to hit the first floor of a building. It was an absurdly complex maneuver that most pilots of the aircraft could not do, let alone a guy who took a couple weeks flying turboprops. There were also many civilian security cameras that filmed the attack yet no footage has ever been realized.
      </p>
      <p>
       Plenty of other stuff you didn't mention like no footage of the terrorist getting on the planes. Sibel Edmonds, the mayor of San Francisco getting a call not to fly, the plane transponders going off, black boxes not being recovered, the FBI never listing OBL as being wanted for the attacks, members of the 9/11 commission saying it was set up to fail and constantly being stonewalled after months of not even being a thing because GWB had to be pressured to even set up a commission.
      </p>
      <p>
       You have a lot of the main points in your post. I agree that the planes were deboarded, at least. They were probably switched out with remote control versions to make sure passengers didn't screw it up. One person opens a cabin door and the entire plan falls apart, no way that was left to chance. This combined with novice pilots and transponders going off and black boxes not being recovered leads me to conclude that the planes that hit the buildings were different planes that had been modified.

       thanks for the reply and feedback. most of the "significant" things I left out was due to brevity's sake and/or my attempt to create a coherent post quickly to get back to work haha. Trust me, there's a lot more I wanted to include, and a lot more I wish I could have elaborated on.
      </p>
      <p>
       to your point about the planes, although I didn't directly state that the planes made ridiculous maneuvers with pinpoint precision, I was attempting to imply this by the use of drone aircraft.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Pentagon plane was coupled with my frustrations with the PA plane in point 14. I should have made a separate point calling out the BS "plane hit the Pentagon" story, when all real evidence suggests otherwise. I may update the post tomorrow when I'm not so tired.
      </p>
      <p>
       Good points about the "terrorists" boarding the planes. From my memory there's only blurry footage of two middle eastern men at Dulles Airport going through the security checkpoint on 9/11, which they say were 2 hijackers, but truly could have been anyone.

       They were put of place, that's how it came to light.  Id like to explain more except... it really is that simple.
      </p>
      <p>
       The people that crunch these numbers for a living know when there's too much action for it to be a coincidence.  Remember, this is an industry that combats insider trading and laundering all the time.  Luckily for the government, the lay-people don't fully understand this, so "it's just a coincidence" still works to explain statistics that are virtually coincidence-proof.

       Maaan this is a tough one. I honestly don't know. As with each "topic" of 9/11 this in itself has many theories all of its own.
      </p>
      <p>
       Part of me wants to say that the people were paid off, threatened, or somehow in on it. They'd have to be in order to have new lives/go under the radar like this for so long.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another part of me thinks they were crisis actors (or maybe a mix with some real people). If you believe the lengths the gov went for everything else (and it's actually a fact that they used crisis actors on 9/11 for interviews)...then it wouldn't be surprising they would stage fake calls/family interviews etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       That is all to say I have no idea. I absolutely mean no disrespect because it's just a wild theory and more than likely these people really died in some fashion and they had families they left behind and that shouldn't be disrespected if it's true.

       Absolutely fantastic work!!!! Even dozens of the comments in this thread do a phenomenal job at using real critical thinking skills to analyse the facts. I have one question though. I've heard before about the billions and billions of dollars that the government was going to default on or something on 9/12/2001, but I've struggled to find much about this. Does anyone have any good videos or sites that explain this in much better detail?!? Thanks everyone!!!! It's sincerely a refreshing site to see that there still are people that are actively engaged in getting the truth out. Faith in humanity +1

       Thanks for the comment/feedback. Link #1 in the original post talks about the 2 billion that went missing/was announced. After 9/11 it was the first time in history that money was "cleared" by the Securities and Exchange Commission (as if it never went missing).

       I mean, I trade options, and I am just saying, its not really proof, definitely suspicions, like I would be curious about less direct plays, like gold for instance, would be interesting to see the options on some of the gold funds around sep 11, less direct, harder to prove someone was trading gold with insider knowledge.

       IMO, There was enough debris for a passenger plane once you consider that aluminium basically pancakes if it runs into something solid.
The aluminium basically extruded through the holes between the steel beams and that's why you see so much debris once everything actually falls down/apart.
 The reason why it could have been less damage then the trade towers (where they bent the steel beams at the bolts) was because it was closer to the ground and more reinforced. The hole size was from retracted steel landing gear.

       I agree with you that a plane didn't hit it. It was a bomb or missile of some sort. There are eye witness accounts of a plane coming down low near the Pentagon then rising up and flying off after the explosion.
      </p>
      <p>
       The most obvious reason I'll never believe it was a plane was because of the size of the hole/damage. Makes zero sense to say it was a plane. (Also, fun fact, there's video out there showing the debris from the "plane" leftover and how it could NOT have been from the plane they say it was because that equipment was never made for it and only for a different type of craft)

       Missile hits Pentagon. A missile is also used to shoot Flight 93. That way if people start hearing about missiles in a conspiracy theory, they get led towards Flight 93 instead of Pentagon. Americans could stomach a conspiracy about covering up shooting down Flight 93 for the good of the nation, in fact many would approve of that and understand the reason for covering it up.
