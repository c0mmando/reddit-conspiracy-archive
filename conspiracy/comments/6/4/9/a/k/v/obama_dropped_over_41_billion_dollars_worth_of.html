<p>All we have to do is make it a felony punishable by 2 years in prison without parole and $100,000 fine for employing anyone without citizenship, a proper work permit, green card, or for harboring an undocumented alien. ( wait that&#39;s already a law? )</p>

<p>But none of these affluent class want to give up their cheap lawn and child and food workers or health-care workers. (Skilled or not) And we sure don&#39;t want to pay another nickel for a head of lettuce harvested by well paid workers under non-slave working conditions.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Why should people have to pay taxes?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We shouldn&#39;t. Taxation is theft. If you want a service, pay for it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Also how does eating lunch keep someone in poverty?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It allows them to rely on the government for goodies, when the parents themselves should being providing a lunch for the children. Maybe if they knew the government wasn&#39;t going to pay, they would try to work harder and earn more money to provide for their children? Welfare is actually a truly bad thing on the whole. It keeps people impoverished. That was the point of it, and to get generations voting for the democrats. I&#39;ll give you Lyndon B. Johnson in his own words:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I’ll have those niggers voting Democratic for 200 years</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Methinks, that is not someone who has people&#39;s best interest in mind. It&#39;s all by design. But, people can plug their ears, cover their eyes and yell: &quot;lalalalallala&quot;, all they want..</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Every gun that is made, every warship launched, every rocket fired signifies, in the final sense, a theft from those who hunger and are not fed, those who are cold and are not clothed. This world in arms in not spending money alone. It is spending the sweat of its laborers, the genius of its scientists, the hopes of its children. The cost of one modern heavy bomber is this: a modern brick school in more than 30 cities. It is two electric power plants, each serving a town of 60,000 population. It is two fine, fully equipped hospitals. It is some 50 miles of concrete highway. We pay for a single fighter with a half million bushels of wheat. We pay for a single destroyer with new homes that could have housed more than 8,000 people. This, I repeat, is the best way of life to be found on the road the world has been taking.
This is not a way of life at all, in any true sense. Under the cloud of threatening war, it is humanity hanging from a cross of iron.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not to contradict you, good point...</p>

<p>All we have to do is make it a felony punishable by 2 years in prison without parole and $100,000 fine for employing anyone without citizenship, a proper work permit, green card, or for harboring an undocumented alien. ( wait that&#39;s already a law? )</p>

<p>But none of these affluent class want to give up their cheap lawn and child and food workers or health-care workers. (Skilled or not) And we sure don&#39;t want to pay another nickel for a head of lettuce harvested by well paid workers under non-slave working conditions.</p>

<p>Franky, the wall is bullshit. </p>
