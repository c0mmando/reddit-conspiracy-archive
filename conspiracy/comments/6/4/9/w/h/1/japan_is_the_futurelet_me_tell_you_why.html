      <p>
       First time visiting Japan, and during a critical time when the tensions are high in China, Russia, North Korea, and USA. Despite all the foreign nonsense, Japan remains serene, peaceful, and continued unwaveringly generosity. Here are my top reasons why Japan is the Future and the world outside Japan needs to wise up.
      </p>
      <p>
       1) The Yakuza run $86 billion of their economy, yet there is not one unsafe place in Japan and no signs of graffiti, gangs and/or thugs. It's essentially an export of crime while the Japanese benefit from their international organization. Keeping Japan safe and clean for the most part.
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         They rarely have international news in Japanese. You can get American version of CNN or BBC, but if you go thru the local channels, there isn't much about politics or religion, or anything depressing. Their shows are whacky but they're light and humorous. Minimal seriousness, unless you're watching a drama.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         They have an invisible cast system, essentially people are designated between classes based on appearance, driving, housing, dining, etc. The surprising aspect of this is everyone is content, and continue to hold pride for their work ethic, even if it drives them to suicide. The pride and honor of this culture has made them more apologetic than aggressive and fear of being embarrassed maintains this odd sense of order.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         They have mastered the art of the toilet and it's not only an amazing experience to take a shit, it's almost magical. It's welcoming and they have blended the art and science together. I had to mention this, let's continue...
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Simplicity and minimalism, it's what keeps them always improving. The attention to detail and perfection, keeps them focused on the now, not tomorrow or yesterday. They have a sense of connection to their world and craft to provide the best regardless of profit. For example, a pizza place that serves only 2 pizzas for 3 hours then closes. Getting a massage at a high end spa and no one trying to up sell you on products. The concept of no tipping and reducing excessiveness.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         I get all the weird shops, sexual stores and karaoke. It's an outlet and it's offered at the highest service to the Japanese. Instead of resorting to crime, drugs (which you can't find even if you try), or other dumb shit, they use these places to have a dark side if that's what you want to call it. From fetish to singing, there is something for everyone to wild out.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Okay, this one was odd at first and I didn't understand until I meditated on it a bit. There are hardly any trash cans anywhere in public. I went searching and searching and even within stores there are very few and if you see them, there tiny. I didn't get why, and then I realized the Japanese people care about their country and they don't liter (huge generalization) as much. Additionally, they seem to be efficient in distributing and discarding of waste. I don't know, open to ideas here. The other thing is smoking cigarettes is forbidden unless in designated areas, so you don't see cig butts everywhere, it's spotless. The strange thing though is you can smoke in restaurants. That was a bit backwards to me. On the one hand, Japanese people drink tea, eat light/healthy, and zen out but on the other hand they smoke like chimneys in restaurants. It was an oddly gross behavior for it being banned outside.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Transportation, Transportation, let me say that one more time Transportation. This was by far a frictionless experience, even as a foreigner. First, the bullet train, beyond useful and extremely efficient. In Japan, public transit is on another level. Again, investing in infrastructure rather than war machines. They have high speed trains and regular local trains and for the price of a McDonalds happy meal you can get from Tokyo to Kyoto (2 hour ride) with ease. In Japan, the trains get you to ever part of the country, and therefore, cars are designated only for the wealthy or "executives". This refers to point 3. The taxis are white glove service, and they have super tech inside, both payment processing, GPS, and automatic door openers so the taxi driver doesn't have to get out but still opens the door for you. Additionally, Thur wear white gloves and suits and they drive with extreme caution. If you don't put on a seat belt, a soft but annoying female voice will keep telling you to put it on. It's a speaker in the back seat, I was wondering where it came from. Lastly, the trains are more precise then my calculator, they arrive on time, depart on time...I looked it up and apparently in a year the average delay for a train is under 1 minute in total! The only downside is morning traffic between 07:00 and 09:00 when you want to avoid it. That's when it's packed as hell and a nightmare, but hey I get the same shit in SF on the BART.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       9 and 10 to come, have to head to my tour group.
      </p>
      <p>
       Note: the conspiracy angle is that the world needs to act more like Japan, focus on your country and ignore the rest of the world, then sell all your goods and create a connected export economy. Offer your citizens outlets not drugs and excessive junk food.
      </p>
      <p>
       Note 2: I'm not advocating Japan is the best, the culture and country have faults. My point is trying to focus on the now and the improvement of society and technology to benefit the people. By bringing in a set of standards and providing services to their people, Japan has in some ways  Truman showed their whole country. For me, it felt oddly interesting and pleasing but maybe it would pass if I lived here. Who knows. Japanese people, please comment.
      </p>
      <p>
       Disclaimer: I don't have sympathy for Ex-Pats complaining about racism. I'm sure they don't want you here for a reason. Additionally, if you fought for your country that you so love, why stay in Japan? Anyways, I don't want to derail the essence of my message with your sob complaints.
      </p>

       Down voters: please explain why?

       They also don't have massive amounts of immigration, people don't criticize them for being racists because of it. UNLIKE the West, where we cant even stop the illegals crossing our borders.

       I haven't received one ounce of racism, discrimination, and or unpleasant behavior. In fact, I left my umbrella in a taxi and the guy came back to my hotel and gave it to the door man who then delivered it to my room. Name one taxi service in the US or Uber for that matter that would do that. I think if you have experienced it, it's likely that you've been rude and didn't respect their culture.

       Sure they might be all that you say. But how do they treat the people who won't conform to their societal standards? Do you really believe shaming someone because their job isn't as good and their material things are not as impressive as the next guy is how society should be?
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe it is peaceful but it sounds a lot less free to me. I don't know about you but my mom lived in japan in the past and she said it was very easy to find drugs. But I wouldn't mind going over there to meet some asian babes who have a gaijin fixation :). I wish society would try to be more civilized but at the same time realize there are fundamental differences in cultures that sometimes just do not mesh well together. It doesn't mean tolerate their behavior in a race to be the most "progressive" and I can respect Japan for that.

       Fair points, I am only basing my observations on my experience. The only people selling drugs were the Nigerians in Shinjinku, and that's a hell of a tourist trap.
      </p>
      <p>
       I wouldn't term it as free vs. not free, but they do have a strict code of ethics and I believe that has provided order that in some ways is necessary. Compare to people who have tons of freedom in the US, it leads to all types of diseases, aggression, excessiveness, laziness, and more. Argument can be made both ways, and I can see both sides having solid points.

        Karōshi (過労死?), which can be translated literally as "overwork death" in Japanese, is occupational sudden mortality. The major medical causes of karōshi deaths are heart attack and stroke due to stress and a starvation diet. This phenomenon is also widespread in South Korea, where it is referred as 'gwarosa' (과로사/過勞死). In China, overwork-induced suicide is called 'guolaosi' (过劳死).

       This is true, the work ethic is unbearable for most. They are the sacrificial lambs, so to speak. I did ask people and it's accurate. I won't defend it, I need to think more about this to fit it to my narrative, but essentially it sucks.

       Hey OP. What I've heard about Japan.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most altruistic country, longest lifespan, 2nd most likely to challenge authority (behind the U.S.)
      </p>
      <p>
       Japan seems oddly similar to the U.S. in many ways, and starkly different in others. Why are the U.S. and Japan the main video game developers in the world? Is it because we value entertainment and technology, or we are the only cultures well off enough to have a huge amount of free time?

       Japan somewhat created video games or popularized it and viewed it as an art.  America turned it into Hollywood and tried to make as much money on it regardless of what they churn out.

       Good point, I'm not sure, I think Japan developed games because they don't have enough space to build entertainment like we do in the states. Examples, Disneyland, Movie Theaters, Sporting Stadiums, etc. I think games allow us to detach but stay attached if that makes sense. More to come, enjoying my whiskey right now :-)

       The toilets also have a button you can push right before you blow your load, that males nature sounds so that no one can hear your butt trumpet.
      </p>

       And my favorite part, they know when you poop, and they suck the stinky air up in a vacuum.

       I'll post pics later, but first let me give you a break down of taking a shit in Japan.
      </p>
      <p>
       1) walk into a zen style bathroom, only shades of khaki and white and turn to face the toilet and automatically it opens up the seat, and then begins a bowl wash.
      </p>
      <p>
       2) already amazed at the automation, you sit down and realize the seat is heated. It not only puts you at peace, but it makes it easier to shit. A natural laxative if you want to think about it that way.
      </p>
      <p>
       3) you take your shit, and you can massage your thighs with the vibrating seat. They also have private mode that plays music or displays lights on the seat.
      </p>
      <p>
       4) you're now done with your shit and dumbfounded by the numerous options for whipping your ass. First you use the bidet, a smooth and soft cleansing. Of course they have pressure settings and temperature as well as forward/back controls. You then move to the ass shower, that is high pressure spray and it basically goes from your balls to the back of the ass. Lastly you finish off with a dry, and it puts fusing to shame, my ass was spotless from all the wetness.
      </p>
      <p>
       5) once you're done shitting and get off the seat it automatically cleans, flushes and closes the lid. I literally walk in shit and walk off while playing a video game for my ass cleaning.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lastly, this isn't only high end places, this is every restaurant and hotel I went to. They vary in features, but for the most part come with the basics.

       so you think killing your self by cutting your gut because your father got his ass kicked or something is

       and good in 21. century?

      <p>
       i do admire their dedication, innovation and technology advancement but having weird shops and karaoke is not one of them. many countries have legalized prostitution and while i do agree this should be the norm, it's definitely not what keeps them

       Look, we can debate good and bad about any city in the world. If you want to talk about treating women like slaves, look at Saudi Arabia, Americas number 1 friend.

      <p>
       The weird shit is only there if you look for it. It's not in your face at all, that's what I initially expected to see. Vending machines selling used pantries and dildos everywhere. It's hard to find and even if you do it's not Gajin friendly.
      </p>
      <p>
       My main point to your comment is that it has truth, but you certainly disregard the essence of my post with the positive light of how America failed to invest in its people, culture and technology to benefit rather than to capitalize on our slave earning wages and tax us to hell and prevent us from flourishing.

       Ok, lets talk about the garbage cans. Starting with the sarin gas attacks in 1995. In an act of domestic terrorism, a cult put sarin gas containers into garbage cans in the subway. The attack was really bad, and the government removed all garbage cans for a limited time, in case they tried it again.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now as the cans were temporarily removed, the government realized they were saving a huge amount of money by not having them, and so they just never brought them back again.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now most of us have to run to the conbini, and drop off our garbage there.

       For 8,9,10 you should add one about the education system here. Starts in nursery school, by the time the kids start 1st grade they are already better thab kids in a US 3rd grade level. They also do the cleaning, and serve each other food. The schooling here is so amazing. At least from birth through middle school.

       Either McDonalds is insanely expensive or you are so wrong you might not have even been to Japan. The bullet train from Tokyo to Kyoto is ~$120 one way.

       Fair points, I am only basing my observations on my experience. The only people selling drugs were the Nigerians in Shinjinku, and that's a hell of a tourist trap.

      <p>
       I wouldn't term it as free vs. not free, but they do have a strict code of ethics and I believe that has provided order that in some ways is necessary. Compare to people who have tons of freedom in the US, it leads to all types of diseases, aggression, excessiveness, laziness, and more. Argument can be made both ways, and I can see both sides having solid points.
