    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, he didn&#39;t accomplish that but he did lower the population. </p>

<p>Way I see it GWB put Guantanamo in place and by doing so created a legal can of worms. The inmates were held under special circumstances that by the purest definition was illegal. </p>

<p>Now that it&#39;s gone on for so long we&#39;re dammed if we do and dammed if we don&#39;t. The ones who are left are probably pretty bad dudes. If they weren&#39;t when they started they are now. It&#39;d be irresponsible to just release them. On the other hand we can&#39;t bring them to the United States because doing so would bring them under our constitutional law. Laws that Guantanamo has violated from the start. The US can&#39;t allow the courts to work for the benefit of the inmates because the US knows that they fucked up in the first place.</p>

<p>The people responsible for making Guantanamo into the place it is should goto jail for the rest of their lives. Everyone &quot;just following orders&quot; should goto jail for 1-5 years. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think so. Bernie knows how the game is played and I think could have been very effective. If popular I think he could have easily endorsed candidates and changed the senate and the house. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know how else to say this. Anyone who is surprised by anything trump has (or hasn&#39;t) done so far was either incredibly uninformed during the election or they&#39;re simply genuinely stupid. </p>

<p>ALL the available information about trump was screaming and shouting that he was a dangerously incompetent, narcissistic demagogue with a weird obsession with putin. There&#39;s nothing partisan about this analysis, by the way. I have zero sympathy for the democrats and even I can see how objectively terrible trump is. There was absolutely no reason to believe he was going to &quot;drain the swamp&quot;. He can&#39;t finish a single sentence without blatantly lying about something and these people actually take him at his word, even now. They sit in their pro-trump meme echo chambers and make up their own fake reality. Sad!</p>
