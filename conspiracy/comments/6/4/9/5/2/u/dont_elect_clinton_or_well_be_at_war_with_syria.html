       Yeah, he didn't accomplish that but he did lower the population.
      </p>
      <p>
       Way I see it GWB put Guantanamo in place and by doing so created a legal can of worms. The inmates were held under special circumstances that by the purest definition was illegal.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now that it's gone on for so long we're dammed if we do and dammed if we don't. The ones who are left are probably pretty bad dudes. If they weren't when they started they are now. It'd be irresponsible to just release them. On the other hand we can't bring them to the United States because doing so would bring them under our constitutional law. Laws that Guantanamo has violated from the start. The US can't allow the courts to work for the benefit of the inmates because the US knows that they fucked up in the first place.

       What you're basically describing to me is a lack of accountability.
      </p>
      <p>
       The people responsible for making Guantanamo into the place it is should goto jail for the rest of their lives. Everyone "just following orders" should goto jail for 1-5 years.

       I think so. Bernie knows how the game is played and I think could have been very effective. If popular I think he could have easily endorsed candidates and changed the senate and the house.

       Very hard to know though. Entrenched power doesn't give it up easy.

       I don't know how else to say this. Anyone who is surprised by anything trump has (or hasn't) done so far was either incredibly uninformed during the election or they're simply genuinely stupid.

       ALL the available information about trump was screaming and shouting that he was a dangerously incompetent, narcissistic demagogue with a weird obsession with putin. There's nothing partisan about this analysis, by the way. I have zero sympathy for the democrats and even I can see how objectively terrible trump is. There was absolutely no reason to believe he was going to "drain the swamp". He can't finish a single sentence without blatantly lying about something and these people actually take him at his word, even now. They sit in their pro-trump meme echo chambers and make up their own fake reality. Sad!
