       This is starting to piss me off. Your typical searches online for
       <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt5724358/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1">
        Ukraine on Fire
       </a>
       keep flagging up Winter on Fire the
       <a href="https://consortiumnews.com/2017/02/13/a-documentary-youll-likely-never-see/">
        NED sponsored US propaganda opposite
       </a>
       film.
      </p>
      <p>
       Go to Youtube and search and you will find 9/10 hits will be to some sort of 2 hour shady pay to play video site. Search on torrents and you'll get the Russian TV version which is dubbed in Russian over the English soundtrack. Yes.. the English soundtrack so why it is not easily available to find for English?
      </p>
      <p>
       Talk about the weight of google and the deep state suppressing dissent. Even reviews of the film are scarce and sidelined to fringe sites or conspiracy hubs.
      </p>
      <p>
       Tell me I am wrong? Tell me it is all in my head. Better yet show me how easy it is to suppress a film by an award winning director across the Western world in the 21st century.

       Yeah, that's odd. Didn't even know the film existed until your post. You can get it with Spanish subs, but that's all I've found so far. Interesting that this Global Research article by James DiEugenio entitled "A Documentary Youâ€™ll Likely Never See" is what comes up when you search for the title.

       Also, the company claiming copyright is called Another Way Productions. They have exactly one credit on IMDB, and that's for Ukraine on Fire. Copyright not enforced for the Spanish version and not the English version? Odd.

       For a movie that has been out for over a year it is very odd. There were actual screenings of it at
       <a href="https://www.newcoldwar.org/oliver-stone-produced-ukraine-on-fire-premieres-at-film-festival-in-italy/">
        the   Taormina Film Festival
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       But that is it. Were really no DVD's made or supplied at the festival?
      </p>
      <p>
       It really starting to feel like a media blackout concerning and English film that goes against the MSM narrative about the Ukraine conflict.

       It's as if the producers made it strictly for Russia, and have purposely made it impossible for anyone to see in English. Over the years of hunting down documentaries online, not once have I been unable to find a recently made documentary.
      </p>
      <p>
       So I'd have to say, yes, the film is being blacked out - by the producers of the film. What a shame.

       By the producers or by the distributors? Imagine if US government decided to blacklist a film what better way then to make sure no worldwide distributor touches it. What is really odd is how even through no attributable sources like torrent only a dubbed version is available. Where was the original version they had to dub over in the first place ?

       Good question! I tried to play a video and got a message that it was taken down because of a copyright claim from Another Way Productions.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.anotherwayproductions.com/">
        http://www.anotherwayproductions.com/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       So, are these the producers? Probably not.  Are these the distributors? I don't know, but if they are, they're not distributing it, that's for sure. And the only credit for anything on their site is for Ukraine on Fire. Are these guys even legit? I'm tempted to contact them.

       Who would have thought a film by Oliver Stone would be so noncommercial? Guess winning awards mean nothing these days?

       I use duckduckgo, and no, this isn't a link to Ukraine on Fire. It's a suspicious site that you need to register for, and the link you provided is a faux link to the film. First you need to disable your ad-blocker, so I did that and reloaded. Then you can play, but the moment you do, you get the Twentieth Century Fox intro, and this clearly isn't a Twentieth Century Fox production.

       So I just discovered something about youtube. I clicked the Subtitle/CC from the video settings and got redirected to another page where it provides you with auto-generated subtitles that you can edit so they can be improved.  Doing this now. Hopefully someone who knows Russian can improve on them later. So far, their translate robot isn't too bad.

       Yeah.. but the film is English in the first place. So where is the original film they had to dub over in Russian so you can get your English subtitles?

      <p>
       From my experience the auto-caption thing is very hit and miss and does a really good job of mangling poor audio into something unreadable.

       Yeah, I know. How weird is it that the only way to watch this English language documentary film is to watch it dubbed in Russian? And a film produced by an American Oscar winning director? And by the look of it so far, they had a pretty decent budget. I'm sitting here now with the subtitle editor trying to catch mistakes as I'm hearing the Russian voice
       <em>
        over
       </em>
       the English narrator as I read what he says subtitled in machine-generated translation. It's fucked up.

       Nice.. but I want to see the interviews with the key people behind the events and their knowledge of what was really going on. According to what I can make out about Ukraine on Fire it uses direct questioning and frank admissions about how Nuland and her cookies were much more than a photo op.

       Thanks though.
