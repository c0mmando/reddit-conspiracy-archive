       I just wanted to say this. The people are so dumb that they forget what happened in 2013 when Russia threatened to intervene when Obama wanted to do air strikes. It is appalling that Reddit is so up in arms about one passenger who refused to give up his seat and was kicked off, but doesn't care about the Earth potentially being nuked. Could all this reaction against United be a distraction because of Shareblue or something?

       I would agree if those were Air Marshals but they were just United Security goon. It is not so unbelievable that some bully pricks got a badge, albeit an unimportant one, and became enraged that they weren't receiving "proper respect" for their "authority." Running back on the plane could simply be that the three security officers were accosted by their superiors and since they didn't cuff him, choosing instead to drag his limp body out of the plane, he got up and in shock went back to his seat repeating "I have to go home" and "they'll kill me" as his mind deals with what just happened.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think anything about it was fake but it was most certainly being helped along by the media to distract from what the now well respected President Trump is doing. Legacy Media is run by warmongers so now they want to protect him.

       They were officers from the "Chicago Department of Aviation Security." Not air marshals, but more than just United security goons.

        Viral video of a man being dragged off a United Airlines flight has virtually snuffed out any chance for city aviation security officers to be authorized to carry weapons, an influential alderman said Monday.

       That someone with a concussion is incapable of resisting a police officer or making it back onto a plane.  Many concussions go without being diagnosed for a good amount of time due to the symptoms not always being easy to notice.

       Cops are incompetent as fuck. Chicago PD put out a statement saying the man fucking fell. I'm sure your own eyes see that's a lie, and you wonder how they fucked up and let him run away and back onto the plane?

       1) WWIII + Draft
2) Economic collapse
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm leaning towards #2.  Italy/Germany's banks are about to collapse.  If France pulls out of EU, Euro will collapse &amp; likely every world economy with it.  While US economy is seeing best numbers since 1984, its a little to late.  The bubble will burst.
      </p>
      <p>
       Housing prices are just as bad as they were in 2008, if not worse.  Nothing is being done about it.  Obama stole 290 billion from Fannie/Freddy, which will compound the damage further &amp; we haven't even got into what is going on in the rental market.  In our area, renting an apartment has gone up 33% in 4 years.  Its skyrocketing everywhere because its "the market".

       Fixed that for you. This is exactly what the leaders want. They want you to not think about real world stuff and just work, work, work. This is a big part of the problem with the US. We work so much, when we finally get free time, we just want to relax, not worry about the country.

       That's the trick. things can only change when you're not fixeted on the outcome. Think about every relationship you had that fell apart. Every goal you failed to achieve. Everytime you gave up hope...was it because you were more focused on what wasn't going right, or what was?

       That's completely untrue. You are making very grand claims about the nature of reality. You are twisting things right around.
      </p>
      <p>
       I will tell you a small story of a time I was in Basic Training, to illustrate my point.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was in a fight, during combat training. A guy who was bigger than me got on top of me and pinned my shoulders with his knees and he choked me. The choke was illegal, so I waited for someone to stop the fight, but they never did. Rules can easily be overlooked when the person enforcing them just feels like it. Because I didn't fight back, I got choked out. In real life that is life or death. Afterwards somebody told me, "If you are ever in that situation you must wiggle with all your might to get an arm free."
      </p>
      <p>
       I never forgot that soldier's advice.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now of course there are times when struggling is bad, such as when being squeezed by a snake, or if you are in quicksand, but those are very particular moments. They are few and far between.
      </p>
      <p>
       You act like you are speaking some law of the universe. Haha I am a scientist in training. I can tell you that there are very few actual laws.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sorry your whole concept of reality is backwards and inside out. You've been brainwashed with new age spirituality. People literally get paid to create systems of beliefs, to keep the masses distracted. You fell for it. Please reconsider your course of action.

       good luck with whatever it is you are looking for from life. I found it. Nothing to reconsider. And I never spent more than a dime so how bad could it be? Why would I need to reconsider feeling good for free? This is my reality, my consciousness, and it works for me, so why should you pity me, or whatever it is you are doing?

       Look I think I get your point, but the language you are using is trapping you in a false reality. It happens to us all, but it is best to be aware of it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe you mean to say, that complaining about the problem doesn't help. We must actively work on a solution instead, which is of course wonderful advice! However the way you phrased it, it comes off as mystical experience. This is all, merely physical.

       I mean, if we are gonna dumb it down a ton, here it is: the law of attraction is about framing. If the only view of a situation you can understand is one from a perspective of lack, then how the hell are you supposed to identify aspects of the situation that are actually helpful.
      </p>
      <p>
       The law of attraction is about using a perspective of appreciation, gratiutude and compassion without having any attatchment to a specific outcome, which allows you to fully realize the situation at hand without the ego getting butthurt and too involved.
      </p>
      <p>
       With situations like this, with the possibility of war, by focusing on the "inevitable" you are driving that narrative home for the powers that be, regardless of whether or not it is true, which infects other people's perceptions and repeats the cycle.
      </p>
      <p>
       Buuuuut, in terms of the mystical, I will say that "thought-work" has done wonders in my life, in a seemingless effortless way to the spectators in my life. And by thought work I mean visualizing the win and selectively choosing which thoughts suit me and my needs, vs. bring on depression and anxiety and have no real value to me.

       The law of attraction works like trying to get out of quicksand. The more you struggle the faster you sink but if you do nothing you still sink. The only way out is to follow the 3rd way which is part of the lightworker code. Neither oppose nor accept the evil of this world but instead focus on what you DO want. Instead of opposing war people should be advocating peace. These are not the same thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is how the Russians diffused the situation in 2013. Instead of just saying no, no, no we oppose airstrikes they offered a 3rd way out. Assad and Russia agreed to turn over chemical weapons and the UN approved the inspections. The choice isn't just YES war or NO war. There is always a 3rd option.

       Yes, you'll get downvotes. Yes, people will reject what you've said and disagree/argue with you. But you'll be putting those ideas out there whether they like it or not.

       A Magician is a guy who gets up on stage and pulls rabbits out of hats and does card tricks. You are a young person who has never seen the art of "sleight of hand". When a Magician makes a coin disappear, it actually doesn't go anywhere...just out of your field of vision. So, by redirect I mean that the government shows you one thing to get your attention, and then, while you aren't looking does what they really want to do - in the hopes that you won't notice.

       There's enough rumblings on the Internet that Flynn was talking to Russia about convincing Putin to change their relationship with Assad.
      </p>
      <p>
       If Putin privately approved or even suggested the missile strikes... it's quite possible President Trump will be responsible for the biggest de-escalation of the perpetual middle eastern conflicts and the near century of Russian cold war and proxy conflicts.

       There's as much evidence Assad's government used chemical weapons as there was that Saddam had weapons of mass destruction. I.e. none. And it's far more likely the insurgents would use them to cause international reaction and further assistance in their efforts of toppling what once was a peaceful, progressive region of the ME.

       We are in complete agreement.  I'll go one further.  The toppling is to aid in the greater Israel project, it's all for scumbag Israel.  Netanyahu runs DC, and he wants that land, while many others want the resources.

       Yes this is most likely a staged distraction much like the gay concentration camp. People emotionally connect more with those stories because they have been seeing gay support in the media grow in the last ten years so that's the new PC thing to get behind and who doesn't feel outrage about a airline customer being violently ejected from an airplane for no valid reason. It's like someone trying to cheat at cards so they say "hey look over there!" So you turn away while they slip cards in and out. Like someone faking a seizure at the pharmacy to grab everyone's attention while a buddy slips behind the counter and steals drugs. Oldest trick in the book.

       I said it in another thread, and I'll say it again; what the fuck happened to the left in this country?  I remember back when Bush was president, they vehemently opposed the Iraq war.  But now that Trump is killing people in Syria and potentially dragging us into fucking WWIII, they are cheering him on, even though they Hated Trump and his pro war policies during the election.  I feel like the liberals in America are becoming the new conservatives.

       Ask them how they feel about war, kill their parents and friends in front of them.  Remind them about how they feel about war.  Now watch the cognitive dissonance.

       You realize that someone can be against war, but also have a differing sense of morality when things need to be done, like when a country attacks its own citizens with chemical weapons.

       I didn't realize a single sentence could be straw maned? I was just asking a question that seemed in line with the implications of your response.
      </p>
      <p>
       Given, that there is confirmed use of chemical weapons in Syria: I think you should seriously reconsider 'large' body of evidence, be more specific in regards to which attack you're referring to.

       Same here, but it seems the military-industrial complex are far more power than I imagined. I have watched
       <a href="https://youtu.be/CWiIYW_fBfY">
        Dwight D. Eisenhower's farewell speech
       </a>
       numerous times yet everytime I watch it seems more true.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm convinced no one leader can change this. The foundations of this government are soaked with blood and corruption to where the only way to fix this is to start anew. Weakening the federal government. They always taught us in school that the Articles of Confederation were much worse than the constitution and a strong federal government, but I'm not so true that is true anymore. If states rights were more important than local elections would be more significant and the people could change the course of our own country.

       If you really thought trump was anti intervention, I dare to say you selectively heard what you wanted. He decidingly road the fence on the topic. At times placating the more libertarian stance, at others clearly speaking speakibg towards a more militaristic stance. Once he put mad dog as the sec of war, the questions about his willingness to act should have been answered.
      </p>
      <p>
       But calm your tits on full blown intervention or regime change. In negotiations, it's not always good to take options off the table. Having the russians think we may act is in Trump's favor. He is not going to care about the peasents who think we might go to war being nervous. Until more happens, most are not going to be able to predict what is coming and that's a good thing. So, until more happens, to speculate is nothing more the an exercise in creativity.

       serious question here (i'm not even american), did you honestly expect trump to keep up with his promises even though he had been shown to be a liar ever since he started his campaign?

       Trump has already followed through with more of his campaign promises than Obama did in two terms. I really believe that Trump wants to move on from the whole Syria thing, but I'm willing to bet the pressure on him is insane. "The most powerful man in the free world" has a lot of people breathing down his neck.

       alright, good point. do you think any of these things, particularly undoing the environmental restrictions is actually going to do any good? i mean, undoing the restrictions will actually harm EVERYONE in the planet except some of the oil corporations.

       and because of people like trump and his friends it's been doomed for some time now. instead of doing something, even now, they choose to ignore it. did you know that exxon knew about man-made global warming and its consequences since the sixties but decided not to give a shit because it would've been bad for business? these people have been procrastinating for so long that they can now say "whoops, too late, let's keep on killing the biosphere because money."
instead of doing something, they have deceived the public for decades. and some of these people, including the leader of the free world, still claim the evidence is inconclusive. fuck them, i hope that these people are seen in the future as the cancer of humanity of our time.

       I am 100% not doubting this, which is why I say we've been doomed for ages. Every single president since JFK has not had the full freedom of implementing the changes they've wanted to. I just think that making such a big ruckus about it now (was there as much outrage 5-10 years ago? I remember learning in school that we had to do something soon to save our future generations... but we never did) is also counter-productive to the even more threatening issues at our doorstep (it's pretty hard to believe on top of the worsening environment threatening every one of us and our future children, that there's even worse and more threatening things, but alas, there is).
      </p>
      <p>
       This is all irrelevant from the initial point of Trump carrying through with his promises. Whether you disagree with it or not, the point was that he made a promise and carried through, so far he's having a MUCH better rate proportionally of carrying through on campaign promises than Obama ever did...
      </p>
      <p>
       So it's pretty funny to see people go "WOOOOOW you really thought Trump wouldn't lie? Really?
       <strong>
        You are the reason America is in shambles!
       </strong>
       " Yes, ofc he was going to lie, all of them do... it's about how much he lies, how corrupt he seems, what the ulterior motives are behind the actions (foreign influences, etc) and compared to Obama (up until the Syrian airstrikes which he picked up from the expert Barack himself) he's looked good (now that he has made this stance though, fuck him... ironic to see Liberals start supporting his actions now haha)

       jaja if only his campaign promises had been any good, then i would be applauding his honesty. also, what we do know to slow down the global warming would be very helpful to reduce the damage and have a better chance at having a smaller crisis. but then again, these politicians have 20-30 years of life ahead of them, so as long as they die rich, they don't fucking care. but apparently that hace absolutely no regard  for those of us that have 60-70 years left on this earth. oh well, but i guess we are doomed so fuck us and our children, right?

       Trust me, protesting in the street about Climate Change is not going to save our children. I hope in my lifetime to be able to do something that can actually contribute something somehow, but if you think political change is the answer, bahahahahahahahha

       You realise this is applicable to the last 100 years+ of politics and not just the Trump administration right? If anyone important enough was serious about climate change we wouldve done something years ago, the pressure on Trump is really no different than the pressure shouldve been on everyone before him. Oh well, keep complaining about the 'big issues in this world' that have only apparently come about in the last 2-4 months and have never been around for say, 100-1000 years

       dude, the difference is that at least obama believed in the paris agreement and actually made progress towards a cleaner environment. the fact that the president of the us supports these kinds of things motivates other countries to do the same. trump simply destroyed that view for many americans, which is very dangerous. i mean, it's not true as of yet, but some people were jokingly saying that germany were now the leaders of the free world. also, the fact that trump is pretty much in bed with russia strengthens this view. as a non-american, i can tell you that trump truly is destroying the image of the usa. but then again, some people in america might see it very differently.

       I certainly think that they will help big business... But that's irrelevant to my point, I was just saying that regardless of how you feel about Trump's policies, he is one of the more 'honest' presidents in recent history, insofar as he's actually following through on his campaign promises.

       We're likely only several generations away from science to directly control our climate or conversely making climate not really matter by bioengineering plants and foodstuff animals that just don't care.

       Next you have shit like where the EPA directly flooded that river with toxic waste water. The government is terrible at their job because they do too much. They spend so much time fucking over individual citizens and partying it up on their junkets they let the real problems be ignored or even manufacture themselves like with the waste water they dumped.

       Nope. Unfortunately, the media chose not to cover his policies nor the content of his rallies... instead focusing on controversy that gets clicks and $$$.
      </p>
      <p>
       He has said his plan was to rid the US of enemies like ISIS quickly, even if it meant glassing the middle east. He said that he would only engage if they could win, and if that win would be quick.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying I support all of his policies, but we should at least aim to be accurate in articulating why exactly we hate him, or where he has backflipped or lied.

        Wasnt Trump very anti war during his pre election? Genuinely curious bc I remember him saying shit that resonated like America doesn't need to be world police, we need to focus on ourselves etc etc?

       And he's getting BTFO by deep state, so he cut a deal.
      </p>
      <p>
       He's known for wanting to strike deals. That was part of what got him elected. He's also known for fighting back over some of the stupidest things, such as over a innuendo regarding the size of his hands. This is also part of what got him elected.
      </p>
      <p>
       He's a populist, and his position in negotiations is largely dependent on his public support. The media has successfully portrayed him as having virtually no public support, and so he has virtually no leverage in negotiations.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if he wanted to continue the Obama foreign policy doctrine, he has no means of achieving that within the bureaucracy that actually runs the country.

       If you watch the full Brian Williams clip and not just the part where he seems to have a stroke and ramble about how pretty the missile launches are, you'll see he's actually critical of the launches and doesn't think it was a good idea.
      </p>

       Realistically this is the last generation. The iGeneration were little children when 9/11 occured. Some may even remember it but wouldn't have understood it.

       The children of the iGeneration will be entirely disconnected from it.  It will merely be history book stuff to them the Pearl Harbor is to us.

       You're tripping. It isn't the left or the right. There are interventionists on both sides of the aisle. They were against Bush for reasons that have little to do with geo-politics.

       They are, but not solely in the form of interventionism.  There was a movement in the early 90s called
       <em>
        New Democrats
       </em>
       , where globalism was a focus, the educated upper classes sold out unionism and labor based politics, and quite honestly exactly what you implied happened. There's a pretty massive overlap between the economics policies of New Democrats and Globalist Republicans.

       neo-conservatives ---&gt; I'm actually not sure if this is true. The problem is that the neo-con label doesn't differentiate between the modern 'religious' right and globalist. I'm not convinced that the religious right actually is on board with corporatism except as a form of log rolling.

       They're one in the same, as far as I can see. Religion is the belief in a higher authority, which lends itself nicely to the authoritarianism inherent in corporate globalism.

       I don't know man, I don't know. I felt so detached from the democratic party this election that I re-registered as a green party member before the vote.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm primarily a pacifist and the left used to feel so peaceful. We wanted to end the war in Iraq, end the war in Afghanistan, bring the troops home. This was a promise made by Obama and why I supported him.
      </p>
      <p>
       ... it literally took one generation and suddenly we're all about intervention in the middle east? What in the living fuck happened? This shit scares me. How can minds can change so quick?
      </p>
      <p>
       Was it the generation after ours? Was it that they grew up and started losing their pacifist beliefs? Is Hillary saying we need to intervene and passing around a picture of a hurt child all people need as evidence?
      </p>
      <p>
       They made it
       <em>
        humanitarian
       </em>
       to want to go into the middle east. They made it about saving babies. They figured out how to get into our heads. I think this is the primary cause for the drastic change, and I think that they know they can keep the military industrial complex happy and the people happy with the right spin.
      </p>
      <p>
       What scares me is that I think they perfected their methods of control over public opinion. I think they amalgamated all their data sources, twitter, facebook, reddit, and used statistics to figure out how to sway public opinion and see how to spin something and visually get an idea if that method worked. I think simply by having a platform to do analysis like that, that's all they need for total control over the public.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's the ultimate propaganda analysis machine. You drop a sound bite, you watch the meter go up or down. I think that's what it boils down to these days. The internet has freed us and allowed us to make a difference as individuals, but it's also allowed us to be controlled as a group. We built our own Orwellian future without even knowing it. We built the platform that would be perfect to control us. We built it, and they tapped its potential.

       Its built up too much momentum. We can't stop kids from getting in on this without taking away ALL of their smartphones. We made them subject to the propaganda from the start. Four year olds have smart phones these days. We plugged them in willingly. From the cradle to the grave, the social media addiction will persist. We are social creatures and this lets us always be connected to friends and family. Those with money realized they could buy the data, tap it, throw engineering resources at it, analyze it. They realized that with that information, it's enough to influence our thoughts. Benign reasons, but villainous applications.
      </p>
      <p>
       The average person isn't dumb, but the average person is emotional and reacts. By knowing exact responses of the public's reaction, they can predict reactions we'll have to any sort of event. With that knowledge, all it takes is spin.
      </p>
      <p>
       We need a revolution in
       <em>
        privacy, media consumption, and behavior
       </em>
       in order to combat what they've done. This will need to be in part an education into methods that give us immunity to analysis at this scale. We need a revolution in
       <em>
        investigation
       </em>
       , open source and publicly funded investigation into the truth behind the pictures, the truth behind the politician's statements. We need investigators that can't be compromised if they exist, people willing to call out bullshit when they see it and make politicians accountable for the lies they spew and propaganda we see. We need
       <em>
        independent and unbiased
       </em>
       journalism that NEVER talks to politicians outside of an interview with a mic. We have watched the quality of our news go down a million fold. MSM plans events with politicians, spews bias, spews propaganda, no restraint. We need to enforce criminal laws for this sort of behavior.
      </p>
      <p>
       Compromised media is their mouth, and social media is their eyes. We have to cut both out in order to change.

       Once again I'll come off as a pretentious douche but I can speak for myself(and clearly many others on this sub) when I saw that I don't believe something just because CNN or Fox says it's true. I try to read every source I can and come to a conclusion. It seems like many simply chose to not care or put in the effort to think for themselves.

       My experience engaging with people on these questions (mostly Americans) whom I know in real life, and this is purely anecdotal, but it's my subjective experience: is this:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        People do not know have a clear picture what is going on
       </li>
       <li>
        Perhaps due to this lack of basic knowledge, they often do not particularly want to have a conversation; the conversation is uncomfortable (again this varies)
       </li>
       <li>
        They have a lot of presuppositions in their thinking, and are more-or-less willing to discuss these premises. For some, the ideas are so entrenched they are simply unwilling to have a conversation
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       My experience talking to persons from the Middle East that they are far better informed, have a grasp of the facts. They also have strong premises that inform their worldview and may or may not be open to discussion. At the least their premises lead to a coherent worldview.

       I don't watch the news.  I barely read news articles.  Most of the "newsworthy" shit I get is from
       <a href="/r/worldnews">
        /r/worldnews

       .  And that's if it makes it to my front page.  I prefer pictures of cats and children falling over.  Please keep this in mind.
      </p>
      <p>
       One or two days ago, there were a shit ton of posts (that I admittedly scrolled past because I am a selfish piece of shit and just want to feel good) about people protesting all over the place due to corrupt governments.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is one post today about China sending 150k troops to the NK border.  Nothing more about Syria.  Nothing about protests.  No shit about Russian ties or whatever.  Reddit is flooded with posts about United Airlines.  Well.. maybe this is not entirely fair.
       <em>
        My
       </em>
       Reddit is flooded with posts about UA.
      </p>
      <p>
       Obviously Reddit isn't the only source for information, and I likely just subscribe to shitty subs, so this could be and maybe is a garbage observation.
      </p>
      <p>
       I will rejoin my box of wine and see if other news sources are addressing these things.  Just some drunk. potentiallu irresponsible musings I guess.

       Here's the thing, literally anyone with on the ground experience or formal training in this subject is immediately subjected to massive ignorance due to the nature of the audience here. Attempting to have a nuanced discussion about Debaathification, Kurdish Separatism, or Iranian regional hegemony is like pulling teeth.

       I'd be more than willing to provide the non-strawman arguments for American intervention, where I think the mistakes happened, where I think the Russians are doing well, and why I think that push comes to shove I'd rather see Iranian hegemony than Saudi, but  I refuse to get looped into pointless argument where someone links the first twenty articles provided by google on why the US created IS.

       My biggest gripe currently with out foreign policy is that foreigners have a better understanding of what the US is engaged in than Americans do.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is a level of classified bullshit that should not be tolerated.
      </p>

       And, from a strategic standpoint, it doesn't make sense, unless the intention is to turn America into an open police state.

       Then again, it's not much longer that we can sustain this. Even without a collapse of the price of oil, there's going to be a collapse of the US dollar.
      </p>
      <p>
       The conditions are not in place to repeat anything approaching the boom years experienced in the past, our debt is only growing and the budget isn't trajecting in a sustainable direction so much as it's tragic.
      </p>
      <p>
       Meanwhile, our best and brightest seem determined to either continue strangling the globe into submission, or chasing after fantastical dreams of becoming the leaders in alternative energy, as if the Chinese won't steal all our designs either directly when we have them manufacture the components, or indirectly when they have the Russians hack our networks.

       I just posted this on a video re:united incident, but shit is obviously engineered. Who the fuck tries or succeeds to get on a plane after being forcibly dragged off by goons wearing shirts that say POLICE. Also, this guy who was dragged off is so fucking famous, late-night hosts are doing elaborate sketches less than 24 hrs after, social and mainstream media carrying the story like it's 9/11 part deux, CEOs releasing statements and press conferences about this,  but no one knows the guy's fucking NAME. Meanwhile, in the background, WW3 is about to start

       Well the government wouldn't have any power if people didn't listen to them.

       US soldiers could protest and refuse to follow orders unless there is an active invasion. It's not like they can do anything about.

      <p>
       This is what the Iraqis soldiers do. They just take the weapons and defect to the Islamic State.

       The people could refuse follow laws that don't make sense. And they could fight anyone that harasses them.

       This is how the Muslims do things. Government not taking care of you or abusing powers? No problem just refuse to listen to them do as you wish and if they harass you wage Jihad against them.

       He is on the verge of losing his medical license again after getting it back. He is already restricted to one day a week at an out patient clinic. He lost it the first time for giving out pain killers like candy to anyone and exchange sex for a medical bill. He was ignorant on what happens if you don't follow the law.

       United Airlines overbooked their flight when they NEEDED those seats. When people wouldn't volunteer they should have kept offering more vouchers until someone accepted. Instead they drag this guy off even though he paid and booked in advance? How is this not United's fault?

       That's the risk he took when he refused to follow the rules. He first agreed with being bumped and getting a cash voucher for bumping him with his wife until he learned the delay could be up to 24 then he refused to get off. The moment he refused to get off he broke the contract of carriage you enter when buying a ticket. He flat out refused to move even after airport security was called. At the point in the video he could be considered resisting arrest. When air port security asks you to leave you have to comply or risk federal and state charges.

       When you buy a ticket the fine print says they can do this if they need to do it. If someone got into your car after you agreed to give them a ride for a few bucks but they were an asshole and you wanted them to get out what would you do? Let's say you called a cop to remove them and they refused to leave after the cop told them to what do you expect to happen? If they resisted arrest and fought against being pulled out of your car is it your fault that he got hurt?

       Even if you don't like the policies you agree to them when you buy a ticket. It doesn't matter what reason you feel like you deserve to stay on the plane because by taking the ticket you entered into a legal contract with the airlines. In the contract it says if you don't leave the plane when asked you will be removed by airport security. Of course UA handled the whole thing poorly and the officer went over board removing the guy but it is all within their legal rights as owner of the airplane.

       Well, she is Chinese and I asked her will the fact that this guy is Vietnamese affect her opinion, and she said no, she still retains the idea that United is an idiot. I know it's not that far off, but honestly, the Chinese barely acknowledge the Vietnamese. Some don't even know where it is on a map.

       Those in the peasant class. Particularly those on reddit are far more concerned with emotions and immediate surroundings rather than logic and reality.

      <p>
       "panem et circenses" Or Bread and Circuses is the most effective strategy for populace appeasement since the roman days.

      <p>
       Now the Peasants are given TV,Movies,Video games, Sports, MSM. 
At such a scale that an entire lifetime would not even scratch the surface of what is superfically consumeable.

       Take my roommate for instance. The guy has watched thousands of TV shows and series. Going through "Thats sunny in Phili" 4-5 times. Put in up to a week in Fall out 4...etc. The list goes on and on. The second the kids done with school. The TVs on.

       So true in a sense(but the upper middle class and wealthy are also the same so it is not a "peasant thing"), and the sad thing is that is that people care about more about fictional characters and their fake suffering, than the real suffering in the world of the downtrodden. Indeed since they spend so much time with entertainment industry nonsense they will believe the capitalist propganda that the poor create their own misery, rather than realizing they are the victims of a social hierarchy where money makes money and conversely where poverty is more often than not passed down from generation to generation.

       I'll agree the professional class or merchant class in feudal comparison may be even more indoctrinated than the skilled and unskilled classes. They consume large amounts of NY TIMES, Investment, and Business propaganda which is littered with agenda.
      </p>
      <p>
       They bought into the system fully (higher education(master/phd), pharmaceutical drug dealers(doctors), system leeches such as divorce lawyers/lawyers and are awarded accordingly ($$$).
      </p>
      <p>
       Enough wealth is dished out to the professional class to give the poor incentive and potential to attain such status, when it reality it rarely is, even with hard work. Money makes Money.
      </p>
      <p>
       This leads to something called "David Humes(economist) Demostrative Effect".
      </p>
      <p>
       Where luxury purchased by the Professional Class is envied by the lower classes and is purchased by them, regardless if they can afford it or not. Usually on Credit, which leads to debt-servitude and more profit for the oligarchical class.

       Using recreational activities is okay if done in moderation. The OPs roommate doesn't sound like moderation in the slightest. Now remember that the average american watches 5 hours of TV per day and tell me that the average citizen isn't wasting their time. 5 hours on top of working an additional 8 doesn't leave much room for things that matter.

       No. An hour or two of recreation is all that you need to be happy day to day but for overall self actualization there needs to be something more than just play in free time.

       Perhaps for yourself and those around you. Everyone's brain makes connections differently. There are people who behave the exact opposite and are very happy and sure of their person. How can you say you know the end all be all for every person. I maybe spend ten hours a week looking at reddit/watching tv and I am quite an unhappy person. Just because it can affect you negatively does not mean it is the same for everyone.

       Go back to highschool with that type of thinking. Anyopme that sits and consumes all day is not suite of themselves. They can't cope with boredom and thus must be occupied by frivolous things. Just look at religion and how its a coping mechanism for death and life's great mysteries. They never question the reality that is fed to them. Life is more than watching football on TV and drinking beer, its just a matter of actively pursuing something more that will make one truely happy within. You can disagree all you want, but there is more to life than TV, video games, and social media.

       And if you live in a developed country chances are you're in the 1%. The modern "peasant class" in countries like the US live much better lives than in the past. The biggest reason the "peasant class" would ever feel a part of that class is by looking at how much richer some other people are. That makes comments like yours what creates the "peasant class".

       That's not my point at all. While we do certainly have poverty, and I'm not trying to say that the problems that the poor in our country face aren't valid or even that they deserve to be poor, but that's a lot different than having a permanent peasant class.

       How would you differentiate a peasant class from intergenerational poverty in the US?

       By that social status being imposed by a shadowy oligarchy working together to keep you down so they'll have a labor force. That doesn't exist. In fact those taxes that us "peasants" pay go towards funding for public schools so that people like the author above are less likely to drop out of school due to poverty and hopefully have a chance of making it out. If we really had a permanent peasant class we either wouldn't have public schools or this shadowy oligarchy would sabotage them so that they'd be so terrible anyone trying to advance in their education wouldn't stand a chance. Neither one of those is the case

       I didn't say it did, but this conversation was about whether a permanent peasant class exists or not. If a permanent peasant class is one not just stuck in poverty but hopelessly stuck in poverty because of a cynical oligarchy oppressing them then that article isn't really talking about the same thing. So in a way my point was that you're right, the article isn't talking about generational poverty in the same way that the rest of this thread is.

       And that's a fair point but the 1% number isn't really accurate for the kind of wealth bring described. The cut off for the 1% is about $400k a year I think and while that's certainly very well off that's not so well off that you don't have to work.

       It's kinda odd. I don't wanna make that kinda money (in the process of taking the LSAT(s) until I score high enough to study law on a good scholarship--so long-term potential is there). My thought process is that I would like to maintain my comfortable minimalism. I am a fiercely anticonsumerist bargain basement dweller and shun most activities requiring a lot of $$. I don't own much and basically purchase only what I wear and consume

       The Household MEDIAN income is like 56k.

       Well yeah... The wealthy that don't have to work aren't the 1% though. They make up maybe 1% of the 1%. And part of the reason they don't have to work is because they haven't built up that wealth in the form of money but in assets like land, companies etc. They've made their money work for them which is just good money management. Either way producing (or working), paying taxes, and consuming is everybody's place in the world if you want to be utilitarian about it. That's why we all try to find meaning in life in other ways so it shouldn't be surprising that they see us as potential consumers. Everyone is a potential consumer including the 1% you're talking about.

       And UBI is usually only even considered because there's this fear that automation will slowly take everyone's jobs so eventually it will be a necessary evil. I don't know if I buy that but I can at least understand the train of thought.

       I agree with you for the most part, but I don't give a shit how others live their lives honestly. Saying they're doing things with their lives wrong is pretty closed minded.  Other people want different things out of their lives.

       Reddit is large enough that I think a statistician could make an argument that it is a significant enough sample to make determinations about the whole.

       Reddit itself is merely a representation of a very small number of humans on Earth. Out of 5bl people there are only 15ml using reddit. That is not even a percentage point.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, it must be understood that the hive here has the ability to get one of their misdirected individuals to do something illegal, or unethical, from time to time.
      </p>
      <p>
       This should really be closely scrutinized, that a website has the ability to harness the uneducated and disturbed to do illegal and/or unethical actions, exacerbated by lying about content and context.

       That is true in the sense that Reddit usually expresses white neckbeard and nerd opinion. But in this case the OP is correct, no one in the USA cares when brown people are bombed and millions of their lives are ruined by Western military interventions, they care more that they could potentially also as airline passengers be kicked off a flight.

       Frankly, I think that criticism of reddit isn't true.  It's not going to give you a perfectly balanced population representative of all the views and diversity within our country, but you'll get a better sense then from most other media platforms.
      </p>
      <p>
       I wasn't surprised that HRC lost, for example, because I saw it coming on reddit.

       It is very interesting that we all came together in outrage over the mistreatment of the doctor, at a time when we can hardly agree on anything.
      </p>
      <p>
       Does it have anything to do with the huge role corporations play in our lives these days?  It's almost like they are a third government, and we care about how they treat us.

       It was only revealed recently on Wikileaks that the U.S. wishes to overthrow Assad to help defend Israel
       <a href="https://wikileaks.org/clinton-emails/emailid/18328">

      <p>
       Where do you expect the public to learn of these geopolitics? The mass media? Public schools? By scouring Wikileaks and "conspiracy" (independent media) sites daily?
      </p>
      <p>
       The media has so conditioned the populace that, prior to the Wikileaks release, even thinking U.S. involvement in Syria was related to Israel would have been considered an anti-Semitic thought crime.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course, still no one is paying attention and people don't understand Syria is a front in the reheated Cold War proxy war - this time between Israel/U.S. and Iran/Russia. They either buy the humanitarian aspect pushed by the media, or at most the cynical suspect war profiteering.
      </p>
      <p>
       And with Google and Facebook slapping "debunked by Snopes" on independent media, and YouTube censoring videos, our jobs of educating the pubic have become harder.

       huh? Is that happening? I've seen plenty from the left criticizing Trump over Syria. The only people I see praising Trump (even in this thread) are, shockingly enough, Trump supporters. (Although I've also seen a fair few Trump supporters bail, or at least hesitant, over the Syria stuff)

       Assad is allegedly responsible for the chemical weapons attack. I'm in the camp that believes the attack was a false flag. Why would Assad use chemical weapons now when there were peace talks taking place?
      </p>
      <p>
       The US is amassing warships and troops in the middle eastern gulf region. China and the US are amassing troops around North Korea. Russia and Iran have vowed to attack on American troops if there is any further escalation against Assad.
      </p>
      <p>
       My take is that Trump ordered the missle strike as a retaliation and nothing more, but McMaster is pulling the strings and is trying to coerce the US into taking out Assad and ISIS where Trump only wanted to take out ISIS. If we try to take out Assad, the Russians won't take that lying down and we will have a full blown war on our hands.

       I think it's because people feel they can actually have an affect on United's sales by spreading these posts and bring justice to that poor man. People feel they have no control or voice when it comes to world politics and give up trying to make a difference or protest the seeming "unstoppable war machine"..

       I think they are two different issues that have different implications.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Syrian issue is harder for the American public to think critically on because of how cable news portrays it. Also I think people also feel removed from the issue and those in power are going to do what they want to do. I'm not sure if that is the case, just a thought.
      </p>
      <p>
       With the United Airlines issue, I think it is easier for people to relate to that. Majority of Americans have been on a plane, and it is easy to sympathize sympathize with the injustice against someone who is just like us.
      </p>
      <p>
       I guess for me, they are both important issues, Syria is important because of geopolitical tensions, United Airlines is important because how they responded to it paints a bleak picture of corporate power in America.

       I'm pretty pissed off about both. The United Airlines incident is taxpayer funded terrorism (remember, it was the police, not United, that made this man bleed from his mouth) against the American people. And of course our involvement in world events is all kinds of screwed up. I imagine it's easier for most people to latch on to the UA incident because it happened in the United States.

       Energy flows where attention goes. Don't mind the elephant in the living room, just keep watching the tele. Interesting enough that when it comes to distraction from major issues, EMOTION is what is absolutely neseccary to produce. Because when you're experiencing strong emotion, you stop thinking, you stop analyzing.

       People are mad about a corporation acting like they can do whatever they want and ignoring bulkshit fear mongering about a WW3 that's never going to happen because of MAD. Sounds like OP is the moronic one.

       The United Airlines story is tangible, visual, requires no thought on the end result. Its easy to see a 10 second video and speak out after seeing it.

       The WW3 possibility is an uncertainty, something that requires critical thinking, research and effort.

       No one is going to nuke anyone. Countries have immensely more to lose by using a nuke than by not using them. The only people you should be afraid of with nukes are small orginizations getting ahold of one or NoKo finally losing it.

       War is always a possibility, but the idea of mutually assured destruction keeps nukes off the table imo. No way to go about nuking without getting nuked. Everyone has em, no body uses em. Only america has ever dropped nukes on a real population. Don't forget that.

       I would argue that people waking up to corporate abuse in the transportation sector is more relevant.  It is narrow micro issues that the critical mass can turn on and make ideological headway against the powers that be.  Indeed TPTB are the corporate overlords, not Donald Trump.  In any case, some "WWIII" movement is tied into corporate hegemony anyways.

       I agree, and Trump hasn't acted since the airstrikes (but eventually he will) so some people's fears of WWIII have had a chance to subside a bit. But also the United thing is another scary reminder of our police state so no wonder why people are horrified by that right now.

       People are ignoring anything to do with NK because it's NK and it will always end in them crying and doing nothing, maybe shooting another missile into the ocean and grandstanding about it. Eventually the truth about how fucked their country is will reach the people living in it and they'll starve to death frowning in disbelief or they'll rise up and hang Un and put someone in charge who isn't a psychopath with a god complex.
      </p>

       WW3 is never going to happen. No one country is going to attempt to take over the world anymore by force. It can't be done. Logically, almost physically, it cannot be done. WW3 will not be fought by nukes it will be fought in our hearts and minds. No one is worrying about a nuclear apocalypse because it is never going to happen, not now, not ever, everyone loses in a nuclear war. Everyone. Us, them, the Illuminati, the Jihadi's whose holy lands are reduced to radioactive rubble, everyone loses. The mad scientist or crazy super villian that wants to end all life on the planet, and is capable, does not exist outside of film.
      </p>
      <p>
       People aren't worried about WW3 or Earth-nuking because
       <em>
        it is not going to happen ever, ever, ever,
       </em>
       it's the stupidest and most short-sighted idea of a strike and would be thrown out of any high-level conspiracy meeting between the elite. I can't stress that enough. Just put yourself in the shoes of some high-authority elite mug, why in Satan's demonic nutsack would you blow up the fucking planet you're living on, that you've worked centuries to control and develop? It's not about nukes, it's about image.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why blow half the world up to control what's left when you can simply mesmerize them with dancing lights and sounds and use them to build and consolidate your power? Even better, they
       <em>
        want
       </em>
       it. Lots of people just want to be left alone, to live their simple lives amongst the consumerism rush from one movie to the next game to the next scandal and cycle repeat.

       Well most people are assholes and taught the world revolves around them, their comfort and entertainment. Look at Reddit is just

       The mostly white college or college track audience of Reddit and that writes about politics online doesn't care about all the brown, black and marginally white people(like the constituent nations of the destroyed Yugoslavia full of failed states where all the youth want to emigrate) that their militaries and foreign policies destroy. What they care about is that they could be on an overbooked flight and inconvenienced.

       We both know that if Hilary

       got in, and pulled the exact same shit in Syria as Trump did (ie throw America back in another Middle East war, oh, and effectively ally America with ISIS), you'd be screaming "WW3".

       People outraged over a fellow consumer being treated poorly is reasonable. Especially in that fashion.

       However, we can't do anything about our governments choices. If cannabis is still federally illegal, we don't have a say in shit. Especially when it comes to other countries violating cornerstones of the geneva convention.

       This is why I still believe popular vote shouldn't matter, but of course our voting representatives are corrupt af.  The mass majority of people are just idiots swayed by the slightest imagery.  Look at the Szechuan sauce thing, 99% of people had never tried it, for all we know it's just BBQ and sweetnsour.

       My family has been personally fucked over by United airlines by outsourcing. When that particular business has troubles, I can't help but try to make life harder for them. I also do not want boots on the ground in Syria and I wish President Trump didn't bomb that base. The United airlines thing was nice because people on the left and right can equally hate something and unite. Can't always be 100% engaged in politics.

       Wha? Isn't that backwards? Trump bombed Syria- surely the shadowy, omnipotent Shareblue would want to bring attention to that, to criticize Trump?

       If anyone would want to run interference right now, it's Trump (or his allies/supporters). (not that I think that happened, but it makes 100x more sense than Shareblue )

       That's the thing: Trump's Syrian action actually makes him look
       <em>
        good
       </em>
       to a lot of people - liberal media included. Shareblue can't have positive Trump news going on, and they can't exactly spin it because everyone agrees gassing people is bad, so the best play to make is to get people to stop talking about it.

       I haven't seen much positive media, or positive public reaction, outside places like The_Donald (and, although many there backed Trump's move, I saw more negative reaction from Trump supporters than I've ever seen over anything else he did. Shit, even Ben Garrison and Richard Spencer basically ditched Trump over Syria). Most mainstream media stuff I've seen has been wary at best. At worst they talk about the possibility of WW3. Nothing I'd call "positive", at all.

       Of course every knows Assad is a scumbag. But everyone also realises it's much, much more complex than that, with Russia and ISIS in the mix, let alone worries about Trump's first major military issue, lack of congressional approval, etc.

       The difference - credible reporting by media companies. More effort is placed on broadcasting far and wide sensationalist anger-generating topics, with little impact on the political landscape, than on complex topics facing the country and decisions trees coming out of it.
      </p>
      <p>
       If anything when I view traditional broadcast and printed media there is a sense of glee in the drum-up toward war - as if they are EAGER for a 'weapons of mass destruction in Iraq' excuse to kill and maim other humans. It's sickening.

       Because they feel like they can change United, and do not feel like they can change the deep state.

       I think people are channeling their outrage in to things they think they can affect, which is logical behavior. However we can change our government more than most of us realize.

       I think it was an outrage at first, but at the rate its been going, it's probably airline competitors posting it to social media including reddit.

       I agree mostly, but some reasons why this is important too
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        It's about the police state, and corporate/police collusion.
       </li>
       <li>
        It shows that if an MD on a airplane can be beaten for nothing, then you can be anytime-- and certainly if you protest them in any way.
       </li>
       <li>
        The fact that personal info about this MD has been released, shows that corporations have instant access to the surveillance/ police state's dossier on everyone.

       People have their "source" for news and tend to stick to it. I'm not sure about news feeds. Google's will occasionally allow RT into it. The liberal media cheered the airstrikes as it and the deep state felt Trump was "under their control." Even though the action was reckless. Anyone who pays attention to Russian media knows their not fucking around. Once Bannon was removed from the NSC this bullshit happens.

       They are 2 sides of the same coin. Destabilization of 3rd world governments furthers the cause of globalism. Corporations committing crimes against humanity with absolute impunity is just a symptom of corporatocracy. Who are the major players trying to bring about the new world order? Bankers, CEOs, the rich. It's all one big master plan to bring us all together under a universal plutocracy. There is no coincidence, only consequence.

       Right now a liberal would support anything against Putin because they believe BS about Russian Interference and they are all mad about his supposed human rights abuses. That he is bent on world domination (ironic)
      </p>
      <p>
       A standard conservative would believe similarly less or more hawkish as interference is not as big an issue nor are gay rights. Trump supporters would be skeptical he is being controlled by "globalists"

       North Korea had it coming.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump should have spilled the beans on ISIS &amp; the CIA , and focus most of his foreign policy of his term on Working with China to eliminate the North Korean government.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the North Korean government was overthrown &amp; the world were to see the living conditions there, and if Trump didn't bomb Syria then we might have seen Trump's ratings jump quite high, like what happened to Bush after 9/11.
      </p>
      <p>
       If Kim is cocky enough to kill his brother with VX in a foreign  public airport then he has to go, VX is so dangerous that Kim could have killed hundreds in the airport by accident. Kim's brother was the ACE card of the Chinese.
      </p>
      <p>
       I wouldn't be surprised if what's happening to North Korea is a deal that China struck with Trump, the deal would allow trump  to smack North Korea around. China would let Trump do that to put Kim in his place. The troop deployment is probably Refugee control.

       I've been thinking about this too and it comes down to one simple thing. People can relate to how this guy was treated. There was really no barrier between what we saw on someone's personal Twitter video and the public. The Syrian conflict has many layers to the onion that get convoluted by what news network you're watching and their agenda. It also does not affect everyone's daily lives like flying an airplane can. People think, "what if that was me?" People see war in a third world and think, "the problem is on the other side of the world, why should I care?"
      </p>
      <p>
       People that care about what's happening in geopolitical warfare like OP and everyone else here actually care because we see beyond the headlines and the bigger picture.

       World war 3 will never start because of nuclear weapons. It's called deterrence. If Russia for whatever reason nuked the US, Russia would no longer exist. The us would survive.

       The American people have been shilled with fear-mongering of WW3 since August 1945.

      <p>
       At this point, no one's using nukes, at least not until enough nations have nukes that nukes could reliably be used in a false flag.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's as good a reason as any to prevent other nations from developing nukes.

       I'm wondering how the chinese guy got back on the flight after he was dragged off? There is a video of him where he re-emerges on the plane (without any security people) and is pacing back and forth talking about "he has to get home."

       We don't get a say in important matters like wars. That stuff is decades in the making - "foreign policy".

       I've noticed worrying things people can't control they avoid thinking/talking about. Especially in places like work for example.

       IMO the opposite is true.

       The more attention we give it the more we focus on that one specific, and horrible, outcome. Which directly validates the legitimacy of said outcome.

       Fixed that for you. This is exactly what the leaders want. They want you to not think about real world stuff and just work, work, work. This is a big part of the problem with the US. We work so much, when we finally get free time, we just want to relax, not worry about the country.

       If you watch the full Brian Williams clip and not just the part where he seems to have a stroke and ramble about how pretty the missile launches are, you'll see he's actually critical of the launches and doesn't think it was a good idea.
      </p>

       But yeah, that 8 second clip of the other guy saying 'Trump became president Trump' that's definitely some positive coverage that I hadn't seen (so you got me there).

       Now, how you go from one guy on one station being positive to "liberal media fawning over attacks" like the title of that video, I don't know.
