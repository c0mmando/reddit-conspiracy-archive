The people are so dumb that they forget what happened in 2013 when Russia threatened to intervene when Obama wanted to do air strikes.

    <div class="md"><p>I would agree if those were Air Marshals but they were just United Security goon. It is not so unbelievable that some bully pricks got a badge, albeit an unimportant one, and became enraged that they weren&#39;t receiving &quot;proper respect&quot; for their &quot;authority.&quot; Running back on the plane could simply be that the three security officers were accosted by their superiors and since they didn&#39;t cuff him, choosing instead to drag his limp body out of the plane, he got up and in shock went back to his seat repeating &quot;I have to go home&quot; and &quot;they&#39;ll kill me&quot; as his mind deals with what just happened.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think anything about it was fake but it was most certainly being helped along by the media to distract from what the now well respected President Trump is doing. Legacy Media is run by warmongers so now they want to protect him.</p>

<p>Viral video of a man being dragged off a United Airlines flight has virtually snuffed out any chance for city aviation security officers to be authorized to carry weapons, an influential alderman said Monday.</p>

<p>1) WWIII + Draft
2) Economic collapse</p>

<p>I&#39;m leaning towards #2.  Italy/Germany&#39;s banks are about to collapse.  If France pulls out of EU, Euro will collapse &amp; likely every world economy with it.  While US economy is seeing best numbers since 1984, its a little to late.  The bubble will burst.  </p>

<p>Housing prices are just as bad as they were in 2008, if not worse.  Nothing is being done about it.  Obama stole 290 billion from Fannie/Freddy, which will compound the damage further &amp; we haven&#39;t even got into what is going on in the rental market.  In our area, renting an apartment has gone up 33% in 4 years.  Its skyrocketing everywhere because its &quot;the market&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s completely untrue. You are making very grand claims about the nature of reality. You are twisting things right around.</p>

<p>I will tell you a small story of a time I was in Basic Training, to illustrate my point.</p>

<p>I was in a fight, during combat training. A guy who was bigger than me got on top of me and pinned my shoulders with his knees and he choked me. The choke was illegal, so I waited for someone to stop the fight, but they never did. Rules can easily be overlooked when the person enforcing them just feels like it. Because I didn&#39;t fight back, I got choked out. In real life that is life or death. Afterwards somebody told me, &quot;If you are ever in that situation you must wiggle with all your might to get an arm free.&quot;</p>

<p>I never forgot that soldier&#39;s advice. </p>

<p>Now of course there are times when struggling is bad, such as when being squeezed by a snake, or if you are in quicksand, but those are very particular moments. They are few and far between.</p>

<p>You act like you are speaking some law of the universe. Haha I am a scientist in training. I can tell you that there are very few actual laws.</p>

<p>Sorry your whole concept of reality is backwards and inside out. You&#39;ve been brainwashed with new age spirituality. People literally get paid to create systems of beliefs, to keep the masses distracted. You fell for it. Please reconsider your course of action.</p>

<p>good luck with whatever it is you are looking for from life. I found it. Nothing to reconsider. And I never spent more than a dime so how bad could it be? Why would I need to reconsider feeling good for free? This is my reality, my consciousness, and it works for me, so why should you pity me, or whatever it is you are doing?</p>

<p>I believe you mean to say, that complaining about the problem doesn&#39;t help. We must actively work on a solution instead, which is of course wonderful advice! However the way you phrased it, it comes off as mystical experience. This is all, merely physical.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mean, if we are gonna dumb it down a ton, here it is: the law of attraction is about framing. If the only view of a situation you can understand is one from a perspective of lack, then how the hell are you supposed to identify aspects of the situation that are actually helpful. </p>

<p>The law of attraction is about using a perspective of appreciation, gratiutude and compassion without having any attatchment to a specific outcome, which allows you to fully realize the situation at hand without the ego getting butthurt and too involved.</p>

<p>With situations like this, with the possibility of war, by focusing on the &quot;inevitable&quot; you are driving that narrative home for the powers that be, regardless of whether or not it is true, which infects other people&#39;s perceptions and repeats the cycle. </p>

<p>Buuuuut, in terms of the mystical, I will say that &quot;thought-work&quot; has done wonders in my life, in a seemingless effortless way to the spectators in my life. And by thought work I mean visualizing the win and selectively choosing which thoughts suit me and my needs, vs. bring on depression and anxiety and have no real value to me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The law of attraction works like trying to get out of quicksand. The more you struggle the faster you sink but if you do nothing you still sink. The only way out is to follow the 3rd way which is part of the lightworker code. Neither oppose nor accept the evil of this world but instead focus on what you DO want. Instead of opposing war people should be advocating peace. These are not the same thing. </p>

<p>This is how the Russians diffused the situation in 2013. Instead of just saying no, no, no we oppose airstrikes they offered a 3rd way out. Assad and Russia agreed to turn over chemical weapons and the UN approved the inspections. The choice isn&#39;t just YES war or NO war. There is always a 3rd option.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Same here, but it seems the military-industrial complex are far more power than I imagined. I have watched <a href="https://youtu.be/CWiIYW_fBfY">Dwight D. Eisenhower&#39;s farewell speech</a> numerous times yet everytime I watch it seems more true. </p>

<p>I&#39;m convinced no one leader can change this. The foundations of this government are soaked with blood and corruption to where the only way to fix this is to start anew. Weakening the federal government. They always taught us in school that the Articles of Confederation were much worse than the constitution and a strong federal government, but I&#39;m not so true that is true anymore. If states rights were more important than local elections would be more significant and the people could change the course of our own country. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you really thought trump was anti intervention, I dare to say you selectively heard what you wanted. He decidingly road the fence on the topic. At times placating the more libertarian stance, at others clearly speaking speakibg towards a more militaristic stance. Once he put mad dog as the sec of war, the questions about his willingness to act should have been answered. </p>

<p>But calm your tits on full blown intervention or regime change. In negotiations, it&#39;s not always good to take options off the table. Having the russians think we may act is in Trump&#39;s favor. He is not going to care about the peasents who think we might go to war being nervous. Until more happens, most are not going to be able to predict what is coming and that&#39;s a good thing. So, until more happens, to speculate is nothing more the an exercise in creativity. </p>

<p>I am 100% not doubting this, which is why I say we&#39;ve been doomed for ages. Every single president since JFK has not had the full freedom of implementing the changes they&#39;ve wanted to. I just think that making such a big ruckus about it now (was there as much outrage 5-10 years ago? I remember learning in school that we had to do something soon to save our future generations... but we never did) is also counter-productive to the even more threatening issues at our doorstep (it&#39;s pretty hard to believe on top of the worsening environment threatening every one of us and our future children, that there&#39;s even worse and more threatening things, but alas, there is).</p>

<p>This is all irrelevant from the initial point of Trump carrying through with his promises. Whether you disagree with it or not, the point was that he made a promise and carried through, so far he&#39;s having a MUCH better rate proportionally of carrying through on campaign promises than Obama ever did... </p>

<p>So it&#39;s pretty funny to see people go &quot;WOOOOOW you really thought Trump wouldn&#39;t lie? Really? <strong>You are the reason America is in shambles!</strong>&quot; Yes, ofc he was going to lie, all of them do... it&#39;s about how much he lies, how corrupt he seems, what the ulterior motives are behind the actions (foreign influences, etc) and compared to Obama (up until the Syrian airstrikes which he picked up from the expert Barack himself) he&#39;s looked good (now that he has made this stance though, fuck him... ironic to see Liberals start supporting his actions now haha)</p>

<p>Trust me, protesting in the street about Climate Change is not going to save our children. I hope in my lifetime to be able to do something that can actually contribute something somehow, but if you think political change is the answer, bahahahahahahahha</p>

<p>Like you just said to me right now in your comment:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>these politicians... as long as they die rich, they don&#39;t fucking care </p>

<p>You realise this is applicable to the last 100 years+ of politics and not just the Trump administration right? If anyone important enough was serious about climate change we wouldve done something years ago, the pressure on Trump is really no different than the pressure shouldve been on everyone before him. Oh well, keep complaining about the &#39;big issues in this world&#39; that have only apparently come about in the last 2-4 months and have never been around for say, 100-1000 years </p>

    <div class="md"><p>dude, the difference is that at least obama believed in the paris agreement and actually made progress towards a cleaner environment. the fact that the president of the us supports these kinds of things motivates other countries to do the same. trump simply destroyed that view for many americans, which is very dangerous. i mean, it&#39;s not true as of yet, but some people were jokingly saying that germany were now the leaders of the free world. also, the fact that trump is pretty much in bed with russia strengthens this view. as a non-american, i can tell you that trump truly is destroying the image of the usa. but then again, some people in america might see it very differently.</p>

<p>And he&#39;s getting BTFO by deep state, so he cut a deal.</p>

<p>He&#39;s known for wanting to strike deals. That was part of what got him elected. He&#39;s also known for fighting back over some of the stupidest things, such as over a innuendo regarding the size of his hands. This is also part of what got him elected.</p>

<p>He&#39;s a populist, and his position in negotiations is largely dependent on his public support. The media has successfully portrayed him as having virtually no public support, and so he has virtually no leverage in negotiations.</p>

<p>You&#39;re tripping. It isn&#39;t the left or the right. There are interventionists on both sides of the aisle. They were against Bush for reasons that have little to do with geo-politics.</p>

<p><em>liberals in America are becoming the new conservatives.</em></p>

<p>They are, but not solely in the form of interventionism.  There was a movement in the early 90s called <em>New Democrats</em>, where globalism was a focus, the educated upper classes sold out unionism and labor based politics, and quite honestly exactly what you implied happened. There&#39;s a pretty massive overlap between the economics policies of New Democrats and Globalist Republicans.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know man, I don&#39;t know. I felt so detached from the democratic party this election that I re-registered as a green party member before the vote.</p>

<p>I&#39;m primarily a pacifist and the left used to feel so peaceful. We wanted to end the war in Iraq, end the war in Afghanistan, bring the troops home. This was a promise made by Obama and why I supported him.</p>

<p>... it literally took one generation and suddenly we&#39;re all about intervention in the middle east? What in the living fuck happened? This shit scares me. How can minds can change so quick?</p>

<p>Was it the generation after ours? Was it that they grew up and started losing their pacifist beliefs? Is Hillary saying we need to intervene and passing around a picture of a hurt child all people need as evidence?</p>

<p>They made it <em>humanitarian</em> to want to go into the middle east. They made it about saving babies. They figured out how to get into our heads. I think this is the primary cause for the drastic change, and I think that they know they can keep the military industrial complex happy and the people happy with the right spin.</p>

<p>What scares me is that I think they perfected their methods of control over public opinion. I think they amalgamated all their data sources, twitter, facebook, reddit, and used statistics to figure out how to sway public opinion and see how to spin something and visually get an idea if that method worked. I think simply by having a platform to do analysis like that, that&#39;s all they need for total control over the public.</p>

<p>It&#39;s the ultimate propaganda analysis machine. You drop a sound bite, you watch the meter go up or down. I think that&#39;s what it boils down to these days. The internet has freed us and allowed us to make a difference as individuals, but it&#39;s also allowed us to be controlled as a group. We built our own Orwellian future without even knowing it. We built the platform that would be perfect to control us. We built it, and they tapped its potential.</p>

<p>Its built up too much momentum. We can&#39;t stop kids from getting in on this without taking away ALL of their smartphones. We made them subject to the propaganda from the start. Four year olds have smart phones these days. We plugged them in willingly. From the cradle to the grave, the social media addiction will persist. We are social creatures and this lets us always be connected to friends and family. Those with money realized they could buy the data, tap it, throw engineering resources at it, analyze it. They realized that with that information, it&#39;s enough to influence our thoughts. Benign reasons, but villainous applications.</p>

<p>The average person isn&#39;t dumb, but the average person is emotional and reacts. By knowing exact responses of the public&#39;s reaction, they can predict reactions we&#39;ll have to any sort of event. With that knowledge, all it takes is spin.</p>

<p>We need a revolution in <em>privacy, media consumption, and behavior</em> in order to combat what they&#39;ve done. This will need to be in part an education into methods that give us immunity to analysis at this scale. We need a revolution in <em>investigation</em>, open source and publicly funded investigation into the truth behind the pictures, the truth behind the politician&#39;s statements. We need investigators that can&#39;t be compromised if they exist, people willing to call out bullshit when they see it and make politicians accountable for the lies they spew and propaganda we see. We need <em>independent and unbiased</em> journalism that NEVER talks to politicians outside of an interview with a mic. We have watched the quality of our news go down a million fold. MSM plans events with politicians, spews bias, spews propaganda, no restraint. We need to enforce criminal laws for this sort of behavior. </p>

<p>Compromised media is their mouth, and social media is their eyes. We have to cut both out in order to change. </p>

<p>One or two days ago, there were a shit ton of posts (that I admittedly scrolled past because I am a selfish piece of shit and just want to feel good) about people protesting all over the place due to corrupt governments.</p>

<p>There is one post today about China sending 150k troops to the NK border.  Nothing more about Syria.  Nothing about protests.  No shit about Russian ties or whatever.  Reddit is flooded with posts about United Airlines.  Well.. maybe this is not entirely fair.  <em>My</em> Reddit is flooded with posts about UA.</p>

<p>Obviously Reddit isn&#39;t the only source for information, and I likely just subscribe to shitty subs, so this could be and maybe is a garbage observation.</p>

<p>I&#39;d expect that someone from the Middle East would be better informed about intra-arab politics and it&#39;s global implications than someone in the US...</p>

<p><em>rarely involves getting down to evidence and being critical about sources</em></p>

<p>Here&#39;s the thing, literally anyone with on the ground experience or formal training in this subject is immediately subjected to massive ignorance due to the nature of the audience here.

<p><em>They have a lot of presuppositions in their thinking, and are more-or-less willing to discuss these premises. For some, the ideas are so entrenched they are simply unwilling to have a conversation</em></p>

<p>I&#39;d be more than willing to provide the non-strawman arguments for American intervention, where I think the mistakes happened, where I think the Russians are doing well, and why I think that push comes to shove I&#39;d rather see Iranian hegemony than Saudi, but  I refuse to get looped into pointless argument where someone links the first twenty articles provided by google on why the US created IS.</p>

<p>And, from a strategic standpoint, it doesn&#39;t make sense, unless the intention is to turn America into an open police state.</p>

<p>Then again, it&#39;s not much longer that we can sustain this. Even without a collapse of the price of oil, there&#39;s going to be a collapse of the US dollar.</p>

<p>The conditions are not in place to repeat anything approaching the boom years experienced in the past, our debt is only growing and the budget isn&#39;t trajecting in a sustainable direction so much as it&#39;s tragic.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, our best and brightest seem determined to either continue strangling the globe into submission, or chasing after fantastical dreams of becoming the leaders in alternative energy, as if the Chinese won&#39;t steal all our designs either directly when we have them manufacture the components, or indirectly when they have the Russians hack our networks.</p>

Who the fuck tries or succeeds to get on a plane after being forcibly dragged off by goons wearing shirts that say POLICE. Also, this guy who was dragged off is so fucking famous, late-night hosts are doing elaborate sketches less than 24 hrs after, social and mainstream media carrying the story like it&#39;s 9/11 part deux, CEOs releasing statements and press conferences about this,  but no one knows the guy&#39;s fucking NAME.

He first agreed with being bumped and getting a cash voucher for bumping him with his wife until he learned the delay could be up to 24 then he refused to get off. The moment he refused to get off he broke the contract of carriage you enter when buying a ticket. He flat out refused to move even after airport security was called.

<p>So true in a sense(but the upper middle class and wealthy are also the same so it is not a &quot;peasant thing&quot;), and the sad thing is that is that people care about more about fictional characters and their fake suffering, than the real suffering in the world of the downtrodden. Indeed since they spend so much time with entertainment industry nonsense they will believe the capitalist propganda that the poor create their own misery, rather than realizing they are the victims of a social hierarchy where money makes money and conversely where poverty is more often than not passed down from generation to generation.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll agree the professional class or merchant class in feudal comparison may be even more indoctrinated than the skilled and unskilled classes. They consume large amounts of NY TIMES, Investment, and Business propaganda which is littered with agenda.</p>

<p>They bought into the system fully (higher education(master/phd), pharmaceutical drug dealers(doctors), system leeches such as divorce lawyers/lawyers and are awarded accordingly ($$$). </p>

<p>Enough wealth is dished out to the professional class to give the poor incentive and potential to attain such status, when it reality it rarely is, even with hard work. Money makes Money.</p>

<p>This leads to something called &quot;David Humes(economist) Demostrative Effect&quot;. </p>

<p>Where luxury purchased by the Professional Class is envied by the lower classes and is purchased by them, regardless if they can afford it or not. Usually on Credit, which leads to debt-servitude and more profit for the oligarchical class.</p>

<p>How would you differentiate a peasant class from intergenerational poverty in the US?  <a href="http://www.washington.edu/omad/files/2013/03/Overcoming-Generational-Poverty-Article.pdf">http://www.washington.edu/omad/files/2013/03/Overcoming-Generational-Poverty-Article.pdf</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>By that social status being imposed by a shadowy oligarchy working together to keep you down so they&#39;ll have a labor force. That doesn&#39;t exist. In fact those taxes that us &quot;peasants&quot; pay go towards funding for public schools so that people like the author above are less likely to drop out of school due to poverty and hopefully have a chance of making it out. If we really had a permanent peasant class we either wouldn&#39;t have public schools or this shadowy oligarchy would sabotage them so that they&#39;d be so terrible anyone trying to advance in their education wouldn&#39;t stand a chance. Neither one of those is the case</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I didn&#39;t say it did, but this conversation was about whether a permanent peasant class exists or not. If a permanent peasant class is one not just stuck in poverty but hopelessly stuck in poverty because of a cynical oligarchy oppressing them then that article isn&#39;t really talking about the same thing. So in a way my point was that you&#39;re right, the article isn&#39;t talking about generational poverty in the same way that the rest of this thread is.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Well yeah... The wealthy that don&#39;t have to work aren&#39;t the 1% though. They make up maybe 1% of the 1%. And part of the reason they don&#39;t have to work is because they haven&#39;t built up that wealth in the form of money but in assets like land, companies etc. They&#39;ve made their money work for them which is just good money management. Either way producing (or working), paying taxes, and consuming is everybody&#39;s place in the world if you want to be utilitarian about it. That&#39;s why we all try to find meaning in life in other ways so it shouldn&#39;t be surprising that they see us as potential consumers. Everyone is a potential consumer including the 1% you&#39;re talking about.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Assad is allegedly responsible for the chemical weapons attack. I&#39;m in the camp that believes the attack was a false flag. Why would Assad use chemical weapons now when there were peace talks taking place? </p>

<p>The US is amassing warships and troops in the middle eastern gulf region. China and the US are amassing troops around North Korea. Russia and Iran have vowed to attack on American troops if there is any further escalation against Assad.</p>

<p>My take is that Trump ordered the missle strike as a retaliation and nothing more, but McMaster is pulling the strings and is trying to coerce the US into taking out Assad and ISIS where Trump only wanted to take out ISIS. If we try to take out Assad, the Russians won&#39;t take that lying down and we will have a full blown war on our hands.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think they are two different issues that have different implications.</p>

<p>The Syrian issue is harder for the American public to think critically on because of how cable news portrays it. Also I think people also feel removed from the issue and those in power are going to do what they want to do. I&#39;m not sure if that is the case, just a thought.</p>

<p>With the United Airlines issue, I think it is easier for people to relate to that. Majority of Americans have been on a plane, and it is easy to sympathize sympathize with the injustice against someone who is just like us.</p>

<p>I guess for me, they are both important issues, Syria is important because of geopolitical tensions, United Airlines is important because how they responded to it paints a bleak picture of corporate power in America.</p>

<p>If someone wants to explain that logic, I&#39;m all ears.</p>

<p>Or, is Shareblue just the go-to boogeyman, even when we&#39;re talking about Trump&#39;s actions?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>People are ignoring anything to do with NK because it&#39;s NK and it will always end in them crying and doing nothing, maybe shooting another missile into the ocean and grandstanding about it. Eventually the truth about how fucked their country is will reach the people living in it and they&#39;ll starve to death frowning in disbelief or they&#39;ll rise up and hang Un and put someone in charge who isn&#39;t a psychopath with a god complex.</p>

<p>WW3 is never going to happen. No one country is going to attempt to take over the world anymore by force. It can&#39;t be done. Logically, almost physically, it cannot be done. WW3 will not be fought by nukes it will be fought in our hearts and minds. No one is worrying about a nuclear apocalypse because it is never going to happen, not now, not ever, everyone loses in a nuclear war. Everyone. Us, them, the Illuminati, the Jihadi&#39;s whose holy lands are reduced to radioactive rubble, everyone loses. The mad scientist or crazy super villian that wants to end all life on the planet, and is capable, does not exist outside of film.</p>

<p>People aren&#39;t worried about WW3 or Earth-nuking because <em>it is not going to happen ever, ever, ever,</em> it&#39;s the stupidest and most short-sighted idea of a strike and would be thrown out of any high-level conspiracy meeting between the elite. I can&#39;t stress that enough. Just put yourself in the shoes of some high-authority elite mug, why in Satan&#39;s demonic nutsack would you blow up the fucking planet you&#39;re living on, that you&#39;ve worked centuries to control and develop? It&#39;s not about nukes, it&#39;s about image.</p>

<p>Why blow half the world up to control what&#39;s left when you can simply mesmerize them with dancing lights and sounds and use them to build and consolidate your power? Even better, they <em>want</em> it. Lots of people just want to be left alone, to live their simple lives amongst the consumerism rush from one movie to the next game to the next scandal and cycle repeat.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Of those that even follow politics, Americans will always root for their team in times of conflict.</p>

<p>Right now a liberal would support anything against Putin because they believe BS about Russian Interference and they are all mad about his supposed human rights abuses. That he is bent on world domination (ironic)</p>

<p>A standard conservative would believe similarly less or more hawkish as interference is not as big an issue nor are gay rights. Trump supporters would be skeptical he is being controlled by &quot;globalists&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>North Korea had it coming.</p>

<p>Trump should have spilled the beans on ISIS &amp; the CIA , and focus most of his foreign policy of his term on Working with China to eliminate the North Korean government. </p>

<p>If the North Korean government was overthrown &amp; the world were to see the living conditions there, and if Trump didn&#39;t bomb Syria then we might have seen Trump&#39;s ratings jump quite high, like what happened to Bush after 9/11.</p>

<p>If Kim is cocky enough to kill his brother with VX in a foreign  public airport then he has to go, VX is so dangerous that Kim could have killed hundreds in the airport by accident. Kim&#39;s brother was the ACE card of the Chinese.</p>

<p>I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if what&#39;s happening to North Korea is a deal that China struck with Trump, the deal would allow trump  to smack North Korea around. China would let Trump do that to put Kim in his place. The troop deployment is probably Refugee control.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been thinking about this too and it comes down to one simple thing. People can relate to how this guy was treated. There was really no barrier between what we saw on someone&#39;s personal Twitter video and the public. The Syrian conflict has many layers to the onion that get convoluted by what news network you&#39;re watching and their agenda. It also does not affect everyone&#39;s daily lives like flying an airplane can. People think, &quot;what if that was me?&quot; People see war in a third world and think, &quot;the problem is on the other side of the world, why should I care?&quot;</p>

<p>People that care about what&#39;s happening in geopolitical warfare like OP and everyone else here actually care because we see beyond the headlines and the bigger picture. </p>

<p>Are you sure that&#39;s not some MSM narrative control? In particular, SJW progressive MSM narrative control.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>The American people have been shilled with fear-mongering of WW3 since August 1945.</p>

<p>At this point, no one&#39;s using nukes, at least not until enough nations have nukes that nukes could reliably be used in a false flag.</p>

<p>That&#39;s as good a reason as any to prevent other nations from developing nukes.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Could all this reaction against United be a distraction because of Shareblue or something?</p>

<p>Fixed that for you. This is exactly what the leaders want. They want you to not think about real world stuff and just work, work, work. This is a big part of the problem with the US. We work so much, when we finally get free time, we just want to relax, not worry about the country.</p>
