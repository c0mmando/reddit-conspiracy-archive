       Yes, I like what this lady is saying. But we have been hoodwinked before.
      </p>
      <p>
       She is extremely calm, well mannered, and talented and presentable on camera. TPTB could be GROOMING her as the new female "Obama" they are prepping for 2020, as a breath of fresh air from trump. She is saying things I like, but the body language, her CFR membership, her sudden and random thrust into the limelight, the fact that she is a palatable female democrat progressive; it all points to her being prepped for a 2020 run, and I keep hearing people call for it, so it's probably going to happen.
      </p>
      <p>
       Wasn't there a redditor here who knows tulsi personally? Several have pointed to her membership in the CFR. If you're in the CFR, you're a puppet. It's that simple. They don't let people like Ron Paul or Rand Paul in, and they wouldn't WANT them anyway! And don't give me that "well, she's the best we got!", that's how the plebs talk about politicians, cherry picking the good things and ignoring the bad things with their mental gymnastics, just like all the autistic trump supporters have done/are doing...
      </p>
      <p>
       Be skeptical people...this is a conspiracy sub. Fucks sake...lets nip this one in the bud for once before it takes flight. If she IS the next puppet, we could fuck up their whole agenda by exposing her early enough.

       She's had her own logo since running for office when she was 21. That's what they do... get logos for signs, etc. because in Hawaii, 'sign waving' is a thing unknown people use to get their name out.

       Well, what's more important than that is her anti establishment demeanor, which will come in handy in 2020 when trumps time is up.
      </p>

       Personally idk...I don't see there being a 2024 election. Infact, in not sure there will even be a 2020 election. But if there is, TPTB are grooming this woman as their little hand puppet...

       Why is she getting so much media support? /end thread. She is being "groomed". Mind you, I say fuck all to all. I would even say fuck you to Ron Paul. Know when to hold em, know when to fold em'... Politicians are not the answers. Fuck em' all...

       Man, me and a buddy were talking about her today. I told him something about her just don't sit right with me. She is highly attractive, she speaks well, she is speaking out against the Syrian war narrative. She isn't afraid to stir shit. She is intelligent. She is basically "perfect".
      </p>
      <p>
       That bugs me. They say he Anti-Christ will first appear to fix everything, and be loved by all. Not sayin she is the AC, just sayin...there is something fucky with her.
      </p>
      <p>
       At first I was on the Gabbard hype train, then I started researching. CFR ruined it for me. Just far too many nefarious ties she has for me to trust her at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       She's gonna run in 2020, I guarantee it.

       Once seen, tricks cannot be unseen. I don't give two shits if you're "liberal" or "conservative". Once you've seen, it's obvious. Sure, I play devil's advocate with Trump, But I'm not fooling myself. They are all pieces of shit. Something aint right with this chick.... The air time.... Yeah, I'd like to fuck here, but that's about it. Most supporters would want a "stable" relationship with her. She's an opportunist, and the epitome of a predator. You been around enough, you can see the traits.... It's pretty basic. Just goes to show how far the masses have gone.... Like I said... I'll be off to Poland or Russia...

       Very skeptical myself. I'm glad we all share this healthy skepticism. Anytime a politician is thrusted into the limelight, EVEN IF THEY SAY GOOD THINGS, their ass needs to be watched. It's that simple. We don't get 2nd chances folks, we have to put trust into people, and we can't be willy nilly about this..

       You can't research her by researching something like CFR. She's fully capable of speaking for herself. In your search, did you run across Dennis Kucinich, another peacemaker? They're in the minority and not being listened to, obviously, since they supposedly make policy for the president to 'march' to. They are adamantly against regime-change wars; neocons are pushing for more war and she's being attacked for pulling back the curtain on it.

       She's clearly not a puppet. The establishment hates her pretty heavily. CNN just ran a hit piece and the elites talk shit about her on twitter all the time. The only reason she was thrust into the spotlight was because she left the DNC over Hillary screwing Bernie. There's an email on Wikileaks of her being threatened over it. She's definitely not who we should be going after. These are the politicians we need more of, it genuinely looks like she's one of the good ones. Anti regime change and focus on laws that help people not corps

       We are at a time where the elite are AWARE of the populations disenfranchisement with the mainstream media. So, they use the MSM to attack their puppet candidates on purpose, as sort of a "reverse psychology" to trick people into thinking they are truly against the system. They have been saving this psychological tactic for years, and first implemented it with Donald Trump.

       They might do that now but these people have been attacking Tulsi since at least the Middle of the election when everybody thought Hillary was supposed to win. Syria is an important issue for DC and they don't want people getting in their way.

       you still think that's all it takes to make it "clear"? Honestly if you think things are immediately clear you should take a step back and think about just how many ways there are to deceive. I can't help but agree with some things she says but look at what a fraud Sanders turned out to be: went from talking about wall street oligarchs and the Mosaddegh coup to endorsing Clinton, the Cold War 2.0 narrative, and Syrian regime change

       Who said anything about primarying? I couldn't care less about what the Dems or GOP have to say about anything or anyone. All I said is proceed with caution and please slow down a bit and consider that you might be being deceived. Was the establishment not fanatically against Trump? How do you feel that is currently shaping up? Things are anything but "clear" in politics, possibly now more than ever.

       Dennis Kucinich is also on CFR. She's going against the DNC establishment neoliberals and neocons crying for more war for the MIC and their portfolios, and yet here we are...

       I personally think she is the politician the high level insider alluded too. He talked about how  they were going to choose someone to implement into the presidency and their rise to fame would appear to come out of nowhere. Also reading the high level insider's last question session, he said things have been going downhill faster than expected and that they will begin their interventiom immediately.

       My paranoid schizophrenic mind says they are going to install her if trump gets impeached, but my regular mind (just paranoid, without the schizophrenia 😂), says she will be groomed for a 2020 bid.

       They're trying to make an example out of her for what happens when you go against the DNC and the Clinton's, if anything. "They" hate Tulsi for endorsing Bernie Sanders over Clinton. Why are you so intent on helping them?

       Tulsi's for peace, as is Dennis Kucinich - another member. They are a minority in the CFR, obviously, because there is a march towards more regime-change war. Why would we go out of our way to promote war over peace by tearing her down? Something stinks here, and it's not the peacemakers.

       She's a puppet.  I made a comment critical of her support of Clinton yesterday and I got brigaded in the comments.  Strange that so many people put so much effort in to bury simple facts.
      </p>
      <p>
       Never forget folks, Gabbard supported Clinton on Aug 4 2016 while Bernie was still in the race.  Also they both worked together on the bullshit recount effort.  It looks now like there is a concerted effort to distance Gabbard from Clinton.

       LOL Clinton's been attacking her since she stepped down from the DNC to endorse Bernie over her. And is STiLL attacking her via surrogates like Dean and Neera and who knows who else...
      </p>
      <p>
       Tulsi did not 'support' Clinton. She said she 'like Bernie, given the choices between DJT and HRC, I will vote for HRC.' She endorsed Bernie Sanders, nominated him, and when asked said she was 'not prepared to endorse Clinton' - and she never did. Show me where she 'worked together' on the recount effort. You can't and I call BS.

       Still, she did support Clinton, as she demonstrated when she said on Aug 4 2016 that she would vote Clinton even though Bernie was still a contender.

       I'm pretty late, but I'm from Hawaii. I'm not a member of this sub but would like to put in a good word. She came to my grandpa's funeral back when she was city council (?). The funeral was on a neighbor so she had to fly in from Honolulu.
      </p>
      <p>
       My grandpa was a vet so she came representing some veteran organization. She didn't make a big deal out of her attendance, was very gracious, and completely down to earth. Obviously all politicians need to fake themselves a bit, but this was at a small family funeral with no cameras or media, so hardly any real incentive to her.

       Well, what's more important than that is her anti establishment demeanor, which will come in handy in 2020 when trumps time is up.

       Personally idk...I don't see there being a 2024 election. Infact, in not sure there will even be a 2020 election. But if there is, TPTB are grooming this woman as their little hand puppet...

       Man, me and a buddy were talking about her today. I told him something about her just don't sit right with me. She is highly attractive, she speaks well, she is speaking out against the Syrian war narrative. She isn't afraid to stir shit. She is intelligent. She is basically "perfect".
      </p>
      <p>
       That bugs me. They say he Anti-Christ will first appear to fix everything, and be loved by all. Not sayin she is the AC, just sayin...there is something fucky with her.

       At first I was on the Gabbard hype train, then I started researching. CFR ruined it for me. Just far too many nefarious ties she has for me to trust her at all.

       She's gonna run in 2020, I guarantee it.
