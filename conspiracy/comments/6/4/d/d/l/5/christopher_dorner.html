       The entire thing was super fishy. I'm thinking he was framed. I'm just amazed nothing came of it all these years later.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not sure I believe he wrote the manifesto. I'm assuming the LAPD (or at least the corrupt branch of it) did so. They would have had access to his facebook account due to him have been logged in on an office computer. When he was fired, I doubt he was given the chance to clear the password history on LAPD equipment.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, who would murder a person who thinks your right / innocent? Seriously. Why would you pick the only person who would be able to defend you and kill them? It's just counter intuitive and something you'd do if you wanted to setup someone for a crime.
      </p>
      <p>
       The cops that were murdered from long range could have been setup by anyone. Who knows, maybe those were actual clean cops trying to do their jobs and the LAPD decided to get rid of those goody two-shoes.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've FOIA'd the US Navy to find more information on who Dorner visited on the base on Feb 5th, but I'd assume it would have been a past CO or friend. I'm assuming he went to ask them what to do as he had been framed, and I'm pretty sure the CO/whoever told him to just run because there way no way to disprove the evidence. But hopefully, I'll find out the truth via govt requests.

       I agree something seemed off and the media, other than the manhunt itself and the supposed murders he committed, didn't report much else that I saw.  I always felt there was more to this story than we heard.  They were hell bent on killing him. Not saying he didn't do bad things per say, just they didn't want him to talk.
One of my Grandfathers, who served in ww2 and the Korean War, use to alway tell me to question any story that involved the word 'Manifesto'.

       Yeah... not to mention, why in hell would you post your plans for assassination publicly? It just makes me think the LAPD were holding anyone who could help him ransom.

       I agree. Plus, if I recall correctly, even the folks he took hostage said they didn't feel threatened by him and that he was very polite. None of the puzzle pieces fit properly. It's like the picture was forced together.

       I remember the day the manifesto went out. It was posted to a pastebin. I copied it and printed it out to read over lunch. I sat down and read it and it made a lot of sense. Dorner was backed into a corner and being framed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Later that afternoon I came back to Reddit and the news was covering him as this delusional killer. I went to the link to the pastebin and sure enough the entire thing had been changed. They used much of what he said but inserted crazy confessions and things that made him look crazy. The manifesto was edited by someone who wanted to make him appear crazy and dangerous. They wanted this guy dead. Within 48 hours they burned him to death and no one cared.

       In William Cooper's
       <em>
        Behold a Pale Horse
       </em>
       , he talks about how police have been compromised. Keep in mind this book was written in the early 90s. Specifically, there is a plan to militarize the police, to instigate civil unrest, to manufacture mass casualty events with guns, to create circumstances where the government can declare martial law and round up and imprison dissenters. I think Dorner's earlier manifesto alludes to this fact. Let's speculate that for such a conspiracy to exist there would have to be key people on the inside that are a part of it. While we'd like to think your average cop wouldn't be down for this kind of thing, consider now how that same cop might behave after several years of civil unrest and violence. That cop, conditioned with the image of invading Muslims, parachuting Russians, dangerous Mexicans, crazed anarchist Leftists, or gun toting Patriots, is now primed to be used to kick down someone's door and stomp in their face.

       Huuuuge fairness. They killed the poor guy. He's a real hero.
      </p>
      <p>
       I remember on another account, I was very in to it. Very many people read my posts with evidence that he was innocent and he was murdered. I used to know everything about that case. Some kind of secret police even followed me for weeks after (in Canada). I was very scared. I know the last part makes me sound like a paranoid psycho but I even have photos of them, which I showed my family etc. And they agreed I wasn't crazy lol.
