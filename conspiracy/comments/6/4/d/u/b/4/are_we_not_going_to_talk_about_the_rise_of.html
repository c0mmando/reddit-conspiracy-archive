But since the Muslim Brootherhood a terrorist organization coined term (ISLAMOPHOBIA) back a few years ago ,we as westerners are unable to ridicule the religion unless we are called bigots by everyone on the Left side of the politcial spectrum. But I say if I am a bigot for condemning a pedophilia religion WHICH Islam&#39;s founder was and taught his followers to do, then so be it I am a bigot then. And I have always been a liberal in many things and consider myself to be more in the middle of libertarian and Conservative. Yet can we please be logical and humane about this serious connection of Islam and human rights violations. 
NOTE&#39; I do not care about peaceful Muslims who live normal lives like the rest of us amd their feelings. I dont care of anyone offending anyone if its the truth and suppoorted with proofs. What I&#39;m talking about is the foundation of the religion and the rise of Islam in the west and how the western nations are now unable to ridicule the religion even though EVERYONE seems to realize it&#39;s bogus nature against the rights of women, homosexuals and even children. Yet if you go to their nations like Saudi Arabia you would be killed for even having this discussion. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes you can absolutly ban Sharia Law. For one it&#39;s in opposition. Towards rights of women. Second polygamy is outlawed and so is incest. Yet Sharia Law Islam teaches to (keep it in the family) as they have proven through research up to 70% of Pakistani muslims alone are offspring of incest relations. If you can outlaw a practice of sexual nature you can outlaw a practice of religious ones.. in ancient paganism you sacrificed children and animals.. That is outlawed as well for an example. </p>

<p>I live in Michigan.  You are wrong.  Arabs are a little over forty percent of the population, but many if not most of them are Lebanese Christians (Maronites).  Hamtramck is a Muslim majority city but they&#39;re from Yemen, Bangladesh and Bosnia by and large, and there are still plenty of hipsters and Poles there as well. </p>

<p>There&#39;s no sharia law enforcement in Dearborn or Hamtramck.  But I recommend Yemeni food! Very good.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well there&#39;s no denying that some practice polygamy but most societies have that.  No evidence of child harems, though.  And most Muslims assimilate after a generation or two. There are lots of gay Muslims around, plenty who shack up before marriage and leave the religion in the same way Catholics do.  </p>

<p>It&#39;s just not what the right or the left make it out to be. They don&#39;t need to be coddled or condemned. I&#39;m an atheist so I&#39;m not a fan of Islam but Muslims in America aren&#39;t looking to impose their beliefs on others. They fled their own home countries for a reason.</p>

<p>But definitely try Yemeni food if you get a chance. It&#39;s one of my favorites.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree that Islam did not create, nor contribute to the rise of pedophilia. However, it is playing a direct role in the normalization of pedophilia as western countries make exceptions to child marriage laws. Also, an influx of Islamic culture (which has kinder views on the practice) decreases the % of the population with a negative opinion. 
Also, the attempt at linking pedophilia to the LGBTQ+ community... which has zero to do with Islam, but is disgusting IMO. It can be seen as all parts of the same &quot;campaign&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How about just ignore the religious affiliation of the molesters? When I hear Satanic abuse its an automatic dismissal, because Satanic ritual abuse doesn&#39;t exist. Just say child abuse. When I hear Muslim child abuse I feel the same way. You people are so full of Muslim hatred that almost everything you spew about them comes from those fake news sites, that now gets an auto dismiss from me too. Maybe if you stopped with all the &quot;they raping everybody in Sweden&quot; shit I would listen. You guys are hardly the voice of reason here.<br/>
Saudi Arabian&#39;s are marrying like 8 year olds. I want to know why I am buying their gasoline at the pumps, and why they are an ally. I am all for sanctioning the fuck out of them until they bring up their age of consent. 
But when you start calling it a pedophile religion, Mohamed was a pedo etc I tune out. They are stone age religion and stone agers married children. It&#39;s not a pedo religion. None of the ones that immigrate here marry children. 
But yeah I will tune out the hate. I am not a boo hoo you offended me type of &quot;snowflake&quot; or whatever retarded insults you knuckle draggers are throwing out. Just not down with hating a whole religion. You should be able to be anti pedo and not even mention the offenders religion. Just like the white guys who fill up the county sex offender websites, you don&#39;t seem to care what their religion is.</p>

<p>There are no credible cases of Satanic ritual abuse. </p>

<p>There are certain cases of ritualistic abuse, although usually it is just child sexual abuse in a religious setting or with ritual elements.  There is certainly no evidence that there is a network of Satanists engaged in ritual sexual abuse, infanticide, etcetera.  <em>Those</em> were the claims made by proponents of SRA in the 1980s and early 1990s, until their scam was uncovered by more skeptical observers.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Bro. Thousands of rape cases are reported in Sweden. Whatever holiday they had recently it was hundreds in just one day.. Now for your so called defense towards Islam it must be because you know decent to good and we&#39;ll rounded muslims. So do i. However  this is not your job to defend them but to analyse the situation. Islam in its foundation promoted pedophilia. Islam&#39;s involvement in the west is more than ever before and it&#39;s threats towards anyone even you if you speak up agaisnt it is real. Like I said ALL FORMS of pedophilia like the Catholic Church in my example need to be brought to light. But to eliminate the possibility of the rise of pedophilia and Islam&#39;s rise in the west then all you are doing is scoffing at very real and 100% possible conclusions. If you find a police officer molesting a child does that mean all cops are pedophilies? Or when a pastor from a Methodist Church rapes a young child does that mean everyone in that church is a rapist? Wake up and realize we are not talking about individuals. We are talking about Islam. Which ABSOLUTLY promotes the cheating killing and raping of women and children in its foundation and it&#39;s source aka the Quran. Read about Muhammad and you would know that. </p>

Or what about if I was a college graduate on religious doctrines and have fully read the Qur&#39;an with fervent study for the last 8 years would that make me worth speaking on the subject all together? For i could be both for all you know yet you disagree with an obvious truth and think the truth is a lie making your understanding foolishness.

    <div class="md"><p>Have you studied the occult at all yourself? And how were they scamming people exactly? Sources? There are certain &quot;rites&quot; from much older times that some people may (do) believe in. Their sanity is up to debate don&#39;t get me wrong nor does it mean that whatever entity they believe loves hurting children exists. That doesn&#39;t mean the believers of it don&#39;t exist. People have believed fucked up shit all throughout time. </p>

<p>One of the best ones I hear is where are the bodies if organized cults exist? Bone burns at 3000F. While hot as all fuck it is a reachable temp and if someone has farm land what little is left of the bodies is easily disposed off. Also never trust a man with a pig farm. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay so it&#39;s obviously an emotionally based subject for you then. You said that it was hysteria and a scam and offered only opinion. Sorry if you were triggered because fundamentalist christians tried taking away your outlet as an angsty teen. But heavy metal has nothing to do with rites in conjuring demons at least on the outside. There are plenty of sources for human sacrifices done in the name of dark entities. You came in making the claim that, and i don&#39;t even want to call it satanic because they don&#39;t worship &quot;satan&quot; satan means opposer in hebrew. But theologic ritual abuse? Anyways you claim that its a sham and doesn&#39;t exist yet provided no evidence the burden lies on you buddy don&#39;t try and detract </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Mohammad Atta, the supposed hijacker and pilot of 9-11 (Never Forget) snorted cocaine and partied with hookers.  Religion seems to be a scapegoat.  What is going on is an attack on a culture and people, although, it&#39;s more of an attack on specific countries, such as Iraq and Syria.  The US won&#39;t attack &quot;Islamic&quot; Saudi Arabia or Qatar or Kuwait because they&#39;re it&#39;s allies. </p>

<p>The American&#39;s have been bombing the Middle East and destroying nations left and right like Iraq and Libya and Syria, causing millions of people to flee their homes so that&#39;s why you have these migrations to Europe and elsewhere.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There isn&#39;t any rise in pedophilia at all there is a rise in talking about it and reporting it. Adults having been fucking kids since the beginning of time it&#39;s only been recently that we&#39;ve decided that we should bring it out in the open and talking about it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree that Islam did not create, nor contribute to the rise of pedophilia. However, it is playing a direct role in the normalization of pedophilia as western countries make exceptions to child marriage laws. Also, an influx of Islamic culture (which has kinder views on the practice) decreases the % of the population with a negative opinion. 
Also, the attempt at linking pedophilia to the LGBTQ+ community... which has zero to do with Islam, but is disgusting IMO. It can be seen as all parts of the same &quot;campaign&quot;</p>
