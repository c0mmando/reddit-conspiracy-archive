<p>T_D has become an utter joke.  You can&#39;t even have a debate with anyone.  It&#39;s essentially a living breating non-mockery of /pyonyang where the glorious leader is celebrated much like T_D celebrates &quot;their God and emperor&quot;.

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been banned from T_D because I am a Sanders supporter, but I am hesitant to assume astroturfing in T_D based on narrative shift alone.</p>

<p>The evidence of political astroturfing from groups like CTR is
<a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/television/comments/5agmik/cnn_drops_commentator_after_finding_she_provided/d9gj9eb/">plenty</a> and <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/56qsfh/rpolitics_removes_top_link_with_7000_upvotes_and/d8m56vh/">varied.</a></p>

<p>I am much more accepting of circumstantial evidence about CTR(and its heir Shareblue) than I am about any other alleged astroturfing group because there is plenty of direct CTR/Shareblue evidence, such as them getting sloppy with their account juggling game.</p>

<p>So even though I am willing to attribute some activities to CTR/Shareblue because of a particular narrative and level of activity associated with it, I would not be so quick to judge The_Donald.</p>

<p>if things from t_D start appearing there</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This has been going on for a while. <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/60zyyu/resist_is_the_most_blatant_psyop_i_have_ever_seen/dfb7qys/?context=10000">17 days ago</a> I checked the first 3 pages of <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a> to see how many posts were from The_Donald after people in this sub were accusing <a href="/r/esist">/r/esist</a> of being manipulated.</p>

<p>There were 3 posts from The_D and 1 from <a href="/r/esist">/r/esist</a>.</p>

<p><em>Now</em> (as of the writing of this comment) there is 1 post from The_D and 1 from <a href="/r/esist">/r/esist</a>.</p>

<p>There are now <em>less</em> posts from T_D than there were a few weeks ago, which is very understandable given the situation.</p>

<p>T_D has <em>always</em> been manipulated. His sub has banned dissenters from day one. They&#39;ve manipulated their votes to reach the front of <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a> from day one. People have been calling out their bullshit from pretty much day one.</p>

<p>Literally, <strong>nothing has changed</strong>. But rather than accept being wrong, some people in this sub would rather fabricate an entire alternate reality in which a T_D (a sub <em>known</em> for vote manipulation, brigading, bots, etc) just now &quot;suddenly&quot; started doing this shit. It&#39;s like changing one&#39;s mind is seen as a sign of weakness to some people... It&#39;s really fascinating to witness the amount of mental contortionism exhibited.</p>

<p>Not true. I subscribed to t_d as a Sanders supporter who made it clear that I didn&#39;t support Trump and was on the fence about him. I was never banned, and in fact I wasn&#39;t even downvoted for having healthy skepticism about his candidacy. I actually liked the community a lot. I really wish I still had my post history from my deleted username, but it was a much better place than it is now.</p>

<p>In fact, I can&#39;t recognize it today, except to say that it reminds me of how Fight Club went from being this scrappy underground venue of interesting characters to a zombie-like militarized cult where people exert no critical thought, destroy opposing viewpoints, and defer to one leader. That entire sub is a sophomoric 4chan joke that turned into a living, breathing Frankenstein. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just because there were genuine people there at one point does not mean they weren&#39;t already manipulating.</p>

<p>Regardless, the facts remain: The_Donald was making their way to the front page of <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a> at least since a few weeks ago. Which I (among many, many others) have pointed out.</p>

<p>OP is claiming that <em>now</em> things are suddenly different. That it was the airstrikes that caused a &quot;180&quot;. That is straight up bullshit and anyone who browses <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a> knows this. </p>

<p>I suspect OP was simply too blinded by their own bias to see that sub for what it was. And now that their opinions have changed, they are faced the the option of either accepting that they were wrong, or fabricating an entire new reality in which T_D suddenly became astroturfed. OP chose the latter.</p>

<p>I think the OP was saying the subreddit did a 180 on the particular stance of the gas attack being a false flag... not that it did a 180 in terms of its manipulation.</p>

<p>My perception is that manipulation has been gradual. If it existed from the outset, it wasn&#39;t aggressive. They seem to be doubling down as of late, through, probably because more people are being skeptical of Trump (if not outright hostile and disgusted). Those who continue staying the course are looking foolish. T_D always prided themselves on being counter-culture. Whether or not this was true is another story. But the fastest way to lose the base is to have their views articulated on the main stream media and <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a>, I&#39;ll tell you that. </p>

<p>If the establishment wants to shit on the concept of 4D chess, they&#39;d do so brilliantly by parroting support for Trump on mainstream media outlets. It confuses the hell out of Trump supporters (and me, to be honest, though I didn&#39;t even vote for the guy). </p>

They haven&#39;t prided themselves in anything other than being Trump&#39;s human centipedes. Reddit literally changed their algorithm <a href="http://gizmodo.com/reddit-is-finally-fixing-its-trump-spam-problem-1792061056"><em>because</em></a> of the amount of manipulation going on in that sub.</p>

<p>OP is saying that T_D has been &quot;one big astroturf since the Syria strikes&quot;. I get that the &quot;180&quot; refered to the false flag accusations. But OP&#39;s claim that things have changed since the air strikes is bullshit.</p>

<p>The vote manipulating there has not been gradual at all. Neither has the banning. There&#39;s literally a sub, <a href="/r/BannedFromThe_Donald">/r/BannedFromThe_Donald</a>, dedicated to people banned from T_D. It was created 1 year ago. His actions are just so aggregious that the amount of people expressing concern is large enough to notice.</p>

<p>Regardless, this is about the bullshit claim that astroturfing just started in T_D or the claim that T_D was not reaching <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a> before the airstrikes.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve seen T_D reach <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a> consistently regardless of the contradictions (remember how they called themselves bastions of free speech, even as half the comments on the thread were deleted?). I&#39;ve seen posts with &quot;it would be a shame if we got this to the front page&quot; upvoted to the top simply to spam <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a> with their bullshit.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve shown you that even in the last 3 weeks, they were reaching <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a> consistently and people were calling them out for exactly what OP thinks just started after the airstrikes.</p>

My tax money and hard work shouldn&#39;t be spent on someone getting an East Asian studies degree, or liberal arts, or political science, or any other degree where you come out of school making as much money as you would have had you never gone. </p>

<p>Take your issues up with the government and find out how they are spending our money before you ask for more of mine.  They certainly have enough to create a utopia, but instead spend it just like the people who want more handouts from work. </p>

<p>It&#39;s a cycle of handouts and unaccountability... </p>

<p>Governments waste money, spend frivolously, don&#39;t help the average citizen, and ask for more from business owners. </p>

<p>Employees waste money, spend frivolously, don&#39;t help themselves, and ask for more from the business owners. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve owned a small business for 10 years, I have taken over 30 people from college and mostly not college educated people, gave them the tools /knowledge and helped them earn over 100-200k per year.  Of those 30, maybe 4 where financially responsible. They were also the best employees. The vast majority made that money, bought leases on luxury cars, unnecessarily upgraded their electronics every chance they got, and took lavish vacations. Those are also the same ones who I hear supporting free college, free healthcare, and maternity leave. </p>

<p>We have an entire generation that believes everyone should do more for them, and that they should be able to do whatever they want because they are &quot;special&quot; and everything is ALWAYS everyone else&#39;s fault. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You sound libertarian, to which I can agree on many points. I&#39;m a socialist, but I&#39;m pretty conservative. The &quot;free market&quot; is a sham however, a rich man&#39;s trick to get even richer. Just as these capitalists co-opted the terms socialism and libertarianism and explicitly removed any human element from them, they did the same for &quot;free market.&quot; It&#39;s all doublespeak. Rackets for days.</p>

<p>I want limited government, but I also want capitalism to finally die instead of dragging millions of people down with it regularly. It had its time and I think it was necessary in the transition from feudalism and slavery, but it simply cannot function. Many like to retort with &quot;that&#39;s just crony capitalism!&quot; but all capitalism is cronyism. It&#39;s systemic, built-in. It was created specifically to let the rich few get richer off the backs of everyone else.</p>

<p>I have no love for business, and I was a self-employed small business owner myself for years. It&#39;s staggering to me that people place more value in businesses than in people. Capitalism is fundamentally dehumanizing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because it&#39;s a scam by a small subset of capitalists and corporations want no competition at all. A free market would at least cause a sudden spike in competition, but it would all fade back into oligopoly.</p>

<p>Libertarians and anarcho-capitalists are misguided, but I believe they have good intentions. They just cling to the idea of an economic panacea.</p>

<p>All markets are regulated, so the concept is inherently oxymoronic. At the same time, like capitalism itself, free market economics played a progressive role.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s a fairly succinct criticism:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The free market is a system of inequality fundamentally because of one exchange which takes place within it, the exchange between worker and employer. On the face of it, this is a free and equal exchange. Selling your labour power is much like selling a sack of potatoes. The difference is that when you sell your labour power, the employer then controls the bulk of your life. He decides what you do with your skills, your energy, and a large part of your time.</p>

<p>He has the power to destroy your health, even sometimes to destroy your life. In Japan, they now have a new word for death from overwork, because it so common. That is not a particularly backward capitalist country. That is the most dynamic capitalist economy in the world today. The sale of labour power is not like just exchanging one good for another. It is a fundamentally unequal exchange, and the root of that inequality is that the means of production are in the hands of a small minority.</p>

<p>The free market is also a system of inequality because, built into it, is a varying, but always substantial level of unemployment — that is, a number of workers who cannot even become wage slaves. Unemployment means poverty for those who cannot sell their labour power and insecurity for those who can — for the moment.</p>

<p>It means that the idea of the free market being the best way of enabling individuals to plan their lives is nonsense. All your plans can be destroyed from one week to the next. If you lose your job, you can lose your home. You can lose everything. The inequality of the free market goes wider than that. The free market system also generates huge inequalities between countries and regions. In the free market system, investment goes where it is most profitable, and that is a place where there is already a good infrastructure of communications, a healthy, educated workforce, good relations with suppliers, ample markets and so on, i.e., a place which is relatively developed economically already. Thus, in the world today, and for the last 200 years, most investment has gone to the advanced capitalist countries and a few selected areas in the underdeveloped countries. We get huge inequalities at an international level.</p>

<p>The free market is not just an unequal system. It is an inhuman system. I do not think that anybody, given a choice, would say that the millionaires of western Europe and the USA having that little bit extra is more important than feeding the millions of people in the world who live constantly in danger of starvation. In the free market, money buys everything — and human need buys nothing. If you’re hungry, in a free market system, that is no entitlement at all to food. If on the other hand, you are quite well-fed and have lots of money, you can buy lots of food on a whim. Your whim is more important, in the free market system, than the desperate needs of the poor.</p>

<p>You can&#39;t claim that free market capitalism, which has created the greatest amount of wealth for the planet (socialism/communism have done the opposite, btw) is a conspiracy that allows the rich to get richer when the greedy corporate overlords don&#39;t support free markets.

    <div class="md"><p>This is why it helps to know about what you try to criticize before the attempt.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In political/economic theory, notably socialist, Marxist, and most anarchist philosophies, the distinction between private and personal property is extremely important. Which items of property constitute which is open to debate. In some philosophies, such as capitalism, private and personal property are considered to be exactly equivalent.</p>

<p>Personal property includes &quot;items intended for personal use&quot; (e.g., clothes, homes, and vehicles, and sometimes money). It must be gained in a socially fair manner, and the owner has a distributive right to exclude others.</p>

<p>Private property is a social relationship between the owner and persons deprived (not a relationship between person and thing), e.g., artifacts, factories, mines, dams, infrastructure, natural vegetation, mountains, deserts, seas, etc. Marxism holds that a process of class conflict and revolutionary struggle could result in victory for the proletariat and the establishment of a communist society in which private property and ownership is abolished over time and the means of production and subsistence belong to the community. (Private property and ownership, in this context, means ownership of the means of production, not personal possessions).</p>

<p>To many socialists, the term private property refers to capital or the means of production, while personal property refers to consumer and non-capital goods and services.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>they&#39;ve mistaken donnie&#39;s marketing aimed at the far left as actually representative of policy decisions.  trump did everything he could, short of actually being a decent principled person, to steal sander&#39;s message and worker focused non-interventionist position.</p>

<p>now that donnie has betrayed the non-interventionism that help draw down far leftist opposition to him and resonated with much of his conservative base his core base is revolting.  Their first targets are the same as ever, its what they&#39;ve been taught to associate all bad things with: liberals, which is also a handy way to hate on gays and minorities in public but with a political code word.</p>

<p>Hence the above poster&#39;s image.  He&#39;s mad at the donald, so has decided that the crisis is clearly that liberalism has corrupted the purity of t_d.  So a specter of the demon, a black person of uncertain sexuality, is drawn along with text which essentially displays anger at t_d for not proudly embracing and displaying an exclusively white-nationalist-christian-centric image for itself.</p>

<p>what i find ironic as a liberal lefty is that i also hate the posts in the donald that this img describes, but i hate it cause i fear for those that believe it and might think these republicans are different somehow and are actually not racist, sexist, or theocratic.  I see the posts this guy criticizes as deeply openly deceptive, a marketing campaign to find every token minority who wasn&#39;t politically woke enough to figure out how trump would effect their own lives and turn them into an impenetrable barrier against criticism.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

<p>look maybe they aren&#39;t all, every last one could be an exaggeration.  but only to some degree.  I know, as a white person, that a lot of the republicans claiming not to be racist will start telling racist &quot;jokes&quot; the second they see its only whites around.</p>

<p>And i pay attention to politics, so i know republicans do everything they can to fuck over every minority and everyone who is poor or disadvantaged in any way, while bending over backwards to help big business.  Especially big war.  That and the racism that seeps from the republican fringe, i see republicans not merely as racist, but as deeply openly dishonest in their claims of not being racist.</p>

<p>i don&#39;t think republicans and people who lean right politically claim to not be racist because they understand why it is shameful and wrong but only because they know it is considered shameful and wrong.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Do you think normal conservatives only debate liberals because they hate black people and minorities?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>no, but any serious analysis of the dimestore am radio opinions the average conservative regurgitates will find a deep and overriding concern for the how taxes are distributed and a coded &quot;concern&quot; that much of it is going to &quot;undeserving&quot; populations.  Basically republicans are led about by people who on the sly convince them that black people get too much government cheese, but if you elect them they&#39;ll stop the darkies from getting it and give it to the &quot;good moral <em>cough</em>white<em>cough</em> christians&quot;.  Or rather &quot;let them keep it&quot; since its all <em>stolen</em> from them anyway, according to the myth they sell.</p>

<p>so i disagree with your quoted statement, but only in that it suggests a cartoonishly monomaniacal picture of the conservative as only interested in their hate of minorities.  For the most part i&#39;d say they don&#39;t consider it a big part of their lives.  And its less an overriding hate, as an acceptance of an incorrect belief that individuals of such groups are more likely to be stupid, violent, criminal, a fear of such people, and infection by pseudoscience spread by racists to justify their belief in white superiority.</p>

<p>to get <em>hate</em> you have to gather like minded individuals of such a type together and rile them up at a target, thats how you get people marching to lynch effigies of obama for instance.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you use their race to devalue their opinions then yes it is racism.</p>

<p>If you assume that an entire political party is motivated soley on racism, then I will most likely believe that the assumptions are based on fear and biases.</p>

<p>If race is a social construct, does that put the power in the hands of those who attempt to shape the social order? What gives someone the moral right to designate what is racist, because I&#39;ve seen a whole lot of that this election. Is it suffering? Does that give us the right? </p>

<p>If someone is racist, question them and let them show how ridiculous they are and let others see them for the racists that they are. This is how we curve that behavior. Once people actually see what racist say they immediately click and realize that the behavior is wrong.</p>

<p>We don&#39;t have to go around being a sanctimonious gatekeepers, humans have had uncomfortable ideas since the dawn of time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been banned from TD twice!!! And just banned from world news for the exact same thing. First time was honestly my fault I didn&#39;t know what concern trolling was and once I knew I saw I was guilty of it but they understood my plea. The second was a question that totally got the witch hunt treatment. Didn&#39;t even have time to explain or break down my question further.

Well one good way would be to check posters history to see if they&#39;re constantly doing it, which they elect to ignore because they&#39;re lazy and would rather push the same narrative which is 100% suck Trumps dick or you will be perma banned.</p>

<p>That&#39;s not happening. I&#39;d say there is 0% chance that the military would allow it. Let&#39;s not forget, they committed treason under Obama when they refused to support ISIS, and instead leaked their positions to the Russians and Syrians so they could be bombed.</p>

<p>I doubt they would need 500 troops to take over Langley. The CIA has control because the regime lets them run wild. If the generals decide the regime isn&#39;t in control anymore, the CIA has almost no capacity to project force.</p>

<p>I wasn&#39;t talking about Trump. I was talking about the generals. And I can virtually guarantee, if an order was given to attack Syria, most of the rank-and-file soldiers would follow their generals if ordered to arrest everyone at the CIA and NSA instead.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I got perma banned there for this comment: &quot;I noticed we label things &quot;concern trolling&quot; when something goes against T_Ds narrative. Kinda sad. We should be royally concerned when most of us I assume have followed Trump strongly on his campaign trail and one of his major selling points was how we should not involve ourselves in others conflicts. Especially because this is one of the most obvious false flags in some time. I&#39;m all for trump obviously and have been, but blindly following someone is beyond idiotic, and its obvious from those that have supported trump and have spoken out about the missiles aren&#39;t blindly following as well. We should remain skeptical and keep open minds. Not arrogant, especially when the whole MSM is now praising Trump for his actions. That&#39;s incredibly scary... And its being ignored. I&#39;m just saying we should be prepared for anything on this sub.&quot;</p>

<p>On this post: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/64bnh3/i_am_here_for_trump_not_cernovich_or_pjw_or/">https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/64bnh3/i_am_here_for_trump_not_cernovich_or_pjw_or/</a></p>

<p>No reason for the ban. I have screen capped pictures but I&#39;m on my phone. I responded by saying they abuse their mod powers and other subs should know. This was their response and I kid you not&quot;
&quot;Please let other subs know what we&#39;re doing. Its great advertisement. It&#39;s not our fault you can&#39;t read the rules. Maybe you should do less drugs and more homework, sugartits?&quot;</p>

<p>They&#39;re complete scum there, and the mod clearly stalked me lmao. I&#39;m subbed to LSD.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is very true. I am a Trump supporter and have been with T_D since day one, but ive noticed lately that the second you go against the attack you are called a shill. Now one of the main reasons I supported Trump was because he said no foreign intervention. Now if he decides to go to war then in my mind that is a failure on him, not on my support. I find it funny that since the beginning of all this, members of the Alt-right have been called nazis and warmongers, yet they seem to be the only ones going against this attack.....That is also why we see 4chan slowly dissenting. </p>

<p>So sometimes there are a lot of us who disagree -- and the evidence of that was on the front page all day: We &quot;got caught up shilling&quot; and they&#39;re offering unbans to people who ask -- which is hilarious, because disagreeing with something isn&#39;t shilling.</p>

<p>Mods are stupid. Sometimes a lot of the people who are left after bans are stupid too.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is a cult of personality because it will support anything Trump says or does no matter what they were saying just a day before.

<p>Well, I&#39;ve been subject to some stalking from Monsanto shills that veered into politics during elections when they were attacking Jill Stein.</p>

<p>But a massive astroturfing campaign always leaves a trail of evidence. Even Monsanto shills would get sloppy and copy-paste talking points from Monsanto&#39;s website.</p>

<p>I am much more accepting of circumstantial evidence about CTR(and its heir Shareblue) than I am about any other alleged astroturfing group because there is plenty of direct CTR/Shareblue astroturfing evidence, such as them getting sloppy with their account juggling game.</p>

<p>So even though I am willing to attribute some activities to CTR/Shareblue simply because of a particular narrative or narrative shift and level of activity associated with it, I would not be so quick to judge The_Donald.</p>

<p>I think what might have happened is the mods there went full retard and began to post anti Muslim topics about killing Muslims and even pinned it. I think Reddit is trying to draw attention to it by allowing people to go there and see the hate. </p>

<p>Honestly its a bit weird because ad much as people claim the Donald is full of hate they never really ever posted things like this. I think they must be infiltrated. It was an incredibly bad move and a lot of posts from frequent visitors was against the topic and they kept deleting those negative even when they were positively upvoted. </p>

<p>You can say that that&#39;s what they do, but this was very different. Very unlike the sub and those who visit were against it. Something up</p>

<p>I thought Trump was hilarious. I still do. I didn&#39;t much care about all his position as much as I liked the system collapsing around him because he threw a wrench in it. Now... Now I question if this wasn&#39;t a plan from the start. Guess what. Those clowns at The Donald are in a deep deep state of cognitive dissonance.

<p>His speech announcing the bombing did not seem like the normal Trump. The speech was mpt matural, carried buzz words and seemed contrived. Unlike when Trump normally speaks, it sounds from the heart. This speech sounded very generic. </p>

I&#39;m not saying people should not have a right to have critical questions and opinions of the person they helped put into office, in fact, we all fucking deserve that. What I am saying is that Trump is a politician, and all high ranking politicians are against honesty and transparency towards the masses that voted for them, and are certainly against being real with those who did not vote for them. </p>

<p>My surprise is at the surprise of those being banned or witnessing it. It wasn&#39;t surprising when Trump supporters critized Hilary in clearly pro Hillary subs. This shouldn&#39;t shock anyone. </p>

<p>While it does impress me how micromanaged both T_D&#39;s astroturfing and its censorship by the Reddit powers are, this &quot;once corrupt always corrupt&quot; tribalist rhetoric is just as unhealthy here as it is with the fanatics who don&#39;t know how to question their own posts without getting banned.  And for that matter, it was just as unhealthy with the old brand of conservatives who labeled every conceivable outgroup a liberal or RINO.  Or the new brand of post-liberal fascists who label everyone but themselves oppressors.</p>

<p>Judge the situation, fight the artificial bias any way you can.  Do it at your home, do it in the places you care about, and do it at the front lines of bullshit if you&#39;re feeling feisty and have some debate skills.  T_D is not an exception to that rule--it&#39;s just a different kind of battlefield.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You gotta look at it through a different perspective, not the super cynical paranoid conspiracy theories view we all have. Everyone thought Trump was actually someone who was going to stand up to the powers that be cause he wasn&#39;t in their pocket. If Trump turns out to be another puppet then the people almost have no hope left. If Trump can&#39;t beat the Deep State then the Deep State can&#39;t be defeated and that&#39;s a pretty depressing thing to have to come to terms with. So it&#39;s perfectly understandable that people don&#39;t want to have to face that prospect just yet. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I didn&#39;t vote for the SOB.  But when he won, I had a sliver of hope that okay, maybe the plans of the elites are not inevitable after all, and that the crazy SOB might be the one to destroy them.  So I subscribed to the_dumpsterfire because it offered a counter to the doom and gloom I saw on the rest of reddit.  Plus I also got banned from a sub just for one post on the_dumpsterfire, and joined the_dogpoop because I was pissed I was autobanned merely by association.  F*** censorship of any form, and f*** guilt by association.  </p>

<p>I only had a temporary ban, but I don&#39;t think I can go back to the_deepstate like I used to.  I can&#39;t imagine how true Trump supporters must feel, like those that have supported him since 2015.</p>

<p>Either reddit admins are supporting zionism or mods have had this power without telling folks for way too long. I kind of tend to think mods have been able to hide comments with only the poster being able to see them while logged in but not off. </p>

<p>But it was on a post that was clearly bot voted. It had 4000 upvotes So high visibility. You can look at my profile to see the comment. I cannot rule out an admin seeing it as it probably made it to r/all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Astroturf killed IMDB and is choking off Reddit.  Its much worse than spam but no one seems to really want to do anything about it.  Is there really no tech solution to combat this?  Maybe weighted allocation of points to older accounts based on years to offset the hit and run new accounts and bots?  I remember Digg had something like this algorithm based on up votes but it crashed and burned when power users started abusing it but IMO what happened there is nothing compared to how compromised reddit has become with the astroturfing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been banned from T_D because I am a Sanders supporter, but I am hesitant to assume astroturfing in T_D based on narrative shift alone.</p>

<p>The evidence of political astroturfing from groups like CTR is
<a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/television/comments/5agmik/cnn_drops_commentator_after_finding_she_provided/d9gj9eb/">plenty</a> and <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/56qsfh/rpolitics_removes_top_link_with_7000_upvotes_and/d8m56vh/">varied.</a></p>

<p>I am much more accepting of circumstantial evidence about CTR(and its heir Shareblue) than I am about any other alleged astroturfing group because there is plenty of direct CTR/Shareblue evidence, such as them getting sloppy with their account juggling game.</p>

<p>So even though I am willing to attribute some activities to CTR/Shareblue because of a particular narrative and level of activity associated with it, I would not be so quick to judge The_Donald.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is why it helps to know about what you try to criticize before the attempt.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In political/economic theory, notably socialist, Marxist, and most anarchist philosophies, the distinction between private and personal property is extremely important. Which items of property constitute which is open to debate. In some philosophies, such as capitalism, private and personal property are considered to be exactly equivalent.</p>

<p>Personal property includes &quot;items intended for personal use&quot; (e.g., clothes, homes, and vehicles, and sometimes money). It must be gained in a socially fair manner, and the owner has a distributive right to exclude others.</p>

<p>Private property is a social relationship between the owner and persons deprived (not a relationship between person and thing), e.g., artifacts, factories, mines, dams, infrastructure, natural vegetation, mountains, deserts, seas, etc. Marxism holds that a process of class conflict and revolutionary struggle could result in victory for the proletariat and the establishment of a communist society in which private property and ownership is abolished over time and the means of production and subsistence belong to the community. (Private property and ownership, in this context, means ownership of the means of production, not personal possessions).</p>

<p>To many socialists, the term private property refers to capital or the means of production, while personal property refers to consumer and non-capital goods and services.</p>
