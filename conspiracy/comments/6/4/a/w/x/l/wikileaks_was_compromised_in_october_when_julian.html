       I agree.  He also did 2 interviews with Hannity?  Of all the reporters on the face of the planet, Hannity???

      <p>
       He's also never seen on the balcony or in the windows.  This used to be a common occurrence.  There was also a very long period when he wouldn't show himself at all.  And am I the only one who remembers that the whole east coast and most major cities were having internet outages about the time his dead man's switch was going to go off?

       One can argue that there are sharpshooters watching and waiting to kill him at any moment from a window, but they didn't do it before, so why would they do it now?  I don't agree that a momentary look out of the window would be that dangerous for him, and as I said before, he used to do it all the time, so why hasn't he since October?

       It's not concern trolling.  There is software that can now mimic anyone.
       <strong>
        It's wanting to know the truth of what's become of the man.
       </strong>
       I think he's dead, personally.  Another Clinton enemy dealt with by the elite.  I'd love to be wrong though, and all it would take is a live press conference or a short random visit to the balcony.

       Assange already is a brave man, and if someone shot and killed him now in public view, it would spark massive outrage and protesting.  the elite know this, and so should you.  You're being duped.

       You still failed to answer the question, now for the is it the 3rd time?  How about you go hide in a closet.  It's tough to admit our country does really evil shit, but it does.  It is a tough pill to swallow though.  If it frightens you so much, go on believing your fantasy that he's alive and well.  There are videos proving his image has been manipulated on this very thread, but don't look at them, it's scary.  Might cause some of that cognitive dissonance that is so uncomfortable for some.

       Keep in mind how easy it could be to fuck with the video just to spook some conspiracy theories. If Assange has been out of commission since Oct, I would expect similiar artifacts in the Hannity interview, but haven't.

       Don't forget, now they are releasing old hacking tools that are decades old technology and any modern netsec person does on a regular basis.
      </p>
      <p>
       I suppose it isn't really wikileaks who are releasing the hacking tools and Robbin Young conversation, but honestly, wikileaks is fucked.  This is what they are doing?  They should spend some time spreading information from r/netsec.  It might be more relevant to what the NSA can do.
      </p>
      <p>
       Are they struggling to stay relevant?  Are they compromised?  Do they not have great content?  Do they think this is good content, but don't have tech expertise to criticize it?
      </p>

       The whole thing is confusing.  Their recent tweets make me skeptical of them.  I hold my breath about them.

       If julian was ever not a psyop he is long gone now.
      </p>
      <p>
       What urkes me most is that hackers all over the world place themselves in a position of vulnerability to assist the wikilealks service. 
Only to have the bulk of their efforts 'stock piled' in some public boasted 'insurance file'. Which is disgusting and serves contrary to the intent of the true individuals whom released the content.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can't even report that assanges pgp key has been utilized since the election. The entirety of assanges efforts and mo changed mid election, mid hrc investigation. (on the very day his internet was reportedly cut and the original insurance files began to be rehosted from an additional location)-
      </p>
      <p>
       Let alone guccifer 1.0 stated he found false flag attack plans hosted in hrc's public server. Which assange would certainly have possession of had that statement been found true. Leaving the factual insurance files and arrest of hrc a top priority for all people of the planet.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yet lets believe fox news a media entity with a billion dollar studio budget that the very post election interviews serve us justice. As every release is notjing more then a pr update for how abuses are occuring on all people of our nation leaving no parties accountable for the crimes in which were committed. Have fun paying your parking tickets. Fixing your brake lights and coughing up money for every fucking thing and mistake you do wrong. While thousands of people are getting away from their actions which create suffering upon millions and millions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is assange dead. What does it matter when he is just another gate keeper; there by hiding the exact information in which others suffered for in providing him...
      </p>
      <p>
       Thats the real crime...
Who cares if he is alive if he is no better then the original entities concealing these crimes against the people of our nation and abroad. 
Criminally ommitting evidence of crimes, makes you an accessory.

       I understand your comments about being a gatekeeper, but one nitpick...do not forget that its core, Wikileaks is a journalistic enterprise. They do absolutely minimal curation (mostly just indexing, etc) but it is a lot of work in order to keep their good name. If they post even one fake thing it is over for them, and remember how when the soros leaks came out nobody cared because it wasn't indexed very well.

       By releasing all files they have indemnity of the fraudulent cases after investigations are conducted. 
There is sheer differences from documenting and gatekeeping.
This does not segregate the topic of omissions being ventured into any equation of the service in which they provide. Thus its easy to see it is a controlled asset of an existing hierarchy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyone can stamp and vet a document allowing the public to decide the relevance. It is the failing to release the material which shows there is objectives and culpability in the wikileaks organization. 
Ergo its preposterous-
