<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5ubmht/synchronized_mass_meditationprayer_for_arrests_of/">https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5ubmht/synchronized_mass_meditationprayer_for_arrests_of/</a></p>

<p>There is a new mass meditation taking place on the next full moon which is April 11th.</p>

<p>144,000 people would allow us to hit critical mass and drastically alter the world in a positive way. </p>

<p>We will be doing this meditation at the exact moment of the Full Moon on Tuesday, April 11th at 08:08 am Central European Time (CEST). This equals 2:08 pm CST in Taipei, 8:08 am EET in Cairo, 8:08 am EET in Palmyra, 7:08 am BST in London, 2:08 am EDT in New York, 1:08 am CDT in Chicago, 0:08 am MDT in Denver and 11:08 pm PDT in Los Angeles on Monday, April 10th.</p>

<p>You may be skeptical of group meditation and that&#39;s okay. Science has confirmed even individual meditation is healthy and helps relieve stress and anxieties, feel free to join us and meditate for yourself if this collective meditation isn&#39;t something that interests you.</p>

<p>We all have the power to change this world, and it all starts with you. Changing yourself changes the world. We are all one in source consciousness and we are all linked, all connected. Let&#39;s use our power of connectivity and oneness to spur greater positivity and abundance in this world for us all and renewed changes that benefit us all not just a select few.</p>

<p>This is the Golden Age of Consciousness and it&#39;s time we remember who we are and it&#39;s time we come together as one.</p>

<p>We hope you join us!</p>

<p>Light and love to you all ðŸ’œðŸ‘½</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The world around us is physical but our spiritual and energetic bodies work with the reality around us because of the creators we all are. Your immediate reality is a clue to your inside world happening within you.</p>

<p>Many people think we can&#39;t change the world by thinking positive thoughts because they think action or movement is the only way to change things. This is not true.</p>

<p>We all have the power to change our collective reality within our homes and personal comfort.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s take this opportunity to do just that. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know you will receive some flak for posting this, but there is something real about what you claim. It seems like there is a universal consciousness that people can tune into. The more people who participate, the better chances of success. I have actually witnessed this happen at a church once. I am not a Christian, but I have to admit I saw the whole church pray and right before my eyes their prayer was answered. I was flabbergasted.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Making fun of the idea of collective focus is the result of conditioned thinking. Protecting the ego construct through sarcasm and cyncisism is a learned strategy to avoid one&#39;s innate power. </p>

<p>If you think about it, the only way anything has ever been achieved is through collective focus. Maybe not always sitting quietly with intent, but all innovations, systems, organizations, egregores, and conceptual frameworks have come about through collective focus--i.e. a bunch of people coming together and lending their energy, intelligence and intent to making something come to fruition, whether this is a new widget, a geopolitical position, or a consensus reality.</p>

<p>It seems prudent to use one&#39;s discernment to actively choose where to focus attention, rather than focusing by default on things like learned hopelessness, helplessness, and despair. Imho there is nothing to lose and only potential benefit by taking some time out together to affirm, confirm, and support the reality that we are a heart family with benefit for all as the platform for our human operating system. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>â€œAnd when you pray, you must not be like the hypocrites; for they love to stand and pray in the synagogues and at the street corners, that they may be seen by men. Truly, I say to you, they have their reward. But when you pray, go into your room and shut the door and pray to your Father who is in secret; and your Father who sees in secret will reward you.</p>

<p>â€œAnd in praying do not heap up empty phrases as the Gentiles do; for they think that they will be heard for their many words.  Do not be like them, for your Father knows what you need before you ask him. Pray then like this:</p>

<p>Our Father who art in heaven,
Hallowed be thy name.
Thy kingdom come,
Thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.
Give us this day our daily bread;
And forgive us our debts,
As we also have forgiven our debtors;
And lead us not into temptation,
But deliver us from evil.</p>

<p>For if you forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father also will forgive you; but if you do not forgive men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses.</p>

<p>Remember, Love must be sincere. Hate what is evil; cling to what is good.  Be devoted to one another in love. Honor one another above yourselves.  Never be lacking in zeal, but keep your spiritual fervor, serving the Lord.  Be joyful in hope, patient in affliction, faithful in prayer.</p>

<p>For the prayer of a righteous person is powerful and effective. Elijah was a human being, even as we are. He prayed earnestly that it would not rain, and it did not rain on the land for three and a half years. Again he prayed, and the heavens gave rain, and the earth produced its crops.</p>

<p>My brothers and sisters, if one of you should wander from the truth and someone should bring that person back, remember this: Whoever turns a sinner from the error of their way will save them from death and cover over a multitude of sins.</p>
