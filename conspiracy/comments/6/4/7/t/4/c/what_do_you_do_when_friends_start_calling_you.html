       I basically lost one of my last IRL friends this week over a picture of chemtrails. He knows I'm into "conspiracy theories", and never responded to my theories much in the past except to give a light chuckle and change the subject.
      </p>
      <p>
       Earlier this week I sat outside and watched the jets fly over my area, dumping their silver clouds in a grid-like formation which then turned into a cloudy haze. I sent my friend 3 pictures of this unfolding and just mentioned that they were spraying hard that day.
      </p>
      <p>
       He proceeds to blow up my phone with a string of angry texts telling me I'm wasting my time, that I'm ludicrous and nothing I say is feasible, that I'm interrupting his work, and then tells me to share my "ghost stories" with someone else. I mentioned that there was documentation to show that climate engineering projects do exist and he again responded with "I just don't fucking care dude."
      </p>
      <p>
       This really bothered me because we've never even had a real argument before. He's also a typical, lazy American that spends his free time on Facebook while chain smoking cigarettes and getting wrapped up in his entry level desk job. He literally has no other hobbies or interests beyond very normal things and gets angry whenever anyone talks about religion, the supernatural or politics.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you let people like this go? I'm certain I can't wake this guy up and I don't feel like pretending to be normal around him all the time (talking about "normal" guy subjects such as cars, guns, hiking trips, women, business ideas, etc. all of which I'm losing interest in) and pretending that his menial and mainstream life is interesting to me at all. He's also killing himself through his awful diet, cigarettes and sedentary lifestyle and that's tough to watch without saying something.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd like to hear other stories from r/conspiracy. How has your personal journey toward truth affected your relationships with others, and how do you deal with backlash and disrespect of your search?

       Exactly. When I suggest to some common cow with sugar clogging their brain that reality isn't exactly as their bliss addicted little matrix-box says it is, they always get upset like a baby. They immediately start calling you names and attacking you, and that's how you know they're scared. They're afraid you might be right and their overall comfort level might go down if their worldview expands. It's pathetic if nothing else.

       Your real friends are important. Friendship goes both ways, and you have to respect their views and beliefs. It is a hard world and for some it is easier to submit to what is commonly believed.
      </p>
      <p>
       You must have had common interests and things you enjoy to do together, so stick to that. Relax, and enjoy the company of those you love. The search for truth can be put aside for a moment.

       I do not understand the violent and angry reactions people have to what they consider conspiracy theory nut jobs. I don't care if people post their pets or their MLM scam of the week. The media has taken it up several notches in the last year painting conspiracy theorists as dangerous fruit loops your buddy is internalizing all of the propaganda and brain washing the media has advocating. I wouldn't worry about this dude. He seems pretty lame anyway.

       My nephew is a police officer. He's 10 years younger than me. Last year when I told him that I'll always be grateful for Edward Snowden he absolutely lost his shit. To the point that we got into a yelling argument and didn't speak for some time. It ended with me telling him that the only difference between us was that he was beholden to law enforcement delusion and I was not.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fast forward to wiki leaks vault 7 release. I received a text apologizing and saying that he was man enough to admit he was wrong. Lol youngsters and pride cracks me up.
      </p>
      <p>
       I spoke with him the other night Trump sent missiles.
      </p>
      <p>
       He told me that prior to the wikileaks release he thought I was crazy. A tin foil hat crazy person.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regardless of what people think of Julian Assange and Edward Snowden I'll always be grateful.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'll never trust our govt and their agenda.
      </p>

       The truth, while is tough to take is far better than living in a delusional world.

       When a persons belief system is challenged with things they don't want to hear they get angry as a means of defense due to cognitive dissonance (not being able to hold two conflicting viewpoints at the same time). People choose to not face these things out of fear of it changing everything they believe. The famous quote from FDR "The only thing we have to fear is fear itself" makes a whole lot of sense in this context.

       Sorry that's happening to you.

       You did your best trying to talk to him about it openly. I had a similar experience with a friend. He actually was so offended by a "conspiracy theory" I spouted that he actually took to social media to mock me. Felt so awesome.
      </p>
      <p>
       I simply don't talk to him about that stuff anymore. If he wants to be in the dark, it's his problem. I want the people I care about to be informed but what can you do...
      </p>
      <p>
       I just say things really subtly now, and without buzzwords that people have been trained to have kneejerk angry reactions to.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you get no enjoyment out of his friendship there's no point in keeping it. That's a personal decision though. I wouldn't say cut it off over something like this, but if there's nothing else there? Then yeah definitely.

       All my relationships are good tbh. I don't shy away from conspiracy theory talk, though I never approach it as anything other than a cold beer/puff puff pass discussion. Have fun with these talks, ask questions, be curious. I tell people all the time the moon is fake because I love the responses. I'm not crazy, they're not crazy,  we're all just trying to get to the bottom of things

       Guess it depends. If you don't want to "lose" them, you'll bite your tongue &amp; not say too much. Somethings are best not to discuss (IMO) with everybody. As you've found out, people get very hyped about their opinions.
      </p>
      <p>
       I used to try to "share" info but not anymore. You can easily tell if they're
       <em>
        locked
       </em>
       into the matrix; keep it moving, don't waste your energy. More important to remain aware &amp; positive.

       It sounds as if your friend doesn't like to use his brain. It probably hurts his head, which is why he gets angry when anyone forces him to think. He's not unlike most Americans in that regard.
      </p>
      <p>
       Personally, I don't talk much about my own "conspiracy theories" as they are called, other than on-line, where my words can reach people who are not unwilling to use their heads for more than hat racks. If somebody watches television every day, and believes what he's told, he isn't ready to think about reality yet. He's so deeply mired in the liberal fantasy narrative, he'd need a shovel and pick to dig his way out.

       I'd let them go, but leave the door ajar incase they want to reach out later. As in, I'd become passive in the relationship but wouldn't actively get rid of them.

       As for my own journey, I've found that people like to ask me for my opinions on a variety of topics because I dripfeed comments here and there. Then when they ask me, I'll be honest but imply I'm not saying everything etc.

       One friend and I talk about all sorts for the last year. Then a couple of weeks back we met up and they asked 'so which conspiracies are definitely true' and in you go with the sales pitch (as it were). They're currently watching as many videos about 9/11 as they can.

       They'll probably come around.  Shit is getting crazier by the day.  I'm in a similar situation.  I have a group text with some of my old college buddies.  I'm always telling them shit. They always argue against me and don't believe.  Few of em probably think I'm off my rocker. But aye,  i figure if i say something it'll be floating in the back of their mind.  Then one day maybe the dots will connect.  I try not to do it too much though.  People are brainwashed by the endless media and distractions we have nowadays.

       Conspiracy theory is alot like sex in the sense that you cant just shove it in. Go easy.   Various niche topics for individual tastes. But be aware that not everyone clicks in that way, and no means no

       Keep a health amount of skepticism within the discussion, rediscover the issue in real time.  Questions questions questions, don't explain what you already know but make the journey to the truth with him all over again.  It will help make the conversation more fun, informative, and strengthen your friendship at the same time so that you can be the real person you are.  Talk less listen more and ask the pertinent questions.  Don't think you have to be someone else to hang with anybody, that causes a lot of social strain and stress on yourself, don't do that it hurts over time, i should know.  I ended up having a psychotic break over spouting conspiracy theories and now even some of my family members and friends just kind of talk behind my back about how I'm doing.  The skepticism part is healthy anyone, I would bet over 90% of the information we digest is less than 10% true due to a variety of reasons, disinformation campaigns being one of them, the 2-5% google web index, etc....If it isn't convincing as you're spouting it off to someone, maybe you should use the skeptic question strategy first.

       My father is by far the "conspiracy theorist" however I entertain enough of the same notions that to people who don't know him view me as the radical thinker.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm in an unusual position where I'm both viewed as a radical thinker by my close friends and yet I view my own father as a bit of a crackpot because he plunges into depths I'm not willing to go to.
      </p>

       General advice? If someone tells you they don't care don't try and send them documentation about how you are right. It doesn't make you look enlightened it makes you look like an ass.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also keep in mind that not everyone who believes MSM is totally ignorant or blind, they may just not have been put into a situation where they were forced to question it.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you are bothered by people who don't accept your viewpoint and confident your viewpoint is right the only viable option is to just go your separate ways. You can't force them to believe what you do, and you aren't going to get the relationship you are hoping for from them.

       You'll note I never said you did. I said don't try to send documentation, it was more general advice for someone who thought that an appropriate follow up to someone expressing they weren't interested was to basically come back at them with "But I can prove it."
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not defensive at all, and to be honest I have no clue where you got that from. Also not sure where you got the idea that I was critical of conspiracy theorists.
      </p>
      <p>
       I take a lot of time formulating my opinion and I expect others to do the same, when they don't I'm critical of their conclusions.

       Well his friend doesn't really sound like a true friend tbh and a few months ago I chose to drop an old "good friend" (bad friend) that sounded eerily similar to OP's buddy. You can either drop him or... Are you chemtrail people just sharing like, a couple backyard photos of chemtrails and being like, "Look they're dropping stuff on us Jimmy!" or are you first sorta citing some more convincing sources like, showing him articles/interviews of retired Air Force personnel who've spoken openly about chemtrails. At least then you can say, "Well, former Lt. Col. of so and so at least wouldn't treat me like an asshole for bringing it up..."

       Only option? Nope. Take You and your Dad for example. You're "bothered" by his more extreme-like (bigfoot? ha) "conspiracy" thoughts on some matters, yet, you still get along great it sounds like.

       Thing is though, I'm not bothered by it. I'm not upset by people believing different things than I do. So it's not an issue for me.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you are bothered by it, and you know someone doesn't agree with you it's silly to repeatedly force yourself to be unhappy around them. That only leads to resentment. I also said only viable option, people are well within their rights to make bad choices, they will just produce bad results.

       I guess I would draw a parallel to people who are always pushing Jesus at you. To them it is obvious and you are a fool not to accept the evidence. It's great to have an interest in something, but if someone doesn't share your interest why keep pushing it on them. It does make you look like a tinfoil hat loon.
