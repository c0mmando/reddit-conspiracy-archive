       I'm saying, no damage was done, Russia and therefore syria were warned ahead of time. After looking at pictures of the airbase and runway and hearing news of planes taking off from their later that day it looks like very little damage was done.
      </p>
      <p>
       To me it's like a false flag was met with false retaliation.
      </p>
      <p>
       The media can either say he is a Russian puppet or say he bombed syria which is directly in conflict with russia.

       I like your explanation the best.
      </p>
      <p>
       Deep state pulls a chess move - damned if you do, damned if you don't scenario. Trump answers with a dodge. He'll attack but not in a way that matters - while informing the Russians of the situation.
      </p>

       Ball is back in the other court, and the media is forced to praise Trump and the military strike.

       Na it's pretty obvious the strike didn't do any damage because the gas attack was a false flag by Assad and Russia. Donald can look tough by bombing an empty runway and make it look like he isn't in bed with Putin.

       Is there proof that they were given a heads up prior to the strike?
      </p>
      <p>
       If Putin can shake off Russian ties accustions, losing a few Syrians and replacing outdated fighter jets is really a small price to pay. Msm is failing pretty hard if thier goal is to destroy assad. The good news is the entire country had an anti war reaction to the missle attack and with Trump being the scapegoat, even the liberals are going aganist msm's agenda.
      </p>
      <p>
       Putin will be puffing his chest more and any direct attacks on Syria will mean possible ww3. Majority of Americans will shit thier pants and will "pressure" Trump to negotiate with Putin.

       Zionism plays a huge role. I'm starting to feel like a robot repeating this so much, but it's relevant these days so here goes...
      </p>
      <p>
       Post WW2 The Network (see Carol Quigley or Joe Plummer) decided it would be advantageous to rebuild Israel in their image. They did this knowing sheepish Christians would blindly back and do Israel's bidding because they couldn't be bothered to actually read the bible. Particularly the part that says Israel was supposed to be rebuilt by God, not by the Balfour Declaration.

       Honestly, of course they are. They are funded by neocons/neoliberals (the same thing) and they have ALWAYS played propaganda machine - their main missions are to divide people, to scare people, and to beat the war drum. Waste of time to even watch them. They're not going to change.

       God I hate neocons and their establishment Democrat counterparts. Knowing you get what you paid for, knowing you can trust their actions will match their words is exactly what I love about politicians like Ron Paul and Bernie. Lack of this solid moral compass is what I despise about most politicians.

       Purge the media and governments of Neocon/Anti-Christs and these blood dances will cease. Claw back the wealth of the 1%. Claw back Constitutional governance. Break the military industrial complex and the Stasi surveillance state. Kick the CFR the hell out and the UN with them. Make it clear

       The worst they can imagine is a United States and Russia alliance. Putin's goal is "to have a normal country." There is no higher goal. Russia and the US are both multi-cultural continental nations with much in common. We could cut the defense budget by 80%. That money can, in turn, be utilized to

       It's the carrot and stick method of mind control. When Trump was doing things the liberals didn't like, he got the stick; but after his missile attack against Assad in Syria, he got the carrot, because he was such a good boy, yes he was, yes he was.

       Anytime anyone uses "President" capitalized in front of "Trump", I assume they're a t_d fanboy. Yes it's technically correct, but it wasn't the norm to use it in front of "Obama", and implies some form of reverence towards the guy, like a proud reminder to everyone that this guy is president.

      <p>
       Someone neutral or unhappy with Trump wouldn't freely award him this title in common conversation.

       I really have a feeling that something is up, something big that they are gonna try and pawn on us. We were either close to something, or something is on the horizon that they need to cover up and distract fast. There is no way the narrative changes that fast and that drastically. This reminds me of a 9/11 era sort of support by the media.

       It kinda scares the shit out of me, not gonna lie. Not only the deception, but the short memory of people. Now im not gonna lie, I was/ am a huge Trump supporter, I was all for him from day one, but this has me worried. He was all anti-war, so hopefully nothing happens. But what is worrying me the most is that a few months ago every other Trump supporter was all anti Hillary for wanting to involve the US in Syria more. Yet here we are like 3 months later and they are calling for intervention and want to bomb the hell of of the middle east. Its not the deception of the media that scares me, because I expect that. It is the gullibility and the lack of memory or insight that people seem to just disregard.
