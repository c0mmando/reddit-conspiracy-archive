<p>We can build an Orbital Ring Space Elevator today, using steel and kevlar. The Orbital Ring goes to low earth orbit, so it does not need advanced materials.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_ring">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_ring</a></p>

<p>Why build the Orbital Ring? It would cut our costs of going to orbit from about $2000/kg to about $1/kg. There are individual asteroids that have tens of trillions of dollars in materials on them that could be mined. One mission could easily pay for the cost of building the Orbital Ring.</p>

<p>We could then deploy solar power satellites in orbit above cloud cover and return the power back to the surface with near zero loss by running power transmission cables down the elevator, and sell the power at a profit.</p>

<p>With increased luminosity in space, enhanced exposure time, and the ability to deliver base loads, solar panels pay for themselves in only 1-2 years while having a 20 year life time.</p>

<p>In other words, if you put $5 trillion of solar panels into space, you get your $5 trillion back by the end of year two and a $5 trillion income stream each year thereafter.</p>

<p>In other words, the US could cut everyone&#39;s taxes, both personal and business, income, capital, death, or otherwise, all to 0%, not even cut any benefits or current spending, and pay off the national debt within a decade.</p>

<p>Yes. <a href="https://archive.4plebs.org/pol/thread/112501241/#q112501374">The first (most expensive) ring would cost about $500B</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>We need to send about 160 million kilograms of material into space (See Birch&#39;s boot strap estimates in part 2: <a href="http://www.orionsarm.com/fm_store/OrbitalRings-II.pdf">http://www.orionsarm.com/fm_store/OrbitalRings-II.pdf</a>)</p>

<p>We have rockets available at $2000/kg costs to LEO today in &quot;mass production&quot; mode, which is only about 10-20 launches per year. Compared with the couple thousand launches necessary for a space elevator, $2000 is an unreasonably high upper bound for launch costs.</p>

<p>We also need to include the cost of materials. A space elevator is about 98% steel and aluminum, 1% kevlar, and 1% other such as superconducting magnets. Most of the mass (98%) cost around $1/kg, with an average cost per kilogram of no more than about $10 per kilogram.</p>

<p>Summing the above up, we get about $430 billion in launch costs plus another $1-2 billion in material costs.</p>

<p>In other words, we can have a space elevator for less than $450 billion - significantly less than one year worth of DoD spending, one bank bailout, many times less than a variety of pointless wars, etc. This is well within our reach financially in other words. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>EVERY TIME. Every time people say that.  Gee whiz, if it could be seen with the naked eye you would think any amateur astronomer could take a decent picture of it with a zoom lens or a telescope.</p>

<p>Either way, I&#39;m not saying there&#39;s nothing up there, just that the idea of people in there wearing gorilla suits and playing flutes and squirting water everywhere is fiction. The videos are being staged elsewhere, not in earth orbit. Human space travel presents many more dangers than the average person is aware of, several of which are insurmountable at the moment.</p>

<p>I like the idea of the orbital ring but it&#39;s much more advanced than a space station and we can&#39;t even do that. For example, what about these asteroids zooming around, would they not pose a threat?</p>

<p>The idea that there are people aboard the space station is fictional, which is what I said, even if there may be something orbiting there as a placeholder. You can literally see wires protruding from their shirts, bubbles coming out of helmets, women&#39;s hair sticking straight up with hairspray instead of floating in zero-gravity, there&#39;s so many signs of fakery and the entire production is frankly so goofy that it&#39;s an insult to watch.</p>

<p>As for the obstacles of space travel, I could name five or six and you wouldn&#39;t care because I&#39;m not a NASA official. I can&#39;t give you a physics lesson over the internet and make you see exactly how complex and forbidding atmospheric re-entry is. If you think the International Shit Show is on the up-and-up you won&#39;t care about the problems with human waste, microorganisms, oxygen, dust, and many other details that are not adequately addressed or explained by NASA.  And the concept of shrugging off the possibility of a meteoroid or asteroid strike just because it&#39;s unlikely, even though it could instantly destroy a multi-billion dollar project and end all lives aboard, is as ridiculous as letting a mother of two young children be a passenger.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t engage in conversation with Redditors who still think the &quot;quote every line of your comment and interpolate it with snarky commentary&quot; is anything but annoying.</p>

<p>If you trust NASA implicitly, fine. You probably think we went to the moon in 1969 with a 32 kB computer and a lunar lander made of gold foil and cardboard. For those of us who don&#39;t trust NASA, it&#39;s easy to call out the bullshit with ISIS. As long as people are so easily convinced by cheap sleight of hand and establishment gatekeepers of science who argue from authority, the hoaxing will continue. </p>

<p>If you can make assertions like &quot;none of these are true,&quot; when they clearly are, you&#39;re not making real arguments. Yes their shirts protrude, yes the women&#39;s hair sticks straight up stiffly, yes you see bubbles, you can&#39;t dispute these things - you can only make feeble and inadequate explanations for why they are.</p>

<p>The stepping outside and being hit by a car thing is stupid. You don&#39;t spend billions of dollars of taxpayer money to do this, for no real reason, not to mention the probability of disaster in space is much higher than walking outside.</p>

<p>There wasn&#39;t any cardboard on the moon landers, and the computer capabilities were assisted with humans doing the calculations back on Earth. It&#39;s ISS, not ISIS. </p>

<p>And of course this is all kind of moot because according to you, they already solved this problem before 1969 since the Apollo missions were huge successes and the asstronots had to pee, poo, sneeze, and spit then too. </p>

<p>But for example, what if you are an astronaut on the moon, 237,000 miles away from home, with no chance of rescue, and you have a <a href="https://youtu.be/VJfO4mBiJQo?t=54s">horrific fall</a>, and knowing that your life could quickly end with one slight tear in your suit, leaving you to die painfully in the dead of space, or even a sprained ankle could mean the end of the mission, and you&#39;re totally not just dicking around in the safe confines of a film studio, I mean surely that guy shit his pants a little bit.

<p>Well you certainly hope you can hold it in long enough to go back inside, seal the airlock, pressurize the airlock, take off your huge spacesuit, open the airlock, float down the corridors of the station, and use the complicated array of garden hoses, funnels, and assorted dials that NASA wants us to think is the super-duper high tech space-shitting technology. Ideally one can hold it that long..</p>

<p>Do you have some kind of bowel issue? How often are you shitting?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But for example, what if you are an astronaut on the moon, 237,000 miles away from home, with no chance of rescue, and you have a horrific fall, and knowing that your life could quickly end with one slight tear in your suit, leaving you to die painfully in the dead of space, or even a sprained ankle could mean the end of the mission, and you&#39;re totally not just dicking around in the safe confines of a film studio, I mean surely that guy shit his pants a little bit. So what do you do then?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Quickly, better tell anyone whose ever done anything remotely risky that they&#39;re wrong.</p>

<p>I wonder if Neil Armstrong knew his life was in danger during his decade as a military test pilot?</p>

<p>I dunno, maybe they just use the same stuff they use on Earth?</p>

<p>They would, which is why the ISS is fortified on the high risky regions. Also the main problem its not asteroids but rather debris from other space-related endeavours. </p>

<p>Yes, the debris would have to be cleaned up first.</p>
