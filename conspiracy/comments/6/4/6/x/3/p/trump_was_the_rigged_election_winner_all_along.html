<p>99% of the braindead military is back on the side of the state.  Throwing a &quot;populist&quot; Republican into office was just a jewish trick to appease the military, which is very Republican</p>

<p>We were all duped, we thought Hillary was set up to win for free, when she was the fall guy all along.  We&#39;ve been had</p>

<p>They&#39;ll wait for the military to be uberpatriot again, and then switch to a democrat to appease the democrats for 4-8 years.  Watch, after Trump we will have Ted Cruz or Mike Pence, I promise you.  Screenshot this and hold onto it for 2020 and 2024</p>

<p>It is not about being true believers, anyone with the seed of Jacob running their veins has the choice while the other 17 nations do not have a choice and are free to do as they will.</p>

<p>This is what the elite at the tippy top keep in hiding. That all 17 other nations are damned and this is where they draw their demonic power from. The secret is, only one group of people can sin and they are not that group of people.</p>

<p>This is why Aleister Crowley led the &quot;Do as thou wilt&quot; narrative. Because Satan is of the flesh, he is the lust and temptation that we all feel and deal with everyday. Because only one nation of people can be judged, those at the tippy top worship Satan because they know they are already damned. </p>

<p>This is also why the Bible plays such a heavy role in our current global situation.</p>
