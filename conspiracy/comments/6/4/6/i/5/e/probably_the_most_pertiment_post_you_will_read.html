       Last night, sometimes before midnight, a tornado siren I assume sounded here for about 30 seconds.  Kicked on, and I was like wtf.  Tests are done at 1030 every Tuesday and runs for 2 minutes.  Last night was like 30 seconds in middle of the night.  Who knows

       I think we as citizens need to watch out for anything-
From the slightest movements to the most ambiguous. We can only assume that the military intelligence that was forwarded to trump was significant enough that he would have acted the way he did...

       This is going to persist until the media once again sides with the people and the world is calm again-

       Idk, I'm on the fence about
       <em>
        if you see something, say something
       </em>
       . 90% of the time, it's racial profiling or someone forgot a backpack. It's not the duty of the average citizen to be suspicious and vigilant. Observant, sure.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I'm not immune to terror because I live in America. That's part of the problem, the arrogant attitude that millions of people on this planet live in a daily state of war (some caused by our military) and we're supposed to be entitled to adequate food, sanitation and water PLUS physical and fanancial security, simply by the chance of our birth?!
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd rather live in a society with mutual trust that people aren't out to harm me, and will kindly respond in the case of emergency, because, as someone with PTSD, I already deal with enough depression and anxiety. I can't add paranoia about war. If it's my time, it's my damn time...

       I don't know that sounds like a plausible coincidence to me. I think you're drawing symbolic importance from this but ultimately what is the purpose? 10% of the population might now be subconsciously primed for an attack? Although the fact that air raid sirens are generally creepy as hell and particularly creepy at a time we see the geopolitical pattern begin to amplify and become chaotic makes me get where you're coming from.

We bombed a foreign military's airstrip...
