Sometimes it leads you to really amazing revelations such as the MkUltra program, and the CIA being involved with drug trafficking. </p>

<p>What kills the legitimacy of this sub is the rampant anti Jewish sentiments lurking under the surface. I don&#39;t see how anyone here can condone these attitudes with any for of sincerity. I understand that the middle eastern turmoils have caused a lot of confusion, but blaming an entire race and creed of people is too easy of an answer to solve these problems. </p>

<p>Ironically a lot of ultra orthodox jewery has staunch stances against the legitimacy of the Zionist movement, and firmly refuses to recognize Isreal as a Jewish nation, rather than speaking modern Hebrew they choose instead to speak Yiddish as not to corrupt what they believe is a holy tongue. What may seem like a blatant conspiracy does not stand up to the fact that jewery today is very splintered and the political, religious sects all differ on a variety of spectrums regarding what Isreal means to them.</p>

<p>Sorry to disappoint anyone with the facts, but the conversations on here are going way too far down the stormfront path for anyone to take this sub seriously.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Most here recognize the difference between Zionists (you do not have to be a Jew to be a Zionist) and &quot;Jews&quot;. We get trolls and brigades who &quot;try&quot; to paint this sub racist. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve been here for a long time, and it&#39;s really far from it. Joshua Ryne Goldberg would be a great example, and there are whole subs dedicated to this (not too mention Hasbara units in Israel). To keep the persecution mentality alive within the Jewish people&#39;s mind. Pretty psychopathic if you ask me. Not too mention all the hoax hate crimes....</p>

<p>Anyways. I&#39;m not seeing what you are saying... So...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Mhmm. TBF, all countries have propaganda units, the difference is most want to portray their people as strong. Israel wants to portray they are are a poor little kid constantly being picked on, even though they have an arsenal of fuckin&#39; nuclear warheads (with a Samson Option - blow the entire world up if they are attacked, the US included). Which for the most part is never talked about. </p>

<p>I suggest not casually reading this sub via new. That&#39;s the wrong way. Participate in the new. You&#39;ll see what I&#39;m saying, and hey, maybe you will TIL a few things and have some good convos. </p>

I had this argument with several people and it&#39;s baffling how willfully blind everyone seems to be about the rampant bigotry on the sub. I mean, this is the same sub that had linked a YouTube channel of a (self-described) Neo Nazi and his videos about how wonderful of a guy Hitler was. How do people still think that all these Jew-haters are just &quot;false flag trolls&quot;?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Right, I forgot about option 4: redefining a 100+ year old phrase to skirt the issue entirely. (FYI, most Israeli Jews are actually Middle Eastern, either Sephardi, Persian, Yemenite, Syrian, Morrocan, or Algerian.)</p>

<p>Answer me this before we continue, do you also correct people who use the term &quot;bathroom&quot; to refer to a room with only a toilet and no bath?</p>

<p>&quot;Anti-Semite&quot; was popularized in the 19th century by people who used it to refer to <em>themselves</em> the term retained its use throughout the years during which many people (including dignitaries such as Henry Ford) proudly referred to themselves as such.</p>

<p>Only in the last decade or so had anti-Semites started shying away from their bigotry by claiming that &quot;well since I only hate <em>Jews</em> and 51% of Jews aren&#39;t Semites, then I can&#39;t be an anti-Semite!&quot; despite what Encyclopedia Brittanica, Oxford English Dictionary, Merriam Webster, and literally every other reputable source over the last century states. </p>

<p>Yeah, well, it&#39;s a very small MINORITY who have the nerve to speak out against the Zionist Regime and their international operatives - and that gives the APPEARANCE that the vast majority of Jews SUPPORT their shit.</p>

<p>If you want that perception to change, you - THE ENTIRE JEWISH COMMUNITY -need to reign in the Zionist bastards - because they are DEPENDENT on YOU and YOUR efforts to continue what they do.</p>

<p>If you - AS A GROUP - fail to take action to stop their shit, then you  - AS A GROUP - will be seen as complicit and CULPABLE in their crimes, and JEWS, AS INDIVIDUALS, will suffer the consequences - REGARDLESS of whether individual Jews were guilty or not.</p>

<p>Sorry chum, but that&#39;s the way shit works in the REAL WORLD.</p>

<p>Examples -  Germany, WW2: Do you think that MOST of the German people wanted the Holocaust to happen? NO! HELL NO!!! Almost no common Germans were AWARE of what was actually going on... did that SAVE the common Germans from the MASS RAPE AND MURDER that the raging Russian troops thrust on them?</p>

<p>NO!</p>

<p>Did it save the common Germans from the punishing reprisal and DECADES of reparations that Jews DEMANDED of them for what THEIR GOVERNMENT DID???</p>

<p>NO!!!</p>

<p>And it won&#39;t save YOU, as a Jew, or ME, as an American from suffering the consequences of the actions that OTHERS take IN OUR NAMES.</p>

<p>THAT, friend, is why I am SCREAMING at the top of my lungs, trying like HELL to stop this insane shit - JUST AS I WAS in 2002/ 2003, TRYING to stop the fucking invasion of Iraq.</p>

<p>I am taking a STAND against the idiotic and EVIL actions that MY government is about to undertake - LARGELY to benefit ZIONISM. If I fail, there is a VERY good chance that I and my fellow countrymen will pay a HEAVY PRICE.</p>

<p>YOU, AS A JEW, ARE NOT EXEMPT, friend. What? You think you get a &quot;special pass&quot;? Good luck. You, like I, WILL BE HELD LIABLE for what OTHERS do in OUR names.</p>

<p>I am taking a stand.</p>

<p>You are WHINING and making excuses <strong><em>&quot;but not ALL Jews...&quot;</em></strong></p>

<p>Excuses don&#39;t fucking matter at the end of the day. </p>

<p>TAKE YOUR STAND NOW - AND CONVINCE YOUR FELLOWS TO DO LIKEWISE.</p>

<p>Has 2,000 years of &quot;suffering&quot; in Diaspora taught you NOTHING???</p>

<p>Happy Passover. Do yourself and your brethren a favor - take a STAND, and convince them that it is ALSO in THEIR best interests to do so.</p>

<p>Shalom.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Apparently you didn&#39;t read what I wrote. </p>

<p>Your are arguing from a philosophical perspective <em>how you think things should be</em>, whereas I am speaking from a perspective of realism - <em>the way things are</em>, based on hard lessons from history and human nature. </p>

<p>It&#39;s not about what I want, it&#39;s about reality - the law of cause and effect: Actions (or inaction) produce reactions/ results - oftentimes these are quite predictable - both in science, and in societal settings.</p>

<p>I am not wishing for bad things to happen to you and yours, I am trying to <em>prevent</em> bad things from happening - and I am hoping that I can convince you and your fellows to help, because the ramifications will no doubt affect us all  - Jews and Americans - in very unpleasant ways.</p>

<p>There is a strange quirk in human nature that tends to make believe that bad things happen TO us <em>(poor innocent me!)</em>, while rejecting the harsh reality that, in most cases, we - as individuals or groups, played a significant role in shaping the circumstances that led to calamitous outcomes.</p>

<p>That, friend, is a very dangerous error, for in dismissing the roles we played in the creation of our history, we fail to learn from our mistakes, and set ourselves up for future calamities.   </p>

<p>Take care.</p>

<p>You do realize a majority of swastika tagging has been proven to be done by tribal members themselves. With that said, online tagging of things that are hatred and demeaning &quot;verbally&quot;, on various forms of social media as well as MSM comment sections has been proven to be done by groups representing the same factions. </p>

But when the next instance of antisemitism happens, it&#39;ll be shouted from the rooftops once again. I see a pattern. Alot of us see a pattern. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What&#39;s your question? I&#39;m talking about a month where the front page and sidebar had stickied and linked to a YouTube series called &quot;The Greatest Story Never Told&quot; which was a collection of clips from the History Channel, BBC, and other places interrupted by text commentary talking about how it was wrong, Hitler was a real stand up guy, and the Jews were really at fault for all of this. It was really popular on this subreddit and I still see it linked from time to time. The creator was  a self-professed Neo-Nazi.</p>

<p>????</p>

<p>There&#39;s a ton of information out there. You should try the Holocaust Museum or any major Holocaust website. They all discuss the persecuted minorities in great detail. Thing is, they didn&#39;t have as much documentation because the subgroups were much smaller than the Jews. The next largest group in the death camps were the Roma and they numbered at less than a million. Still, there&#39;s a metric ton of info out there <a href="https://www.ncas.rutgers.edu/center-study-genocide-conflict-resolution-and-human-rights/romani-porajmos">if</a> you <a href="http://isurvived.org/TOC-I.html#I-7_Romanies">look</a> for <a href="http://annefrank.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Roma-Holocaust-FactSheet.pdf">it</a>. The gays actually faced continued persecution by liberating troops, so their story was mostly covered up. </p>
