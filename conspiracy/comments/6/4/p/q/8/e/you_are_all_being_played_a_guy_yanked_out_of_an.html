       I saw the video.  He refused to get up and they pulled him out of his chair.  During the struggle his head appeared to hit an arm rest, and that's what knocked him out.  The close quarters involved may have had an impact.  I am the last to apologize for police misconduct, and spend many hours calling it out.  I don't think this qualifies.

       I agree this is not one sided.

       The way he dragged him across the aisle looked humiliating though.
      </p>
      <p>
       At least carry the man. These officers looked strong enough. I know how hard it is to remove someone that doesn't want to cooperate and said individual doesn't have to be a strongman either for it to be difficult. It's just the approach they used overall.

       Is pulling a paying customer off of a plane bc an airline is pulling some shade shit a lawful duty? The police can be wrong too bud even if they were just following orders. Fighting is different than standing up for yourself. This guy yelled and flailed though...lol so that should definitely be considered

       Ya they'd most likely get off in court due to some vague fine print if it came to it. Although I'm not one of those guys taking every chance I get to trip the police on the lines of the law, admittedly I was a lil triggered at the implication that you must always obey the police

        Airlines set their own "boarding priorities" -- the order in which they will bump different categories of passengers in an oversale situation.
        <strong>
         When a flight is oversold and there are not enough volunteers, some airlines bump passengers with the lowest fares first. Others bump the last passengers to check in.
        </strong>
        Once you have purchased your ticket, the most effective way to reduce the risk of being bumped is to get to the airport early. For passengers in the same fare class the last passengers to check in are usually the first to be bumped, even if they have met the check-in deadline. Allow extra time; assume that the roads are backed up, the parking lot is full, and there is a long line at the check-in counter.

       I wouldn't have said it like that lol but yea it does feel like another friendly distraction brought to you by the unsavory-untouchables, Facebook doesn't care about anything serious and it's everywhere.

       I apparently cant post
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qAPi7q040U">
        this video
       </a>
       on r/videos of law enforcement wearing ski masks and threatening drug dealers because it was deemed to be "political."
      </p>
      <p>
       So yeah, getting people on reddit to care about certain things is increasingly difficult.
      </p>
      <p>
       One thing that really irks me is the fact that I am an artist who cannot post links to my artwork from my own website on r/art; I have to post it on imgur or any other approved websites.

       The tone and imagery of that video are a little extreme, but I agree with the message. Heroin and opioids are quite a serious problem, especially in Florida. Having lost a few friends to these kinds of drugs, I think these heroin dealers deserve what's coming to them.

       Then you're looking in the wrong place. ISIS-5-0 in the OP can no-knock raid all the small time heroin pushers that they want. Perdue Pharmaceuticals is gonna keep pushing prescription opiates on the public, the CIA is gonna keep bringing in heroin from those nice Afghani poppy fields our troops have been protecting, Insys Pharmaceuticals is gonna keep the fentanyl flowing out to the streets to get mixed in with the bags of h, and people are still going to die.

       Drug addicts don't need excuses like that to do drugs. I used to get high because it was raining and then get high because it was sunny. The problem is prescription pain killers being over proscribed and then easy access to heroin which is way cheaper.

       ooh story time; i live in tampa and there used to be a heroin dealer across the street from me; one day i saw a van with us navy license plates leave the dope house; probably unrelated but gave me a raging conspiracy boner seeing as the VA is also down the street (all within a few blocks of each other)

       when the police are dealing with drugs and drug dealers sometimes they buy from the dealer (undercover) to ensure they have the right person ..when they go to make an arrest or when the search warrant is served!!  The reason they wear masks is to conceal their identities... Otherwise the dealer would realize he sold to a narc and that specific strategy would become ineffective!

       The most dangerous part of illegal drugs is the police who enforce the bullshit laws. Not just the bullshit laws that criminalize drugs, but also the bullshit laws that limit your economic opportunities and make life so shitty that people feel the need to escape.

       when I was 19 or 20 I was on the opposing end of the situation I previously described.. I walked into the hallway of my apartment building and was confronted by 4 to 5 fairly big cops all wearing bullet proof vests and dark clothes with ski masks and guns drawn and i was like a deer in headlights... I had no idea they were cops until they had me in cuffs.. 
Then I saw that on the back of the vests it said police or whatever .. 
From my point of view  I was a 19 year old female (at the time I didn't have anything illegal on me even ) .. pretty much getting accosted by four or 5 masked men​ an obvious threat to my life ..and well being.. for doing what I needed to get by 
From the point of view of the cops that arrested me.. they were doing there jobs, they had been called numerous times by the people I lived by..
From the point of view of my neighbors, I was disruptive and as a result of my choices I was potentially putting them in harms way for my actions ..( everyone should have the right to be able to live with the expectation to have a safe place to live without a threat of danger ..)
      </p>
      <p>
       That was when I was 19 or 20 ..  I will be 26 on the 22nd of this month.. also I live in Canada.. 
 the point I'm trying to make is that it's not a new tactic ..
      </p>
      <p>
       My personal opinion however is that there are WAY WAY better approaches when it comes to drug related issues .. prosecuting, and imprisoning people that have drug issues is not effective ... There are countries that tackled drug issues in more productive and positive ways and have been successful.. Canada , the US and other countries should learn from that and implement a similar approach
...

       I agree with you. And if you're going to follow conspiracies you have to be open to more than one school of thought or plausible reality. The masks make sense if they're indeed undercover agents. You can't deny every individuals choices that lead to their current situation in life. And implying that the decision to do heroin didn't ruin their life and it was the police is a bit ridiculous.

       I hate these types of posts.  There's ALWAYS something worse.  Right now, for example, there are children dying of starvation.  Now, that's pretty bad - unless you look at all the families being dumped into mass graves somewhere.  Seems pretty bad right?  There's worse going on.  Daily.  Just because someone actually has video footage of an incident doesn't mean "Welp, that's it.  This is all I am going to watch for the next 6 months".  No.  There are concurrent other events happening right now - there's just no video of it.  There will be something else just as bad or worse in the future - perhaps with video - that will occurr.  Then everyone will watch that and be outraged.
      </p>
      <p>
       Point being - don't think everyone is 'being played' because of this event.  It's just the current event.  Nothing too special about it.  I'm not saying that media doesn't manipulate its viewers, but saying we are all 'being played' because a recent event occurred and everyone's talking about it just seems small-minded.

       It's not that there is always worse stuff happening, it's that there is something happening that can lead to WW3 and effects every single person in the US (and other parts of the world) but instead, the media is parroting about a man getting kicked off a flight and the mindless masses eat it up and regurgitate it like a mother bird feeding it's young.

       Right?!?!? Isn't it possible to be concerned about more than one thing at a time?  Isn't it possible to be upset about the United incident and still acknowledge that there are other problems?  My Facebook feed today is a lot of people guilt tripping everyone. "While you all are botching and moaning about United Airlines gay people are being murdered in concentration camps in Chechnya!" Yes. And more people are probably latching on to the United incident because it's more local and they feel they can at least boycott the airline. Nobody has told me a damn thing I can do about Chechnya and I don't know where to start.

       If someone is able to catch an act of injustice on video and it goes viral, it's going to get the attention of the public, no matter what it is.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yeah, no one would have cared about Eric Garner had it not been captured on video and that video going viral and that goes for Michael Brown or Walter Scott and etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       It sure sucks for the people who's death or beating wasn't caught on video.

       Yes, people should pay more attention to police brutality in general.  But this specific case deserves attention too. No one is getting "played."
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, when a story get this famous it makes it easier for all the other people who complain about police abuse to make their point.  So let's talk about all of it.

       I disagree. The fact that this happens in the US is part of the gradual desensitizing of society to martial rule. It's one and the same thing. You should be mad at the dragging off a plane of a fair paying passenger just the same as all the other police atrocities. This game of whataboutism is the more obvious problem.

       this guy gets it, the UA news is definitely a distractor. You have to suspect something is up when the entire MSM swarms all over this story like flies around fresh shit. This doctor's criminal history is just way to convenient. Airlines overbook all the time and no one is ever dragged off for not volunteering. The UA thing happened because "they" made it happen. Keep your eyes peeled people.

       Do people not realize that this guy thought he was wealthy and special and entitled, and that he wanted a poorer passenger, who had paid more for their ticket no less, to be kicked off the flight instead?

       I agree with you. And if you're going to follow conspiracies you have to be open to more than one school of thought or plausible reality. The masks make sense if they're indeed undercover agents. You can't deny every individuals choices that lead to their current situation in life. And implying that the decision to do heroin didn't ruin their life and it was the police is a bit ridiculous.
