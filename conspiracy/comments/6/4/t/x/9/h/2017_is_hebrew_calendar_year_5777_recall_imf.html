<p>Hebrew calendar year 5777 (2016-2017) ends on <a href="https://www.google.com/search?ei=GkbtWNDyJsKQ0gLRsL-AAw&amp;q=rosh+hashanah+2017&amp;oq=R&amp;gs_l=mobile-gws-serp.1.0.41l3j0l2.121334.125067.0.127029.16.10.0.1.1.0.520.2279.0j6j1j2j0j1.10.0....0...1c.1.64.mobile-gws-serp..14.2.411.3.w6PrbmRJ9A8">Wednesday September 20</a> therefore the &quot;danger zone&quot; is until then.</p>

<p>Kushner&#39;s 666 Fifth Avenue building was constructed by Tishman Co. <a href="https://archive.is/vT0FQ">who also built the WTC Twin Towers and WTC-7</a>.</p>

<p>For those who have a detective bent, it may be advantageous to calculate significant numerological dates before September 20 (such as length between dates using 7s or triple-digits) or triple-digit days-of-the-calendar year using <a href="http://www.timeanddate.com">http://www.timeanddate.com</a>, or to consider Occult dates of significance such as April 30, June 21, etc.</p>

<p>I will make the educated guess that one particular &quot;auspicious target&quot; for such an &quot;auspicious&quot; Hebrew Year number would be the destruction of Temple Mount in Jerusalem, which contains the &quot;Twin Temples/Towers&quot; of Dome of the Rock &amp; Al Aqsa mosque.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_Temple">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_Temple</a></p>

<p>The destruction of Temple Mount is necessary for the arrival of &quot;Antichrist&quot; according to Christian eschatology.</p>

<p>Putin has spoken of Temple Mount&#39;s significance here, in reference to its political importance:  <a href="https://www.google.com/search?ei=v0rtWNXLE8fajwOTkru4Cg&amp;q=temple+mount+putin&amp;oq=temple+mount+putin&amp;gs_l=mobile-gws-serp.12...295832.301778.0.302652.27.16.0.0.0.0.0.0..0.0....0...1c.1.64.mobile-gws-serp..27.0.0.sHqpid4abec">https://www.google.com/search?ei=v0rtWNXLE8fajwOTkru4Cg&amp;q=temple+mount+putin&amp;oq=temple+mount+putin&amp;gs_l=mobile-gws-serp.12...295832.301778.0.302652.27.16.0.0.0.0.0.0..0.0....0...1c.1.64.mobile-gws-serp..27.0.0.sHqpid4abec</a></p>

<p>(I am not anti-Putin, not anti-Trump, not anti-Clinton, not anti-Sanders, and not anti-Judaism, but Kushner gives me reason for concern).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>i don&#39;t like his power under trump, that&#39;s a given. too much nepotism and princely sort of castle dynamics, but kushner the person besides of course colluding with russia in all sorts of nefarious ways hasn&#39;t really been a cause for concern any more than trump or the others on the administration. he&#39;s played a role bringing us and russia closer? i honestly haven&#39;t come across a theory like that.</p>

<p>He then went on to ask an actual, well put question, literally saying &quot;please tell me more&quot; and you don&#39;t respond. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>(1)  I&#39;m on mobile, at work, with battery issues, and my lunch hour was done.  So your presumption is mistaken</p>

<p>(2)  Since he misquoted me and asked me a question about his misquote (I said that Kushner brought Russia &amp; the U.S. closer to war, not &quot;closer&quot;), it looks like a forum slide.  Weird.</p>

<p>(3)  Since he asked me &quot;why?&quot; to a comment I made elsewhere in the thread, yet cut/pasted onto a completely different comment I made ... why do that?  Two innocent mistakes in two comments.  Yet they both serve the bottom line effect of misdirecting.  Weird.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>(1) I didn&#39;t make a presumption. I said you didn&#39;t respond. And you didn&#39;t. So what if you&#39;re at work? Am I expected to know this? </p>

<p>(2) Wow, must be a paid government shill, right? Didn&#39;t quote you EXACTLY. Mistakes don&#39;t happen I guess. </p>

<p>(3) He asked why for clarification to your extremely far-fetched observations. To be fair, as far as I can see, the biggest case you have for Kushner being a cause for concern is his &quot;affinity for triple digits&quot; and the fact that Tishman Co. (who&#39;ve built thousands of NYC office/private buildings) constructed his building, addressed 666 . Implying anyone who doesn&#39;t blindly believe you is a shill is ridiculous, you do have some pretty hefty claims. He asked for further reasoning. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>should I answer his question about a statement I never made while I&#39;m busy at work? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, no one knew you were working, &quot;seriously LOL&quot; you&#39;re pretty obnoxious.  Kind of goes against common sense to post a thread right before a time you know you won&#39;t be able to respond but okay.  </p>

<p>Just tell the dude you didn&#39;t say that, or that he misread you, or just explain why you don&#39;t like Kushner, because I didn&#39;t see too much reason to think of him as a cause for concern based on what you&#39;ve posted. </p>

<p>Ashes in the sky, Satan already being in control (The internet world wide web) WWW. = 666 because W is the 6th letter of the hebrew alphabet.</p>

<p>Today everyone gets everything from the internet or the TV.</p>

<p>Satan has already been in control for a bit, probably about 3.5 years.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>5777 days between 9/11 and 7/7/17, in the year 5777.</p>

<p>That&#39;s a little bit difficult to overlook as &quot;coincidence&quot;.</p>

<p>And &quot;Deep Events&quot;, to use the PDS terminology, are public human sacrifice rituals which usher in a &quot;new era&quot; or &quot;new dispensation&quot;.</p>

<p>With a 777 president and a 666 high priest advisor or shadow president (or perhaps, by July 7, Vice President and then President, via the Gerald Ford unelected blueprint).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>(1)  I&#39;m on mobile, at work, with battery issues, and my lunch hour was done.  So your presumption is mistaken</p>

<p>(2)  Since he misquoted me and asked me a question about his misquote (I said that Kushner brought Russia &amp; the U.S. closer to war, not &quot;closer&quot;), it looks like a forum slide.  Weird.</p>

<p>(3)  Since he asked me &quot;why?&quot; to a comment I made elsewhere in the thread, yet cut/pasted onto a completely different comment I made ... why do that?  Two innocent mistakes in two comments.  Yet they both serve the bottom line effect of misdirecting.  Weird.</p>

<p>So dude seriously LOL should I answer his question about a statement I never made while I&#39;m busy at work?  </p>
