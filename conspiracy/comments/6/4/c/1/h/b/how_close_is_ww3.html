       I keep reading/hearing that experts claim we are closer to WW3 now than we were during the Cuban Missile Crisis.
      </p>
      <p>
       Russia hot war confrontations in Ukraine and Syria.  Build up near the Baltics.
      </p>
      <p>
       China confrontations in South China Sea and North Korea.
      </p>
      <p>
       Raised tensions, heightened rhetoric, complicated/esoteric alliance systems.

       I don't think Russia will defend Syria if NATO, Turkey, Saudi Arabia are w/ USA..

       If they can disprove the 'chemical sarin attack' than they might have more leverage.

       Turkey's status is unclear. While they are a member of NATO, two years ago NATO warned Turkey they would not defend Turkey if attacked by Russia. They're kind of pissed.  Erdogan was been courting both NATO and Russia.
      </p>
      <p>
       Turkey started that whole thing with the Netherlands the other week. What was it Erdogan said? Something like "Netherlands has 50,000 troops, while there are 400,000 Turks already living in the Netherlands." It was clearly a threat.

       i think they should shove WW3 up their asses. but it looks kind of like it.

i hope it takes ten years.

       Don't forget Erdogan. He is currently expanding Turkey by snatching up Syrian land. To his west lies Greece, which is barely even a country anymore. The guy is trying to rebuild the Ottoman Empire, imho.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yemen is a proxy war with Iran. Iranians continue to challenge US warships.
      </p>
      <p>
       20 million refugees have flooded Europe. That's a very big problem because Europe can't possibly employ all these people. People tend to get a little radical when they can't see a light at the end of the tunnel.
      </p>
      <p>
       Realize, too--Over the past two years, the United States has dropped a bomb on Syria/Iraq once every 20 minutes, on average. For. Two. Whole. Years. These people don't hate us "for our freedom." They hate us because we killed half their family.
      </p>
      <p>
       I agree that we are closer to WW3 than ever before. I'm half-convinced we've passed the point of no return. I very much hope I'm wrong.

       I don't think Erdogen is part of the NWO he's gone off on his own script. The NATO nukes were removed from his country and he's purged all the opposition in his country.

       You can say what you want, but I think we have to thank Russia for its patience and cautious politics. The West has been provoking Russia for so many years to inflate a worldwide conflict but Putin remains sane. It seems that Putin is absolutely aware of the 'Plan For The New American Century', he knows what is reaction is expected from the globalists to bring Russia into war. As ridiculious it may sound for some of you, but Russia is our only hope right now.

       I don't think there's going to be a WW3 at this moment, just the same old bullshit where some people from one corner of the world kill people from another corner of them world.
      </p>
      <p>
       Which in turn leads to terrorism, both as blowback of state atrocities as well as the unintended consequences of backing militants, false-flags, etc.

       As long as there's money to be made for the lobbyists and defense contractors, and as long as Israel feels it is not the sole hegemon in the middle-east region, there will continue to be war. Just not world war.

       I totally agree. But Trump isn't capable of thinking that deeply or long term. He is all about posturing and power and North Korea is actually crazy. They have nothing to lose and if they think the U.S is moving in its game over. The situation in Syria is a whole different story.

       Your average red-blooded American, Syrian, Iraqi, Ukrainian, Russian, etc. don't want a WW3. There's nothing in it for them. The government is using it as a crutch to prop up the economy and to reappropriate resources such as oil and natural gas.

       I agree with you. Plus, this generation has an "advantage" in that we've not seen peace since 9/11 and we are so sick of conflict already. We've been duped so many times about motives for going into new countries that it's just not working anymore. The tired, trotted out lines look like tired desperation; not a matter of urgent national security.

       I agree, however, I would say that our petty "conflicts" of today pale in comparison to real wars such as WW1/2. Today's men and women do not know war. I would say that most Americans have forgotten what true war looks like.

       Most Americans have not seen WWI and WWII so you're right... but I also think those kinds of wars are antiquated in the era of nukes, cyber warfare, and drones.

       It's a different type of war. One of occupation and survival. Americans did all right. A bit insane, but nothing wrong with that(adds a little spice). That said, generalities are always wrong. There's a lot of truth in what you say. But again, generalities.

       We send professional soldiers to fight goat herders and farmers in foreign lands with little to no familiarity with the culture and traditions. The War on Terror only created more problems and suffering and it didn't solve a single thing regarding terrorism. At least with a global (non-nuclear) war, there would be an end to it and the winner would take all.
      </p>
      <p>
       I like to think that WW3 will be the war that will end all wars and unify the planet as one. We would then be able to finally expand humanity outwards to space and focus on solving societal and economical issues, not creating more.

       I don't know why everyone is getting a hard-on to generate this "happening" or end-of-times. I don't mean you, by the way... but if I dare venture into 4chan it's like we should all be living in the stone age by now because the world would have been blown to smithereens 5 times over. If a warship dare uses fuel it's decreed as a sign of imminent war.

       I think we are in it, and the US is about to be on the business end of a world that is sick of their shit. I live in the US, so I obviously have mixed feelings about this. But I really don't see how we get a global reset without euthanizing most of our government.

       Think today has parraels with Europe between 1935 to the outbreak of war. The war is going with everyone either trying to ignore or placate the aggressor in the hope it doesn't expand further.

       No matter how good politicians can read or think they can read the situation or (worse) prove they can read the situation I think were bound for worse.

       Most likely a Dr Strangelove situation with someone with access to the trigger of nuclear missiles. Real trouble is the rich and powerful don't care about the outcome. Been building bomb shelters for years cause they know it with the only matter being they make more money and they and theirs is safe.

       I don't know but having the US shoot missiles on Syria while Russian troops are on the ground seem like an "accident" waiting to happen...
