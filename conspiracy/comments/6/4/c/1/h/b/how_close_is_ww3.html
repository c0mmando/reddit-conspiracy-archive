<p>Turkey started that whole thing with the Netherlands the other week. What was it Erdogan said? Something like &quot;Netherlands has 50,000 troops, while there are 400,000 Turks already living in the Netherlands.&quot; It was clearly a threat.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t forget Erdogan. He is currently expanding Turkey by snatching up Syrian land. To his west lies Greece, which is barely even a country anymore. The guy is trying to rebuild the Ottoman Empire, imho.</p>

<p>Yemen is a proxy war with Iran. Iranians continue to challenge US warships. </p>

<p>20 million refugees have flooded Europe. That&#39;s a very big problem because Europe can&#39;t possibly employ all these people. People tend to get a little radical when they can&#39;t see a light at the end of the tunnel.</p>

<p>Realize, too--Over the past two years, the United States has dropped a bomb on Syria/Iraq once every 20 minutes, on average. For. Two. Whole. Years. These people don&#39;t hate us &quot;for our freedom.&quot; They hate us because we killed half their family.</p>

<p>I agree that we are closer to WW3 than ever before. I&#39;m half-convinced we&#39;ve passed the point of no return. I very much hope I&#39;m wrong. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You can say what you want, but I think we have to thank Russia for its patience and cautious politics. The West has been provoking Russia for so many years to inflate a worldwide conflict but Putin remains sane. It seems that Putin is absolutely aware of the &#39;Plan For The New American Century&#39;, he knows what is reaction is expected from the globalists to bring Russia into war. As ridiculious it may sound for some of you, but Russia is our only hope right now. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s as close as &#39;we the people <em>allow it</em>&#39;</p>

<p>The ONLY people who <em>want war</em> are those who make money out of it! </p>

<p>It really is that simple, and after WW2 there were a LOT of people who had made a shitload from &quot;US Govt war contracts&quot; and this group became known as the Military <em>Industril Complex</em> ,, becoz it was All the manufacturers of weapons.</p>

<p>Dwight Eisenhower <em>tried to warn</em> the people of the US of the dangers of &quot;allowing these companies to continue&quot; as they <em>need war to make a Profit</em>!</p>

<p>The LAST thing these guys want is Peace!</p>

<p>Until companies like Halliburton and Dyncorp, together with the Federal Reserve are dismantled this farcical &quot;fearmongering&quot; will continue</p>

<p>The biggest &#39;dangers&#39; for a real &#39;hot&#39; nuclear war are Israel and Iran and Pakistan and India </p>

<p>Not Russia or China, who know better than that</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What experts?</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know why everyone is getting a hard-on to generate this &quot;happening&quot; or end-of-times. I don&#39;t mean you, by the way... but if I dare venture into 4chan it&#39;s like we should all be living in the stone age by now because the world would have been blown to smithereens 5 times over. If a warship dare uses fuel it&#39;s decreed as a sign of imminent war.</p>

<p>Anyway, no, I&#39;m inclined to agree that this is the sound of a dying regime (western power brokers) trying to lord over a dying economic model (oil). </p>

<p>It is not really the view in the USA where they are trying to get us all cocked up for war.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Think today has parraels with Europe between 1935 to the outbreak of war. The war is going with everyone either trying to ignore or placate the aggressor in the hope it doesn&#39;t expand further.</p>

<p>No matter how good politicians can read or think they can read the situation or (worse) prove they can read the situation I think were bound for worse.</p>

<p>Most likely a Dr Strangelove situation with someone with access to the trigger of nuclear missiles. Real trouble is the rich and powerful don&#39;t care about the outcome. Been building bomb shelters for years cause they know it with the only matter being they make more money and they and theirs is safe.</p>
