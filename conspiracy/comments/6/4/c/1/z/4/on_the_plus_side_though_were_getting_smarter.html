    <div class="md"><p>Violence is being perpetrated on all of us in many forms while the ultra elite sit back and wall themselves off behind militarized police, etc.  The woman who has to work 3 and 4 jobs instead of taking care of her kids properly are experiencing a form of violence that didn&#39;t exist in the past.  The wealth has become more and more concentrated, so that almost no one can work and earn a decent wage unless they are very fortunate, and also must piss in a bottle, have a good credit score, etc.  I haven&#39;t even mentioned the violence on other people in other lands that feeds the greed at the top.  </p>

<p>It&#39;s time to stop being so passive.  Holding signs and chanting is MLK&#39;s way, Gandhi&#39;s way, but both were killed for it.  All of the real heroes of the people die like that, don&#39;t they?  It&#39;s because we allow the evil to exist, and have been taught since birth that that is the only way.  What if it isn&#39;t?  If the masters of deception, the real string pullers paid a heavy price like they did in the French revolution, I doubt we&#39;d live in a world like we do today.  over 200 years later, the French still enjoy many more freedoms (excellent, free health care, long vacations, etc) and a better system for the little guy.</p>

<p>I fully understand your feelings, but let&#39;s not forget the triumphs of Gandhi and MLK.</p>

<p>Their tactics worked. Why trivialize them? They didn&#39;t just &quot;hold signs.&quot; It was tactical and complex opposition. We have no modern equivalent.</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t, but I said they paid with their lives while the Kissinger&#39;s, the Rockefeller&#39;s, the many, many oligarchs are long lived and continue their pillage.  Kissinger is still highly influencing the new world order to this fucking day.  Why should we as a society allow the dung to rule, while the good is murdered and forgotten?  Why should we passively accept this?  Why is evil stronger than good?</p>

<p>The French do indeed have a more egalitarian system, and lead generally much happier lives even all this time later because the oligarchs got their heads chopped off.  The oligarchs are still frightened to this day of the people, it still reverberates through society.  In fact, some were kidnapped and held until demands were met recently, and guess what, it worked. <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-01-07/in-france-kidnapping-the-boss-usually-pays-off">https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-01-07/in-france-kidnapping-the-boss-usually-pays-off</a></p>

<p>From your link:</p>

<p>&quot;In still another case—among a spate of 10 French “bossnappings” in 2009—the manager of a 3M factory in the town of Pithiviers was taken hostage in a dispute over severance pay. The workers served him a takeout meal of mussels and French fries before deciding to let him go and pursue their grievances in court. An appeals court ruled in their favor last July, ordering 3M to pay €800,000 to 110 laid-off workers.&quot;</p>

<p>That would never happen, you&#39;re right, because we are cowed and passive.  Being cowed and passive has gotten us to this extremely screwed up world we see today.  One day soon, because we can&#39;t even peacefully protest without harassment from goose-stepping cowards in tanks at this point on american streets, things are going to explode.  There was a time when the ship could have been righted with a good and healthy purge, but now it&#39;s too late and we are already facing ecological disaster.  When young people really figure out how screwed they are, it&#39;s going to get ugly.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yep.  9/11 didn&#39;t get them in the streets.

<p>&quot;Power concedes nothing without a demand. It never did and it never will. Find out just what any people will quietly submit to and you have found out the exact measure of injustice and wrong which will be imposed upon them, and these will continue till they are resisted with either words or blows, or with both.

<p>But it isn&#39;t up to me.  It&#39;s up to the younger generations to do something now.  I&#39;ve sat back in amazement as college campuses remain quiet, with not even a peep while knowing that they are about to inherit this fucked up world.  The baton needs to be held out to the occupy crowd that did show up in New York, and for some reason hasn&#39;t shown themselves since, except at DAPL.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What you see as &quot;waking up&quot; is actually just a latency in corporate takeover of the internet in my opinion.</p>

<p>We have open and free speech now which allows people to wake up...But just wait until things like google &quot;fact checking&quot; tags, no net neutrality, increased enforcement of piracy, ad revenue revocation, etc take serious hold..We will see the internet turned into the same propaganda machine you see on TV today.
Just wait, ad revenue for the web just overtook TV this year...Those in marketing, advertising, and social control are just getting started on internet manipulation. The bots and shills you see today that are so obvious to spot will become far more convincing and inconspicuous.</p>

<p>This is just a window period, if you see what happened to television/print journalism, the same thing will happen to internet, it is just taking longer as most people in control today aren&#39;t young enough to fully understand the intricacies of the web (we saw how that created a latency in the manipulation political elections--a gap which is now rapidly closing). Once they get the right AI which can handle funneling internet traffic as a whole, you won&#39;t see independent journalism because no one will allow ad revenue to be made from it. </p>

<p>Short of that, politicians who are bought and paid for by these companies will simply pass continual legislation to erode net neutrality, suppress free exchange of ideas on the internet, etc. And those companies (like google, Facebook etc) will simply continue to take market share and bend public consumption of the internet to their will.</p>

<p>Not true: independent journalists today are doing it mostly for love and fresh air. God knows they&#39;re not getting rich off of it. </p>

<p>I think people will just go into specific forums, is all. It&#39;ll create an echo chamber but free thought will prevail. This is what has already happened to me with Reddit: I don&#39;t bother visiting <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a>, <a href="/r/worldnews">/r/worldnews</a>, or anywhere that isn&#39;t this subreddit. If I do, it&#39;s to get a pulse on what the establishment is trying to foist on the mainstream... but otherwise, I see no point. </p>

<p>But places like 4chan, here, Voat... they&#39;ll always exist, even if the name and venue changes. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lol that&#39;s great, but two things:
1) if you don&#39;t see the amount of shilling that goes on in this sub too, this is by no means an open/free community...It&#39;s only because this is a relatively small community, if they wanted to neutralize dissenting opinions on something like this or 4chan, they could do it tomorrow if they cared to.</p>

<p>2) while I agree this is one of the few places you can get actual news, take a look at the average person, they think most of the stories and things here are simply whacky conspiracies. That&#39;s why they haven&#39;t neutralized this information stream yet, they don&#39;t need to. If you try to talk to the average American about JFK, 9/11, etc...They still think you&#39;re crazy and unfortunately that hasn&#39;t changed as much as you think. </p>

<p>Also when I say independent journalism, I mean real journalism, not the stuff people do in their spare time as a hobby. Real independent journalism requires money and resources to actually go investigate stories and cultivate primary sources.
If you look at a website such as wearechange...They are able to physically go investigate things because YouTube ads provide them revenue to do so. When that was revoked, his ability to investigate stories was markedly affected.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s also part of Mass Hysteria. It&#39;s so tricky because I think Trumps tactic is to use paranoia and false awakenings to fuck everyone up. </p>

<p>I think people are more aware but also Trump is not just being literal and obvious. He probably has layers to his plot. He could be trying to scare people that the world is ending. For all we know he has good intentions and all the politicians are working together in some strategy to save the planet from global warming and also start a new form of government. A radical shift. </p>

<p>On the other hand, maybe our country has been compromised already and a tech company went corrupt and is using social engineering to warp all of us into different behaviors. I&#39;m not even sure if we are all exposed to the same stuff anymore. It&#39;s possible that social engineering can be used to divide the world and make people turn against each other. Making them way more susceptible to change. </p>

<p>The idea of our comfort zone or of keeping the status quo was completely demolished by this election. In that sense, trump did something good. </p>

<p>Did you know trump was liberal before the election? Did you know he&#39;s pretty much the most successful businessman on the planet? This makes me think he&#39;s much more clever than simply being literal during the election lol. </p>

<p>I think trump maybe has the goal of using fear and chaos and to present himself as a common enemy. </p>

<p>Maybe Clinton is working with him. Maybe she wanted Syrian war but then trump said no just to get voters. Fear of war and corruption got people to vote for trump. This divided the nation and everyone started domestic chaos because they couldn&#39;t believe anyone voted for trump. The other group of society hated that people judged them for voting for trump. </p>

<p>Now the group who voted because they wanted to avoid a Syrian war just got socially attacked. Now everyone hates trump. Perhaps it&#39;s all part of the plan. Trump also used the &quot;fake news&quot; idea to promote skepticism and make people more psychotic essentially. We found a common enemy now, plus we are more conscious. Radical shifts are going to happen now that we are open to suggestion, a side effect of Mass Hysteria. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have been thinking about this a lot. I know in the past, false flags have been committed by the Us govt to get the people to go along with wars. So that might mean, they really do need a level of public approval even if they do have the upper hand. Why go out of your way to try to Stage something if you don&#39;t have to? </p>

<p>We know they are probably processing all the info on social media to understand further public opinion. My hope is that if we continue to be vocal on social media, help raise awareness, get more people questioning this narrative, and more so, discussing/posting their questioning of the narrative, it might actually have some sway. </p>

<p>It&#39;s just speculation and theory. But I have been thinking about this. Regardless, at the end of the day, something good is likely to result from us talking/posting/discussing this online. It&#39;s better than silence, I suppose. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Me too! I have seen this as well. There is way more questioning of the official narrative here than ever before. The numbers of those questioning are still in the minority obviously, but it&#39;s way more than ever before. </p>

<p>And once people start questioning this, they will likely question more. I can only hope this will continue.</p>

<p>The other good thing here is that so many are discussing this on social media, many questioning it. But it has given great opportunity to bring up past atrocities and bull shit the US has done in the past. I have a few baby boomer family members saying essentially that the US is infallible, always doing good. Then I get to come back with some facts about previous wars, and their tone changes once the realize there was a lot they don&#39;t know here. It&#39;s been a good experience.</p>
