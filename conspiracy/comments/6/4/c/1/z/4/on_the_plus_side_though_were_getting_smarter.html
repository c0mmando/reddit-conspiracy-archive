       I can't tell you what you're seeing. All I can tell you is to pay attention to what you yourself are seeing, and not what you are told you're seeing. Being confused is pretty natural, especially right now. Start trusting yourself. Be open to your understanding of things being challenged, but also be open to becoming your own authority on what you are seeing happen in the world.

       Yes, but the amount of the internet observed by us is pretty small. We can often fall into the trap of saying 'everyone is on the internet and we know internets so we know everyone' - sadly doesn't work that way.

       Sorry, but rejoice?  No one has gone to jail, no one has paid a price for the blood that has been shed since 9/11, the loss of our freedoms, the continuation of wars that have now raged for almost 20 years.  There is nothing to rejoice over.  The american public is as dumb and lazy as ever.  The press lies more than ever.  The centers of power have not yielded anything.  Whistle blowers are mistreated and killed.  I'm not seeing this "gained a lot of ground" that you speak of.  There are dozens of lobbyists for each member of congress.  Here we sit on the edge of yet another war.

       Yes, very true... but we have gained MUCH NEEDED ground and moral authority. It is obvious to everyone we are being duped. This is s process. Granted, it's frustrating how slow things move but that is because of the chilling effect of the NSA, cointelpro, etc.

       Violence is being perpetrated on all of us in many forms while the ultra elite sit back and wall themselves off behind militarized police, etc.  The woman who has to work 3 and 4 jobs instead of taking care of her kids properly are experiencing a form of violence that didn't exist in the past.  The wealth has become more and more concentrated, so that almost no one can work and earn a decent wage unless they are very fortunate, and also must piss in a bottle, have a good credit score, etc.  I haven't even mentioned the violence on other people in other lands that feeds the greed at the top.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's time to stop being so passive.  Holding signs and chanting is MLK's way, Gandhi's way, but both were killed for it.  All of the real heroes of the people die like that, don't they?  It's because we allow the evil to exist, and have been taught since birth that that is the only way.  What if it isn't?  If the masters of deception, the real string pullers paid a heavy price like they did in the French revolution, I doubt we'd live in a world like we do today.  over 200 years later, the French still enjoy many more freedoms (excellent, free health care, long vacations, etc) and a better system for the little guy.

       They are prepared for violence. Hey attempt to provoke it and often fal. That's when they send in the provocateurs to attack and shame a movement.

       I fully understand your feelings, but let's not forget the triumphs of Gandhi and MLK.
      </p>
      <p>
       Their tactics worked. Why trivialize them? They didn't just "hold signs." It was tactical and complex opposition. We have no modern equivalent.

       If you prefer the rhetoric of Malcolm X, George Jackson or Huey Newton, I support that as well.

       I didn't, but I said they paid with their lives while the Kissinger's, the Rockefeller's, the many, many oligarchs are long lived and continue their pillage.  Kissinger is still highly influencing the new world order to this fucking day.  Why should we as a society allow the dung to rule, while the good is murdered and forgotten?  Why should we passively accept this?  Why is evil stronger than good?
      </p>
      <p>
       The French do indeed have a more egalitarian system, and lead generally much happier lives even all this time later because the oligarchs got their heads chopped off.  The oligarchs are still frightened to this day of the people, it still reverberates through society.  In fact, some were kidnapped and held until demands were met recently, and guess what, it worked.

       "In still another case—among a spate of 10 French “bossnappings” in 2009—the manager of a 3M factory in the town of Pithiviers was taken hostage in a dispute over severance pay. The workers served him a takeout meal of mussels and French fries before deciding to let him go and pursue their grievances in court. An appeals court ruled in their favor last July, ordering 3M to pay €800,000 to 110 laid-off workers."

       That would never happen, you're right, because we are cowed and passive.  Being cowed and passive has gotten us to this extremely screwed up world we see today.  One day soon, because we can't even peacefully protest without harassment from goose-stepping cowards in tanks at this point on american streets, things are going to explode.  There was a time when the ship could have been righted with a good and healthy purge, but now it's too late and we are already facing ecological disaster.  When young people really figure out how screwed they are, it's going to get ugly.

       Yep.  9/11 didn't get them in the streets.  The bank bailout, citizen's United, millions losing their homes due to the housing bubbles, endless unnecessary wars, obvious pillaging by the elite, now even the threat of taking away social security.  There is no end to the outrages, and yet, no response.

       There were bulletin boards, mostly local chat rooms, and yes, people did talk on them.  That is almost all they did, and they weren't monitored by the NSA.  So, I'm supposed to be grateful for facebook, smart phones and other social media?  I'm supposed to rejoice over faster communications?  That's what I'm seeing you two talk about like it's a great thing.

       But it isn't up to me.  It's up to the younger generations to do something now.  I've sat back in amazement as college campuses remain quiet, with not even a peep while knowing that they are about to inherit this fucked up world.  The baton needs to be held out to the occupy crowd that did show up in New York, and for some reason hasn't shown themselves since, except at DAPL.

       What you see as "waking up" is actually just a latency in corporate takeover of the internet in my opinion.
      </p>
      <p>
       We have open and free speech now which allows people to wake up...But just wait until things like google "fact checking" tags, no net neutrality, increased enforcement of piracy, ad revenue revocation, etc take serious hold..We will see the internet turned into the same propaganda machine you see on TV today.
Just wait, ad revenue for the web just overtook TV this year...Those in marketing, advertising, and social control are just getting started on internet manipulation. The bots and shills you see today that are so obvious to spot will become far more convincing and inconspicuous.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is just a window period, if you see what happened to television/print journalism, the same thing will happen to internet, it is just taking longer as most people in control today aren't young enough to fully understand the intricacies of the web (we saw how that created a latency in the manipulation political elections--a gap which is now rapidly closing). Once they get the right AI which can handle funneling internet traffic as a whole, you won't see independent journalism because no one will allow ad revenue to be made from it.

       Short of that, politicians who are bought and paid for by these companies will simply pass continual legislation to erode net neutrality, suppress free exchange of ideas on the internet, etc. And those companies (like google, Facebook etc) will simply continue to take market share and bend public consumption of the internet to their will.

      <p>
       If that seems insurmountable, in my opinion, probably just start trying to get everyone you know to experiment with psychedelic drugs, as they have a propensity to expand consciousness in a way which lends itself to innately breaking through all of this corporate brainwashing/media mind control. If you're unfamiliar, I highly encourage it...You'll never look at news, advertisement​s, etc the same again.

       I think people will just go into specific forums, is all. It'll create an echo chamber but free thought will prevail. This is what has already happened to me with Reddit: I don't bother visiting
       <a href="/r/politics">

       ,
       <a href="/r/worldnews">
        /r/worldnews

       , or anywhere that isn't this subreddit. If I do, it's to get a pulse on what the establishment is trying to foist on the mainstream... but otherwise, I see no point.

       Lol that's great, but two things:
1) if you don't see the amount of shilling that goes on in this sub too, this is by no means an open/free community...It's only because this is a relatively small community, if they wanted to neutralize dissenting opinions on something like this or 4chan, they could do it tomorrow if they cared to.
      </p>
      <p>
       2) while I agree this is one of the few places you can get actual news, take a look at the average person, they think most of the stories and things here are simply whacky conspiracies. That's why they haven't neutralized this information stream yet, they don't need to. If you try to talk to the average American about JFK, 9/11, etc...They still think you're crazy and unfortunately that hasn't changed as much as you think.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also when I say independent journalism, I mean real journalism, not the stuff people do in their spare time as a hobby. Real independent journalism requires money and resources to actually go investigate stories and cultivate primary sources.
If you look at a website such as wearechange...They are able to physically go investigate things because YouTube ads provide them revenue to do so. When that was revoked, his ability to investigate stories was markedly affected.

       Depends on where you look. I "like" alot of the veteran meme pages. They usually post stuff making fun of shit you can relate to if you ever "served." Lately though, all these pages are just one big echo chamber circle jerk. Anything short of popular consensus is immediately drowned out

       The biggest issue we all face on this is not enough people are aware of their history. Whats been done to who, how and why things happened. Historical context is really important for understanding the world around us and truly seeing the bigger picture. People are smart but that only goes so far without any background information.

       It's also part of Mass Hysteria. It's so tricky because I think Trumps tactic is to use paranoia and false awakenings to fuck everyone up.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think people are more aware but also Trump is not just being literal and obvious. He probably has layers to his plot. He could be trying to scare people that the world is ending. For all we know he has good intentions and all the politicians are working together in some strategy to save the planet from global warming and also start a new form of government. A radical shift.
      </p>
      <p>
       On the other hand, maybe our country has been compromised already and a tech company went corrupt and is using social engineering to warp all of us into different behaviors. I'm not even sure if we are all exposed to the same stuff anymore. It's possible that social engineering can be used to divide the world and make people turn against each other. Making them way more susceptible to change.
      </p>
      <p>
       The idea of our comfort zone or of keeping the status quo was completely demolished by this election. In that sense, trump did something good.
      </p>
      <p>
       Did you know trump was liberal before the election? Did you know he's pretty much the most successful businessman on the planet? This makes me think he's much more clever than simply being literal during the election lol.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think trump maybe has the goal of using fear and chaos and to present himself as a common enemy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe Clinton is working with him. Maybe she wanted Syrian war but then trump said no just to get voters. Fear of war and corruption got people to vote for trump. This divided the nation and everyone started domestic chaos because they couldn't believe anyone voted for trump. The other group of society hated that people judged them for voting for trump.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now the group who voted because they wanted to avoid a Syrian war just got socially attacked. Now everyone hates trump. Perhaps it's all part of the plan. Trump also used the "fake news" idea to promote skepticism and make people more psychotic essentially. We found a common enemy now, plus we are more conscious. Radical shifts are going to happen now that we are open to suggestion, a side effect of Mass Hysteria.

       From what I can tell most people know they are seeing fuckery, but the truth is still opaque. Moreso, and worse yet, social media has essentially zero power to change policy. Really all that's being generated is agitation.

       I have been thinking about this a lot. I know in the past, false flags have been committed by the Us govt to get the people to go along with wars. So that might mean, they really do need a level of public approval even if they do have the upper hand. Why go out of your way to try to Stage something if you don't have to?
      </p>
      <p>
       We know they are probably processing all the info on social media to understand further public opinion. My hope is that if we continue to be vocal on social media, help raise awareness, get more people questioning this narrative, and more so, discussing/posting their questioning of the narrative, it might actually have some sway.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's just speculation and theory. But I have been thinking about this. Regardless, at the end of the day, something good is likely to result from us talking/posting/discussing this online. It's better than silence, I suppose.

       Me too! I have seen this as well. There is way more questioning of the official narrative here than ever before. The numbers of those questioning are still in the minority obviously, but it's way more than ever before.
      </p>
      <p>
       And once people start questioning this, they will likely question more. I can only hope this will continue.
      </p>
      <p>
       The other good thing here is that so many are discussing this on social media, many questioning it. But it has given great opportunity to bring up past atrocities and bull shit the US has done in the past. I have a few baby boomer family members saying essentially that the US is infallible, always doing good. Then I get to come back with some facts about previous wars, and their tone changes once the realize there was a lot they don't know here. It's been a good experience.

       That would never happen, you're right, because we are cowed and passive.  Being cowed and passive has gotten us to this extremely screwed up world we see today.  One day soon, because we can't even peacefully protest without harassment from goose-stepping cowards in tanks at this point on american streets, things are going to explode.  There was a time when the ship could have been righted with a good and healthy purge, but now it's too late and we are already facing ecological disaster.  When young people really figure out how screwed they are, it's going to get ugly.

       Yep.  9/11 didn't get them in the streets.  The bank bailout, citizen's United, millions losing their homes due to the housing bubbles, endless unnecessary wars, obvious pillaging by the elite, now even the threat of taking away social security.  There is no end to the outrages, and yet, no response.

       Short of that, politicians who are bought and paid for by these companies will simply pass continual legislation to erode net neutrality, suppress free exchange of ideas on the internet, etc. And those companies (like google, Facebook etc) will simply continue to take market share and bend public consumption of the internet to their will.

       If that seems insurmountable, in my opinion, probably just start trying to get everyone you know to experiment with psychedelic drugs, as they have a propensity to expand consciousness in a way which lends itself to innately breaking through all of this corporate brainwashing/media mind control. If you're unfamiliar, I highly encourage it...You'll never look at news, advertisement​s, etc the same again.
