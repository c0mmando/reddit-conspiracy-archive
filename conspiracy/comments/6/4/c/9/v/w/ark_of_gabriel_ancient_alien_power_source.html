        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Reading a post earier about eti and strange radiation emitting from Antarctica. Well somebody had brought up the ark of gabriel being moved there. Im familiar enough with the ark of the covenant in the sense that I was raised (emphasis on raised) roman catholic and as every red blooded american should; seen raiders of the lost ark. So this is a &quot;what if&quot; post. Take it only as seriously as you take yourself. </p>

<p>What if the ark of gabriel is real? What if the reason you cant open it, is because its overflowing with face melting radiation due to a &quot;power cell&quot; or some similar piece of ancient alien technology being stored inside? I cant help but think that if that was the case, and part of the big commotion surrounding Antarctica is being theorized as something relating to eti; then what if the thing in the ice is a ship, or something along those lines, and the power source was brought to it? Could the radiation we are reading about be this? Or some kind of a beacon?</p>

<p>And hey, even if you find it completely outlandish, nothing wrong with getting the ol&#39; creative thinking juices flowing</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sources have been circling around the Kremlin... Anytime I hear that my ears perk up. We&#39;ve never seen this ark. Has anyone heard of it before it was &quot;found&quot;? I can&#39;t seem to find any actual information on it. Socha Faal first broke the story.</p>

<p>With that being said IF it is real. I would say it&#39;s being used to melt the snow/ice because they found someone/something there recently.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Eh yes and no. It is referenced in the bible, and like anything else in the bible (fun fact: alot of the shit we think about the devil is never mentioned in the bible. As far as books go, he really isn&#39;t even in it too much) its open to soooo many interpretations. In it nutshell, all you really get is that this is something of &quot;god&quot; and not meant for us to know its secrets. Indiana jones is the face melting bit. Makes me think of radiation, let alone heat. I suppose my personal opinions that major religion is a means of control, and supposedly the ark has been in the hands of whichever religious group, mixed in with all the strange visits to Antarctica by various interesting people, including religious figures, has me thinking along these lines. </p>

<p>I can see what you are saying about melting the ice. My only hang up on that is on why the ark would melt the ice. I mean i cant i know about Antarctic ice formation, but i would assume it would follow the same principle nature as any form of ice, just super fucking condensed. But if this WAS indeed needed to melt the ice, would it be powering something to generate that kind of heat? Very interesting point</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is no mention of the Ark of Gabriel in the Bible. It is not the same as the Ark of the Covenant. So for the rest of your interpretation on the bible I will not take it. </p>

<p>You&#39;re getting too hung up on the melting of the ice. I just think a lot of energy is being used there and that is why we are seeing the radiation and melting of ice.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay there was a cooler way of going about that. So we can adamantly say that they are two completely different, unknown power storing arks? Im not asking you to &quot;take&quot; anything. I smoked a bowl and want to talk about aliens and conspiracy, thats it.</p>

<p>Oh okay yeah, i see what you are saying. I thought you meant &quot;the ark was needed to melt the ice. So i guess what i am wondering in that sense is, what needs that energy?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry if that was rude. I didn&#39;t mean it. It clearly came off as that. Well, the Ark of the Covenant is fairly well known throughout history. </p>

<p>The Ark of Gabriel is brand new. No one knows anything about it. No mention of it (out in the open anyways). </p>

<p>With all the activity going on in Antartica lately it&#39;s something big. I think they found something really really old and really really powerful.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Straight up; i was just thinking &quot;fuck maybe im just being sensitive to that.&quot; Its all good!</p>

<p>And i AM assuming the two are the same. The very first time i read about the ark of gabriel on here, i went &quot;oh thats another name for the ark of the covenant?&quot;</p>

<p>And yeah, you never hear about the ark of &quot;gabriel&quot;</p>

<p>Yeah. All these readings, visits, and lack of coverage has my gut screaming that this is big</p>

<p>I do think the Ark of the Covenant is a physical object, probably the proof of a female diety. There&#39;s too many references to females, wombs, cups, Goddess, etc in Jewish mysticism and Freemasonry. If Jesus existed, SHE was female. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey, different strokes for different folks. Nothing wrong with opposing opinions, especially on something so speculative. I feel like that, if aliens exists, that that&#39;s assuming a bit too much. We really wouldn&#39;t be able to say what we would see. What does an alien vessel traveling in a means beyond our exact comprehension look like? </p>

<p>If Jesus existed, then jesus was jesus. Are you saying god, if god in the biblical sense, exists then god is female. I mean i guess. Can you really put a gender on something like that though?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Emphasis on was raised. I dont believe in Catholicism. I dont believe in &quot;anything&quot; </p>

<p>Yeah i get where you are coming from. Given the actual factual social power of men throughout known history, the idea that god is woman would cause everyone to take a long hard look at things. To me religion is a tool of control, so of course i could see the scriptures being warped in a lot of ways.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Right. And I believe some of that programming is just about controlling the mind through the body. The stance against abortion isn&#39;t about saving a life, it&#39;s about independent choices and judging the personal morality of individual situations. If you question if your body is your own, then you question who your soul belongs to also.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I like that question, we could get way lost into it. I guess the way i explain to myself what i might think is &quot;that my soul gets lost to the void.&quot; I know its fucking cheesy but it makes sense to me. I think &quot;the void&quot; is nothing and everything at the same time. Like a sort of consciousness that watches history unfold without &quot;your&quot; physical presence. But maybe we get reincarnated. Or maybe it really is nothing, game over, thats it. Thats boring though. Maybe their is a &quot;heaven&quot; or &quot;nirvana&quot; or &quot;shangri la&quot; or any of those things.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah i just saw someone posted this video not to long after i posted this topic. Its interesting. Asks stuff i ask. I dont know about the guardians bit though. I could see more finding some kind of artifact/technology, but an actual living being of this race? And this is totally just me, it just takes a little more suspension of disbelief on my part</p>

<p>Ancient Aliens is hardly a source haha, but this episode talks about the ark as a radioactive machine. It&#39;s fun, not sure how seriously I would take it, but there ya go.</p>
