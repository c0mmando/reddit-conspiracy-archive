       There's 3 separate posts on my front page about how people can't support Trump any more. Can we get back to being critical of all sides again?
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit- are we back to criticizing all sides equally? Incorrect wording I suppose.

       I'm as establishment democrat as they come.  Don't be so quick to announce Trump "alienated his base," it's that condescending attitude that loses elections.  Treat Trump supporters just how you want to be treated.  I'm not going to criticize his actions with Syria today, because I wouldn't have criticized Hillary's.  It's difficult to swallow your pride and criticize the man (or woman) you voted for.

       Yeah I don't get why they think he alienated his base. He blew up an abandoned Air Field and some people are mad at him. They have reason to be upset but it is just a tiny minority and most of them will get over in a few months anyway.

       We have always insisted on and investigated political conspiracies - from JFK to 9/11 to obama &amp; trump. You don't know that because you're concern trolling and/or shilling.

       Trump hasn't alienated his base at all. If anything, dems are turning.

       Dude I've been on this sub for as long as I've been on Reddit, I'm neither concern trolling nor a shill. I had a question, I asked, and the resounding concensus is that I'm wrong. Apparently I put too much emphasis on what I read from his most vocal and long standing supporters. I'm not trying to dictate anything.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I'm guessing you've missed the last year or so where the majority of discussion has been about pizzagate/Hillary vs Trump. And the massive influx of users from the Donald, and how it's taken over discussion....

      <p>
       I've had to actively search for stuff about hollow earth theories and the rainbow city, and evidence of ancient civilizations being far more advanced than were taught.

       I'm not advocating for that, that sounds like hell. I just want a balance of "government corruption" and other shit, that balance has been massively out of whack for a long time, and I incorrectly hoped this could be the start of maybe getting back to a more even balance. Oh well.

       Kind of? They're technically separate, but rainbow city kind of necessitates hollow earth at least being partially true. I'm on mobile so I don't have any of my bookmarked links.

       Rainbow City is based off the report of a US Navy admiral from right after WW2, early 50's iirc. He told a story about a city under the ice of Antarctica inhabited by "genetic super humans" who looked a lot like what the Nazi's described as the Aryan master race. They had flying saucers, super advanced technology, all that fun stuff.

       I think such topics are passing out of interest because the conspiracy community has been smelling blood in the water with America's decline.  There's an opportunity to touch the untouchable that people are reacting strongly to.

       I guess I can agree on smelling blood in the water, depending on how deep your depth of belief goes. If you believe the illuminati/NWO/globalist powers control the world, I don't see how we're nearing the end game personally. If you believe the power conspiracies are limited to people wanting to seize the US or similarly sized regions, then I'd actually agree with you. The end of the US as we know it is likely ending, and perhaps that will give us some new insights to the things going on around us.

       The NWO controls the world, and we
       <em>
        may as well
       </em>
       call them the Illuminati whether or not they call themselves that, but they've made repeated missteps lately.  It's looking like a lot of past world control stories.  The Earth is still a big place, and humans are still an unruly species.  Trying to make sense of all that chaos is hard work.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Illuminati are not capable of the task they've set themselves to.  Resistance is technically unnecessary to their fall; the errors of their pedagogy will do it eventually.  However, the errors of their pedagogy
       <em>
        alone
       </em>
       are likely to still take centuries to unravel, and human progress will be impeded in the meanwhile if we don't oust them.

       Never underestimate the power of the sycophant.

       I personally criticized Obama sometimes. I am in favor of using a drone army to fight our wars but hitting civilian targets is tough to stomach but it happens. At least we're not killing them like the dark ages where armies rampaged through cities raping and stabbing people leaving them to bleed out and die. We'll leave that fucked up shit for ISIS. So I'm not gonna criticize Trump on these military matters because no president is going to get all of our assets out and bring them home like I would want. If Obama couldn't do it, I seriously didn't think Trump would either when he promised.  I just think it's hilarious to see those tweets he sent out in 2013 then lied again.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know about the future here in conspiracy. Seems natural that eventually it will turn into only conspiracies against the current president. I would have thought maybe Trump was a conspiracy theorist and look into assassinations/9-11 and tell us the truth. I'm not gonna hold my breath.
      </p>
      <p>
       With how Trump is shaking out and his reported debts. Something tells me the central banks made a good offer.
