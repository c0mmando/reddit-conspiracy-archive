       It's not a conspiracy that the general masses upvote posts that are simple and pander to obvious shared feelings. And that phenomena is not unique to
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy

       either. If it takes a small amount of thinking to process and confirms your bias/agrees with how you think, it's gonna get upvotes

       This happened once Pizzagate got up and running, winding personal posts about how frightened and disgusted the user had become after learning of all these devious activities. This was back when Pizzagate was purely based on the misdirected "evidence" and "secret codes" and such, when it was Podesta-Clinton-Alefantis-"Spirit Cooking" exclusively. These posts felt propagandistic and like they were intended to induce real panic in the reader.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe they were legit fears that were being dug up in people, but these might have been the effects of the pointed propaganda that Pizzagate itself was.

       Yes, as would be expected, this sub questions authority so shills and bots will constantly attack it with shitposts: I have seen three 'i met a flat earther' posts ont he front page already and here is a reminder:
      </p>
      <p>
       It more the case when the government is starting to be scrutinised over its shadyness and lies, they release into the public crazy propaganda conspiracy theories and then call them out. Making The people who question the "official" narrative seem like conspiratards and conversely lowering the public disobedience towards choices made by those in 'charge'. This time its the war in Syria, America and RUssia are at war via proxy, and thusly extreme times require extreme measures and lies (USA has lied on so many occasions in the past that it gets away with it because of social manipulation techniques like that).
Especially those conspiracy theories that are wack because we as educated beings can see the bullshit from the trees yet those that the evidence for cannot be easily gotten by us (as primary sources) for our own personal confirmation. (moon landings was a good one for a long time because we could never physically go to the moon, flat earth because we cant physically go to space and take a look for ourselves) but the proof is there in large amounts so it must be crazy to question it. This questioning of authority and questioning the 'proof' is when there is an increase of craziness. Esp on the webs as bots can effortlessly spread these posts across popular sites. Why is it the case now, is because UN and Russia is questioning the 'proof' usa has and had for it to do the things it did. Yet the proof that USA is unwilling to share (which in a diplomatic and wartime diplomacy is a dangerous and questionable game to play).
All this is more present in the western world.Flat earthers and UFO sightings are numerous in USA. (UFO best explanation i could think of is, very simple. Most of them rose up it he space race and cold war times. WHen USA and RUssia were experimenting with prototype aircraft and rocket tech. Which need to be tested and some saw it, but in order to try to put a lid on it, its easier to make those who seen something believe in ufos so as to not let secrets spread too fast and out to the enemy hands. As with UFO sightings once an idea is formed it takes on its own identity. Grows out of control like wildfire, after all humans are inquisitive imaginative creatures, and we are full of biases. Plenty of psychological evidence out there for false testimonials contrary to the facts by people who want to believe (like the loch ness monster sightings).
And with talk of election rigging, trump trumping on people's liberties, war in syria, pizzagate, the list goes on. We will see an increase in these crazy conspiracy theories in an attempt to discredit the voices of skeptics by labelling everyone as a conspiracy theorist (associated with crazy theories). What doesnt help is mentally unstable and uneducated people fall victim to believing some of of these through pseudo science (like the atheism vs religion arguments, ancient aliens seen on history channel, videos on youtube etc. That prey on grey areas and pseudoscience.

       Did you notice that op on that topic, u/FUCK_TPTB, is less than a month old? The comment history makes me think it's probably a sockpuppet too even if the name and age didn't.

      <p>
       Anyway, you're spot on. There is definitely vote manipulation being used on this sub. And sometimes, this vote manipulation is used to drive negative posts with no content like that to the top. Anyone who would deny that vote manipulation is a problem here is a liar or a fool.
