       I have a hunch that Trump's people are being removed from their positions and replaced with people aligned with "The Fellowship Foundation" aka. "The Christian Mafia"
      </p>
      <p>
       A good example of this is General McMaster taking over and running the National Security Council.  I would like to find more examples of this to see how much my theory holds up.  My initial attempts at looking into this have been difficult due to the oversaturation of Trump administration news online.

       Edit:
      </p>
      <p>
       Here are some links for people unfamiliar with this organization, which already has heavy representation in the White House (Pence, Devos, Sessions, Carson, McMaster, +)

       When people started being fired and removed I started thinking that Trump probably didn't appoint his choice people to start off with for a reason. I thought that it is not surprising that there is an attack on the "first string" and that they are likely not the intended holders of their positions. I don't know anything about the Christian Mafia but I do know that there are more than one faction of Elite vying for power in this world. It is so easy for people to blame the Jews, the Communists, Islam, or Russia etc as the bad guy but it is very naive to think that even within those factions there is not dissent.

       Every President since Eisenhower speaks at their National Prayer Breakfast event and many people think it's a government function, unaware of who is behind it.  I don't believe the Amish or any group among them has that kind of political power.
