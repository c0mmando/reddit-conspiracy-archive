       I fully believe, that 9/11 was a inside Job. When I hear, that many people still don't believe it, I wonder which Facts they have, that it wasn't a inside job, which have not already been disproved.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also here in Austria, many People believe, that it was an inside job, but a lot are against this theory too, so I want to know, which facts they have, when it comes to a discussion.

       Well first of all despite what many would have you believe it
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       physically possible once you account for all of the variables.
      </p>
      <p>
       The beams don't have to melt to be weakened, and I've yet to see any proof that the "molten steel" at the ground was any of the steel from the beams. For all we know it could've been from a supply closet where loads of staples melted.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's also the fact that the buildings was designed for vertical weight - not horizontal impact - and therefore the entire structure was compromised as soon as it was hit. The third tower was also hit at an odd angle by the falling tower, which was extremely heavy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Onto who crashed the planes?
      </p>
      <p>
       We all know that the majority of the hijackers were Saudis. There are many wealthy Saudis who could have funded this. Keep in mind SA was against Hussein's takeover of Kuwait before the first Gulf War, and were offered military services by bin Laden and his militia. Many felt this was the right way to go, but ultimately they were given a far better option of a half million troops from the US in return for oil. That didn't sit well with the entirety of the higher-ups in SA, and you can't rule out a sect going rogue and attacking the US.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bottom line - I actually believe the official narrative on this one. I know that's unpopular, especially here, but it actually to me makes more sense than many theories that I've seen written about.

       I don't think they have any particular facts other than the facts they were given in the days surrounding the attacks. That's where most people stopped. I know I did until I stumbled across some weird video and I realized I never questioned it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Seeing the two towers fall like that from impacts and fire doesn't make any sense. There seems to be a connection between the idea that a plane hit the building and they way it collapsed that makes people believe it. If you take the plane out and just picture it as a bomb that went off in the same place I don't think anyone would have expected it to fall that way. It's like the planes+total collapse=what we would expect in an action movie so it must be true.

       i can't accept the US government being smart and savvy enough to pull something like that off without more people leaking evidence.   Snowden walked out the front door of the NSA with the "keys to the kingdom" to our latest and greatest spying tech.   Or current white house has more leaks then a polish submarine.  My own experience working in a federal job and serving in the military had shown me how incredibly difficult managing a giant beauracracy is.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the army we called it "Man on the moon syndrome".  Every country we were deployed in held the common belief that we could solve all their problems we just don't want to.   If we could put a man on the moon we can do anything.   The truth is we just arent that good at "Nation Building".
      </p>
      <p>
       I still believe in some conspiracies but these massive ones that require large scale coordination and silence from thousands of people area always a stretch for me.

       Some people here would say all these leaks are planned. The government just makes itself look inefficient on purpose to make people doubt the possibility of pulling off a 9/11.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't agree with them, but you can't reason with them. They just think you're a government agent here to distract them from the truth.

       Ok, I hear this one a lot. It's based on a false premise though.
      </p>
      <p>
       1) it wouldn't take very many people to pull off. Every job is based on time, not man power.
      </p>
      <p>
       2) those involved would be compartmentalized.
      </p>
      <p>
       3) you are assuming that US contractors would be utilized to carry out the attack and therefore be able to leak information.
      </p>
      <p>
       4) repurcussions for breaking silence is always a factor, and if YOU were putting together a top secret operation, would you pick people who display the psychological markers for leaking information?
      </p>
      <p>
       5) when leakers present themselves, they are labelled liars, charlatans, or wackos.... you wouldn't even listen due to your preconceived bias on the subject, so how would you know?

       So basically it woukd require a Shadow Government that regular government employees are not aware of.  Would that include the President and member of his staff?  Would future Presidents be aware or would they just be puppets kept in the dark?
      </p>
      <p>
       Im not trying to be condisending but i just have trouble believing how small you could keep the circle of people in the know.  Someone had to manage getting the planes (different ones or thr ones that took off from their respective airports?).  The air traffic controllers, the passengers, the captains and flight crew, body disposal if the passangers werent on the plane.  Are we faking air traffic controller data?
      </p>
      <p>
       Leakers are definately gonna face scepticism regrdless of what their leaking or who its from.  Snowden came prepared and walked away with all the evidence needed to bring the scope of NSA spying capabilities to light.  Its unfortunately expected that leakers have a high standard of evidence to present or else they get ignored.
      </p>
      <p>
       If any of the leakers you mentioned were legit, i assume the people behind 9/11 would have had them killed as well.  What difference would a few more bodies make?
      </p>
      <p>
       The end goal is also a little murky for me.  The military industrial complex doesnt really need to commit somerhing like that for congress to suck their dick, its already par for the course.

       All it would really take is a handfull of high ranking officials, the buildings owner, and a small demo crew (military contractors could handle this).
      </p>
      <p>
       As far as air traffic controllers, no.. no need to include them. There were so many funky things going on in this arena, I won't even attempt speculation. It would take me hours to disseminate all the strange. Look it up. Some think there were no planes at all, some think they were switched in air, some think they were just drones. I focus more on the holes than making up an alternative timeline.

       Killing senators and governors that performed the official investigation, after they've come out discrediting their own investigation would probably raise more eyebrows than just drowning them out, don't you think?

       The end goals were pretty obvious imo. Finalizing a war started by the former Bush, insurance money, oil, poppy fields, public approval, and of course pushing the "patriot act" through.

       If that.  It could be pulled off with only 3-5 people actually in the know if they include (likely) Dick Cheney and any intelligence heads.  Everything else would go through our vast channels of compartmentalized action.  And you don't get to the top of the CIA, FBI or any other covert military program if there is
       <em>
        any
       </em>
       chance you will leak or have a crisis of conscience.

       The fact that no plane hit the Pentagon/not one picture or video evidence is just stupid. Another stupid part of the official story is the terrorist passport that was supposedly found on the street even though we are told to believe the jet fuel exploded and burned hot enough to take down the twin towers.

      </p>
      <p>
       "FACT: Once each tower began to collapse, the weight of all the floors above the collapsed zone bore down with pulverizing force on the highest intact floor. Unable to absorb the massive energy, that floor would fail, transmitting the forces to the floor below, allowing the collapse to progress downward through the building in a chain reaction. Engineers call the process "pancaking," and it does not require an explosion to begin, according to David Biggs, a structural engineer at Ryan-Biggs Associates and a member of the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) team that worked on the FEMA report."

       They cover some of the major conspiracies surrounding the towers and
       <em>
        how
       </em>
       they fell but they missed a lot. In my opinion, even if the towers did come down via planes there is still a bunch of unanswered questions.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example, why didn't they go into the conspiracy claims about:
      </p>
      <p>
       a) NORAD's 80 minute response time (visible in the official commission report)
      </p>
      <p>
       b) The "plane" that hit the Pentagon happened to hit the same office that was investigating trillions in missing money and killed the majority of the analysts working on the case and most of the documents/files.
      </p>
      <p>
       c) The FEMA drills/operation that was slated for that week and why FEMA was already there and set up on Sept 10th prior to the attack.
      </p>
      <p>
       And there are a lot more. We just had two huge posts by users in the last couple weeks with tons of excellent information. I recommend going and reading those.

       None of those things have to do with science or engineering which is what Popular Mechanics covers. I like that they stuck to what they have expertise in.

       Personally, it's the fact that there were so many witnesses and recordings of the Twin Towers collapse that the basic facts are indisputable unless you find me some real damning evidence. The planes crashed into the buildings. The buildings caught fire and the floors where the crash happened began to collapse. The collapse brought down the upper floors which built momentum and crushed everything below them. So far I have yet to find anything convincing enough to tell me that those facts are incorrect. The vast majority of experts in structural engineering, aerospace, demolition, skyscraper architecture, terrorism, and material science agree on what happened with only a vanishing small minority "questioning the official narrative".
      </p>
      <p>
       Sure there have been many people who've claimed smoking guns over the years. But each and every time they are debunked. Then the conspiracy theorists move on to something else and pretend that the first theory was "disinfo". Like how 10 years ago,
       <em>
        Loose Change
       </em>
       was all the rage and made a huge fuss about "jet fuel can't melt steel beams". That was quickly disproven (jet fuel can
       <em>
        weaken
       </em>
       steel beams) only for the theorists to move on to discussions about the collapse into the footprint. Again, this was shown to be fairly basic engineering based on how the Twin Towers were built. Then they moved on to Tower 7. Rinse and repeat. It's very obvious that 9/11 conspiracy theorists aren't people that found the circumstances suspicious and constructed a theory based on the flawed evidence, rather they believe in a theory without evidence then hunt for facts that would fit their theory retroactively.
      </p>
      <p>
       Finally the sheer number of people to have been involved would make it nearly impossible to keep silent for this long about things. Even if the act were compartmentalized, each compartment would certainly know that
       <em>
        something
       </em>
       was up and after 16 years there's no way all of them would have been totally deathly silent on it.

       Your assesment and generalization of 9/11 conspiracy theorists is more telling of your worldview than anyone elses.
      </p>
      <p>
       My path to realization had more to do with my interests in becoming a demolitionist at the time and then the official explanation. You can just continue turning thermal dynamics on it's head in order to perpetuate your confirmation bias though.

       Yes, it is. That's exactly what generalizing is. YOU see a pattern (whether the pattern is true or not) based on YOUR limited experience and proceed to characterise an entire group based off of YOUR perceptions of a small but loud minority within the group.
      </p>

       Has it occurred to you that adding false details to the theories would be in the best interests of those wishing for factual details to be hidden? If someone is leaking your closely gaurded secret to your friends and they approach you about it, the best response to diffuse interest is to admit to the deeds in a sarcastic way and add an utterly unbelievable false fact on at the end.

       I have just as much experience in assessing 9/11 conspiracies as everyone else on here. The difference is that I looked at the evidence of a conspiracy with a critical eye and no preconcieved opinions one way or another. As I've stated, virtually every theory starts with the assumption that the "official story" is false, and tries to cherry pick pieces of evidence that fit that theory. That's the generalization if you want to call it that and it's absolutely true.

       You're making assumptions about the capabilities of others and equating yourself to the highest levels of those capabilities. How very conceited of you.

       Everyones experience is limited btw, so if that's what you're taking issue with, don't.

       No proper theories start under the preconceived notion that the official story is false either. You are very late in the game if that's your perception. The best way to come at the idea is just to expose the holes by use of math and science like

       All have to say in response to that is that the overwhelming vast majority of people with the capabilities and knowledge to investigate the topic have confirmed that two planes took down the Twin Towers and several surrounding buildings while a third crashed into the Pentagon and a fourth was downed by passengers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Using my own critical thinking skills, I read the evidence presented by
       <em>
        Loose Change
       </em>
       , AE911Truth, and other such groups and websites and it only served to ground my original convictions. Occasionally I actually do see or hear of something that sounds like it may be convincing (the passport that survived the fire, the lack of Pentagon video, the melted steel) but over all they were tiny inconsistencies in an otherwise straightforward story.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I don't trust those organizations. AE911Truth for instance has been shown to not check as to who they consider an architect or engineer so any idiot can just sign on. Their number one paper was self-published, not peer reviewed, and listed about 10 authors the majority of which had no architecture or engineering credentials.

       You can't make exceptions for "minor" inconsistencies in physics or demolitions. If "minor" inconsistencies are present, it's a complete failure. You like absolutes, you should understand this. Thermodynamics doesn't allow for the events of that day. The manner in which the buildings fell and the flight manuevers and speed give away the lie. All of the other "minor" inconsistencies (read as physical impossibilities) are just more evidence against the official theory.
      </p>
      <p>
       Speaking of theories, how do you like knowing that you subscribe to the pancake theory? It's completely unreplicatable in reality. People are risking their names and careers by calling out the inconsistencies while the investigators of the official theory won't even stand by their own work. Let that sink in.

       I'm glad you mentioned that statement, it's a great example of another bit of criticism on 9/11 conspiracies. What the speaker was saying was that the whole commission was under such heavy scrutiny and so pointlessly politicized that it hindered them unnecessarily and prevented them from finding out some important
       <strong>
        details
       </strong>
       . Note the word
       <strong>
        details
       </strong>
       , because at no point did anyone on the Commission deny that the buildings collapsed due to planes flying into them, or claim that there were explosives in the buildings. In fact, they are all pretty firm that that's exactly what did happen, but were disappointed that they couldn't find out some of the smaller
       <strong>
        details
       </strong>
       like a better timeline for the terrorists's lives, or more evidence against Al Qaeda.

      <p>
       It's not a minor inconsistency in the physics, it's a minor inconsistency on the exact manner in which the building fell. Perhaps the planes knocked out crucial supporting beams. Perhaps the jet fuel burned away the exterior before the interior. Perhaps the planes began their decent earlier. Again, the smaller details as to what happened don't match up exactly with what is believed to have happened, but they certainly aren't big enough to even reconsider the narrative.

        NIST disagreed

       and settled on a very similar but different theory.

       It's major flaws in the physics. For the same reasons that they teach in demolitions, buildings don't fall in on themselves by accident. It takes a very specific chain of events. Anything else would have a different result. WTC7 is the best example.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would be extremely interested to see the models that your math is based off of. We might be able to save time and money by just flying planes into buildings or soaking them with kerosene. I'm pretty sure those models aren't publicly available for whatever reason though.
      </p>
      <p>
       On the other hand, we do have 2 computer models from UAF that show a 0% chance of 7 collapsing in such a fashion.

       The models were the ones developed by NIST, discussed on the site I linked you. They show the buildings (the Twin Towers and WTC 7) collapsing in the manner described, with a few minor caveats. There were many other models drawn up over the years that show different ways in which the collapse could have happened, since no one can possibly know for sure. Cherry picking the one or two flawed models out of dozens of accurate ones is simply dishonest.

       Some of those experts are working on the UAF models.. they are also open to input from the public. If the models are actually flawed then those other experts are fully able to point out and correct the flaws, but haven't.

       Right, so there's no point in talking about UAF until they release the findings in September.

       So what we have now is a massively large panel of experts who examined the evidence on one side, and a small handful of experts mixed in with "truth seekers" on the other side that have yet to sufficiently prove any of their major points.
