       Run away as fast as possible and have nothing to do with the protest, because it has been infiltrated by the establishment on both sides (Left and Right) in order to paint opposition and dissendents as white supremacists and nazis.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you stay in the protest, you are cooperating with them and are playing in their strings. Do not cooperate. They are attempting a coup via multiple related incidents.

       Am I doing nothing? I don't think so. I don't need or want to be a leader or a hero  or a Messiah. I don't want to change the world. Don't get me wrong, I'd love to see the world change, but I'm not the man to do it. I'm satisfied with making my community a better place. I think too many of us feel that doing a little is not enough, but doing a little is actually more than enough, and if everyone contributed a little, life would be utopian in nature.

       This isn't a war, and I would greatly enjoy avoiding a war.
      </p>
      <p>
       Our government has us in one for nearly 18 years, and apparently the rhetoric seems to drift towards warring tactics, and if you aren't fighting on the streets, you're a coward.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is regressive thinking. We know who the enemy is, and it isn't poor Hispanics, poor blacks, poor whites. In fact, the color doesn't really matter. It's the amount of Cash and influence they have, and most poor people don't have that.

       I only use literary quotes on social media to express my opinions because I have low self-esteem and don't want to isolate my friends. I'm too friendly in real life to cause the derision.
      </p>
      <p>
       I only really use Reddit to get into the meat and potatoes of issues anyway because I have no qualms talking with random strangers about the issues. Although there is no possible way for an upward punch to the elites from here.
      </p>

       I'm not scared, just always wary of my internet thumbprint and the fact that it doesn't take much anymore to do someone and ruin their career :)

       Given that contradictive isn't a word, I'd say you set yourself up for failure. I agree, opinions are meaningless, that's why I create change through action. Unfortunately, opinion seems to be all you have to offer, and it's a shitty opinion to boot.

       That was overly cryptic, but I'll make one last push to end this with some positivity. If you would stop assuming everything you think you know about me and simply ask what I mean when I say something we could avoid this whole negative feedback loop. I work in home construction/remodel. I
       <em>
        literally
       </em>
       build better lives for people. I volunteer with groups like Habitat for Humanity and Loaves &amp; Fishes. I give rides to hitch hikers, food to homeless people, and help to those who ask. I do this because this is the change I wish to see in the world. Now that I have "made my actions clear", none of this is contrary to what I have stated prior, nor does it require me to go toe to toe with militant mobs, so I do not see where your point is made.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know your actions because you have made no attempt to share, only criticised me. If you can explain to me where my faulty reasoning is, I'd be happy to hear it.

       Well at least we have an open dialogue going now. Yes I am a glorified construction worker, and when I was just a laborer I still felt the same way. You fix cars? You're what keeps people's world going dude. 
You got me on world changing thing. I guess a more accurate way of putting it is I don't care to change others to fit my worldview.

       Same thing goes with the Antifa nutcases.  The political party nonsense makes each person on each side believe there are millions of each and that we are at war with each other.

       There are definitely a lot more Antifa and Antifa sympathizers though, when compared to any of the groups they claim to be against. Mostly just kids and angry 20-somethings who think it's cool... but they managed to get ~40,000 people in Boston to protest against free speech.

       When I saw hundreds marching lockstep by torchlight chanting actual nazi slogans, I'm inclined to believe they were nazis. That seems reasonable to me. Looking at a disparate group of protesters and declaring them all to one group, when other groups had permits seems like an attempt to declare two things the same that aren't.

Any input is useful as I'm far removed from proceedings and the accompanying water cooler conversations

       No worries. I believe the video of the night before speaks for itself. That wasn't about a monument. It was about hating Jews and chanting nazi slogans.

       If you saw a bunch of people marching with torches and chanting Nazi slogans to protest the removal of confederate symbols, but were "unable to reach a clear conclusion", then you might want to interrogate where that lack of clarity stems from.

       If even a tenth of a percent of those 40k were Antifa (and I'd be willing to bet much more were) then they still outnumbered those Neo Nazi/KKK at Charlottesville. Really puts the MSM narrative into perspective.

       A tenth of a percent of 40k is 40 people. There were several hundred at Charlottesville. That doesn't much matter though. And yes, it turns out that there are far more people that don't approve of Charlottesville than do.

       Ah yes, that makes it much clearer. The counter-protesters who showed up weren't actually capable of making the decision to protest on their own. They needed antifa and antifa sympathizers to convince them. Thanks for clearing that one up /s

       Clearly you do have a problem with them exercising their right to free speech if you're going to such great lengths to mis-characterize their protests.
      </p>
      <p>
       According to the Boston Police Department, there were only 33 people arrested out of roughly 40,000 people. Just in case you don't feel like doing math, that's 0.08% of the people. In other words, 99.92% were law abiding protesters exercising their right to free speech.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yet here you  are calling them animals and trying to misrepresent their protests for what they were. Your agenda is becoming clearer with every additional post you make.

       Please allow me to resolve this little logical conundrum for you. Spoiler alert: you are in the wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="/u/SomeoneLikeYouToo">
        /u/SomeoneLikeYouToo

       thought it was absurd for people to go to a Donald Trump rally in Boston to protest the actions of neo-nazis in Charlottesville. You later relevantly pointed out that overlapping speaker engagements made this less absurd, frankly winning the real debate over this point right there! However, I am a stickler for cold, dry logic, so your win will unfortunately not come into play in this analysis. Instead we must restrict ourselves to the premises that were at hand when you leveraged your inadequate accusation of the "non-sequitur" fallacy.
      </p>
      <p>
       So,
       <a href="/u/SomeoneLikeYouToo">
        /u/SomeoneLikeYouToo
       </a>
       thought the premise for the demonstration was absurd. To illustrate
       <em>
        why
       </em>
       he thought it absurd, he constructed a parallel example that demonstrated the same error of logic that he thought could be seen in the Boston demonstration. The strategy being, if you could be made to agree that the parallel example contained obviously inconsistent logic, then it would follow that the argument for the Boston demonstration would be inconsistent as well if it followed the same inconsistent logic.
      </p>
      <p>
       To this, you replied "non-sequitur", as if by pointing out that
       <a href="/u/SomeoneLikeYouToo">
        /u/SomeoneLikeYouToo

       's parallel example contained inconsistencies, you were thereby able to disqualify it as the starting point of a logical debate.
      </p>
      <p>
       But those logical inconsistencies were the
       <em>
        point
       </em>
       of
       <a href="/u/SomeoneLikeYouToo">
        /u/SomeoneLikeYouToo
       </a>
       's example, and by agreeing that it is indeed ridiculous you have in fact agreed that the Boston demonstrators were equally ridiculous in their motivations - unless you can show that the two cases don't share the faulty logic! Which it turned out you could, with the speaker list argument, but alas that was too late with respects to your faulty usage of "non-sequitur".

        According to the Boston Police Department, there were only 33 people arrested out of roughly 40,000 people. Just in case you don't feel like doing math, that's 0.08% of the people. In other words, 99.92% were law abiding protesters exercising their right to free speech.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Because everyone who commits a crime gets arrested. 100% of the time. Nobody gets away with anything, and having a large group of people to cover you and protect you from cops means nothing. Give me a break...

       Yes, you're right. Free speech actually does "butter my bread". What do you do for a living? Stock shelves at the local gas station? You better hope that pays more than I think it does, and you never need to speak or write something that masked mobs of thugs disagree with.

       In the Portland free speech rally protest there was a few hundred Antifa. Maybe close to five hundred. And that wasn't even a big event with a lot of press coverage, although it did garner more attention because DHS came in because the rally was held in a federal park. That and the mayor tried to cancel it even though it falls out of his jurisdiction, lol.
      </p>
      <p>
       I realize there aren't "millions" of Antifa, but there's definitely quite a lot considering how far-left they are on the spectrum. Look at Berkeley, there was a shit ton of them there.

       Is anyone who advocates free speech and slightly right leaning a Nazi to you?
      </p>
      <p>
       If that's the definition then it's easy for those guys to make that decision, but having any sort of empathy to realize that there are incredibly dumb southerns who aren't racist and are terrible at expressing their frustrations with the current administration and political fervor that still surrounds it. They go to work, they go home, and then they watch the news. They get the fox scoop, and others get the MSNBC scoop and they are just absolutely crushed to watch literal Nazis and Stalinist march on their streets as if they are the only two movements in existence to represent the right and left.
      </p>
      <p>
       So they decide to protest to protect a Confederate monument, because they don't see the point in it. It's a state decision, is it not?
      </p>
      <p>
       This is why I'm so determined to figure out who is actually a Nazi, before forcing myself to be facetious enough to encourage violence.

       That's exactly my point. They are agent provocateurs trying to radiacalize the protest. The other side is the Antifa "Ninjas", and both are controlled by the same source.

       Maybe you missed this part
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        They are agent provocateurs
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       That statement answers your question. Why would they do it? Because
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agent_provocateur">
        those two words literally mean something
       </a>
       . They describe a type of person/people who "play act" in order to achieve an end result on society.
      </p>
      <p>
       They exist. There is historical precedent to believe these exist, and a government that literally prints their own money has plenty of capital to pay people to fill these roles. The FBI/CIA/3-letter alphabet agencies have a long history of infiltrating groups by pretending to be apart of them. There is a lot of past evidence to believe that not only has this happened in the past, it never really stopped happening.
      </p>
      <p>
       So the answer of "why would they risk it?" is because they're being paid and they thing they're serving whatever group they work for(both government and private such as masons, church of satan etc)

       This is how you embolden them, everytime we put Spencer or David Duke on the news it emboldens them. The only reason they crawled out from whatever punkrock, white trash, doc Martin booted hole is because of this apparent 'whitelash' the media spoke about, it gave them a fucking cause and something to fight for.

       I think he knows Nazis are real, we've all seen American History X.

       Where he is drawing his line is that both groups are being funded by some section of the elite, and he believes there is elements of grassroots organization (I know everyone of you protestors 'work' super hard) but is ultimately being directed to certain cities and places that they can whip up racial anger, they tried it in my state but it failed (which is why no one has heard about that protest here.

       Good advice, not an entirely accurate argument. This divide is overwhelmingly fabricated but there are still legitimate radicals on both sides. In any case, the point has been made. We understand what's going on. Now, let's actually figure out how to take advantage of it. That's the only logical step going forward.

       Exactly, but I don't look it as bad necessarily. Look at Boston for example. 40,000 people showed up to take on what, 50 people huddled in a gazebo? That's an immense show of force regardless of how it came to be. That kind of force is needed in the war against the real enemies. So, we try shifting the narrative ever so slightly and get this anger back on track. 40,000 people in New York City locking down Wall Street sounds like my kind of game. We just need that same anger and desperation.

       There's no question they're gleaming at us fighting each other. No matter what action is taken, infiltration is inevitable. There's no stopping it, but we could use it to our advantage as well.

       Even the obvious agitation tactics don't turn off enough people to totally derail a movement, so baiting the state to strike first could turn the tide just enough.

       I have met genuine neo-nazis. I shared a house with one for three years. I've met his friends - they protested, they marched, they attended "rock against communism" events, they harassed brown and queer people in the streets. I'm reasonably confident that none of them were getting fat shill bucks from the "Feds".

       There's a history of using controversial symbols as a message of anti-authoritarianism even without directly supporting the "intended" message of that symbol. In the early days of punk, for example, swastikas were sometimes "appropriated"-- not because the punks were Nazis necessarily, but because they wanted to be shocking and controversial. When you were younger, you probably knew people who would draw pentagrams despite not actually being satanists. Similar idea.
      </p>
      <p>
       There have also been efforts to "take back" the swastika. Before the Nazis, it used to be a symbol for Buddhism. Even today some east Asian cultures still use it in non-Nazi contexts. For example, a Pokemon card released in Japan has one on it and the US release of the card had to change it. I've seen it suggested that we should use the swastika in non-Nazi ways like that to blunt the offensiveness of the image, but doing this would just result in people thinking you're a Nazi anyway.

       My issue with your statement is my issue with this sub.
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        Every
       </em>
       time a horrible incident occurs you can count on
       <em>
        someone
       </em>
       here to have a theory as to why it was fake, a false flag, etc. And for the most part, that's fine, because after all this is
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       My point is that real attacks/incidents occur. Therefore, if some incidents are real, and every incident is portrayed as being fake, then we're ignoring some real attacks (Sandy Hook, anyone?).
      </p>
      <p>
       The same argument applies here. You aren't even saying "most", you just flat out say if anyone protests with flags or uniforms then it's clearly fake.
      </p>
      <p>
       You realize there are dumbasses on the right and the left? And you realize these dumbasses will protest?

       Even if a 100% real Nazi waves a Nazi flag, and it's definitely not a fake, the end result in public opinion is the same. I think the point op was trying to make is that you should basically assume they're acting in bad faith, because even if they're being honest, they're still acting in bad faith.

       I'm fairly confident there are paid agitators and/or plants on both sides of every single one of these protests.

      <p>
       The media loves to paint any and all protestors as bad. Think about that.

       There is a lot of proof that organizations use agents provacateur to cause trouble. It's an established practice that's been known of for decades.

       Yes, but both of these groups are a small minority that not a lot of people care about, well except the Nazis. The average American isn't scared of Antifa, so why would organizations pay actors to join a group not many Americans think about?

       No worries. I believe the video of the night before speaks for itself. That wasn't about a monument. It was about hating Jews and chanting nazi slogans.

       If you saw a bunch of people marching with torches and chanting Nazi slogans to protest the removal of confederate symbols, but were "unable to reach a clear conclusion", then you might want to interrogate where that lack of clarity stems from.
