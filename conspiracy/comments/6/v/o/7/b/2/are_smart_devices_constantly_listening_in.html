       I have heard and speculated that smart devices such as phones eavesdrop on people and create their Internet ads and searches to be geared towards it, or worse.
      </p>
      <p>
       Example: yesterday my sisters friend stopped by and somehow we got on the topic of ice trays. He mentions how his girlfriend bought a silicone ice cube tray, etc, and I say that I don't even own one tray.
      </p>
      <p>
       Today my Internet ad suggestions shows images of three separate silicone ice cube trays that are on sale or whatever. I've never typed or searched for ice cube trays in my life. I wasnt on my phone during this stupid conversation either. How is this just a coincidence?
      </p>
      <p>
       Apologies if this is not the sub for this type of thing.

       Google and Facebook are listening for sure, for there ad service
      </p>
      <p>
       we need to launch a backlash against the advertisers who ultimately benefit from their "ROI" on targeted advertising.
      </p>
      <p>
       launch a boycott and a social media shit storm against the advertisers.
      </p>
      <p>
       start new hashtags like #HeyFacebook or #OKFacebook to draw attention to the fact that Facebook is listening
      </p>
      <p>
       with just one well-publicized success, we could move the needle on things like Facebook stock, especially with an exodus of their user base to other platforms
      </p>
      <p>
       we could start new hashtags to promote leaving Facebook, and offering "free software foundation" recommended alternatives.

       to expand on this "who is listening":
      </p>
      <p>
       most of the time some form of algorithm, A.I.. Most of the data collected is not of immediate interest and exclusively handled by A.I.. (look up NLP, Natural Language Processing)
      </p>
      <p>
       However, there are some key words and phrases that can trigger an alarm, triggering human supervision and permanent storing of the recordings.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is why a lot of essential and important discussion isn't happening in public places anymore.
      </p>
      <p>
       If someone has the look of "I actually would love to tell you something", but doesn't - it is safe to assume, that he wants to talk about a topic, that would trigger this kind of alarm. (or maybe "just" a paranoid human...)
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       Who is this human, that is handling the supervision, working for? Good question. For the general public? Hard to believe ;)

       many years ago i saw a list of words that trigger alarm bells
      </p>
      <p>
       there was a list of slang words for drugs, and it was very long. i didn't even recognize most of the slang words
      </p>

       suffice it to say, there are no slang words that you can use that are not already known to trigger

       It isn't a coincidence.  They are listening.  We've consented usually to this by giving them access to ourselves or not reading the legalese of service agreements that we accept anyway.

       Fundamental violation of privacy is a red flag that should not be hidden in
       <em>
        fine print

       its not just listening, its logging forever and building profiles on each individual person. Bots are used to search for words both heard over the mic and on your screen by installing a keylogger and silently attacking the screenshot algorithim. Probably everyone you know has keyloggers installed on their phones that were put there by multiple different governments and non-government hackers

       Yes. And if you don't want them to hear your face-to-face conversation, take out your battery. You have to take the battery out.

       Unsettling doesn't cover it. The less ignorant the worse it becomes. Does it make a difference if the phone is dead but the battery is in it?

       That's a good question, that I have yet to test. I will have to test this. However, for me, what happened, was .. I sang a song about pizzagate -- and my phone was off, but the battery was in, and it vibrated (even the it was off.. it had the battery in, and there was still power left).
      </p>
      <p>
       The circumstances of catching the phone on videotape or any other means is very difficult, and I only have one recording of the NSA abusing me in other ways that are even worse

      <p>
       ...I've reached out to the media sources that I want, but they've yet to respond.

       they have an emergency battery i believe but thats just used for geolocation i think. The mandatory IMSI chip is able to be scanned for your geolocation at anytime without any need for a battery. RFID chips are able to be scanned also without any battery, but those are shorter range.

       IMSI is not a chip, it is an identifier and it is stored in your SIM card. It is not a radio, it does not communicate. It is used to identify a device through GSM UMTS network signals.

       really every phone has a battery that cant be removed except flip phones or non-smart phones. Even when its turned off its able to listen and activate various things. Its all in the Terms and Conditions. Read the terms and conditions of any app, device or piece of software. Check out Googles

       I want to challenge people, and maybe start a "thing" to have people put on their favorite movie talking about 9/11 or fracking or weather related whatever and put and leave your phone next to it, listening.  Do that a few times just for funsies.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, if anything give the three letter agencies something to listen to.  If anything its a message right back at them, if you choose to do it, it shows that you're paying attention.  They would like to listen in to your convo's but instead all they get a dose of your fav video.  Like, nothing but AE9/11 truth audio coming back at them?  What would that say to them if enough people did it?

       every phone is a bug
      </p>
      <p>
       they are listening for all kinds of background noises
      </p>
      <p>
       if you flick a lighter, they will suggest a lighter
      </p>
      <p>
       its not "the government" per se, but supposedly private corporations (which are publicly traded on the stock market)
      </p>
      <p>
       so Facebook listens to your background noises, to pitch ads that are relevant to each user.
      </p>
      <p>
       i mention i need laundry soap, i get a coupon for laundry soap as my next youtube ad
      </p>
      <p>
       as the one supposed whistleblower on here, the air force guy,
      </p>
      <p>
       said when he was asked if we are all on lists, he said no its not like that... its much worse
      </p>
      <p>
       i suspect what he meant was that there was not some "master list" of "conspiracy theorists" that you are either on or not on...
      </p>
      <p>
       but rather to say that everyone who has a social security number has a unique number as an identifier, which remains with you regardless if you change your name 5 times.
      </p>
      <p>
       and attached to this social security number is a list of words that describe you.
      </p>
      <p>
       its not "if" you are on a list, but rather "which lists am i on?"
      </p>
      <p>
       so in theory all of this info is in the hands of private corporations, and the private corporations merely comply with court orders (or not) when giving this info to the government
      </p>
      <p>
       combine that with what are called Fusion Centers, and you have local police with NSA level access to your info, for any reason, from stalking an ex-girlfriend, to gang-stalking you as a targeted individual

       I don't have Facebook app or Facebook messenger, no Instagram, snap chat, or any other app. My location has always been turned off, and every privacy setting is supposedly active. I never allowed access to whatever the cloud is from the start, and clicked all the privacy settings.

       I assumed it would typically listen in on people with everything possible downloaded to their phones. Also, I don't have a television that's "connected"; it just is for DVDs, or Internet, just the data that's on the phone.

       Just because you dont allow access doesnt mean anything, there is a chipset in every smartphone called an IMSI and its required to be in there by law in the USA. The IMSI chip tracks geolocation and is tied to the identity of the phone owner.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway unless you have physical hardware switches that turn off your mics, cameras, battery, geolocation tracking chipsets, etc. its gonna be logging everything. Its nothing new, just go over to r/privacy and ask them about some of the stuff or just read some of the posts and articles over there if you want more info with sources.

       Good that I remember a time where making money from websites was a rare thing and people created millions of websites because they had something to share. With no adverts in sight.
      </p>
      <p>
       I completely disagree with aggressive advertising, especially from useless websites, that only exist for greed. 
I love blocking adverts and will do so until they become less annoying. 
They need ME more than I need them, as I am the consumer with the money. Make me happy and I buy your shit. Wind me up and get blocked. Simple as that.

       Audio files are rather large in size. The real question is not weather they're, but do they have the hardware capacity to store it all? Because if they do, you better believe it's stored somewhere.

       many apps and devices are always listening. sometimes you can reduce it, but here's my take:
      </p>
      <p>
       if they're going to listen, i'm going to remind them every day I am waking up, and so are hundreds of millions of others, and there is nothing they can do to stop the inevitable shift to the positive timeline where humanity is finally free

      <p>
       Most of the holders of the patent of a chip that was projected to become quasi ubiquitous in connected devices were aboard Malaysia Airlines MH370 that "disappeared". After their death, freescale semiconductors got back the full ownership of the patent.
      </p>
      <p>
       Who owns freescale (before the merger with NXP at least, I don't know since)? Jacob Rotschild.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe a coincidence, maybe not, personally I'm not taking any chances.

       I've never spoke into my phone or used anything like Siri. I had no idea that was possible. I didn't realize that not having any apps, using privacy settings, and having my phone turned off is completely useless. My phone is like six years old too. Creepy.

       Well Iphone has a feature called "hey Siri" where you can say "hey siri xxx" and it will respond without you pushing a button. How else would it hear you say "Hey Siri" without it constantly listening?

       If you test this theory out yourself with packet analysis software (Wireshark, for example), you'll find that this is not actually the case.
