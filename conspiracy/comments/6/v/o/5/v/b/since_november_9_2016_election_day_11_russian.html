<p>I think there is no doubt that when any foreign government tries to impact the integrity of our elections … we need to take action,” Obama said. <strong>“And we will – at a time and place of our own choosing.</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>That doesn&#39;t refute any of it. There isn&#39;t even a discussion of the damning evidence contained in the VIPS memo.

    <div class="md"><p>That is an extremely low effort and nonsense response that is conflating several things in the original findings. Its not an appeal to authority - ironic given that appeal to authority is all that we have to believe in the &quot;hacking&quot; story to begin with and the authors own use in claiming &quot;Im a hacker and I do this but Im not going to publish any evidence of my ability to do this&quot;. Adam Carter&#39;s research is intended to stand on its own but as with things of much technical detail - it requires a degree of explanation from people that know what they are talking about. Just as the refutation requires a degree of knowledge, but at some point the refutation requires some evidence too and I&#39;ve yet to see any. The Hill gets so much wrong about the Forensicator argument that you have to wonder how genuine they are in their conclusion.</p>

<p>This describes both what you wrote and the VIPS memo. No security professionals are taking it seriously because it&#39;s a fucking joke. Go to <a href="/r/asknetsec">/r/asknetsec</a> if you don&#39;t believe me, there are already threads on it there. </p>

The &quot;hacking&quot; has gone away, the Steele Dossier isnt a part of that story.
