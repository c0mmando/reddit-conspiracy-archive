        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I often hear the &quot;jet fuel vs steel beams&quot; argument.</p>

<p>Weirdly, no one ever seems to consider the angle that the melting point of steel is not necessarily relevant. </p>

<p>I just did a quick google on the &quot;Festigkeit&quot; (German measure for &quot;structural robustness&quot;) of steel. Only found a chart for iron, but still: <a href="http://dingler.culture.hu-berlin.de/dingler_static/pj312/32199823Z/tx312409a.png">http://dingler.culture.hu-berlin.de/dingler_static/pj312/32199823Z/tx312409a.png</a></p>

<p>Look at it. At 600 degrees Celsius the structural robustness is down to about 1/5th of its original value. Jet fuel apparently burns at 1000 degrees Celsius (quick Google search).</p>

<p>Not making any claims here, I wouldn&#39;t be surprised about an inside job, but I feel like the discussion needs some proper data.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes that does stand to reason, as molecules separate when heated. The fact remains that steel is markedly stronger than iron, so while your post is helpful to get the gears turning in your head, it can in no way be used to support or refute the notion that &quot;jet fuel can&#39;t melt steel beams.&quot;</p>

<p>What caused the building to collapse is the airplane fuel and the fire-suppression system that we now have, which basically blocks off five-floor blocks, so the fire can’t go up and the fire can’t go down. You now have a fire confined to a five-floor area, burning at 2,000 degrees Fahrenheit. <strong>The steel in that five-floor area melts.</strong> All the tonnage above the five-floor area comes straight down when the steel melts. That broke all the connections, and that caused the building to collapse. <em>:: construction manager for the World Trade Center and University of Colorado civil engineering professor Hyman Brown according to <a href="http://archive.boulderweekly.com/102104/coverstory.html">True believers - The 9/11 Truth Movement questions our new day of infamy</a>, Boulder Weekly, Joel Warner, October 2004</em></p>

<p>What caused the building to collapse is the airplane fuel and the fire-suppression system that we now have, which basically blocks off five-floor blocks, so the fire can’t go up and the fire can’t go down. You now have a fire confined to a five-floor area, burning at 2,000 degrees Fahrenheit. <strong>The steel in that five-floor area melts.</strong> All the tonnage above the five-floor area comes straight down when the steel melts.

    <div class="md"><p>With engineers on both sides of the debate,  I don&#39;t blame you for looking into it yourself,  but to attain even 600 degrees Celsius which is only 1100 F in a substantial area of steel superstructure that is dense,  as in the WTC structures,  where any given beam would have taken concentrated heat over time to heat,  and heat disipates rapidly to adjoining steel members would require <em>vast amounts of concentrated heat over substantial time</em> for temperatures of steel in critical areas to reach 600 C or 1100 F.    But the observed temperatures were much higher,  you might say,  which is true,  (again,  what heat source raised the temps over the burning temp of jet fuel).</p>

<p>Yet there wasn&#39;t enough jet fuel contained in internal fires to do the job,  not enough flamable material naturally in the structures.</p>

<p>Also,  that leaves the bottom half of the buildings intact,  and not heated.</p>

<p>Its a matter for real engineers in a real study.   If one side of the engineers are wrong,  I would love to see them really discredited in a real investigation.    I don&#39;t think too many engineers have really sharpened their pencils on this one.    And the official story is obviously a cover up right down the line on every single issue from hijackers to FAA to funding etc.    It would be pretty strange if the only valid part of the cover up was they were honest about the WTC buildings.    Yet they have already been shown to be dishonest.</p>
