    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s the current line ups as I see them</p>

<p>Dark team: EU, UN, UK, Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Sweden, NK, USA (Deep State)</p>

<p>Those are all globalists imo, their goal being the infamous NWO, transhumanism and just basically make us slave to the system even more</p>

<p>Light team: Syria, Russia, Poland, USA (Trump admin), Putin, China
I think those factions basically want to liberate humanity from this oppressive system</p>

<p>China seems to be a recent change of heart. Much like Saudi Arabia I believe may be starting to go through some changes. Next king in line (changed shortly after trump visit) is a supporter or women driving lol</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Putting the definition for reference for others</p>

<blockquote>
<p>trans·hu·man·ism
the belief or theory that the human race can evolve beyond its current physical and mental limitations, especially by means of science and technology.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Globalists want us to merge with machine. We&#39;re seeing the first steps now with RFID chips &quot;for convenience&quot; and I think I saw a couple articles about connecting brains and/or memories to a physical medium. I guess that&#39;s one way to &quot;evolve&quot;, connect everyone to computers and make a global consciousness.</p>

<p>But that&#39;s a trap according to the other school of thought about transhumanism which would be the one which argues everything and everyone in the universe is connected. Our pineal glands being our antennas, we are in effect, all connected to each other, which explains the phenomena of empathy/clairempathy. In essence, the global consciousnesses is a giant computer.</p>

<p>So they actually want to &quot;evolve&quot; us by hiding our biological functions.</p>

<p>Of course, we&#39;re not aware of anything special with us because our pineal gland are calcified (fluoride and others etc)</p>

In my view it is less likely to happen here in the Uk now but still could for the rest of the world. But I suspect that may be part of the pkan because like it or not it seems that the NWO strings are pulled from the City Of London. It seems the Roman Empire never died but became the British Empire and then quietly went about hiding its identity.

<p>I look at it this way one team seeking globalized economy and political system to stop war this group will allow some basic human rights and protect our earth a llittle. </p>

<p>one team will simply u se war and violence on their own population and the population of other nations to achieve dominance, that will include our current US Government, the British Brexit crowd that includes factions in all the British nations, Russia and their current allies.  </p>

<p>I think both China and India will prefer the no war alignment but will and can stay independent to some degree, after all they have all those people and that is still a factor even if not needed for labor. </p>

<p>And really are you looking forward to bring a Russian style system to this country and if so why?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been trying to wrap my head around it all too, particularly all the different factions and definitions of the term. What seems clear is that the term &quot;globalists&quot; has been subtly warped away from &quot;globalization&quot; (the corporate takeover of the world&#39;s economies and slow destruction of the working class in industrially-developed, more advanced nations). These destructive efforts are largely given a pass by the virulently capitalist and Alex Jones-tier critics, aside from the trade policies that allow it to continue. Now the term &quot;globalist&quot; is meant to encapsulate NWO-type figures and movements, along the lines of the whole Soviet-era &quot;internationalist&quot; position. Also just so happens to cast &quot;nationalist&quot; adherents and movements as the great heroes of the political time period. </p>

<p>But this neglects the alliances various nationalist groups and regimes have themselves been fostering for several years. I believe Putin obviously and Erdogan potentially are a part of this, as are the neo-fascist parties throughout the EU. And the people behind Brexit, Netanyahu&#39;s regime in Israel, and the more nationalist wing of the Trump administration.</p>

<p>An attempt to launch a right-wing NWO in supposed defense of a left-wing NWO? Potentially. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Battle for Souls.  If you wanna extrapolate it that far.  Enshrined feudalism with &quot;them&quot; as the landlords is the worldly end goal, slightly less extrapolation.  But, money and tungsten prolly accounts for the majority of short-term motivation.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve arrived at your questions from working backwards.  I started with myth and legend, and the rabbit hole took me to modern-day.  Others start with modern-day and go down the rabbit the until they end at myth and legend.  IMHO, these are unbroken chains of thought/belief.</p>

<p>Factions:</p>

<p>Aristotle vs Plato - feudalism vs urbanism.  In theory, both want to enslave.  Modern day:  Who are the neo-Platonians, who are the Aristotoleans (no neo as this line of thought remains unbroken).</p>

<p>Fire vs Water - Cain vs Abel.  Action vs Faith.  Modern day:  Who is Fire, and who is Water is a good question to ask oneself.  </p>

<p>Babylon vs The Bible - Babylon --&gt; Egypt --&gt; Rome --&gt; London.   The more you know about Babylon, the more you know about modern day rule.</p>

<p>Factions:</p>

<p>Khazarian Mafia
Cult of Apollo
Cult of Neptune
Cult of Mars (see Apollo)
Cult of Venus/Diana
Saturn worship in general
Freemasonry
Jesuits
Lost Tribe of Dan
Bloodlines of the Bible/the 13 Bloodlines/ lotsa names for this concept</p>

<p>To directly answer your questions, to the best of my knowledge (admittedly I am just a well-read goy).</p>

<p>1 - Hell Yes.  </p>

<p>The Saudi&#39;s are one of the 13 bloodline families, tracing their roots back to <em>(they care)</em>_.  This is why we see a lot of cooperation between Saudis and the West.  Saudi&#39;s consider themselves in the same group as the Rothschilds, Hapsburgs, and other Bloodlines.  Also why they are so close to Israel.  They are both children of Jacob.</p>

<p>Much the same for the ruling Chinese elites, the Li&#39;s.  This is the dragon bloodline, one of the 13.  Not really sure how an asian race can claim biblical blood but, whatever.  I think they also claim some celestial connection (alien blood, etc) so maybe this is their hereditary ticket.</p>

<p>Russians - Not so much.  They&#39;ve been the target of the Bloodlines for some time.  The Rus people are cold, hard, Christian, and conservative.  This is a tough group to change through propaganda and revolution.  Seems they prefer more direct action when dealing with the Rus.  Putin himself... great question.  The debate rages in these circles.</p>

<p>2 - Yes, but not across the firm dividing lines of Fire/Water, Plato/Aristotle, when it comes to dealing with us.  They may ally at the corporate or business level, trivial in comparison.</p>

<p>3 - I get the sense both Putin and Erdogan are patriotic leaders looking out for the best interests of their people, more or less.  However, I spend more time in myth and legend than modern day.  Putin maybe a Jew, in which case the connection to the Bolsheviks is likely, and his rule illegitimate.</p>

<p>4 - see my list above.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s a few ways of looking at god, let me help you.</p>

<p>God old testament is the Mystery.  It&#39;s evil and wrathful.</p>

<p>god new testament is Jesus propitiation through love.  Through the line of David is &#39;god.&#39;</p>

<p>god for the people in the region was also everyone who had a innate fractal of god within themselves, and the stranger whom you did not know.  Like how the greeks hospitality superstition works.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re being lied to.  There are no factions.  That is their strength.</p>

<p>They own every country in the world and have since the creation of the cestue que vie accounts in 1666.  It has turned against them though, as the beast system has grown beyond the control of the Vatican.  The globalists turned on the church when they ignored the Pope&#39;s call for Motu Proprio.  </p>

<p>The accounts are up for auction right now, so we will probably be sold to Russia, Saudia Arabia, or China(again) and enter back into the virtual slavery that we&#39;ve suffered under for 150 years now.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s more nuanced than that.</p>

<p>Within the American elite, there are clearly established sides and shifting alliances. It can be convenient to think of the Koch brothers and George Soros as taking opposite sides in American politics.</p>

<p>The Deep State in the US is similarly split, as made apparent during the push for the Iraq War. The Plame affair makes this obvious.</p>

<p>The Iraq War was also telling for revealing how closely American and British intelligence worked together to convince the world that the war was necessary.</p>

<p>BRICS countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa) are generally contrasted with American-European alliance. They have formed their own financial institutions to serve as counterparts to institutions like the World Bank and the IMF.</p>

<p>Russia and China especially tend to cooperate in the geopolitical sphere in opposition to western powers, while India and South Africa are more open to cooperation with both sides. Economically, China is promiscuous.</p>

<p>Speaking more generally on economics, all the players tend to cooperate, with geopolitics and economics alternating in primacy. Russia sells fossil fuels to Europe, but this is being sanctioned due to geopolitics. More restrictive sanctions are tough to implement due to the fossil fuel trade, making this a difficult balancing act.</p>

<p>You also have large multinational corporations that have their own agendas - generally they want tough international IP laws, free trade, and no taxes. They invent tax maneuvers like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_Irish_arrangement">Double Irish with a Dutch Sandwich</a>.</p>

<p>It&#39;s complicated. Anyone who pushes the idea of a unified elite is naive, at best.</p>

<p>Pushing the idea of &#39;factions&#39; at significant odds within globalism miss the nature of globalism.  But it&#39;s great to tell the kids via the globalists&#39; alt-media shills, because how else do you gain the support and participation of the Masses without giving them someone to cheer for?</p>

<p>And it works, so long as the People mindlessly consume rhetoric the alt-media pushes at them, and naively refuse to do their research.  It&#39;s the same thing the Masses used to do with the MSM; only now, the alt-media is the new globalist replacement.</p>

<p>Reassuringly, the rhetoric can be dispelled with just a little research and investigation:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>None of the factions I mentioned are opposed to globalism. Corporations clearly want a global order pushing free trade and low taxes so they can make more money, western powers want a global order friendly to western interests (free trade, strong IP protection), while eastern powers want a global order friendly to their own interests (Russia wants to increase its sphere of influence in eastern Europe, China wants to increase its sphere of influence in Asia). </p>

<p>You&#39;ve linked to a hypothesis that the &quot;traditional&quot; western NWO is intentionally screwing up the world to make people ask to be saved by a new eastern NWO led by BRICS. This is another overarching conspiracy that attempts to unify all players into a single elite entity. It is entirely unnecessary to explain what&#39;s happening.</p>

<p>The current global elite in the west are screwing up the world because they&#39;re greedy. BRICS leadership isn&#39;t likely to be any better. The new &quot;multipolar&quot; framework is coming about because China is rising as an economic superpower and challenging the status quo. This doesn&#39;t require any secret cooperation between the Chinese elite and western elite.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Battle for Souls.  If you wanna extrapolate it that far.  Enshrined feudalism with &quot;them&quot; as the landlords is the worldly end goal, slightly less extrapolation.  But, money and tungsten prolly accounts for the majority of short-term motivation.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve arrived at your questions from working backwards.  I started with myth and legend, and the rabbit hole took me to modern-day.  Others start with modern-day and go down the rabbit the until they end at myth and legend.  IMHO, these are unbroken chains of thought/belief.</p>

<p>Factions:</p>

<p>Aristotle vs Plato - feudalism vs urbanism.  In theory, both want to enslave.  Modern day:  Who are the neo-Platonians, who are the Aristotoleans (no neo as this line of thought remains unbroken).</p>

<p>Fire vs Water - Cain vs Abel.  Action vs Faith.  Modern day:  Who is Fire, and who is Water is a good question to ask oneself.  </p>

<p>Babylon vs The Bible - Babylon --&gt; Egypt --&gt; Rome --&gt; London.   The more you know about Babylon, the more you know about modern day rule.</p>

<p>Factions:</p>

<p>Khazarian Mafia
Cult of Apollo
Cult of Neptune
Cult of Mars (see Apollo)
Cult of Venus/Diana
Saturn worship in general
Freemasonry
Jesuits
Lost Tribe of Dan
Bloodlines of the Bible/the 13 Bloodlines/ lotsa names for this concept</p>

<p>To directly answer your questions, to the best of my knowledge (admittedly I am just a well-read goy).</p>

<p>1 - Hell Yes.  </p>

<p>The Saudi&#39;s are one of the 13 bloodline families, tracing their roots back to <em>(they care)</em>_.  This is why we see a lot of cooperation between Saudis and the West.  Saudi&#39;s consider themselves in the same group as the Rothschilds, Hapsburgs, and other Bloodlines.  Also why they are so close to Israel.  They are both children of Jacob.</p>

<p>Much the same for the ruling Chinese elites, the Li&#39;s.  This is the dragon bloodline, one of the 13.  Not really sure how an asian race can claim biblical blood but, whatever.  I think they also claim some celestial connection (alien blood, etc) so maybe this is their hereditary ticket.</p>

<p>Russians - Not so much.  They&#39;ve been the target of the Bloodlines for some time.  The Rus people are cold, hard, Christian, and conservative.  This is a tough group to change through propaganda and revolution.  Seems they prefer more direct action when dealing with the Rus.  Putin himself... great question.  The debate rages in these circles.</p>

<p>2 - Yes, but not across the firm dividing lines of Fire/Water, Plato/Aristotle, when it comes to dealing with us.  They may ally at the corporate or business level, trivial in comparison.</p>

<p>3 - I get the sense both Putin and Erdogan are patriotic leaders looking out for the best interests of their people, more or less.  However, I spend more time in myth and legend than modern day.  Putin maybe a Jew, in which case the connection to the Bolsheviks is likely, and his rule illegitimate.</p>

<p>4 - see my list above.</p>
