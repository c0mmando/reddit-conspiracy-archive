       I get there are a couple, but surely the demo crew would have at least one person.

       if you can imagine that 20 deaths would be noticeable then i can imagine 20 orphans being raised in a military compound for the specific purpose of rigging 9/11.  Like I said above, asking "why not" questions is just an exercise in imagination.  It's not an avenue to evidence.

       Anybody that says they know the truth is lying. We have circumstantial evidence and nothing more.
      </p>

       But what we do know is that the official report is a lie. If it was up to me, I'd put those involved in the commission over the coals and start working my way back.

       And office fires is not an acceptable reason to me. NIST have been proven to be wrong on that -

       If you're actually interested and not just here to try and have a bit of fun trolling (as i'm starting to suspect that you are), then you really should go an look at the website i linked and go through the videos.
      </p>
      <p>
       The people involved are a lot more knowledgeable about the physics of the collapse of 7, than i am. They may even address the sprinkler issue too.

       I'm just saying I don't know what happens to a high rise on fire, as it usually gets suppressed, what if nobody touches it? I don't think they would send responders into an already evacuated building.

       And here's the problem. For every question you ask it raises another question with me.
      </p>
      <p>
       This time its about Larry Silverstein. If the building was being left to burn and had no responders inside, why did the building owner say the following?
      </p>
      <p>
       "I remember getting a call from the fire department commander, telling me that they were not sure they were gonna be able to contain the fire, and I said, "We've had such terrible loss of life, maybe the smartest thing to do is pull it." And they made that decision to pull and we watched the building collapse.
      </p>
      <p>
       Obviously 'pull it' brings up other questions... but in relation to our conversation, that quote suggests that they were trying hard to save the building.

       yes I have. I don't belive in that, if it wasn't a passenger plane, it would be a drone.

       Yes quite possibly. I was just making the point that it could be anything but planes and hence no passengers

       AND/OR all of those not important enough (especially if they could be easily replaced) were given perm "vacations."  You can't blow a whistle if you aren't breathing.  The Devil is in the details.

       An operation properly ran (and compartmentalized) will have their own operators believing a false narrative, too.  Redundancy after redundancy in place.  Travel agents for each contractor, etc.

       Those that did this are the most evil and vile version of any creation you can imagine.  As I said before, the Devil is in the details.
