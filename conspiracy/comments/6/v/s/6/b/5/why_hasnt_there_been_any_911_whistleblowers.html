    <div class="md"><p>And here&#39;s the problem. For every question you ask it raises another question with me. </p>

<p>This time its about Larry Silverstein. If the building was being left to burn and had no responders inside, why did the building owner say the following? </p>

<p>&quot;I remember getting a call from the fire department commander, telling me that they were not sure they were gonna be able to contain the fire, and I said, &quot;We&#39;ve had such terrible loss of life, maybe the smartest thing to do is pull it.&quot; And they made that decision to pull and we watched the building collapse.</p>

<p>Obviously &#39;pull it&#39; brings up other questions... but in relation to our conversation, that quote suggests that they were trying hard to save the building.</p>
