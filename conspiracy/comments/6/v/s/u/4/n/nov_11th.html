<p>Where was everyone &amp; what was the surrounding publics reactions like? I only ask since I watched one of those news compilation videos of worldwide reactions. </p>

<p>Edit: just realized mid blunt I put November???? I&#39;m so sorry if I&#39;ve offended anyone &amp; to answer someone&#39;s Q yes the Ethiopian thing is true; Ethiopia follows the Byzantine calendar so whenever there&#39;s a leap year here, Ethiopia has a 13th month consisting of the leftover days that would be used in a leap year in a Gregorian calendar. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was chilling at my place - in bed just laying down.  A good little buddy of mine (rip) started slamming on my door saying &quot;Wake up!  Wake up!  We&#39;re under attack!!&quot;  I said, &quot;Hold on, man.  Lemmie get some clothes on.&quot;  He said &quot;I don&#39;t care!  Just open the DOOR!!&quot;</p>

<p>I let him in and he was full on in tears, crying pretty badly, and shaken up.  I was like &quot;What&#39;s going on?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;We&#39;re under attack we&#39;re under attack!!&quot;</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t know what he was talking about since I don&#39;t have a tv.  We went downstairs to someone else&#39;s room who did have a tv.  Saw one building w/a hole in it, smoke coming out, and then boom.  Saw them both come down.</p>

<p>People were freaking out around me.</p>

<p>The news was saying it was &quot;radical muslim middle easterners&quot;, and I remember the exact thought I had at that particular moment &quot;If it&#39;s &#39;radical muslim middle easterners&#39;, then I can understand why they would do such a thing.  I mean we the United States have been antagonizing them for so many years.  We&#39;ve killed their mothers and fathers and sisters and brothers - right in front of their faces.  That&#39;s a horror, a nightmare, a travesty.  I know that if I saw any one of the women in my immediate family murdered in front of my face, I would simply make it my entire life&#39;s goal at that point to absolutely kill everyone even <em>mildly</em> responsible for it.&quot;</p>

<p>Later I found out it was a false flag attack perpetrated upon the American people by the multinational corporate elite with the help of Zionist Ashkenazi Khazars and the Saudis.</p>

<p>Super fucked up planet this is.</p>

Man, it sure is amazing that over 4,000 Israelis and I don&#39;t know how many Ethiopians besides Eskedar all got advanced warning about not being at work on 9/11 and not a single one of them mentioned anything about the odd email/phone warning telling them not to go to work that day to their non-Jewish, non-Ethiopian friends and coworkers.
