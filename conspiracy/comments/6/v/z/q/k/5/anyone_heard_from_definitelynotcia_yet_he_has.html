       A day and a half ago, user Definitely-Not-CIA made a post that he had a tumor and going in for surgery (surgery was yesterday). He stated that he had a 40% chance of pulling through.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've been praying/meditating (sending positive energy) his way ever since.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyone heard from him yet in a private message? He hasn't publicly posted for over 24 hours.

       Yes, I'm sure he will be in the hospital for a few days. But he never said his location. So he may have his laptop/ipad/iphone or whatever with him. But then again, maybe not.

       That's what we call being a good human being. This is what the world needs! When it all comes down to it we have all the same struggles, problems, hopes and dreams. What get's in the way of seeing people for who they are...

       Our neighbors aren't as scary as we are being told. What ever happened to the days of block parties, and neighborhood pool parties. Now we just lock ourselves away and never get to know the people we live next too...

       Honestly if you put a black person and a White Supremacist alone together in a room, I wonder if the WS could still hold his ground in hating that person...

      <p>
       There was a video where they put people in a pitch black room, and they all discussed their lives, beliefs...etc. And when they turned the lights on people were astounded on what they said vs what they looked like...very interesting!

       Anytime you hear stories about racists changing their ways, those stories usually involve a patient and caring black man showing the racist kindness.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only way to defeat racism is through love. Fighting them serves only to
       <strong>
        embolden
       </strong>
       them.
      </p>
      <p>
       People who "punch Nazis" are serving only to
       <em>
        inflate
       </em>
       the racism problem, and therefore, they are just as bad as the Nazis themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       It makes me so mad, I just wanna go out and punch a Nazi-puncher.

       Just because he doesn't buy the right-wing propaganda like the Seth Rich narrative doesn't mean he doesn't belong here. Many of us are libertarians skeptical of the 2 party system. We believe the conspiracy is that corporations and bankers are pulling the strings. We don't fall for the phony, divisive conspiracies cooked up to divide us into tribes.

       You are playing right into the very thing you claim you don't "fall for" and is "phony". The Seth Rich conspiracy is
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       right wing. I consider myself a Libertarian (and would have voted that way of Johnson wasn't a doofus). My brother is a full on Socialist (not even Bernie socialist,
       <em>
        true
       </em>
       socialist). My cousin is out rioting with the fucknuts Antifa.
      </p>
      <p>
       They all believe there's more to the Seth Rich story than we're being told.

       Thanks for this - I fall into the some of the same boats. Crimes like murder and espionage are not "right" or "left". In fact we don't even have a real "left" in this country if we're to be honest. But splitting things up like that sure does a good job of turning facts into opinions and crimes into innuendo. It's a very effective tactic.
      </p>
      <p>
       Still - I wish CIA all the best and hope he's made it through.

       So you don't believe in the 2 party system, but yet Fox is "right wing" and is the only one pushing the conspiracy? How is Fox "right wing" when the right wing is something you don't believe in?
      </p>

       Also, how is it that a "right-wing" conspiracy is believed by a great many people of all political ideologies, many who don't even watch Fox?

       You're totally missing my point, which doesn't surprise me considering how you dismiss something using the very thing you claim TPTB are using to divide us.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let me spell it out. You said the "left" and "right" dichotomy is being used to divide the people, presumably believing that's a bad thing. You then go on to describe the Seth Rich conspiracy as a "right wing" thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       So you basically just did what TPTB wanted you to do -- you used left and right wing to divide people, presumably something you think is bad. But maybe you don't, because you apparently have no problem doing it when it suits you.

       Because you claimed he was here to detract from the community, when he often debunks right-wing conspiracy theories. I'm saying that they are as much fair game as left wing theories, since both are used to control the populous. The more people see the illusion presented by their side, the more likely they are to see the big picture.

       The problem is your perpetuating the idea of "sides". Our politicians, minus a rare few, are neocons. That's it. To your point, one I actually agree with, there are no real "sides".
      </p>
      <p>
       But by continuing to phrase everything as "left" and "right", you just play right into their hands. And, again, it's something you've claimed to be against.

       If i were in a really bad place, emotionally speaking, as a result of a brain tumor, maybe i'd be angry at the world and lash out? Pick fights? Ir maybe be depressed and a total downer all the time? Or maybe if i had a brain tumor, I literally wouldn't be able to think straight? We all go through hard times and we all have different coping mechanisms. Not everyone has healthy coping mechanisms. We still need to love and support him as a fellow human being.

       He's not just a shit poster mate, and the person who made this thread isn't either it's almost like they are trying to make the subject some sort of r/conspiracy legend which they are categorically not.

       I would imagine brain surgery has you incapacitated for awhile if you pull through. Hopefully for him his surgeons worked their magic an he makes it.
      </p>
      <p>
       From what I read from his original post it was brain tumor removal. Could that possibly cause him to have to re-learn speech and walking and all that? Does anyone know more details about what he was going for?
      </p>

       It is nice to see people having concern for a fellow human. No matter what side of the fence they are on in this sub.   Imagine what we could accomplish if we could do this all the time.

       I'm hoping there was no complications.

       Anytime you hear stories about racists changing their ways, those stories usually involve a patient and caring black man showing the racist kindness.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only way to defeat racism is through love. Fighting them serves only to
       <strong>
        embolden
       </strong>
       them.
      </p>
      <p>
       People who "punch Nazis" are serving only to
       <em>
        inflate
       </em>
       the racism problem, and therefore, they are just as bad as the Nazis themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       It makes me so mad, I just wanna go out and punch a Nazi-puncher.
