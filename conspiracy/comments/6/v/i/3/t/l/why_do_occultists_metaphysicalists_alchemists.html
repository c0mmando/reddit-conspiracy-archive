       Our pre-scientific ancestors, staring at the stars and the world around them, not having any knowledge of  what these stars  and other phenomenon are. 
Now we have knowledge about the Cosmos that no human should rightfully know, and its wierder, stranger than any myth could have guessed. Because of this Knowledge, we have Predictive Powers that are so precise, its almost magical.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yet this science/knowledge/predictive powers is dismissed, ignored, minimized,( or even boring!?). Culturaly defined as emotionaly unsatisfying, un-Beautiful, anti-artistic, boring, cold, unspiritual.
..why?
From an occultists POV, whats more magical , " forbidden" and stranger than particle physics, black holes, E=MC2. Etc?
      </p>
      <p>
       Why is this Naturalism rejected as False, when its validating predictive powers is so sucsessful by orders of magnitude? Compared to the Predictive Powers of for example, Astrology or Tarot, prophecies etc?

       Possibly more damage, I dont know.  Thats an ethical question and doesnt apply to the guy who invented Bronze arrow heads for hunting  vs. warfare, for example.
We also have doubled life spans and less 50% childhood mortalities, and decreased Suffering (can occultists and metaphysics claim the same?)

       Yes I understand the difference between certainty in science and knowing. Youre assuming too much stereotypical "science is my religion" stuff, not your fault, my English is substandard.
      </p>
      <p>
       Im sure your aware of the differences between science and religion.. religion does not support nor does it progress by proving itself wrong. While scientific progress can be measured by falsifying its own idea.
      </p>
      <p>
       When the questions or ideas of Reality and Truth come up so often as it does here, then its fair to advocate a time tested sucsessful self correcting method in finding Reality, the best method we have so far to seperate the static and noise from the Big Picture, given the Predictive Powers that validate a material scientific world view.
I know its not welcome here and Im the minority, thats fine. Im just the messenger in a postmodern popculture that no longer recognizes the value  and authority, of a strict reliable method to seperate fact from fiction.  observation/ predict/ test/repeat..

       It seems like you’re missing that these aren’t mutually exclusive things...

       I might draw the tarot to allow myself to give a narrative to my emotions, then use reason to chart a course to where I’d like to be.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can have a decision with no clear better option to make and consult a horoscope to feel better about my decision.

       We have many such moments that we often leave to preprogrammed routines. Shaking these up can improve our experiential reality and increase awareness that we can then use in all sorts of situations including logic.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have no problem with scientific-materialism, except for the litany of unintended consequences most scientific materialists chalk up to the cost of progress. Indeed, scientific materialism has fantastic uses it’s simply piss poor for deriving personal meaning and tends to instill an unwarranted sense of confidence. I wouldn’t go see a man about a lobotomy to cure my desire, but I might consult the Buddha or Jesus.

       So I can appreciate indoor plumbing, not want to develop Alzheimer’s from the Copper (II) in the pipes that bring me water, and I can read my tea leaves to help assist my intuitive reasoning. None of these things are better or worse than the other.

       In fact, many of the greatest historical scientists were also occultists! Studying the great mysteries of the past often leads to new cool tricks.

       Occultism, Esotericism and Mysticism are philosophical schools of thought; alchemy is "the work", and (likely) metaphorical in describing the rules/laws of the first three.
      </p>
      <p>
       Symbolism, allegorical relationships and metaphors passed through the ages to guide practitioners back to the source--hopefully to escape this material experience.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ultimate knowledge that this existence is a step on the path up the mountain, and death is not the summit.

       At least, that's what it looks like from where I'm standing--but I've only been walking with my head up for a brief amount of time.

       describes it really well.

       I would like to add that is moreover about putting meaning to items, symbols and ideas. By putting meaning you ignite your intend to believe. With willpower you want to make something work, or want to believe that an item holds symbolic value (like a picture, or a piece of jewelry does for many). Whether or not you putting meaning to something actually channels a higher energy, that will always remain hidden / unknown - which is what occult itself means.

       I know occultism, probably not in the new age modern illdefined sense. More from alchemy era and history...which was pre scientific attempts at manipulating the universe to ones benefit..agency behind the motions of things. .." If I mix copper with boron under the sign of venus while its a full moon, then the elemental powers will do something I want....in a (sarcastic)  simplified nut shell.

       Much of occult/esoteric/philosophical knowledge was actually working out the grammar that underlies naturalism. It’s not too much of a stretch to conceive that many of the mystery schools were remnants of guild knowledge left over and transmogrified from a more advanced pre-historic civilization.
      </p>
      <p>
       Naturalism is still reliant on allegory and is often so occluded (naturally, not through intent necessarily) as to be indistinguishable from occult thought for most individuals. A bag of magic tricks that work “well enough” to accomplish certain things but break down at differing macro/micro levels.
      </p>
      <p>
       Given the historical and practical incompleteness of natural theory I fully expect the average person to continue to attribute how things work to mystical sources and myopic know-it-all’s to continue to laugh at the average people cause they “know” how a few tricks work.

       We probably have different definitions of Naturalism.
I am speaking in scientific philosophical context "Philosophical Naturalism" is a fancy way of saying a nonsupernatural material scientific reductionist  POV

       But your POV is the reason why I posted this.
I have no problems with holouniverse, its a cool concept.
"Romantic "in the aesthetic  sense.  As a "Hard" scientist, I dont understand the appeal of a theory that has no  incoming quantifiable data, no observational value, no efficiancy , no predictive powers, nothing to touch feel measure
....its like philosophy (boring , unquantifiable,and unsatisfying...but I am bias)
      </p>
      <p>
       While dismissing the complexities(and emotional satisfaction) of Natural Sciences as having less value, less legitimacy than a holotheory that lacks any data.

       Have you looked for data within the holofractal community?  I think you're Gravely mistaken and taking an assumptive perspective.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know much about naturalism so I can't make any general claims about what it is you believe, but holofractal is based on data.  I don't necessarily trust in the agenda behind it and can't tell what kind of person Haramein truly is but he seems playful and intelligent in a childish way which I'd expect a genius of his caliber to be.

       I'll give you specific example of my angle into the topic. When someone watches pornography, it elicits changes in the body. When I think of a girl I like, it also elicits changes in the body (heart beating faster for example). For many, if you use the right insult, they get angry and maybe physical. My point? Words alone can affect changes in us that we do not control.
      </p>
      <p>
       Occultism is in part ways to use the concept. The point of rituals, sigils...is mostly to put the practitioner in a different state of mind while trying to control (direct) the changes.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do not know how science could help. Maybe thing like this show the way:

       Well sometimes, like with alchemy for instance, it isn't meant to be interpreted literally. It's all metaphor for self-growth and personal development. Apparently.
      </p>
      <p>
       Religion or mythology or esoterica or whatever — at least this is my take on things — isn't so much a belief as it a language. It's a tool for expressing and coming to terms with one's experience of life. This is why muslims in the war-torn, destabilized regions of the world might focus on the more violent, jihadist portions of the collective muslim teachings, whereas those in more peaceful environments that don't necessitate such a brutal life
       <strong>
        coincidentally
       </strong>
       focus on the more peaceful teachings. This goes for all religions. Now you won't hear believers admit this, or assholes like Sam Harris, but religious texts don't inspire anyone to believe or do anything. These texts are actually a kind of justification for one's preexisting internal beliefs caused by environment/life experiences.
      </p>
      <p>
       So people turn to things like esoterica for a number of reasons. One, as I said, is that they really don't mean to do science. They mean to express human-wide subjective experiences. Two, they really believe this shit is literal and fancy themselves wizards. Three, maybe they're just LARPing. Or Four, it could just be a bit of fun.
      </p>
      <p>
       As to why people choose this particularly
       <em>
        over
       </em>
       Naturalism, I'd wager it's because, at least in America, we have a terrible education system that doesn't teach math or science in any meaningful way, and we discourage students who don't immediately have an alleged 'talent' for it.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's also far more glamorous to be interested in the occult. Even if people are equally uninformed about scientific phenomenon like black holes as they are something like the philosopher's stone, the slow, methodical, reductionist, mechanical march of science can seem to take a lot of the mystique away from mysteries that elude our understanding.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think it's also true that people don't like science because they can't make shit up and get away with it like you can occultism. You can't really get called out on your bad, uniformed ideas since you can always hide behind some invisible nonsensical 'magic'. 'Oh your vibrations just aren't in tune with the universe brah, your theory is wrong.'

       Im thinking this divide between Naturalistic Pov and the more emotionaly satisfying metaphysics  and the False Dicotomy of   "Cold Factual "Naturalism vs emotionaly satisfying metaphysics is  strictly a postmodern cultural phenom.

       My curiosity and constant surprise is that nobody else I know  in my 50 years validates that........on both sides of the spectrum,except maybe Sagans spiritual attitudes, but I never meet those types in my real life, rural mormonville USA.

       Here's the thing. So-called occult knowledge is real, and has power. The elites want to preserve this for themselves. So they have to keep the population away from it.
      </p>
      <p>
       So in mainstream religion, the idea is promoted that the occult is "dangerous."
      </p>
      <p>
       And in mainstream science, a strict materialism is enforced throughout academic culture, even though the results are getting spookier and spookier.

       There are a lot of frauds, can't argue with that.
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem is that because of peer pressure in the scientific community, the proof is either suppressed or ignored.
      </p>
      <p>
       So what happens is... 1) Some scientist or study emerges that points to the reality of certain esoteric concepts 2) It is suppressed or ignored through peer pressure 3) the New Age community latches on to it and starts promoting it with zero real understanding of the science involved 4) this makes it even more difficult for scientists to come out in favor of certain ideas that are perceived as "woo woo." It's a vicious cycle.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some points to consider:
      </p>
      <p>
       The U.S. government has studied the occult scientifically. These researchers were known as the Collins Elite, I believe. So right there we see that there are different scientific paradigms for the government and the rabble.
      </p>
      <p>
       This idea of scientists being strict materialists really only got started in the 20th century. Previous to that, it was common for scientists to have an interest in esoteric ideas. Isaac Newton, for example, had a keen interest in occult studies and alchemical ideas, it's on his wiki page if you're interested. He is one of the smartest men who ever lived.

       This is a strange thread to me, consisting of opinions, so I'll throw mine in as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's two things to distinguish here. Intelligence and knowledge. It is easy to see that knowledge has continued to increase from the dawn of man - just as a child adds on to their knowledge over their lifetime - but intelligence is a metric that is much more difficult to observe change in.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you believe evolutionary hypothesis, both knowledge and intelligence have increased together as mankind has been getting older. However, most religions have intelligence at the dawn of humans either identical to what we have now, or superior to what we currently posses, which means while we have more knowledge to work with, we're getting dumber and dumber and will continually be less able to improve our knowledge.
      </p>
      <p>
       History really seems to back up the fact our ancestors were much, much smarter than us, even if they had less knowledge. Obviously, some knowledge is always lost as time goes on, but I'm taking about the overall sum here.

       Can't really speak for much of what you are addressing by this post, but I think our modern academic institutions have established a track record of IGNORING the scientific method in favor of ego/profit in lab scenarios which I'm sure is a large contributing factor to this erosion.
      </p>

       Lots of people like to assume that people who wrote on in old dusty books or on stone tablets were not liars, despite it becoming so  common in our present day.

       Have you seen the John Dee Sonnet book breakdown?
      </p>
      <p>
       Mystery schools have held knowledge that took 'Naturalization' hundreds of years to 'discover', and that is why 'hidden knowledge' is so intriguing to so many.
      </p>
      <p>
       If those in the mystery schools understood critical rules and laws of physics hundreds of years before modern science discovered them, then what might these mystery schools know today?
      </p>
      <p>
       Mystery schools are a test of sorts - certain types of thinkers will never find the entrance. No offense, but I think you might be one of those people. There are those of us who know, and those of us still asking questions. 'The only thing I know is that i do not know'. If you can't get behind that, mystery schools will never make sense or appeal to you.

       and what do those things have to do with mystery schools?

       You asked what these people find so fascinating about 'forbidden knowledge', and IMO the answer is mystery. They want to know what we don't know. It's as simple as that.
      </p>
      <p>
       As far as whether you are 'one of those people' or not, that is not up to me to determine or know. However, due to the question subject, i'm assuming you don't know the answer to the question you are asking for input on.

       Much of occult/esoteric/philosophical knowledge was actually working out the grammar that underlies naturalism. It’s not too much of a stretch to conceive that many of the mystery schools were remnants of guild knowledge left over and transmogrified from a more advanced pre-historic civilization.
      </p>
      <p>
       Naturalism is still reliant on allegory and is often so occluded (naturally, not through intent necessarily) as to be indistinguishable from occult thought for most individuals. A bag of magic tricks that work “well enough” to accomplish certain things but break down at differing macro/micro levels.
      </p>
      <p>
       Given the historical and practical incompleteness of natural theory I fully expect the average person to continue to attribute how things work to mystical sources and myopic know-it-all’s to continue to laugh at the average people cause they “know” how a few tricks work.
