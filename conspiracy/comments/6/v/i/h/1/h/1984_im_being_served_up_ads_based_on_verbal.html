        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Facebook recently served up a sponsored post to me from the page of a documentary film. It caught my attention because I&#39;d never searched for the film, never watched it, but was being told about it verbally by my cousin, in person, a day or two before I saw the sponsored post. Of course my phone was with me, but I don&#39;t even have the Facebook app on it. Needless to say, it kinda freaked me out. </p>

<p>Since then, it&#39;s happened a few more times from Pandora. My coworker listens to it on his computer, and we&#39;ve heard ads directly related to things we&#39;ve been talking about, sometimes just a couple of minutes after we mention something. </p>

<p>Just wondering if anyone here has had a similar experience.</p>

<p>You know what I was thinking? Ads <em>do</em> work. They really do. On a subconscious level.</p>

<p>Also you know how in Futurama they put ads in dreams?</p>

<p>I mean I&#39;m starting to think that isn&#39;t far-fetched.</p>

<p>But isn&#39;t it funny with all this technological progress...the result will be the efficiency of advertisements? Haha. It&#39;s sad</p>

<p>It is funny you mention 1984 and technological advancements. In Orwell&#39;s &#39;fictional dystopia&#39;, the telescreens are used to lie to the masses about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ad1iCYcdyiM">the military and war</a>. Food for thought.</p>

<p>Definitely, if they didn&#39;t hundreds of billions of dollars wouldn&#39;t be spent every year on marketing. Enough wealth to feed the world and then some right there. And it&#39;s not just to get kids to ask for McNuggets and Coca Cola with their first words, it&#39;s think tanks shaping public opinion through &#39;news&#39; too. </p>

<p>I&#39;m also starting to wonder if ads are targeted based on what people within a network are searching - then the topic would more likely to come up in conversation before someone sees an ad. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s being downvoted because enough people have experience with one off situations where they mentioned something totally unrelated. Like myself. So whilst these explanation are definitively part of the whole snooping scheme, there is far deeper stuff going on.

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been felling the same way, started making notes lately every time I notice something. </p>

<p>A few days ago I looked at an instagram picture of my friend on an iphone, she was wearing glasses I hadn&#39;t seen. I thought to myself &quot;those are cute maybe I should get a pair&quot; and later that day was researching a hiking route online (hadn&#39;t searched anything else and haven&#39;t searched glasses in like 3 or 4 years) and got a sidebar with ads for similar looking glasses. </p>

<p>Today was reading a bunch of outdoors stuff again, Googling brands and mountains and stuff, in article about rock climbing on my Windows PC. The woman mentioned Great Lakes Hydrolyzed Collagen. I searched that, then clicked a link about adding it to coffee. In that article she mentioned her skin was nice and she also used Rose Hip Oil and another product. I didn&#39;t linger on it and only briefly thought &quot;I should buy myself some Rose Hip Oil&quot; and then carried on.</p>

<p>I looked at something on my iPhone about an hour later, and there was an ad for Rose Hip Oil. </p>

<p>So fricking weird. You&#39;d think I&#39;d have an ad for an outdoor brand or something... but the only ad I got was for the thing I thought about buying. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>sure they have. its like people using Alexa, Siri, and stuff like this. Then complain that they are listening. Thats beyond stupid. Same as using facebook. You sign a contract when using services like these. And they say what they do right out in the TOS / EULA. Its a trade. So if you use their service you cant complain afterwards. It doesnt make any freaking sense.</p>

<p>You only use smartphones, apps, services that don&#39;t require you to relinquish your rights?</p>

<p>My point being, there are very few if any choices in tech that will allow one to operate in a business capacity which is required for almost everyone while retaining one&#39;s right to privacy. There is no choice. FB, Twitter, Google, Instagram are just the most glaring instances of it all.  </p>

<p>You&#39;ve undoubtedly relinquished your rights to a TOS somewhere. That does not mean, nor should it mean that you just throw up your arms and accept your fate. If nothing else, complain about it. Take it a step farther and lobby against it. </p>

And literally seconds after thinking a random very specific &quot;shower thought&quot; an ad has popped up that feels downright wrong for Google Ads to even have on a major website. That thought was &quot;I wonder if Fortunetellers are just really good guessers&quot; as I click a Google search link, and a large ad pops up for &quot;Fortunetelling Call This Number 10 dollars an hour blah blah&quot;, on fucking GameFAQs. A place you wouldn&#39;t expect a full screen pop up ad for a shady business like that. Today, I&#39;ve seen 3 different subs post an image on imgur that was a screenshot of Youtube and I got the video recommended afterwards out of nowhere. Literally something I would never watch and I meticulously try to train the recommendations AI by always clicking the Not Interested -button and then Tell Us Why.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I went to Italy last week as a vacation, I booked ahead some trains and hotels</p>

<p>turns out google makes reminders for all your flights, trains and hotel bookings based on your emails</p>

<p>it even auto downloads to cache the attached files of the mentioned emails </p>

<p>also also before my first flight I got a pop up notification, that Google maps can download maps for Rome and Florence, the exact places I would be visiting...</p>

<p>also also also, based on the prices of the places I went to eat at (I did a under 10E run on Rome and an over 20E at Florence) the restaurants that popped up on google maps changed to adjust </p>

<p>this while also asking for my reviews on everywhere I walked trought, mind you, I didn&#39;t have roaming so I just used location services, which are free everywhere.</p>

<p>this means google actively tracked my location even while &quot;offline&quot; and then uploaded and adjusted according to this recordings</p>

<p>and now I&#39;m getting a &quot;Set up your Google Assistant&quot; notification I cant get rid of</p>

<p>Was talking with my sister-in-law about our Halloween party last year.  Mention that we may need some &quot;dry ice&quot; for visual effects (while my phone is present).

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, I have had it happen.</p>

<p>I was talking to my wife about someone we know needing to remove a racoon from their attic, but we never googled it or typed it anywhere.  The next day and for a long time thereafter, I started seeing ads for &quot;critter removal services&quot; on various websites.</p>

<p>Coincidence?  It could be, and maybe I was just noticing those ads since we were recently talking about it, but it was still sort of freaky.</p>

<p>I have tried to reproduce it in a controlled experiment, but have been unable to do so.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>sure they have. its like people using Alexa, Siri, and stuff like this. Then complain that they are listening. Thats beyond stupid. Same as using facebook. You sign a contract when using services like these. And they say what they do right out in the TOS / EULA. Its a trade. So if you use their service you cant complain afterwards.

<p>its hard to take any complaints seriously</p>

<p>You only use smartphones, apps, services that don&#39;t require you to relinquish your rights?</p>

<p>My point being, there are very few if any choices in tech that will allow one to operate in a business capacity which is required for almost everyone while retaining one&#39;s right to privacy. There is no choice. FB, Twitter, Google, Instagram are just the most glaring instances of it all.  </p>

<p>You&#39;ve undoubtedly relinquished your rights to a TOS somewhere. That does not mean, nor should it mean that you just throw up your arms and accept your fate. If nothing else, complain about it. Take it a step farther and lobby against it. </p>
