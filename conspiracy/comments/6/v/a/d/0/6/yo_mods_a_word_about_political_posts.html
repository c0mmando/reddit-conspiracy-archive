<p>There is often no attempt to claim a connection to a conspiracy beyond vaguely invoking Soros, Russia, etc., which is overly simplistic and fails to move the conversation forward. There is even more often no accompanying text to explain why the post belongs here. </p>

<p>This is partly how this sub has become a right-left battleground. Thoughtless condemnation is not worthwhile conspiracy material. </p>

<p>Mods, you can help right the ship by requesting OPs provide at least some analysis in the initial post, and perhaps also that they refrain from purely politicized pandering for/against one side. </p>

<p>I for one will be reporting as spam posts that just provide links to news sites with click bait titles. I don&#39;t come here to read fucking headlines. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>u/sarah_connor claimed that there was a meeting between the mods discussing the shill / political spam problem in the sub.  Ever since then doesn&#39;t look like anything has been done about it other than contest mode not being used anymore, which in my opinion made things a LOT more honest.  If the shills and provocateurs can&#39;t abuse the voting system to manufacture support for their views, they become irrelevant, and the cream inevitably rises to the top.</p>

<p>On contest mode, I&#39;m not a huge fan of it unless it&#39;s applied with some sort of objective set of criteria, which I don&#39;t really think has been the case. </p>

<p>I&#39;d say it&#39;s more like the milk is shaken every time you open the bottle, and you have a random chance of cream ending up on top. In my mind, every post that was contest-moded became almost useless to try to follow any conversation, but it&#39;s not like the conversation wasn&#39;t already shit in those threads. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fair enough.  Perhaps in the future we can come up with a system to have a contest mode with a certain time limit to avoid the vote manipulation and brigading - it&#39;s the first day or two that&#39;s key two them getting control of the narrative in whatever thread they are infesting.  The whole point of shills is to gain traction by getting their ideas massively upvoted to the top of the page, implying general consent to their views, and pushing dissenting views all the way to the bottom - applying contest mode for, say, 24 hours on blatantly political posts from either side is a fundamentally easy way to avoid this if done correctly and as apolitical as possible.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve written about this in more detail before, but the basic idea is that  a shill accusation is almost impossible to defend against, even if the person is not a shill. Such accusation rarely offer any useful contribution to dialogue, and only seek to slide the conversation from the topic at hand to the discussion of who is or is not a shill.

<p>Most of the time I see the word used, or I myself feel inclined to use it, is only when I&#39;ve exhausted all available resources. I think they benefit more from creating an impasse in the argument, as it becomes open ended, there is no general consensus. </p>

<p>I know for a fact an echo chamber would be more conducive to affecting change in America. Conspiracy theories don&#39;t matter, details don&#39;t matter, they could all be wrong, and fake, it doesn&#39;t matter, what matters is in building general consensus that our government is evil and needs overthrown but without also getting rid of our Bill of Rights.</p>

<p>Do you see the school of thought I belong to, yet? Change, <strong>not accuracy.</strong> If everyone thought along these lines, we would have already overthrown them.</p>

<p>Truth and critical thinking are the only ways to defend against, or inoculate people against, propaganda. If someone believes your side of an argument only because you&#39;ve convinced them the other side is a shill, you&#39;ve not actually convinced them of your argument.  </p>

<p>Do you think you&#39;re ever going to get consensus on more than a handful of topics on a conspiracy board, and even then anything more than a vague &quot;the official 9/11 story is lie&quot; type of consensus? Would that even be desirable?</p>

<li>This just isn&#39;t true: the only way to defeat propaganda, is with more propaganda. That&#39;s it, and that&#39;s why we&#39;re losing, and will always lose. It&#39;s just too dynamic, and capable of changing it&#39;s argument it any moment. It has nothing it adheres to: only the desire to change minds. Compare that to the static, unchanging reality of truth. Propaganda is a chameleon, truth is a sloth. </li>
</ul>

<p>Clarity: We all use propaganda from time to time. When we use &quot;white lies&quot; that is propaganda. An example with regard to conspiracy theories would be: &quot;those had to have been explosions on 9/11.&quot; And while I agree, those were indeed explosions on that day, we just don&#39;t have the proof. When we engage in bias, one way, or the other, in order to change someones mind, we are a propagandists. The only difference is, we are using it as a force for good.</p>

<p>If your premise is correct, I think what you&#39;re advocating would eventuate ashes, unless you think that this single secret society will peacefully cede  the power they worked so hard to establish and maintain.

    <div class="md"><p>When considering the following speech from JFK, and the fact that he was assassinated...</p>

<p><em>can&#39;t see the forest through the trees</em></p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, ladies and gentlemen:</p>

<p>I appreciate very much your generous invitation to be here tonight.</p>

<p>You bear heavy responsibilities these days and an article I read some time ago reminded me of how particularly heavily the burdens of present day events bear upon your profession.</p>

<p><strong>You may remember that in 1851 the New York Herald Tribune under the sponsorship and publishing of Horace Greeley, employed as its London correspondent an obscure journalist by the name of Karl Marx.</strong></p>

<p>We are told that foreign correspondent Marx, stone broke, and with a family ill and undernourished, constantly appealed to Greeley and managing editor Charles Dana for an increase in his munificent salary of $5 per installment, a salary which he and Engels ungratefully labeled as the &quot;lousiest petty bourgeois cheating.&quot;</p>

<p>But when all his financial appeals were refused, Marx looked around for other means of livelihood and fame, eventually terminating his relationship with the Tribune and devoting his talents full time to the cause that would bequeath the world the seeds of Leninism, Stalinism, revolution and the cold war.
<strong>If only this capitalistic New York newspaper had treated him more kindly; if only Marx had remained a foreign correspondent, history might have been different.</strong> And I hope all publishers will bear this lesson in mind the next time they receive a poverty-stricken appeal for a small increase in the expense account from an obscure newspaper man.</p>

<p>I have selected as the title of my remarks tonight &quot;The President and the Press.&quot; Some may suggest that this would be more naturally worded &quot;The President Versus the Press.&quot; But those are not my sentiments tonight.</p>

<p>It is true, however, that when a well-known diplomat from another country demanded recently that our State Department repudiate certain newspaper attacks on his colleague it was unnecessary for us to reply that this Administration was not responsible for the press, for the press had already made it clear that it was not responsible for this Administration.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, my purpose here tonight is not to deliver the usual assault on the so-called one party press. On the contrary, in recent months I have rarely heard any complaints about political bias in the press except from a few Republicans. Nor is it my purpose tonight to discuss or defend the televising of Presidential press conferences. I think it is highly beneficial to have some 20,000,000 Americans regularly sit in on these conferences to observe, if I may say so, the incisive, the intelligent and the courteous qualities displayed by your Washington correspondents.</p>

<p>Nor, finally, are these remarks intended to examine the proper degree of privacy which the press should allow to any President and his family.
If in the last few months your White House reporters and photographers have been attending church services with regularity, that has surely done them no harm.</p>

<p>On the other hand, I realize that your staff and wire service photographers may be complaining that they do not enjoy the same green privileges at the local golf courses that they once did.</p>

<p>It is true that my predecessor did not object as I do to pictures of one&#39;s golfing skill in action. But neither on the other hand did he ever bean a Secret Service man.</p>

<p>My topic tonight is a more sober one of concern to publishers as well as editors.</p>

<p>I want to talk about our common responsibilities in the face of a common danger. The events of recent weeks may have helped to illuminate that challenge for some; but the dimensions of its threat have loomed large on the horizon for many years. Whatever our hopes may be for the future--for reducing this threat or living with it--there is no escaping either the gravity or the totality of its challenge to our survival and to our security--a challenge that confronts us in unaccustomed ways in every sphere of human activity.
This deadly challenge imposes upon our society two requirements of direct concern both to the press and to the President--two requirements that may seem almost contradictory in tone, but which must be reconciled and fulfilled if we are to meet this national peril. I refer, first, to the need for a far greater public information; and, second, to the need for far greater official secrecy.</p>

<p><strong>The very word &quot;secrecy&quot; is repugnant in a free and open society; and we are as a people inherently and historically opposed to secret societies, to secret oaths and to secret proceedings. We decided long ago that the dangers of excessive and unwarranted concealment of pertinent facts far outweighed the dangers which are cited to justify it. Even today, there is little value in opposing the threat of a closed society by imitating its arbitrary restrictions. Even today, there is little value in insuring the survival of our nation if our traditions do not survive with it. And there is very grave danger that an announced need for increased security will be seized upon by those anxious to expand its meaning to the very limits of official censorship and concealment. That I do not intend to permit to the extent that it is in my control. And no official of my Administration, whether his rank is high or low, civilian or military, should interpret my words here tonight as an excuse to censor the news, to stifle dissent, to cover up our mistakes or to withhold from the press and the public the facts they deserve to know.</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>The JFK speech? I don&#39;t really think he was calling out any specific secret societies in the speech, but was making a broader point to the newspaper publishers he was speaking to about what the press should and should not publish in the context of the cold war. </p>

<p>He was saying that, although the US was not in a declared war, there were certain things that the press should not print that could endanger national security, and was calling on them to respect that. He was also saying that he would not use the power of the executive to prevent them from publishing such things. I think his use of the idea of secret societies was to contrast the ideal of an open democratic society with that of the authoritarian USSR, which had no such compunctions with forcefully restricting what their press could publish. </p>

<p>Given the context, I don&#39;t think JFK was calling out secret societies within the US. The speech was delivered to a meeting of the press, not to the public as one would expect if he were actually trying to root out such societies. There was only one line in the whole speech about secret societies, and it&#39;s only used to characterize the American people&#39;s general distrust for them. It was not a focal point of the speech. </p>

<p>Nor do I think the speech was a major causal factor in his assassination. He delivered it in April &#39;61, 3 months after his inauguration and 2 1/2 years before his assassination. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re not stepping out of the box, and paying attention to the larger picture. He places too much emphasis on secret societies. What, are we supposed to assume that secret societies are causing the press to publish our war secrets? Even so...</p>

<p>Maybe that&#39;s what he is asserting. Maybe he&#39;s asserting the real power of the media. Maybe he&#39;s addressing the members of his secret society? Maybe this is his way of telling them: &quot;hey, cool it, it was fun to pretend but now I&#39;m president of the United States of America, and I take my job and my responsibilities very seriously&quot;???</p>

<p>Where was Cultural Marxism born? The Frankfurt School, Columbia University, USA.. America...</p>

<p>If you don&#39;t know by now, these are the people who created Critical Theory <a href="https://www.aect.org/edtech/ed1/pdf/09.pdf">https://www.aect.org/edtech/ed1/pdf/09.pdf</a></p>

<p>What is Critical Theory, you may ask?</p>

<p>Critical Theory examines negativity, and it&#39;s effects and outcomes (especially how it can form desirable outcomes with regard to cultural hegemony). A good example of this would be the Drug War: Critical Theory would examine what good has come of it. &#39;Good&#39; not in the sense of meaningless propaganda like, &#39;drugs r bad, mmm kay&#39;, but the genuine, real good that comes from negativity. For example, Critical Theory might come to the conclusion that the Drug War has helped create more awareness of cultural hegemony, class structure, bigotry, etc. You don&#39;t need to think on it very long or hard to see how it could be one of the most dangerous fields of study ever created. It could come up with stupid theories like: from chaos, assimilation, from assimilation, harmony.</p>

<p>It&#39;s also some of the most exhausting stuff in the world to study, so no one is doing it, except for the people who have figured out how to use it to their advantage. It&#39;s essentially the study of manipulation of societies- though I&#39;m certain people would disagree with my assertion. One mans theory, might just be someone elses framework. Take the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>&quot;Note that critical is not meant to indicate a theory that examines only the negative. Critical theories seek to reveal the contradictions, social inequalities, and dominances; to this extent they can be called negative. However, it might be more accurate to say that because critical theories run contrary to that which oppresses people, the theories usually are positive and hopeful.&quot;</li>
</ul>

<p>You could almost say it&#39;s the positivity of negativity. Yes, it&#39;s convoluted, and it was meant to be.</p>

<p>This is what JFK was warning us about, and this is why he places so much emphasis on secret societies, it&#39;s the beginning of the meat and potatoes of his speech, after setting the tone with Marx:</p>

<p>&quot;You may remember that in 1851 the New York Herald Tribune under the sponsorship and publishing of Horace Greeley, employed as its London correspondent an obscure journalist by the name of Karl Marx.</p>

<p>And then on to say:</p>

<p>&quot;If only this capitalistic New York newspaper had treated him more kindly; if only Marx had remained a foreign correspondent, history might have been different.&quot;</p>

<p>Now, keep that in mind, and watch this video: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sbR6vHXD1j0">Lee Harvey Oswald</a></p>

<p>Lots of information that the CIA killed him, too much, in fact. What tells us he was speaking about Cultural Marxism. Take the following statement:</p>

<p>&quot;Even today, there is little value in opposing the threat of a closed society by imitating its arbitrary restrictions. Even today, there is little value in insuring the survival of our nation if our traditions do not survive with it.&quot;</p>

<p>He was likely talking about American adopting Cultural Marxism through secret societies. He was talking to his cult members. Here, listen to the speech, and listen to their nervous laughs, as he accuses them outright, to their faces. You&#39;re right, he wasn&#39;t talking to the nation, he was talking to his cult, who are also the press. He was literally asking them for a distinction to be made, then, and there, between them, and him. He was asking their permission to govern. He was making a plea for America to keep its traditions and cultural values to the very same people in the room. A group of cowards. <a href="https://www.jfklibrary.org/Asset-Viewer/Archives/JFKWHA-025-001.aspx">https://www.jfklibrary.org/Asset-Viewer/Archives/JFKWHA-025-001.aspx</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eP6jDM6sXhA">Just look at the way the Secret Service agents are pulled off his car.</a> The guy on the right is so angry and confused, he&#39;s ready to quite his job! </p>

<p>JFK was a family man, and President of the country, in all likelihood, not as close to the cult. He simply miscalculated how invested these people were, and they killed him for it. Johnson and Ladybird were waiting in the wings, you should go check her funeral out- &quot;Texas Longhorn&quot; signs <strong>everywhere</strong>.</p>

<p>Too much emphasis? He refers to it only in one line, and even there obliquely in the context of contrasting the US&#39;s democratic society with the closed society of the USSR.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What, are we supposed to assume that secret societies are causing the press to publish our war secrets? Even so...
Maybe that&#39;s what he is asserting. Maybe he&#39;s asserting the real power of the media. Maybe he&#39;s addressing the members of his secret society?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are two (overt, at least) points in his speech: that the press should be mindful of what to print out of a concern for national security, and that he as president must prevent the executive from becoming a secretive organization. If he&#39;s addressing members of what you think this secret society must be, why would he be admonishing them to show restraint in what they publish? Are you claiming he needs to tell a secret society to be more secretive?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This is what JFK was warning us about, and this is why he places so much emphasis on secret societies, it&#39;s the beginning of the meat and potatoes of his speech, after setting the tone with Marx:</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I really think you&#39;re reading more into this than the speech itself allows. The entire first part of the speech was jocular, both in how he delivered it and how it was received. The laughter in the beginning of the speech is not nervous, but genuine. Kennedy didn&#39;t place undue emphasis on the secret societies, <em>you</em> are. </p>

<p>On the critical theory aspects of your comment, I don&#39;t doubt the importance of it in general or as a means of advancing certain ends, but your tying it in to this speech is tenuous. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>He was asking their permission to govern. He was making a plea for America to keep its traditions and cultural values, to the very same people in the room</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t see it that way at all. He was asking them not to divulge information that would hamper the US&#39; efforts against the Soviets, but it was the executive which he claimed must not close itself off from the public. He was saying it was the executive which must be restrained in its tendency toward secrecy if the country was to maintain its traditions and values as an open and democratic state. </p>

<p>On the CIA having him killed, I think there&#39;s a good chance they, or factions within, were almost certainly involved. I just don&#39;t see this speech as being an indication of that. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why do you think corruption is so prevalent? Conspiracy theories so wide and varied, and why do you think we&#39;re descending into anarchy? Why are we constantly at war? We do we apply anthropomorphic terms to mere systems of paper? Why are we always angry? Why do so many things elicit and emotional response from us? Why are we not taught history, and why is critical thinking no longer taught in schools? Why is Common Core a thing? Why is the Drug War a thing when it&#39;s been proven to target ethnic minorities with &quot;lawful&quot; consequences, and the dominate political group with addiction?</p>

<p>Why do we think there is a difference between whites and black, between Jews and Christians?</p>

<p>It is the application of duality where there was none. There is no conflict if there is no differences.</p>

<p>The human race does not regress organically, it only moves forward. Look at the incredible amount of regression we have experienced in all aspects of life. People are dumber (read any book you like from 100 years ago, and wallow in self pity for your lack of vocabulary), test scores are way down, there&#39;s less minority owned businesses than in the 70&#39;s, low income neighborhoods are prisons without walls, the smarter you are, the more likely you are to take drugs (intelligence filter), the brightest kids never make it through school (another intelligence filter: too compartmentalized, structured and oppressive which is the opposite knowledge), innocent people are in prison (drug users), inalienable rights aren&#39;t even a concept (government owns your body), it&#39;s hip to be anti-Constitutional (the new American radical).</p>

<p>Understanding aristocratic human rationalization is the key to it all. For thousands of years they have been justifying their reign over the planet and its people by using philosophy- and proficient they have grown.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I dont think they should be banned, but the mods should definitely clean up duplicate threads, look to see if the content actually matches the headline, and/or make megathreads on certain topics. It&#39;s pretty obvious when certain users are spamming links with either no new information or such little new information that it would be more easily discussed and summarized by one good article. </p>

<p>It&#39;s also pretty clear for that kind of submission that the commentors did not watch the youtube videos or even read the &quot;articles&quot;, which are often clickbait and seemingly bot-generated (they just pull info from other articles that have already been posted). Each new thread like that seems to just become yet another circlejerk. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well said. I completely agree about the problem of boiling everything down to either &quot;Russia!&quot; or &quot;Soros!&quot;. I feel like that&#39;s the only spectrum of the conversation that &quot;they&quot; want us to be having (well, and now &quot;Nazis!&quot; too). </p>

<p>I was saying this the other day to someone here, about how blaming everything on Soros is both lazy and wildly speculative considering there&#39;s so much information we don&#39;t have, along with information that is untrue or exaggerated. Soros is just one of the players in this global game for control, and we our doing ourselves a massive disservice by making him out to be the only villain that&#39;s against us. Exact same goes for Russia, North Korea, etc.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Remember that scapegoats are usually scapegoats because they are apart of the guilt of their group. There is a reason why Soros is seen as the devil incarnate by some. The guy fuels economic/political catastrophes for his own agendas.</p>

<p>The Russian narrative was spun by the neolibs/neocons to create a shadow over Trump&#39;s presidency, as well as to silence their critics and opponents. It was incredibly insidious and fucked up how it was all done. I will never forgive MSM for swallowing it hook line and sinker like they did. That was not an accident.</p>

<p>That being said, Putin is NOT a friend to anybody. Too many conspiracy folks think that somehow Putin is an ally. The fucker is a murdering, hoarding, greedy, evil monster. Russia does meddle in our politics, and it is getting worse with the massive funding in propaganda and counter propaganda by the US and Russia. Watching RT you can see it clear as day. They always focus on far left and far right fringe stuff, and target folks disillusioned by government. They aid third party candidates as well to try and throw the wrench in our machine. Fucking bastards. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh, no doubt. My point was more that if you (not <em>you</em>) think Soros is <em>the</em> puppetmaster pulling the strings, you&#39;ll naturally think anyone working against Soros must be on your side. Same goes with Russia, Zionists, Jesuits, or whomever you pick. It&#39;s that single-minded focus that can blind us from seeing that the enemy of our enemy is very likely not our friend.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know that our system doesn&#39;t need a wrench or two in it, though I agree it could be short-sighted to accept one from Putin thinking he has our best interests in mind. He doesn&#39;t even have his own people&#39;s interest in mind.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No you are exactly right, man. Sometimes the enemy&#39;s enemy is not your friend. It is important to keep a wide perspective of things looking from the outside in. Staves off the confirmation bias and misunderstood patterns.</p>

<p>I agree that our system needs a good wrench in it to shake things up.   I am worried now though that with the identity politics of right wing white identity groups and left wing SJW types that we are going to encounter more wrenches in the system than we can handle. </p>

<p>Yep, and more so than just being too many wrenches, the wrong wrenches. Having white and blacks or &quot;nazis&quot; and &quot;antifa&quot; at each others&#39; throats doesn&#39;t do anything to address the root concerns we collectively face as a people. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah that alt right march was one of the most depressing days of the year for me. I cannot support that kind of crap one bit. It was sad because it became a boon for the SJWs and MSM. That stupid march gave the SJWs the &quot;moral high ground&quot; they so desperately craved. Before the march, it was clear that leftist identity politics was starting to wear thin to the public. Then some people on the right had the bright idea to play identity politics on the right. Fucking racist bullshit on both sides. Madness. know what I mean?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know exactly what you mean. I don&#39;t know how much of a boon it will end up being in the long run for the SJW-types, and it&#39;s particularly worrying how many of them are advocating violence against their enemies as a response to speech, and labeling anyone  who supports the white supremacists&#39; right to speak and assemble as being Nazis themselves. </p>

<p>It&#39;s disappointing how surface-level and lacking in nuance the discussion has been. It&#39;s possible to think white supremacists are despicable AND argue for their rights to assemble, as protected under the first amendment. It&#39;s also possible to argue that antifa has a right to counter-protest AND condemn them for any violence they commit. So many people feel the need to pick a side, and frankly I think both sides are shit, and both sides have the right to speak and assemble. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m with you all the way. These ideologies relieve people of their individual responsibilities to their fellow men and women. These beliefs allow a person to live by simple parameters that frame everything around them in a easy to digest way. Thinking is brought to an absolute minimum, while sentimentality is encouraged. In short it is cult like on both sides and that does not bode well for everybody else. Usually people do not leave these kinds of things until something truly disturbing wakes them from slumber, or the leaders of the movement die. Anyways God be with you. Love the folks who post here.

    <div class="md"><p>I couldn&#39;t agree more. Which is why I&#39;m still on the fence about who&#39;s more dangerous overall, Putin or the people that control the UN. From what I&#39;ve gathered, it seems a lot like it&#39;s Putin (and Iran) vs the International Banksters that are trying to control the entire world. The few countries that have resisted them for so many years seem to perfectly coincide with the United States&#39; &quot;biggest enemies&quot;. </p>

<p>Idk, just seems like there&#39;s a lot more to the story than we are ever told from mainstream sources of any kind. What if the discussion has been framed to show Putin killing subversive journalists and politicians that work for the bankers as &quot;evil&quot;, and the way he set up their banking system to be against them as &quot;enriching himself off of his own people&quot;. His own people really seem to love him. Plus I&#39;ve heard the same said about Trump only wanting to enrich himself, which I don&#39;t really buy at all (there&#39;s better ways of doing it than going through the immense hassle of becoming President).</p>

<p>Again, I just don&#39;t trust our media to be able to give us the whole truth about anything, especially when they&#39;ve been running a decades long smear campaign which to this day is repeated ad nauseam everywhere we look. Something tells me there is way more to all this than most people understand.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The only reason I&#39;m defending him is because you misrepresented him in your comment. Everything else is irrelevant. I used to identify as a lefty. Then I realised that identity politics is bullshit and that picking one ideology like a sports team and going with it through thick and thin is silly, because any ideology or set of parameters you stick to regardless of the context limits your potential for positive societal and individual evolution. I&#39;m not following you by the way, if it may appear that way, but just replying to your comments in this post where I&#39;ve seen you mention the right wing without the left. I&#39;m not saying that corruption on the right doesn&#39;t happen - as a matter of fact it&#39;s quite obvious, that&#39;s why I&#39;m less concerned about that than I am corruption on the left - but rather pointing out that corruption in the left does happen and that it&#39;s more dangerous at this time than corruption on the right, because the people (regular people, and I&#39;m speaking generally here) are falling for the mainstream left&#39;s ideologies as genuine when we&#39;ve seen in the past that it&#39;s a lie. Carrot and stick policies. The war never ends regardless of who&#39;s the face for the government.

<p>No it doesn&#39;t. You can disagree with someone&#39;s politics while still thinking it&#39;s weird to mod conspiracy and support the_donald. The two subs are essentially polar opposites. One stands for questioning the government and the other stands for blind allegiance to it. </p>

<p>help user spam?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As long as the internet, there will be spam.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Or unsourced claims?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>...a sub for fun speculation about conspiracy theories. </p>

<p>In my experience, dramatic and unsourced claims get routinely called out. Legitimate <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> users are extremely well-versed in the difference uses of logical fallacies. It&#39;s better for the edification of the community to not have to defer to moderators every time someone makes an unsubstantiated claim. Downvote and/or rebut, tag them if that&#39;s your thing, and move on to the next.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Or forum sliding?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s a legitimate concern.</p>

<p>One of the most egregious examples of this is when the top 5 or so upvoted comments are different iterations of statements like &quot;where&#39;s the conspiracy?&quot; or &quot;why is this in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>?&quot;</p>

<p>In an attempt to de-legitimize our ability to discuss what we won&#39;t, &quot;they&quot; employ this tactic in the hope that newer users forget (or don&#39;t even read) the sidebar:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a forum for free thinking and discussing issues which have captured the public’s imagination. Please respect other views and opinions, and keep an open mind.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here&#39;s what the sidebar <em>doesn&#39;t</em> say:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a forum only for topics that every user, regardless of their affiliation with the sub, has to unanimously agree falls into the category of &quot;conspiracy theory&quot; and if not, then all legitimate discourse on these topics will be stifled by forcing our users to sift through dozens of substance-less complaints.</p>

<p>that Soros is the ultimate evil in the world?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If people want to call Soros silly names let them. Why on earth would you want us to censor/stop them? It flies in the face of what this sub represents. </p>

<p>I think it&#39;s arguable that there&#39;s more propaganda being posted here these days than anything conspiracy related. And then people get shit on and called shill for pointing out that its just propaganda!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You will find that lots of libertarian minded folks are big fixtures in the conspiracy world. Lots of these types sadly have gotten snared up into right wing identity politics thinking they have to fight fire with fire on the left. You see so much opposition to the normie mainstream take on things because MSM is a controlled neolib/neocon operation. Not all the reports of Antifa violence were fake, and Antifa is notorious for pulling sneaky shit when the cameras are not around, and using, well, shall we say &quot;novel&quot; ways of attacking and harrassing their opponents.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This has already been discussed, and I am sure the mods are perfectly aware. I do not like these kinds of threads. They give me the vibe of somebody that wants to cut away at the free exchange of ideas. </p>

<p>People should be able to post their thoughts and ideas concerning conspiracies that cannot be backed up with any relevant data. I have posted on meaningful and pretty awesome threads where it was just riffing on certain ideas made by the original poster, without  any sort of clarification. Leave it be, man! I would rather have a bunch of shitty threads of all sorts than to even remotely curtail a decent thread from being made for lack of sourcing and definition. </p>

    <div class="md"><p><strong>Explain this speech, and I&#39;ll never post in r/Conspiracy again.</strong></p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, ladies and gentlemen:</p>

<p>I appreciate very much your generous invitation to be here tonight.</p>

<p>You bear heavy responsibilities these days and an article I read some time ago reminded me of how particularly heavily the burdens of present day events bear upon your profession.</p>

<p><strong>You may remember that in 1851 the New York Herald Tribune under the sponsorship and publishing of Horace Greeley, employed as its London correspondent an obscure journalist by the name of Karl Marx.</strong></p>

<p>We are told that foreign correspondent Marx, stone broke, and with a family ill and undernourished, constantly appealed to Greeley and managing editor Charles Dana for an increase in his munificent salary of $5 per installment, a salary which he and Engels ungratefully labeled as the &quot;lousiest petty bourgeois cheating.&quot;</p>

<p>But when all his financial appeals were refused, Marx looked around for other means of livelihood and fame, eventually terminating his relationship with the Tribune and devoting his talents full time to the cause that would bequeath the world the seeds of Leninism, Stalinism, revolution and the cold war.
<strong>If only this capitalistic New York newspaper had treated him more kindly; if only Marx had remained a foreign correspondent, history might have been different.</strong> And I hope all publishers will bear this lesson in mind the next time they receive a poverty-stricken appeal for a small increase in the expense account from an obscure newspaper man.</p>

<p>I have selected as the title of my remarks tonight &quot;The President and the Press.&quot; Some may suggest that this would be more naturally worded &quot;The President Versus the Press.&quot; But those are not my sentiments tonight.</p>

<p>It is true, however, that when a well-known diplomat from another country demanded recently that our State Department repudiate certain newspaper attacks on his colleague it was unnecessary for us to reply that this Administration was not responsible for the press, for the press had already made it clear that it was not responsible for this Administration.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, my purpose here tonight is not to deliver the usual assault on the so-called one party press. On the contrary, in recent months I have rarely heard any complaints about political bias in the press except from a few Republicans. Nor is it my purpose tonight to discuss or defend the televising of Presidential press conferences. I think it is highly beneficial to have some 20,000,000 Americans regularly sit in on these conferences to observe, if I may say so, the incisive, the intelligent and the courteous qualities displayed by your Washington correspondents.</p>

<p>Nor, finally, are these remarks intended to examine the proper degree of privacy which the press should allow to any President and his family.
If in the last few months your White House reporters and photographers have been attending church services with regularity, that has surely done them no harm.</p>

<p>On the other hand, I realize that your staff and wire service photographers may be complaining that they do not enjoy the same green privileges at the local golf courses that they once did.</p>

<p>It is true that my predecessor did not object as I do to pictures of one&#39;s golfing skill in action. But neither on the other hand did he ever bean a Secret Service man.</p>

<p>My topic tonight is a more sober one of concern to publishers as well as editors.</p>

<p>I want to talk about our common responsibilities in the face of a common danger. The events of recent weeks may have helped to illuminate that challenge for some; but the dimensions of its threat have loomed large on the horizon for many years. Whatever our hopes may be for the future--for reducing this threat or living with it--there is no escaping either the gravity or the totality of its challenge to our survival and to our security--a challenge that confronts us in unaccustomed ways in every sphere of human activity.
This deadly challenge imposes upon our society two requirements of direct concern both to the press and to the President--two requirements that may seem almost contradictory in tone, but which must be reconciled and fulfilled if we are to meet this national peril. I refer, first, to the need for a far greater public information; and, second, to the need for far greater official secrecy.</p>

<p><strong>The very word &quot;secrecy&quot; is repugnant in a free and open society; and we are as a people inherently and historically opposed to secret societies, to secret oaths and to secret proceedings. We decided long ago that the dangers of excessive and unwarranted concealment of pertinent facts far outweighed the dangers which are cited to justify it. Even today, there is little value in opposing the threat of a closed society by imitating its arbitrary restrictions. Even today, there is little value in insuring the survival of our nation if our traditions do not survive with it. And there is very grave danger that an announced need for increased security will be seized upon by those anxious to expand its meaning to the very limits of official censorship and concealment. That I do not intend to permit to the extent that it is in my control. And no official of my Administration, whether his rank is high or low, civilian or military, should interpret my words here tonight as an excuse to censor the news, to stifle dissent, to cover up our mistakes or to withhold from the press and the public the facts they deserve to know.</strong></p>
