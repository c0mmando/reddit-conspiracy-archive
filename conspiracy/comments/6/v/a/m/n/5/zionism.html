    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for the downvotes, but that doesn&#39;t answer the question, which I was asking OP.  Why are so many &quot;white guys&quot; zealously pursuing the old prophesies of a tiny, middle eastern country that didn&#39;t even exist, and they themselves had to artificially create?  It seems like an odd thing for Europeans to pursue.</p>

<p>I believe his username hints at the answer, but instead of an answer, I get downvotes.  Interesting...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why are so many white guys zealously pursuing the land, resources, control and power that comes from control of all that land and resources in The Middle East?  Gosh, I don&#39;t know!  Why does that tiny country keep growing?  Gosh, I don&#39;t know!  Why do the Europeans who live there keep doing everything they can to drive away the Arabs who live there?

    <div class="md"><p>You said &quot;I don&#39;t know&quot; three times.  &quot;I don&#39;t know&quot; what prompted your hostile tone, but why don&#39;t you just say what you mean, instead of picking a fight with a question that appears to offend you?</p>

<p>Hell, if it offends people so much, I wasn&#39;t even asking you.  The question was for OP.  And your claim, which you apparently &quot;don&#39;t know&quot;, doesn&#39;t explain why a religious zealotry would be needed, to create a country for a specific subset minority of the population, to live on the least lucrative plot of land in the middle East.  If it was just to steal resources, they would&#39;ve moved into S.A., Iraq, Kuwait, etc.</p>

<p>If you can actually figure out why &quot;white&quot; Europeans serve &quot;Jewish&quot; interests, you&#39;ll figure out what&#39;s driven Western Civilization, from ancient times.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Holy Roman royal families like the House of Windsor were ancient Babylonian royalty. The Black Nobility were mostly Assyrian and Persian nobility. In my opinion Zionism is about dominance over Jerusalem which is considered a holy land by Jews, Christians, and Muslims. The Vatican has major influences over Jerusalem today. Zion originally refers to a mountain in Jerusalem that symbolizes a military stronghold. Sion is a name of a city in Switzerland right near the Haut de Cry mountains. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you.  I always like your answers, even if they&#39;re <em>slightly</em> off from what I&#39;d say.</p>

<p>I&#39;d say that their Babylonian stint was more of a brief footnote in their history, and that their primary history (as far as I can trace) weaves more through Sumer, then Egypt.  They infiltrated Egypt via a (somewhat fictionalized) Abraham, ruled for awhile over lower Egypt, were kicked out to the east side of the Nile delta/Canaan/Greece, and ruled from Tanis and other &quot;Jewish&quot; outposts until Babylon came along.</p>

<p>How&#39;s that? The Vatican flag has 2 keys and Swiss uses the First Aid Kit.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Court Jews and Zionists serve courts of the royal families.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yet it seems like the Zionists are running the world and the British Crown and Vatican have been subverted by Zionism. Jewish Hollywood produces a series of Jesuit-themed thrillers, but you&#39;ll never see a Zionist one. Why is that?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not bad at all.  But what if Britain was never subverted?  What if its rulers have the same heritage as these middle eastern people?  And no, I&#39;m not talking strictly &quot;Jewish.&quot;. It&#39;d be closer to Sumerian, or Egyptian, than Jewish.  But I prefer the original name Hyksos.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t have a specific British/Jewish link handy, but here is one that gets closest to the issue.  That Greek and jewgyptian history are intertwined to the point of being inseparable.  This then branches into Roman history, the Catholic Church, the dark ages/feudalism, the British empire, NATO, up to the more modern notions of Zionism.</p>

<p>It&#39;s more than just a fast, casual read, but for people interested in the subject, <a href="http://www.haaretz.com/jewish/archaeology/1.756385">this article from Haaretz</a> dances close to the truth, without even realizing it.  Pay attention in particular to their mentions of Egypt.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The United States is defined as a federal corporation under US code 3002 section 15. The Virginia Company was turned into the United States during the Revolutionary War by the Freemasonic Founding Fathers who were serving the Grand Lodge of England. The Virginia Company was issued by the British royal family from the City of London Corporation for North American settlements. In 1213 King John surrendered the Kingdom of England to the Holy See under the Golden Bull. In 1215 under direct papal authority King John issued the Magna Carta (Latin for Great Charter) and that established the one mile square block called the City of London Corporation as a sovereign entity from England and London. The Holy See uses Latin for official documents and the Vatican uses Latin as its official language. Novus Ordo Seclorum is Latin and translates to New Order of the Ages and is on the United States Great Seal and United States one dollar bill. Washington DC is located in both Virginia and Maryland. That is Virgin Mary Land. DC was originally called Rome in 1669 which is stated in the Catholic Encyclopedia. DC is Roman architecture and Capitol Hill is named after Capitoline Hill in Rome. The ancient Roman fasces symbol is all over federal buildings and federal seals. The federal government is based on the Roman Republic which was a fascist empire.</p>
