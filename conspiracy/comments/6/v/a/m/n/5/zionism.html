       The British Crown established Israel after it seized Palestine during WWI and through its migration contracts under the British law of "Mandatory Palestine" with the World Zionist Organization that was headed up by French and Swiss Zionists. Napoleon Bonaparte was the first political Zionist who proclaimed for all Jews to settle in Jerusalem. It is the Roman Catholic King of Spain that holds the official title of "King of Jerusalem". Court Jews and Zionists serve courts of the royal families. Buckingham palace is a royal court and the British Rothschild family serves the House of Windsor. Stockholm Palace is a royal court and the very wealthy Wallenberg family serve the House of Bernadotte. Jesuits are Roman intelligence and serve the Black Nobility which own the Vatican, Holy See, Society of Jesus, SMOM, KOC, and Italian Mafia. They also run Switzerland and that is why the Swiss guard protects the Vatican City State today. The Vatican and Switzerland are the only two nations on the planet that use the square shaped flag. The Black Nobility are the top of the New World Order agenda. The Vatican uses Latin for official documents. Novus Ordo Seclorum is on the United States great seal and US dollar and translates to New Order of the Ages. The Holy See is the All Seeing Eye.

       Here in the USA, and in Britain &amp; elsewhere, Jews are white, Zionist Jews are white, and Zionist non-Jews are white.  Zionism is a club.

       If your boss is a Zionist, and you are not a Zionist, but if you have Zionist co-workers, you should expect that your next boss will also be a Zionist, and so will many of your future co-workers.

       Thanks for the downvotes, but that doesn't answer the question, which I was asking OP.  Why are so many "white guys" zealously pursuing the old prophesies of a tiny, middle eastern country that didn't even exist, and they themselves had to artificially create?  It seems like an odd thing for Europeans to pursue.

       I believe his username hints at the answer, but instead of an answer, I get downvotes.  Interesting...

       Why are so many white guys zealously pursuing the land, resources, control and power that comes from control of all that land and resources in The Middle East?  Gosh, I don't know!  Why does that tiny country keep growing?  Gosh, I don't know!  Why do the Europeans who live there keep doing everything they can to drive away the Arabs who live there?  Gosh, I don't know!

       You said "I don't know" three times.  "I don't know" what prompted your hostile tone, but why don't you just say what you mean, instead of picking a fight with a question that appears to offend you?
      </p>
      <p>
       Hell, if it offends people so much, I wasn't even asking you.  The question was for OP.  And your claim, which you apparently "don't know", doesn't explain why a religious zealotry would be needed, to create a country for a specific subset minority of the population, to live on the least lucrative plot of land in the middle East.  If it was just to steal resources, they would've moved into S.A., Iraq, Kuwait, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you can actually figure out why "white" Europeans serve "Jewish" interests, you'll figure out what's driven Western Civilization, from ancient times.

       I think the "jewish" population living in Israel was moved/expelled there to create a boiling pot. That leads to a large population with a we vs. you psychosis
       <em>
        owned
       </em>
       by the international "jewish" banker families.

       The Holy Roman royal families like the House of Windsor were ancient Babylonian royalty. The Black Nobility were mostly Assyrian and Persian nobility. In my opinion Zionism is about dominance over Jerusalem which is considered a holy land by Jews, Christians, and Muslims. The Vatican has major influences over Jerusalem today. Zion originally refers to a mountain in Jerusalem that symbolizes a military stronghold. Sion is a name of a city in Switzerland right near the Haut de Cry mountains.

       Thank you.  I always like your answers, even if they're
       <em>

       I'd say that their Babylonian stint was more of a brief footnote in their history, and that their primary history (as far as I can trace) weaves more through Sumer, then Egypt.  They infiltrated Egypt via a (somewhat fictionalized) Abraham, ruled for awhile over lower Egypt, were kicked out to the east side of the Nile delta/Canaan/Greece, and ruled from Tanis and other "Jewish" outposts until Babylon came along.

       How's that? The Vatican flag has 2 keys and Swiss uses the First Aid Kit.

       Yet it seems like the Zionists are running the world and the British Crown and Vatican have been subverted by Zionism. Jewish Hollywood produces a series of Jesuit-themed thrillers, but you'll never see a Zionist one. Why is that?

       Not bad at all.  But what if Britain was never subverted?  What if its rulers have the same heritage as these middle eastern people?  And no, I'm not talking strictly "Jewish.". It'd be closer to Sumerian, or Egyptian, than Jewish.  But I prefer the original name Hyksos.

       I don't have a specific British/Jewish link handy, but here is one that gets closest to the issue.  That Greek and jewgyptian history are intertwined to the point of being inseparable.  This then branches into Roman history, the Catholic Church, the dark ages/feudalism, the British empire, NATO, up to the more modern notions of Zionism.

       The United States is defined as a federal corporation under US code 3002 section 15. The Virginia Company was turned into the United States during the Revolutionary War by the Freemasonic Founding Fathers who were serving the Grand Lodge of England. The Virginia Company was issued by the British royal family from the City of London Corporation for North American settlements. In 1213 King John surrendered the Kingdom of England to the Holy See under the Golden Bull. In 1215 under direct papal authority King John issued the Magna Carta (Latin for Great Charter) and that established the one mile square block called the City of London Corporation as a sovereign entity from England and London. The Holy See uses Latin for official documents and the Vatican uses Latin as its official language. Novus Ordo Seclorum is Latin and translates to New Order of the Ages and is on the United States Great Seal and United States one dollar bill. Washington DC is located in both Virginia and Maryland. That is Virgin Mary Land. DC was originally called Rome in 1669 which is stated in the Catholic Encyclopedia. DC is Roman architecture and Capitol Hill is named after Capitoline Hill in Rome. The ancient Roman fasces symbol is all over federal buildings and federal seals. The federal government is based on the Roman Republic which was a fascist empire.

       I have no idea what he means by Jesuit-themed thrillers. Hollywood which has a lot of productions companies owned or managed by Jews which are serving the royal families tend to produce a lot of Italian gangster films and pro Vatican propaganda.

       Can you go more in detail in this? It is commonly accepted that the Freemasons/Illumanti work for the Roths, but it seems the Founding Fathers (for the most part) were at odds with the Roths. Am I missing something here?

       Freemasons operate under the Grand Lodges. The top lodges are the Grand Lodge of Scotland and Grand Lodge of England and both of these are ran by the peerage under the authority of the British Crown. Most of the Founding Fathers were Freemasons and were false opposition. They helped to transform the Virginia Company into the United States which is defined as a federal corporation.

       The British Crown established Israel after it seized Palestine during WWI and through its migration contracts under the British law of "Mandatory Palestine" with the World Zionist Organization that was headed up by French and Swiss Zionists like the French Rothschild family which are presently intermarried with the Aldobrandini family of Rome. The Rothschild family are vaguely mentioned as the "guardians of the papal treasure" in the Jewish Encyclopedia. Guards are not above owners. Napoleon Bonaparte was the first political Zionist who proclaimed for all Jews to settle in Jerusalem. It is the Roman Catholic King of Spain that holds the official title of "King of Jerusalem". Court Jews and Zionists serve courts of the royal families. Buckingham palace is a royal court and the British Rothschild family serves the House of Windsor. The French Rothschild family serve the Roman Curia the papal court. Stockholm Palace is a royal court and the very wealthy Wallenberg family serve the House of Bernadotte. Jesuits are Roman intelligence and serve the Black Nobility which own the Vatican, Holy See, Society of Jesus, SMOM, KOC, and Italian Mafia. They also run Switzerland and that is why the Swiss guard protects the Vatican City State today. Banking in Switzerland is private. Banking in Israel is not private. The Vatican and Switzerland are the only two nations on the planet that use the square shaped flag. The Black Nobility are the top of the New World Order agenda. The Vatican uses Latin for official documents. Novus Ordo Seclorum is on the United States great seal and US dollar and translates to New Order of the Ages. The Holy See is the All Seeing Eye. Some evil Jewish banking and merchant families include the Rothschild, Goldsmith, Montagu, Sassoon, Dreyfus, Wallenberg, Walton, and Warburg families. None of them are above royalty.

       Zionism has a distinctly Jewish heritage.  Yet it has a bunch of Anglo/European interests pursuing it.  Why do you think that is?
