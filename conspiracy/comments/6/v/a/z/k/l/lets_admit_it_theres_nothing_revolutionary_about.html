       After campaigning on ending nation building he has just committed to doing just that in Afghanistan. After 16 years of failed nation building all we are doing at this point is keeping money flowing into the hands of military contractors. If you think his rhetoric on immigration was revolutionary I am sorry to say there will be no wall or mass deportations. If you think his rhetoric on trade was revolutionary I'm sorry to say he has not the leverage or will to do anything dramatic. Trump is an opportunist that will pander to the people but serve the elite like everyone before him.

       Yes, it's time to overthrow the government and end the entire system.  If it's Trump that rallies people to do this, that's a good thing, but I fear that most anti-Trump people think that the Democrats are somehow better.

       Correct, I'm an anarchist. I believe all services can be privatized. This will allow accountability for things as a result. Like if the cops are not protecting you or your property in the appropriate way, then you stop paying them and hire a different company.

       Are you suggesting that McDonalds controls my life? I disagree, because I get a choice about whether I eat at McDonalds or if I cook at home. I don't get that choice with the cops, the fire department or the schools.

       You're repeating yourself. The part you're not getting is that private services compete against one another, whereas government services are one size fit all. Accountability requires that we can leave one service provider and goto another.

       You can have moderately peaceful revolutions when the whole nation gets behind overthrowing the government. The fall of the USSR, and all the related Colour revolutions are perfect examples. One of the issues is that the US government has done a great job of dividing people into increasingly polar groups such that no one can unify the nation against them.

       Never going to happen.  Even before the current climate of insane partisanship, more than half the people think the government had their best interests at heart and have a basic level of trust in their institutions and the President, despite all evidence to the contrary.

       He's not wrong whatsoever.  We haven't been an actual constitutional republic since 1871 and the Organic Act.  We are a fraudulent, bankrupted Corporation owned by London and the Vatican, being propped up by fiat funny money and run by the criminal cartels themselves, given the false veneer of respectability and authority.  Time to go, the entire thing needs to be gutted and rededicated to the original precepts of the Constitution it was founded upon.

       Why should I have to explain that our government needs to go back to a strictly constitutional form of governance without all the extra bullshit meant to destroy the political power of the people (i.e., US) that are supposed to be running it?  We were a constitutional republic at one point, and now we are not.  This needs to change.  Very simple.

       If you're going by strict interpretations of the original Constitution, it's pretty simple.  I don't fuck with you don't fuck with me, government should have as small a role possible to defend the country and enforce contracts and the like, no law should be passed infringing upon people's Free Will and inherent personal freedoms so long as they don't harm anybody.  There's plenty of room for wiggling and to go over the minutiae, so long as the original principal and intent of the Constitution is followed.

       Of course there needs to be some regulations to protect the general welfare of the people, but that's less important than the actual framework and inner workings of the government itself, which is highly flawed and full of corruption that needs to be excised.

       You should probably asking yourself why in any way you would trust Mueller, the guy who basically was the architect of the 9/11 cover-up during the Bush Administration.  He is a Deep State operative, globalist and one of the worst of the swamp dwellers, and his close friendship with James Comey should have recused him from the investigation for conflicts of interest right off the bat.  But we can't have
       <em>
        that
       </em>
       , got to continue the witch hunt!  Let's ignore that it is on the surface a thinly-veiled attempt by ideologues to impeach and throw out a democratically-elected president with the help of the unelected fascists in the bureaucracy, right?

       You should also be skeptical of a billionare posing as a "blue color billionare" who has a vested interest to become president so he can enrich himself and his friends. Who has as in his campaign a self admitted dirty trickster who was involved in watergate (roger stone), paul manafort who has a long record of working to promote russian interests in ukraine and america, who has filled his cabinet with lobbyists and bankers from alle the companies who created the finacial collapse of 2008, and the list goes on and on and on...

       Just because I like some of Trump's policies doesn't mean I actually trust him or fully support him.  Learn how to make distinctions.  I can be in favor of anti-globalist policy that Trump enacts and still hate his militarism or his ass-kissing towards Israel, for example.  I don't think a single person that voted for Trump even did it because they
       <em>
        trust

       him, let's be serious here.  Nobody's letting him watch their kids.

       Why do you think that perceived enemies pop up out of nowhere with their panties in a bunch wanting to fuck this country up?  Everything happens for a reason and all of this is manufactured to create consent for agendas that they already have in mind.  That's why I kind of laugh when people think a guy like Kim Jong-un, a multi-millionaire that was raised and schooled in the very best Swiss schools money can buy, is a crazy person and doesn't know what he's doing.  Those people are missing the point of the entire charade.

       Out of nowhere? See this is one of the major problems I have with people like you. None of these are recent problems; they have simply become the largest "public enemy" as others disappear or lessen. ISIS is not new, and neither are their ideals. Our issues with Russia go back decade after decade. Korea has been fighting the entire world tooth and nail for a very long time as well. Being taught at a fancy school does not solve personal or metal issues, or lessen the sense of power and greed a world leader commands.
      </p>
      <p>
       Things are not as black and white as you seem to portray them. At the end of the day, we're a huge country in an even larger and more complex world. There are hundreds of issues out there, and we're allowed to be concerned about more than one of them at a time.

       You misunderstand my point.  A lot of this is theater, in fact most of it is theater.  I choose not to live a life where I live in constant worry of getting the shit bombed out of us by some dirt poor third world country that's going to invite suicide by attacking us, even if it doesn't even have the technological ability to strike us, like NK.  But I'll tackle your points one by one:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         ISIS is just about destroyed and on its last legs, thanks to Russia, Syria, Iran and the Kurds destroying them in Syria and Iraq, along with Trump defunding ISIS through the CIA.  They were always a boogeyman to begin with, just like Al-Qaeda, because they are ultimately funded by our own intelligence agencies in the first place and just a proxy front.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Russia is not a threat to us in any real definition of the word.  They're not trying to destroy the country, they haven't attacked us ever, Vladimir Putin has repeatedly called for cooperation and friendship (as has Donald Trump), and both sides are fully aware that if it escalates it could destroy the entire planet if left unchecked.  Neither side wants that not even the Elite, because they don't want to rule over piles of ash.  Basic spycraft between nations that they all do all the time are not Declarations of War.  In other words stop buying into the media propaganda trying to paint Russia as the Great Satan to American interests because it's a bunch of bullshit meant to scare the plebs into accepting increasingly Draconian laws to "protect them", just like it was during the Cold War.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         North Korea has been fighting the world "tooth and nail" by basically not accepting Rothschild and central banking influence in their country, and that's really the only reason.  Well, that and they're sitting on trillions of dollars of conflict minerals, but I bet that has
         <em>
          nothing
         </em>
         to do with the propaganda used against them, right?  I'm not defending Kim Jong on in the sense that I'm sure he's a despot and an autocratic bastard, but we have no problem with autocratic bastards so long as they work for us.  Just look at Saudi Arabia, Iran under the Shah, Augusto Pinochet in Chile, or Iraq during the Saddam regime in the 80s, I could go on forever.  Point being the US stance towards North Korea is incredibly hypocritical and driven by greed and strategic dominance, not feels or pity or altruism towards the North Koreans themselves.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Still think I think in black and white?  There's nothing wrong with having healthy concern for regimes that might go rogue and crazy, but what we're seeing is a massive propaganda effort to push Americans into wars that the are not in their interests that are only going to benefit the top 1% and the military industrial complex.  It has nothing to do with our safety, and almost never does.

       Yes, at least partly because poor people don't believe it's
       <em>
        possible
       </em>
       for politicians to represent them and thus don't bother trying to get one who does.

       So the way to solve exploitation is for the people being exploited to stop being exploited?
      </p>
      <p>
       If poor people are conscious enough regarding todays system, then 1) voting would be made illegal and 2) they wouldn't need to accomplish their goals through government in the first place.

       I'm not sure what "the way to solve exploitation" is, but I do think that if the people being exploited were to stop either A, rabidly supporting their own exploitation, or B, rabidly insisting that there is no difference between exploitation and non-exploitation, then that might be a good starting point.

       Now you're moving the goalpost.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        privatized health care = this means less tax money, not more. Government healthcare means more money being taken from you
       </li>
       <li>
        lower taxes on the rich = rich or poor, the issue is them taking money from people. You're not disputing that they take money at this point
       </li>
       <li>
        decreased financial regulation = not really part of the issue of taxation
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       I guess it's clear now that you like it when the government takes money from people other than yourself. I suppose you're not so much looking for fairness, as you are for your side winning.

       Obama has been in office for the past 8 years. There are numerous taxes that the left wants to impose upon me that can not be shouldered solely by the rich alone (e.g. carbon taxes). Obamacare alone is leftist program and it has raised peoples expenses on the basis that it's a tax (according to the surpreme court).

       That's the comment I replied to. I didn't see any arguements. And the rare earth's have been a target for a long time. Afghanistan has the largest reserves of rare earths on the planet besides China's reserves. The US government has been drooling over it for decades.

       I agree that you also responded with a straw man. The true straw man in this post is the notion that the new troop surge indicates a pro-war agenda from Trump, which neglects the possibility that this is the best strategy to end war in that nation. As in, it may be strategically awful to cut and run right now, so he may have decided to apply pressure to restore order so that American soldiers can safely leave without ISIS taking over everything.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's reasonable to suggest that this is not the case and that Trump is a war monger. But it's just a suggestion, not a fact. That is the straw man that everyone is dancing around in this thread, although few will be honest about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       We have to remember that Trump became president in a war-torn world. This was somewhat true of Obama too, although his actions belied a clear strategy against the interests of the American people. Now we see how Trump's strategy plays out. Ultimately I think this slow-motion train wreck towards WWIII will be significantly reversed by 2020. But that is just my opinion.

       The only true way to end war in Afghanistan is to clean house and build it up like they did to Germany and Japan after WW2. With a stable economy and lifting the country out of extreme poverty folks will not want to give it up.

      <p>
       Except that's literally a war crime.  I'm not saying it couldn't be obfuscated with red tape, but it's not as simple as you're making it out.  Plenty of nations would have motivation to call out a war crime of that magnitude when it starts infringing on their own mineral profits.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm also not convinced there's enough there to be profitable.  You're dealing against established competition who are not having to operate under duress, and there's no known minerals there in sufficient quantities that have particular strategic or economic value.

       The private firms did just that in Iraq. They definitely can get away with it, maybe it would be more difficult now but I doubt it. 
I think it's safe to say there are resources to be exploited in Afghanistan but the real ROI is probably too low to make it worthwhile. The infrastructure needs to be in place to actually get to those remote areas. But that's also part of the nation building exercise - making roads etc.

       I don't know how seriously the US would take other countries calling them out on a war crime they purposely did in order for mass profits.
      </p>
      <p>
       It isn't like if the US got called out for a war crime over that, suddenly there would be some kind of "problem?" Trump would laugh and turn it around, then shoot up 100 distractions so nobody mentions it again. It. Keeps. Working.

       Afghanistan has similar things happening, but because they have the poppy that takes a backseat. Plenty of illegal mining on an artisanal scale goes on there and gets 'taxed' by the Taliban in the same way they tax other industries there. It's the Taliban who ok'd the Chinese to press on with copper mining plans.
      </p>
      <p>
       But nothing large scale can happen with the Taliban able to pop up anywhere to disrupt any part of operations.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the Congo there was much more control of territory, there wasn't the threat of insurgency everywhere. And money talked, so when mining companies were able to get involved they just paid their way. No religious/idealogical threat.

        In 2006, a U.S. Geological Survey estimated that Afghanistan has as much as 36 trillion cubic feet (1.0×1012 m3) of natural gas, 3.6 billion barrels (570×106 m3) of oil and condensate reserves. According to a 2007 assessment, Afghanistan has significant amounts of undiscovered non-fuel mineral resources.

       Yep. Every war the US has launched since Desert Storm has been about oil. It's the core of their foreign and national security policy. I like to think that the CIA really wanted the poppy fields back up and running, come on, it's always about oil.

       My brother served 3 times in Iraq and 3 more times in Afghanistan. He used to be Mr. Patriot, but now he is just a super depressed ex-special forces guy who suffers from all his experiences there and talks nonstop about how he can't wait to move to Finland. Now he hates the USGov absolutely. The change in him is uncanny.

       He made friends with several Finnish special forces guys and they spoke a lot about things there.
      </p>
      <p>
       He hasn't moved yet. After he was officially diagnosed with PTSD and severe depression, about two months ago, he said is now receiving $10,000 a month, can no longer own a gun, and is not allowed to work. So I'm not sure what his plans are now. His big dream was to live there and open an MMA gym with his Finnish friends.

       Sorry, I misunderstood. They have been producing oil. Production dramatically increased in 2010. Commercial production started in 2013. They have yet to start exporting oil and natural gas, but that will happen soon.

       Ok, but Trump still wants to do it as well. He's argued over and over again that we don't take natural resources like oil from nations like Afghanistan or Iraq and that we should go back and take it. He has said that multiple times before.

       The war on drugs has been propping this country up for many years. Pretty much everyone agrees our monetary system/economy are unsustainable....Unless there was a way to remove a large amount of the money they continue to print from circulation....enter drugs.  They are very easy and cheap to produce.  They cost many, many times their production/transportation cost because of the criminal risk involved.

       Hold a monopoly on easy to produce, consumable, high demand products whose price is artificially inflated.  Give said product to the populace in exchange for paper money continuously printed.  Excessive paper money is removed from circulation(thus - for now-  preventing massive inflation) while the populace enjoys a distracting high...

       For sure. I didn't delve into it as much as could be done. Past the obvious economy angle - think jobs - police, lawyers, judges, court clerks, prisons and all that comes with it. Then think influence - do people doing illegal things tend to speak out?

       Well for one his statement that our monetary and economic system is unstable just isn't true. There can be bubbles (the 2008 housing crisis) but for the most part our economic system is becoming increasingly more stable, especially compared to the 1800's and early 1900's. Secondly, his statement that inflation is out of control is wrong for so many reasons. The Fed has actually been trying to increase inflation, for a few reasons that I won't get into, but has been having difficulty with it. Furthermore, paper currency is like 5% of the total money supply and the idea that the government needs to get it back to control inflation is absurd, because even if he was right about that point, the government could print less money.
      </p>
      <p>
       As far as the government having a monopoly on drug sales he's just talking out of his ass. Even for illegal drugs

       You should! Econ classes are super educational and useful. Alternatively, consider picking up a textbook on it, and educating yourself through that. My econ textbook was one of 2 textbooks I kept from University(the other being the big blue book of algorithms).

       There is nothing stable (or moral) about a debt based fiat money system.  It benefits those closest to the money hose and craps on those the furthest from it.  It is nothing short of the greatest theft of value in the history of humanity.  The Fed and IMF are responsible for so much misery and suffering in the world.  To hear how wonderful and stable the economy is from an obviously intelligent person while all real measures are total shit, and the ones that aren't barely break even from the 2008 crash is disheartening to day the least.

       You are also telling someone that they are talking out of their ass that there are government drug monopolies, when in the same paragraph you agree there are government drug monopolies?  But it's DIFFERENT because it is for a reason you think is OK, so that makes all the bad stuff go away?   I'll think of your dumb ass comment next time I have to buy an epi-pen for my kid.  Over $500 dollars I spent 2 months before they were "benevolent" enough to lower the cost (still multiples higher than years ago).

       What is your alternative? A metal based currency that forces deflation and leads to disastrous effects for the economy and exports deflation? And I'd ask you to elaborate on "the money hose". If you have a retirement fund or a bank account you benefit from the money hose, even if you don't realize it. And as far as medicine I'm not saying that our healthcare system is perfect, but would you believe if I said without the assurance of a patent, research and development would slow down, and the Epipen that your child needs would probably not exist without patents. Government allowing a temporary monopoly is not the same as the government having complete control of all the drugs.

       Money hose - those closest to the point of money creation (aka The Fed) get the most benefits, and have the greatest advantage to buy income generating assets.  Those at the end of the money hose see their dollars when their value has the inflation fully priced in.  This is the root cause of wealth disparity.

       The solution to the Fed is to have as many competing currencies as the market will support.  The Liberty Dollar got too close to market adoption, so it was killed - violating the UCC (among other things) in the process.  Crypto currencies are next.  They are decentralized so they will go after the exchanges by regulating the shit out of them as to make hit not worth the effort or legal risk.

       401Ks are called dumb money for a reason.  They were implemented to funnel all that juicy retirement money into the casino for it to be stripped by those that understand the game.  HFT love that captured money.  Saving for retirement sounds better though.  You can tell which reason they passed it simply from the early withdrawal penalty.

       You realize that the barrier to having epinephrine alternatives isn't in the actual drug, but the INJECTOR.  The FDA is an artificial barrier to entry for competition, and why $500 for less than $10 of product was being charged.  Monopolies are awesome if you are the monopoly.

       Drug development would no slow down, investment would not cease.  There is too much money to be made, especially on the cutting edge stuff.  However the handful of companies currently controlling the drug market today would have to share some of that enormous pie.  If you didn't know regulations equal control then I don't know what to say.  Our current system prevents more effective medicines than it allows, because nobody is going to spend billions jumping through regulatory hoops to certify cannabinoids and similar items if they can't patent them.  Don't even get me started on the prescription system shakedown.

       people conflate the poppies in afghanistan with prescription drugs. Hydro and oxycodone are made via thebaine, which is in low quantities in the poppies grown in Afghanistan. Afghan poppies have large amounts of morphine, which is then cooked into heroin.

       Ah I am stoned and alas did not make that connection, however with such a high number as 90% worldwide is it so outlandish to not out rule that some, might come from afghanistan, even if that amount could be negligable its not nothing right? But now I fear I've just detracted from putting forth anything truly meaningful. Sorry!

       the DEA has a "Heroin Domestic Monitor Program" report that they do every year.  in this report they go around and do heroin buys in a bunch of major cities, they then analyze the heroin content of each sample and they are also able to identify where the heroin originated.  either Mexican, South American, SW Asian (Golden Crescent: Afghanistan, Pakistan &amp; Iran) and SE Asian (Golden Triangle: Burma, Thailand, Laos &amp; Vietnam.
      </p>
      <p>
       the most recent report I can find is from 2014. they may have stopped releasing the reports to the public, I'm not sure.
      </p>
      <p>
       2013:

      </p>
      <p>
       2014:

      </p>
      <p>
       so to get back to your point, you're right in that there probably isn't ZERO afghan (SW Asian) heroin in the US.  just that it is a minuscule amount compared to Mexican and SA.
      </p>
      <p>
       In 2013 out of 765 samples tested, there were 28 of SW Asian origin and 0 of SE Asian origin. In 2014 out of 732 samples, 16 were SW Asian and 0 were SE Asian.
      </p>
      <p>
       back in the 80s (like 1979-1994) SW and SE asian heroin was imported to the US and made up like 50%+ of the market. check out appendix A Heroin Source Area Distribution -1977-2014 graph in the 2014 report

       lol what?  what is this even supposed to mean?  what raw material?  as I just showed.  opium poppies will grow pretty much anywhere.  and the heroin in the US comes from poppies being grown in mexico and south america.  NOT AFGHANISTAN.

       I think it's disheartening that we live in a country where you have to sell your soul to become president.  I know it's been that way for a long while, but it's getting worse.  I disagree with Trump on many many things, but the thought that he is just another corporate puppet doesn't bode well for the future of our "democracy"

       Pretty ambiguous. I was curious what rackets they control opposed to the Italians, Asians, Jews, Latinos, so on. Sounds like more russiaphobia.

         It's estimated that the group claims upwards of 9,000 members, and that it's bread and butter is the drug trade and human trafficking. Russian organized crime in general is heavily involved in the heroin trade that originates in Afghanistan: it's estimated that Russia consumes about 12% of the world's heroin, while it contains just 0.5% of the world's population.

       How are the Russians accessing those poppy fields?  What part, if any, are US troops playing in the dealing between the Afghan farmers and the Russian dealers?  Does Russia have covert ops on the ground?  Is one of the wealthier Russian mob bosses funding private militias on the ground there?

       The current fascination with Russia certainly predates 2014.  Figures with so many heroin addicts that they'd go to the source. My point is these rackets are intertwined. The Russians pushed diamonds in mafia territory of South Philly, I've been there. These organizations utilize each other.  It just seems funny to me that Forbes associated earnings with them, because it's in no way factual. Saying one is larger then the other is entirely dependent on made up information. So that's silly for me.

       More money behind them with Russia and the Oligarchs behind them, they are the strong arm in Russia as well which is what threatens the oligarchs. They are also much more aggressive and less cautious then the Mafia. The mafia do things in a much more subtle manner these days, they've had just about 100 years to learn and grow, the Russian mob is younger, all of the younger mobs and gangs are always out to show everyone something, like MS-13, they need that fear to keep the larger predators at bay.

       I've always seen Trump as a reaction of a group of
       <em>
        national
       </em>
       US Elites which make most of their money based on US assets vs. vassals-of/the international Elites whose capital floats to the best profitable areas.
      </p>
      <p>
       So from that perspective cooperating with the national mob is the only option left because everybody has at least the basic interest to protect their national assets.

       Pretty much every politician in this country and every other country is owned by the mobs.  The mob is literally running your governments - they
       <em>
        are
       </em>
       the political class.  And if anything Trump is probably owned by the Five Families, the Russian mob doesn't have shit on the Italians in terms of the global power structure.

       This. More people need to see this. What I'd like to add is that Cosa Nostra, Sinaloa, and others are working
       <strong>
        for
       </strong>
       the international financial elite class. They're the enforcers for the political class. This is why you rarely see candidates promoting real democratic policy such as ranked voting, term limits for national senators and representatives of the house, etc. (although I did see one state promote ranked voting, very exciting). I'd back that speculation up with the numerous times banks have been caught laundering money for organized crime. IMO it's pretty transparent at this point that the same people manipulating the market are controlling our politics and fighting both sides of a war on drugs via organized crime. That makes government the most organized crime of all.

       Yep.

       Keep preaching this way. There is nothing but Gangster economics and Gangster politics in the world. The will to power insures that "Pay For Protection" is the modus operandi for all-time. Heck, you can even add Gangster religion, which operates on the same level "Pay the church because it helps protect your soul."

       Trump was the most obvious corporate puppet of them all.  At least Clinton made an effort to try and hide it.  It's almost as if Trump's game was something like "Well that guy couldn't possibly be the murderer, he's twirling around a bloody knife in public, you'd have to be stupid to murder someone and then do that"

       I may be alone in this but I actually want American lives to get considerably worse. I want the rich to get richer and the middle class to deteriorate rapidly. We need another revolution. Most Americans agree on a lot of issues yet this isn't reflected anywhere in our media or policy (i.e. net neutrality). We outnumber the rich and we ABSOLUTELY have the power to force change but we sit back and continue to let these bullshit corporate whores to steal from us day in and day out, hoping that they will help us. Personally I'm just waiting for the people to say, "enough."

       I've seen studies say that populations revolt when they get hungry enough (or even when they have to spend x% of income just on food). Our corporate state has figured out that they can just give us Food Stamps (instead of bread lines), and it's all good.
      </p>
      <p>
       No surprise that we have record number of Americans on food stamps since the 2008 crisis. At least they won't revolt in the streets YET, but I fear we are headed that way after the next market crash.

       Fucking A you guys fall for this shit hook line and sinker. Xenophobes have been blaming immigrants for ages now, when it is the white executives in suits that are not giving YOU wage increases, yet they are cashing themselves out in the TRILLIONS. As an example, corporations have bought back over $4 TRILLION of their own stock in the last 5 years (aka cashing themselves out). Who is worse for workers? those greedy sociopaths, or Jose wanting to pick oranges in Florida?

       What America IS NOT, is a country by white people, for white people. It will be at least 40% Hispanic by 2030, just as it was x% German, x% Italian, x% African, x% Native American, x% British etc since it's very beginnings. NO ONE group is entitled to claim they represent America. We can all rally around the constitution, the bill of rights, and the enterprising spirit of America, but we have always been a blend of cultures and races. Get over it.

       The oligarchs have no control over this (declining population) or its devastating effects on an economy. I don't worship it, but I know the pains that come with a deflationary retracting economy. We don't have to make it worse by gutting population levels.

       Let's DO common sense immigration reform. Let's expedite the process for legal immigration so that people don't have to resort to crossing the border illegally. Let's provide a path to naturalization for those who have been participants of our nation for decades while obeying the rules. Let's view immigrants as human beings as a starting point. Let's not fearmonger others about people of color through sensationalizing and focusing solely on the few that commit violence. etc. etc. etc.

       Net gain is debatable. American citizens executed on orders of the president without due process for the crime of having differing views while in another country should be fucking terrifying. Not prosecuting perjury to congress should be more than troubling. Arming the enemy that is killing American soldiers with American weapons should be cause for riots. But the media served their masters well and effectively buried the significance of these events in ways that that should also be terrifying.

       What oversight and accountability are you supposing exists when the executive already did this with impunity? Obama set the precedent. If Trump executed an American citizen abroad for ideological differences without trial, what do you suppose would happen? Do you think the public would take it? I very much doubt it. But Obama was able to convince people that the Constitution doesn't matter.

       I did a google search for "U.S economy before and after obama" and i came across
       <a href="http://www.factcheck.org/2016/01/obamas-numbers-january-2016-update/">
        this article
       </a>
       .  If you're the kind of person who doesn't believe anything obama does is good then this probably won't mean much to you, but I think it's a pretty good look at simply how the numbers changed from the time he was in office.  Personally, I see a lot of good there and the fact that he turned an economy that was getting worse every year into one that is stabilized and actually growing is absolutely an impressive feat.  I just don't understand how people can maintain that obama was a shitty president especially when you can look up the good things he's done online and he's sandwiched between George W. Bush who put us into a depression and a war and Trump who is proving to be the most retarded president we've ever had in this country.

       Your comment says "All three promised big things, all three changed nothing." How does that not ignore the events that happened during their terms, their personal opinions, the policies they tried to enact, their public optics, the people in their staff and Congress, and the myriad of other factors that went into each of them?

       He's got no one in his corner now that Bannon is gone, his proverbial nuts are cut off, powerless and Isolated by his Russophobes War Hawks/Oligarchy. He'll be gone by the fall. He did however Advocate for peace against other Nuclear powers. The hateful and dangerous progressive liberal left are attempting to steer the programmed Americans in the wrong direction.

       Let us not re-write history here folks. Just because Putin knows how to man-handle Trump doesn't mean Trump is a pacifist who bwants to hold hands and sing kumbaya. His erratic macho inept bullshit almost wrought chaos and destruction over the Korean peninsula, until big boy China had to step in and cool some heads.

       Billionaires don't all have the same exact goals or ideologies.  Trump, Mercer and others like them are nationalists and constitutionalists that correctly point out that globalism has destroyed US sovereignty and the national sovereignty of nations all around the world.  Being a person of his stature in the business world, it's only natural that Trump has rubbed elbows with just about every person on the planet that has power in some way, it's part of the business.  This gives him a lot more leverage than the average politician because he's not motivated by ideological pursuits, he'll make a deal with anybody so long as it's in general good faith and not blatantly fucking his or the country's bottom line.

       Well, you've got a bunch of different reasons:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         The Organic Act of 1871, which changed our country from a Constitutional republic to a "democracy" under maritime law, fundamentally changed the relationship between the government and the governed through legal trickery in the edited Preamble of the Constitution and the Fourteenth Amendment, and created the vassal city-state of Washington DC, which is owned by the Crown Corporation (the City-State of London, which is in turn owned by the Vatican) as the capital of a corporate Federal government with its own laws and regulations, which is how it circumvents the Constitution as it's technically not a part of our country;
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The dollar has dropped about 98% in value since the 1900s thanks to our Congress illegally passing the Federal Reserve Act into law and selling us down the river into usury-based fractional banking slavery to foreign banking cartels;
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         FDR confiscated people's gold in 1933, with Nixon performing the coup de gras on the gold standard itself to create the petrodollar;
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         NAFTA, the World Trade Organization, the Free Trade Agreement and globalism itself completely gutted our manufacturing and industrial base and sold it to the third world which destroyed our middle class and has resulted in half the country being below the poverty line;
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Our government is basically owned by multiple other foreign entities, corporations and banks to the point where Princeton University has agreed that we are technically an oligarchy
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Just a few reasons, there's plenty more.

       Its the idea of promoting corporate interests over the interests of working class Americans and it's been happening for decades.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        international trade agreements, including the Uruguay Round, the WTO Agreement, NAFTA, the current Atlantic and Pacific agreements, which are all specifically designed as investor rights agreements, not even trade agreements. Very high protection for major corporations, for big pharmaceuticals, media conglomerates, and so on, and very high barriers through intellectual property rights. Devices that allow corporations, but of course not people, to sue governments action that might potentially harm their profits. That is a particular form of globalisation designed in the interest of the designers. The designers are concentrations of private power, linked closely to state power, so in that system they are consequences of globalisation.

       you're not entirely wrong.  However, the fact that he didn't at least offer up a plan of his own as a blueprint
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       his fault.  You can make all the grandiose promises in the world, but if you have no roadmap of how to get from point A to point B, you're just blowing smoke.  That's what the republicans have been doing for the last 7 years and it's exactly what Trump had been doing until the legislation was defeated

       Voting against a bill that hurts your constituents means you're suddenly against your party? Here's a thought: what if repealing Obamacare is still a priority for them, they just recognized that the bill they were voting on was trizznash?

       Trump fucked that up for you guys by saying he was going to repeal
       <em>
        and replace
       </em>
       . The GOP only said they wanted to repeal it until Trump came along and said he was going to make sure there is "insurance for everybody".

       Trump should have had a universal health care bill ready to be signed on day 1, if his campaign promises were anything to go by.

       He was just showboating, it's in his nature, he needs attention like the needy lil bitch he is. The real fucked up thing is the amount if idiot yanks who fell for it.

       Sure, maybe he really intended to do those things. And maybe he couldn't have really predicted the severity and extremity of the deep state and the power they had. Maybe he can't do the things that he wants to do.

       Thing is he isn't trying at all.

      <p>
       His cabinet appointments and advisors did nothing to "drain the swamp". Former Goldman Sachs advisors and employees. Hiring from within his family despite lack of proof they were best qualifies for the job.
      </p>
      <p>
       He isn't trying to take down the "deep state", if anything his appointments have shown a closeness with the most corrupted and corruptable influences, on a level that is nearly unprecedented from prior presidents.

       I've been lurking in t_d since the beginning, back when it was mostly satire. Ive listened to rush Limbaugh, Sean hannity, and all the other right wing radio my whole life. I live in the south, all my neighbors are conservative and my coworkers are mostly right wing. I lean left but I have some conservative views, I hate the Clintons, Bernie was too liberal for me, I understand why Trump won.
      </p>
      <p>
       However now that we've seen him in action for more that 6 months I can honestly say the Donald Trump is an existential threat to America, and therefore the rest of the world. The sooner he is removed from office, and the more damning the evidence used to justify his ouster the better.
      </p>
      <p>
       For those of you that want examples of what make him so dangerous, I'd say just look around, read a newspaper, look objectively at what he's done and how the people around him say he acts. If you aren't at least concerned, then you're eithet too brainwashed or too stupid to convince of his obvious flaws.

       As a third party voter, I gave him a chance and he has blown it spectacularly. He lined his cabinet with Wall Street insiders, just like Obama did and Hillary would have. He's made justifications for mucking around in Syria, just like Obama did and Hillary would have. And now he's parking us in Afghanistan for eternity...just like Obama did, Bush did, and Hillary would have.
      </p>
      <p>
       I admire his intent to upset things in Washington, but the military-industrialists have shown him what side his bread is buttered on and he's playing good little bitch to them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hell, on day one he went straight to the CIA and gave them his infamous "please don't JFK me" speech by bribing them. Not long after that, he basically told the Pentagon it could run itself.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump is no great leader and he is no evil tyrant. He is a little bitch-boy who got in over his head with the deep state and now has to just settle for playing at his job and appointing who he is told to appoint...just like Obama did and Hillary would have.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump was our best hope for real systematic change and he didn't have the balls to follow through.

       I was similarly disappointed in Bernie's cowering after the DNC threatened his wif...I mean after he changed.

       I mean really I didn't vote for trump and I despise all of those things, but I'm hoping this disaster kicks the collective asses of the american people and the country is revolutionized for the better. It may be just a dream but a man can dream.

       Johnson is every bit the bumbling moron Trump is and his policies would be horrible for the poor and middle class. Whatever you have against Clinton, she would've been forced to implement Bernie's policies, is a steady hand on the world stage, and wouldn't embarrass us every time she visits a foreign power like trump does and Johnson would.

       While Obama did intervene in Syria to a minor extent (supplies etc.) he easily could have made engaged us in a ground war in Syria or Iraq, neither of which he did. Overall, his foreign policy in Syria was too restrained if anything.

       Not a Bannon sympathiser but I fear he was the reason Trump never escalated for more occupation in Afghanistan. I knew in the back of my mind that the instant Bannon was gone, Trump would make an announcement for more boots on the ground. Lo and behold, the announcement came. Just like clockwork.

       The take? Bannon was way more influential than anyone has ever thought.

       No, your initial intuition was correct. Trump is still polling in the upper 70s among republicans. At this point I don't think any amount of facts or logic are going to sway that group, they are running on pure faith in their own version reality.

       There's a whole other argument to be had here regarding whether or not his policies have been positive. But anyway, I do think his rhetoric matters. The President is one of the most influential people in the country. People on both sides pay attention to what he says.
      </p>
      <p>
       I guarantee you that what white supremacists across the country heard when Trump said "there was violence on both sides" is "I am in support of your actions". They believe they have a friend in the White House, and it is emboldening them. By refusing to condemn them, Trump contributes to their behavior

       It was factually correct, but it's a statement this ignores the overall context of the situation. Racists showed up to a town with weapons and chanted Nazi slogans, and one of their members drove a vehicle into a crowd. They share the lion's share of the blame for what happened, not the counter protestors

       Maybe it wasn't the right situation to speak out about it but who else is going to condemn the lefts violent protests? Every time they hurt someone or multiple someones no one in the media says a damn thing. Yes they didn't run over and kill someone with a car. Trump condemned that. If you want to argue he didn't do it hard enough or fast enough whatever I don't care about that.

       There's discussion to be had about the methods some members of antifa use. But it should have been an afterthought compared to racists organizations spreading hate and committing violence. They are the most divisive and harmful force in America right now, and the continual efforts by Trump supporters to distract from and defend them is embarrassing

       Man you really have swallowed the rhetoric. Counter protesting does not limit free speech, and isn't covered by the first amendment. Free speech only guarantees you protection from the government censoring you, not your fellow citizens telling you you're an asshole

       First of all I said free speech not the first amendment so don't put arguments in my mouth. Second, they don't 'counter protest' they are always looking for a fight, blocking roads, and without permits most of the time. Why do you think the supremacists were carrying shields and weapons? Because they expected people would violently attack them. And they were right.

       They had a permit in Charlottesville. And you're focusing on a select set of incidents as opposed to the larger picture. Look at Boston, there were a huge number of counter protestors there, and little to no violence

       The bigger picture is there is a growing violent faction in the United States and it isn't white supremacists. Their numbers have always been small in the modern age and everyone fucking knows what true racism is and we as a society don't want that shit. It has already been decided. The fight is over.
      </p>
      <p>
       Antifa is the bigger problem. The media, shills, and normal idiots are legitimizing their actions good and bad (mostly bad). They think its okay to physically assault people they think are """"nazis"""" and destroy property. But whatever dudes lets virtue signal about racism and muh grandpas fought nazis on twitter some more. Good work.

       It's because we don't fight wars the way they should be anymore. Read any history book that deals with war. We will be going back every 10 years unless we kill almost all the men and boys. The boys grow up to be men and want revenge on the US for killing their fathers. They get together, form a group, and start doing attacks. It's been going on for 4 decades now.

       So, let me get this straight.  The problem is that we're just not killing enough children?

       And it's real easy to talk so callously about slaughtering kids when you're safe and sound behind your computer screen on the opposite side of the planet.  You're a fucking pussy.

       I'm not. I've deployed, done my dues. Seen plenty of people die. I'm just speaking the truth and people don't like it cause it's a fucked up truth. We saw kids become soldiers, throw explosives at US soldiers. The average age of a Taliban soldier is 16. We are already killing kids, you just don't know it.

       I'm not from there, and I'm not a supporter, but I think there's a little bit more to the story. As others in this thread are saying, the Deep State is very powerful, and it's not easy to get stuff done. Despite that, there is evidence to suggest that Trump is working with the Alliance and doing what he can to take the Deep State down. So regardless of my thoughts on his policy (it doesn't really matter since the Deep State largely influences that for any president), I at least respect him for attempting to take them down.

       The Alliance is basically the resistance against TPTB. They've been working behind the scenes to take down the Deep State for years. There's a whole war going on that we don't even really know about. Many of them are ex-black hats, and are working to right the wrongs that they've done and protect humanity. If you're interested in learning more, PM me. This thread clearly isn't the place to discuss this kind of thing. Too many people are buying into the medias bullshit and not willing to look at the bigger picture.

       my friend. It's unlikely for you to be subscribed to this subreddit and not know what the Deep State is, so I'll just assume you came from

       .
      </p>
      <p>
       From Google Dictionary: a body of people, typically influential members of government agencies or the military, believed to be involved in the secret manipulation or control of government policy.
      </p>
      <p>
       It can be used fairly interchangeably with TPTB, the Cabal, the black hats, etc. You get the picture. Let me know if you have any other questions.

       Their existence? I would say it's pretty undeniable when you start noticing. Have you ever seen Prison Break? Shows like that are an example of how feasible and likely it really is. I would say that with a system like ours, it's almost inevitable.

       There is no Trump agenda.  That's why he can say all Americans should have healthcare, and then demand to sign a bill that guts it.

       Look, just because you don't like his policies doesn't mean he has none.  Obama's ACA needs to be gutted because it's an unaffordable mess.

       I used to buy Trump's bullshit, but I realized in time that he's deliberately vague so that people read whatever they want into it.  I thought he was a secret democrat, for instance.
      </p>
      <p>
       What made me see it's all snake oil was when he said "women who get abortions should be punished as criminals".  It takes two seconds to see how stupid that is, most obvious being the statistical certainty of a miscarriage being prosecuted as a crime -- punishing an innocent woman for a tragedy cannot be good policy.

       This was an argument that was addressed literally 200 years ago.  You could only arrive to DJT's conclusion if you were talking out of your ass.

       Regarding Article 5, his aim is the same as expressed in his speech this week.  He wants allied nations to pull help in the effort, so the US doesn't have to do everything.  He's been successful in this, and NATO allies have upped their military spending in accordance with the budgetary expectations of their membership.  And Trump has now committed to Article 5.  He did the same regarding China and North Korea.  And now the same with India, Pakistan and Afghanistan.

       Now you're asking the right kind of questions!
      </p>
      <p>
       I obviously can't say for sure, seeing as I don't know him in person. But there are actually a lot of reasons someone in his position might.
      </p>
      <p>
       For starters, a lot of people go a long time down one path before their conscience or guilt catches up to them. Maybe he learned about all of the human trafficking and fucked up shit that was going on and wanted to do something about it. Maybe he was sick of the way he was seeing this country run. It's possible he even gives a shit about other people more than himself and his money (I'm not saying this is the case.) Maybe he's been working for the Resistance for a long time. Or maybe he has his own ulterior motives.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whether or not we know why he's doing it yet, what there is a lot of evidence for is that he's trying. So we should at least acknowledge that.

       Like what!? I don't see any evidence that he's doing anything other than whatever the fuck he wants cause he's a old, rich, narcissistic shit bag (plenty of evidence of that from literally is his entire life before politics) who is slowly losing his wits before our eyes.

       The most powerful person in the world is going to war against dnc/globalist/deep state MSM. That's one very telling proof that he is up against something. And MSM is literally trying to start a civil war by supporting antifa, creating false narratives that Trump is supporting nazis/kkk. And the sheeps who believe every narrative that msm spits out will fight on one side, and the ones who sees through the lies will stand on the other.

       You don't need the media to see what a baffoon and an asshole he is, you just have to pay attention to him. The 'other' side of this imaginary war may well be true, I don't have an opinion on that (globalist/deep state shit). But Trump isn't fighting anything, he's a fucking moron.

       Any sane person. The climate accord was a joke, a literal money making scheme. It was costly, ineffective, and a huge waste of taxpayer money. The payoff is not even close to the cost. Especially when the cost includes hundreds of thousands of jobs.

       There's a lot of information on the internet, I would recommend maybe researching things for yourself sometimes, rather than following the circlejerk. Good luck!

       Which is what I expected. Trump isn't running a internship, if you can't get results get the fuck out. He'll do this until he gets the right mix. He doesn't care if it looks bad politically, he doesn't care if John Oliver will make fun of him for it, he will do it until the right people show up for work.

       He won the presidency because we have millions or people in this country who are fucking retarded and bought in to this conman's simple bullshit answers to complicated questions and empty promises or grandeur. I'll give him credit for being able to take advantage of that opportunity within American voters. But he has no idea how to run this country and if you think he does, you're a fucking idiot.

       Obviously not all those who voted for him did so because they hate mexicans or muslims or whatever, that's an unfair characterization. I can absolutely understand why people are frustrated with the status quo, why they feel establishment politicians don't represent them, etc. That doesn't give them a free pass for allowing themselves to be fooled by such a transparent con-man. And I really don't see any excuse for not realizing what a piece of shit he is by now.

       What other choice did they have, exactly? Clinton was probably the most status-quo establishment candidate of all time, and everyone knows 3rd parties don't have any chance. They weren't fooled - at worst, they chose the lesser of two evils. At best they chose someone who they believed would shake things up for the establishment. I think you'd be hard-pressed to argue that Trump hasn't delivered on his promise to shake up the establishment/status-quo. I feel like I'm getting exactly what I voted for, and I could give a fuck how polite Trump is to the shithead elite that have fucked us with a polite smile for decades at least.

       Seems to me like he's largely followed republican party lines on most issues and been a friend to the business elite while not really doing shit for average people whatsoever. All while continuing his extremely divisive, hyperbolic, and lie-fueled rhetoric. He's lowered the bar for politics more than ever, done a shit job of diplomacy turning us into a laughing stock around the world, emboldened the worst parts of the "alt-right", lowered the bar for critical thinking and just in general has been exactly the Demagogue he was from the beginning. We're more divided than ever, meanwhile the people he appointed to power continue to chip away at protections for average citizens for the benefit of the rich. He IS the elite and he's continuing to enable them to fuck us and people think he's different because he talks out his ass about "bringing jobs back" and openly scapegoats minorities.

       Lots of people felt betrayed by Obama. The establishment's obvious hatred for Trump is all the evidence I need that he's not one of them. The focus on the "alt-right" is just the media having hissy-fits; these people were the same before Trump became elected and they are not numerous or powerful at all. If anything, it was the democrats' identity politics that "emboldened" this small swathe; identity politics that became their clearest when nobody could criticize Obama for anything without being called a "racist bigot."

       People on the left go too far with identity politics sometimes, and people on the right focus too hard on the extreme ends of that. People also had good reason to bring up racism with Obama.. with all the insisting he was born in Kenya and comparing Michelle to a gorilla and bullshit like that.

       The media over-represents them, because they (the media) are establishment trying to win back their power by pushing a false narrative. They've been caught doing this many times. Left and Right common people hate each other, but left and right elites are buddy-buddy. Not so with trump - the elite from both sides began attacking him the second they thought he had a chance.

       Sure many of the elite publicly don't support him because they want to distance themselves from the man, but most are probably giddy at the prospects of having a cabinet full of bankers and industry elites, able to form self-serving policy easier than ever at the expense of common people. More tax breaks for the rich, fewer consumer protections, same old shit as every establishment Republican. He's no champion of the common man.

       If what you're saying comes to pass, then it wouldn't have mattered one way or the other who they voted for - unless you are claiming that the democrats don't do the exact same thing. They had nothing to lose. I don't think you can fault them for taking the chance. I also think it's too early to tell, but I like what I've seen so far.

       I have a pretty good standard for competency: if you have towers with your name on them and you have won the presidency of the United States, you are allowed to criticize the competency of other people with self-named towers and who have won the presidency of the United States.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you have towers with your name on it and have you won the presidency of the United States? No?
       <strong>
        Then your brain is lying to you
       </strong>
       when it says it can accurately gauge the competency of someone who has done those things. But the hallucinations make you feel good, why question them?

       That's one of the dumbest arguments I've ever heard. Truly fucking stupid, congratulations. As if having towers with your name on it makes you fit to be president. Literally listen to the man talk, read his conversations with other world leaders.

       If "trying people out" is his strategy, as if this was some sort of Little League team, then that further supports the notion that we are dealing with a total amateur. Real leaders are better judges of moral and ethical character, or at least don't have a literal revolving door of cabinet members in the first 6 months. That's called throwing shit at the wall to see what sticks.

       Bar none the weirdest behavior out of this election is seeing so, so many people who don't matter, who have never mattered, and who have never had even the tiniest shred of authority brazenly commenting on competency and leadership when they so clearly know nothing of either.

       It's disappointing, as are many of the things he's done and said since he took office. I won't pretend to be an expert in middle eastern politics and know the best course of action, but his comments about military action being on the table for Venezuela is what bothers me even more. Leave these fucking places alone, man. Campaigned on focusing on domestic problems and not doing shit like that. Frustrating.

       I wouldn't say I "support" him. I said I don't regret my vote. I think in 15 years, looking back, the country will look more like I want it to than if I had voted Clinton or 3rd party.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is he a piece of shit? Yes. More of a piece of shit than Hillary? I would say yes.
      </p>
      <p>
       So much if it comes down to the Supreme Court though. Getting Gorsuch in there (though in reality Obama should have been able to appoint, but that's another argument) is huge. Maybe we will get another conservative justice, not sure. But Clinton being able to appoint 3 liberal justices I think would have been far too much.
      </p>
      <p>
       I actually don't like any party having huge majorities. If I had my way we'd have a conservative Supreme Court, non-super majority in one house and maybe the presidency, maybe not.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lot of random thoughts in there, and not written very well. Pretty tired right now, so forgive it.

       Abandoning Iraqi too early, forsaking the blood-sacrifice of our children waging war, and enabling ISIS to grow in strength in the greatest military blunder in American history.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only reason Al-Qaeda had any power at all is because we abandoned Afghanistan in the 70's.

       A President that listens to his military leaders?

       Well fuck, too bad Obama didn't
       <strong>
        <em>
         listen
        </em>
       </strong>
       to General Mattis when the told him exactly what would happen in Iraq if they withdrew and instead Obama fired him for "speaking truth to power".
      </p>
      <p>
       I am not thrilled with the cost and prospects of nation-building because morons like Hillary or W. or Obama go at haphazardly and with no competency in execution nor any commitment to success.
      </p>
      <p>
       So while I fear Trump will fail as all other before him, let us hope he finds some success for the sake the future world.

       Sorry dude. The reason alqaeda has power is because the cia trained and armed them in the 1980s. I agree, we shouldnt have pulled out of afganistan prematurely.  We also shouldnt still be there since 2002 protecting poppy fields. Get in, get out, let it be their problem

       The biggest talking point that's coming out of TD lately is A) "everybody talk about ANTIFA" and B) "The media is trying to divide and conquer us, can't we all just get along?"
      </p>
      <p>
       It's B) especially that should be a huge sign the Trump administration is failing.  People don't start saying "Can't we all just get along?" when they've spent their entire political lives fighting the identity politics fight, unless their particular side just started losing big time.
      </p>
      <p>
       What's happening, is that the Trump administration, and their supporters, are being divided and conquered.  People who are okay with his comments about the Virginia riots, and people who aren't.  People who are okay with his plans to send more troops to Afghanistan, and people who aren't.  People who believe it's not his fault that Obamacare is still here and the Wall isn't, and people who don't.  There's only so much you can do to keep all his supporters united under His name.
      </p>
      <p>
       Meanwhile, the rest of us, both left and right, both DNC and GOP politicians, both CNN and Fox News, everyone is out there condemning him, uniting in their distrust of the Trump administration.  I haven't seen America this united since before the election.

       As somebody who was on the streets resisting neo-Nazis in Europe in the 90's, it both amuses and terrifies me to see people in Europe get their idea of what "Antifa" is from the American alt-right dominated internet bubble. It's like hearing little walking Stormfront agitators. It affects everyone, from every ideological stripe. I would say another American round of leftist activist demonization was a resounding success, after PETA and BLM. I'm sure that last sentence alone will trigger another round, but it's a definite pattern: framing the discussion and image perception of activist groups by either outright demonization (PETA is literally Hitler) or equating (Both sides are equally bad) is something straight out of the American propaganda kitchen and the internet's wide, international reach through social media, blogs, "alternative news" and so on can only be described as
       <em>
        wildly successful
       </em>
       . Americans now control public sentiment about activist groups in Europe. Rather than knocking on their neighbor's door and asking about it, I see people's opinions being formed and shaped by the internet, then spread around over beers in the bar. It has little relation to reality, downto completely erroneous pronunciation of acronyms betraying baseline ignorance.

       I strongly disagree!
As a cousin to one of the former top people in ANTIFA i know they did as much if not more violent crimes, hit jobs, shake ups and in general violent behaveour as white pride in our country.
      </p>

       I agree that the perseption of these groups may be missunderstood and that the have good intentions. But its completely wrong to day that they do not have violet part or have made calls for violet actions. These establisments are fundamentally un-democratic. They like the other extreme group on the far rightdo not want democracy, they want their ideas to rule in what average people would consider a turanical way.
      </p>
      <p>
       That being said i truely do believe that they mean well and want to correct problems in our society through their tyranicle rules.
      </p>
      <p>
       My cousin and a couple of antifa friends were some of the most violet people i have met. So i think the correct messagde is to say fuck both sides of the extremes.

       Left right paradigm? You cant categorize trump under a black or white blanket. Everybody has pros and cons. 
The real fight here is adhering to the constitution, and making sure everybody is given equal protection under the law as an american, whether they are antifa or nazis. As long as people dont infringe on each others rights, they are free to say whatever the hell they want.

       Dude who subs to r/The_donald here. I think it doesn't matter who's President. It's still the powers that be who run things. He's just the salesman. I also believe that in a more conservative society because liberals like positive change (So does everyone one in their right mind) but I don't want a fast liked lighting radical change. Just like like most businesses, growing to big and fast can make your business implode. And that's what it looks like what's happening now. IMHO
      </p>
      <p>
       As a life long New Yorker, that has seen Donald coming up in the world in the news for building parts of NY, in films and hearing folks using the phrase "Who do you think you are, Donald Trump?!", whenever you spend money frivolously. I think it sets a true example that anyone can become president. It doesn't matter who you are. As long as you know how to play the game of life and win. Skies the limit and you can truly change the world. One way or another. We can use our free will all we want, but what's meant to be, will be. In my eyes.

       Situation is very complicated much more than we would know. He is not Ron Paul alot of people want Trump to be Paul, it isn't happening. He ran on bringing jobs back to USA and reducing illegal immigration, stepping away from globalist plans. There was some promise of locking her up but I didn't expect that anytime soon.  Everyone wanted a purge of all the wikileaks exposing criminals but if that was public as soon as he took office the left would have a real motivation to escalate the impeach / remove. In terms of Afghanistan I say he should have a shot at ending cant complain that we don't at least try it a different way. He did say no rebuilding just exterminating.

       Truthfully I think he got in way over his head and didn't realize the president cannot snap his fingers and people agree with him like in the business world. In my opinion he found out that insider Republicans and dems are actually playing on the same team artificially campaigning bullshit year after year only for the status quo to move in again. He's the biggest threat that either party can imagine and he can only do so much when both sides want to stifle him. I will give him his 4 years or 8 years of support then I'm leaving the Republican party to be an independent. I hate Republican party as much as Democrat party now and I only support trump as far as politicians go.

       That was with different articles, hit pieces, opinionated garbage. Right after Trump's inauguration the stock market shot up compared to a barely rising closes. Obama was on a good track with our finances, Trump is a business man and knows who to get to make it work better for us.

       The presidency has absolutely nothing to do with his alleged business skills, I think you'll agree with that. Not that he doesn't make money off it but that's beside the point.

      <p>
       I didn't go bankrupt four or five times, so no, my employer is pretty happy with me. I also don't go out telling people I'm the greatest business man ever while I went bankrupt four or five times. This is about Trump, so my business skills are also completely irrelevant to the discussion.

       The market shot up because the republicans got all three branches and they thought they would get a ton of tax breaks. Now that they realize the Republicans can't get anything passed, they've gone back to the steady climb they already had under Obama.
      </p>

       It had nothing to do with trump. Neither he nor the republican congress have made any noteworthy changes that would have affected the markets as a whole. Disbanding a regulation here or there won't do shit to the overall market. Oh now water bottle manufacturers can sell water bottles at national parks?! BUY BUY BUY

       Hmm, I thought I was agreeing with you but your confrontational nature won't allow it so here we go...Sure, trump hasn't started a war in his first few months...good for him. He has managed to antagonize the majority of our allies and enemies. Not to mention his rhetoric is pretty much the most bigoted since the pre Civil Rights era. Plus LOL on him not pushing agendas... he is serving the conservative power bloc as much as anyone before him. Just look at the Skinny Bill... a terribly written plan put forward because of exclusively conservative interests. The man couldn't even get it passed with the senate majority... already worse than Obama in regards to implementing change. I won't expect you to change your mind tho. You can't reason someone out of a position they didn't reason themselves into

       Trump has gone out of his way to avoid war since he's been President.  The same cannot be said for virtually all the rest of them.  Yeah his rhetoric is childish and churlish towards some of them, but his plainspoken take-no-shit demeanor is exactly why a lot of people voted for him, especially after having Obama who was perceived as a very weak, ineffectual President that just tried to placate everybody.
      </p>
      <p>
       Provide evidence that Trump is a bigot or racist.  The majority of the country agrees with his stances on illegal immigration, and he's not reinstituting slavery or Jim Crow laws for fuck sake.  Looks more to me like he's just unencumbered by political correctness, and that's a good thing in my opinion.
      </p>
      <p>
       How is he pushing the conservative agenda?  They've done almost NOTHING since they took power, and a large majority of them oppose Trump and his policies and work hand-in-hand with the Democrats to obstruct his agenda.  What exactly is he supposed to do when his own appointments can't get confirmed due to blatant manipulation of the rules and obstructionists being in charge of the vetting process?  This is further proof to support the notion that the vast majority of the mainstream Republican Party hates Donald Trump with a bloody passion.  Just because there's an R next to his name doesn't mean they're on board with anything he's doing, they rode him into the election because he literally embarrassed and chumped out all of their frontrunners, and they had no choice but to support him because their constituents would have thrown them out of office if they didn't at least pretend to.  Hence why you're seeing the Republican Party getting sued by their own constituents because they're not getting on board with the voters' intent to support Trump and his agenda.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump is pretty much doing the best he can with the tools he's got, and in that regard he's hardly been the worst President ever and has in fact affected some positive change here in there.  I can be objective and call him out when he actually fucks up and support him when he does something right.

       what ideas about white supremacy and nazis do you like? no, seriously. you wear this holier-than-thou both-sides-are-the-same naive nihilism on your sleeve don't you? i called you a cultist because from your responses, i could genuinely not see objectivity with regards to trump criticism. nowhere did i lump you into any crowd, trump supporters or otherwise. frankly, that's irrelevant here. what is relevant is serious logical thoughtful discourse, which i found thoroughly lacking when i come across comments such as this. i gave you a quick rebuttal: trump's major failure and you can see obama as easy contrast, is his thorough incompetence in dealing with healthcare.

       No, there's no holier-than-thou anything.  I'm a centrist and I see both sides as equally as possible and make my own determinations.  You don't know anything about me.  I can tell you how Trump is a Zionist and kisses Israel's ass too much, I can talk about how Trump's basically lining his cabinet and the government full of rich fucks that don't give a fuck about his agenda or the American people, I can talk about how Trump should shut his mouth more often and not post on Twitter as much because it looks bad and makes us look bad, but there's already three thousand other fucking accounts right on this sub that do the very same thing in every single thread (even in those that have nothing to do with him), and I like him more than I dislike him.  That's not being naive, that's me having a fucking opinion based on my own evidence and experiences, and you can kiss my ass.

       Yes and no.

       Trump is fantastic at playing the masses. He is extremely good at getting people to follow him and was able to use social media almost to perfection. There is no doubt that people will study how a complete buffoon was able to become president.
      </p>
      <p>
       Having said that, if you were to actually study his words and actions you'd immediately realize how much he lies and deflects. The guy will never take responsibility for his own actions and constantly blames everyone. He has created a huge rift between the right and left to the point that many of his supporters would be willing to take up arms if they felt slighted. You say this makes him smart, to me it looks like an incompetent idiot who doesn't understand the ramifications of his actions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump got to be president because he lied and said everything that his supporters wanted to hear. No one cared if anything he said was true or not, but people were happy to hear someone say America first or that he would bring jobs. None of this has happened and his first month's have been a disaster but people are still happy that they were able to get their "own" president who they think actually cared about them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump isn't that smart, but he has one great quality and that is no shame. He doesn't give a fuck if you hate him as last as he has power. And due to it he has constantly lied and projected, and his base ate it up.

       I think it's the people that see and take everything at face value and think there's nothing else behind what they're doing are the ones who are really fooling themselves, but good on you.  You can point to a ton of different instances where Trump will act like an asshole or say something that seems outlandish and then a couple days later he's proven correct.  The point is you can also make obvious inferences at his success in life and figure out quickly that he's really not an idiot or he wouldn't be where he is.

       Hillary's not in jail, there's no funding for a wall, he did not declare China to be a currency manipulator, he's increasing our Middle East intervention, he had a total failure of leadership on Trumpcare - and he can't even find enough people to work for him these days.

        Middle East
This is flat-out untrue.  We have almost no presence in Syria right now, Iraq is getting better, ISIS has been virtually destroyed thanks to joint cooperation between us, Russia, Syria and Iran, and we are attempting to broker a deal to reduce tensions in Libya.  Last I checked we don't have any more wars coming up, so what are you even talking about?
Healthcare
His own party screwed him on this and nobody wanted any of the bills to pass in the first place because they're awful.  It was the Republicans that refused to work with the Democrats for a bipartisan bill, that has nothing to do with Trump.  And on the positive side of things, the failure of those bills buried Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell.
Appointments
Being blocked all the time by opposition Democrats and Republicans by abusing the rules so he can't get his appointments in.

       I wouldn't say he's an idiot either, I think it's a bit more accurate to say that the entire establishment will do anything they can to destroy him, refuses to work with him, and is not giving him an inch to enact any of his agenda.  He may be the President, but they don't really have all that much power in the first place, and when you have almost the entirety of every branch of government literally sworn to destroy him, how exactly is he supposed to do his job?

       Is it really that surprising to understand that Congress does not want investigate Hillary because she will basically bring them all down if she goes down?  She's not "too big for jail" in the sense that she certainly deserves to go no matter how rich or powerful she is, but in the sense that the establishment does not want somebody of her stature going down because of what they are going to reveal to get out of it, you can bet your ass the last thing they want to do is pursue this.  The fact that she's going after a plea deal may not be satisfactory to some, but it means things are happening even if we're not privy to the dealings.

       I think up until this point we assumed a base level of competency.
      </p>
      <p>
       The President has a very large amount of power. He can unilaterally in many instances set our foreign policy. Yet here he is, rolling back on his promises.
      </p>
      <p>
       On the rest, the President tends to use his bully pulpit of rally his party, and his sill sin negotiation to get a few votes from the other side. He was simply unable to do so, and instead of addressing his leadership deficiencies, he blames the minority party.

       Your comment is essentially spam. The vote manipulation on this thread is very impressive. Yeah, yeah, spare me, you think people just agree with you and the voting honestly reflects the opinions of real people in this community. You think I'm annoying for bringing up vote manipulation.

       Then he's still a failure then, right? His whole pitch was that these are deep systems and he's the only guy tough enough to break 'em up, and he can't. I personally think he's been basically a phony from the jump (if not an intentional attempt to discredit anti-establishment politics), but even giving him the benefit of the doubt as to his intentions you can only come to the conclusion that he's weak and failed.

       Why is it so hard for people to understand this. You can't just do whatever you want when you become president. The deep state is very involved and influential. It's difficult to know who to trust, and how to get away with getting shit done.
      </p>
      <p>
       I didn't vote for him, and I don't necessarily even support his policies, but I do believe he's working with the Alliance to take down the Deep State. And he's making more progress than the MSM (owned by said Deep State) would have you believe.

       I think the real conspiracy that the far left and the far right folks are missing is that deepening divisions weaken the United States as a whole. Society will suffer as the rich get richer and the media carves deeper lacerations in America to get more clicks and views. Whether you think it's a foreign power or the wealthy elite (like Trump or Soros) or just fanatics with a grudge doesn't matter. This country is worse for these divisions and we should blame all those who profit from it, not just the ones with whom we agree.

       I own two small businesses, and I feel just as ripped off by rich people as anyone else. By rich I'm talking about the 1%ers, not the upper middle class.

       And fighting poverty is laudable, but fighting economic inequality is much more important. Inequality sucks the life out of economies and makes almost everyone poorer.

       I know this will sound really douchy, but... Being just 1% is not exactly what you think it is.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most 1% people live near big cities. Most big cities have a very high cost of living. A 1% household income will buy you the life of a much lower taxes bracket just 100 miles away.
      </p>
      <p>
       Case in point: My family was just over the threshold of 1% from around 2008-2013 (the company my immigrant dad built primarily worked with Eastern European clients who not affected much by the '08 crisis. We lived in a somewhat nice but small house on Long Island, on about 1/8 of an acre. We drove three modest Japanese cars (Honda, Toyota, and Subaru). The only thing that was really different was that I was able to go to college without taking on loans. However, I was really lucky to receive extremely generous academic scholarships. Otherwise, I probably would have had to take some loans.
      </p>
      <p>
       My girlfriend's family lives in a house that's roughly twice the size on a property that's roughly eight times larger in Connecticut. Her parents' joint income was maybe a quarter of what my family's was.
      </p>
      <p>
       The 1% isn't as rich as most people think, when you take living expenses into account. The really rich people are those who are consistently clearing a million in annual cash income, or higher. This is much, much smaller than just 1%.

       Oh, believe me, I don't. I grew up dirt poor and my parents ended up filing for bankruptcy a few years back - my dad's business went under in a pretty dramatic way, when the Ukraine crisis heated up.

       I've just always been annoyed that the 1% has been called the source of all evil, ever since occupy wall street. In the same way that the majority of major cities are quite poor, the majority of the 1% lives the life style of the 25% in the rest of the country. Not to say it's a brutally hard life, but it's not a life of extraordinary luxury; it's just very comfortable, and not much more.

       Can't speak about other communities, but the top 1% has been an enemy of minorities and impoverished since way before occupy wall street. I mean like hundreds of years. The disparity has just increased since. Nothing personal against you or your family, but there's just typically a disconnect in lifestyles and experiences.

       Your parents certainly have an easier time than most Americans (as do mine) but they worked for it, and used the money to get you an education (as did mine) instead of using money to buy lawmakers and control industries and hurt other people to profit while talking about how much better they are than everyone else (not that every super rich person does this of course) but that is what the inequality has lead to for the worst people in society who lack empathy

       No one said they were new. And yes, three Japanese cars, with fabric seats, no extras, and each costing ~$18-24 grand is comparatively modest. Claiming otherwise supports my point; I don't know if you realize just how rich people get. A girlfriend I had I high school bitched me out for driving a "shitty Honda" instead of "at least an Audi".

       It was a 1,400 sq ft ranch with four people living in it. When we first moved in, my two grandmothers lived there too. That house cost an arm and a leg. Part of my point was that making comparatively high income would have been much harder if we weren't living on Long Island. But living on Long Island meant our money didn't go as far it would in other places.

       I don't really appreciate you jumping to these conclusions. My family immigrated from Russia in the 90's. My dad moved here with $300 cash. He worked as a bus driver by day and a taxi driver by night, living with four roommates in an attic apartment in Brooklyn, back when it wasn't advisable for white people to walk around outside after sunset. After a year he saved enough money to bring the rest of my family over. We lived in a barrio on Long Island, in a three family home. My upstairs neighbors were junkies and waking up to gunshots wasn't exactly a rarity. At the time, my dad started his business and we were splitting $30 grand between six people. Eventually, my dad made enough money to move into a the aforementioned ranch. My parents have no money that they didn't earn themselves by staying up until two in the morning, night after night for two decades. All the connections they might have had live across an ocean, in a country where my dad had a price on his head, thanks to altercations with the local mob.

       Notice how I said '08-'13. In 2013, the political situation in Ukraine went to shit. My dad's business, which relied on a 60-40 split of Russian and Ukrainian clients went under in just a year. My family went from being in the 1% to having a negative net worth. My parents now live in a $40ish grand home in upstate NY and are below the poverty line. At this point in my life, the only money I have access to comes from my paycheck. I'm not starving, but you'd have to be a moron to call me rich. I drive the sake Honda I drove ten years ago. I've had several moments where I've had to choose between paying for gas  and food. Believe me, I'm not as clueless as you're trying to make me out to be.

       no, an 18-24 grand fucking car - and three of them at that - is not fucking modest.  Do you know what real people spend on cars?  They don't.  They have to take the bus because they can't afford a piece of shit 3k used car from 15 years ago.

       Boo hoo your parents had to work to get it - generations work themselves to death here and never get to even own a house or a car or ever get any kind of freedom.  we're born, we work, we die sick.  that's that the life of the average american is.  I'm sick of rich people fucking whining about inconsequential bullshit.  If you think money's so bad sell one of your 3 fucking cars.  hell, sell 2 or all of them.  sell your house and fucking rent.

       Having your tuition paid off and buying a ranch on Long Island isn't really common. Part of your lifestyle is where you live, you think its the same everywhere in the country? Quality of life is a thing. The cheaper it is, the lower that gets generally speaking.

       Generally speaking yes. But there are plenty of exceptions. Like I said, there are plenty of areas, within just a 60 or so mile radius of where I grew up, where the location isn't any worse but your money goes way further.

       Compare living in San Fran on a 100k salary to living in Boston on the same salary. Neither city is better or worse than the other. But 100k will take you way further in Boston than in San Francisco.

       If you dont like the look of the average 1 percenter, the lower bound a few years ago was 465k individual AGI. (Of course AGI is usually much lower than your actual income at that level). Still far out of all but a tiny percentage of small business owners.

       Seven figures is rich by anyone's definition, and they should IMO face higher marginal tax rates to incentivise either charitable donations or reinvestment into their company in the form of better equipment, or higher employee compensation.

       Yet historically that hasn't been the case.  People don't just stop increasing their wealth because they are angry at the prospect of paying more taxes.  The way marginal tax rates are structured, there's always incentive to make more money as the higher tax rates are only applied to amounts made over a certain tax bracket.

       Small business owners aren't rich, they're upper middle class, maybe even true middle class by historic standards. I think he's referring to big bank execs, board members of defense contractors, people named Rothschild. There's a difference between successful small business owners and moneyed power.

       In CA alone there are thousands of "million dollar a year" restaurants. Meaning they bring in over a million dollars in sales. After a few years those owners can easily save near a million. Same goes for professors in prestigious schools, after writing multiple textbooks the royalties become very high. Same goes for real estate agents, car salesmen, and the local plumping company. Saving seven figures is very practical over two decades in some professions, and they do not associate​ themselves with the upper class. That is my point.

       I'm not one of the ones downvoting all your shit, but consider this:
      </p>
      <p>
       1 million dollars would allow me to pay off my mortgage, student loans, both cars, and have more than half left over.  No debt and living expenses covered for years.
      </p>
      <p>
       To me it sounds like anyone who has/makes that kind of money but lives somewhere so expensive that they have to live modestly has fallen for some sort of scam.  Just move, lol.

       By definition, having one million dollars (in assets, let alone cash) puts you in the top 5%. Almost all classifications consider this to be upper class. If you make a seven figures income, that puts you in the top 1%. Undeniably upper class.

       yeah they made the bracket just for him since he controlled so much i believe
      </p>
      <p>
       Seems it was later that there was a 94% bracket after WW2
      </p>
      <p>
       top rates coming out of World War II, which the Eisenhower Administration left in place into the 1960s. During the war, the top “marginal rate” was 94%, but 94% of what? Then as now, income tax rates moved up at distinct break points. In this made-up example, consider a 15% rate up to $25,000, 21% from $25,000 to $50,000, and 25% over $50,000. Those making $50,001 or more won’t pay a quarter of their total income, but rather 15% of the first $25,000, 21% of the next $25,000, and 25% of everything above $50K. That’s why the system is called progressive - the percentage rate progresses upward with income, but the higher percentage applies only to new (marginal) income above each break point. In 1944-45, “the most progressive tax years in U.S. history,” the 94% rate applied to any income above $200,000 ($2.4 million in 2009 dollars, given inflation).

       That would be better I would think, but that is never going to happen without getting campaign contributions banned that's my biggest issue and would think things would start falling into place for everyone after that. No more big bribes for politics to rig the game for the mega rich=louder voice for the smaller guys. I hope I live to see the day a progressive tax plan is at least attempted.

       We are all poor compared to the 0.10% who own 90% of the worlds assets. We should hall the elite rich into the streets and behead them and their families and see how quickly their Swiss/Offshore bank accounts are opened up. If this started happening 1/10th as frequently as car bombs happen, we would start seeing things change.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course the flipside view is that you could divide up all wealth perfectly, mathematically equal among everyone, and within 5 years you'd have poor people and rich people.

       Pretend? I'm explaining how being rich isn't some automatic club which everyone thinks and behaves the same. But continue hatting on successful people who make a lot of money. They are not the "rich" to hate on.

       Almost like there can be differing variation of wealth and living conditions. But continue placing millions of people into an arbitrary category you cannot define.

       That's exactly what you're doing, you know fully well we mean the ultra-rich elite, the bourgeoisie. It's nothing but deliberate obtuseness.
      </p>
      <p>
       Leftists actually use different terms to refer to labourers and capitalists, they don't see a well off plumber or doctor as a problem. Of course, you'd know that if you actually knew anything about leftists and weren't just regurgitating right wing narratives about the left.

       The middle class owns tons of stock.  Their 401ks are very important.  Especially the boomers retiring right now, it makes sense financially to only pull money out of your 401k in good years than bad years.

       That's true. It also doesn't mean people have jack shit in their 401ks. If you make $35,000.00, you aren't getting much at all out of your 401k.

       Most people who wouldn't even know that their 401k is actual stock market investments are probably too stupid to contribute to one. But again, most people aren't contributing to 401k's because prices of everything have inflated beyond sustainability while wages have not risen/shared the same inflation. Someone making $50k/year in the 90's was WAY better off than someone making $50k in 2017.

       I mean thats basic inflation... but it sounds worse when you put it to a real world situation. I'm 28 and make as much as my dad did when I was a kid in the early 90's.
      </p>
      <p>
       I live by myself and was lucky enough to afford a small house a few years ago, I barely scrape by and drive a 10 year old car (putting 4% in my 401k). I don't drink and I can't remember the last time I "went out" with my friends.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the 90's on roughly the same salary my dad supported 2 kids and my mom and still had enough left over for a 3000+ sq ft house with a ski boat, new truck and a minivan.

       This pretty much nails what I was trying to get across. My parents bought the home we lived in for 20+ years in the early nineties for ~140k, they sold it last year for over $350k. I'm pretty sure it was under 3,000 sq. ft too. A 1995 chevy tahoe was $29k MSRP for 4 door and 4 wheel drive, a 2018 base model tahoe with 4wd starts at $51k MSRP, granted there are electronics and far better safety features, a car almost doubling in price while incomes have remained stagnant is just one of the many reasons people are saying 'millenials are ruining X and Y, millenials aren't saving, millenials aren't spending enough, etc.'

       Yeah, but I also want to point towards personal responsibility here. I personally just started investing in stock in the past 2 years. I had thought about doing it years ago and didn't wanna use my spending money on it. If I had it is likely that I would be fairly upper class. Most of us don't manage money well and then want to blame it on people that do. Don't get me wrong by the way I know that some of these conspiracies are right but a lot of the "1%" haven't been there long and wont be there long. Hating people just because they are better with their money isn't much better than hating someone because of their skin color. I do think that a lot of politicians are abusing their positions to stay in the 1% and really think we should ban together to remove those that we think are doing this. I also think that elected officials should have to post all revenue from the moment  they get into office until they die in public forum so that it can be monitored by citizens for wrongful payment.

       Maybe..  maybe not.  I think the honest calculation is to determine how much money you could've put into a few indexed funds and see how it would've done.  While you're compounding interest,  don't forget to compound inflation.

       That seems a little off to me..
       <em>

       people tend to blame the wealthy,  but the "wealthy" are not a homogeneous group either.  Plus,  there's more to ending up successful than how much money your parents had,  they connections they can use to influence your life can be absolutely tremendous as well.  People see unfairness in this system,  and wrongly attribute it to the whole,  but it's not as if it's not a completely invalid observation.

       Historically social action vs. money plays out in a very common pattern,  and it's not usually to the social activists benefit.  Wars do the best at inverting wealth,  but no one is eager for that.

       It's

       than that.  Say your a Senator,  and you're on a committee that works with the Food and Drug Administration,  so you're in a position to see new and important drugs just before they enter the consumer pipeline.  So..  you tell your money manager to buy a bunch of stock in that particular company before it hits the market.  Instant windfall.

      <p>
       To assume that most politicians are wealthy because they take bribes is insane.  The FBI would be eating them for lunch,  no -- these people are much more intelligent and insidious than that.  The campaign donations are just icing on the cake,  preventing them from having to spend any of their "own" money on their own re-election;  why would they misappropriate

        that

       I honestly think the only change you can make is to introduce a real substantive third-party into the current federal system.  It will be ugly,  and it will slow the government down even more..  but it will frustrate the efforts of those who so easily manipulate the machine currently.

       Well the "bribes" usually take place as cushy jobs after they get out or jobs for relatives or speaking fees. There are tons of ways to skirt this without actually breaking the laws as they are currently set up. As for another party into the federal system? I assume you mean another branch or are you talking about another party like republican/democrat. If it is another party I doubt that would make much difference. If it is a watchdog branch so to speak that sounds nice but it all comes back to who watches the watchers and more levels doesn't necessarily make it less faulty. I think more concrete laws on lobbying, donations, and clarity of financials from elected government officials would be the fastest and best way to approach the situation although even that would take an act of congress so to speak :D

       Disclaimer that I don't post here often. I'm a millenial software engineer who just started work at 100k gross annual salary. My student debt obligation is around the same. It's somewhat frightening because I'm drowning in debt and yet I'm within the top 10% of earners in the US.
      </p>
      <p>
       The scariest part is that there are a lot of people who aren't landing jobs like this and also have serious debt obligations. Probably not as bad as mine, but that's going to really fuck people trying to enter the middle class who are trying to marry and buy a home. There's a reason why millenials are getting married later, buying homes later, and "killing" a lot of past times the previous generations had more time to enjoy.

       As a fellow 100k team member, pay down the debt ASAP.  I was laid off in '08, and luckily I had very little CC debt, a low rate on my mortgage and two paid for cars.
      </p>
      <p>
       But damn, I would have been screwed if I had your level of debt.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, the best way not to get laid off and something not everyone learns, but...   Just because you are out of school doesn't mean you can stop learning.  Stay on top of all the new languages, there are going to be a ton of your peers that will never learn the new stuff and it will give you a huge competitive advantage for you.

       Seriously. The tunnel boring machines of today are more than capable. There are massive tunnel networks across the country, mostly between the Appalachians and the Rockies, that are known as Deep Underground Military Bases and were built by tunnel boring machines that literally melt the excavated rock and reform it as the walls of the tunnel.

       Or, they had a medical condition, needed surgery with some recovery time, had to 'borrow' from the 401k, take a huge tax hit on that, stop contributing to stay above water because disability during recovery is only 50-60% of pay, etc.  The costs associated with any medical hit are way beyond just copays and what they consider tax deductible- which is also a joke.

       Oh fuck off with that bullshit. Democrats are sell outs for their corporate interests, and the insurance lobbyists made damn well sure any policy going into effect wouldn't actually solve anything and lose them money. Obama never intended to actually fix healthcare just like the Republicans in power now. Quit pretending other people ruined a great idea; it was shit to start with. Single payer is the only way to reduce healthcare spending in this country, and everything else is to get the people to shut up about it.

       No. When that 38% goes up there will be another crash because the rich need to sell to someone. Right now it's staying even because there are too many rich people who have too much to lose. They need "retail" investors who don't know any better. And there are a lot less of them right now.
      </p>
      <p>
       The 2008 crisis was the rich getting out (of everything as time went on) and they could do that through a variety of means that 401k holders typically don't know about or understand. These days they have to be a lot more careful because stinging their fellow rich men invites retaliation.
      </p>
      <p>
       So they are waiting and hoping that this great stock market will eventually win back the gullible, someone they can finally sell to enmasse. Meanwhile they're lobbying for lower taxes on this eventual profit.

       What, you mean you don't buy into the notion that it's okay for your young years to be miserable slavery to the grind so that you can finally have some money to live off when you're too old and frail to properly enjoy the freedom you "earned"? Assuming you even live that long?
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean, I don't think saving for retirement is a bad idea, but I've always been confused by the notion of enduring financial woe and pinching pennies during the years you're young and healthy enough to fully appreciate things like traveling and adventuring, for the sake of having the freedom to do those things later when you're too old to enjoy those things anymore. It just doesn't quite make sense to me.

       i just mean that 401ks are just tax free bonus lanes for executives and high level employees. 4% matching is nice if you make &gt;=$250k, but matching at $12/hr will never allow low level employees to retire. or pay for medical bills, much less travel anywhere. Maybe travel somewhere you can live off $1/day lol

       Sme jobs I guess. Personally my insurance plus HSA covers all medical bills I have. I don't see my 401k as a retirement fund tbh. I've managed to accrue about a year's worth of pay in it and it's nice to have there making money off itself at 10% interest compounding.

       You are saving 'rainy day' money in  a tax-deffered account with literally all the down sides; if you wanted money 'making compound interest' you should be using a brokerage account and a mutual fund, not a damn 401k.
      </p>
      <p>
       You do know the day you need any of that money, your paying taxes + 20% fees on top of that, so you're literally losing 60% of your 'just in case money' by using it? Saying you use your 401k as a glorified savings account is extremely ignorant and dangerous to other people who may listen to you (no offense), as its the completely wrong approach to a 401k.

       He said he'd have 10k in cash (aka emergency savings) if it wasn't for those specific emergencies. Sounds like he's a pretty decent saver but yes he should be putting money aside in tax free accounts (Roth or portfolio based life insurance with an established mutual company)

       I don't think you're really earning 10% compound interest on a money market fund in a 401(k) plan. There might be some kind of misunderstanding. Maybe you think the default investment fund is a money market fund?

       Your comment doesn't mention that with very few exceptions, the maximum annual contribution to a 401k by an employee is $18k. It's not an insignificant amount of money but it's not like CEO's are putting half their salary into it.

       I don't disagree - if you're making $12/hr you're fucked. However, there is a large percentage of the population (estimates from US Census bureau say around 13.5%) not making much more than $12/hr.

       Please. Im a financial advisor/planner. I work with people in their late 20s making 70k a year with over 700k saved in their 401ks because they've been with a company for 10 years and took advantage of the 4-6% match from the beginning. They're living just like all the other late 20s people I meet with making the same amount they just know how to budget their money and will be retiring at 50 of 75. You're trying to tell me that saving 5%-20% of your income anywhere less than 250k is going to make or break you? Get real

       Similarly, I don't understand why wealthy parents wait until they die to hand over inheritances to their children, rather than helping their children with said money when they need help buying houses, laying off student loan debt, etc.

       My Trump supporting sister in law goes on about how great Trump is because the stock market is doing well. Then I ask her how much stock she owns. None. Also, the stock market has hit an all time high the last 30 of 54 months. These are market forces at work. Yeah there was a surge when Trump landed in office, but that surge has stalled. Anyways, it's a good point that the middle class is not reaping the benefits of these gainz.

       When my dad invested my college fund, he used CDs that he purchased at a bank. They were based on US treasury bonds with a 5% interest rate, give or take. Today that option is not available. There are no banking instruments that will outpace inflation. It's essentially graft for stock brokers.

       Or people are more interested in clicking on an article about someone on the "other side" that they hate. Whether or not the media is willingly dividing the country, there's obviously an aspect to it where people want to read/watch what they're putting out.

       The media has access to stats like clicks views retweets trends etc.  just like advertisers has access.    The media can instantly see what people read/watch.   It's like breadcrumb trails to get people to fall right into the trap.  Emotion is the easiest thing to bring them in, especially with race, gender, identity or trump.    The media will spin any story they can into one of those topics, even when it's not relevant.     Then they keep pushing it and pushing it.   Until one day it's chaos and the consequences of outraging people for money ends up exploding.

       I guess, but ultimately it comes down to "stop paying attention to clickbait". All I'm pointing out is that, to an extent, it goes both ways. People want to hear what they're being told, whether or not it's abusive/wrong of the media to exploit those desires.

       It's that I want to turn on ESPN and watch sports highlights and analysis but instead they show all the players that kneeled down.  And then they bring someone on to share their opinion on it. Next thing I know they spent 7 minutes of a 22 minute NFL show on the kneeling.

       It's shoving this kind of shit in everyone's faces to get a reaction

       It's not being able to do anything without some sort of political message or divide being brought into it.   At times when it's completely irrelevant and I want to just relax and enjoy something.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's constant manipulation for reactions because reactions equal #'s and $.

       The media most certainly deserves blame. The 4th estate is supposed to speak
       <em>
        truth

       I'm sorry, but when it comes out that the 17 agencies is a lie from a campaign then the fact checkers double down on the lie and say it never mattered anyway - you get a fair picture of what they see as "truth". Then you get well respected publications' editorial staff publicly advocating the dissemination of propaganda it only gets clearer still.

       If at this point you still believe the media has any commitment to the truth you should be criticizing yourself instead of blaming the entire populace. Most of them know better than you what is going on.

       They were opponents during the primary; after Bernie lost they were no longer opponents. Bernie gave much worse condemnations of Trump than Hillary.

       Although newspapers take sides, they are as much part of the establishment as anyone else. They are there to make money. Ignoring Trump or any news that is just theory as non-news, means no sales. No sales means New York Times falls into a small town paper, or in terms of online status, less advertising, and less traffic. Its a double edged sword for knowing what to do to make the change, versus blaming the other side to keep sales going and people arguing.

       We can talk about it all we want as long as it's framed as the dirty ungrateful lazy fuckin poors unfairly demanding handouts from our benevolent job creators who deserve exponentially greater compensation  becausee their labor somehow inexplicably provides that much more value

       fake edit: also with the unspoken understanding that no, you may not question how that added value is provided because you wouldn't understand the answer anyway so just shut the fuck up and be thankful you even have a job at all you stupid poor

       mostly agree. some people are deserving of it though. saying you shouldn't hate

       is a bit to Judeo-Christian for me. hate is totally rational under certain circumstances.

       Iv met a few 1%s and all of them have been amazeing people, they have donated more money in a year then ill probably make in a decade. 'The Rich' is a horrible term to use when applying hate. Your calling for hard working people who have made their mony over many years. 1% is still way to large of a percentage maybe .1% the billionaires. Yes you earn a lot to be in the 1% some cities $650k annually up to $1.5m to make the minimum amount for 1% status. These are hard working Americans that deserve the wealth earned. $1.5m annually is pocket change compared to the billionaires. I am not a rich man, I dont own a home. I have no problems with 'the rich' I have a problem with billionaires controleing our country holding its people as slaves. Don't blindly hate people, look at there actions in life and not just what others say.

       Careful there... There's nothing wrong with being rich. Its getting rich via profiting off of others loss that's the distasteful bit. There are plenty of "rich" people out there who give tons back to their employees and/or communities. Class warfare is the last thing we need right now. I mean true class warfare. That's how you end up like Venezuela.

       Eh. The comment was poorly worded, and at the time in a piffling thread in a nondescript post.  Had I known  it would have ended being one of my all time highest upvoted comment I might have expanded a bit further. Then again, if I had, it probably wouldn't have been so upvoted. But that's Reddit.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I meant to say was that the richest of the rich are running roughshod over the economy, so if people are pissed off that their lives are shit, then they should stop looking to the MSM to find out who to blame. The MSM is controlled by rich people, so you will never learn from them how much they've stolen from the middling classes via lobbying and the unlimited "free speech" they can exercise through their corporations thanks to Citizens United.
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically, the lives of everyday Americans have gotten harder and harder for decades, not because of gays, or immigrants, or neo-nazis, or muslims, or Vladimir Putin, but because the richest Americans have scrupulously, bit by bit, over a period of decades, bent the system in their favour.

       We need to focus on straight fact based reporting news outlets, though I don't know what you guys suggest.  AP, Reuters?  Take the talking heads and biased analysis out of the news and just focus purely on what is actually happening.  The confusion and conflict come from the "entertainment" aspect of media analysis.

       The real problem IMO is two fold:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        no one wants to pay for news anymore
       </li>
       <li>
        there are too few news organization competing
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       If people still thought paying for news was reasonable, then they would be paying for real news instead of that which is filtered through both the passive editorial power of advertisers, and the active editorial power of the the corporate conglomerate owners.
      </p>
      <p>
       Between the multifaceted interests of paying advertisers and conglomerate owners, what ends up on the website is so thoroughly filtered, biased, and spun that is no longer resembles news in the traditional sense.

       The ruling class isn't necessarily "the rich"; however they are "old money" they've had wealth for generations, like the Vanderbilt family. Most of you retards will never be smart enough to be rich so you can't tell the difference between old money and new money. There are families that are still spending great-great-great-great grandpa who came over on the Mayflower's money. They run shit. Politics are dictated by business not what will benefit society as a whole. Politicians serve bankers and investors. We are just the cogs in the Machine, if we break down, they replace us with a cog hats made in China

       It's new money too but naturally old money is a lot wealthier and more discreet, it's not like it's some sort of nasty conspiracy where becoming ultra wealthy lets you into some secret club, it's the simple fact that in the system we live under money = power and people will use their power to benefit themselves and the things that benefit the mega rich and big business almost always hurt the working class.

       I think we are all to blame for trends in media coverage, because we are the ones reading, clicking, and watching the divisive stories. A solution to this dilemma begins with each of us looking inward and detaching from our own biases and tribal instincts.

       This is due to how much tracking and stats the media has access to.  Just like google can guess who you are an Amazon can guess what you buy before you buy it...the media has near instant results to find out what stories are generating clicks and views.  What stories get reactions.   They spin stories into being a Trump issue or race issue at times just because they want to bring up those emotions and get those views.      It's a sick social experiment that is gonna have terrible consequences in the end.

        "The Midas Plague" (originally published in Galaxy in
        <strong>
         1954
        </strong>
        ). In a world of cheap energy, robots are overproducing the commodities enjoyed by mankind. The lower-class "poor" must spend their lives in frantic consumption, trying to keep up with the robots' extravagant production, while the upper-class "rich" can live lives of simplicity. Property crime is nonexistent, and the government Ration Board enforces the use of ration stamps to ensure that everyone consumes their quotas. The story deals with Morey Fry, who marries a woman from a higher-class family. Raised in a home with only five rooms she is unused to a life of forced consumption in their mansion of 26 rooms, nine automobiles, and five robots, causing arguments. Trained as an engineer, Morey modifies his robots to enjoy helping to consume his family's quota. He fears punishment when his idea is discovered, but the Ration Board—which has been looking for a way to abolish itself—quickly implements Morey's idea across the world.

       Knowing the sub I'm in, I have to preface my comment with this. Just because I'm not addressing Obama, or specific things from the left doesn't mean they don't exist and that I, or others, don't recognize them. It's just not the topic of this comment, so leave the strawman wastes of comments please.
      </p>
      <p>
       That being said, this reminds me of the noam Chomsky quote about how there's really just 1 party, the business party. And that party has two offshoots, Republican and Democrat. The rich will always have self interest, that is truly not a partisan issue. I think the real difference comes from how they go about it. TO ME, it really feels like the Republican side of the business party does this through some really vile abuses and more in your face while being completely remorseless about said tactics and outright lies. AGAIN, I'm not saying the left doesn't do fucked up shit, lie and work in self interest. Up until the last year or so (and including the obstruction and questionable criticisms from the R house/Congress during Obama's terms) I'd have said both sides are equally shitty. But now, especially with Trump at the head who is either too stupid or too incompetent to monitor what he says and how he says it, and with the lack of backlash from the GOP, it seems very obvious that one side is more beholding to the business and political elite. Perhaps this seems this way because our government is mostly Republican right now so we just see it more than dems, but nonetheless it seems to be the reality of the situation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regardless of what side you're on, personally, idc about labeled sides, politically I think we should all be trying to get to the best outcome for every citizen, not to punish those you disagree with or to self enrich, but regardless of side, I think everyone can agree we need to get money the fuck out of politics. This shits been going on for as long as government has existed, but fucking citizens United gave it an unlimited gateway without the need for discrepancy. This was probably a ramble, hopefully it made sense.

       Yup! The Chomsky quote goes further to discuss how both sides, with the help of the media, pay so much attention, airtime and tribute to surface issues so that they can paint differences between the parties when in reality there are very few (until Trump, I honestly feel like he's a new factor, and not in a good way. I feel like he brings out the worst in both sides as he's extremely divisive with actual divisive beliefs (racism, calling for violence, refusing to compromise, etc. Etc.). Up until now, and even now, it just gets shadowed by whatever tweet Trump sends out, but both parties 'hot topic issues' aren't really meaningful (in terms of nation strength compared to other countries). Like we constantly get the debate on abortion, gay rights, personal lives and shit like that. Now obviously those affect hundreds of thousands, maybe even millions of people in the US, and they are certainly issues to be addressed. But c'mon, those have very little impact on a huge majority of Americans, in other words those aren't country-health defining policies. Abortion/gay rights won't budge the GDP or increase employment. They're just used to divide the parties because they're some of the only real 'yes or no' (right or left) policy questions. All a facade to divide and rally. Focus on the non issues so you don't see how handle the real issues. (Again, not saying gay rights and abortion or whatever aren't issues, they are.. they just won't get us out of a recession or help strengthen our country comparatively to other first world countries)

       I completely feel that. It took me like 2 years to get all the way through Manufacturing Consent because, like everything Chomsky says, or writes, is just so godamn dense. I mean what he has to say is borderline genius and pretty damned ironclad to dispute, but it's both of those things BECAUSE of how dense and info heavy they are. I feel like if he had the charisma/ability to make the information accessible to the public (as in, like you said, people who aren't masochistic could actually read or listen to him) like say Bill Nye was with science for kids, or Dawkins for undergrads, he could really enact some change in this country. Unfortunately we're in the depths of a severe anti-intellectual paradigm shift, and he's just not charismatic so his ideas stay limited to those willing to suffer through his lectures/thesis' and those who aren't willing, reject or ignore or don't even know of his existence.

       Jesus Christ. Did you not even read what I said? Did you just get to the word Republican and lose your shit? First fucking paragraph. THE FIRST. obviously I didn't fucking mention those things about Obama and alternate views on the same opinion, because like I said... it's not the topic of my post. I could sit here, literally, for the rest of my life typing out every single thing I disagree, don't like, see as a problem, about one side while equally addressing the equivalent issues on the other side and I wouldn't even cover half of them. This whole cyclical bullshit you're spinning is so pointless. I was commenting on the climate of the government today. Right now. Not 5 years ago. Not 2 years ago. Not 50 years ago. Right now. But good point, something I wasn't remotely talking about, even addressing or acknowledging because it wasn't directly related to the topic, does exist. Well done!
      </p>
      <p>
       And to your second "point". That I'm just parroting what the tv says. Please. PLEASE, send me one link to a major media news network citing Chomsky and making the argument that both sides are dirty, corrupt, and beholding to political and financial elites and that citizens United was part of That. Also, I haven't had cable in 12 years so I'd be pretty fucking amazed to find out I'm parroting tv talking points, if I am, shit maybe I should be a news host. Is it really so mind blowing to you that someone who has different opinions than you, might just not be some imbecile who just takes what he hears and regurgitates it without thinking and without forming his own opinions on their own? Do you have that low of an opinion of yourself? Do you think that you just parrot what you hear? Because if not, then do you think just maybe, you're not the only person on this planet that can think for themselves and base opinions off of facts, statistics, expert opinions, or whatever you use to form opinions? And that maybe, just maybe, that that someone else, who is fortunate enough to be as wise, intelligent, learned, and informed as almighty you, might simply just have a different life experience than you and subsequently have a different opinion than you?
      </p>
      <p>
       I ask these questions because I'm genuinely interested in people like you who see their opposite political party as enemies. Or maybe just as idiots who can't think for themselves. Considering the climate politically right now, especially with the general left skewe on Reddit, my post was pretty damn neutral. I mean, shit, I even addressed that I might be viewing things with a bias since right now the majority of government is Republican. Because seemingly (idk you, so I could be wrong. Maybe just caught you in a bad time or something. Idk) you can't seem to fathom the possibility you might be wrong (again... since apparently I have to spoon feed this to you, I'm not saying you ARE wrong. Just that as humans, you are human right? As humans we possess the chance of being wrong about anything. It's just a fact that exists and extends to everyone) or even might just not be 100% correct, but at least I gave the possibility credence. All I ask is this; what do you want to be the outcome of Trump, or even just government in general, or actually, just in complete general terms, for the future of OUR country, what would you like to see? (Generally) do you want to see it improve or get worse? If your ideal future for America is for it to improve, which I expect it is, do you think the best result/chance for that to happen is to villainize, oppose, attack, and write off anyone who has different opinions than you? Or would it probably be beneficial to the chances of improvement to instead work with them, since you, we, us, want the same thing. We all want America to be great, continue being great, and be greater, so why fight each other, hear and see where I'm coming from and work with it. If you actually look at what we both said, they're not dissimilar, just literally different topics. I agree with most of what you said, as you did mine seeing as how the parts you tried to attack were legit generalizations and oversimplifications for the sake of brevity.
      </p>
      <p>
       So please, just answer that; if every true American wants what's best for this country, you and I included, why resent and fight each other? This is all I ask In this fucking rambling novel I just wrote

       Eh.  Who do you think owns Silicon Valley and the media?  Left-leaners.  What do you think establishment right-leaners own?  Guns and oil.  The left wants to completely undermine the right's economics (e.g. less war, more gun control, renewables are good and climate change is real).  The right wants to undermine the left's economics (e.g. climate change is a hoax, trans culture in media is poisoning our children, free liberal arts college degrees will never work, we need to bring industry back).

       When the "republicans" are out of power, do you really think the "Democrats" will improve things?  Your personal information will be owned by every company and used against you, your primetime TV shows will continue pushing the idea that feelings are more important than freedoms, and climate-change-based regulations will make it nearly impossible for anyone other than the rich to start a business or own a home.

       Dude. Holy shit. I just got like 4 comments saying the same unrelated bullshit. My whole point was that both sides are fucking garbage and corrupt. I even said in the end of my op that I'm probably seeing with a bias right now because there's just simply more republicans in office. I.e, more chance of them doing or saying something controversial. Just like how it would be with democrats. My whole fucking post was about how both sides are garbage but you still try to spin it like I'm some liberal parrot pushing some agenda. None of what you just said had anything to do with my op. My first paragraph I literally say that just because I don't mention something, doesn't mean I dont know it exists, or don't think it's a problem, I just simply didnt mention it because it wasn't directly related to the topic I was responding to. And what's the response? To do exactly that. How in the fuck is anyone supposed to discuss politics, the future of OUR country or shit, discuss, anything, if you use lack of evidence as evidence. I mean what the hell am I supposed to say to get any form of constructive dialogue going here if me addressing the fact that I'm talking about one specific facet related to the mentioned quote in relation to the political climate right now, doesn't mean that there aren't other problems, issues, disagreements or concerns out there on the opposite side, and I even give credence to the possibility of bias due to the governmental demographic right now?
      </p>
      <p>
       I said it in my last response and I'll say it again here. Do you think that you're wrong? No? Good, you shouldn't. Me neither. Now, what do you want to see for the future of America? Do you want to see it crumble In ashes of another civil war or whatever, or do you want to see it be great, continue to be great and continually increase in prosperity? Yeah, 2nd choice, me too. We want the same thing. Every true American, wants the same thing; to better America. So stop trying to attack and tear down every opposing opinion you see, especially in the manner you did of just bringing up completely unrelated topics as if my lack of addressing their existence is proof of incompetence, and converse with your fellow Americans. Work with them. It's literally the only way this corrupt system of government has any chance of changing for the better. I'm not right about a lot of things I'm sure, and neither are you, because we're both humans. So let's not act like we're infallible and use what each other knows to work to our shared goal.

       That was my point. The part specific to republicans was followed up by an addendum that I may be seeing them as worse because of a majority bias. I'm not sure what other way I can express my belief while still giving benefit of the doubt to the opposing view and the possibility, and even plausibility that I could be wrong or not fully objective.

       <p>
        Up until the last year or so (and including the obstruction and questionable criticisms from the R house/Congress during Obama's terms) I'd have said both sides are equally shitty. But now, especially with Trump at the head who is either too stupid or too incompetent to monitor what he says and how he says it, and with the lack of backlash from the GOP, it seems very obvious that one side is more beholding to the business and political elite. Perhaps this seems this way because our government is mostly Republican right now so we just see it more than dems, but nonetheless it seems to be the reality of the situation.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       This is what "bothered" me for lack of a better word.  I just don't see how anything changed in this last year.  Both sides have proven they are scumbags who refuse to listen to each other.  You thought the Republicans were more beholden to money.  I was simply adding that both sides are equally beholden, just to different parts of the money system.

       I mean yeah, that's kind of my whole point. Perhaps I phrased it wrong, but we're both arguing the same point. I suppose a better way to phrase would be to say 'while both sides serve the same masters, it's become obvious that one does so without hiding behind a facade of social welfare or some general public benefactor, while the other attempts to do so discretely. Kind of semantics really, but the point remains the same which we both seem to agree on. I imagine it'd be hard to not agree with it, pretty damned general lol

       The way I look at it, is yes the Democrats are
       <em>
        driven
       </em>
       towards some of the same goals (power, money etc), but they're at least willing to throw the populace a bone on the way to those ends.  They're willing to take care of the people in exchange for the power and money and authority.  Republicans... they want it all,
       <em>
        and
       </em>
       they want to fuck you in the process.
      </p>
      <p>
       So yes, they're both "equally shitty" except for the way that one of them is way more shitty.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, the same sort of reform can fix the problems that both parties suffer from (money in politics).  But that doesn't really mean that everything else is equal.

       Obviously the broad statements aren't aimed at you or refuting your post at all, just furthering it with my own opinion.

       Honestly I think republicans are worse, straight up. But I also acknowledge I'm coming at this with multiple biases, and am nowhere near an expert on any of this. If someone shows me a point of view that says otherwise I will gladly accept it and work it into my beliefs. The problem is, look at the response I got to my OP.
      </p>
      <p>
       I literally started off saying that just because I'm not addressing the existence of shitty things the left does, doesn't meant I don't see them, recognize them or think they should be addressed. It's just not related directly to the topic of my post. That's all. I then even go to say that I'm probably coming at this with a bias because it's easier to see Republican flaws when the majority of government is Republican.
      </p>
      <p>
       And what are the response? Bringing up shit Obama did, bringing up shit Hillary did (did we forget she isn't, and wasn't ever fucking president? Why is she being talked about, I certainly didn't mention anything even loosely related to her) and trying to prove that democrats are actually worse than republicans and therefore I'm wrong. Like, literally a neutral stance that both sides sucks draws attacks. I don't get it. Nobody even addressed what I said, they just bring up past tense opposites.

       You almost got it.  Trump is the American Empire in raw form.  Difficult to digest, isn't it?  Obama made the same shit go down easier with his sugar tongue.  And that's what people want - someone to convincingly lie to them that everything done in their name is "good."

       What are you talking about? My whole post was about how both sides are the same, but just due to the government being predominantly Republican right now it comes off as worse right this second. So you're point is that... both sides are the same but they talk differently? Yeah.. good point..

       The Republicans are definitely more beholden to business interests
       <strong>
        in regards to the transparency with which they appease the oligarchs that rule this planet
       </strong>
       . Democrats are just far better at concealing their business interests with half truths and emotionally charged "social justice" rhetoric, which appeals to the youth demographic. Republicans on the other hand don't conceal themselves with optics, and I believe there is a reason for that. The Business party wants us to fight each other over the conversation they are literally moderating, and the Republicans are being intentionally painted as representing the "bad" ideology (conservatism) so that the progressive "pro-government" end of the force fed political spectrum will ultimately prevail and allow the government to manifest itself as the seat of their monopoly. It's every Capitalist's wet dream.

       Thank you!! Exactly. Finally someone actually fucking read what I said and didnt just immediately jump to "no you're wrong democrats are worse!" Like this shit is exactly what the 'business' party wants from the populace. Stagnated ideals not focused on progress, but on opposition and constant distraction. They both go about it differently, but they both play the role. This was the dialogue I wanted to start... unfortunately I got a bunch of "but Obama did X".

       It is a bit ironic really. More so sad and disheartening though. What could possibly be more bipartisan/neutral than saying we both want what's best for this country? If that can't spark some form of constructive dialogue, idk what can. It's hard to not be apathetic when this really seems to be the new norm; animosity and hatred towards anyone with a differing opinion. I mean shit, at it's absolute most fundamental level, this is exactly how civil wars start (in extreme early stages). 2 different opinions who see the only thing stopping their opinion/belief from becoming reality is the opposing opinion, while both are relentlessly unwilling to compromise or admit fault/wrongness.

       Man, I mean it's refreshing this reply wasn't another "but Obama did x", but it's still beside the point I was making. Trump is a symptom of our disgustingly corrupt government. He's the most obvious depiction of it that we've had, 100%, but generally speaking both parties are guilty of self enriching and lopsided policies to the general public and this dynamic of Republican obvious corruption and democratic discrete corruption is all part of the system and part of the problem. Placing all blame or even majority of blame on one side wasn't what I was trying to do or the point I was trying to make. It was that the system of our government is now designed to divide the population against each other. To essentially split the collective manpower of the general populace in half. It's a paradigm and the only conceivable way to alter it is to work together and not see each other as enemies. We're all Americans. We all want the same thing; to perpetuate America's prosperity and health for as long as possible. We're not each other's enemies, the political and business elites essentially are. And they reach across both parties.

       Well, what do people expect when there is no actual "left" in the states? You have the right (Dems) and the bat shit insane right (GOP) when comparing them to any other "normal" political spectrum in the world. Of course they will be the same thing, because both are right leaning, if not full right parties already.

       I don't disagree with what you're saying, but I think it's a little off of what my initial point was. The problem, at it's fundamental level is not one party or the other. It's the system in which they're both in servitude of; as I colloquially said before, the business class. As long as any politician, left or right, is beholding to the political/financial/business elite over the general public, we will continually, and indefinitely face problems economically, socially and politically. The system of government from top to bottom (exceptions to every rule obviously, but apparently I have to mention this in this sub)  is designed, maintained and operating in a fashion that predicates politicians to forsake their constituents for the elites they're beholding to. A politicians job, almost by definition, is to get re-elected. Since we now have given money a voice, and there are several people/groups that have more money than people in the US (oversimplification) they have more power over the 're election of a good majority of politicians than we do. And With the general populace divided and focused on each other, the elite nearly has free reign over what they want. All that is needed for this is a divided but placated populace, and enough distraction and scapegoating (often of the opposing party to further the divide while also occupying time) to give the elite and politicians enough breathing room to sabotage and self enrich by essentially buying key politicians and their votes.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've said this several times, but I don't think anyone, Republican, or democrat will disagree. A true American, is someone who (again, oversimplification and generalizing) wants America to continually improve, to grow it's prosperity, and to be the best country in the world. Every single true American wants that. They might want to go about it in different ways, but we all want the same thing. Do you know the only group who doesn't want That? It's not your opposing party, it's the entire government system (with a few exceptions obviously). We need to stop fighting, and hating each other and instead work together. We all want the same thing, 99% of us aren't experts or even arguably informed enough to have the strong opinions that we do, but as long as we share the goal of bettering America, there's no conflict, just differing opinions on how to reach the same goal.

       There is a left, and it manifests itself the same way the left always inevitably does. "Liberty" is the moniker, coercion and ostracism is the weapon. It makes perfect sense and the left is doing what they -ALWAYS- do.

       I don't even live in the US I am a neutral 3rd part with zero stake in the whole thing. Yes the left exists with people and though processes, but it sure as fuck doesn't exist as something with any political power or voting presence. Anyone who legitimately believes that there is an actual left political party in the US with any semblance of power is the one with the scrambled brain. American politics are shifted so far right its not even a debate topic at this point in time.

       I disagree. And I would add not being in the US makes no difference to your neutrality or knowledge. Certainly no authority.

       The left is the the left no matter where you live, and they are everywhere. Things mutate and you have to follow the pattern.
      </p>
      <p>
       But you did say everything is the fault of the right. It is absolutely implied by your statement. You're caught up in sentimentality and have no gauge on the truth. You have it construed in your head that the left is virtuous, and until you detect virtue, there can be no left. And if you detect virtue, then you will confirm the left. And that is a black philosophy.

       I will not take it as a neutral post because it is absolute horse shit, and that is me being polite about it. You think you're neutral, but you are not. You are just completely enveloped in some delusion that ignores reality.

      <p>
       My entire argument is that the US does not have a "true" (whatever the fuck that means is up to you I guess, but I am assuming a global "middle" that includes places like AU/Nz, the Nordics, EU, Canada etc,) left. This is not good or bad, this just is, the right has done as many good things for the US as it has bad because that's all there has been for a long time. Like jesus fuck, not every viewpoint has to be evil or against you, that train of though is what causes shit like the nazis in the first place.

       No, my entire argument is predicated on the fact that you declared implicitly that the right is to blame for all things bad. That is inarguable in the content of your statement because you said absolutely that the left doesn't exist. What is arguable is why you would think such a stupid thing. And, given my experiences of the last 20 years, I readily believe that people ARE that stupid.

       Democratic Party:
* Increase tax revenue in the top tax bracket
* Increase minimum wage for lower class people that haven't seen a raise in decades
* Provide job retraining/secondary education opportunities for lower class people in dying job markets
* cheaper healthcare for all
* Rebuild nation's public infrastructure

       Republican Party:
* More tax breaks for the top tax brackets
* Keep minimum wage stagnant and in some places lower it
* Keep on digging coal miners and keep on building car factory workers, these jobs will totally last forever
* Keep the unnecessary middle men insurance companies so that they can profit off of people's lives and health
* Sell nation's public infrastructure to private entities to be tolled

       In the past decade the Democratic party had only been in power for two years and during that time implemented the ACA as well as raised percentage of the top tax bracket back up after the disastrous Bush era tax cuts. I would like to see what they did that you claim is socialism/welfare for corporations.

       Not kidding at all! The court case began as an attempt to removing the ability for a PAC to fund a film specifically about her.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        In the case, the conservative non-profit organization Citizens United wanted to air a film critical of
        <strong>
         Hillary Clinton
        </strong>
        and to advertise the film during television broadcasts shortly before the 2008 Democratic primary election in which Clinton was running for U.S. President.

       I'm in no way supporting either side, to be clear.
      </p>
      <p>
       But the fact is that she fought the law, and the law won - and it made that legal shady thing very publicly visible, causing more exploitation of that shady thing than a smaller case would have.
      </p>
      <p>
       If she had not brought a non-profit to court to selfishly protect her own personal image, the precedent would not be currently inscribed, and likely would remain known to very few.

       Yeah if you look at how democrats vote and Republicans vote it's very obvious not the same. About half of the democrats actually vote for things that help the little guy. But pretty much all of the Republicans vote for things that will help big corporations.

       People forget that basically every major city in the country is liberal and most are wonderful places. They're the places people want to move to or be near. How close a town is to big cities is one of the measurements of that towns appeal.

       grumpieroldman's whole schtick is just rhetoric from the right. Their whole strategy is finding one example of bad liberals and then tell their whole base "Well that's ALL of them!" For anyone still reading, here's a list of the dem/repub breakdown per mayor of cities:

       Yes, EVERY city that democrats run - NY, LA, Honolulu, Nashville, Orlando, Norfolk, etc. etc. etc. are ALL shitholes. Only the ones that repubs run, like Chandler, AZ and Jacksonville Florida AREN'T. (eye roll)

       That was true about 100 years ago.
       <br/>
       All of the major American cities today are ruined shitholes.

       There was glimor of hope in the 90's with a broad multifaceted approach making a difference (from policing efforts to 'positive' affects of easy access to abortion) and due to effert from the likes of Rudy Giuliani. That momentum skidded to a halt in the naughts.

       Why are all democrat cities shit holes? We'll. 1st. Let's address the fact that that's not remotely true? In fact it's quite the opposite, Republican controlled areas are in dire straights while cities, which are almost exclusively democrat voted and run throughout the country, are our economic and education centers. Without democrat controlled cities, the US would essentially be China Or Russia, at best.

       Thank you for that. I love Chomsky, but he is not perfect either. You have to actually look at policy and it doesn't take but a few minutes to determine that Democrats are the people's party. Sometimes it does mean working with corporations and people together for a common goal or cause. Republicans are straight up only about helping the rich, they never have policies to actually help working class people...ever. There's a big difference and I can't stand the laziness of people simply spouting off they are both the same. Facts show otherwise.

       The Dems wouldn't have propped Hillary up throughout the primaries, both literally and figuratively, if they were actually the people's party. The DNC is in currently in court disputing this very topic. Their defense for being dishonest to their political donors is that they are a private organization and can do as they wish. Does this sound like "the people's party"? Our two party system is corrupt across the board. We need transparency from our leaders and money out of politics.

       We call this an absolute.  No, this proves nothing of the sort.  Even so she was the most qualified candidate of any of the candidates period, like her or not and like it or not it is the truth.  She received the most votes in the primaries and won.  I voted for the Bern man, I was angry when he didn't win, but not at the DNC.  I was mad at my own brethren who could not see that this was a change election and people did not want more of the same. Hillary did represent much of the status quo and this is why she lost.  Also, while the DNC made some shitty comments, none of it actually related to an unfair advantage in my humble opinion.  Sorry, but this one issue is not enough to condemn an entire party for.  Besides, look at Republicans.  They have no standards.  They reek of bigotry, racism and corporatism, yet they won and nobody held them to a higher standard.  You are not perfect, nor am I and neither is the DNC.  That's life, but some are far worse than others for example (Trump, Republicans, KKK, Nazis, Fascists, Religious Zealots, etc...) The choice for rational people was clear and considering 3,000,000 more people voted for Hillary it is safe to assume the rational people outweighed the bigots.

       Sure.  The optics are bad for the DNC, but I am afraid this is about par with deflate-gate.  Yes, the Patriots deflated the football, but most likely the patriots were going to win anyway.  Bernie could not garner the over 40 African American vote and it cost him the primary.  Even with Hillary's "come to heel" comments, black people still voted for her in force. There was very little the DNC did to make that happen.  Let's face it, they love them some Billy on a sax.  Sorry man.  It just wasn't going to happen anyway. Should I be upset?  Sure.  Does it mean I am going to vote for a Nazi?  How about a bigot?  Maybe a con-man like Trump?  How about a religious zealot/booger eating Ted Cruz?  Na.  I will stick with the only party who gives two fucks about civil rights, working class people and the environment. It is not a hard decision to make. Should we work to fix the problems in the DNC? Sure, but it doesn't mean I am willing to burn the country down for it.  That would be amateur and stupid.

       Read my comment history. I did not feel the way I do now. Now that Trump/Republicans own .gov the decision is simple. Stop Republicans at all costs. Their betrayal and silence on Trump is deafening. My new slogan is "Stop a Nazi, Vote Democrat". As far as the DNC goes...well they will get more Progressive over time, they will not have a choice. I'm not going to let this cause a rift.

       Ok, and every Republican I know thinks the same thing. "Stop the Dems at all cost".. and there you have it, a country stuck fighting against each other's interests while the rich get richer and whoever gets elected on either side immediately acquieses to the will of the elites. You and I lose again and again and again with this pointing the finger bullshit.

       You're ridiculously naive if you believe this.  They have showed no signs of going left whatsoever in the last 30 years ever since Bill Clinton took over the party.

       It's already happening. Please spare me the emo act, "My life is a deep dark abyss". Boo fucking hoo. Did it ever occur to you the whole reason we have this runaway government is because people like us decided to do nothing? We became complacent and got the shitty government we deserved. Sorry, you do injustice to those who have the balls to go out and fight for what they believe in. Change is coming, but it is slow and requires people to give a fuck. So either you can go back to cutting yourself or you can get involved and make a difference. Your life.

       You have an infantile view of politics if you think that this is how politics is practiced. But thank you for making a ninth grade level outline on how the two sides differ...
      </p>
      <p>
       The bottom line for the federal government is continuity. As long as they're able to keep their lobby money flowing in, thus guaranteeing re-election, it doesn't really matter what actually happens.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean, your precious Democratic party practiced the "just for the elite" line of thinking during the primaries. They essentially said to the voters, "Even though a huge percentage of you support one candidate, we have invested way too much time/money/campaign promises in our other candidate to let the better one win."
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, you know the Democratic party attempted (and probably succeeded in) aiding Trump's Republican party efforts. Also, you know that the Democratic proposal for military spending actually exceeded Trump's plan? Did you know that we sold billions of dollars of weaponry to unstable nations during Obama's presidency that is literally being used for terrorism? Where did that money go? It certainly wasn't levied off to the poor - it goes to the checking accounts of the politicians who sign off on this shit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nobody's disagreeing with the idea that the Democratic party theoretically has better ideas in terms of equity for the poor. However, the world (and especially politics) is not a fairy tale where good and evil are clearly defined and you can just side with the good people and they will destroy the evil. You just need to inform yourself.

       Please indicate where I suggested the Democratic party was perfect. I merely said to that they are not the same as the Republicans. While both have flaws, to say they are equally flawed is laughable.

       And wow, no shit they're not exactly the same. But as far as equally flawed goes, they are.. for the reasons I just mentioned.. because they don't actually care about the issues they just care about re-election and keeping the status quo. But if just saying that you care about poor people is good enough for you then.. good for you I guess? You're still uninformed though.

       My state passed medical marijuana (2010-2011ish) and a min. wage increase (just came into effect this year). There was only one party that fought tooth and nail against both of these things prior to and after their inceptions, and it wasn't the Democrats.

       Both parties are flawed, but it's obvious that one party is much more heavily flawed and completely out of touch with reality.

       I know one more party is flawed than the other but that doesn't excuse the other party from being extremely flawed... Why does it have to be a pissing contest? The Democratic party being less shitty than the Republican party does not make up for them being shitty themselves.

       For someone who mentioned something about nuance, you sure don't seem to have much of an understanding about it. It's so lazy to take the "both parties being shitty so fuck everything" stance. There will never be a perfect political party, so we will have to accept flaws that come with them. Look at the voting logs and tell me which party is more anti-consumer and anti-middle/working class. I mean, god damn, just look at the votes regarding campaign finance measures. I think we can agree that the endless flow of money in politics is a problem in the country. Well, there's one party who is fighting against it and one that is trying to pass reform.

       That's not my stance. We absolutely do not need to accept the flaws that come with them.

       If I have to choose within the confines of a bipartisan system then I'm 100% a Democrat; that doesn't mean I can't also view them as corrupt.
      </p>
      <p>
       Furthermore, viewed through the lens of the original post that we are all commenting on (read: establishment tactics), we can say that Democrats and Republicans alike do engage in that sort of behavior in order to keep themselves in power.
      </p>
      <p>
       To illustrate the Democratic Party as a conglomerate participating in establishment tactics to maintain the status quo, we need to look no farther than the Democratic primaries. I disagree that much of anything is being done, on either side, to combat it.

       You have poor reading comprehension skills if you think that my argument was about what specific things parties have done for specific voters..
      </p>
      <p>
       I was talking about how both sides care more about protecting their status than they do about catering to their constituents. The reason is because lobby money correlates to winning an election more than any other factor; research the subject if you do not believe me.
      </p>
      <p>
       The point of his post was that democrats aren't on the same side of the coin as republicans because some of their policies are better for more people. I was saying that what goes on behind the scenes is more important and there is a shit ton of corruption on both sides.

       And all I would need to do is look at actual policy to see where each party stands. I don't even have to look at their idealogies to know where each party stands.

       Okay, yeah that's what I thought. You're just missing the point. Go back and read the posts again. This has nothing to do with Democratic or Republican policies; literally nothing. I'm not explaining it again because I don't know how many different ways I can say the same thing.

       The point of the original post was that OP was tired of people saying that Reps and Dems are the same, then he posted a bunch of random bullet points about some differences in policy and how Democratic policies are more progressive - and suggested that proves that Democrats are not the party for the elite...
      </p>
      <p>
       So if his point was that Dems and Reps aren't the same because they have different policies and the Democratic ones are better, then it was a stupid post. Everyone knows they have different policies - and anyone with an even cursory knowledge of politics knows which way each side leans.
      </p>
      <p>
       When we say that both sides are "for the elite," it is referring to the idea that, at the end of the day, Democrats and Republicans alike are more interested and
       <strong>
        will do more to protect their elite status than they will for any of their constituents wants and needs.
       </strong>
       This is what people mean when they say both sides are for the elites. Read the bolded part. Read it again and again. That is the main point of the argument and the heart of the issue.
      </p>
      <p>
       Both sides are more self-interested than they are public servants. That is as concise as I can put it.

       I'm typically in favor of democrats, and going beyond that the "one business party two branches" approach, and because of the latter part I get the impression a lot of the time that the bills that Democrats are usually in favor of (like the ones listed above) are for show. So they can hold them up to voters and say "See! We're trying!" when in reality there's little to no chance they'll go through. It's just to keep the working and middle classes in the mindset that at least there are people out there fighting for them, when in reality it's just to prevent any (more) widespread unrest.

       Hmm. That's a good post.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not sure we can equate Hillary Clinton to be quite the liar Donald Trump is, but I we probably shouldn't community-diagnose either of them as pathological liars.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's people's responsibility not to be conned, though. Everyone had the chance for vote for Hillary's better policies, or to vote for Trump's silly policies. Anyone who cast a vote for him has only themselves to blame. The propaganda machine is only turned-on during the election season, and it's no good figuring out you've been conned when all the cards are already laid on the table. Half the country figured it out; the other half needs to smarten-up, fast.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm probably putting myself half-way into the shooting gallery by saying this, but I don't think Trump is that much of a racist. I think he probably has a little racism in him - as a man who grew-up decades ago in America - and is willing to turn a blind eye to white supremacy because it suits him politically, but I find it hard to believe that he fundamentally has a major racist streak in him.

       As for Hillary and Trump and diagnosing them as pathological liars, why not exactly? What exactly does it take?
      </p>
      <p>
       In my opinion, politicians like Hillary are being normalized through the Overton Window, because the Trump presidency normalizes such unfathomably insane things, that the corrupt practices we previously tried to ameliorate pale in comparison.
      </p>
      <p>
       This leads to instances where Clinton and even George W. Bush are rehabilitated as "decent leadership". I don't really feel like dog-whistling the alt-right crowd but I have a long list of grievances with Clinton which have nothing do with things like "Pizzagate" or Seth Rich, but just with her treatment of civil and digital rights, censorship and surveillance, treatment of whistleblowers, gay marriage, wealth distribution, corporatism, cronyism, international law &amp; human rights and transparency/accountability.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump's presidency completely eclipses and normalizes most of that, and the thought of ever having leadership with some genuine integrity in Washington again now seems completely out of reach.
      </p>
      <p>
       Especially with the current trend of lionizing George W. Bush and a mish-mash of other authoritarian conservatives now criticizing Trump and looking "good" by comparison.

       Yes, I know what you mean. But it just gets tiresome being the only person in the room who is outraged. Stuff just gets normalized over time. Isn't anyone appalled that corporations can just... spend as much money as they like lobbying politicians. Isn't that just bribery?

       Sometimes we forget that George W Bush took us to a war that killed tens of thousands, all over a piece of evidence that it turned out he completely fabricated - him infamous WOMD. Completely made up. The whole reason for that war. A total lie. And it's just... water under the bridge. Why would anyone vote for the GOP again, considering that it is a fact that their last President did this? I don't get it. Do people just have memories like a sieve?

       I believe Trump is both mentally ill and a compulsive liar. But to say that belief cannot be justified unless Trump is personally examined: I'm sorry, given the preponderance of public evidence, I can't accept that.

       Clinton, that may be significantly harder. Then again, that assertion, too, may have been influenced and skewed by the horrendously high bar set by Trump and his endless, compulsive lying.

       Other than that, I agree with what you said, and I'm glad other recognize the dangers of rehabilitating someone like Dubya.

       I had a read about this, first on The Independent, and then on Snopes - I was not aware of this being a thing, really. Despite recent conservative-bashing, I personally find Snopes has always been a reliable (and quick) source of weighing-up the truth of a disputed matter, especially since it provides references wherever possible.
      </p>
      <p>
       What's true, according to Snopes:
       <em>
        A 1927 New York Times article named Fred Trump among the individuals arrested after a "near-riot" involving the KKK and New York City policemen at a "Memorial parade."
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       What's false, according to Snopes:
       <em>
        The article did not document that Fred Trump was a KKK member or supporter, or that he was charged with a crime in connection with the KKK event.
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       Perhaps rather more telling, is Trump's (hilarious) response:
       <em>
        "It never happened. And by the way, I saw that it was one little website that said it. It never happened. And they said there were no charges, no nothing. It’s unfair to mention it, to be honest, because there were no charges. They said there were charges against other people, but there were absolutely no charges, totally false … Somebody showed me that website — it was a little website and somebody did that. By the way, did you notice that there were no charges? Well, if there are no charges that means it shouldn’t be mentioned … Because my father, there were no charges against him, I don’t know about the other people involved. But there were zero charges against him. So assuming it was him — I don’t even think it was him, I never even heard about it. So it’s really not fair to mention. It never happened."
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       Trivia: Donald states that his father is not guilty a total of
       <em>
        eleven times
       </em>
       , in that - rather odd- verbal reply to a journalist.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes, I must admit that Donald's father certainly seems to have a bit of a racist streak, although how much that wears-off on Donald himself, well~, I dunno. I'm ignorant of prior racist dealings he's had.

       I suppose there's little benefit to either of us to argue this, seeing as how we agree on nearly everything else, but I'm sticking to the facts and the medical industry as best I can. If you are a medical professional with sufficient qualifications and experience in the field of mental health to suggest this may be case with Trump, then your word has credence with me, otherwise it doesn't. Diagnosis by medically-unqualified members of the public, or 'diagnosis by community', is not medically valid.
      </p>
      <p>
       The reason I make this point, is because I've had several arguments with conservatives who had some sort of bizarre, innate hatred of transgender individuals, and were very happy when Trump banned them from serving in the military. These people seemed to be convinced that transgenderism was a mental illness, which it is not. When these discussions I had reached the absolute crux of the matter, sticking to the DSM-V is the only sensible thing to do. When someone (as happened in these arguments) then declares the DSM (and by association, the APA) to be untrue, their argument immediately crumbles, as it is impossible to argue that a world without up-to-date medical texts is superior to the one in which we live.

       I think you're wrong.  With cost of living, $200K is what our parents were making in the old days adjusted for inflation and dollar value.  Now throw on huge cost of education our parents didn't have.  Throw on rising home prices.  That $200K is not going far, especially for a family of 4.  These people are the new middle class.  The problem is that the old middle class has simply been downgraded to lower-middle class.  Just because some people don't have kids anymore so they can be "rich" on a six-figure salary doesn't mean they are rich.  They are just making other sacrifices.

       Sure, and $7.25 might not be realistic.  But neither is $15.  And neither is a FEDERAL minimum wage.  Perhaps a federally-mandated, state-based wage.  And automation will take over, yes, but you can screw small business in the process or not...We can grow into automation healthily, but instead we are going to expedite the process and experience a lot of growing pain.

       My response covered vocational schools too.  I love trade schools, but people like Hillary would have you think "college or no opportunity".  There is definitely a liberal stigma surrounding trade schools.  Also, you can't just throw money at these often unaccredited trade schools.  Basically, I was arguing that vocational schools are an afterthought in the Democratic agenda and that could do more harm than good.

       Yes, and I can choose not to have insurance.  Voila!  And my insurance won't come out cheaper.  Under Obamacare, some people saw increases, others saw reductions.  That's just how it will happen.  Also, name another country in the world that has the population size and diversity of America.  Any developed nation with public healthcare is either small, or the service sucks.  Also, your cost argument is true, but the issue is not health insurance costs--it's medical costs.  We have the highest cost of medicince of any country too.  Because we make doctors pay for school, malpractice insurance, etc.  Change the education system and healthcare wouldn't be as expensive.  But then doctors wouldn't make six-figure salaries.

       If you haven't realized yet, this sub has been transformed to an alt-right infested hole quite a while back. All the comments that are on the top are coordinated. They want to now establish equivalency between both sides and the shameless attempts are extremely evident. It's all bull. There is no consequential far-left. There is a very consequential far-right and when they reared their heads they killed and injured innocent civilians because they didn't like what they had to say.

       Well u didnt mention that in your reply did you?  Also it most definitely is true. I'm pretty sure you won't be able to recall any far-left organization without Googling it but we know far-right organizations at the tip of our tongues because they are as old as day. What's obvious is how you tried to potray what I said inaccurately. This is a classic trumper tactic.

       Alt-right takes complete power: Undesirables are sent to death camps, meanwhile an invasion of the Soviet Union and Western Europe takes place. Non-conformity is met with summary execution or exile.

       Alt-left takes complete power: Fathers are given more weeks of paternity leave, quality of life tops the charts. But yea I guess taxes are kind of high, but its not so bad really because you cant go medically bankrupt and end up on the streets.

       Yeah the alt-left never did anything, they only killed about 100 million people in the last 100 years, as opposed to the alt-right's what, 12 million to be generous. These are the numbers before military conflict, so maybe you can argue that it is about 25 million(this number excludes the killing of Chinese civilians as the regime that killed them was less right-wing than basically any other regime in Japanese history). Even if we include that number, we only increase up to 45 million people assuming that every civilian that died was the fault of the direct actions of the so called alt right, while excluding the same for the communists I had named.

       Heather Heyer was not Antifa, and she was the innocent civilian that ended up dead at the hands of white supremacists/nationalists/Nazis. Many of the counter protestors hurt were not Antifa and had permits to be there. I agree that Antifa has been violent and I don't agree with the use of violence but there is a clear distinction between the side that calculatedly ran over a crowd of protestors, killing one (coincidentally, like the radical Islamists that they love to bunch up with moderate Muslims,) and the side that hasn't.

       Baseball shooting - Mentally deranged lone wolf attack which was a politically motivated attack. It wasn't even remotely meant for innocents. It was still inconsequential. Scalise is attending Congress now.
      </p>
      <p>
       BLM, Antifa burning down cities - Bullshit propaganda fed to you courtesy of Russians and the alt-right. But you're probably part of it so I really don't see a point in arguing with nazi sympathizers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nazi attacks like the one in Charlottesville, the train attack in portland, the racists attack that killed hindu Indian engineers perceived to be muslim, the dylann roof attack. But yeah keep sympathizing with the Nazi's and falsely equating them. All these attacks have been artificially incited by the far-right leaders and sympathizers like Donald Trump.

       I never said it's OK did I? Stop pushing words and stop spreading your propaganda. Communism in USA ? Ok. Is this cantwell's account? He says the exact same thing when someone "maced" him. ("Fuckin commies did this") The truth is there is no coordinated far-left but the alt-right is organized and ready to unleash havoc on US soil. But keep pushing your god emperor's both are the same narrative.

       I had more pressing videos but they all had cringy  titles. Thought they would put you off. Anyhow, yea from what I've seen a LOT of antifa seem to believe in socialist/anticapitalist/communist ideologies. Not really pushing any propaganda, and what is this "havoc on us soil" you speak of? I haven't heard of any, sounds like p r o p a g a n d a to me.  Also I really don't think there is a need for violence, I understand when black people were discriminated against, but I don't see why there needs to be violence here.

       I was referring to the vice video that you know 100 million people of the world watched. Which is you know by verifiable and accountable press... Which you will obviously refer to as "fake news" inspite of video evidence of your nazi friends literally saying that on national television. Just like your nazi president sympathizing with the Nazi's and being as Hitler as contemporaneously possible right before everyone's fucking eyes but you will still ignore that because of your cognitive dissonance and things that go against your confirmation your bias. Yup but you better soak in all your propaganda, or your skin might go black...

       I agree, but what many people don't see or remember is how the political cycle works. It's all but certain at this point that the next president will be a Dem. The problem is they will be an establishment Dem and will uphold the same shitty economic and political policies that are disenfranchising Americans both on the right and left. After their term we will assuredly get another shithead "anti-establishment" populist Republican like Trump... or worse. People seem to have forgotten that the ground for Trump was laid by Bush and Obama continued many of the Bush admins destructive economic policies which lead to voter backlash.

       I'm sorry, but this is just willfully ignorant. Their are many hard Left-leaning commentators, journalists, and academics that are followed by the left leaning conspiracy community. Chomsky, Pilger, Moyers, Hedges, Blythe, Klein, Curtis, Joseph, and many others, that have all been marginalized by the mainstream media for being critical of the Dem/liberal establishment.

       So it's not true or just not complete?  What about the collusion to defraud Bernie?   There seems to be a lawsuit progressing nicely on that,  what about Debbie Wassmer-Shultz and her feeding Hillary questions and her current mess with her IT guy?  What Bernie being under investigation, not to mention Anthony Wiener,  we could keep going but I am sure you will stick to Democrats are stand up american and really care about you.  I know you can't reach people who don't want to listen but corruption runs deep in both parties.

       It more than Hillary and you know this.  Bernie being investigated by FBI Debbie and her IT mess and cheating, Anthony Wiener etc etc. we could keep going both are corrupt and gross. There is a lawsuit going on about just this topic. Sure one is worse but if you want to be king of the trash pile go ahead.  Nothing like taking the position well Dems suck less so support them,  how about we hold everyone to new standard of maybe not sucking.

       Quick question mr Bot,  who voted for all the free trades, TPP and other things,  why are these votes not going further back to say clinton or other democrats.  It seems when you cherry pick facts almost as if you are trying to correct a record of sorts.  It's ironic that you honestly beliebe saying this over and over again changes the fact that both parties are the same.

       Who works for Wall Street?  Who goes in as regular people and come out loaded from lobbyist?  Who sold US resources to the Russians or Chinese?  Who has made side deals to benefit or profit from war, natural disasters or other public upheavals.  See like the answer is everyone.  So your talking points are fake as shit time to get a new story

       Just an anecdote so obviously it's not the be-all, end-all, but it's still interesting. We recently approved a voter proposition in my state to raise the min. wage from $8.05 to $12 by 2020 (gradual annual increases, we're at $10/hour right now). It was passed overwhelmingly by voters.
      </p>
      <p>
       Guess who fought the hardest to kill the bill? Republican state senators and representatives, as well as the "chamber of commerce" which is really just a republican stronghold/think tank masquerading as a chamber of commerce in this state. They told us the effects would be devastating to the state and it would cripple small business.
      </p>
      <p>
       Guess what? It hasn't. The state's economy is strong, businesses are coming here, and there's a fuckton of new restaurants (the ones who would arguably be hit the hardest by a payroll increase) slated to open in 2018.

       Democrats have their flaws, but in our modern political landscape they are objectively a better option for the working/middle class.

       its moreso the belief that private institutions will be significantly more efficient than any government operation, which is true. Realistically the cheapest course of action is going to be selling contracts and enforcing government safety standards (aka how we go about just about everything) The government itself is horribly inefficient with labor as their is no incentive for profit. That is the whole point of contention between democrat and republican. They toe the line of too much regulation or too little regulation. Neither side is inherently wrong or misguided. Both can be right in different situations.

       I'm an infrequent poster here, but I think it's important to say this: economic inequality is literally the #1 thing the left is concerned about. Socio-economic division is the basis of leftist (not centrist democrat) ideology.
      </p>
      <p>
       That said, if you go back 6-7 years and listen to Alex Jones, and ignore the chem trails and lizard stuff, it sounds fairly similar to standard leftist talking points now. He used to actually interview leftist orgs than were being infiltrated by the feds when Obama was pres.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not sure how being concerned with wealth inequality and powerful banks gave way to hating personalities aka establishment Dems, then electing a literal billionaire from New York, but here we are.

       Chem trails are confirmed. They are a conspiracy fact not a theory.

       The most nefarious case is when the CIA dropped LSD on an entire town in France.

       The part the "chemtrails" theory gets wrong, is that the fluffy white lines that planes leave behind them in the sky is evidence of this.  It's evidence of nothing other than physics.

       The Left has done nothing about economic inequality. The number 1 positive thing to do in that regard would be to increase capital gains taxes. Nobody will even talk about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Raising minimum wage is a smoke screen. Dems had the votes to do it right after Obama's election, but didn't even try. Obamacare is a right wing healthcare plan literally created by the Heritage Foundation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Dems talk a lot about economic inequality but don't actually do anything to fix it. So, I'd say they aren't actually concerned at all. Liberals cheered when the Supreme Court said Obamacare gave the government the right to tax people too poor to afford health insurance. Outside of Sanders, no liberal actually wants single payer universal healthcare. Attempt to raise minimum wage can't even get 100% Dem support unless the Republicans have a majority.
      </p>
      <p>
       Actions speak louder than words. The Left's number one priority right now is attacking Trump. That's literally all they've done since Trump was sworn in.

       Dems != the left. I'm incredibly left, socioeconomic inequality is the main focus point of my beliefs. "Leftists" seek to end the class divide that creates and solidifies that inequality.
      </p>
      <p>
       Many on the left despise the dems, me especially. They've advanced many programs that I viscerally disagree with, drone program, mass spying, supporting lobbying to the point where they've opened the door to regulatory capture (though that's more the republicans bag). They will only serve to enforce the DoB, as both parties are set up to do.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you talk with many of your leftist countrymen, ones that identify as leftists rather than liberal, I think you'll find that many are more concerned about the continual oppression and inequity of the lower classes than anything else.

       The mainstream left might be concerned with these things, but the ones making the news are out in the streets, fighting for wedge issues that are nearly inconsequential in the face of the inequality you mention.  It's almost like the far left and far right are on the same team, the team that got Trump (or Hillary, wouldn't have mattered) into office instead of the one candidate that cared about your issue.

       It's weird to make this argument at a time that the left is protesting against actual nazi demonstrators.

       Have you seen the images of these "protests"?  A handful of pathetic "nazis" and thousands of counter-protesters basically amplifying their pathetic message.  If they were just ignored, they would have no power, but the left gives them the biggest media bullhorn while the politicians carry on as before.

       I strongly disagree-- this attention is a good thing. The left needs to draw more people to its side if we're going to have any kind of reordering of society away from moneyed elites, or any hope of addressing some of the massive problems we face as a society.
      </p>
      <p>
       These protest/counterprotests with nazis might draw more attention to the nazis than they'd otherwise get, but it also shows the nascent power of the rising populist left groups like the DSA. Liberalism has failed, and they've allowed rightwing fascism to creep in the gaps. Every time Trump tacitly defends the nazis, and leftist groups show their strength, the future gets a little brighter.

       Bernie Sanders filled stadiums and never had to rely on protesting nazism or any other fringe group.  The way to inspire the vast electorate is to shine light on what the billionaire class has done to the country, not focus on a few inbreds with confederate flags.  Identity politics and wedge issue politics gets you Trump.

       It's both. Like it or not Trump won
       <em>
        because of
       </em>
       identity politics (white ethnonationalism) not in spite of it, or because of some silly argument about internet feminists. If we want to beat rightwing fascism we need to create a competitive identity, not pretend identity doesn't matter.

       That's the media narrative, but most Trump voters were acting purely on economics.  One candidate was obviously hostage to Wall Street while another was promising to "drain the swamp".  Whatever the media has twisted the message into now, after the Russia narrative failed, does not change this fact.

       I think it's pretty safe to say that what
       <em>
        you're
       </em>
       saying is the false narrative here. Clinton polled better on issues such as handling of the economy, but she wasn't winning those votes, which means there were confounding factors there. And "Drain the swamp" wasn't an economic message at all, but an anti-corruption one (one of the factors, for sure, but a non-economic one).
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump
       <em>
        did
       </em>
       racebait constantly in his rallies and campaign ads, by using dog whistles such as chicago violence and mexican immigration, and many others. You're whitewashing his campaign which isn't helpful for figuring out how to beat him
       <em>
        or
       </em>
       appeal to his voters.
      </p>
      <p>
       BUT, I do agree that the way to win is through an economic populist message. It's not the trump voters we have to win, it's the NON-voters.

       I think you are reading this exactly backwards.  Go to the places you lost and ask them how they read it.  No one likes the nazis but you aren't winning anyone over.  Everyone just thinks you are talking about bullshit.  People are worried about real things like health care and jobs and education.
      </p>
      <p>
       More likely explanation is liberals are getting off by showing off their moral superiority to the bottom dregs of society.  Nazis have no power and won't win anything.
      </p>
      <p>
       Focus on helping the people and forget about all this stuff.  Didn't you guys learn anything from last year?  People are sick of this stuff.  It's time to quit trying to trick people into voting for you and actually do something.

       I'm not sure what positions you're inventing for me, but I'm advocating for winning voters using an economic message.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm just also saying that Trump explicitly fought for and won a lot of voters for white ethnostate reasons-- and chalking up his win to "economic issues!" Doesn't help. Hillary lost both because she didn't appeal to nonvoters on economic grounds AND because Trump won a lot of white voters on identity politics grounds. You're sort of conflating these things in a muddled and unhelpful way.

       my opinion is the left can accomplish a ton by dropping identity politics from the dialog.  show up, have a rally, have a speaker talk about healthcare, education, tax reform, a big infrastructure spending plan that will put people back to work.  Just don't talk about anything that splits people up.  No race, no wage gap, none of that shit.  Go back to old school issues.  You'll win in a landslide.  Instead I predict everyone is going to keep shouting about russia or cops or whatever and you guys will be lucky to narrowly win the next couple elections

       IF you are referring to Boston, that was because the last rally(unite the right) was such a clusterfuck, nobody wanted to see anyone else get run over by a white Supremacist, or worse.

      <p>
       The small turnout from the WS/Nazi's was due people being exposed during the Unite the Right rally. Most wanted to keep their jobs. Don't think that they aren't out there however.

       So literally any political movement left or right is exactly the same because there have been past dictators espousing left and right ideologies in the past? That sounds insane, unhelpful, and ignorantly superficial as a way to view the world.

       Yeah your right actually the Nazis also used collectivisation and the Soviets persued a policy of ethnic domination of europe. In fact now that I think about it one being an internationalist movement and one being a nationalist movement literally makes them the same!

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Socialism in One Country (Russian: Социализм в одной стране Sotsializm v odnoi strane) was a theory put forth by Vladimir Lenin and implemented by Joseph Stalin in 1924, elaborated by Nikolai Bukharin in 1925 and finally adopted by the Soviet Union as state policy.[1] The theory held that given the defeat of all the communist revolutions in Europe in 1917–1921 except Russia's, the Soviet Union should begin to strengthen itself internally.

       Well I think it's pretty obvious why the DNC won't embrace anything further left than their current neoliberalism. They're a bougie party designed to represent the rich, not the working class. Just like the Republicans, they're just more open to welfare and abortion.

        The symptoms of fascist thinking are colored by environment and adapted to immediate circumstances. But always and everywhere they can be identified by their appeal to prejudice and by the desire to play upon the fears and vanities of different groups in order to gain power. It is no coincidence that the growth of modern tyrants has in every case been heralded by the growth of prejudice. It may be shocking to some people in this country to realize that, without meaning to do so, they hold views in common with Hitler when they preach discrimination against other religious, racial or economic groups. Likewise, many people whose patriotism is their proudest boast play Hitler's game by retailing distrust of our Allies and by giving currency to snide suspicions without foundation in fact.

        The American fascists are most easily recognized by their deliberate perversion of truth and fact. Their newspapers and propaganda carefully cultivate every fissure of disunity, every crack in the common front against fascism. They use every opportunity to impugn democracy. They use isolationism as a slogan to conceal their own selfish imperialism. They use every opportunity to impugn democracy. They use isolationism as a slogan to conceal their own selfish imperialism. They cultivate hate and distrust of both Britain and Russia. They claim to be super-patriots, but they would destroy every liberty guaranteed by the Constitution. They demand free enterprise, but are the spokesmen for monopoly and vested interest. Their final objective toward which all their deceit is directed is to capture political power so that, using the power of the state and the power of the market simultaneously, they may keep the common man in eternal subjection.

       Yeah. The right are Fascists too. Let's not cherry pick. This is what Chomsky was talking about when he said there is one Corporate Party with two branches working toward a single goal carefully herding two groups under one umbrella. I'd argue that the deliberate poisoners of public information is far more indicative of the left (right now, historically its the right). Paying lip service to the common welfare is exactly what I would say is representative of the DNC - see Corey Booker's incredible reluctance to stand up to Pharma until he got raked over the coals. The media has been consolidated and the left was embracing the AT&amp;T/Time Warner merger until Sanders was railing against it. Appeals to prejudice are not limited to the right - identity politics is the hallmark of the left. The left had actually been attacking free speech in a number of ways themselves and advocating Censorship of journalists for a number of years in the War on Whistle Blowers. Deliberate perversions of truth and fact, while readily apparent in Trump is also readily apparent in Politifact, USA Today and The New York Times (17 agencies, Clapper's perjury, the fact that the actual damning emails have yet to be discussed in any of those publications, it's illegal to read them anyway). Military force in Syria and Libya is just obfuscating imperialism while claiming to be peace missions. Standing against the First, Second and Fourth Amendments is again a very serious strike against the previous administration. The "Big Government" party using mandated health insurance rather than health
       <em>
        care
       </em>
       is awfully deceitful in their pursuit of power through the market and State.

       DNC clearly has some corporate/capitalist interests, but calling them Fascists is disengenuious, particularly when we have an Administration that is stocked full of Wall Street and Big Oil, Big Pharma and Big Telecom execs trying to erode the media protections, States rights and the rule of law to an extreme degree that has never occurred before in the history of the nation.

       The GOP being fascists has nothing to do with the DNC also being fascists. Obamas war on Whistle Blowers and spying on journalists as well as extrajudiciously executing American citizens abroad for their political ideology and religious views is fascist. It's that simple. Is the GOP more brazen in their steps toward Fascism? Undeniably. But that has more to do with the accountability from the party supporters. The left has historically called out Fascism but with the
       <em>
        obfuscation
       </em>
       of the core tenets of the ideology, the party leadership has been emboldened. The had the audacity to label their movement "The Third Way" (let's not pretend like we don't know what a dog whistle is) - go ahead and do a search for "The Third Way + Mussolini" then again switching Mussolini for Bill Clinton.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also seriously take the time to read The Philosophy of Fascism by Mario Palmieri from 1936. It's actually pretty chilling.

       So the Leftists that you know that supported Bernie Sanders were doing it because of identity politics, rather than his economic policies? If that were the case than why wouldn't the young Leftists that formed Bernie's largest base of support prefer the historic opportunity to elect the first female President?

       He extensively discussed the civil war and how racism as a construct was useful at controlling poor whites.

       The truth of the southern take on the Civil War is that the ending of slavery was palpable but the south deserved adequate compensation for it. Let the nation buy all the slaves out of slavery and integrate them into society in a controlled fashion over time.
       <br/>
       The north decided that they were
       <strong>
        <em>
         morally superior
        </em>
       </strong>
       and that the south would just have to end their evil ways
       <strong>
        <em>
         right now
        </em>
       </strong>
       .

      <p>
       Among other reasons this is why President Lincoln was a tyrant.

       I'm pretty sure if they had just went to the negotiating table and asked for fair compensation for slaves around 1858, they would have had it. But they went with open rebellion instead. You can't do that and then turn around with your tail between your legs and ask in 1865.

       If the North wanted to end slavery then it was on them to act within the law and not violate the 4

       Forcing things to happen on your time-table and without consent of the affected is the essence of all violence.

       Suppose today they decided to make owning an automobile illegal amnd demand you turn them all over without any compenstaion for it. It is preposterous to even suggest that, and for however evil we deem it today, the slaves were property that the people depended upon and had considerable equity invested in.

       I'd gladly do that tomorrow if it was discovered that cars were sapient beings. But since that's not going to happen, the analogy makes no sense. They didn't want to take the property away, they just realized that people aren't property. There's no moral high ground to be had; stop grasping for it.

       Wrong. It was about how the South wanted to continue to exploit free labor and treat people as subhumans in the name of profit. If they wanted a buy out, then why is the ability to own slaves portrayed as divine right, and their mistreatment of the slaves dismissed as attempts to civilized them?
      </p>
      <p>
       Sorry pal that revisionist bullshit won't fly today. The south were a bunch of filthy racists and bigots that were angry that they were being forced to recognize blacks as people and not properly.

       Honest question: why do the rich benefit from people fighting and protesting and generally hating each other?
      </p>
      <p>
       Generally rich people do well in stable societies where people work hard, pay taxes, and are generally healthy and get along.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not like there are a bunch of rich people in countries like Syria and Sudan.

       It's about the degree of the fighting. Far less than 1% of the population is engaged in any kind of open protest and/or fighting, and none of it really does anything to disrupt economic stability. Most people are working hard and paying taxes. However, this protest gets magnified by the media and causes a much larger percentage of people to be mistrustful of their fellow countrymen, and less apt to work together (through electoral politics or community organizing etc.)
      </p>
      <p>
       So I would say it's less about open fighting in the streets, but more about making the working class (which includes the middle class) think they have more differences amongst themselves than they do with the truly rich.

       the blame is on us as citizens for letting this go on for the past 60 years. yet I don't see us ready to upgrade the voting system or overhaul the party choices or even overhaul and upgrade our draconian laws. nope, instead, we let our rights get taken more and more each year. im here waiting on a nice little revolution. a paradigm shift in mentality. let's get people together and use the internet to figure out which laws we need and don't need, establish our own healthcare reform, and a slew of other things. crowd funding a people's party. fuck the govt. let's make something better.

       100% correct. However, as I've previously stated here and elsewhere, we need to use this plan of division against them. It at least seems on the surface that the left is vastly numerically superior in this fight. The left has shown they aren't afraid of protest, civil disobedience, even violence from time to time. That's the kind of energy we need. Now, the moderates don't really have a horse in the race (yet,) but we should give them one.
      </p>
      <p>
       Guide that anger and energy towards enemies that we all have, and though we may not see the far right follow, we will see moderates start to gravitate toward these causes and goals. If we can move attention towards our common enemies by even an inch, we have enough momentum to start occupation style protests and ensure their sights are on the proper targets.
      </p>
      <p>
       The state is making this easy. We just need to exploit their mistakes and weaknesses.

       Yes, let's yell at the people knocking down statues specifically put up by the KKK to intimidate minorities because they are feeding just as much into the division and hatred as literal Nazis and white supremacists who shout such slogans as "Jews will not replace us" and kill people.

       The main point people seem to want to push now is Both Parties Are Equally Horrible! But there is one party clearly in power now clearly doing damage. Yes maybe deep down behind the scenes the Rothschilds or whoever the fuck is REALLY pulling the strings, but once all that power gets translated down to my everyday life, there's still one party advocating for universal healthcare, and the other party bankrupting the Secret Service to protect private real estate. It's obvious that dems and the repubs aren't SO the same that their effect on my life is identical regardless of who's in power.

       America is already weak. And it doesn't have anything to do with far anything. It has to do with the marxist indoctrination in schools, business (see google), and general social life. It is feminism. It is victim politics and oppression olympics. It's treating kids softly. It's the kindergarten classroom rendering of western society at large. It's the food and dietary habits. It's the volume of information, much of which is bullshit, but reality is so bizarre it's hard to separate fact, fiction and satire.
      </p>
      <p>
       Everything is awfully confusing and people will say, "well, look at the "real" problems; central banking, prison industrial complex, military industrial complex, political corruption, lobbying, reproductive rights, civic rights, sexism, racism, bigotry, the federal reserve, the CFR, Bilderbergers, Agenda 21, vaccines, GMO, Monsanto, gun control, Google, Microsoft, Bill Gates, George Soros, Warren Buffet,  North Korea, China, the Jews, the Illuminati, pedophilia, the Clintons, Donald Trump, Jeff Sessions, Obama, Common Core, our poor infrastructure[...]." but I could go down this list ad nauseam but it doesn't matter.
      </p>
      <p>
       It doesn't matter because all of these things are problems but not THE problem. The problem is decadence and the loss of will to accept the responsibility to maintain the great thing. Adulthood is essentially eradicated in the west and has been deferred to "authority." People are too weak and too dumb to reason, and too cowardly to embrace the freedom of autonomy.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, what we have for everyone is austerity, which will be good because then nobody will have more than me or things I do not have. And that's how you make children of entire cultures.

       Look into Foundations of Geopolitics. Deepening division in the US is a major Russian geopolitical objective, since they have long realized that they cannot compete on any economic, military or cultural dimension. Instead it K's far more effective to accelerate the divide between Europe and US and within the US. And Trump was a perfect vehicle for exactly that.

       So this is actually pretty simple. There are labor groups, all sorts of associations, and political groups. Removing lobbyists brings opinion back down to the actual people that care about issues. If you take lobbyists out of the equation then the leaders of these groups would inform their people to contact their representatives with their opinion. It would require Americans to be more involved, but it would absolutely allow our voices to be heard.

       This is one of those topics that I'm really torn on. On the one hand, it makes sense that whoever the most people vote for should win. On the other hand, rural citizens like myself already feel pretty overlooked and ignored. If you make it so candidates only need to appeal to large urban centers in order to win, then people like me will be at best completely forgotten about or at worst trampled on and taken advantage of.

       I know, that's why I'm torn. I feel like there has to be an Option 3 that is a better balance than just electoral college vs. no electoral college. Don't ask me what is is though, because I have no idea.

       Right, but that's the senate not the presidency. Should we just have one broken system that favors small states serve as a counter to another broken system that favors large states? Or should we try to fix both broken systems?

       That's the purpose of a bicameral legislature - one chamber based on population, another on sovereignty.
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem is that there's three co-equal branches of the government, and each branch is currently broken in it's own special way. They all need to be fixed. Fixing one branch at a time is definitely better than doing nothing.

       No, you feel overlooked, and its wrong of you to claim your feeling is a statement of fact. Furthermore, your feeling is factually incorrect, as voters from less populace states already have more of a say per vote than voters from more populous states.

       Like the other person who responded to me, you are talking about representatives while I'm talking about the presidency. And I even said the electoral college gives too much power to small states while removing the electoral college gives too little power to small states. There must be some other system that would have a better balance between the big population centers and the rural states.

       The amount of power each citizen has in  presidential elections is directly tied to the number of representatives. States with few people have more representatives per person, and also more power in presidential elections per person. A person in an underpopulated state has no good reason to feel overlooked no matter whether youre talking about presidential elections or about representatives.
      </p>
      <p>
       You say removing the electoral college gives too little power to people in small states, but why is an equal amount of power as everyone else too little? Why, fundamentally, do they deserve more than everyone else?

       I said it gives too little power to the less populated states because their needs could be completely ignored by the federal government without any significant impact to the politicians. If Chicago, NYC, and Los Angeles alone could pick the president every four years, the candidates wouldn't even bother campaigning anywhere else. All policies would revolve around whatever the large urban centers tend to agree with most since they are the only voting groups that would matter.

       But how is an amount of power proportionate to population size too little power? Those cities worked hard to build the inferstructure to support the population levels they have, and they deserve proportional power.

       If you want to get rid of the electoral college then you'll need to be open to the concept of voter ID. Even with the EC the idea of accurate voting is vital especially when considering the number of illegal immigrants who might be tempted to vote. 10 million+ is not a number to scoff at and even if only a percentage of them vote it disrupts the nature of an election.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for feelings, remember that they are inconsequential so the feelings of illegal immigrants is irrelevant.
      </p>
      <p>
       But ultimately I don't expect to see the EC being removed and if you feel it's unfair to a larger city then consider moving where you'll feel more special. Larger cities are more expensive so these small cities should be advantageous no?

       And if you want us to be open to the concept of voter ID, you need to be open to the concepts of as elections as a national holiday, held on weekends, with automatic vote registration all provided at low cost. We're not inherently opposed to the idea, but we are greatly concerned about what is perceived to be an assault on the rights of the American people.

       Flip that on it's side- you're saying that rural people should get
       <em>
        more

       say than people who don't live in rural areas, because you're afraid if things change they will be taken advantage of in a more fair system.

       My whole family is from rural areas, and I'm in an urban area so I have this discussion every single time there is a gathering and not one single sensible argument is made... it all boils down to "I would get less of a say than I do now, I don't care if it is more fair or not."

       No, I agree with you. It doesn't seem fair to give more power to rural people, but I still want some way to make sure their needs and interests are fairly addressed. I'm worried that if you just use the popular vote, then presidential candidates only ever need to worry about a few major urban areas. They could solely focus on topics that matter to the big cities while ignoring the flyover states completely and still win the election. As it is now, Obama only visited my state once in his entire eight years as president, and that was during his final month in office. They don't care about us as it is, and it seems like that would be even worse if  our votes were just a drop in the bucket compared to the big cities.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's how I see it anyway, but maybe my fears aren't justified. I'll admit our current system definitely isn't the best way of running things.

       Actually, abolishing the EC would remove states from the equation altogether.  It wouldn't matter which state most of the population lives in; it would just matter what the entire U.S. population wants.

        abolishing the electoral college

       Sounds like a terrible idea... a good way to expand the federal government and keep the masses at each others throats. Think about straight majority rule: the popular vote along would leave a large portion of the country disenfranchised and pit them at the majority, seeing the majority as the cause for the problem rather than the system itself.
      </p>
      <p>
       IMO the ever expanding federal government is the cause of a lot of our problems. It supports a military industrial complex of world conquest proportions, makes broad sweeping taxes, laws &amp; legislation that is not tailored to states and local governments, and brings in so much cronyism that makes people on all sides feel disenfranchised and demoralized.

       A national popular vote works fine in the many countries that use it. Regulatory capture and corporate roll backs of the federal government are the real problem.

       I mean I get the idea of them against the majority and creating that tension, but if the majority of the country says they want something or want to do something then why should be allow the minority to change that.

       I don't think you'll be able to abolish the electoral college anytime soon, smaller states would never give up that power. Gerrymandering however definitely needs to go. All sides have abused that for far too  long.

       I'm a hippy liberal just lurking and I agree with this except for term limits. We have to be smarter and NOT vote in the politicians that screw us. Term limits hurt the really good congressman. I'd like to add voting as a national holiday. Only essential business open and EVERY School is a polling place open for 24 hours. Make it as easy as possible so ALL Americans have a say

       Well I see your point but it's really the right thing to do. MAYBE if education was better funded and not looked down upon by many we could move this country in the right direction. I know we all disagree on many things but I think we all agree we just want to live our life safe and peacefully without the govt fucking us in the ass weekly.

       A free press. Breaking up the big media conglomerates, and ensuring net neutrality is legally enshrined will go a long way to helping to create an informed and politically engaged public. Once the public knows how much they're being screwed by the big banks, corporate conglomerates, multinationals, insurance companies, educational underfunding, and their own government in a hundred different ways, then they will feel compelled to do something about it.

       So basically we need a revolution. I think the problem is that the general population doesn't understand who is to blame, and who we should be fighting against. I know who I think that is, but I feel that 99% of the rest of the population might not agree with me. Maybe if there was less propaganda we would all come to the same conclusion.

       I agree. Personally, I think we should all direct our anger at the global banking cartel. The problem is that the politicians we vote for cant or wont help us get rid of that parasite, it is too powerful and ubiquitous. I'm not sure what it would take other than getting an incredibly brave leader to call out the problem intelligently and charismatically and hope he doesn't get assassinated.

       Such horseshit.
       <br/>
       Our education system is massively overfunded and it results in graft.
       <br/>
       If you want to get serious about education reform the first thing you would do is have all-year long pre-school and kindergartner and you would break it into three-trimesters or four-quarters of more similarly aged and capable kids. Everything else is useless bullshit in comparison to how important this change is.

       I actually think both of those would be great. I've been thinking for a while of the benefits of gender-split schools. The age with which it ends is debatable but I think it has a lot of merit.
      </p>
      <p>
       I still think the kids need social interaction with the opposite sex, but I don't think it helps in the school setting.

       The year-long Pre-K/K would be excellent as well and a huge help for many parents I would imagine.

       What how? Just because Trump's spent less than Clinton doesn't mean CU is nullified. It's still legal for anyone to take advantage of not to mention it's not limited to only presidential races. Also I have a bridge to sell you if you honestly think Trumps campaign is not utilizing CU as much as possible.

       The propaganda around the Islamic threat is more there to scare you into giving away your privacy, your freedoms, and money away to big daddy government promising to keep you safe.

       The more blatant xenophobia is against low-wage workers of colors coming into the country. Your white authorities want you to look down on a poor sap wanting to pick oranges to feed his family, while your white authorities siphon off TRILLIONS to their corporate buddies. They tell you the starving brown dude is the problem, so that you don't disturb their racket at the top.

       I would've agreed with you fully until Charlottesville. The inability to fully make a clean break from Nazis was, to me, breathtaking. Obviously it's not materially worse than what other presidents have done, but it puts him down a few rungs for me, to say the least.

       The main point is that it immediately identifies the actual source of whatever you're presenting. Secondly, it gives you the opportunity to see if anything was "lost in summary" from the source to being condensed for Wikipedia. Not everything on Wikipedia is referenced as properly as their standards dictate if at all.

       Yet Wikipedia has a laundry list of guarding mechanisms to deal with editorial inadequacies by adding template warnings. In addition, at Wikipedia, the talk page provides a level of transparency about the editing process no reference listed by Wikipedia in and of itself provides. Lastly, Wikipedia provides the luxury of hosting
       <em>
        vetted synthesis
       </em>
       by a large team of collaborating editors bound by an elaborate system of rules designed to prevent various biases and errors. So, rather than one source, you get to see the end product of synthesizing a large number of reliable mainstream sources, further minimizing the chance of error. This chance of error can be enlarged by relying on a single source.
      </p>
      <p>
       And.. if you see something which you deem out of whack, provided you can back it up  epistemologically and/or historiographically, you can
       <em>
        actually do something about it
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Casting out Wikipedia as inappropriate to cite on Reddit strikes me as just another extension of the alt-right's war on the media: Wikipedia has long been accused of having a liberal bias, by, for example, climate deniers. Amplifying and exaggerating Wikipedia's alleged flaws is just another way of shutting out references which can quickly resolve a factual dispute. It can be very impractical, too, because if, for example, somebody wanted to know about a creationism-related subject such as
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irreducible_complexity">
        irreducible complexity
       </a>
       , what could replace, using a single sources, the comprensive article available on Wikipedia citing many reliable sources?
      </p>
      <p>
       I sense an agenda behind delegitimizing Wikipedia as a source suitable for citation on Reddit. I understand the objections w.r.t. a post-doctoral thesis, or a term paper, but on Reddit? No, I don't understand it, and I find this subtle "you can't cite Wikipedia" stuff reminiscent of source exclusion for purposes of rhetorical obfuscation. After all, when debating a creationist, I now have to work ten times as hard finding and basically rewriting the entire Wikipedia page, with references, to satisfy the requirements of the creationist asking me for a reference.

       If Wiki is so good, why isn't it allowed as a reference in academia? I'm not saying reddit should be held to the same standards, but it does dampen your entire first two paragraphs that the people in the field of facts and reliability do not look kindly on Wikipedia.

       Because academic authors are supposed to be authors or
       <em>
        producers
       </em>
       rather than
       <em>
        consumers
       </em>
       of fact. That's the core reason it's not allowed. Citing Wikipedia outsources the responsibility of gathering evidence in a scholarly manner when academia expects orginal research.
      </p>
      <p>
       Scientific papers are regarded as standing "above" Wikipedia, so citing Wikipedia inverts that hierarchy. Wikipedia cites academia, not the other way around: otherwise, you could get a circular reference: Academia cites Wikipedia, then later Wikipedia cites Academia citing Wikipedia.

      <p>
       Your assertion here is false, as explained above: they don't necessarily look unkindly on Wikipedia: they just feel that there is a hierarchy where Wikipedia should cite Academia and not the other way around.
      </p>
      <p>
       In 2005, the reputable science journal Nature did a reliability study on Wikipedia and concluded Encylopedia Brittanica and Wikipedia were basically on an even keel.

       I covered that also: there is a distinct advantage to be able to cite a crowdsourced, vetted work which is a
       <em>
        synthesis of reliable sources
       </em>
       rather than a single reliable source.
      </p>
      <p>
       The former is richer in information, more versatile and more reliable.

       My cousin did this and I gave him a ton of examples. He the said "well you can't really tell if anything is true anymore". It's incredibly frustrating that the only proof they're willing to accept is stuff that agrees with them.

       When did I complain about his policy? He's an embarrassing moron who has no idea what the fuck he's doing. He's divided this country even more than it was. He's a pathological liar who lies about easily verifiable shit. But, if we have to get down to policy (he hasn't passed a single piece of major legislation) then the majority of shit he's rolled back JUST because Obama enacted it is worth getting pissed off about. People (morons) hear deregulation and automatically assume it's a positive thing when really he's setting us the fuck back.

       Opium and rare minerals...I mean terrorism! We went there with the publicized intention of dealing with Al Qaeda, Taliban, and their allies. We entered with the public idea that there were training facilities there.
      </p>
      <p>
       Assuming actual terrorist issues exist, getting rid of terrorists is like preparing a plot of land for farming. You remove all the weeds, but if you don't plant something there, and minimally maintain it, it just gets overrun with weeds again. They talk about a power "vacuum" if all the troops leave.

       The wall is built. ISIS is being destroyed, no nation building. There already have been mass deportations. He is able to use tariffs to leverage deals, like the coal deal with China cutting off North Korean coal sales.

       That is just factually incorrect, to the point of being laughable.
      </p>
      <p>
       The ACA, or Affordable Care Act, was a law passed by Congress. And signing a Treaty has nothing to do with appropriating funds. It's just a signature. And that act is a million miles away from funding a domestic infrastructure project, so it's not comparable.

       Not initially they were not. The ACA originally used executive orders to start the program, then Congress just voted to support the executive orders. One reason why Republicans were warning their colleges across the isle to avoid abusing executive orders, because later they would be crying for the rule of law.

       Trump was able to remove major regulations within the ACA because they were executive orders. Same with the Paris Treaty. Obama gambled that another President would continue passing his executive orders instead of revoking.

       Let me dumb it down for you. Just because you call a few fence companies for an estimate on how much it would cost to put some chain-link between me and my neighbor doesn't mean you have a fence yet. Once the bids are in, you've got to convince your wife to sign the cheque.

       Bush Jr, Clinton, Reagan, Truman, Nixon, Carter, Roosevelt and many more presidents used more executive orders than Obama. In less than a year, Trump has issued around 1/5 of the amount of executive orders as Obama in 2 terms. Forget watching links, read the Department of State's official documentation. Roosevelt issued over 3000 including payment into new programs such as Welfare.

       Funny part about Roosevelt executive orders is when he died Congress approved of his controversial programs and expanded on them later. Obama was able to fund his programs almost immediately.

       What's the correlation? That you consider Obama's programs controversial? I don't even think Congress has to approve executive orders which kind of makes that argument pointless.

       Congress has to approve funding for these programs. The programs can exist but without major funding increases.

       Still waiting for the correlation if it isn't blind hatred for Obama. That doesn't even make sense to me considering Obama was, objectively, the best president we've had in over a 2 decades.

       Global warming is made up hype to sell more products, which ironically furthers global pollution and increases climate change.
      </p>
      <p>
       For reference, climate change is defined as the natural changes of global temperatures (livable up and down differences). Global warming is defined as the Doomsday theory where temperature raises too high for life to survive.

       Solar, wind and hydro power are the past and the future. Gas/petroleum and coal powered energy were the long con and absolutely altering our environment. It's not just about warming. Its about extreme weather changes, about salinity of the oceans, about chemicals in the groundwater, about geomagnetic changes to the earth and how that effects all wildlife, erosion. You are spouting propaganda. Go look at your local stream and tell me humans are not making huge, lasting changes to the environment.

       I can't decide that if Trump was a candidate of antiestablishment legitimately or if he was a chosen antiestablishment candidate by the deep state elitist thugs. If legitimate he's obviously been beaten into a corner and is doing what he is being told by those that are truly in power. If a chosen candidate his ineptitude to effectuate change maybe effective enough for people to accept our government as is. I mean if a rich motivated successful business man can't negotiate Washington, why would we send anyone else there besides the establishment?  Either way, it's a clear message of who is running the show. It's not the American people or their elected officials.

       Lets also admit that we could all have voted for Jill Stein and been no worse off at all.     Paralysis would have been assured with Jill,  but how could that have been worse.   And the only real issue is getting the elite off our backs,  which mean the first thing that needs to be done is that Citizen's United and all the bribery by money in politics needs to fucking end.    Otherwise,  the pedophilia,  racial division mongering,  identity politics are all going to be used just to fuck with us,  to keep the elites in power.
      </p>
      <p>
       Unfortunately,  we are still totally suggestible,  the people are still going to be endlessly played,  our lives fucked,  even sacrificed, as mercenaries,  slaves,  and pawns of the elite,  because we can't get our shit together and see the obvious,  we are still going to vote the two corrupt parties of liars into office,  we are still going to let them be owned by the corporations and the elite.    We are still going to complain about Trump,  Hillary and the rest who should all be in fucking prison.

       Which again blows me away, because I voted against BOTH of them by voting 3rd party. It seems so logically obvious. But I guess people have this need to be on a "winning team" and think voting 3rd party (voting for what they actually want) is "throwing their vote away", which it kind of is because of the 2-party voting system we have. It's so frustrating

       Yeah,  the two turds,  I called them.   But the Libertarian ticket and the Green ticket had a lot of problems too,  as third parties often do,  for example,  did you see the VP pick on the Green Party side?    I mean I voted for Jill,  but damn that VP pick was a joke.    You remember when the league of women voters used to handle the presidential debates and would include third parties?   That was done away with which didn't help,   but man,  in all my life of over 6 decades,  I have never seen such corruption as I saw in these elections.    People were either terrified of Trump or terrified of Hillary.    I was terrified of both.    But people were voting against the other side with what they thought was the best shot they had,  so we got the worst of the worst by default.

       I am at the point where I really think that the weight of all the genocidal crimes the US has committed is going to be impossible to dodge.   Vietnam was bad enough,   but now the US has crossed a line even more despicable and people blot out the horrific hell that has been wrought.    That hell is going to be lived out here next,  sorry to say,  one way or the other.   Its already started,  and you can tell partly by the opioid, alcohol,  and anti depression meds that are being consumed,  and also the raising of children is getting more problematic than before.   And also the suicides among vets.   Lots of signs that hell is descending in our midst,  lots of cultural clues that it started a while back,  and the denial has been intense.

       Let me give you a lesson in Civics 101:  Congress passes laws,  Congress amends the constitution.    If Congress is not responsive to the will of the people,   and its not,  its partly because the people have been successfully fragmented.    If every American is tired of bribery of Congress,  and votes in a new Congress,  that would be better than expecting the Supreme Court to bail us out.

       In a way yes,  but it was the MSM that created Trump,   gave him endless free coverage because it was a spectacle at that time and it was bringing ratings.    During the same time the MSM gave almost zero to Jill and Bernie.      The MSM was having a blast setting up Trump against Jeb and the others and having Trump win.    The MSM only was willing to stab Hillary when covering the Comey FBI thing could not be contained and they pretty much
       <em>
        had
       </em>
       to jump in.    But before that they let Lynch collude with Bill Clinton with no coverage.    Your interpretation worked under Ron Paul but not under Trump.

       The upshot is that, like Obama, he never really stood a chance  against the Deep State. It's too entrenched and powerful.
      </p>
      <p>
       Think about it: the last two presidents were elected promising massive, sweeping changes to National Security policy, and nothing so far has changed in any material way. Obama wanted out of Afghanistan, but the Deep State only gave him two choices: send more troops, or sent
       <em>
        a lot
       </em>
       more troops. And now Trump, having campaigned on a platform of bringing troops  back, is doing just as his predecessor did and sending more goddamn troops.

       This is bullshit, youre just making excuses. Trump could be doing so much more than he is. He has no problem picking fights until matters. Maybe Obama feel short in many regards but at least he didnt work directly with these groups. Trump is actually SUPPORTING almost all of these groups.

       The only excuse I'm making is that US presidents do not have any real control over national security policy. Doesn't matter who they are. If my bro Bernie had been elected, I bet he'd be launching Tomahawks and sending troops just like Trump is. Hillary wouldn't have been much different (although I think she might have been more aggressive in Syria).

       This is nonsense. Trump certainly could have held his positions on international policy - he chose not to. You're giving him a pass. He decided to reject the advice of those who got him elected, and accept the advice of those who he hired post-election.

       Obama was elected on promises to exit Afghanistan, close Guantanamo, and end indefinite detention. I believe he was right to want all of those things on moral grounds, and as someone who studied and taught constitutional law, they likely reflected some of his closely held values. Yet he didn't do any of those things. Why not? Not because he was lazy, and most definitely not because he didn't care--it was because he was literally powerless to achieve these goals. Commander in Chief, President of the USA, Leader of the Free World, most powerful person on the planet, yet somehow he just couldn't make it happen. Who the fuck do you think he was answering to?

       Your bias is showing. Barack Obama is a Deep State/CIA-crafted puppet, an unrepentant war criminal and one of the globalists' most effective allies in recent history.  He was almost a perfect Manchurian Candidate for their goals, due to him being such a personable guy and likable figure with a cult of personality.  Trump has already done many things to screw over the prevailing order that Obama
       <em>
        never
       </em>
       would have done on his best day, and has shown considerable restraint when it comes to using the military in comparison to at least the last few Presidents.  It's still unclear where Trump's loyalties truly lie, but he's clearly not stumping for ISIS or Al-Qaeda, and definitely loves his country.  To say that Obama didn't directly work with the enemies of the United States -
       <em>
        GLOBALISTS DINGDINGDING
       </em>
       - shows that you really have no idea, or don't understand the true problems.

       You don't need to be right or left to understand that there is a shadow government that has been running things behind the scenes for a very long time.  There is ample evidence that Barack Obama is a creation of the intelligence agencies and this has been commented on by not only right-wingers but plenty of actual liberals as well.  Notice I said
       <em>
        actual
       </em>
       liberals, not the neoliberal scum that have co-opted the left lately.

       Dude, why don't you actually address the point he's making? Being president doesn't just mean you can do whatever you want, and a lot of presidents aren't really aware of what they're getting themselves into until they're there.

       Honestly I'm not for making people take a test to vote. But I'm glad we don't let children vote. With replies like this all you do is show us you are some edgy teenager who can't even vote yet alone drive himself anywhere.

       You're kidding, right? Name another politician that has a chance of changing anything significant in this country over the next three years. Name another politician who could be elected president in 2020 that I should be remotely excited about.

       I can understand if you just don't like Trump or his ideas, but it should be obvious why people feel like he is the only chance we have at the moment.

       Donald Trump is not fueling cultural division whatsoever.

       The left, who hate him with a vengeance, are doing that on a daily basis and blaming Trump for their own actions.

       Yeah, even as far back as the Civil War. Or maybe even as far back as the American Revolution? Or even maybe before that?

      <p>
       Not sure what your point is here.
      </p>
      <p>
       My point still stands, trump has been dividing this country since day1, his campaign was fueled on divisive rhetoric, so was Hillary's.

       There is one thing very significant about Trump:
      </p>
      <p>
       He was not suppose to win. This was obvious to everyone on the planet the night it happened.
      </p>
      <p>
       He may very well now be a bitch of the deep state, like all presidents, but he was not suppose to even be there.

      <p>
       The fact that he's there is very significant and shows the divide between the factions that make up this cabal of evil.

       Take a step back and think about this one for a minute.  The answer..  The same people... The same TPTB that has put the last handful of presidents in power.. The same TPTB that tell their mouthpiece newspapers and media outlets to hate on Trump.. It's all part of the show... he's the protagonist.. They need someone to play dumb, rule up the TV pundits, who fire up the disenfranchised of all races protesting each other, causing division amongst the middle poor and working classes.. In addition to the division, it also helps shift the Overton window on free speech and acceptable opinions.. The goal is still the same, corporations run this country and its profits over people, coupled with the erosion of our freedoms and first amedment rights...

       An organization with that amount of power wouldn't need to create such a narrative in the first place. If they convinced Trump to run specifically for the media in turn to paint him as an adversary, they have already won the game.

       But losing sight of the real consequences of things is a requirement for most conspiracy theories.

       I agree with you. Nobody was expecting it, and honestly, I don't think TPTB were either.
      </p>
      <p>
       I never wanted him to be president, but I do believe that he doesn't want to be doing a lot of the things the deep state is coercing him into doing. He's in a tricky situation, just like a lot of presidents before him.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for who got him in power, it could've been the Alliance, I definitely entertain that idea. I also entertain a few other ones, but something tells me they wouldn't be that well received in this subreddit. At least not anymore. But I do think you're onto something.

       He gamed social media using highly experienced experts from the advertising world, something Hillary was very bad at and most importantly it happened in the context of a new generation of voters.
      </p>
      <p>
       He also rallied all over the place, pulling a lot of baby boomers and vets to his side while Hillary hid behind the curtains, or gave awkward and at times unpopular speeches &amp; messaging.
      </p>
      <p>
       I wasn't surprised. I'm not saying I cared for either candidate but I could feel the movement happening on the Internet after the speeches he was giving. Totally agree that TPTB didn't see it coming, but the youth and rural areas of America were spreading it like wildfire.

       Take a step back and think about this one for a minute. The answer.. The same people... The same TPTB that has put the last handful of presidents in power.. The same TPTB that tell their mouthpiece newspapers and media outlets to hate on Trump.. It's all part of the show... he's the protagonist.. They need someone to play dumb, rule up the TV pundits, who fire up the disenfranchised of all races protesting each other, causing division amongst the middle poor and working classes.. In addition to the division, it also helps shift the Overton window on free speech and acceptable opinions.. The goal is still the same, corporations run this country and its profits over people, coupled with the erosion of our freedoms and first amedment rights...

       Tragedy is quite a hyperbolic assumption to make. I think he's saying less that "the two can't be the same," and I think he's merely pointing out "what's the conspiracy here in the first place?"
      </p>
      <p>
       Truth and conspiracy can also be separate. That's the claim he made. You didn't counter it, you just jumped to an assumption he may or may not have implied.

       Because conspiracy is defined as "a secret plan by a group to do something unlawful or harmful", I would conjecture that Trump &amp; Co conspired to attain and exploit the position of POTUS by building an image designed to influence disenfranchised Americans (
       <a href="/r/TrumpCriticizesTrump">

       <a href="/u/haveyouseenmymarble">

       is right: if such conjecture were true, it still fits the definition of conspiracy, they are not mutually exclusive terms.

       Trump is right. We get out of the middle East now and Isis can take over. Obama and Bush created this mess, trump is waiting to be able to fix it. My thinking is he'll want Isis under control first, then he can pull out, hopefully also investigate how Obama created Isis. Give the man his term and wait and see how he uses it instead of opposing someone who has only been in office for 6 months

       Trump made it clear that he was as conventional as they come when he drained the swamp by placing the most corporate backed individuals to the heads of big departments. Anyone who thought Trump would be able to run our country well is nothing short of a moron. It's amazing that people think that barely being able to manage a business effectively translates into being able to work in politics. Further more Trump is just stealing all of our tax dollars to take vacations EVERY weekend which he puts in his own pocket by using his hotels to house the secret service and support staff. This should infuriate you. He's already blown through his 4 year budget in about 6 months. That thin skinned piece of shit said he wouldn't even take vacations. (I think any president deserves vacations, Trump just treats our tax dollars like a limitless resource, and so far has put none of them to effective use.)

       The Secret Service has exceeded it's
       <em>
        annual
       </em>
       budget, which afaik is not a 4 year plan. It's still way too early to be exceeded budget though. You can thank him for traveling to Trump properties, after raising prices once he became president.
      </p>
      <p>
       The other issue is that there are 42 people related to Trump that get secret service protection, which is alot relative to other presidents. On top of that, Trump's family members take numerous individual vacations and business trips, so it all adds up.

       There are numerous articles being written right now, it's a recent issue. Search online and you should be able to find plenty of other sources.

       As much as I hate to argue with the guy who is the one actually setting up the budget and is much more of an expert than I am, I have to be a little skeptical that he is just afraid to criticize the administration in the public light.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean the guy has more family members under secret service protection, takes more vacations, and more expensive vacations compared to the last presiden. I find it hard to believe that this administration costs just as much as as the last one.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also I don't remember the SS asking for more money under Obama, that would have been major conservative fuel. And they already ripped into him plenty for taking vacations

       That's certainly possible. It should be noted that there's actually been a $100 Billion reduction in the budget deficit since the current administration took office. Where that money came from exactly? Idk. But I don't think it's all bad.

       USA Today printed his original comments.

      <p>
       And just a cursory glance at the known facts shows that it's bullshit: the USSS budget is the same as it was last year, but it has already run out faster than it did last year.  And last year, that budget not only covered the sitting President and his family, but it
       <em>
        also
       </em>
       covered all of the half dozen or so candidates and their families, who were already traveling all over the country constantly to campaign.  So basically, they're now covering
       <em>
        far
       </em>
       fewer people, ran out of money faster, and the big difference is Trump now vacations to his ritzy private resorts every weekend and charges the taxpayers for it.  Hmmm...

       I may have misinterpreted the budget timeframe- I apologize for that, either way though, he's still already blown through the budget, a lot of which goes straight into his pockets because of where he chooses to stay, he also has a wife that doesn't even want to live with him and she requires a separate detail who lives in a Trump residence in which the secret service also pays into trumps pocket by staying there.

       And to anyone who didn't vote for him this was OBVIOUS. He is a classic narcissist. Who finds an excuse or person to blame for any and all of his own shortcomings. It's never his fault, and he's never wrong. His own ego can't handle that. At their core, narcissists are very insecure. Their lashing out is a defense mechanism.

       Yes, than Trump. He was a wildcard, much more so than Hillary. Hillary has a track record of being an enemy to the people. Trump however was a shot in the dark. I'd rather gamble $1000 than outright choose to lose $1000.

       So I have a legitimate question, I promise I'm not patronizing or being condescending. Does policy matter at all to You? So I ask because I didn't vote for the politician this last go around. When I vote I look for the bigger picture regardless of the letter following the name. Trump had no policy for virtually anything and if he did have a plan there would rapidly be major changes that made his first plan null and void. As far as policy goes where are your concerns? In my case it was education, environment, 2A freedoms, and policy to bridge the wealth gap. I say this as a generalization but most Trump voters I know are completely ignorant of policy and policies are the cogs which move this nation forward in one way or another. Trumps only consistent policy was his wall. Literally, which isn't happening. So again my question is, when you vote, does policy matter? I only ask because for me policy is all that matters.

       Policy matters, yes. Ironically the few policies he had we're what I agreed with. All of Hillary's, I disagreed with. Policy is not that big for me, but if your political history is filled with nothing but negatives and you've don't virtually nothing for the people you were supposed to have served for what seems like ages, then there's nothing you can say to sway me to your side. I wanted so so so badly for Marco Rubio to take the cake for Republicans and Jim Webb for Democrats because those are both people I feel the nation could have benefitted from. I grew up in Virginia and Jim Webb did great things on both sides of the political coin.

I will say this though, at least democrats usually have a plan for the tax revenue and many times programs that help people are enacted- see Obama care. I'm not a fan of the ACA but it helped millions of Americans. Trumps ideas are: a wall- which won't do shit to keep people out (crazy devices are used for this sort of thing- they are called ladders I think they are pretty new on the market) his foreign policy involves keeping troops in Afghanistan (a war we can't win) at least Obama pulled out of Iraq. Yes that created Isis but this is really bushes fault. At least dems usually have a plan.

       Donald is a big ass mistake but I don't  feel like he's the one pushing cultural division or identity politics. That's a lefty thing. Conservatives are tired of talking about it.

       Who is they? Black people commit more crime than white people, ecspecially violent crime. I'm sorry that offends you. Second, more unarmed white people are killed every year by police than black. I'm sure this fact also offends you. Third, what rights have been taken away from gay people and women? None.

       "Black people commit more crime than white people, ecspecially violent crime." They receive harsher sentences than white people and are direct victims of the war on drugs. "more unarmed white people are killed every year by police than black" Adjust for population. "what rights have been taken away from gay people and women? None." Conservatives constantly attack abortion and  contraceptive rights, they also haven't swallowed the fact that gay people can get married, there's also Trump tweeting that trangender people should be banned from the military. The comment I was replying to said "Conservatives don't want to talk about identity politics anymore" which is a crock of shit.

       You can want to adjust for population? Go adjust black crime for population and get back to me. I haven't heard Trump really say shit about gay Mariah or abortion. I do remember both Hillary and Obama saying that marriage should be between a man and a women. The issues of gay marriage and abortion have actually hardly been touched on since Trump took office.

       Actually, his "ban" was the exact same "ban" that Obama put in place a few years back.

       Obama's travel ban was a slowdown(not shutdown)  of refugee applications from one country(Iraq) after a specific plot was found.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump's travel ban is a ban of all refugee applications and visas(different from refugee applications)(unless they have a relationship with the US I.e have a family member) from 6 different countries not reacting on any specific Intel, but some vague they might attack it

       I would wait until the end of the year. Many of his motions are hard to understand now but they will all make sense in a few more months. This 14D chess stuff gets confusing.

       I flip flopped on Trump but now I'm back on the Trump train regardless of appearances. It's hard to see through the 4D chess but there is a good story behind it all and I am pretty certain we will all see it by end of year max.

       I give him credit for being an independent thinker and speaker ... at least at first. Call me a conspiracy theorist nut job, but I would guess he now better understands the power and evil that surrounds him, and doesn't feel like getting ushered into Dealey Plaza in an open limo any time soon.

       Did you actually watch his speech?  That's pretty much the opposite of the larger goal he had in mind, which is to
       <em>
        lessen
       </em>
       American involvement around the world and let these countries handle their own affairs.  Looking at the subtext of what he was talking about with Pakistan, Afghanistan, India, etc., you can make an argument that US global alliances are radically shifting and Trump may very well be turning on the Israelis and Saudis that have been running the blackmail-bribery game in our government/Congress forever.  Many on the inside tip have stated already that Trump has been isolated from the Zionist factions in his cabinet, Kushner has been effectively neutralized as an Israeli shill, Bannon was shipped out because he's more useful running Breitbart to help Trump, and that the military is de-facto running the country right now because their goals align with Trump's and his backers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whether or not Trump truly is anti-establishment and failing or is just going along with the act, he's done a better job of exposing the system and the fuckery than anyone, at least give him that.  If he wasn't smart enough to cover his ass and have tons of supporters and private security protecting him, he would have been dead already.

       No he hasn't and yes people watched the speech he is sending in 5,000 more troops into a place he promised to get the troops out of right away. Stop defending him at every single thing he does. That's pathetic. I don't even do that with the people I vote for. How does it truly make you feel that trump went back on another promise of his?

       I'm NOT defending everything he does, I'm nowhere near the absolutist that you and yours are.  Stop being a mouth-breathing sports fan with politics that only sees things one way or another, and understand that you live in a gray world and there's a lot of complexities.

       No shit. I no there are lots of complexities. Hence why it's so maddening. Trump has for years bitched at Obama acting like he could do better. Trump now has that opportunity and all the sudden who thought health care could have been so complicated. Who thought bring troops home could have been so complicated.

       I am not frothing over partisanship. I'm frothing because one side is so full of numb nuts they voted this man in believing all the shit he said was so easy. Please go to TD and tell them things are complex. I know they are. But the president of the US doesn't seem to know that nor does his supporters.

       Calling Trump a CEO is cute, but wholly off base. CEO's are accountable to a board of directors and actually have to LEAD or else be swiftly removed.

       Its just a different kind of corporation.  Instead of board of directors, it is other corporations and banks that are answered to, just in a more subversive way.  Look up the act of 1872.  Preferrably not on wikipedia.

       Trump was a botched revolution against political correctness. The biggest issue with the guy is that he just isn't articulate enough to be a representative of free and direct speech.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I see as the two truly dangerous political forces in America right now are political correctness and identity politics. Political correctness imposes the idea that giving emotional offense is a form of violence worthy of punishment, undermining free speech. Meanwhile, identity politics play a clever game with the minds of their prescribers
       <em>
        and
       </em>
       detractors, because there are so many implicit assumptions about how people work built into identity politics that it is easy to accidentally take them for granted. You go into identity politics thinking that you are better defining your own identity, but you end up a mindless proxy for the most advantageous groups you identify with, undermining individuality.
      </p>
      <p>
       And when both free speech and individuality are compromised, the nation (starting with cyberspace) becomes a Hobbesian battleground of warring identity factions and, because feelings are considered equivalent to the physical form, political argument has a dramatic escalating effect to online conflicts, so that the moment two opposing groups physically meet, physical violence is almost inevitable. Without individualism guiding dialogue, people aren't capable of holding disparate views in their minds and actually deliberating away from opinions that they hold dear--an essential part of the moral development of a human being--and moral evolution is stunted.
      </p>
      <p>
       The conditions are ripe for totalistic forces to gain traction in such an environment, and I think that's why this is being so encouraged by the MSM. It plays right into the proclivities of the typical internet troll, who will inevitably and unwittingly bolster the power of this movement away from rationality with the sheer desire to produce chaos. It's an indulgence of humanity's darkest desires to feed an engine of domination.

       I agree. His plans for the Afghanistan war signal a permanent continuation of the Military Industrial complex. Saber rattling at Pakistan also provides the groundwork for future wars.

       It's revolutionary how he won--the internet-- and he's revolutionary for opening the path for basically anyone. I reaallly hope Jesse Ventura keeps his promise and runs.

       It's still early in trump's admin; expect a turning point in 2018.

       Lol, Can you imagination Jesse running against trump? It would be a goat rodeo. Debates would end with body slams, twitter would be maelstrom of gibberish.  The talking heads would be twisting themselves in knots trying to string together one coherent sound bite.  Don't get me wrong I love Jesse. I live in Minnesota and thought he did fine as governor.  But neither one of those too can hold their composure well enough to keep a good public face. We don't need the rest of the world seeing that.

       I'm not saying venture isn't viable.  I'm just saying he's a wind bag. I love him, but he has no filter. With two candidates like that, it would be too hard to take ourselves seriously as a nation.  And no.. revolutionary is defiantly not the first word that comes to mind there.

       I still believe he is. Look no further than tv. Trump receives constant ridicule from all MSM on a daily basis and most of which is out of context or just a blatant lie. You say deep state approved I don't. Just look at the last 8 years if you want to see a deep state puppet.

       There is something revolutionary about Trump - his presidency confirms what we all have thought for a long time. There is some major behind the scenes power at play here. I truly believe that Trump went into office to change things and shake things up. No other president in living memory has gone into office with an explicitly ant-establishment stance. You are right that here, now, 8 months in he's pivoted to the establishment positions, but that wasn't what he went in there to do.
      </p>
      <p>
       We don't know what's going on behind the scenes, but at this point it should be obvious to anyone that a president cannot fix the system. Bernie would have gone exactly the same way. You either pivot, or you get JFK'ed

       There's room for debate but I would disagree. I don't know as much about Nixon, but Reagan came in to implement economic and military policies that were widely accepted within the right-leaning establishment. He took advantage of a new / budding constituency to help his electoral chances, but his positions were pretty moderate right-center. Lower taxes, less regulation, aggressive military stance towards Russia. Trump, on the other hand, came in on a platform that everyone in the establishment left, right, and center was staunchly against. You could read an article about him from the New Republic or the Weekly Standard and you'd be hard pressed to tell which was which.

       There's no real way to know that. All we can do is look at the playing field and infer. Based on what the media has looked like before and after the election I think that's unlikely. If Trump had every intention of coming into office and being another Bush then I would have expected the conservative establishment to have been friendlier towards him. Or, I'd expect them to be hostile at first and then following some closed door meeting with a campaign manger or adviser they'd change their tune. We didn't see that happen. The conservative press and establishment were deeply hostile to Trump for the entire run up to the election, and have remained so since.  This is a conspiracy sub, and I'm sympathetic to conspiracies as they are well documented in history, but I can't really buy a conspiracy to elect Trump that involves Trump and the conservative establishment colluding to look like they are against each-other so that he could get into office via anti-establishment sentiment and then pivot. You are of course free to make up your own mind however you want, but I think Trump was really sincere, but he had no idea what he was getting himself into.

       Paul Ryan bent the knee, Ted Cruz bent the knee, nearly all notable republicans bent the knee. Where are you getting this imagined hostility? Fox news has entire programs devoted to getting out his message. Trump IS the Republican party, with minor opponents within it. If he can't get anything done, it's entirely his fault.

       He didn't want to fix the system. He wanted to be popular, lose the election, and make $$$.
      </p>
      <p>
       Instead he got elected and is realizing he doesn't know how to lead. I think he really tries to bring in good advisors, he's just failed at that so far - or is unwilling to listen to them.

      <p>
       I hope you can take a little imaginary stroll with me
      </p>
      <p>
       Imagine we are walking through some unknown forest, where everything seems pure and whole
      </p>
      <p>
       The trees make you believe they are stuck firmly in the ground, the dirt path seems straight and strong and the animals seem so blissfully jubilant they could give Snow White's creatures a run for their money
      </p>
      <p>
       after a few minutes of walking on this trail, you begin to wonder if things may not appear as they seem; there is visibly explicit and implied that make you wonder otherwise, but you are determined to walk on the trail because it is your trail, your decision, and your ego that can't make you turn back
      </p>
      <p>
       what once looked like an immovably anchored forest is really a once-beautiful timberland that has just begun the throws of death; hollowed out trunks, rotten roots, and goliaths toppling, or, very recently toppled, down to the ground at a rate that makes you wonder if you can even make it back out alive
      </p>
      <p>
       the dirt trail becomes muddied with what seems to be black tar; everything it touches it steals and never gives back. Soon you start to lose your shoes, your socks, and occasionally you become stuck in the pit, struggling to get out. But it is your trail, your decision to walk on it, and your ego that will see you to the end
      </p>
      <p>
       you hope that the wildlife will lend a helping hand, as their brilliantly inviting visages make them out to be. They surround you when you are deep in the tarpit, devising a plan to save you and your soul. They claim they need to borrow your wallet, watch, car keys, and spectacles, to have the proper resources to craft an escape for you. Reluctantly, you hand over everything because you think they have your greater interest in mind. Piece by piece, some squirrel or pigeon rakes the article you gave it and flies away into the canopy, leaving you broke and stranded
      </p>
      <p>
       my friend, I will not argue with you for you are already deep in the pit. There is no reason to try to ration with you, as your ego has delivered you to the destruction of your own fate; however long that destruction takes. Sure someone may show up on the trail to save you as your nose is about to go under, just to pull you from safety; but the tar is still on you. No matter what you do from now on, I chance to say you're as deep in the muck as Alex Fields Jr. No. Don't try to bring me into the swamp with you, I don't need your filth
      </p>
      <p>
       the man (I can only assume) you support is the personification of this imaginary forest. He seemed to be this impeccable creation that must have been brought down from the heavens! He was your savior!! Of course that man would deliver you from the evil and injustice that burdened you in the past! Hell, I bet a cleverly advertised banana could galvanize you twats into tiki-torch marches. But you have chosen to
       <em>
        run
       </em>
       down that path, ignoring the obvious signs of reality, in favor of the image you had crafted in your mind. You are so stuck in the muck that you still can't believe that maybe you were wrong? Maybe these libtards and their purple hair have a point? Maybe this trumpster fire doesn't reflect true republican values? But what do I know, I'm just some shmuck on the internet.

       You're right. He's no Hillary but he's probably just as bad. No one could see the future, you try to believe a candidate on their campaign promises and considering that being a complete rookie in politics he had no background in fucking his constituents and poor people over (with fiscal policy), he gave you more hope in his campaign promises than Hillary. But it turns out he panders as much every other president has been since JFK.

       Maybe to fight back against the coalition who was against him from the beginning? He's not so against the media until they start dragging his name in the mud. It's not a smart tactic, but it's obviously cause and effect.

       During the election I wish I had been more pro-third party and less anti-hillary. Even with what he's done, I think I prefer Trump over Hillary, but they're both awful awful choices, and that's by design. It's clear the military-industrial complex controls our elections

       We are not at war Syria, if anything we were in a proxy war with Obama when he was funding the rebels over there (i.e.ISIS). There is no nuclear war with any viable threat (NK is an ant), and the jury is still out with the intervention in the east. Obama deployed 100k troops to afghanistan and Trump has so far only sent 4k.

       I think you should be asking why the eclipse went west to east.
      </p>
      <p>
       because that means the sun moved.
      </p>
      <p>
       it isn't suppose to move in the helio centric model.

       nasa says thr moon circles the earth at 2x earth rotation.  So once every twelve hours?   what?

      <p>
       moon takes 28 days to do its phases.  can't say around because seems like it isn't doing that.

       The first one is because it's projected on to a sphere, that should be obvious.
      </p>
      <p>
       The second one is because the moon goes the same direction as the earth spins. However the earth spins faster than the moon revolves, so the net effect is that it goes west to east slowly in the sky, compared to the sun. Both overall go east to west as we see them in the sky, but the moon goes slower.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's like if two cars were racing, and you were sitting in the faster car, looking at the slower car go "backwards". It's not really going backwards, it's just outpaced by the faster frame of reference

       I still go there to read the latest memes or what's trending, but lately I've become disillusioned to their "You're with us or against us" attitude. No critical thinkers allowed basically. Whatever, they'll implode on their own eventually. The first crack was his Cabinet picks. A lot of rich people who had their hands at elite jobs. The next crack in the "wall" was the attack on Syria with all those Tomahawk missiles. I expect the last straw will be his "no more nation building" statement backfiring on him once some false-flag situation happens and the whole nation is dragged into another god-awful war. Either be "woke" or stay brain-dead. No 5D chess happening here. He's lost Bannon, Priebus, Flynn and possibly Sessions later down the road.

       But that's my point. They're being unreasonable by not allowing for critical thinking. Remember the whole "firing cruise missiles at the Syrian airfield" debacle? That was one of the major turning points in convincing many people (including myself) on how not everything was jolly in la-la-land. So fuck off with your negative tone &amp; attack. If you can't see that it's the same-old tactics created by the Establishment/Deep-State priesthood then you should get-the-fuck-out of this subreddit. Conspiracy is practically the last bastion of free-thinkers. We all can disagree or agree with someone's theory, but on the T_D it's all or nothing for them.

       I would be more inclined to believe that if he wasn't attacked not stop by the media. He's clearly not part of the agenda. How much power and sway he actually has is up for debate however.

       It's almost like it's a smart idea to look at people's past behavior and like, idk, use it to estimate how they'll behave in the future???? But like... That's just crazytalk. Just because we have literally decades of video evidence of Trump's horrendous, sexist, racist, vile, greedy behavior means NOTHING, right???

       I wouldn't say that the average person is by any means stupid. In general America and most of the world is made up of mostly decent people just trying to make ends meet day after day. Generations of indoctrination and blind faith in the bullshit system we have today is the reason we have Trump.

       Sounds kinda like you're trying to do that thing where we're talking about common sense things and then you exaggerate it to make it something that liberals have disliked in the past so you can get your 'gotcha!' moment. Like when we were campaigning for Gay Marriage and all the Republicans started saying shit like 'What's next, marrying ducks!? Walls? CHILDREN???' because there's nothing like talking about X and having someone respond like you said 78 (I didn't use a letter because it's supposed to indicate that it's not even in the same realm of consideration, get it?) and then being mad at you that you are clearly defending and support 78 and you should be disgusted and ashamed with yourself, how dare you.

       Many did, Hillary having a career of being a warhawk was the deciding factor for many. Trump campaigned on stopping wars. They may not have believed him on much, but some chance of it happening was better than none.

       Kind of funny that now he's doing the exact opposite of stopping wars. And IDK why I run into like five out of five hundred people that say Hilary was a 'warmonger' or 'warhawk'- admittedly, I am not well versed on her history so I suppose it's possible I just never heard about what she did, but if she really was this horrible warhawk wouldn't we have like many years of concrete examples, or have more of the public knowledge about it? Like- outside of Benghazi I couldn't tell you one other talking point brought up to prove she was hungry for war. So why does she have that reputation? It's not like the men in that same job that she was doing didn't also make calls similar to the ones she's made, we've lost troops in war before it's not like having a woman in the seat suddenly made them start dying, so why is it everyone acts like because she was the one there it labels her a warmonger? That's like working at dairy queen and being labeled an ice cream fucker just because the guy before you used to fuck the icecream.

       Go to youtube and type 'trump speaking', there's your evidence. Are you really trying to act like there isn't mountains of evidence on Trump? Seriously? LOLOLOLOLOL, christ- I mean I'm used to people acting like Feminism and the Wage Gap don't exist, but even most Trumpists are smart enough to know that their cheeto in power has plenty of negative press behind him- they defend him regardless, of course, because talking about what size breasts your daughter will have isn't enough to drive them away- but like, they KNOW it exists. You really don't know, darlin'?

       To be fair, all Trump has in his life is what he perceives people perceive about him, so in that regard, I think he genuinely thought this was a slam dunk to be beloved on a massive scale.
      </p>
      <p>
       It highlights both his unquenchable thirst to be loved by people he'll never meet and his gross overestimation of his abilities.

       Exactly! The conspiracy here is that people actually thought that at one point? I was told a long time ago that when you want answers you do one thing "follow the money". Look trump didn't get his money off of something like oil. He made his money off of investment properties and inheritance. Meaning he's got people all across the world who are oligarchs and tycoons, the upper class who have helped him and he's helped. You think anything is going to change? Hell no. Billionaires will always be billionaires and just like anyone else they are going to keep things the way they are instead of changing things. Any changes what so ever are going to duck up some billionaires, and no other billionaire is going to try to make that happen

       And your solution to that is someone who thinks wages are too high? Someone who has a long history of failed ventures with zero experience in government and zero interest in anyone but himself, someone who has time and time again passed the buck, refused to pay his contractors, blamed everyone in the world but himself, and that's the person you think is capable of or even inclined to fix anything but his own wallet?

       Things were not good for most people. You're living in a world of the make-believe. That is my point I am calling you out on. You won't admit that you realized you are wrong about that - so you attack Trump (who was never mentioned in this comment chain).

       I acknowledged there were issues, issues that need fixing, but overall most people weren't living in poverty. Sure, we all could be doing better if those few at the top weren't absorbing all the new money, but the way to solve that isn't to put one of them in charge, knowing he doesn't have the desire or ability to do anything about it, knowing that he's going to use the opportunity to do nothing but line his own pockets.
      </p>
      <p>
       And again, the entire post is about Trump. Look up. The post: Trump. The parent comment: Trump. Bringing up the subject of the post isn't "shill behavior".

       Again, you're blatantly mischaracterizing what I said. Lying, basically. Things were pretty good. Yes, things could have been better. Yes, there were still big issues. But the solution is not th just burn it down and pick someone who demonstrated at every turn that they had no plan, no real agenda other than spite, no capability to solve any issues, and no interest in anything but his own money and ego.

       Sidenote: Who would even be paying people to say that the past few years were mostly okay? Is it really that controversial to say that crime, unemployment, and poverty rates were at low points? Is everybody a shill just for saying that electing an egomaniac who cares only about his own image and money is a stupid solution to the problems we did face?

       Your immediate and repeated reaction to me saying 2015 was okay is to call me a shill and an idiot. And you accuse me of being stubborn. Guess what, poverty, crime, unemployment, those were all low. Things were okay for most people; I never said they were perfect, and in fact I repeatedly said they weren't. What I said was that you don't fix issues by electing people who don't care about anything but their own money and ego, people who actively want to worsen the issues.

       <em>
        so much
       </em>
       that when presented with one of the many fabricated narratives, they first) automatically doubted it and second) were primed to believe the opposite. All you had to do was watch any of the daily rallies Trump was doing during his campaigning and you would immediately see everything that was being told to you was a lie.

       Trump did speak out against the fed saying we need a gold backed currency (even tho I don't agree and think we should give the federal reserve responsibilities to congress where we can actually vote ppl out for making bad monetary decisions) but he did speak out on this. Also Mnuchin is actually traveling to fort knox to see if there actually is any gold there which in my mind is legendary conspiracy status.

       I actually think you're all missing the point and that he's just a global distraction from how completely fucked we are due to climate change, which is accelerating and which will be the fucken end of most of us within about 20 years.
      </p>
      <p>
       Biggest fucking diversion of all time. There's just no realistic scenario wherein Trump doesn't believe in global warming. He knows it's real. He knows how dire our situation is, along with countless other important political figures. They can't and won't explain it to us because everybody will panic.
      </p>
      <p>
       He is nothing more than a gigantic distraction from true reality: We're fucking all dead within a couple/a few decades. WHO CARES ABOUT THIS SHIT? Get over it, for fucks sake, quit falling for the stage show.

       To me, the fact that Trump is in office is a result of his being a gigantic global distraction. How often do you hear about environmental issues anymore? It's just trump this, trump that, bla bla bla. Who fucking cares. The planet itself is about to fuck us up. Most people have conveniently forgotten or were never aware.

       Nazis! Gays! Transgenders! Racial issues! Quite fucking literally every emotionally charged issue slammed in our faces all at once on a regular basis, to keep people distracted. The fucken world is imploding around us, fast now. 16 of the past 17 years were the warmest on record. 8 of the 12 months of 2016, 2016 being the hottest ever recorded and 2017 is extremely hot too, with no el nino like last year. Seems to me the feedback systems i keep reading about are amped up and that it's going to keep getting hotter, fast (in relative terms).
      </p>
      <p>
       But yeah. Nazis. Racial issues. Turrurism. Literally ISSUES THAT WILL NEVER AFFECT 99% OF THE POPULATION, VS ISSUES THAT WILL KILL 99% OF THE POPULATION. Fuck man. We're so fucked :/

       It might have already been too late when we were born man. It just makes total sense to me, personally. Trump being a massive distraction because things are getting so weird with the weather, die-offs, and climate everywhere that it's getting hard to ignore. All these other "risks" they've been presenting as mortal dangers.
      </p>
      <p>
       They couldn't tell us about how screwed we are if they knew, they wouldn't. Everything would fall apart before it happens naturally. The only option is deny, not really talk about it much. Climate change got 2% of the 2016 debates. 2 fucking percent. ZERO percent in 2012. They didn't talk about it AT ALL. I think first world powers have decided to keep it all hushed.

       Why does it have to take the PRESIDENT to tell people the world is going shit because of us/humans? They can literally find all of this information online, people just don't care until it's too late. Is there anything I can do to stop from progressing? I'm pescatarian, I carpool with people, recycle. I'm new to sure what else to do. A lot of third world countries are already experiencing most of the climate change impact.

       Trump didn't commit to nation building in Afghanistan. He committed to
       <em>
        invading
       </em>
       Afghanistan. This matches with his campaign rhetoric, which was all about using the United States military for imperialism.

       Blaming solely the left is as stupid as the right. Right wing talk radio has been very inflammatory for a long time, I grew up on it. Fox News invented partisan 24/7 cable alarmism. Breitbart is fear mongering and chief. Voat and 4chan are about as extreme and hateful as it gets. No side gets to claim moral superiority here. Both sides have been taught to hate each other.

       No one benefitted more from identity politics in the 2016 election than Trump. He played to the identities and fears of white voters almost constantly. He called Mexicans rapists. He shared totally fake crime statistics about black people on Twitter (retweeted from a white-supremacist account). He called for a ban on all Muslims. He said an American-born judge with Mexican heritage couldn't be impartial, which the Speaker of the House noted was "textbook racism."
      </p>
      <p>
       At the same time, it became clear that a vocal subsection of his supporters were, at the very least, sympathetic to the ideas of white supremacy. The subreddit devoted to Trump, the largest online forum for Trump supporters, was (and continues to be) rife with racism. I've seen countless posts on T_D that promote white supremacy and racism. Look no further than their stickied post for "Unite the Right" (which states clearly that white-supremacists were involved, but encourages Trump supporters to take part anyway) as evidence of this.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump, a businessman and branding expert, saw this undercurrent of racism and white supremacy bubbling under the surface and capitalized on it. It was basic supply and demand. He signaled to them both overtly and covertly that he was with them, and they heard him loud and clear.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump's recent comment about Charlottesville, where he noted that there were "very fine people" at a rally organized and attended by white supremacists, is a great example of what I'm talking about.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not saying all Trump supporters are white supremacists (they aren't). I'm saying that if you're decrying identity politics, no one is guiltier of using them than President Donald J. Trump.

       If any of you jackoffs voted for Trump because you thought he was some kind of revolutionary outsider, you deserve everything you get. He's a spoiled billionaire born with his silver spoon up his ass and got richer off media and real estate. He's the kind of person who buys politicians and erodes democracy. He invited the Clintons to his fucking wedding!

       I didn't call him evil just for voting, I called him a dumb evil fuck because of who he voted FOR.

       That still doesn't justify calling him evil dude. Sure you could call him dumb for not voting the way you wanted him to, whatever. Honestly that's pretty dumb but you can. But evil? That doesn't make any sense. Trump isn't an evil man and has done nothing to warrant that accusation. I'll be impressed if you can actually tell me how he is evil because all I'm seeing is bullshit and slander from the establishment media because they didn't get their chosen puppet.

       He has sexually assaulted women and is proud to boast about it. He's engaged in illegal racist discrimination against black renters and had to settle for it. He promotes racism and xenophobia. I consider him venial and evil, and if you voted for him and STILL would, then you must be aware of and on board with his evil.

       Wrong on all accounts my friend. That was just locker room talk. You have to be fucking retarded to take that literally. Stop being a pussy and acting like men don't talk like that amongst themselves. It was locker room guy talk. Nothing more.

       The discrimination against renters is also complete bullshit. He was running a business and simply trying to his property value high. Look at the organization that levied that bs against him. They're race pimps and constantly looking for shit like this. Nothing more.

       Millions of men talk about girls every day in a sexual manner. You can pretend people haven't been doing it for centuries to fit your narrative but I'm not going to participate in your PC fantasy. You're an absolute moron if you don't think men and women talk like that everyday.

       lol upset that even his last rally in Phoenix was bigger than any of Hillarys rally by a factor of 100? Again, this just proves you haven't seen any of his rallies because it's not just white people there you racist piece of shit :) And because you have obvious difficulties with basic math let me explain to you why there are so many white people there. We make up the majority of the country, you fucking moron. This isn't rocket science but I'll be happy to get you a lab coat if it helps. God you're dumb lol.

       Another thing. You remember all those women that came out of the wood work during the election saying he molested them? You remember them? You remember how every single one of them ended up being scams? Doesn't that tell you something? Didn't you see that and think, ' hm... Something is not right here. That's never happened to a president before...' The establishment didn't get their way so they tried to assassinate his character and hoped it would be enough to cost him the election before investigations discovered they were all lies. That's what really happened, my friend. He's not your enemy. He's a good man and he's fighting to save our nation for the very establishment that tried to destroy him.

       The argument that Trump spoke with raw emotional truth to a disaffected demographic is some of the most tired bullshit I've heard about him. He targeted people who suffer from the income divide and used the age old tactic of whispering in their ear that dark skinned people are the root of their problems. Classic bait and switch by a criminal with mob ties played on people he believes to be very very stupid. In a huge way.

       Good work, there are the 3 points continuously levied by Trump since he announced his campaign and you will
       <strong>
        never
       </strong>
       find him explicitly or even implicitly saying anything worse than that. See, the difference between his voters and you is his voters actually watched his speeches, and all you did was watch and read people who get paid to lie about what he said at rallies and then you believed it because you'd rather that your feel-good hallucinations continued than have to confront the depth of your own ignorance.

       He encouraged violence toward dissenting voices and promised to implement xenophobic anti immigration tactics that he just couldn't carry out along with his failed promise to repeal obamacare. The guys a fucking loser who needs to be told how great he is.
      </p>
      <p>
       He's fragile and toxic and represents the worst America has to offer. You can cast aspersions on to me as a person but you carry the message that a corrupt media that is out to get the great orange clown and this desperate paranoia really only goes to highlight the fan boy fanaticism in your character, something that is required to be a Trump supporter.
      </p>
      <p>
       The media has never been kind to presidents. They weren't kind to Obama, in fact Trump was immeasurably more vicious toward Obama than anyone has been to Trump and his fragile ego.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can just watch the man talk with your own eyes and see that he's only saying what he thinks he needs to say to push an agenda. He's only ever known dishonest business. He has shown his true colors many times and no flurry of emotional misinformation can close my eyes to the atrocity that our country, all of us, have shamefully allowed to happen.

       Honestly, Clinton's corruption was a much much bigger story that was not getting honest press. I know that is uncomfortable or even offensive to people but you can't rationalize literal treason in any comparable way to "grab 'em by the pussy" and its the media' s fault on both acciunts. Had they done their job honestly it wouldn't have been either Trump or Clinton.

       Probably because there's no real proof of Clinton's corruption. Literally none. All the unfavorable ties to the Clinton foundation were proven to be hearsay or circumstantial with no evidence to back it up. The best people have is "money flowed to the Clinton foundation around the same time as...[insert any action she made as secretary of state]...but it was illogical since they're one of the biggest charities on the planet who ALWAYS have money flowing to them. They have open books and Hillary has public tax returns. 30 years of probes and investigations of the Clinton's and all they could get to stick was lying about a blowjob. They spent 200 million just on benghazi and emails and found NOTHING illegal or corrupt. Meanwhile Trump literally made a career of corruption and working w the mpb

       I beg to differ She admitted the US was arming Al Qaeda through Saudi and Qatar. That is literally the definition of Misprision of Treason. Unless She did tell Obama then that's where the buck stops.

       It isn't literally the definition of treason, as we're not at war with Saudi Arabia or Qatar, and Al Qaeda is not a nation-state. Here is the definition:

       Essentially, the executive branch Knew that the hundred billion dollars of weapons the sold to Saudi and Qatar were being used to fund / train / arm ISIS and Al Qaeda. Which is knowingly giving direct/indirect aid and comfort to federally recognized enemies of the state.

       This last link isnt in support of Trump, more of a recognition of facts supporting what Gabbard was saying.

       That people think Trump is an insider when every media organization left of and including Breitbart has no problem going heavily critical of him is the sort of mental failure worthy of psychological literature exploring how a huge percentage of the population is completely incapable of metacognition.

       You should look inward. Can't you see how much bank the media has made off this presidency? You think they would've made the same money off Clinton's boring politics? No. The media MADE Trump into a candidate and propelled him into the presidency. If you think for one second Trump isn't playing their game then I have a bridge to sell you.

       Tell that to his Goldman Sachs, big oil and coal cabinet. He's not a political insider persay, but to act like he's not acting in the best interest of billionaires like himself and against the best interest of average Americans is to be blind.

       And he is a great distraction from the fact that nothing has changed. The key players in Washington are selling out America just as they have for the past 40 years. But people are too focused on our president to notice or care that the system is still rigged against them and is becoming even more rigged every day.

       Pretty sure Trump was an establishment/Clinton plant.
      </p>
      <p>
       1)  Clinton didn't want to take over this America.  An America that will probably go back into recession soon and be engaged in a lot more foreign conflict.  She didn't want to be blamed.
      </p>
      <p>
       2)  Clinton ties run deep, and the next DNC candidate will be in hock to the Clintons anyway.  It might almost be better for Clinton to stay as shadow government head behind the scenes.
      </p>
      <p>
       3)  Trump getting elected was further testing of America's propensity for moronicity.  First, it was Reagan.  He did so well, they tried Bush.  Now they've downgraded to Trump.  Next, they'll sell us Kim Kardashian for president.

       This is such a circle jerk.  No one voted for Trump because we were dismayed over Afghanistan,  most voters cheered on enlarging the military and deferring to generals.
      </p>
      <p>
       On the issues we votes TRUMP for he sure as hell is trying or succeeding.  And we'll back him in the midterms and 2020 too.

       The only thing revolutionary about Trumps election is that it made all the ignorant people who still had their head stuck in the ground about the illusion of choice between dem vs rep to wake up and realize that politics are phony and the president is a puppet. Trump himself may not be revolutionary, but at least his election helped wake up the rest of the people who still thought that our system was perfect.

       I think people are overestimating trump's intelligence here. The staggering amount of scandal, division, etc. wasn't part of some master plan he thought out. He continuously shoots himself in the foot with his tweets, his hires and his policies.
      </p>
      <p>
       Media won't report negatively on wall st, big oil, etc. no matter who's in office. There's so much corporate overlap that expecting anything more from them is all but a pipe dream. that's like believing self policing  works.

       Trump is more of libertarian thats why he isn't really that right wing  but since leftist are now communist supporters he was still the better choice. Already Trump has helped the economy for example by saying no to the Paris Agreement and at least brought patriotism back.

       Obama was a diaster of epic proportions the worst president to date. Obama created the ISIS while selling American citizens out for Mexican criminals and Islamic terrorist.

       Hillary Clinton was fall down pantsuit retarded which only attracted people who had brain damage. Hillary's  main operation was starting world war 3 by bringing in millions of  3world unchecked muslims so George Soros can consolidate power since chaos is a ladder.

       I didn't support either candidate but I said if trump gets through lobbyist rules and term limits his presidency would be a net win for the people. So far none of that is even close to coming true.

       Like He or any President before him actually had a choice. The country is run by elites.

       The true rulers of this country and most likely the world have an agenda, and we are not privy to that agenda, and neither was Trump.

       Why do you want to be lied to and given an act? One of the biggest reasons I voted trump was because he spoke like a real person and didn't act and talk like the cookie cutter politician and when he debated it was all real time and not speeches and counter arguments that had been rehearsed hundreds of times like the people he ran against.

       I would argue that both "sides" are providing cover for the same old swamp.  All of those in the streets fighting "white supremacists" or for gender equality might as well have cast their ballots for Trump for all that they are helping him and those who guide him to keep things running just as before.

       The issue is instead of fighting for individual policies the people follow party lines and demigods. Trump has some good policies, Bernie did, Hillary did. All the candidates did. Instead of picking policies we pick people.

       Trump is a convenient scapegoat for those who are blind to the fact that it's the deep state that's really the one in power.  Trump is nothing and a nobody.  He's a hood ornament on a car.  The deep state's the actual car.

       He brings the added bonus that all politicians before and after him will now be seen as relatively sensible and trustworthy. Even Bill Maher uttered something about how he would be happy to have a Bush right now. Meanwhile, the suddenly political masses will be so worn out by 'participation' under Trump that future leaders will be able to sneak even more past us. It happened a year earlier here in Australia with Tony Abbott.

       I love how you still blame trump. When clearly its the establishment that has him by the balls. Reality is the president is but a publicity face to apease the public. Whilst the real ruling elite make all the decisions. Hence why nothing changes. Even russia straight up states this. They dont care who is president, as they roughly know what US is doing, going, planning. That level of confidence doesnt come from a single person.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trumps level of hate is rational, the government has to do some crazy shit, and they put up two pieces of shit for the public to choose from. Eitherway the people woukd have hated hillary the same way. It allows the public to focus on the personality of trump and direct their hate towards him, as the congress and elite direct the nation in the direction they want. Which in this case is still the same war effort, influence of their political and economic will through milotary force. Etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hence why people need to wake up, stop fighting stupid battles with each other, the conflict created and fueld by the media(which we know is controlled and filled with propoganda). And focus on the real evil. The shadow gov, the establishment, the corrupt and descietful elite.

       very astute.   I've heard it said by very smart people that they felt Trump was pretty much EXACTLY the same as Reagan, Bush, Clinton, Bush, and Obama with regards to "what matters".  i.e. perpetuate war machine and further corporate/police state.  All the apparent differences between them are in order to allow the people to feel they have a say, but it is like sending a kid to bed but giving him the choice of jammies or toothbrushing first, so he feels he has some control.

       Its all a money making scam. Why do we never see Antifa or "40k protesters" at a Trump rally? We see a lot of Trump supporters, a lot of capitalism going on on the sidewalk and loads of security. Why can we not see this at a "free speech" rally or a "nazi" rally, which is a constitutional right by all American CITIZENS? Because violence sells. Just look who profits most.

       Yep. But he's so stupid and inept that the establishment is revealing how shit they are to even more people. Without Trump healthcare as a basic human right would not have gained majority support. It was his foolish attempts to repeal ACA that lead to more people than ever noticing that even with the ACA peopke were still dying from lack of healthcare.

       Trump doesn't see conspiracy theories as something to get rid of. He uses them as currency to build up a following and grab some elite power for himself. For god's sake he had an overtly fascist platform on police, surveillance, free press, mass incarceration, etc.

       Congratulations on getting your
       <em>
        opinion
       </em>
       to the front page. But let's talk about that opinion.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump is a Real Estate Mogul/Reality TV star that got elected to the most powerful position of the planet with ZERO political experience. That's pretty revolutionary.
      </p>
      <p>
       He just committed to
       <em>
        NOT
       </em>
       nation building. Did we watch the same statement? Apparently not.
      </p>
      <p>
       The money for the wall is already approved.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are indeed mass deportations already. See people getting arrested literally everywhere they go whether it's at work or the local courthouse.
      </p>
      <p>
       We drove Mexico and Canada to the negotiating table over NAFTA so apparently he
       <em>
        does
       </em>
       have some leverage.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is a perfect example of driving bullshit content to the front page to serve an agenda. That's the real conspiracy here. You've never posted in this sub before but you throw blatant lies and your admittedly liberal bias out there and what do ya know!? You're on the front page.

       I am open to criticism of trump. I disagree with many of his stances. I didn't like his stance on private prisons for example.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I LISTEN to criticism; I don't bullshit around it pointing to the left and doing a false equivalence.
      </p>
      <p>
       WAIT FOR EVIDENCE AND USE EVIDENCE FOR CLAIMS: the anti trump baseless vitriol deflects from ACTUAL (and valid) criticism of Trump
      </p>
      <p>
       Many of you claimed he'd sign the TPP as a billionaire, but he didn't. How do you know he's not actually trying in Afghanistan?
      </p>
      <p>
       FFS he used the MOAB and bombed a former CIA created terrorist tunnel structure. And he supports never ending war occupation? Or is he trying to actually end it

       It's not even conspiracy, it's just common media non-coverage/manipulation and politics. Happens all the time with every president (not only US), but big orange is the one that makes it the most obvious and most outrageous.

       My problem with Bernie is that he wanted more government. And the government always end up being corrupt. I liked some of his ideas though.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also I am not sure about his position on 2nd amendment but if he is far left then that means he wants it to be diminished as much as possible. Every conspiracy user should support the second amendment because our founding fathers put that there as protection against the government.

       I am not invested in any of them because i understand there is an oligarchy. I dont give a shit about trump, hillary, bush, bill clinton, obama or any of the fucking NWO puppets you choose to worship. Anyone caught up in the left right nonsense is the fucking problem, not the solution.

       Wow you people really still believe he will be 're elected when he had 3 million less votes, has a high level investigation with multiple grand juries impaneled, his presidential regime falling apart since almost day 1(how many people has he fired now? And at least 2 were fired for investigating him), his approval at historically low levels for ANY president ever, and you all still push this nonsense as if anyone believes you.

       I didn't say that. I was just pointing out that you posted an article about Trump's approval from February 14th for some odd reason. At least use current (or his lowest, which is current) polling.

       Truman and Nixon's lowest were 22%. Bush was 25%. Obama's lowest was 38%. Trump's quoted latest approval rating by "accurate" polls is 35%. So no, not historically low levels for ANY president ever, you liar.

       I would agree with you but I have started to see Trump as a total idiot. I mean some of the stuff he has stated and done has actually made things worse for himself so I just don't' see him (anymore) as this calculating person but more like a bumbling idiot who falls half-ass backward into the presidency.

       Thank you for admitting that. If you're a Trump supporter, it's hard to talk negatively about someone who promised so much. He's not your hero, but someone better can take his place!

       It has been understood by military and foreign policy experts that 'pulling out' of Afganistan was a mistake that created a vacuum. It is obvious that despite the appearance of perpetuation, Trump's plan differs dramatically. Pseudo-intellectuals and propagandists are using this opportunity to take a jab at Trump, to convince people that he is just the same old trickster.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not true, though. The firing of James Comey, investigation of the Awan brothers, Donald Trump Jr. heeding the advice of Julian Assange, Assange potentially working with Trump to disprove the Russian interference narrative, the investigations into the Lynch and Clinton meeting, etc... the fabrication of the Russian interference by Brennan and acceptance by Rogers and Clapper. The leaked phone calls of Trump, indicating his sincerity. Steve Bannon, Matt Drudge, Andrew Breitbart's targeting of corrupt individuals, exposing various scandals. James O'Keefe's expose of CNN and other outlets working against Trump.
      </p>
      <p>
       If people believe Trump is another deep stay trickster, they are stupid. Trump is not "anti-establishment". That is a strawman narrative created by idiots. Trump is anti-globalism, not "anti-establishment", he's representing a nationalistic front harping back to the Reagan days, which almost got Reagan killed. His whole F'ing based gets this, the anti-globalism, the nationalism, Reaganism, etc. and it's simply others who are claiming he's an anti-establishment figure as a pretext to dismiss him on the grounds of violating anti-establishment principles. Even so, he's still more anti-establishment than any other president we've had but that's not what's really going on here.

      <p>
       You fundamentally do not understand why we are in Afghanistan and why we continue to be in Afghanistan.
      </p>
      <p>
       We are in Afghanistan for a number of reasons, but primarily to build the trans Afghan pipeline that has been under construction from almost the moment we invaded. As each completion deadline has come and gone, so has our scheduled withdrawal.
      </p>
      <p>
       Big oil and the US has wanted to build a pipeline in Afghanistan for, I believe, over 60 years, but has been unable to do so due to the geopolitics in the area. It is in our strategic interests if you are to believe the
       <a href="http://www.heritage.org/europe/report/secure-and-stable-caspian-sea-americas-interest">
        heritage foundation
       </a>
       . That makes sense. If you've been paying attention, the geopolitics in the area since 2001 have been overtly to undermine Russian interests in the area.
      </p>
      <p>
       And because you don't understand that, it's likely that your conclusion about Trump is wrong too.

       Slightly off topic, but I also learned today that opium production on Afghanistan has gone gang busters since the U.S. intervened in 2001. Supposedly 90%+ of the opium used to supply the global heroin trade. To fixate on regime change within Afghanistan and 'fighting terror', yet enable the floodgates on supply of a drug that is recognised as scourge the world over would seem counter-productive 'at best'.

       Food for thought, and maybe I've missed it, but what happened to backing out of the Iran deal? Seems that after he visited Saudi Arabia, all talk about the Iran deal stopped. Am I missing something?

       you really gonna act like some washed up celebrity attention whoring (who probably doesn't even pay attention to politics) is actually calling for his assassination?
      </p>
      <p>
       c'mon man. these liberals are just being trendy because being a social justice warrior is the hip thing to do in their liberal progressive circles. none of them are actually going to try to kill Trump.
      </p>
      <p>
       maybe a crazy person who takes what the media says all to seriously will come along like Micah Johnson.
      </p>
      <p>
       speaking of media, the reason they run all this anti Trump stuff 24/7 is because it brings in huge ratings, but it's also contributing to even more Trump hate, it's a vicious never ending circle.
      </p>
      <p>
       that being said. the dude is not a revolutionary at all and he's already backed off from the stuff he promised that could be considered revolutionary. when's that swamp gonna get drained? never. when's that wall gonna get built? never. he's just another politician, he's not what you thought he was, or he was but changed his tune when he realized they'd kill him, which makes him a pussy.

       I'm pretty sure Clinton wouldn't spend every weekend at an extremely expensive golf-resort and then charge her secret service for staying there, in the end charging them so much that they don't even have much funding left after less than a year (All the while pocketing that money).
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm pretty sure Clinton wouldn't go on endless tirades about being witch hunted by the 'fake media' , so much so that that would be 98% of what she spoke about (Hint: She was and has been witch hunted for far longer than Donny).
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm pretty sure Clinton wouldn't literally try and assfuck our environment and planet by trying to get 'clean coal' back on the market.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm pretty sure Clinton would have a functioning government and cabinet instead of having one where it seems that every other day someone leaves or is forced out, and where everyone is trying to backstab each other.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can keep going for a while with this.

       No, Clinton would not have been the same 'side of the coin.'

       It's sad. 4-8 years from now people who voted for him and supported him are going to look back with A LOT of regret, like the next morning after being blackout drunk. Like Republicans—and everyone else—were in 2009 when Bush left the presidency. I can

       Trump is the side-effect of a miscalculation by those in power, the uniparty was completely confident they would elected Hillary and somehow fell for their own lies and misjudged the amount of fraud necessary.
      </p>
      <p>
       This becomes pretty clear when you look at GOP side (Ryan, Romney, McCain, Mitch) and their never Trump stance.
      </p>
      <p>
       Their new found strategy was to promote chaos in the US, with massive propaganda campaign dividing the people, else they risk Trump messing up their plans.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now you clearly have the media, Hollywood, both parties, the EU/UN, all major tech companies (Facebook, Google, Twitter, etc), the alphabet agencies, all aligned with a single goal. So, if you believe they made this alliance for good, you shouldn't be worried at all. As for me, I think it looks like an unholy alliance that can't be up to no good.
      </p>
      <p>
       We are at the point that people are destroying statues, calling for assassinations, openly being racist and discriminating people based on their ethnicity, assassinating cops, believing half the population is white supremacist, burning flags and rationalizing violence as a valid mean to stop dangerous free speech.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've never seen so much hatred for someone in my life, from people that I know never listened to him first hand and get all their information second hand filtered by the media. Almost all Trump policies if proposed by another politician wouldn't cause much if any alarm (probably the most extreme position he took so far was the transgender ban from the military, but even that is just going back to how the policy was a year or so ago).

       You dont think if Hillary sent more troops reddit would be freaking out? What about if she ended net neutrality? Essentially shut down the EPA? Proposed huge tax cuts for the wealthy? Quadrupled drone strikes and civilian casualties? Expanded the war on drugs and private prison industry. There is a lot of selective out rage at Trump but he also does some shitty things that most people assume a Democrat wouldnt have.

       Regardless, criticizing Trump for his actions or his policies you disagree is fair, no problem with that. Persecuting the guy for things he clearly don't believe in like racism, white supremacy, defaming him, saying he is a fascist, etc is unacceptable. If most of the criticism against him was grounded in reality we would be in a much better place, unfortunately that is too much to ask apparently.

       I think Trump is a schemer with his own agenda like 90% of politicians but I dont think hes an insider on the deep state, ptsb(powers that shouldnt be).

       I feel like his whole adminstration is political theatre to distract from the ever growing facist one world government thats emerging tbh. We look at his antics and the rest of the world looks at his antics while hiding the fact that governments everywhere are slowly taking away more and more human rights.

       I think the president has some pull on things that are highly publicized and talked about, but most big decision making comes from lobbyists and suits behind closed doors. He was definitely the better pick between him and Hillary. It is literally not even close.

       OMG this sub is actually admitting trumps not for the american people? The trump ass kissing in here has finally stopped? I was just under the impression that the sub was for critical thinkers and I could not take anybody serious who claims to be that and was a supporter of trump. People kept coming up with excuses for his actions over and over again while claiming to be critical thinkers and I am just like you are not a fucking critical thinker I am sorry. Glad to see people are finally waking up and smelling the coffee.

      <p>
       Except that's literally a war crime.  I'm not saying it couldn't be obfuscated with red tape, but it's not as simple as you're making it out.  Plenty of nations would have motivation to call out a war crime of that magnitude when it starts infringing on their own mineral profits.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm also not convinced there's enough there to be profitable.  You're dealing against established competition who are not having to operate under duress, and there's no known minerals there in sufficient quantities that have particular strategic or economic value.

       This. More people need to see this. What I'd like to add is that Cosa Nostra, Sinaloa, and others are working
       <strong>
        for
       </strong>
       the international financial elite class. They're the enforcers for the political class. This is why you rarely see candidates promoting real democratic policy such as ranked voting, term limits for national senators and representatives of the house, etc. (although I did see one state promote ranked voting, very exciting). I'd back that speculation up with the numerous times banks have been caught laundering money for organized crime. IMO it's pretty transparent at this point that the same people manipulating the market are controlling our politics and fighting both sides of a war on drugs via organized crime. That makes government the most organized crime of all.

       No one said they were new. And yes, three Japanese cars, with fabric seats, no extras, and each costing ~$18-24 grand is comparatively modest. Claiming otherwise supports my point; I don't know if you realize just how rich people get. A girlfriend I had I high school bitched me out for driving a "shitty Honda" instead of "at least an Audi".

       It was a 1,400 sq ft ranch with four people living in it. When we first moved in, my two grandmothers lived there too. That house cost an arm and a leg. Part of my point was that making comparatively high income would have been much harder if we weren't living on Long Island. But living on Long Island meant our money didn't go as far it would in other places.

       I don't really appreciate you jumping to these conclusions. My family immigrated from Russia in the 90's. My dad moved here with $300 cash. He worked as a bus driver by day and a taxi driver by night, living with four roommates in an attic apartment in Brooklyn, back when it wasn't advisable for white people to walk around outside after sunset. After a year he saved enough money to bring the rest of my family over. We lived in a barrio on Long Island, in a three family home. My upstairs neighbors were junkies and waking up to gunshots wasn't exactly a rarity. At the time, my dad started his business and we were splitting $30 grand between six people. Eventually, my dad made enough money to move into a the aforementioned ranch. My parents have no money that they didn't earn themselves by staying up until two in the morning, night after night for two decades. All the connections they might have had live across an ocean, in a country where my dad had a price on his head, thanks to altercations with the local mob.

        I hope you choke on that cash. You're a fucking moron if you think your life is at all modest or has anything on common with the normal people of this country.

       Notice how I said '08-'13. In 2013, the political situation in Ukraine went to shit. My dad's business, which relied on a 60-40 split of Russian and Ukrainian clients went under in just a year. My family went from being in the 1% to having a negative net worth. My parents now live in a $40ish grand home in upstate NY and are below the poverty line. At this point in my life, the only money I have access to comes from my paycheck. I'm not starving, but you'd have to be a moron to call me rich. I drive the sake Honda I drove ten years ago. I've had several moments where I've had to choose between paying for gas  and food. Believe me, I'm not as clueless as you're trying to make me out to be.

       I understand why you'd write up a comment like the one I'm responding to. But hating me for having the privilege of living a great life for 5-7 years and ignoring my underlying argument won't make your life any better.

       If you're going by strict interpretations of the original Constitution, it's pretty simple.  I don't fuck with you don't fuck with me, government should have as small a role possible to defend the country and enforce contracts and the like, no law should be passed infringing upon people's Free Will and inherent personal freedoms so long as they don't harm anybody.  There's plenty of room for wiggling and to go over the minutiae, so long as the original principal and intent of the Constitution is followed.

       Of course there needs to be some regulations to protect the general welfare of the people, but that's less important than the actual framework and inner workings of the government itself, which is highly flawed and full of corruption that needs to be excised.

       It's about the degree of the fighting. Far less than 1% of the population is engaged in any kind of open protest and/or fighting, and none of it really does anything to disrupt economic stability. Most people are working hard and paying taxes. However, this protest gets magnified by the media and causes a much larger percentage of people to be mistrustful of their fellow countrymen, and less apt to work together (through electoral politics or community organizing etc.)
      </p>
      <p>
       So I would say it's less about open fighting in the streets, but more about making the working class (which includes the middle class) think they have more differences amongst themselves than they do with the truly rich.

       That's the comment I replied to. I didn't see any arguements. And the rare earth's have been a target for a long time. Afghanistan has the largest reserves of rare earths on the planet besides China's reserves. The US government has been drooling over it for decades.

       Although newspapers take sides, they are as much part of the establishment as anyone else. They are there to make money. Ignoring Trump or any news that is just theory as non-news, means no sales. No sales means New York Times falls into a small town paper, or in terms of online status, less advertising, and less traffic. Its a double edged sword for knowing what to do to make the change, versus blaming the other side to keep sales going and people arguing.

       This pretty much nails what I was trying to get across. My parents bought the home we lived in for 20+ years in the early nineties for ~140k, they sold it last year for over $350k. I'm pretty sure it was under 3,000 sq. ft too. A 1995 chevy tahoe was $29k MSRP for 4 door and 4 wheel drive, a 2018 base model tahoe with 4wd starts at $51k MSRP, granted there are electronics and far better safety features, a car almost doubling in price while incomes have remained stagnant is just one of the many reasons people are saying 'millenials are ruining X and Y, millenials aren't saving, millenials aren't spending enough, etc.'

       The thing for me is that at least they are trying.  Ya maybe it is a feigned effort and they really dont care, but they are at least working towards being an actual leftist party.  Republicans do nothing but actually help the rich.

       Iv met a few 1%s and all of them have been amazeing people, they have donated more money in a year then ill probably make in a decade. 'The Rich' is a horrible term to use when applying hate. Your calling for hard working people who have made their mony over many years. 1% is still way to large of a percentage maybe .1% the billionaires. Yes you earn a lot to be in the 1% some cities $650k annually up to $1.5m to make the minimum amount for 1% status. These are hard working Americans that deserve the wealth earned. $1.5m annually is pocket change compared to the billionaires. I am not a rich man, I dont own a home. I have no problems with 'the rich' I have a problem with billionaires controleing our country holding its people as slaves. Don't blindly hate people, look at there actions in life and not just what others say.

       That was my point. The part specific to republicans was followed up by an addendum that I may be seeing them as worse because of a majority bias. I'm not sure what other way I can express my belief while still giving benefit of the doubt to the opposing view and the possibility, and even plausibility that I could be wrong or not fully objective.

       Hey if you want to read deeper into this notion - read The Philosophy of Fascism by Mario Palmieri from 1936. It's hard to read with a partisan attitude because its so easy to see how it embodies "the Other Side" no matter which side you're on.

       Careful there... There's nothing wrong with being rich. Its getting rich via profiting off of others loss that's the distasteful bit. There are plenty of "rich" people out there who give tons back to their employees and/or communities. Class warfare is the last thing we need right now. I mean true class warfare. That's how you end up like Venezuela.

       I'm pretty sure if they had just went to the negotiating table and asked for fair compensation for slaves around 1858, they would have had it. But they went with open rebellion instead. You can't do that and then turn around with your tail between your legs and ask in 1865.

       We need to focus on straight fact based reporting news outlets, though I don't know what you guys suggest.  AP, Reuters?  Take the talking heads and biased analysis out of the news and just focus purely on what is actually happening.  The confusion and conflict come from the "entertainment" aspect of media analysis.

       I don't even live in the US I am a neutral 3rd part with zero stake in the whole thing. Yes the left exists with people and though processes, but it sure as fuck doesn't exist as something with any political power or voting presence. Anyone who legitimately believes that there is an actual left political party in the US with any semblance of power is the one with the scrambled brain. American politics are shifted so far right its not even a debate topic at this point in time.

       I think we are all to blame for trends in media coverage, because we are the ones reading, clicking, and watching the divisive stories. A solution to this dilemma begins with each of us looking inward and detaching from our own biases and tribal instincts.

       Thank you. Every time Trump refers to any TV news outlet as "fake news" the media conglomerate in possession of that brand jizz in their pants. When it comes to print media it can be even more personal (profitable). Lets just all keep dividing until were conquered but in the meantime make sure to open fire on politicians no one cares about because they are NOT YOUR PEOPLE. Dont forget to drive a car into a crowd of NOT YOUR PEOPLE while the allies march in support of stone effigies.

       This is due to how much tracking and stats the media has access to.  Just like google can guess who you are an Amazon can guess what you buy before you buy it...the media has near instant results to find out what stories are generating clicks and views.  What stories get reactions.   They spin stories into being a Trump issue or race issue at times just because they want to bring up those emotions and get those views.      It's a sick social experiment that is gonna have terrible consequences in the end.

       Trump is a convenient scapegoat for those who are blind to the fact that it's the deep state that's really the one in power.  Trump is nothing and a nobody.  He's a hood ornament on a car.  The deep state's the actual car.

       Wrong. It was about how the South wanted to continue to exploit free labor and treat people as subhumans in the name of profit. If they wanted a buy out, then why is the ability to own slaves portrayed as divine right, and their mistreatment of the slaves dismissed as attempts to civilized them?
      </p>

       Sorry pal that revisionist bullshit won't fly today. The south were a bunch of filthy racists and bigots that were angry that they were being forced to recognize blacks as people and not properly.

       The GOP being fascists has nothing to do with the DNC also being fascists. Obamas war on Whistle Blowers and spying on journalists as well as extrajudiciously executing American citizens abroad for their political ideology and religious views is fascist. It's that simple. Is the GOP more brazen in their steps toward Fascism? Undeniably. But that has more to do with the accountability from the party supporters. The left has historically called out Fascism but with the
       <em>
        obfuscation
       </em>
       of the core tenets of the ideology, the party leadership has been emboldened. The had the audacity to label their movement "The Third Way" (let's not pretend like we don't know what a dog whistle is) - go ahead and do a search for "The Third Way + Mussolini" then again switching Mussolini for Bill Clinton.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also seriously take the time to read The Philosophy of Fascism by Mario Palmieri from 1936. It's actually pretty chilling.

       I'd gladly do that tomorrow if it was discovered that cars were sapient beings. But since that's not going to happen, the analogy makes no sense. They didn't want to take the property away, they just realized that people aren't property. There's no moral high ground to be had; stop grasping for it.

       Obviously not all those who voted for him did so because they hate mexicans or muslims or whatever, that's an unfair characterization. I can absolutely understand why people are frustrated with the status quo, why they feel establishment politicians don't represent them, etc. That doesn't give them a free pass for allowing themselves to be fooled by such a transparent con-man. And I really don't see any excuse for not realizing what a piece of shit he is by now.

       What other choice did they have, exactly? Clinton was probably the most status-quo establishment candidate of all time, and everyone knows 3rd parties don't have any chance. They weren't fooled - at worst, they chose the lesser of two evils. At best they chose someone who they believed would shake things up for the establishment. I think you'd be hard-pressed to argue that Trump hasn't delivered on his promise to shake up the establishment/status-quo. I feel like I'm getting exactly what I voted for, and I could give a fuck how polite Trump is to the shithead elite that have fucked us with a polite smile for decades at least.

       Lots of people felt betrayed by Obama. The establishment's obvious hatred for Trump is all the evidence I need that he's not one of them. The focus on the "alt-right" is just the media having hissy-fits; these people were the same before Trump became elected and they are not numerous or powerful at all. If anything, it was the democrats' identity politics that "emboldened" this small swathe; identity politics that became their clearest when nobody could criticize Obama for anything without being called a "racist bigot."

       I agree, but what many people don't see or remember is how the political cycle works. It's all but certain at this point that the next president will be a Dem. The problem is they will be an establishment Dem and will uphold the same shitty economic and political policies that are disenfranchising Americans both on the right and left. After their term we will assuredly get another shithead "anti-establishment" populist Republican like Trump... or worse. People seem to have forgotten that the ground for Trump was laid by Bush and Obama continued many of the Bush admins destructive economic policies which lead to voter backlash.

       I had more pressing videos but they all had cringy  titles. Thought they would put you off. Anyhow, yea from what I've seen a LOT of antifa seem to believe in socialist/anticapitalist/communist ideologies. Not really pushing any propaganda, and what is this "havoc on us soil" you speak of? I haven't heard of any, sounds like p r o p a g a n d a to me.  Also I really don't think there is a need for violence, I understand when black people were discriminated against, but I don't see why there needs to be violence here.

       lol upset that even his last rally in Phoenix was bigger than any of Hillarys rally by a factor of 100? Again, this just proves you haven't seen any of his rallies because it's not just white people there you racist piece of shit :) And because you have obvious difficulties with basic math let me explain to you why there are so many white people there. We make up the majority of the country, you fucking moron. This isn't rocket science but I'll be happy to get you a lab coat if it helps. God you're dumb lol. You're salt is some of the finest I've harvest in days so thank you.
