Breitbart&#39;s not some renegade pirate radio station. They have an agenda just like CNN, NBC, and all the rest, and you&#39;re just repeating someone else&#39;s talking point.

<p>Personally I think anyone buying into the left/right paradigm is an idiot….like you and your use of the term &quot;alt-right&quot;. Did you make that up or are you parroting something you heard on CNN?</p>

Conspiracy theory should not be politicized, especially by applying it to our polarizing left/right paradigm, the exact thing that conspiracy theory seeks to deconstruct and possibly dismantle.

It&#39;s clowns like Alex Jones and the fear mongering media that have made conspiracy theory a political hotbed. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly. I could understand a thread or two, but there&#39;s like dozens of them, so it&#39;s obviously propaganda. They&#39;re just barfing back what they read on Breitbart. New flash, Donald Trump is not your friend, y&#39;all. He&#39;s friends with the Clintons. They are buddies, pals. He&#39;s not going to &quot;lock her up,&quot; he never was. ANYONE RUNNING FOR PRES IS COMPROMISED. Sorry, had to hit the caps lock for a second there. </p>

<p>As for Alex Jones, he&#39;s a gatekeeper and his job is to bring the conspiracy fringe back into the two-party fold by pushing Trump on them. Ditch Alex Jones, find truly independent media. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s not &quot;propaganda&quot;. It&#39;s the inevitable pushback to the accepted mainstream narrative. When most every mainstream media org is left leaning and is promoting anita as some altruistic fighters of evil you will get people setting the record straight by pointing out the obvious hypocrisy in their means and message.</p>

<p>The MSM&#39;s posturing of antifa is the propaganda. You&#39;re just too biased to see or admit it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Only one of those you list has a national platform on television. Brietbart doesn&#39;t have a channel on my satellite dish. Neither does WSJ or Alex Jones.</p>

<p>None that you mentioned has the reach of NBC, CNN, ABC, MSNBC, CBS…NONE. You can obfuscate all you want and compare Alex Jones to CNN but you only make you look even more biased in doing so.</p>

<p>Is Alex Jones being piped into airports across the US? Please.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok, you admit Fox has the reach of the other networks. </p>

<p>I&#39;m sure one of Breitbart&#39;s goals is a TV network; if they continue their winning streak they will get one.</p>

<p>WSJ is a newspaper turned web site, the RW equivalent of NYTimes. Print and the web are part of the media. </p>

<li>Would it deter future retards from becoming just like antifa?</li>
</ol>

<p>I believe so. </p>

<p>It&#39;s not the first solution by any means, but it&#39;s clear they aren&#39;t intelligent enough to see how foolish they are. I&#39;m open to other options, but at this point, I don&#39;t believe any other options exist. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>For some reason, many in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> seem to think that nazis, the kkk and antifa are all morally equivalent.  I do t see why.</p>

<p>An admitted bigoted and racist group is not morally equivalent to a group that hates and violently opposes racism and bigotry.  </p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t matter that both sides are violent, I&#39;m speaking purely of ideology.  Racism and bigotry is not the same as opposing racism and bigotry.  And trying to defend a group of nazis and KKK over antifa or any other group just let&#39;s normal American k ow you are brainwashed by the false left/right divide.</p>

<p>Tldr: it&#39;s ironic that so many supposed free thinkers are brainwashed by partisan politics.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m a woman, and not pretending anything. Conspiracy theory should not be politicized, especially by applying it to our polarizing left/right paradigm, the exact thing that conspiracy theory seeks to deconstruct and possibly dismantle. If anything, conspiracy theorists are the heretics of the  traditional American politic. It&#39;s clowns like Alex Jones and the fear mongering media that have made conspiracy theory a political hotbed. </p>
