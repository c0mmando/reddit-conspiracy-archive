       Not really. Because Breitbart and Fox are mainstream now. I think Breitbart's like the #3 news site after NYTimes and CNN. Fox has been mainstream for a long time now. I consider RW talk radio to be mainstream. Basically there is no unbiased news anymore, you're gonna get someone's agenda with your info full stop. Breitbart's not some renegade pirate radio station. They have an agenda just like CNN, NBC, and all the rest, and you're just repeating someone else's talking point. Think for yourselves.

       Being critical of a violent fringe group on the far left has nothing to do with political leanings.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is what Chomsky said about Antifa: "'When confrontation shifts to the arena of violence, it's the toughest and most brutal who win – and we know who that is,' said Chomsky, a professor emeritus of linguistics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. 'That's quite apart from the opportunity costs – the loss of the opportunity for education, organizing, and serious and constructive activism.'"

       Nice subjective interpretation.

      <p>
       Personally I think anyone buying into the left/right paradigm is an idiot….like you and your use of the term "alt-right". Did you make that up or are you parroting something you heard on CNN?

       I'm a woman, and not pretending anything. Conspiracy theory should not be politicized, especially by applying it to our polarizing left/right paradigm, the exact thing that conspiracy theory seeks to deconstruct and possibly dismantle. If anything, conspiracy theorists are the heretics of the  traditional American politic. It's clowns like Alex Jones and the fear mongering media that have made conspiracy theory a political hotbed.

       Exactly. I could understand a thread or two, but there's like dozens of them, so it's obviously propaganda. They're just barfing back what they read on Breitbart. New flash, Donald Trump is not your friend, y'all. He's friends with the Clintons. They are buddies, pals. He's not going to "lock her up," he never was. ANYONE RUNNING FOR PRES IS COMPROMISED. Sorry, had to hit the caps lock for a second there.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for Alex Jones, he's a gatekeeper and his job is to bring the conspiracy fringe back into the two-party fold by pushing Trump on them. Ditch Alex Jones, find truly independent media.

      <p>
       It's not "propaganda". It's the inevitable pushback to the accepted mainstream narrative. When most every mainstream media org is left leaning and is promoting anita as some altruistic fighters of evil you will get people setting the record straight by pointing out the obvious hypocrisy in their means and message.
      </p>
      <p>
       The MSM's posturing of antifa is the propaganda. You're just too biased to see or admit it.

       What you don't understand is that Fox, WSJ, Breitbart, RW talk radio, even Alex Jones are all mainstream media.

       That old argument about "liberal bias" made sense in the 1990's, but now it's just stoopid. There's a whole right-wing MSM media ecosystem out there and they're manipulating you just as much as the NYTimes and CNN are manipulating the liberalz.

       Only one of those you list has a national platform on television. Brietbart doesn't have a channel on my satellite dish. Neither does WSJ or Alex Jones.
      </p>
      <p>
       None that you mentioned has the reach of NBC, CNN, ABC, MSNBC, CBS…NONE. You can obfuscate all you want and compare Alex Jones to CNN but you only make you look even more biased in doing so.

       Ok, you admit Fox has the reach of the other networks.

       I'm sure one of Breitbart's goals is a TV network; if they continue their winning streak they will get one.

       WSJ is a newspaper turned web site, the RW equivalent of NYTimes. Print and the web are part of the media.

      <p>
       I'll grant that liberal news dominates TV, but the RW dominates talk radio, hands down.

       It isn't obvious to me that the posts are propoganda. There are 500k users here and a lot of folks are genuinely interested in the conspiracy theory that Antifa is a paid group of rabble rousers with the purpose of causing false unrest.

       This is the whole point. Violent fringe takes away any legitimate position that side may bring to the table. Contest with Ideas not bricks. Government has more powerful means of combat, no one wins if they step in and declare free-speech as dangerous or unconstitutional.

       I go by a checklist in order to gauge effectiveness:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        Would eradicating admitted communists solve that particular problem?
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       Yes.
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        Would it deter future retards from becoming just like antifa?

      <p>
       I believe so.

       It's not the first solution by any means, but it's clear they aren't intelligent enough to see how foolish they are. I'm open to other options, but at this point, I don't believe any other options exist.

       seem to think that nazis, the kkk and antifa are all morally equivalent.  I do t see why.

      <p>
       An admitted bigoted and racist group is not morally equivalent to a group that hates and violently opposes racism and bigotry.
      </p>
      <p>
       It doesn't matter that both sides are violent, I'm speaking purely of ideology.  Racism and bigotry is not the same as opposing racism and bigotry.  And trying to defend a group of nazis and KKK over antifa or any other group just let's normal American k ow you are brainwashed by the false left/right divide.
      </p>

       Tldr: it's ironic that so many supposed free thinkers are brainwashed by partisan politics.

       I'm a woman, and not pretending anything. Conspiracy theory should not be politicized, especially by applying it to our polarizing left/right paradigm, the exact thing that conspiracy theory seeks to deconstruct and possibly dismantle. If anything, conspiracy theorists are the heretics of the  traditional American politic. It's clowns like Alex Jones and the fear mongering media that have made conspiracy theory a political hotbed.
