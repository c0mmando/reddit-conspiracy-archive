        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>So I was poking around google looking for planet 9 updates. And I noticed this on solarsystem.nasa.gov/planet9 , which I know is a legit site and notice it says this. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Planet 9&quot; is an informal nickname for a predicted but undiscovered world that may exist in the outer solar system. It also has been called <strong>&quot;Planet X&quot;</strong> and, according to a New Yorker interview with astronomer Mike Brown, &quot;Jehosephat&quot; and &quot;George.&quot; This yet unseen world does not have an official name.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Umm, I kind of had to read that a couple times, I know im reading into it kind of hard, but they always said before multiple times, there is no planet x. Anyways clicked more through it and landed at the backworld planets search for brown dwarfs, which is oddly how they are looking for planet 9 and came across this on their site, and I had noticed this before actually. zooniverse.org/projects/marckuchner/backyard-worlds-planet-9/about/research</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The WISE All-Sky Infrared Survey 
We will be scanning the Solar System&#39;s frontier using infrared images from NASA&#39;s Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) telescope. While ordinary stars and the familiar eight planets shine brightly at visible wavelengths, brown dwarfs glow mainly in the infrared. Planet nine should also glow in the infrared.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Lol what, why would planet 9 glow in the infrared. I thought maybe it was miswrote but i noticed on nasa&#39;s own freaking page.
solarsystem.nasa.gov/news/2017/02/15/nasa-funded-website-lets-the-public-search-for-new-nearby-worlds</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If Planet Nine -- also known as Planet X -- exists and is as bright as some predictions, it could show up in WISE data.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ok guys rant time here. 
They are basically REPEATING their-selves at this point. And then you realize, if planet 9 was just a cold lifeless &quot;planet&quot; and not a &quot;dark&quot; star, why the hell would they be using a thermal telescope and not traditional telescopes. They know this thing is generating heat guys, and it amazes me that people think the ice age is over, it&#39;s not, we are just in what is called a inter glacial period, they have been &quot;trying&quot; for a long time to figure out what causes the heating and the cooling effect, asteroid killed the dinosaurs? this thing probably pulled earth away far enough from the sun that it turned into a iceball. And every time it comes close to us its melting our shit with infrared rays. Or either pulling us closer or farther away from the sun. Also little known facts about brown dwarves, even though they can be the size of say, jupiter, they can have a magnetic field as strong as our own suns, they are not sure why this is. 
/endrant</p>

<p>What do you guys think, also I dont get on very much, and sometimes im scared to check my inbox (people really, really hate me, it might be a year before i get the courage to check my inbox, seriously heh), so dont be discouraged if i dont reply.</p>

<p>I see alot of comments about you guys wondering what is going on and why they are trying to keep everyone distracted by all the crazy stuff happening. </p>

<p>Ive actually come to the conclusion, its god, or its aliens playing god, but that is a entire different topic. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just feel like if there were a body with as much mass as a brown dwarf out there, it&#39;d be more evident through irregularities in the plants&#39; orbits.  Several planets were predicted based on orbits of other planets before they were actually discovered.  If there was something that had a noticeable effect on this planet from the outer solar system, it&#39;d mess with the paths of the other planets.  Doesn&#39;t mean there isn&#39;t something funky going on with it..</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is something wonky going on with our orbits though. Even the sun has a wobble to it. We&#39;ve been told it&#39;s because it&#39;s rotating around it&#39;s own center of mass, but what if that brown dwarf is knocking it off center?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Solar System center of mass is actually just outside the Sun so it does wobble. But this is caused by Jupiter.</p>

<p>There is however funky wobbling in KBO(Kupier Belt Objects). I forget it&#39;s either 5 or 8 degrees off the solar plane in certain areas. But this is part of the evidence for a very distant large planet. It&#39;s also predicted to be in the galactic plane right now. Many observatories avoid the galactic plane since it&#39;s crowded and interferes.</p>
