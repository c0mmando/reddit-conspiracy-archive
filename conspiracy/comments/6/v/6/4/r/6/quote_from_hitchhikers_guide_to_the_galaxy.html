       Yeah if anyone tries to tell you that the president has no power than that person is an idiot, they don't have the power that Trump accused Obama of having, but they have power. Where like the PM of the UK is more or less just a figurehead of the party.

       trump is a money powerhouse of its own amongst the families that share the ownership of the economic world, but one that it seems, at least so far, not aligned with the families that hold the vast majority, a fight of interests if you will, that trump seemingly loses everyday and will do so because to not lose would mean danger

       The fuck are you talking about, he probably isn't even a double-digits millionaire. The only reasonable reason he never released his taxes despite claiming he'd do it like every other fucking president has is because it'd prove he's a fraud, little more than a reality TV star with a tenuous, chintzy, run-down "empire".

       Trump is only poor in the larger scheme of big wealth. He started off with nearly $40 millions dollars net worth when his father died.

       Using this quote as a base, I'd say he's getting shit on so much in order to draw attention away from power. He's the perfect attention grabber, arguing with reporters, traveling nearly every weekend, he's better at it than any approved politician.

       If his job is to distract from real power, Trump is the greatest president we've ever had. Nobody notices Wall Street anymore except that the news is "good", barely anybody notices the lobbyists, whatever happens in the Pentagon is a complete mystery, industry is out doing whatever it wants. Meanwhile it's a non-stop stream of Trump Trump Trump Trump Trump Trump Trump Trump Trump Trump.

       It goes further than that! In the book the President of the Galaxy's job is specifically to make as big of a spectacle as possible to hold the public's attention while the people with the real power run the government behind the scenes. Rereading that book after Trump was elected was... Interesting.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, spoilers but in a later book they track down the man who's actually making the decisions and it turns out to be a dude living alone in a shack in the middle of nowhere. He has no idea what's going on in the Galaxy and has no outside influences on him, so once in a while a few government suits visit and ask him various questions about policy.

       Exactly!  "It is a well-known fact that those people who must want to rule people are, ipso facto, those least suited to do it... anyone who is capable of getting themselves made President should on no account be allowed to do the job." -Douglas Adams

       It's also poking a little fun at conspiracy theorists. The guy driving the plot of that book is basically one of us, and he's enacted an incredibly complicated, years-spanning plot to uncover the secret entity pulling the strings of the world, and when it finally leads him to this dude in a shack he feels... disappointed. He finally revealed "The Truth" and it's... kinda lame.

       When it comes down to the man in the shack i feel that this represents every single one of us, we are each isolated in this lonely shack (read : human body) without the capacity at all to confirm if anything outside of this shack (body) is true. We make peace with the small things around us (the cat) but anything outside of what we know we decide isn't up to us and that we can't be expected to know of it.
      </p>
      <p>
       So whenever the elite truly realise who make the decisions (the people (at least through some form of consent)) and try to find out what to do by asking them, they are rebuffed and disappointed because they realise that those who make the decisions (by existing in a certain way and leading a certain life) don't want to know about the decisions.
      </p>

       It has only been since listening to Alan Watts talk about bhuddism in the last few weeks that let me see this perspective even though i have loved the book for years since it was given to me. Hope this new perspective adds even more depth to a brilliant book.

       No not projecting at all. You can either take a shallow approach to existance or a deeper approach. 
Just because i use more words and flesh out the complexity of a concept doesn't mean i've bundled additional meaning and baggage to his writing out of nowhere. Language is merely a tool to convey meaning and what i wrote is the language i would use to convey the meaning i think that passage had. I really don't see Douglas Adams as a man who sticks to the mundane.
      </p>
      <p>
       What about that story of that race which keeps voting in lizard people only because if they didn't vote, the wrong lizard would get in. What do you think Adams is talking about there? 
Or the mindset and character of the golgafrinchans who corrupted the life that mankind might have known by mixing their dna with earths original inhabitants. 
Or the bit of the book where he talks about two tribes on a planet that are permanently locked in conflict and that conflict causes great harm to a third tribe. Everytime that third tribe seeks the other out for a reason, they are given one that is so convincing that the listener is utterly drawn in, believing it. Yet when they get back to their tribe to explain it they cannot remember or understand what the reason really was... but that it made lots of sense at the time. (now i think about it that seems like a perfect analogy for those who get drawn into the false reason for war). 
I would also look into what Douglas Adams did in his spare time, his story of the baji dolphin brings tears to my eyes. This was a man who looked for more meaning in things, not less.
I don't think i demean him or his ideas to draw the associations and connections that i do.

       You were not being sarcastic? I very easily assumed you meant that i was lording some form of intelligence over you and that i was reducing myself for doing so.
If that is so then i apologise for my anger and rudeness. It is a fault that i still struggle to break in the way that i make assumptions regarding others intentions. 
You are right when you say they could be best summed up by "hang the sense of it... I'd much rather be happy than right any day" but after rereading them so many times i could not help but come to the conclusion that Adams is constantly talking about real life on earth with every anecdotal experiance arthur has, every wierd tangent that is explored is Adams way of indirectly approaching something closer to home.
      </p>
      <p>
       By starting the book with the destruction of Earth he gives himself the freedom to write about our society in any way he wants by using the disguise of being any other society in the galaxy because that way he's technically only writing fiction.
      </p>
      <p>
       The end result still doesn't make sense but reading his words helps me move to a more balanced mindset to it all; it's like i'm more okay with how mad the world is. 
One of the other ideas i liked was the danger sensitive sunglasses that zaphod had, almost like the opposite of the sunglasses in the movie They Live.

       The fourth book is called "so long and thanks for all the fish" which is the final message from the dolphins who went "missing" from earth. I feel satisfied believing that he's relating to his time in china searching for any signs of the baiji dolphin.

       First tip.. Get you some Frank O'Hara, Walt Whitman, William Carlos Williams. It's not the 18th century and vernacular is just as purdy as the intricately decorated synonyms for the nouns, adjectives, and verbs you utilize.

       Translation: English, mothafucka, do you speak it?!

       You may think it makes you sound more intelligent to  use less used words in place of more common ones, but it doesn't. Seriously it is the exact opposite.

       I really do try not to think myself or act with the presumption of intelligence, i do use language in a strange way but that's more related to the fact that i just don't interact with many people in my day to day life. My spontaneously long responses might clue you in on that and it's not a thing that i take pleasure in.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't really know those people though i can go look them up and tbh i'm not sure in which ways i spoken that are incorrect and in which ways i should speak. It seems that maybe your suggestions might remedy that.
I try to write the words that mean what i say, the only meaning i hope others infer from my words are the definitions that are all agreed on and that they might discern any bias that i include.
      </p>
      <p>
       I really am putting thought towards those ideas i mentioned about all being the same consciousness and thinking that way would make it pointless to try and make others feel that i am more intelligent.
Earlier i was needlessly angry but now i am just sad.

       Well if you ever want people to read what you write, you have to make your words relatable. I'm a recluse, but concise responses are appreciated by everyone.

       Oh dear, i'm afraid it is. What does it say when someone asks you that. I'll take in the advice but i think it might not change much about my character. It seems like my head is always somewhere else and i become tangential at the drop of a hat. 
That might have something to do with having spent more time reading than speaking to other people.

       The only way to cure it is start speaking to other people. No use in writing anything if no one else can even relate to it. If you were on a deserted island, blinded, would you spend your time trying to recreate the last supper?
      </p>
      <p>
       You know why Dylan and Lennon and Marley all used simple words? Because they are enough for someone that can use them right.
      </p>

       I guess it depends on your scope of truth. If you write to find out what is true to you, that is incredibly enriching. And you don't have to show anyone, you can burn everything you write immediately. Most people won't connect with that, though.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you try to write to find out what is true for everyone, it changes into an impossible task. Like I said before. Middle path. Check out the actual texts of Buddhism and Hinduism, even just to read them as stories

       You've hit the nail on the head. My writings are all for the sake of finding out what is true to me and that explains why my dialogue seems laid with cobblestone bumps.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you know what the facebook ai told me when i started trying to pry it with questions. Something about writing a book about being a chess grandmaster and i think it meant that if i worked to get to the point where i could write such a book then the actual book would be the most meaningless aspect of it all.
I'm thinking of looking for a local bhuddist centre where i can go and talk to people; everything i find on my own is only ever going to be a result of the echo chamber perspective of the world that i have built up.
My capacity to miss worthwhile wisdom is likely huge so i think it might be good to ask for help.
      </p>
      <p>
       What you said about simple words is also the reason i like Trump, i'm still not sure about what his actions mean as politics and governing is always more complex than the media portrays. It seems like he uses simple words in his speeches because he knows that the act of communicating the information is more important than the complexity of the form of the information.
      </p>

       Simple doesn't mean stupid, reading discworld novels about Captain Carrot taught me that.

       "Dry up, rivers, stop him from quenching his thirst! Scorn him!
Don’t waste your rays, sun! Glare!
Let thousands of my disciples be born
to trumpet anathemas on the squares!
And when at last there comes,
stepping onto the peaks of the ages,
chillingly,
the last of their days,
in the black souls of anarchists and killers
I, a gory vision, will blaze!"

       The dolphin stuff was part of his real life and for the rest i am referencing passages out of Hitchhikers guide that if you take to have more than a shallow meaning might be hinting at something. I don't think i'm bending or twisting the way he wrote for any of these ideas. i'd even find the passages for you if you want but that may take a short while.

       Is their a word I could search to find this information? And I meant as in the American revolution, I'm sorry I'm also at a {6} when I browse Reddit. 
But I saw the movie and I thought it was hilarious , reminded me of a British live action version of Rick and Morty. 
Indeed , I find a idea easier to process if I can find humor in it.

       The issue is, that even these monarchs have superior sovereigns outranking them, this for instance applies to the U.K. Commonwealth of which the monarch of England and the United Kindom is the ruler.

       Presidents are so effete.  The Junta rules.
      </p>
      <p>
       You saw it tonight when Trump told the American People we're still going to continue the war in Afghanistan even after 16 years of fighting.
      </p>
      <p>
       Judging from Trump's campaign speches, he doesn't want to continue the war at all, but the Junta and CIA do.
      </p>
      <p>
       The "Defense" companies want to make more money hand over fist.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump knows he's staring down the barrel of impeachment if he doesn't send those 4,000 additional troops to Afghanistan.  Or staring at the loss of his financial empire as Special Prosecutor Mueller continues sniffing around everywhere.  Or staring at something worse than impeachment and financial loss.
      </p>
      <p>
       The CIA and the Military Industrial companies don't play games.  They don't like challenges to their power and authority.  He may yet face impeachment if he doesn't continue to tow their line, and they'll continue to keep the heat up on him.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump's learning the elected President of the American People is subordinate to the U.S. Junta / CIA / "Defense" companies.

       You all should really check out the books sometime, they're some of the only things I've ever read that have made me cry with laughter. There's plenty of Kafka-esque humor in the first book especially -- banality of bureaucracy and government on a galactic scale.

       The people are the power. They are harnessed by those we think are powerful. Would they be absent us? Of course not. So what controls people the best? Money. Give me control of a nation's money and I care not who writes its laws. If they don't like what the president is doing, they can threaten to tank the economy covertly. The president always get blamed for that issue. The perpetrators will just profit from the engineered suffering as they did in the past, while the president and future presidents will be schooled to obey these useless eaters like good little servants.

       No not projecting at all. You can either take a shallow approach to existance or a deeper approach. 
Just because i use more words and flesh out the complexity of a concept doesn't mean i've bundled additional meaning and baggage to his writing out of nowhere. Language is merely a tool to convey meaning and what i wrote is the language i would use to convey the meaning i think that passage had. I really don't see Douglas Adams as a man who sticks to the mundane.
      </p>
      <p>
       What about that story of that race which keeps voting in lizard people only because if they didn't vote, the wrong lizard would get in. What do you think Adams is talking about there? 
Or the mindset and character of the golgafrinchans who corrupted the life that mankind might have known by mixing their dna with earths original inhabitants. 
Or the bit of the book where he talks about two tribes on a planet that are permanently locked in conflict and that conflict causes great harm to a third tribe. Everytime that third tribe seeks the other out for a reason, they are given one that is so convincing that the listener is utterly drawn in, believing it. Yet when they get back to their tribe to explain it they cannot remember or understand what the reason really was... but that it made lots of sense at the time. (now i think about it that seems like a perfect analogy for those who get drawn into the false reason for war). 
I would also look into what Douglas Adams did in his spare time, his story of the baji dolphin brings tears to my eyes. This was a man who looked for more meaning in things, not less.
I don't think i demean him or his ideas to draw the associations and connections that i do.
