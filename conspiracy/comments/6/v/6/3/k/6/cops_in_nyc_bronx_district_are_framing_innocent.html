       Tldr: Innocent people are going to prison so that cops can avoid getting their asses chewed for not meeting the minimum required arrest quota set by higher ups. The mayor is fully aware of this happening.
      </p>
      <p>
       Quote:
      </p>
      <p>
       “Stop and frisk has been banned, but police in the 42nd precinct are actually doing something far worse. They are setting quotas and goals for the number of people each officer must arrest. If you don’t meet or exceed the quotas, you feel the wrath of your supervisors. Instead of rejecting the quotas, some officers are embracing them and rounding up people, particularly teenage children, for crimes they know good and well they didn’t commit — locking them away sometimes for days, weeks, months, or even years at a time — then simply dismissing the charges. This isn’t just a few rogue cops, but an entire precinct is doing this and they are partnering with the Bronx District Attorney’s Office to make it happen. With threats, and even brute force, kids are being coerced to identify and testify against people they don’t even know. Officers are terrorizing families, snatching kids out of their beds, not a few times, but dozens of times per child, sometimes arresting them on false charges, sending them to Rikers, then releasing them months later. Cops think they can do anything they want and it appears they can. Pedro is being framed. They tried to frame him over and over again before this case. And other kids are being framed too. And the kids and families who’ve been victimized by this scandal are hollow shells of their former selves. The Police Commissioner, the Comptroller, and the Mayor all know about this and are doing nothing.”

       It's not a real thing until there is evidence to back it up. If there is evidence to back it up, that's what needs to be quoted here not a story.

       I reallllllly don't like Shaun King but here's the thing - we can't wait for people we like to do the breaking news. He's a public figure putting himself on the line for this story.

       Usually you lead the story with some actual evidence telling a heart breaking story of a victim. Just having a circle jerk 'fuck the police' written across 4 parts doesn't suddenly mean every black kid in prison is there because of systemic racism.

       I agree 100%. But you can't pull that same bullshit that antifa pulls.. Categorizing everyone they doesn't agree with you as a fuckin nazi and bash their head in because they look a certain way. Those fuck heads are just as bad as the white supremacists... Open up a dialouge with people from the other side who are willing to listen and don't use violence unless you're threatened...

       Oh ya. Antifa pretends to fight evil with evil.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm talking about a peaceful approach. We need citizens to swarm the Bronx PD demanding answers and transperancy for as long as it takes. We need other citizens to support those citizens financially.
      </p>
      <p>
       We need swarms around the White House demanding deep state shills like McCain, Schumer, and Pelosi GTFO of our politics.
      </p>
      <p>
       We needs swarms around the federal reserve demanding they GTFO of our country.
      </p>
      <p>
       We don't need to use violence but we can scream and shout all we want. We need to be LOUD. We need to be united and supportive of each other even when we are strangers.
      </p>
      <p>
       This country is a fucking slave plantation and the slaves need to stand up to the slave owners and demand freedom without excuses. We need to end concent that we owe all this money to banks so don't even need it.
      </p>
      <p>
       We need to swarm banks too.
      </p>
      <p>
       We can do this all peacefully.
      </p>
      <p>
       The deep state is shit. Everyone knows that. But to be fair, nothing is going to change if good people do nothing. We are 50% of the problem at this point. We need to take action or accept enslavement but life continues to get worst under the cabal so it's better if we take peaceful action and fix our problems.
      </p>
      <p>
       Unity is the key. Antifa is trying to divide. We need to unity.

         Offer alternatives to the broken systems we have now. This one is more complex so I made one for people to use:
         <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/New_American_System/comments/6ne42s/new_government_and_economic_model_layout_model/">
          https://www.reddit.com/r/New_American_System/comments/6ne42s/new_government_and_economic_model_layout_model/
         </a>
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Rinse, repeat, and uptalk until the masses are full of desire and motivation to take matters in their own hands.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Promote peaceful swarming of cabal strongholds like the Federal Reserve using alternating leadership. Instead of 1 leader, the smartest guy in the group leads and leadership flip flops as needed. Even a group of 3 should have a leader. We use our hive mind to tackle the deep state. We raise enough ruckus to end up on MSM news and the movement spreads like wildfire.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       It's really up to each person to focus on themselves. If they can fix themselves, half the battle will be won. Before you know it, we have a whole nation of motivated, hopeful human beings ready to change the world into something that works for all of us instead of just the 1%. Unity is definitely the key when it's all said and done.

       Have you ever actually tried having a peaceful dialouge with someone who watches fox news? 
if you dont agree with everything they say and follow the mantra that the police rarely do wrong they call you a N****R LOVER.

Something along the lines of "the constitution does not protect citizens when dealing with local or state level officials.

       Maybe thats why some people would rather shoot it out and die in the streets.

       LA Naive specifically South Central and Compton, it's safe to say that police harassment has gone down significantly from what I can see. I've gone a whole year without being bothered so I feel accomplished. I went to college in the valley however and it's a different story.

       Born and raised in the Bronx. This isn't so much a conspiracy as opposed a status quo. Not saying the Bronx is a bastion of good citizens, but back in my Lehman days, my cousin and I got hassled by police for moronic things like standing/sitting on milk crates or using the chairs on the opposite side of the train your are getting on or having a bag next to us on a completely empty train/bus.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even got pulled out of busses because we look like suspects even though we can clearly hear his dispatch give a description that look nothing like us.

       Quota system is an established fact at least in NYC despite what police may say officially.

       Lehman HS? That shit was pure bullshit (education? HAH! the only thing "high" about that school was the kids doing lines off the bathroom sink!), I live on City Island and when I went to Lehman HS, compared to P.S.175, it felt like a prison. One day I intentionally got myself expelled out of that shithole and flipped out, I got kicked out because I knocked over the metal detector and X-Ray machines (it was the week after school resumed after Hurricane Sandy, so I told the school security that all of my important belongings got destroyed in the flood, which was true, so they took pity on me, an incredibly rare moment of compassion displayed on their part). I would go home on the 6 train/ Bx24 bus and cops would harass me non-stop because I was the only "white boy" (that was what the cops called me) on the train/bus. They insisted that I had "pure Heroin/Fentanyl" (no idea how to spell it because too many of my peers died on that bullshit, I'm not about to spread that H/F plague and kill more people). I would get harassed until I would mention that my friends died on that garbage (I would be in tears almost daily because I would remember my lost friends, and then insist that my attorney be present until they stopped grilling me really hard). I just can't deal with the NYPD anymore, they are "criminals with badges" according to my Father who was in the FDNY for 25+ years and saw multiple NYPD officers commit
       <em>
        blatant
       </em>
       ,
       <em>
        unconstitutional
       </em>
       crimes over and over again and never be punished for it. My Father also has pieces of the planes that hit the North and South Towers on 9/11/01, their serial #'s (as far as we have been able to discern) do NOT match United Flight 175 and American Flight 11's airframes.

       The police there are just too corrupt. I was still under the stop and frisk times. Mind you I didn't hang outside after hours or anything so all this happens in broad daylight near school or near my block.
