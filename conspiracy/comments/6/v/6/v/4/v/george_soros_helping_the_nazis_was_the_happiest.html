    <div class="md"><p>Oh, I heard him loud and clear. He &quot;didn&#39;t think it could touch him&quot; and &quot;as a kid, you don&#39;t know any better&quot;. </p>

<p>But he knows better now. He&#39;s an old man. He&#39;s spent his whole life &quot;fighting Nazis&quot; (while also paying them to help the coup in the Ukraine, oddly enough).. yet he still stays it was the happiest time in his life. </p>

<p>You&#39;re taking his words quite literally, and I&#39;m looking at the whole picture. You are, for some reason, trying to avoid realizing that Soros&#39; is not a good man, has a history of not being a good man, and has a documented past of helping fund civil rest (among other things). </p>

<p>You&#39;re hung up on this point of if he loved, or didn&#39;t love, being a Nazi. He says it was the happiest time of his life, and you&#39;re trying to say he meant something else. The same leeway, mind you, I highly doubt you give to other people. </p>

<p>In reality, that one point doesn&#39;t really matter. Look at Soros critically, and through an unbiased lens, and you&#39;ll see he&#39;s not a good man. In fact, in a great many ways, he&#39;s far worse than the Koch brothers (and they&#39;re pretty fucking bad). </p>

<p>I could go on, but you get the point. He funds violence. He meddles in foreign affairs. And he continues to meddle even after the people he claims he&#39;s &quot;helping&quot; ask him not to. </p>

<p>First, he didn&#39;t do anything, if you actually listened to the audio clip.</p>

<p>AGAIN, nowhere in the transcript does the line  &quot;Helping the Nazis was the happiest time of my life!&quot; exists.</p>

<p>Nonsense</p>

<p>Full quote</p>

<p>&quot;it&#39;s just like in markets--that if I weren&#39;t there--of course, I wasn&#39;t doing it, but somebody else would--would--would be taking it away anyhow. And it was the--whether I was there or not, I was only a spectator, the property was being taken away&quot;</p>

<p>It&#39;s not there, which is why you can neither link to the transcript or the video where he actually said those words</p>

<blockquote>

<p>This is hilarious coming from someone who is supporting a total fabrication to advance a narrative. If Soros did or said something awful, present evidence for that, why the fuck are you making stuff up is my question. What do you gain by lying about others.</p>

<p>You are making two claims. The first is he never admitted to helping the Nazis. That&#39;s patently false, and I quoted you the exact quote from the transcript. </p>

<p>The second claim is he never helping the Nazis was the happiest time of his life. I quoted where he said Germany occupancy was the happiest time. I then said you heard it differently than I did. Neither of us are right, and neither of us are wrong, because we&#39;re not Soros and we don&#39;t know what he &quot;truly&quot; meant. </p>

<p>And I quoted you the part where he did NOTHING other than simply being present - he did nothing other than pretend to be a non-jew, there were no further actions from him</p>

<p>That&#39;s not same as the quote now is it - I was the happiest under George W. Bush&#39;s rule because I was young and didn&#39;t care for politics, does that mean I was happy because I was helping George W Bush invade Iraq or whatever? You see the difference?</p>

<p>I don&#39;t understand why you have to lie - if someone is evil you can just quote them (like Hitler), there is no need to make stuff up about Hitler or Stalin to show their evil, why can&#39;t you do that instead of making stuff up????????????</p>

<p>Also, I trashed Trump for months when I suspected him of bending the knee to the deep state. I moreso support him now because I think he is playing 4D chess. I might change my stance on him tomorrow but I support him right now. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d like to hear an extended version of this interview rather than just a forty second snippet to hear the context in which the statement is framed. I do find it interesting that  ethnic Germans from that era are given a free pass from people on this sub to argue that they weren&#39;t really Nazis and they had no idea what was going on around them, but this, at the time, fourteen year old boy is supposed to have known the intimate details of the extent of the Holocaust against his own people. No one here was there to know how life was presented to him during that period, but it doesn&#39;t matter because OmGz!! hE&#39;S tHe JeWIsH bOOgEyMaN!!</p>

<p>But, wait! I thought the Holocaust never happened/the numbers are made up! Convenient how these things can so easily change depending on whom one is trying to condemn/absolve.</p>

<p>This I agree with. I&#39;ve looked for the more complete interview but I ran out of time last night/this morning to keep watching hour long interviews with the man to find the exact interview. </p>

<p>As for everything else you post, I think the holocaust happened. I&#39;m not one of those who deny it. I also think Soros was likely only doing what he had to do to survive. </p>

<p>That said, I also think it&#39;s extremely hypocritical of him to be &quot;fighting the Nazis&quot; knowing full well he was helping them. Not only that, because that can be explained away.. but he also has a history of FUNDING neo-nazi groups to help his cause. </p>
