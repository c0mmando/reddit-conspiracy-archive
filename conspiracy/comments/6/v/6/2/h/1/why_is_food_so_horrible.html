        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>When I was forty pounds overweight and my doctor thought I had a heart attack and I needed a lot of dental work I decided to change.</p>

<p>It was almost a miracle.  I lost 50 pounds! And I can walk 20 miles at almost 60 years old.  My diet is extreme but you don&#39;t have to take it to this level.  I eat almost all raw root vegetables, raw grains and greens and non-wheat pasta.  Reishi mushrooms are a miracle all by themselves.  The non-wheat isn&#39;t because wheat is bad but because I believe it&#39;s because of  the chemicals they use to grow and harvest it.  I eat no meat and very little fish.</p>

<p>Why would the TPTB feed us stuff that is almost excrement.  My dog won&#39;t even eat a lot of this stuff!  I think because it&#39;s economical for them!  And to maintain their empire.  We are just gears in the machine not meant to last too long.  The food is designed to be optimized to maintain their slaves until they are too old and expendable.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Plenty of local options in most areas. No national chains because it&#39;s hard to scale, ingredients can&#39;t be stored for long and microwaved, or sourced from the major food suppliers. </p>

<p>Look at In N Out - they use fresh meat and insist on the best quality. This has prevented them from scaling up nationwide. They couldn&#39;t even get outside of the California region until a few years ago. </p>

<p>It&#39;s all about serving the lowest quality shit food at an ever increasing price.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s untrue.  </p>

<p>Every day, more solar energy falls on the U.S. than we use in an entire year.  If we grew plants wisely with this much energy it would be way too much food.</p>

<p>There was a man in Africa who was dirt poor and just had his land and somehow he managed to prosper by figuring out how to &#39;harvest&#39; the water to grow plants.</p>

<p>I was so sick from prescription medicine and the job that weekends were spent lying in bed mostly.</p>

<p>You have to also find plant protein that&#39;s complete like quinoa and try to include it.  I buy the pasta.  And sometimes I cook the grain which is easier to cook than rice.  quinoa is a pseudo grain and is actually more related to spinach than other true grains!  It&#39;s a fascinating plant.</p>
