       When I was forty pounds overweight and my doctor thought I had a heart attack and I needed a lot of dental work I decided to change.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was almost a miracle.  I lost 50 pounds! And I can walk 20 miles at almost 60 years old.  My diet is extreme but you don't have to take it to this level.  I eat almost all raw root vegetables, raw grains and greens and non-wheat pasta.  Reishi mushrooms are a miracle all by themselves.  The non-wheat isn't because wheat is bad but because I believe it's because of  the chemicals they use to grow and harvest it.  I eat no meat and very little fish.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why would the TPTB feed us stuff that is almost excrement.  My dog won't even eat a lot of this stuff!  I think because it's economical for them!  And to maintain their empire.  We are just gears in the machine not meant to last too long.  The food is designed to be optimized to maintain their slaves until they are too old and expendable.

       I don't understand why no company has opened a healthy vegan fast food chain.  It would do killer business.  Vegan recipes are not hard or expensive.  The powers that be want everyone eating meat and dairy.  Keeps us dumb in a way I've not yet understood.

       Plenty of local options in most areas. No national chains because it's hard to scale, ingredients can't be stored for long and microwaved, or sourced from the major food suppliers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look at In N Out - they use fresh meat and insist on the best quality. This has prevented them from scaling up nationwide. They couldn't even get outside of the California region until a few years ago.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's all about serving the lowest quality shit food at an ever increasing price.

       But everyone I know would pay a few bucks more for a healthy quick option.  All major fast food companys spend 10s of millions each year on developing new items.  No reason that time and effort should always result in unhealthy crap.  They make it unhealthy on purpose.

       There is an Israeli chain called Maoz which serves falafel, some of the tastiest I have ever eaten. They have a restaurant near Columbia U. Wish it would take off nationwide. Also it would be good if someone could do the Taco Bell or Panda Express treatment for Indian food.

       I live in a city that has plenty of vegan options, fortunately.  I will never go back to eating meat.  Sometimes I mistakenly order something from a  restaurant that has meat in it though.  Another fortunate thing is that beer is vegan!
      </p>
      <p>
       There is no reason to eat meat except to be cruel to animals and damage the environment.

       It's clarified with isinglass(sp?) which is made from fish bones IIRC. Not all beers are, maybe do a search for vegan beers. I believe German beers are vegan by law.

       there seems to be a disagreement on whether GMO or modern farming practices produce better yields.  That this article points out that they weren't exactly comparing oranges to oranges but oranges to apples. I'm unable to tell which is correct.

       That's untrue.

       Every day, more solar energy falls on the U.S. than we use in an entire year.  If we grew plants wisely with this much energy it would be way too much food.
      </p>
      <p>
       There was a man in Africa who was dirt poor and just had his land and somehow he managed to prosper by figuring out how to 'harvest' the water to grow plants.

       There is so much sun falling on the southwest deserts we can grow food there. Oh, wait we can just take it from somewhere else.

       Why is it that if one person is able to do something successfully people believe that everyone would be able to do it?

       Sometimes food is the #1 conspiracy on my list, because it is so fundamental. Glad you found your way. How do you eat
       <em>
        raw

       root veggies though, that sounds intense?

       I had to experiment and find what I like.  It's just me but I like raw greens and roots in just vinegar and oil with a little salt.  It took literally a few years.

       You have to also find plant protein that's complete like quinoa and try to include it.  I buy the pasta.  And sometimes I cook the grain which is easier to cook than rice.  quinoa is a pseudo grain and is actually more related to spinach than other true grains!  It's a fascinating plant.

       My problem now is I'm so obsessed that I make too much!

       you chose to eat it.   You chose the pizza, burgers, fries.  These foods are
       <em>

       not good for us.

       if you had just stuck to a "cook most meals yourself" approach, you'd see that food isn't that bad.  Only processed foods is - but everyone knows it already.

       You are basically correct.  I learned this the hard way but when you travel and are overworked its really hard.  I had a 24 hour grocery close to me and I would shop there before work.  Now that I'm retired it's much easier.

       I had a coworker who went to the trouble of preparing a really nice salad for lunch and then drench it with the worst dressing imaginable!  I had a boss with diabetes who would still gorge himself on donuts.  I had another coworker who was at least 100 pound overweight and I tried to get him to try some vegetarian food and he couldn't eat it and opted for the bargain one pound plate of orange chicken!

       But everyone I know would pay a few bucks more for a healthy quick option.  All major fast food companys spend 10s of millions each year on developing new items.  No reason that time and effort should always result in unhealthy crap.  They make it unhealthy on purpose.

       There is an Israeli chain called Maoz which serves falafel, some of the tastiest I have ever eaten. They have a restaurant near Columbia U. Wish it would take off nationwide. Also it would be good if someone could do the Taco Bell or Panda Express treatment for Indian food.
