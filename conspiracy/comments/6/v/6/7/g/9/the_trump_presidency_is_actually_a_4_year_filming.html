        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I know this sounds a bit over the top crazy, but this is why Trump is firing so many members of his staff. They are secretly shooting a season of The Apprentice: White House, which will be revealed once Trump&#39;s term ends. It also explains all the crazy behaviour by Trump, it&#39;s all &quot;reality TV acting&quot;.</p>

<p>This will be the most insane season of The Apprentice, ratings will probably be through the roof and it will make a TON of money for Trump and the producers of the show. I&#39;m sure there are more to this that I&#39;m missing though.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe as Americans we have that privilege as seeing the rest of the world as such. The American empire gets to conduct and create whatever it does over there, far away from us: in places like Syria, Afghanistan and Iraq. In places like France a state of emergency is in place for ever. Americans are insulated from the horrors of war. That&#39;s until foreign armies actually land on US shores, going city to city. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I knew Trump would be firing people left and right, once he got into the White House. Because he did it as a candidate. The dude had three different campaign managers during the race.</p>

<p>That&#39;s unprecedented.</p>

<p>Trump is NOT afraid to fire people. </p>

<p>Usually, government is inefficient and incompetent because people get to be lifers. No matter how badly they do, they get to retain their positions (denying competent people the slots).</p>

<p>As I watched the dumpster-fire of her campaign, I was veritably screaming for Hillary to fire her shitty campaign manager Robby Mook. He was incompetent.</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t even like Hillary. But I wanted a robust and honest contest of ideas. Instead, Hillary was persona non grata for 3/4ths of her campaign while Trump was working his butt off. He was filling up three stadiums a day. Meanwhile Hillary would disappear for months at a time.</p>

<p>Bill Clinton was begging the campaign to address the economic plight of working families. And Mook shot him down. &quot;No, no, what America cares about is transsexual toilets,&quot; said the gay 34 year-old campaign manager.</p>

<p>Turns out the aging club kid didn&#39;t have his finger on the pulse of the culture (like the former President did).</p>

<p>As Bill Clinton was saying, &quot;Go to the Midwest. Talk about jobs, jobs, jobs,&quot; Robby Mook was like, &quot;We need to tell the white working class that they deserve to die. Whites are the cancer of the world. We need identity politics, and race-hate.&quot;</p>

<p>At any rate, you get the point: Hillary needed to fire his ass. As a Trump-voter, I say this unequivocally: She could have won. Easily. She had every institutional advantage. Every newspaper in the nation endorsing her. Every TV station shilling for her. The entire Swamp (and all the lifers) behind her.</p>

<p>Basically, Robby Mook cost her that election with his malfeasance and &quot;tranny toilet&quot; campaign strategy . . . instead of the bread-and-butter issues that Bill Clinton asked for (and Trump ran on).</p>
