        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">28</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2017-08-22 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/Prester_Jane.html">Prester_Jane</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Greetings r/conspiracy. My name is Prester Jane and I am a reformed extremist. I was raised in a hardcore authoritarian cult (I didn&#39;t even have a Social Security Number until I was 14) that had its own school and was subjected to considerable mental conditioning and ritual abuse. In my teen years I rebelled against the cult and left it- only to spend the next 15 years joining one cult after another. Eventually I hit rock bottom (which for me was homelessness) and admitted that the problem was me. I got myself some help (thank god for the <em>Haven for Hope</em> in San Antonio, Texas) and was able to be successfully deprogrammed. I have been in recovery for five years now.</p>

<p>I have spent the past several years writing a detailed psychological framework that explains how authoritarians think and function with an aim to demystify and humanize authoritarians. I call this the &quot;Narrativist Framework&quot;. I am currently in the process of putting the Narrativist Framework into a publicly viewable format (it has been primarily developed with the support of a small community on a paywalled forum) in order to do my bit in the resistance. <a href="http://prestersperspective.blogspot.com/p/narrativist-framework-preface.html">You can read the entire thing at this link.</a> (Takes about 90 minutes to go through the entire thing, most people do it in 2-3 sessions.)</p>

<p>While I am not an academic a fair number of academics have reviewed/supported my work during its development. The general consensus is that many of my ideas have similar counterparts in the academic world, however the way I have connected these ideas is quite novel as well as many of my ideas having their own distinct shade. (Evaporative cooling for example is very similar to my concept of a <a href="http://prestersperspective.blogspot.com/p/narrativist-framework-compaction-cycle.html">Compaction Cycle.</a>  Many people have commented that after familiarizing themselves with the Narrativist Framework they are able to more readily process and understand what is happening with Trump. In point of fact at present it is possible to watch many of the concepts in the Narrativist Framework demonstrate themselves in real time among Trump supporters.</p>

<p>As you can imagine, there is no TLDR for such material- authoritarians are fundamentally processing reality in a very different manner than you and I and understanding an authoritarian means understanding the different way they are experiencing the exact same events.</p>

<p>I will be monitoring this thread and will be more than happy to answer any questions about the Narrativist Framework. I am interested in getting a dialogue going around my work because I think it provides the best way presently available to understand authoritarians and how they rose to such prominence in the modern American zeitgeist.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Extremely common, yes. Most of the people I have known who escaped cults often fell into several different cults before coming to grips with the aspect of themselves that made them vulnerable to joining cults. It is not a quick process and is really only overcome by developing a great deal of self-awareness.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>According to a stunning Fusion investigation, <strong>80 percent of women and girls crossing into the U.S. by way of Mexico are raped during their journey.</strong> That’s up from a previous estimate of 60 percent, according to an Amnesty International report.</p>

<p>This year alone, immigration authorities expect more than 70,000 unaccompanied minors to come through the United States unlawfully, the majority of whom are from Central American countries of El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras. The number of unaccompanied Central American girls caught at the Southwest border has rapidly outpaced the number boys, according to a July Pew Research study.</p>

<p>Through May, the number of unaccompanied girls younger than 18 caught at the US-Mexico border increased by 77 percent.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Im not even a right winger but the massive straw man against Trump perpetuated by the mainstream media has no place here. He absolutely did not appeal to white supremecy nor did he advocate for violence. What he did do was comdem white supremacists and antifa / far left extremists for inciting violence. Saying he advocates for purging undesirables is a huge stretch. Nationalism isn&#39;t a bad thing, notice how they have started using the words nationalist and supremist interchangeabley on the news? That&#39;s a dirty classical conditioning trick to get us to immediately associate nationalism with white supremecy. Like it or not Trump is antiestablishment and he&#39;s fighting the good fight against the deepstate terrorists. Border control and immigration are important issues to a lot of Americans but conflating these issues to things they clearly aren&#39;t to suit you own political biases only makes you sound less credible. Also guess what, the deep state globalist elite are the the ones pushing for open borders and a huge influx of immigrants, divide and conquer <a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2016-07-08/how-george-soros-singlehandedly-created-european-refugee-crisis-and-why">http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2016-07-08/how-george-soros-singlehandedly-created-european-refugee-crisis-and-why</a></p>
